I was 19 at that time. The breakup for me was horrible. It took me almost 3 years to come out of it

After that I hadn't dated a girl till now. I guess I was underconfident and was worried about how girls would perceive me or not find me interesting

Recently I had asked out a girl who I liked from a long time. We had been talking for 2 months and she got me out of my shell, she used to send her morning coffee pictures, talk about her day etc. I took her out on a date and it went pretty well. We talked for hours even though we already knew a bit about each other

For next few days, I started to become a little desperate and was trying to meet her too many times. She later told me she was not very serious and she knew I was and she wanted to take things slow. Later she stopped texting me, we barely hung out

I started getting depressed, had anxiety, difficulty in sleeping, even had minor panic attacks thinking why I loved her so much and got nothing in return. I asked her politely (did not disclose these things) that I don't see this going anywhere

She tells me she is just like that and doesnt like investing in relationships too much. She said she would start meeting more often and talk more but it's again the same. No messages from her at all. I don't want to be the one to text her as this is what happens always

Why can't I just see this as a rejection and move on? Why am I fixated on her so much that I cry randomly sometimes, get depressed when there are no people around me? Will I get over it? Will I find someone who will atleast love me half as much as I love them?

After the first learning phase from very beginner with medium/dark to dark beans, I reached thick, well distributed, creamy flow.

With my usually puck prep I have never faced the spray type channeling.

I got those beans from a small Italian Roastery (colombia, peru and guatemala) and starts the nightmare:

I dialed in 1:2/2.5 in 25-30s, coffee tastes quite good, with good balance, sometimes too sour or astringent. 

but the flow looks watery, not well distributed, droppy. Very thin crema layer, often with bubbles.
And then, no matter the grind size, dose, filter, temperature, the flow looks always like this (or worst), I have made more than 30 attempt shots.
With coarser grind/less dose -> shorter time
With finer grind/more dose -> longest time (until machine chokes)

The roasting date is not indicated, just ""use by"" date.
The coffeeshop owner says that the coffees have been roasted from 2 to 6 months ago...

Is this kind of flow OK for medium roast? Or I could obtain the creamy and thick flow with good crema in the cup?

If not, can it be due to the not super fresh coffee? To the not fully open shower? To the machine pressure (now is 9 bar)? To the the less performance of vibratory pump compared to the rotary one?

1h0iatj,https://www.reddit.com/r/luxurycandles/comments/1h0iatj/thoughts_on_facsimile_candles_canadian_brand/,Thoughts on Facsimile candles (Canadian brand)?,"Not sure if this counts as “luxury” but bear with me!

I recently purchased a Diptyque Feu de Bois candle and was blown away by how much I loved it. I immediately started to search for a dupe because I love it and don’t want to be without it but don’t want to spend $100 CAD all the time. I was eying the Tatine Woodsmoke one but sadly the price conversion and shipping don’t really make it worth shipping to Canada for me. 

I was reading various reviews on this subreddit and found a comment mentioning the Canadian brand Facsimile (from the brand itself, mentioning they had a dupe of some candle, can’t remember what), which appealed to me because a lot of the smaller indie or dupe brands are American and once I convert to CAD and add in shipping, the candle is basically $75 CAD anyway. 

I searched for them here and didn’t see anyone discussing them. I figured I’d take the plunge and ordered the following:

- [No. 063: Fir Needle, Cedar, Sandalwood](https://shopfacsimile.com/products/no-063-fir-needle-cedar-sandalwood-thymes-frasier-fir)(inspired by Thymes Frasier Fir)

Each is $28CAD and I signed up for their newsletter, which gave me a 20% off code for ordering 5. All in I paid about $100CAD for all 5 (including tax and shipping). 

Anyway, the Thymes one has an unbelievably strong cold throw and smells exactly like the real thing, as far as I can tell. I wasn’t sure about the cold throw on the Diptyque FdB one — a bit weak and I didn’t think the notes were right. I’m burning that one right now so I will reserve judgement until I’ve burned it for a while. 

Anyway, i’d be happy to come back with reviews of the candles, if that’s appropriate since they’re not “true” luxury. 

Also — not affiliated with this brand in any way. Just thought I’d let other people know, especially other Canadians since we don’t have that many dupe brands we can order from. ",2,1732644251.0,luxurycandles,0,1.0,False
1h0ialw,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h0ialw/what_coffee_machine_makes_the_best_coffee/,What Coffee Machine Makes The Best Coffee?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect cup of joe, and I thought I'd share my experiences with different coffee machines. After testing countless options over the years, I've finally found what works best.

First off, let me be clear - there's no one-size-fits-all answer. But I can definitely point you in the right direction based on what you're looking for. I personally went through several machines before finding my holy grail.

For everyday brewing, I've found that drip coffee makers with precision temperature control and pre-infusion features make consistently great coffee. The key is finding one that maintains the right water temperature (195-205°F) throughout the brewing process.

However, if you're into espresso, you might want to consider a different route. I recently discovered an amazing machine that does both - it's versatile enough for regular coffee and espresso drinks. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

What really matters is the brewing method and how it affects taste. French press machines give you that rich, full-bodied flavor, while pour-over makers deliver clean, bright notes. Bean-to-cup machines are awesome if you want everything automated, but they require more maintenance.

Temperature control is crucial - I learned this the hard way. Machines that can't maintain proper heat often produce bitter or weak coffee. The best coffee makers I've used have PID temperature controllers, which make a huge difference in taste consistency.

Here's something many people overlook: water quality. Even the best machine won't make great coffee with poor water. I always use filtered water, and it's made a massive difference in taste.

For those interested in exploring different options, I've found some great deals here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. There's everything from basic brewers to high-end espresso machines.

Don't forget about grind size and freshness! The best machine won't help if you're using pre-ground coffee that's been sitting around for months. I always grind my beans right before brewing.

What works best for me might not be perfect for you, but these guidelines should help you find your ideal match. Think about your morning routine, budget, and how much time you want to spend making coffee. Some people love the ritual of manual brewing, while others prefer pushing a button and walking away.

The bottom line? The best coffee machine is one that fits your lifestyle and consistently delivers the taste you love. Just make sure it has good temperature control and matches your preferred brewing method.

Remember to clean your machine regularly - it makes a huge difference in taste and longevity. Trust me, I learned that lesson after some pretty funky-tasting brews!",1,1732644240.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1h0i9rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1h0i9rh/the_marxist_theory_of_class_is_outdated_and/,The Marxist theory of class is outdated and unhelpful compared to simply tabulating wealth.,"I'm referring defining class by their relationship to the means of production rather than the simpler and more useful method of tabulating wealth.

Look, Marx's class theory was useful in his time. As industrialization took off in the 1800s, there was a clear dividing line between the owners and the laborers. It makes complete sense to build a critique of political economy based on property ownership. However, when the lines are blurred, this theory of class falls apart when applying it to a modern economy (using the US as an example) in 2024. How?

1) Most ""bourgeoisie"" are small struggling business owners who lose money or barely break even. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg are not typical. Your average ""CEO"" looks like Juan who runs a small landscaping business, Dave who owns a small coffee shop on the corner, or Janet who runs a small consultancy. At this point, someone is going to call me out on the difference between *haute bourgeoisie* vs. *petite bourgeoisie*. Yeah, CEOs of large companies work like dogs. Where do you draw the distinction between haute vs. petite? Oh, it must be whether they need to work or don't need to work in order to survive, right? How do we determine that? Could it be, *gasp*, their amount of wealth?

2) Those in the ""proletariat"" can now earn very high incomes. Your typical physician clears north of $300k/yr. A senior engineer at Google earns $400k a year. Is he struggling? Well maybe not because he gets paid so much in stock, perhaps that makes him part of the owner class, except...

3) Most people (in the US) own stock. That stock technically makes them owners in a business that they don't provide labor for. Now, you could say that it must be a *significant* amount of stock ownership to qualify. Okay, we can have that discussion on how where ""significant"" is, but that would ultimately come down to the degree of stock ownership... which would be defined by wealth. We've come full circle.

4) Wealth categorizes material conditions more precisely than ownership, and that's what people intuit anyway. The owner of a small restaurant has more in common with an electrician when they're both taking home $90k a year. An orthopedic surgeon has more in common with the founder of a 100 person startup when they're both taking home $1M+ a year. 

If you want to talk about class conflict, then talk about wealth or income inequality. Marxist class definitions are unhelpful in a modern economy when we could use wealth as a definition instead.",1,1732644188.0,CapitalismVSocialism,1,1.0,False

As it continues to gain traction around the globe, Bitcoin's influence transcends financial transactions, inspiring a vibrant culture that celebrates innovation and individual empowerment.

 

In coffee shops and local markets, Bitcoin is making waves as more businesses accept it as a form of payment. From artisan bakers to tech-savvy startups, entrepreneurs are embracing Bitcoin to offer their customers a modern and efficient way to transact. This shift is not only convenient but also reflects a growing movement toward a cashless society where digital currencies play a pivotal role in everyday commerce.

 

Beyond transactions, Bitcoin has sparked a wave of creativity across various artistic disciplines. Musicians, visual artists, and filmmakers are harnessing the power of blockchain technology to create unique and verifiable works of art. The rise of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) is just one example of how Bitcoin’s underlying technology is being used to empower artists and reshape the creative economy, allowing them to connect directly with their audiences in new and exciting ways.

 

Moreover, Bitcoin has become a powerful symbol of resilience and independence. In a world where traditional financial systems can feel restrictive, Bitcoin offers individuals a chance to take control of their own financial destinies. Whether through investing, trading, or simply using Bitcoin for daily purchases, people from all walks of life are discovering the freedom that comes with adopting this digital currency.

 

The community surrounding Bitcoin is also thriving, with numerous meetups, conferences, and online forums where enthusiasts gather to share knowledge, ideas, and experiences. This sense of camaraderie fosters a supportive environment where individuals can learn from one another and grow together in their understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape.

 

As Bitcoin continues to evolve, its cultural impact only grows stronger. It is shaping not only the future of finance but also the way we view creativity, community, and individual empowerment. With each passing day, Bitcoin solidifies its status as a revolutionary force, inspiring a new generation to embrace the digital economy and its boundless possibilities.

The police were baffled. There were no signs of forced entry, no tire tracks leading away, and no witnesses who had seen the van disappear. The surveillance cameras in the area had malfunctioned that morning, leaving no digital record of the incident.

As days turned into weeks, the mystery deepened. Experts were called in to analyze the scene, but they couldn't provide any concrete answers. Some speculated about a freak accident, perhaps a sinkhole or a sudden flash flood. Others suggested a more sinister explanation, a carefully planned heist or a supernatural event.

Is this legal? Personal property destruction?,"Hi everyone. I work in a veterinary hospital. We have different areas in the hospital where animals are and where they aren’t, but for the most part, the animals are pretty much everywhere. We have a spot in the back where the doctors will bring the animals back to perform their physical exams/shots/any type of sedation or anything that needs to be done. We have computers and high desks back there. A lot of the girls will leave their drinks back there, but will always leave them behind the computers, or covered up in a corner by binders, or out of the way of the animals.  We haven’t had a spill or anything like that in over two years. 

Our boss has recently been on a drill sergeant  tirade, and here’s the issue. Yes there are signs in the back that if you’re back here without a cap or a top on it, it will be thrown away. So lots of people will be on their way to the very, very, very, very back, which is the only place we are allowed to put our drinks, and if someone needs help grabbing blood or restraining an animal, they will sometimes sit their drinks down. They will come back and she will chuck them without asking who they belong to. Very demeaning, disrespectful, and quite honestly it feels like we’re in a boot camp setting. Is this legal? Considering the drinks are bought by employees and they are their personal property. Does it make it legal for her to actually throw them away just because she has signs up everywhere? Shouldn’t it be something more like if your drink is back here, you will get written up or a verbal warning? Rather than throwing away a drink that someone spent their money on? And just for reference most veterinary technicians are only making anywhere between $19-$25 an hour. We’re not making anything near what human nurses make. So a lot of us have an allowance that we give ourselves for these Red Bulls/coffees/whatever drinks they are. And for the most part, we do abide by the rules, but sometimes people do forget or like I said something happens and we set them down really quickly.

I’ve had enough of the disrespect and also I’m tired of seeing this type of management and display of power. I truly hope that this isn’t something that is honestly legally allowed just because she has signs up saying that if they don’t have a cap they’ll be thrown away. I just feel like that in itself shouldn’t even be allowed.

We got text after text about how disappointed they were in us not attending the holidays or getting SIL a Christmas gift. Then, they both resorted to the silent treatment of both of us. I decided for my husband's sake I would not block their numbers because his mom had plans to do our flowers for the wedding, and I wanted to ""keep the peace"" as much as possible before our wedding. Lesson learned a year later that this is not possible with narcissists.

We continued to be ignored at every single function by SIL (MIL eventually ""came around"" temporarily after an in person conversation that I facilitated), so by summertime we came to the decision we would no longer attend functions around the SIL (unfortunately, could not uninvite her to the wedding or my bridal shower at this point). She was a miserable witch at my bridal shower and wedding and would not acknowledge my husband and I at either event. Did a multitude of things at my bridal shower. Brought a broken coffee machine to our wedding to spite us - the machine spilled coffee everywhere so none of our guests could have any. It was truly despicable, and MIL made a comment that her daughter did it on purpose. I also know that MIL and SIL have bad mouthed me to other family members, making it extremely uncomfortable at these events.

MIL was incredibly angry that we did not do a religious wedding ceremony. We told her last year we were not using her church priest to officiate our ceremony. She made a comment after the wedding about it, then sent me 2 religious cards within a month of our wedding being over. Unfortunately, 3 weeks ago, I found out my mom has cancer at the time she started pushing her religion onto me. I asked DH to tell his mom and for her to keep this news private for the time being - I wanted HIM to tell her that the holidays would be spent with my family this year and that we didn't want to be around SIL. She went off the deep end and told the rest of their family the news after he asked her not to share. I was hoping this would get her off my husband's back and give us some grace for the holidays this year after last year's mess. I was wrong...again. She sent him more nasty messages after he confronted her about the religious cards/holidays and she has resorted back to the silent treatment. We had to see her at an event 2 weeks ago and it was like we both did not exist. As soon as there is a wedding, holiday, baby, someone else is sick, exciting event, etc, it instantly triggers them to be nasty.

DH has had some previous issues setting boundaries and making me the bad guy to his family. He has gotten better. Over the last year, I've been the one to try to initiate conversations with MIL/SIL over OUR wedding choices and have been disrespected and ignored time and time again. We have been ignored at every function, and any conversation to happen in person has been me talking because DH has said in the past he doesn't want to ""burn the bridge"" with his mom. I'd like to note that I'm in therapy and my husband has his own upcoming session. We have also decided to do MC. I ended up blocking the numbers of MIL/SIL and have gone NC as of 2 weeks ago. I can tell over the past few weeks my husband has tried his best to stand up to his mom and defend us, but I gave him a very clear ultimatum that his mother and sister will no longer be a part of our marriage.

This has absolutely torn me apart. I've been nothing but polite to my in laws, and my husband has let them disregard us both over and over again. Anytime they made passive aggressive remarks about my weight or my own family in the past, I've been the one to speak up. Anytime he tried to speak up to MIL/SIL (always via text) he ""stood up"" for me, got scared over their nasty response, and then we forgave their shitty behavior for the sake of our wedding. They would easily rope him back in with the offer of family gatherings and nice gifts, then would ignore us at said gatherings. NO MORE, I'm done with the mind games. I have been thinking about starting a family with him in the next few years and do not want my future child to have a relationship with these people. To make matters more complicated, DH works for his father and I'm so afraid if he goes full NC he will lose his job. It is a terrible situation that eats me alive everyday, on top of my mom's recent diagnosis. I'm fully aware there's no changing this. I've accepted it, but I'm having a very difficult time understanding why my husband tolerates their disgusting behavior. I'm really hoping therapy can help him and they do not continue to reel him back in now that I've gone NC and he is limiting his. I'm very afraid of their consequences once they realize I've blocked their numbers and do not attend any family functions. I know one day it will happen.",2,1732643411.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

1h0hwkz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h0hwkz,"Call me Neo, cause I be dodging bullets ","Some context here:

I’m just starting a divorce process after a fairly rocky marriage. So I decided I’d get on a dating app SOLEY for people to talk to and converse with. No intentions on hookups, dates, etc. and that’s stated pretty clearly in my profile and the people that message me.

 So this girl and I began talking. We talked for about a week or so before moving from the app to texting because messaging on that app was god awful. At one point she asks if I’m interested in getting coffee and I said sure, but later it was cancelled, no big deal at all. 

Here comes the interesting part, for more context, THIS WAS NOT INDENTED AS A DATE OF ANY KIND WHAT SO EVER (at least for me).
So I’m about to leave the house one day and I ask her if she wanted to grab that coffee, she says yes. When ever I leave I let her know. She asks where I wanted coffee at, I said “idk I figured we’d decide somewhere and then meet there”. Well apparently that wasn’t the right thing to say. 

She begins to slightly blow up a little on me. Calling me childish, inconsiderate, disrespectful, unorganized, etc. because I didn’t pre-plan this. Apparently she likes things pre-planned which I found strange because she was fine with going to get coffee with 30 minutes notice. Eventually I stop replying because all she was really doing was saying she wasn’t going to talk to me anymore and describing me in the terms above. I figured, hey no big deal, she doesn’t wanna talk anymore I get it. The next day, messages saying “maybe I did overrate a little…” 

Again, this wasn’t really all that big a deal to me. We talked about it for a little bit, then got off topic and started on other things. However, this morning, the coffee topic was brought up again… and this is what followed. ",22,1732643344.0,Nicegirls,19,0.82,False
1h0hwg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/1h0hwg2/you_bought_a_gunnow_what/,You bought a gun…now what?,"First off, love to see all the new gun owners joining the liberal 2A community. Even though it’s because our world is a scary place right now, it’s great to see more progressive people exercising their right to self defense, and getting into a great hobby.

After reading a bunch of posts over the past couple weeks though, I just wanted to put some thoughts out there for new gun owners.

1. **Shooting skills are perishable.** The training topic has been done to death, but it’s important to remember that like anything else, whatever skills you learn don’t last if you don’t practice them. Try doing 50 reps of dry fire (remember to ALWAYS clear the weapon and verify it’s safe first) once a week, aiming at a light switch or something. If you can afford it, try to get to the range once every month or two, even if it’s just to shoot 20 rounds.
2. **Work on your emotional maturity.** We all know guns aren’t toys. But now that you own a gun, it’s time to get really, really in the habit of regularly checking in with your emotions. Are you feeling angry? Infuriated by the news? Depressed? Hopeless? Be real about recognizing that, and deciding to leave the gun in the safe. It’s also good to get in the practice of practicing inner calm, working on internally emotionally de-escalating your reactions to threats or arguments, taking a few deep breathes before reacting, and dialing down your startle response. You gave up the right to be reactive and angry when you bought a gun. 
3. **Think about hitting the gym.** Since the gun is a last resort, make sure all other options to respond to physical threats are on the table. With a judiciary shifting increasingly right, you better believe your politics might come into play against you if you have to engage in a defensive shooting. Are you able to push a 200 lbs. 3%’er away if he comes at you? Do you have the stamina to run from an attacker until you reach somewhere safe? If you’re physically able, even just doing some brisk walks and a few pushups a couple times a week can dramatically improve your physical abilities, and will also help you mentally feel better too.
4. **Have fun**. Don’t make your relationship with guns all about doom, gloom and fear. There’s a lot of fun to be had at the range. There can be a meditative zen to shooting, especially at distance. It forces mindfulness, since you have to focus completely on the task at hand, push away distractions, control your breathing, try and slow your heart rate, relax your body, watch what the wind is doing in the grass and the trees, listen to the shifts in air current. For me, those are beautiful moments where I am fully present in the here and now, with a sense of peace we rarely find in the modern world. Shooting is a hobby that you can always improve, but never perfect. And, it’s a sh\*\*load of fun. 
5. **Find your community.** Guns don’t have to be your new personality trait, but you’d be surprised how many people you already know who actually shoot too, they just keep it low key. I’ve made a lot of friends or gotten to know acquaintances better by casually mentioning I like to shoot as a hobby, and it turns out this person at the coffee shop does too. There’s more like-minded people out there to connect with than you might imagine.

Same goes with energy drinks, I was reading that the extra vitamins added to the drink aren’t deemed as safe. However, I’ve seen people online who are BF drinking energy drinks. 

Is it safe to have drinks with artificial sweeteners and vitamins added to it like the zevia pop, energy drinks,etc? Does anyone on here drink them without issue?

1h0hw6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultautism/comments/1h0hw6q/need_some_help_to_understand_my_dad/,Need some help to understand my dad. ,"My extremely apologies for this long a post. I am a 38F NT child of an undiagnosed Autistic Dad(70). Writing this here and seeking some help to understand my father. All of my life, I have always known him to be a soft , extremely hardworking father who was into books. He was most often stationed at different cities because of his work, but he left me with my mother(66) growing up (And she is likely an undiagnosed Narc parent) For the longest, I grew up thinking I had so much to heal from a toxic mother, but in light of some experiences with my dad in recent times

To begin, all through childhood, I ve only known him to be an extremely soft person, in comparison to my more loud, dominating mother. He worked super hard, to ensure she had a lifestyle far from where these two came from. They come from very humble, poor beginnings. She on the other hand would constantly berate him for never being man enough. Money was never enough for her, and he was a stingy man who wouldnt waste a penny. He would always give up his salary so my mother or I could spend instead.

All of the things that I can recall of him, growing up.

1. He was an attentive dad to the extent that he would ensure he provided for me and my mother. I recall going to parks with him, but i recall him being a passive dad. I do not recollect a lot of conversations with him
2. I saw him tinkering a lot of machines around us. Be it our car, or the mixer/grinder, etc. He always would end up buying an extremely used old car, that would breakdown and it seemed he loved to sit and work the machine, constantly changing or charging the batteries, and other things. He also recently acquired a bike that was age old, rusted and not in a working condition, because he thought he could use it to exercise his arms, by pushing the bike two and fro
3. He has been an avid reader all his life and has hoarded books that he believed he wants to read in the future.
4. He got a degree in law, part time while I was doing my undergraduate, hoping to practise at some point in the future. He had worked all his life as a banker and so when he retired he began practising law, however in the last few years, he has read a lot of books, to claim intellectual superiority, but he has never been successful in bringing an actual client on his own. (Since he worked as an associate for a few lawyers, he used to be called upon to appear at court). His opinion on others on the scene, be it fellow lawyers or judges that have presided over his cases, always appear to me as condescending to me, because he belittles them for their lack of knowledge. He is super condescending to his few clients that might have come to him, only because he appeared for him through other lawyers that put him on the case, or probably because he charges extremely low fees (He receives his pensions and so he does not really need to be the lawyer to make money for himself).

Now for all of the other parts

5. He has been a hoarder. (It feels like we have trash room in my parents home). He would go through garbage to see if there is anything important to hold back, that might serve him as use at a later time. In recent times, when i tried to get the room cleaned, he got triggered into a childish , angry temper tantrum, that I got mad at him. (I have to admit, I did abuse him with harshest words, that I absolutely feel shitty about throwing at him).

6. I really do not think, he gets any conversation from another person. It only feels to me like he can never make sense of complexities in the conversation. I personally find him absolutely poor on EQ or Social cues. And just getting any point across is so hard, unless I logically manoeuvre my side of the conversation with him.  I have seen my mother be so angry at him, and he seems to be of mental construct, some rule of sort, that as a wife, it is her duty to love him, cook for him and though my mother does all of this begrudingly, and I know she is not doing anything in that manner of affection, he does not seem to get it at all. For some recent conversation with some neighbours, he claimed they were belittling him, yet he felt there was no need to actually give me the full context of the conversation, because it was not important to rule out this assumption. To be honest all my life as an adult, I have always known him to be a man of assumptions.

7. His constant rant is that the world is to be blamed for his helplessness. His wife for all of the things he didn't achieve, the world of lawyers in the real world are too dishonest for someone like him to become big. I do feel he never does keep his word on anything. Of course considering his age, I do not expect anything much from him, but he has a problem making a proactive approach. He has grand plans all the time, and can talk a lot about how he is waiting to make the next move, but his reasoning is so flawed because of his lack of understanding the social game one has to play to survive the world. I used to hate his constant victim attitude, but now I wonder, if the way he looks at the world, is perhaps because there has not been much help to really understand him from his POV

8. He has a strict strict morning ritual, that if not taken up, he will claim his body does not work well. He has constantly been going to different health camps for check ups. Now these are hospital discounts for a health checkup offered as marketing to get more patients, and though he seems to have nothing ailing him at all and has a very good profile of health otherwise for people of his age. Yet there seems to be some hypochondriac in him, that just does not stop checking his own vitality. Neither would he follow any doctors' advice, because he feels they aren't expert enough. (This seems paradoxical for me, to be honest)

9. He wears clothes that absolutely look raggedly, and are probably super old and unless my mother and I force him to dress up, he wouldn't budge.

10. He does not have friends. He believes the world is not trustworthy enough and only blood relatives are to be truly trusted. (Several of our relatives have not treated him well, and yet he not would see that.) He is always undermining the house help or at times, even when I hear him speak, his words mirror condescension. Although he claims that not to be the case.

11. I have to parrot my instructions at times so many times. I know my mother just hates the sight of him, yet he would annoyingly come into the kitchen, and move things in specific manner (Say he wants a coffee, he would only use the stove, with a specific small vessel, and measure and mix in a specific manner, etc. ) that annoys the shit out of her and have her scream at him.

Growing up with him and my narcissist mother, for the longest time, it felt that I had to adult sooner and even when I was a child. While my longest challenge had been to deal with my mother, I do realize in recent years my dad has left me frustrated and triggered. I do not believe it would be any easy task to diagnose if he indeed is on the spectrum, but this might help me be more compassionate and kind to understand his challenges. I hope any of you in the forum can help me , have a thought about this.

Thanks a bunch! Sorry this was a long read, but I couldnt but not add all of this to get some picture..of who my dad is.",1,1732643320.0,adultautism,0,1.0,False

Bridging Sustainability and Innovation: NEXE and Bridgehead Collaborate to Revolutionize the Coffee Industry

In a groundbreaking move that aligns sustainability with innovation, NEXE Innovations Inc. (TSXV: NEXE) has announced a strategic partnership with Bridgehead Coffee, a Canadian coffee pioneer known for its commitment to Fairtrade and environmentally friendly practices. This collaboration highlights both companies' commitment to the growing single-serve coffee market, emphasizing compostable solutions that appeal to eco-conscious consumers.

# About NEXE Innovations: Pioneers in Compostable Materials

NEXE Innovations is revolutionizing packaging with its proprietary, patented compostable material. The flagship product, the NEXE Pod, is BPI-certified and designed to withstand the rigors of coffee brewing, including heat, pressure, and water.

Operating from a vertically integrated facility in North America, NEXE maintains full control over production, ensuring consistent quality and sustainability across its offerings.

# Bridgehead Coffee: A Legacy of Sustainability

Founded over 40 years ago, Bridgehead Coffee has been a trailblazer in the Canadian coffee scene. It was one of the first coffeehouses in Canada to serve Fairtrade coffee, emphasizing ethical sourcing and environmental stewardship.

With 17 coffeehouses across Ontario and partnerships with major retailers like Costco, Whole Foods Market, Sobey's, and Farm Boy, Bridgehead is a significant player in the coffee market. Its online store extends its reach, offering premium products to customers nationwide.

# The Shift to NEXE Pods

Previously, Bridgehead offered compostable soft-bottom coffee pods. However, the transition to NEXE's BPI-certified compostable pods marks a significant upgrade. These pods not only align with Bridgehead’s sustainability goals but also enhance convenience and quality for consumers.

The initial delivery includes two signature blends: Centro House and Bytown Boom. These blends, also available in bagged coffee form, reflect Bridgehead's commitment to premium taste and environmental consciousness.

Ash Guglani, President of NEXE Innovations, highlighted the potential of this partnership:

*""The teams are working closely to build a successful long-term partnership and create a more sustainable future in the North American coffee industry.""* Both companies share a vision of reducing waste in the single-serve coffee market, which has historically relied on plastic pods with significant environmental impact.

# Bridgehead's New Ownership: A Fresh Start

In early 2024, Bridgehead Coffee transitioned from Aegis Brands to the Pilot Coffee Group, a company known for its dedication to quality and sustainability. This change signifies a renewed focus on expanding Bridgehead's reach and impact. Under Aegis, Bridgehead reported $16.4 million in sales for 2023. With its new leadership and innovative collaborations like this one, the brand is poised for further growth.

# The Future of Sustainable Coffee

As awareness of environmental issues grows, consumers are increasingly seeking out products that align with their values. Compostable coffee pods are a practical and impactful way to reduce waste. The NEXE-Bridgehead partnership sets a precedent for other companies in the coffee industry, demonstrating that sustainability and profitability can go hand in hand.

The NEXE Pod’s BPI certification guarantees it meets rigorous compostability standards, ensuring it breaks down in industrial composting facilities without leaving harmful residues. Designed to fit most coffee brewing machines, the pods offer convenience without compromising on sustainability.

This collaboration highlights the importance of adopting innovative materials in reducing environmental footprints. It is a step forward for both brands in leading the charge toward a more sustainable future. Customers benefit from the high-quality coffee they love, now packaged in an eco-friendly way that supports their values.

On the second night without power, I decided to take my family to my office building, which thankfully still had electricity. Our company was kind enough to accommodate all of us ""refugees"" from the outage.

We settled into one of the meeting rooms, and I hooked up my laptop to the TV to watch a show with my wife. The TV was mounted on the wall, but the sound was coming from my laptop, which was sitting on a knee-level coffee table by the sofa—not even centered with the TV. It was a far cry from my home theater setup, but we made do.

As we got into the show, we became so immersed in the plot that I could swear the sound was coming from the TV. I asked my wife, and she felt the same way. I even double-checked to confirm that the TV was indeed silent. When I focused on the laptop, the sound was clearly coming from it. But as soon as I got back into the show, the sound seemed to ""move"" and ""stick"" to the TV.

1h0hnlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h0hnlw/is_marax_the_only_choice_in_my_case_1200/,Is MaraX the only choice in my case? [1200€],"Hi all,

  
I had Profitec GO for some time but returned it because of QC issues with Profitec. I realized it was not the best choice, I make mostly milk drinks, two in the morning and two in the afternoon, and waiting for steam with a single boiler was annoying. I want to increase my budget a little bit to get something better. After long research, I came to the conclusion that the MaraX is the only way. I know prices differ, so I'll write how this looks in my country:

  
I bought Profitec GO for 765 euro

MaraX is for 1160 euro

When it comes to espresso and milk steaming right after in this budget (lets say 1200 euro) MaraX seems to be the only way, I was thinking about Ascaso DUO but here it is 500 euros more than MaraX. There is no way to get any reasonable dual boiler in the price of MaraX.

The only downside of MaraX is warm-up time. I am never in a rush in the morning, I have all the time to make coffee at home but sometimes I get a random need for a coffee and 25 minutes of wait time is quite long. I know this is the case with most HX machines.

Do you have any other recommendations that I might have overlooked?",2,1732642747.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1h0hm2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1h0hm2p/costa_rica_trip_report_2_weeks_in_november/,Costa Rica Trip Report - 2 weeks in November ,"We took a 2 week trip to Costa Rica in November 2024. 

We spent one week in La Fortuna/Manuel Antonio and one week in Drake Bay.

**Arrival in San Jose:**
I heard airport taxis were expensive, and  Uber is technically illegal, so I was determined to take the local bus to San Jose city centre. Looking back, Uber is probably the easier option, you just have to call it from up the road.

You will need small notes in the local currency for this bus. When you depart the airport there are no ATMs, you have to go back into the departures terminal (I believe there are ATMs in baggage claim, but we missed these). In departures, there's a BAC bank & ATM. My Monzo card worked fine, I withdrew 120,000 colones and asked if the bank could change a 20,000 note into smaller notes, which they were happy to do. You then have to walk to the bus stop on the other side of the car park in front of the terminal and wait for a bus into San Jose. They arrive every 15 minutes or so. It was hot, slow, crowded and we had to stand the entire journey (45 mins). But it cost only 735 colones (less than $2). Stay until the end of the line, San Jose's main bus terminal, then walk/Uber to your accomodation.

**Internet:**
Our esim from Airalo had great coverage throughout our trip - we had better signal in remote villages than I have in some areas of London!

**Money:**
We needed cash for public transport, payment for some accomodation and for everything else when we lost power Drake Bay. I can see why people say cash isn't needed, as most places accept card, but I would advise withdrawing some backup cash from an ATM, especially if you're buying bus tickets or travelling to Drake Bay. I've read that the Bank of Costa Rica (BCR) doesn't charge to withdraw cash, but unfortunately this bank's ATM didn't accept our Monzo cards.

**Transport:**
We used shared shuttles to get from San Jose to La Fortuna, and then La Fortuna to Manuel Antonio, as it seemed like this was the quickest option without a car. We used [Interbus](https://www.interbusonline.com/). Tickets are pricey ($60 pp), but it worked wonderfully: door-to-door service, aircon, wifi, rest stops. For the other legs we used [Tracopa](https://www.tracopacr.com/) coaches, which were much cheaper. You pay in cash at ticket office or buy online by downloading their app, Passer, which also proved useful for travel/route disruption notifications. There was a lot of waiting around at bus stations for the coach to show up, but the coaches themselves are comfortable. We used a mixture of Uber, taxis and local buses to get around once at our destination.

**La Fortuna:**
Uber worked really well for us here, we used it multiple times a day, and didn't have a problem getting to/from all the main sights. The tourist shuttle (EasyHop) wasn't operating at that time so we relied on Ubers, which are much cheaper than the official red taxis. 

Go early to Mistico Hanging Bridges, we had it to ourselves at 6:30am.

For our Arenal Volcano hike We chose Mirador El Silencio ($10pp). There weren't many people and it felt more wild than Mistico.

Sloth's Territory is a short drive from the town. Our guide was lovely and you sense they have a lot of respect for the wildlife. We saw a number of sloths and picked up tips on how to spot them ourselves.

We also visited El Choyin (free hot springs/river), which was lovely. Again, go early to avoid crowds (that's the theme for this trip!). However, we did have to walk up the road to Tabacan resort to get signal for the Uber back! 

Lastly we went out to El Bosque de Tío Victor for another hike the rainforest ($10pp). It was awesome, we had the trail to ourselves and a dog companion. Bring swimwear, you'll likely have a private waterfall experience here. We did have to catch a red taxi back to La Fortuna this time because we were too far out to call an Uber.

**Manuel Antonio/Quepos:**
There are less Uber drivers available here, so we made good use of the local bus running between Quepos & the national park. Ask locals where to wait for the bus. 

Again, go early to the national park. We booked the earliest time slot and there were still a significant amount of people. You can quickly lose them once you're on the trails. We didn't bother with a guide because we thought we had a Corcovado tour ahead of us (more on that later!), we still saw plenty of wildlife. Just look out for falling leaves (a sure sign of something above you), keep quiet and listen for rustling.

For our second day in MA/Quepos we watched baby turtles being released at [Tortugas de isla Damas](https://m.facebook.com/tortugasdeisladamas/). This was possibly the highlight of our entire trip. You need to send a WhatsApp to the guy in charge, Milo, to ask if there's a release happening the next day, then you get a short ferry over to El Cocal and ask someone to drive you there (5k colones). The drive along the beach was super fun. The turtles are adorable. The project of monitoring/hatching/releasing them is admirable. Suggested donation of $20pp. 

**Drake Bay/Corcovado:**
Weather up until this point was great, mainly dry with sporadic showers. Unfortunately our luck ran out the day we travelled to Drake Bay. There was a tropical storm hitting the country. It rained almost non-stop for a week, all our tours and activities were cancelled and we lost power for two days. This was highly unusual even for November, so don't let it put you off travelling at this time of year. We were unlucky. 

The 11:30 Tracopa coach from Quepos runs all the way to Sierpe, where you catch the 4pm boat to Drake Bay. The coach drops you next to the dock, and I get the impression they wait for this coach before launching the boat, so don't worry if you're running late. If the weather is bad prepare for a bumpy ride, but it's an amazing experience and we saw crocodiles!

The Drake Bay trail to Playa San Josecito was a good substitute for Corcovado national park. Really nice walk through dense forest, across hanging bridges and beaches.

Check out Cafe del Mar For local coffee. Lovely guy running the place out of his house. I can wholly recommend Pacheco Tours and Casa El Tortugo for accomodation. They took good care of us during the storm.

It's a testament to how great Drake Bay is that even though the park was closed, we saw loads of wildlife in and around the village, and really enjoyed our time there. We got the boat back to Sierpe, a short shuttle ride up to Palmar Norte and then a Tracopa coach back to San Jose (they run fairly regularly from Palmar Norte).

**San Jose:**
Due to bad weather we spent more time in San Jose than planned. Shout out to Rafa's Bar (great local bar). We LOVED the central market, ate here multiple times and bought all our souvenirs here. The Municipal Crafts Market is arguably even better for souvenirs, but we found this out too late!

""we'll go to this coffee shop, get this desert that's really good"" and yada yada. Once again i refused and he continues to prod me, messaging me whether i'm still mad at him or not and is basically begging me to be friends with him.

To me this is especially confusing, considering he is the one that broke things off between us romantically, and prior to our break up was super distant, and now he wants to be all in my face.

Because of this, I believe he probably just wants to continue our sexual relationship, and he hopes that by bothering me l will eventually give in.

Now- it most likely are coffee beans or any other kind of beans. The washing machine was filled by a friend who has helped me with My chores before- and she must have accidentally included my little owl which was filled with seeds. Now it's empty of course XD. 

I'm in the progress of cleaning those seeds out of the washing machine. At the moment I'm letting them dry a bit so I can vacuum the mass and then clean the rest with my hands. I will also check the filter and so on, and I'm hoping those seeds did not go into the washing machine further, I can't afford to buy a new one.

A week after the breakup, we met up to exchange some belongings. The interaction felt just like old times—it was fun, comfortable, and we even ended up being intimate with each other. After that, I decided to go fully No Contact.

For a few weeks, I managed to stick to No Contact, but last weekend, I broke it in a drunken moment at 5:00 AM and called her (I know, I know…). To my surprise, she picked up, and we had a really good conversation. In the call she told me she still loves me (she didn’t drink). The next day, I texted her, and we had another nice chat through messages.

Yesterday, I asked her if she’d like to grab a coffee sometime. She agreed and suggested coming over to my place, but I proposed meeting in the city to avoid the possibility of us becoming intimate again, as I felt that might complicate things. She initially saw this as me viewing the meetup as a “date” and responded with this message:

“But love, now it sounds like a date, and I’d like to catch up and hand over the last of your things. But I also don’t want to give you false hope.”

I told her I don’t have any hope and that we’re just going to talk (have fun talk -not too indept about the break-up). She respected that, and we agreed to meet for coffee in the city.

I’ve watched 1,000 videos about No Contact, and it feels stupid to have ruined it like this while drunk. But honestly, I was happy we had a good conversation and that we’re now meeting up again. Still, her message today shook me. It feels like all the progress I made during No Contact might have been for nothing.

My gut tells me that Sunday will go well, and that we will have fun, and that this is just her defense mechanism kicking in and wants to stay in control because she is still not sure how she will feel when she sees me.

For anyone who might say, “Why would you even want her back?”—I get it. But the truth is, I still feel confused about the current situation and i felt that I didn’t make any process in the last 2 weeks. Things don’t feel resolved, especially because our relationship ended so abruptly, and the last time we saw each other, we had such a good time together. So for my own mental health its better to have some clarity.

I’d really love to hear your thoughts:
	• How do you interpret her message? Is this truly the end, or is it just part of typical Fearful Avoidant patterns and I just should take it easy? Could it mean less than it seems? 
	• How should I approach this meeting? What can I do to keep it positive and productive without creating too many expectations?
	• Does anyone have experience dealing with a Fearful Avoidant partner after a breakup? What worked for you in maintaining or rebuilding a connection?

She’s one of the boss’s favorites, so whenever she vented to him about something, he would take action to relieve her stress. Early on, I got written up for not retaining enough information. The thing is, she didn’t really sit down to properly train me—I had to ask her questions, and sometimes she’d jump in to help without me asking, but it wasn’t consistent. Right before I got written up, I noticed her pacing around and looking worried, so I suspect she complained to the boss about me.

Over time, I realized she was using me to promote herself. When I needed help, she’d sometimes make me look incompetent rather than genuinely assisting me. Because of this, I started keeping my distance and asking other coworkers for help. This approach worked, and I eventually improved at my job and passed my 120-day probation period.

One coworker, in particular, was very helpful and supportive—she’s actually the reason I got this job in the first place. We get along well and even hang out outside of work (lunches, coffee, etc.). However, I later found out that she and the coworker who trained me don’t get along. They approach work differently, and there’s some tension between them. For me, though, the supportive coworker has always had my back.

Here’s where things get strange: I was out sick last week, and the coworker who trained me approached my cousin (who works in a different department) to tell him that she thought I was mad at her, that she wished me well, and that she thought this job was a good fit for me. She also said she didn’t have anything against me. My cousin was confused about why she was telling him this and told me what happened.

I explained to my cousin that this coworker had made negative reports about me to our boss and didn’t have my back when I needed her during training. I don’t trust her because, in my experience, she acts in her own best interest and isn’t genuinely helpful. I’ve kept things professional—I say hi to her, even though she usually ignores me unless I’m talking to others first. Her behavior is inconsistent, and I can’t read her intentions, but I feel like I need to stay cautious around her.

What do you think her intentions are? How should I handle this situation moving forward?",2,1732641564.0,OfficePolitics,0,1.0,False

1h0h5ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ILoveBocchi/comments/1h0h5ud/my_first_story_about_my_fiction_character/,My first story about my fiction character !,"On a quiet night on Elizabeth Street, Luis Carson, 17, studied alone to prepare for the medical exam. Carson, nicknamed ""Isanus"" because of his superhuman intelligence (early speaking, early literacy, understanding of mathematics and literature since childhood), possessed a warm voice and handsome face since childhood. Having lost his father at a young age and his mother being terminally ill, Carson studied while working to earn money to treat her and pay for her tuition. After graduating from high school, Carson passed college, achieved excellent results, and worked part-time at a coffee shop near the school. Because he is a good student who is almost at the top of the school's score, he is often sent by his teachers to the Institute of Medicine every Saturday and Sunday to research more about the practices there. At the institute, he studied very hard and acquired knowledge from his seniors, being assisted in many surgeries. He is also sociable and friendly with everyone, so everyone appreciates and trusts him. Briefly four years after he had just turned 21, passed the valedictorian examination of the school, and he continued his studies in master's degree to obtain a degree from the Department. After 3 years at the Institute, he had a master's degree to transfer to the Department of Research on sample methods there. There, the working environment is very strict because it is the headquarters of the government, so it took him quite a bit of time to integrate with people and the working environment. He works at the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, where he will be experimented with developing a number of drugs for plants and humans. His life is just about doing, doing and doing experiments. But just one day he was invited to study a virus sample from Antarctica. Even though it's subjective, you only need to do the research. Everyone stopped it, but even though there were experts, they didn't dare to interfere. But who would have thought that just because of a mistake, he was infected with the virus. He did not expect how dangerous and contagious this virus was to humans. That virus made him feel deformed, his brain was purified by chemicals, causing him to gradually lose consciousness; he felt like his genes were changed. His body gradually transformed. His flesh gradually melted, replacing it with a new type of skin with red and gray mucus. His legs gradually grew larger and full of tendons there; The ankle grew a horrifying-looking eye. His neck suddenly grew longer, his body became larger than usual. His head gradually revealed a skull with red eyes covering the entire head with that mucus. His back grew long, wriggling horns. Even though the other virus controlled all of his body, it still kept the rest of Carson's brain. That means Carson is still a little aware, but now you will be a version of a terrifying, cruel entity with a sharp human brain. When the transformation was over, Carson screamed in a terrifying way that caught the attention of everyone in the area. He walked out of the room, holding a bone scythe in his hand and the slime killed everyone working in that area for 1 minute. Carson walked out covered in blood around him, feeling things life around him, he began to find people to hunt to satisfy his craving for blood. Thanks to his big legs and large body, in just 5 seconds, he slaughtered everyone at breakneck speed in the area near him with a bone scythe he created. He absorbs life force by swallowing the whole person with his back behind him. That horny back suddenly became terrible teeth that devoured delicious corpses. The more people he kills, the bigger he becomes and gains more power. The more you get, the more brutally you kill people there at such a terrible speed that the press doesn't have time to report on that reality. In just 2 minutes he killed a country and he became bigger and bigger. Now his body is bigger than many mountains and now he can blow away many big cities or other mountains. And after just 5 minutes, he destroyed the entire world, destroyed the entire civilization. You kill everyone. When you meet someone, you kill them, do not forgive them, and move at a terrifyingly fast speed, causing the whole world to perish. In the blink of an eye, several countries will be almost destroyed. Now he can hold the Earth with just two hands and has absolute power. He changed his name to “Ulquiora”.

Have read that people can experience mild weight loss on it (I’m sure nothing close to the injectable) and hope that’ll be the case for me.

I am taking 3mg sublingually first thing in the morning. I already cancelled my next month prescription but if it ends up working maybe I’ll continue.

Day 1 (175.4 lbs)
- Took an antacid at the same time as the tirz wondering if it could help with the absorption
- Reduced hunger and food noise in morning, had some coffee
- Diarrhea all morning
- Got very hungry at lunch and ate a reasonably sized lunch and felt extremely full after. I would normally be snacking after eating that portion but I had no interest and was fine till dinner.
- Drank a few beers (I had social plans, obv not ideal)
- Had dinner and ate a reasonable portion even though I had been drinking (usually drunchies are a downfall of mine). Finished my whole plate at dinner.

Day 2 (173.9 lbs)
- Did not take the antacid, feel like it is a noticeable difference and I feel like my mouth is very acidic since taking it
- Skipped coffee today, still had some diarrhea
- No food yet, I’m a bit hungry but able to keep the food noise away. I’ll wait till lunch time to eat.

So far I can’t conclude that it’s working but I need more time. I did drop 1.5 lbs but could easily be for other reasons, I didn’t undereat that significantly yesterday especially with the alcohol calories.

I wanted to document my experience because I have seen a lot of people asking about it and since I’m already sucked in for this month I hope I can help someone else.

1h0gw08,https://www.reddit.com/r/luxurycandles/comments/1h0gw08/help_saving_my_ds_durga_candle/,Help Saving My DS & Durga Candle,"Hi all,

So I recently bought Breakfast Leipzig by DS & Durga, which is as good as advertised (seems to be one of their more popular candles in this sub).

The first day I lit it, my entire *house* smelled like a European coffee shop. I ran it under a warmer for a few hours, then turned it off to go run some errands. When I got in my car, I could smell it on me. When I came back, there were still some faint traces of it in the air. I was beyond excited and surprised at the throw, and just assumed it would be like that every time I burned it.

Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. 

Every subsequent time I've used it, the smell has gotten fainter.

After doing some research on warming techniques, I think I ran the lamp too high for too long initially, when the recommendation is to give it a slow burn. You're also supposed to physically remove some of the melted wax, since it's not gonna evaporate naturally like it would with an actual burn. 

The past three times I've used it, I've done an actual burn, to get rid of the excess wax on top that's lost the oil, but it hasn't made a difference. I still have to lean into the candle to get any semblance of the scent that once was.

Is there any way to save this? Should I go back to the warmer but leave the lamp at a medium or low setting? Would really love to recapture the scent, especially now with people coming over for the holidays.",5,1732640878.0,luxurycandles,1,1.0,False

1h0guc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1h0guc7/eli5_can_someone_explain_degassing_in_coffee_like/,ELI5: Can someone explain degassing in coffee like I am 5?,"If anyone wants to skip the rant there's a TLDR.

I've been trying to understand what degassing essentially means- I currently have a manual grinder (C2) and buy whole beans. My palette so far has been BT \[Vienna Roast, Silver Oak, Attikan Estate\] and a couple of medium-darks from Marc's Coffee. My daily driver is a V60. Rookie mistake- I very recently realised light roasts are better suited for pour overs when you really wanna taste the note :3

I bought Ratnagiri RM1 - 76 hours yeast fermentation \[specifically purchased the one with intense notes\] to actually experience the whole deal around tasting notes. If you have come this far- can somebody (again) explain how the whole tasting process works? Do I wait for the coffee to cool down a little bit? Does the taste flare up like an aftertaste or does it come up right when I take the first sip? Sorry about drifting away from the pain question:

\[TLDR begins here\] How long do I wait for the coffee (particularly a light roast- whole bean) but a general answer would also be appreciated) to degas or is degas even required?",2,1732640760.0,IndiaCoffee,6,0.75,False

Looking for a simple breakfast idea for Thanksgiving morning to feed your house guests? - I always make a batch of muffins in advance, pop them in the freezer, thaw them overnight, and warm up in the oven when guests are in town.

Here is the recipe for my Banana Pumpkin Muffins:https://www.pineandpalmkitchen.com/banana-and-pumpkin-muffins/

Other simple breakfast ideas- 

Yogurt bar- set out plain greek yogurt, granola, berries, and nuts

Croissant tray- place jars of jam, ham, swiss cheese, and croissants out for your guests. 

Coffee- assign one guest to be in charge of the coffee. Make certain you have plenty of creamer and types of sweeteners.

Maybe if it was a hike or even rock climbing or some activity like that. But a gym sesh?

I mentioned I really like exercise, but I wasn’t implying that as a date! 

Should I think this through and give it a fun spin or suggest something else? I just feel a tab bit awkward turning down his idea.

1h0gmg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLE/comments/1h0gmg9/cpslaw_investigation_polygraph_question/,CPS/Law Investigation - Polygraph Question,"Quick background- my stepson called CPS on me about 3 and a half weeks ago with a serious allegation.  The allegation is 100% false - I know it, my wife knows it, our family knows it, etc.  It was done purely out of spite and being brainwashed by their biological father for years and years.  I won't dive deep into this, but thats the general background.

I immediately called my lawyer to retain him here, as these are waters I've never had to navigate.  I have nothing on my record, completely clean A to Z.  I have a terrific career in medicine (I treat pediatrics on a daily basis) and do very well for myself.  I've seen a therapist for years for anxiety and just life stresses.  My wife and I also have a son between the two of us.  She has three total children from a previous marriage (2 girls, 1 boy). The boy is the one that called into CPS.  He is 17 and he created an allegation from 7 years ago.

The detective assigned to the case asked my lawyer for a polygraph.  I have NEVER had to take one, am not familiar with them other than my Google researching.

What should I expect here? I am freaking the F out over the thought of having to take a polygraph.  I understand they are not admissable in the court of PA and have a margin of error, which is FREAKING me out. I have nothing to hide here, but I have a very analytical, anxiety ridden mind.  I get anxiety over ordering a coffee at a cafe.

Any advice, tips, or guidance on how to navigate this?  Any and all help is appreciated.  Please no bashing or assuming things here.",2,1732640240.0,AskLE,8,1.0,False

My goal is bettering myself not only for my kid but also to be a better financial partner for my partner, we are not married and I will not have him be financially responsible for my debts, he's otherwise extremely supportive and I don't think knows the extent of debt.

I'm not sure I'm looking for tough love, encouragement, or community to help hold accountability. I know my situation isn't nearly as bad as others, but with my current situation I can be doing a lot better.

All amounts are estimated, I feel like I am in a game of catch up on financial literacy. I have been watching a lot of financial audit and alexonabudget (I use her spending tracker as of oct) and they have been really helping me change my financial mindset.

If it comes to it- I do have the option of picking up weekend shifts +/- holidays, it's just not required of me due to my position. I'm a state employee to a non-profit. They have a retirement system of the state, it's auto-pulled and I'll be considered vested in 2027; I'm hoping once finances are more in order to also invest more in the 403b they offer.

Debt Min Payments: $918.00

By my math I'm -$271.41 each month. I know my ""little treats"" is the big problem and since starting tracking, I have improved on dining out less and less coffee runs. The tracking sheet has really helped improve my self control and continuing to lurk here and watch others has helped keep me focus. I want to also eventually encourage others.

I've seen ideas of paying the biggest balance/interest first and I've seen ideas of paying the smallest balance/interest when it comes to debt repayment. As of right now I feel my lowest interest has the highest balance (truck) and my lowest balance has the highest interest (AmEx.) .

I did have AmEx(both cards) paid off, but then got into a car accident and luckily only had to pay the deductible, now I transfer $600 into the bank account where my truck payments come from and the extra stays in that separate account for a started emergency fund (should I do it as extra debt repayment?) recover that deductible without having to put it on a card if something like that happens again.

Be tough, but kind. haha. Thank you all.

1h0glgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesfromtheDogHouse/comments/1h0glgf/boyfriends_dogs_are_a_nightmare_and_making_me/,Boyfriend’s dogs are a nightmare and making me miserable,"This is going to be a long post but my quality of life is horrible right now. I want to begin by saying I am very in love with my boyfriend. He’s a wonderful man who is very empathetic and supportive and I am overall very happy in my relationship with him outside of this one issue. I love him dearly and feel guilty even talking about what I’m about to discuss. The problem is that he owns two large mixed breed black labs, one of which is a pitbull mix, and they are a nightmare. He loves them to death despite this. I’m starting to resent them deeply and I’m worried it will impact my boyfriend and I’s relationship as it’s already impacting our intimacy. 

These dogs are extremely high energy, destructive, untrained, and all around have an insane amount of behavioral issues. He has two baby gates that initially kept them downstairs and away from me when needed, but his female dog has figured out how to open both gates and will let the other dog through as well, so now there is literally nothing separating them from us—ever, regardless of what we are doing, even when we are literally having sex because my boyfriend refuses to close the bedroom door. Which is becoming a problem, because being around these dogs is INTENSE. I don’t know where to even begin, so I’ll start with the dog of his I’m actually afraid of.

The pitbull mix has resource guarding issues, a bite history and regularly exhibits aggressive and territorial behavior towards me. He is INSANELY jealous and high maintenance and hates when I interact with my boyfriend in any capacity. I am “nipped” by him at least 4-5 times every time I visit now, but this dog has a massive head, jaws, and teeth. In addition to the nipping, any time he’s around me, he’s literally gnawing on my arm until I’m covered in bruises and red marks and saliva and he’s broken skin on multiple occasions. When he’s not biting me, he’s charging at me and jumping up into the air beside me until he’s level with my head while gnashing his teeth so intensely that there are audible chomping noises. He’s so aggressive that someone actually once shot him with a gun when he escaped my boyfriend’s yard—I suspect because he attacked, as he has in the past.

This dog is terrifying. I am legitimately tense whenever he’s around me. The dog hates when I interact with my boyfriend in any capacity. If I even caress or look at/talk to my boyfriend when he’s in the room, he’ll lunge at me, get directly in my face and let out this terrible high pitched barking and yelping that devolves into this horrible whining noise that sounds like he’s screaming. Then, he’ll climb completely on top of me (he’s ~90 pounds), put all of his weight on my body, and attempt to wedge himself between my boyfriend and I while scratching me with his claws until I’ve been completely pushed out of the space due to how strong and large he is—all the while keeping his face millimeters from mine and giving me this look that could kill. When I get off the bed and come back, he “guards” the bed from me, gnashes his teeth and paces back and forth to try to block me from getting in it with my boyfriend. It usually takes me 5-10 minutes to even get into my boyfriend’s bed for this reason. If I get up to go anywhere, he chases after me and tries to bite me and the whole process starts all over again.

When we’re intimate and he’s in the room, it’s even worse. He will whine and scream and physically force himself between us during sex. He’ll even lay his head down on my abdomen and stare intensely at my nether region while whining and yelping and licking his lips (🤢) when my boyfriend is fucking going down on me. Also doing typical gross dog stuff the whole time, like repeatedly trying to shove his nose in my crotch/butt and my boyfriend’s crotch/butt, lick me in areas I do NOT want to be licked, etc. Inching closer and closer the entire time until this dog is, no joke, lying with his whole body directly on top of my NAKED body and it’s practically impossible to push him off. Eventually it gets to be so much that my boyfriend will have to try to force him out of the room, which usually lasts 15-20 minutes as this dog runs around the bed, dodges my boyfriend, drops all of his weight/goes limp so he’s impossible to move, hides behind me/pillows/etc. Just nonstop antics and fighting with everything in him to not be removed from the room. When my boyfriend finally successfully captures him and locks him downstairs, the other dog will open the gate for him minutes later, starting the cycle all over again.

The pitbull mix is also highly aggressive towards my boyfriend’s other (female) dog. They’ve had a litter of puppies together and the female isn’t spayed, so sometimes he’s just randomly fully mounting her and they will stand in the hallway while he’s stuck inside of her. He bites her (in an aggressive manner) and snarls/growls at her regularly, steals her toys from her when she’s relaxing with them, and tries to attack her if she is receiving any sort of attention. He often will eat her food before she’s had a chance to even get to it and my boyfriend won’t refill her dish so she’ll go hungry. The dogs fight often (not friendly play fighting) and 50% of the time it’s directly on top of me while I’m in my boyfriend’s bed. Snarling, hairs standing on all ends, gnashing their teeth at each other, biting each other while the other yelps, etc. The female dog’s head is often entirely wet from being chewed on by him.

The male dog (pitbull mix) also pees all over the wooden coffee table and rug any time he is locked downstairs, every single time without fail. The living room constantly smells overwhelmingly like dog urine. Sometimes he defecates on the rug too despite my boyfriend literally leaving his back door OPEN 24/7 so that the dogs can use the restroom as needed. They still decide to go in the house.

The female dog is crazy destructive. She has eaten my shoes, multiple tubes of my chapstick, gets into the trash daily and shreds it everywhere, has eaten multiple sex toys, and always gets into food—she recently got into and ate an entire 5 pound box of fruit gummies in a single night. Last night, she attempted to eat an entire 1 pound bag of Reeses Cups that had I not been awake to confiscate she would have devoured entirely and likely made herself sick. My boyfriend seemed indifferent to the fact that she could have died from this. She chews the handles off of knives and scissors and eats entire TV remotes and pairs of sunglasses. She eats entire towels, shirts and pairs of pants. Most of my boyfriend’s clothes have holes in them. She obsessively licks the bed and blankets for hours straight due to stress so she leaves giant smelly wet spots everywhere she’s been. 

She is an escape artist and often escapes from my boyfriend’s fenced in backyard. I’ve had to chase her down on multiple occasions and she’ll just keep running and wagging her tail like it’s a game. It’s super dangerous because we live in a populated city downtown in a high traffic urban area and I was genuinely afraid she was going to get hit by a car.

This is all in addition to the usual annoying dog traits: constant, incessant aggressive barking at any and every passerby, at cars, at nothing; constant, incessant licking of their genitals; constant, incessant whining and barking when they’re locked downstairs. Before they figured out how to get through the gate, they would whine and bark nonstop for literal hours while downstairs. They shed everywhere and there is dog hair covering every square inch of the house and the furniture and I’m extremely allergic. They drink out of the toilet and eat feces. At night, both dogs not only sleep on the bed—they sleep on MY pillow at the top of the bed and, throughout the course of the night, push me off until I have about a 2 foot width of space on my boyfriend’s king sized bed and no pillow to rest my head on at all. Sometimes one of the dogs will legitimately sit on my head as I sleep and I’ll wake up not being able to breathe. As soon as I move, they steal my spot.

My boyfriend has done nothing to train either of these dogs nor correct these behaviors and in fact reinforces/enables them. He even thinks it’s cute when they act out and has told me this. He will reward them with pets and cuddles after they destroy something or break through the baby gate or escape or attack me and refuses to crate train them. He has literally stopped paying attention to me on multiple occasions to spoon his dogs in bed after they forcibly push me out of my space. Sometimes I will sit for an hour or two and watch him cuddle his dogs and coo and baby talk at them as I am uncomfortably sat on the very foot of his king sized bed, like a dog, waiting for him to do something or notice because the dogs are occupying the entire upper half of the bed that people are meant to sleep in and I have no place to sit or lay. He often laughs at this because he thinks it’s funny that they try to steal my spot all of the time. I don’t because it’s severely affecting my sleep and ability to relax.

His relationship with his female dog is very strange to me—he even tracks her cycle to know when she’s in heat, regularly talks about wanting her to have another litter, and spanks her butt regularly. TMI, but one time while I was being spanked during sex and she was in the room, the dog got *jealous* and positioned herself to be spanked while making this weird expression at him.

While his pitbull mix leers at me, violates my space and exhibits obvious signs of aggression, my boyfriend will claim the dog is doing this because he likes me and wants to be near me. My boyfriend has realized that kisses/hugs/touch trigger his dog to try to attack me and all he had to say about it was that the dog is “spoiled” and attached to him and just wants what everyone else has. He says he’s always been like this since he was a puppy, down to the biting issues. He has never tried to correct any of the biting behaviors and sometimes will sit and do nothing while the dog is actively biting or chewing on me in an aggressive way.

I just am at a loss of what to do. Both dogs are only a few years old, so if I stay in this relationship, I’ll inevitably have to deal with them for quite some time to come and I already feel like I’m going crazy. This is getting to be all too much and I’m so devastated because I love this man so much aside from these issues with his dogs. However, I know for a fact that he views his dogs on the same level as me and would never rehome them or even make sacrifices for my comfort such as simply disallowing them on the bed. I’m so upset over all of this and have no idea what to do moving forward. I also have a 🐈 that I know for a fact would not be able to cohabitate in the same space as these dogs as they are extremely aggressive towards each other and all other animals. Due to this, I don’t even know if I could realistically move in with him which kills me.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How should I even handle this?

# Training

33M: I ran the Chicago Marathon 6 weeks prior to this race, so most of my training can be found in that [race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1g48is3/race_report_2024_chicago_marathon_23234_for/).

After Chicago, my mileage was as follows:

Week 1 (down week): 34 miles  
Week 2: 97 miles  
Week 3: 100 miles  
Week 4: 80 Miles  
Week 5: 70 miles  
Race week: 31 miles prior to race

I was actually pretty surprised with how my body responded after Chicago. By the middle of week 2 I was actually feeling pretty good and hit an 18-miler with some miles at marathon effort. I also managed to get a 22-miler in (with some quicker efforts) during the 100-mile week. This short block went by very quickly, and the taper came before I knew it.

# Pre-race

I was definitely a bit nervous coming into this race for many reasons, but those reasons were mainly: running another marathon right after Chicago, racing on a course with 3x more elevation than Chicago, and racing on a slightly windy day (10 mph).

I was originally in the seeded field for this race, which usually starts in the same corral as the elite field, but this year they split up the seeded runners and the elites since they were offering prize money for the open division. They did give us a choice to move up to elite if we wanted to, so I opted to do that.

I think this was the right choice--the pre-race hospitality (warming tent, private bathrooms, private gear check) really took the stress out of race morning. I really appreciated being able to wear my warmups basically until race time and then being able to pick them back up in the tent after the race. Yeah, I felt like a bit of an imposter, but I'll take these perks any day.

We probably got to the elite tent itself a little before 6 AM. I had time to chat with some folks, eat a banana, and grab a bit more coffee before using the bathroom twice and starting my warmup. I did some dynamic stretches and drills and then got in a short jog in w/ some pickups. Before I knew it, it was time to head to the start line, where we were able to do some strides. We were supposed to start at 7 AM, but it was a little delayed (the half was the day before, too) and so we were off at 7:09!

# Race

I felt pretty good right out of the gate. We had a nice group of guys in my pack from the beginning (maybe 5-6), so these early miles felt pretty good. The energy from the crowds downtown in these first miles is great--I really think Philly is the best big-city marathon in the US outside of the majors (some might even prefer it to the majors), and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fall marathon. These early miles are pretty flat, so we were just cruising. Hit 5k in 17:37.

The wind was coming from the west on race morning, and this early in the race I wasn't really feeling anything. At about mile 5 we made the turn onto Chestnut and started heading out west into a headwind, but I think we were pretty protected here by the buildings, and I didn't feel the wind much here. Some minimal climbing between 5k and 10k, but nothing crazy. 10k in 35:32.

At this point we still had a pack of about 5 of us, but were starting to spread out just a bit. Heading over the Walnut Street bridge and out toward UPenn is when I really felt the wind for the first time, but it wasn't too bad. This is also the exact moment in which I remembered u/sprodown's shitposting in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1gsvf4r/philadelphia_marathon/): ""The headwinds are only headwinds if you’re slow. Go faster, and they’ll be tailwinds."" Had myself a laugh at this point, which was good, because we were about to start the first real climb as we headed up north. I had fallen a bit off the pack, but managed to reconnect during the climb without wasting too much effort. All the real climbs happen between about 7.5 miles and the halfway point of the race, so I knew if I could make it to half feeling not too beat up from the climbs I'd be in for a decent race. 15k in 53:23.

Mile 10 starts with a short climb, followed by a nice downhill heading right into the biggest climb of the race. I actually handled this section pretty well, but my legs needed a bit of time to get back up to speed as we heading onto Avenue of the Republic. Our pack was pretty split at this point, with a couple of pairs of guys running together and then a couple of us running alone in between (myself included). Despite no longer being in a pack, I could see the guys ahead of me, and this helped a lot with keeping pace. Another climb and crossed halfway in 1:15:45.

I was definitely behind where I wanted to be at this point, but I feeling pretty decent physically and was happy to have made it through all of the serious hills. This part of the course was probably the most boring, though, as I was still running alone and the crowd support was pretty sparse. It's a bit twisty here as you navigate the park, and I much prefer running long, straight stretches of road (it's easier for me to lock in mentally). Huge downhill coming out of park here and heading north, and I split one of my fastest miles (mile 16) here. As I passed \~16.2 I said ""single digits now"" out loud and prepared to lock in for what is always the hardest part (mentally) of the marathon for me: miles 16–20.

As I got onto Kelly Drive, I started to really feel the wind for the first time. I even make some remark about it as I passed my coach along Kelly. ""No problem,"" I told myself, ""I'll have a nice tailwind coming home."" More on that later. 30k in 1:47:54. I was yo-yoing with a guy who had initially passed me as we first got onto Kelly. I think he was dealing with some cramps, but I'm relatively certain that he came out Corral A, so he probably had a finishing time 4-5 minutes faster than me. Regardless, he was keeping a decent pace and was a good person to chase during this stretch. 

Heading up into Manayunk is a ton of fun, as the crowds really turn out here and bring a ton of energy. It's really needed at this point, because there is a small climb (maybe 30 ft. or so) that feels a lot bigger than it actually is because of where it's at on the course and because you see folks heading down on the other side as they tackle the last 10k of the race. 20.1 miles in 1:56:25 (random, but I'm pretty sure this corresponds with the turnaround).

I still felt relatively good at the turnaround and was excited for the final part of the race. However, to my surprise, I was hit with what felt like another headwind as I got back onto Kelly heading in the opposite direction. ""What gives?"" I thought. Alas, I remembered u/niceguy542006's words in the Philly thread linked above: ""girding myself for the wonderful headwinds heading out on Kelly Drive, which always seem to also be headwinds coming back from Kelly drive."" Prophetic.

I was starting to fade with 5k to go when I really should have been stepping on the gas. I had a bit of a side stitch that I couldn't kick, which was making breathing a bit more labored than it needed to be. Honestly though, I think I've gotta work on being more mentally tough in the last 10k overall of a race. I was hurting a bit here, but I could have made myself hurt more. 1 mile to go: 2:26:25.

The last half mile has a bit of a climb, which is never fun at the end of a marathon lol. When I could make out the clock, I saw something like 2:31:45 and knew I would just miss my A goal. I managed to close pretty hard and felt like I was absolutely flying in this last mile. It's all relative, obviously, because I split like 5:43 here--faster than my overall average pace, but not by any means my fastest mile of the race. 

Crossed the finish in 2:32:07 (chip)--a 27-second PR following a PR at Chicago just 6 weeks earlier! As always, I wanted a bit more on the day, but I've got be happy about another PR after a quick turnaround and racing on a more difficult course!

# What's Next?

So this is 6 marathon PRs in a row dating from Chicago 2022 to now. I have to shout out my coach, Dylan Gearinger, who was out on the course on Sunday and has been great to work with over the past 2.5 years. Great guy, great coach.

I'm going to work on some top end speed this winter before moving into a marathon block. I'm signed up for Project 13.1 in March and am hoping to rip a nasty half on what is an extremely quick course. I know we've got some other folks from this sub signed up as well, so looking forward to seeing you all there. After this, I'm pretty sure I'll do the Jersey City Marathon in April. Looks like a flat and fast course.

Thanks for reading!

1h0gjl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1h0gjl0/i_drunkenly_broke_no_contact_and_now_im_meeting/,"I Drunkenly Broke No Contact, and Now I’m Meeting My Fearful Avoidant Ex","Five weeks ago, my (25y) Fearful Avoidant (FA -27y) girlfriend broke up with me. A week after the breakup, we met up to exchange some belongings. The interaction felt just like old times—it was fun, comfortable, and we even ended up being intimate with each other. After that, I decided to go fully No Contact.

For a few weeks, I managed to stick to No Contact, but last weekend, I broke it in a drunken moment at 5:00 AM and called her (I know, I know…). To my surprise, she picked up, and we had a really good conversation. In the call she told me she still loves me (she didn’t drink). The next day, I texted her, and we had another nice chat through messages.

Yesterday, I asked her if she’d like to grab a coffee sometime. She agreed and suggested coming over to my place, but I proposed meeting in the city to avoid the possibility of us becoming intimate again, as I felt that might complicate things. She initially saw this as me viewing the meetup as a “date” and responded with this message:

“But love, now it sounds like a date, and I’d like to catch up and hand over the last of your things. But I also don’t want to give you false hope (something that she also said the last time - before we got intimate.”

I told her I don’t have any hope and that we’re just going to talk (have fun talk -not too indept about the break-up). She respected that, and we agreed to meet for coffee in the city.

I’ve watched 1,000 videos about No Contact, and it feels stupid to have ruined it like this while drunk. But honestly, I was happy we had a good conversation and that we’re now meeting up again. Still, her message today shook me. It feels like all the progress I made during No Contact might have been for nothing.

My gut tells me that Sunday will go well, and that we will have fun, and that this is just her defense mechanism kicking in and wants to stay in control because she is still not sure how she will feel when she sees me.

For anyone who might say, “Why would you even want her back?”—I get it. But the truth is, I still feel confused about the current situation and i felt that I didn’t make any process in the last 2 weeks. Things don’t feel resolved, especially because our relationship ended so abruptly, and the last time we saw each other, we had such a good time together. So for my own mental health its better to have some clarity.

I’d really love to hear your thoughts:
	• How do you interpret her message? Is this truly the end, or is it just part of typical Fearful Avoidant patterns and I just should take it easy? Could it mean less than it seems? 
	• How should I approach this meeting? What can I do to keep it positive and productive without creating too many expectations?
	• Does anyone have experience dealing with a Fearful Avoidant partner after a breakup? What worked for you in maintaining or rebuilding a connection?

I wanted slow increases like 1.25 or 1.5 but dr put me on 1.7 for two weeks (but i did it for one month) and then said to switch it o 2.5 or 2.7 which is the MAX for wegovy! I was concerned and said that might be too high but he said no i have to follow that path. I was hesitant but agreed. Obv after the 1.7 i still felt fine, low appetite and wanted to stay on that dose and asked the pharmacist if they can just give me the same dose again since I did not want to go higher but they needed the dr approval but he is away until December 2nd.

I started looking more in to coffee stuff and found out that there doesn't seem to be a single soul who brews their coffee this way. I tried doing it ""normally"", brewing coffee by itself and then adding cream, but it came out much too bitter. Plus I had to heat the milk separately or face tepid coffee. 

I think the lower temp of the milk in the pot cools the coffee as it comes out so it doesn't scorch and tastes very smooth.

We create an advanced, reliable and very efficient free software in these fields.

In relation, programmers tend to be interested in all kinds of things and there are farmers, cooks, all kind of people and journeys of life, where a programmer builds a house in home. Still, this is a really statistical distribution, where one might like to play golf and another really keeps their house clean. For such fields, we have rather people who \*pretend\* making open source, succeeding in being first in google with their ""open source"" product with heavy community restrictions or the fact that it's a trial appearing in the last page of registration, or where you get it for free, but for some reason you must definitely enter your credit card data or phone number.

My idea is that actually, people from different fields should start open source projects, missing programmers and it managers, not only testers and designers. They should work on their needs, create user stories, list the algorithms and equations they use and define, which user interfaces are typical in their fields. This is a big part of a programming product in sense that when we have this, we can really consider this. They could even set up jira, documentations, maybe even AI chatbot, using some free services, or they could create github account to contain their documentations, plans and milestones. They could define colors, designs, create photos and solve many things they can. In each field, some people are exceptionally intelligent - but this does not mean that they can freely handle each science, including tech; this means that they can have some understanding about what is possible and what is not, and they could be quite logical and clear with their documentation, like writing understandable text and providing the basic equations, standards, or UI design ideas.

This is complex topic and should be discussed, how much needs to be done for this, but later, the products could be connected, such as time management for cooks and time management for cleaners - those projects could join. But definitely, having the documentation and even the work to simplify and order the product plan in a way that with agile methods, a programmer could have something initial and useful in a week, such as a sql table and basic UI for vitamin list management. In decent world, the starter of open source project could as well create something basic with AI, such as prototype of an user interface, where one can enter food product names and list the vitamins. The AI-generated product is not a full product, but we can start from this to have a prototype. Once all this work is done, it's a pleasure to start such product - especially if we take it all together and create a community, where the people can meet.

What I mean is that a non-technical person would describe, document and plan their dream. It's funny if someone is going to provide people for free with something they don't really have, but it's actually practical and useful in this case - for my own understanding, I would like to create something for cooks or mountain climbers, possibly, but I really cannot catch the specific details of the work, such as when a waiter can remember about my sitting position, and coffee and a cake, what they would do if I still order 30 different things.",3,1732639266.0,opensource,0,1.0,False

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

You tiptoe past the squeaky floorboard, your heart pounding with anticipation. It’s time.

You reach your desk. The faint whir of your monitor coming to life is the only sound now. A hot cup of coffee/tea/energy drink sits nearby, steam swirling like the fog of Act 1. You click on your launcher, hands trembling. The *Grinding Gear Games* logo appears.

There it is: *Path of Exile 2*. The ""Play"" button glistens like a level 13 uncut skill gem.

You hesitate. A single tear rolls down your cheek. You take a deep breath, cherishing the moment. ""I've waited for this,"" you whisper. Your hand hovers over the mouse. You click. The screen flashes to life, the game boots up, and a menu more beautiful than any Elder-influenced map you've ever seen awaits you.

1h0g5xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1h0g5xl/the_hope_of_meeting_each_other_again_in_the_right/,The hope of meeting each other again in the right time when we’re both matured ,"Problem/Goal: Sometimes, when we see each other, we greet each other like we’re still together. Ewan, maybe it’s just me, but whenever I see him, I really feel that sense of comfort. Back then, right after we broke up, we’d avoid each other like, we wouldn’t talk at all, unlike now. Before, whenever we’d cross paths, I wouldn’t even acknowledge him, and he’d do the same. It was all about avoiding each other. That was also the time I decided to give up begging for him to stay I just got so tired.
But now, it’s so different when we see each other. We say hello, wave, or do that eyebrow raiseganon, HAHAHAHA! we decided to meet during the intrams at their school. I went because my friend kept pushing me to gowala naman akong choice kasi magtatampo raw siya, so I said, “sige naaa” That time, I messaged him to let him know I was at their school. He replied, saying he wasn’t there because he was watching a game somewhere else. I just left it at that, didn’t make a big deal of it, but to be honest, nalungkot talaga si ate gurl.
Then, after a few hours, he suddenly messaged me, asking if I was still on campus. I said yes, and he replied, “wait for me”
Behhhhh, yung gutom ko bilang na walaaa puro kilig na lang!

And then we finally met. Sobrang daming tao that time. We bought iced coffee and sat down somewhere, kahit sobrang daming naglalakad sa harap namin. Ewan, we just didn’t care. We laughed like crazy, parang baliw lang. I can’t even remember most of what we talked about basta puro tawa lang kami. A few minutes passed, and the crowd started to thin out kasi may laro yata during that time. That’s when the conversation turned serious seryosong usapan kungbaga
HAHAHA.
Bigla na lang siyang nagsabi na ganon pa rin daw ako maganda pa rin daw. Pabiro niya ’yon, pero syempre sabi ko, “Syempre, ano pa ba?” Nagyabang pa ako ng konti. Then out of nowhere, he asked me why I blocked him on IG, TikTok, and Facebook. I just said, “Ewan, siguro for peace of mind lang.”
I held his hand, and he smiled. Then he put his arm around me. I didn’t say anything we just stayed silent for a few minutes. Then he said, “Siguro kung tayo pa ngayon, ang dami pa nating good memories na magagawa.” Sabay tanong, “Bakit ayaw mo na magbalikan tayo?”
Actually, he had asked me that before, pero during that time, sobrang daming ganap sa buhay ko. I was so stressed, drained, and completely out of it mga months before we saw each other. Kaya sinabi ko noon “ ayaw ko”

Balik tayo sa present. When he asked me again, I just shook my head. Gustuhin ko man, ewan, mas pinili ko na lang ang sarili ko. I was so drained back then parang naubos ako. He was my comfort whenever I felt down, pero iniwan niya rin ako. Ang dami kong narealize nung napagod na ako. But I’ll admit, I still want him. The thing is, I feel like if we get back together, masasaktan lang ulit kami. So, I just shook my head.
I put my arm around him and teased him instead, para maiba ang usapan. Then he said, “Eh di i-backhug mo na lang ako.” So I did walang hiya-hiya na. Feeling ko kasi, that would be the last time we’d see each other. Kaya sinulit ko na. I hugged him tightly while he kept talking, and then he held my hand, stroking it gently before kissing it.
By the way, I was his first girlfriend. There was a time I asked him if he had a greatest love, and he said it was me. Same kami he’s my first boyfriend and my greatest love. 
We met last month, October. After that, we chatted for a few days, but when he sent the last message, I didn’t reply anymore.

if we're not messaging each other anymore,I'll always pray for you to live your best life.

She’s been a constant in my life, from our toddler years to now. We were super close throughout elementary, middle, and high school, but we grew a bit distant during college since we attended different schools.

Our relationship hasn’t always been great, though. Over the years, resentment has built up because of certain events. For example:

Sophie and I were eligible for a free trip abroad. We’d been planning to go together, and the best time to go was during college so we could join others from our area. I decided to wait for Sophie. Then, in October 2022, I got a text from her out of the blue saying she’d signed up for the trip—and that she was sorry she hadn’t told me. What upset me most was that (1) she didn’t tell me until after registration had closed, and (2) she had signed up three weeks earlier without saying a word. I understood she wanted to go on the trip alone, but not telling me for weeks felt like a betrayal.

But that wasn’t the only issue.

In middle school, my core friend group was Sophie, Abby, Janie, and me. I introduced Sophie and Abby, and they became so close they started hanging out without me. I felt excluded and hurt. Eventually, I became closer to Janie, and our group dynamic shifted. We all hung out as a foursome, but it was clear that Sophie and Abby were closer, while Janie and I were tight.

In high school, Sophie got a boyfriend and started ditching us to spend time with him. It got so bad we confronted her, and she outright told us, “He’s more important to me than you guys.” That ended her friendship with Janie, who didn’t hold back during the confrontation. Meanwhile, Abby started hanging out with Janie and me more, but eventually, Abby and Janie became closer and started excluding me—just like Sophie and Abby had in middle school.

Fast forward: Abby, Sophie, and I stayed in touch over the years, while Janie moved to Florida for college. I was the only one who kept in contact with her.

In November 2023, Janie moved back home, and we started hanging out like old times, seeing each other 4-5 times a week. A few months later, Abby reached out, asking if she could join us. I was hesitant because I didn’t want to feel excluded again, but I decided to give it a shot. Reconnecting went surprisingly well, and the three of us started hanging out twice a month.

At Abby’s birthday party, Sophie showed up. It was the first time she and Janie had seen each other in years. At first, the reunion seemed fine, but then Sophie pulled me aside to talk trash about Janie. It was clear she still hadn’t moved past their confrontation from high school, which annoyed me.

Now, fast forward to September 2024: Sophie got engaged and invited me to coffee, where she asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was excited and said yes. During the conversation, she mentioned booking Airbnbs for the bridal party, and I said, “I can’t wait to share an Airbnb with Abby!” That’s when Sophie dropped a bombshell: “Oh, about that—Abby hates you.”

I was shocked and asked her to explain. Sophie made me swear not to confront anyone, then told me Janie had supposedly told Abby that I hated her and didn’t want to hang out with her. Months earlier, I’d vented to Janie that Abby didn’t really “fill my cup” anymore and that hanging out with her felt different, but I never said I hated her.

The next day, I had a double date planned with Janie and couldn’t keep this to myself. I asked her about it, and she admitted that Abby had texted her after we all hung out, saying she wanted nothing to do with me. Janie responded by saying I felt the same.

Even though we cleared the air, I still felt uneasy. When Sophie later asked if I’d confronted Janie, I told her the truth, which led to a huge fight between us. After days of arguing, I asked to meet in person to talk, but Sophie refused.

At that point, I realized Sophie had been a terrible friend to me for years. I was only holding onto our friendship because of how long we’d known each other. I texted her, explaining that I couldn’t be in her wedding and that our friendship wasn’t healthy. I haven’t heard from her since.

So, Reddit, AITAH for pulling out of her wedding and ending our 20+ year friendship?

All that said, goes to show the endurance that Biz had to cover that much ground retreating from those guys, holding his own AFTER throwing down inside the bar and coming out practically unscathed for what could have been.

* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

Lara is a sahm to our boys and takes the boys 3 days a week to take care of her grandmother who has dementia, the other 4 days a nurse comes in. I work in retail management. My typical schedule is 1pm-10pm with a one hour lunch if I choose to take it. 

I live about 45 minutes from my job and I like to head out a bit early, get a coffee and quick bite and send some emails from a cafe before walking into work. This means I typically leave the house between 8:30-9am in the mornings. After work I'm often frustrated so I stop by the 24 hour gym I'm a member at and run the treadmill or lift weights for a bit. This puts be getting home at 12 or just after. On weekends I often have things planned with family or friends that tend to use up a portion of my day.

Lara is telling me I need to stick around to help her more in the mornings. She's insisting my routine isn't all that important and I'm making her feel like a single mom. From my perspective, I enjoy my routine, I get some peace and quiet and it's a nice way for me to prepare for and end my day. Lara want me to be at home until she either leaves with the boys to her grandmother's or until it's closer to noon. If I did that I'd completely miss being able to go to the cafe and deal with emails while I mentally prepare myself for the day. She doesn't mind me going to the gym so much as she's usually asleep by the time I get home. I've offered to ask my sister or mom to come over and help her in the mornings a day or two a week but she rejected that idea. I feel like I've offered a compromise of sorts but Lara tells me I haven't. AITA",0,1732638412.0,AmItheAsshole,94,0.37,False

1h0ftee,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1h0ftee/where_all_my_friends_went/,Where all my friends went,"Like many people here I have (almost) no friends and have made a few attempts over the last couple of years that didn't work out at all. I have one friend who I get together with about once every month or two for coffee. That's it.

So I thought I'd look back and catalog where my friends went. I'll use stars for their names to protect the innocent.

A\*\*\*\* - He and I were best friends in grade school and high school. Both socially awkward nerds really keen on living life ""correctly"" according to the Catholic Church. By the time I was half way through high school I realized we weren't on the same page at all... because I wanted to date girls, and he barely cared about anything other than cards and D&D. Lost touch completely in my final year when I switched schools (even though neither of us left town). Apparently he's married and has kids.

J\*\*\*\*\* - High school friend who shared my angst, but was seemingly more willing to do something about it. I remember visiting him every day in the mental health wing of the hospital, which was pretty fun. We used to hang out and listen to the *Pogues* and *Therapy?*. He barely avoided joining the IRA, instead joining the army. We went out for coffee once just after I started dating my wife and that was the last I saw of him, except for a photo of him in uniform with a big gun and that giant smile of his.

R\*\*\* - Knew him in grade school, became friends in high school. He introduced me to metal, techno, all kinds of electronic music, and acid. We spent an entire summer together in his shitty bachelor apartment sometime after high school. He found a good mix of pharmaceuticals to keep him happy and productive, DJ'd, moved to Toronto. We stayed in touch. I told him I loved him, and I really meant it. He passed away a few years ago of cancer and it still hurts like a son of a bitch. I miss him so much.

J\*\*\*\* - Best friend in late high school and early 20s. Gave me my first drink and first smoke. Also my first gay friend. Spent years after we stopped hanging out kicking myself for not being more tuned into my bi-side at that stage of my life and missing the times he'd been hitting on me, but it's probably for the best. We reconnected sometime in my mid-30s and he was exactly the same person - I mean *exactly*. Which kinda meant we'd grown apart.

V\*\*\*\* - We were best friends in my early 20s for a few years - just two lost people looking for comfort I think. I got real awkward with her and she kind of cut me off after she moved out West. Didn't even call when she came back into town, which hurt. I was awkward again with her in messages later. Baffled at my own behavior it was pointed out to me that I was likely in love with her. Dammit... yes that was the problem. If only I'd realized it and processed it instead of being a weirdo. She made the right move cutting me out.

A\*\*\* & B\*\*\*\* - College friends. We hung out every day, drank together, had lots of fun, then after college... met up one time and had absolutely nothing to say to each other. Weird.

V\*\*\*\* - Dated for a bit. She was great, but I was a mess at the time. I broke up with her but she really should have dumped my ass. Amazing person though, would totally hang out if they weren't on the other side of the ocean now.

S\*\* - Speaking of people I... ""dated""... well, S\*\* and I had an incredibly odd relationship. Magical, in some ways, but ultimately unhealthy. Based around me being dominant while the whole time I was incredibly intimidated by her and in the throes of untreated ADHD and depression and a lifetime of issues that therapy would need to work through... so... ya. It ended badly, but honestly could have been worse. To this day I wish I could find her to apologize for being such a dumbass.

D\*\*\* - I always thought he was way cooler than me. Late in our relationship I worked out he looked at me in a similar way which I find baffling. We hung out a few times a week for years but I let this one go I think around my late 20s when he started getting a bit racist and sexist in that ""trying to prove I'm one of the guys"" kind of way.

The L\*\*\*\*\*\* sisters - Knew them since grade school and all through high school but we lost touch afterwards. I always felt like I needed to be on my best behavior with them. No idea why. Tried to reach out later and it was just as disquieting. Not their fault, lovely people, I have no idea wtf was going on there...

S\*\*\*\* - Met through work. Loved this guy. Super chill. We carpooled, hung out at work, really vibed for years and years. Went to his wedding. And then suddenly... idk something happened. Felt like a weird wall appeared between us and he was just waiting for me to go away.

A\*\*\*\* - Met through work but she was just plain too young. We got along, good for a laugh, hung out after work and stuff, I set her up with a good therapist I know... but eventually there was this thing where it felt like we were on different planets.

M\*\*\* - Part of the downtown crew. Hung out in my 20s and 30s, got close enough I'd have even called him my best friend. But we had a disagreement, he went out of his way to tell lies and burn my reputation among a community I was heavily involved in at the time, and that was it. The time away helped - gradually came to realize how full of it he is and how little effort he puts into actually healing and growing. I've forgiven him but I hung out with him one Saturday and realized this was not a good scene - talking about the same old BS with big opinions on things he has no way of knowing anything about. Forget it.

C\*\*\*\*\*\*\* - When we met we connected instantly - like people who knew each other in a previous life and were just reconnecting. We were really close (without anything romantic at all between us). But she was never in town and travel time to see her got excessive, and gradually we just plain lost touch. And it's weird now because part of me feels like the guy she knew back then is just not who I am anymore so it would feel odd to reach out.

L\*\*\*\*\* - One of those friends who you feel like you really see eye to eye with for a long time and then, suddenly, you don't. Like one day I woke up and realized we were on different planets and always had been. No hard feelings at all but she doesn't call and neither do I.

D\*\*\* - Still a friend technically (went to her wedding last year) although we only hear from her these days if she's really upset and needs to process it. Haven't heard from her in months so I suppose things are going well.

A\*\*\* - Met through work, hung out on the regular for years through my 30s. I liked him because he was ""genuine"", even if he was a spaz. Lots of energy. But gradually his habit of ignoring everything I said and just going on about whatever he was currently obsessed with got boring. And he was late all the time which I can't handle. And... well I wasn't crazy about how he dealt with some family stuff. So I kinda stopped taking his calls.

So there's my wife and my one friend I see every month or two, and that's it. There's a bunch of people I'm friendly with but obviously that's different.

I've met plenty of people, and still do, but typing this all out I'm realizing I haven't made a real new friend in 10 or more years. There is literally nobody here that I spent much time with in my 40s at all.

Sorry about the length. When I started this I thought it would be a lot more interesting than it turned out to be. But it's just mildly sad I guess.",6,1732638232.0,GenX,9,0.69,False

1h0fsgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CopperIUD/comments/1h0fsgv/positive_experience_iud_insertion/,Positive experience IUD insertion!,"Hey guys! I hope you’re doing great! :)

I wanted to share my experience with getting an IUD yesterday, especially for anyone out there browsing for firsthand accounts (like I was for the past few weeks). I noticed there are way more negative stories than positive ones, so I wanted to share mine—it was overwhelmingly positive!

Some background:
I got the Mona Lisa 5 Mini in Canada (Montreal). I’m 30, this is my first IUD, and I’ve never been pregnant. I paid for everything out of pocket, but I know insurance often covers most or all of it (rules vary by province, so definitely check!).

I went to a private clinic and was surprised they could see me within a week—I’d read stories about people waiting 2-3 months. They were super transparent about the costs and optional tests, which I appreciated.

At the clinic:
Everyone was so nice! I told them I was nervous, and they reassured me the nurse practitioner doing the procedure was amazing (spoiler: she was!). After a quick blood pressure check and a pregnancy test, I met with her, and she explained everything step by step. She was so kind and honest, which really helped ease my anxiety.

She did mention the process could be uncomfortable and that pain varies depending on your tolerance, how relaxed you are, and whether your cervix is dilated enough. (If it isn’t, they might refer you to a gynecologist who can use different tools to help.)

Since I was anxious, she offered 4 sedative injections—I said yes immediately! (Some people refuse them because they’re afraid of needles, but I wasn’t about to take that chance.) For context, I also took 3 ashwagandha tablets earlier in the day and 2 ibuprofen before my appointment.

The insertion process:
Guys, it was NOTHING. I was so nervous for weeks, but honestly, it was totally fine. The whole thing took maybe 20 minutes.
	•	She injected the sedatives, which were a little uncomfortable but manageable.
	•	She measured my uterus and used a cold clamp (again, not bad).
	•	Did a quick swab for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
	•	Then inserted the IUD—it felt like a sudden, heavier menstrual cramp, but it only lasted a few seconds.

I kept talking and asking her questions the entire time, which helped distract me. When she said, “Okay, I’m cutting the strings now,” I was like, That’s it?! I couldn’t believe how quick and easy it was.

Aftercare tips:
She gave me a panty liner in case of spotting (bring one just in case!) and explained the basics:
	•	Watch out for signs of infection (high fever, extreme cramps, or nonstop bleeding).
	•	No sex for a week, even though the copper IUD works immediately.
	•	No tampons or anything vaginally for 48 hours.

She also said not to obsessively check the strings myself since people sometimes tug them without realizing it. I’ll go for an ultrasound in 3 weeks and a follow-up at the clinic in 6 weeks to make sure everything’s in place.

After the appointment:
About an hour later, I felt a bit dizzy and had some heavy cramps, but Tylenol, a heating pad, and a nap fixed me right up. Bathroom trips weren’t bad either. Right now, I’m sitting in a coffee shop with my legs crossed writing this, and everything feels fine so far!

Costs:
Here’s what I paid:
	•	$200 for the consultation.
	•	$95 for the insertion.
	•	$120 for optional chlamydia/gonorrhea tests.

I think the prices were reasonable for private care, but I know insurance can cover some or all of it.

Final thoughts:
If you’re considering getting an IUD and feeling anxious—don’t be! It was such a smooth and manageable experience, and I hope this post reassures you. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I’ll update in a few months! :)",3,1732638169.0,CopperIUD,0,1.0,False

I'm currently deciding between the **Timemore Sculptor 064S** and the **DF64 Gen 2** for espresso. My main priority is precise dialing for espresso shots, and I'm curious about which grinder would be the better long-term choice.

I know both have stepless adjustments, but I’m particularly wondering if the **064S's espresso grind range** is sufficient for consistent and precise dialing, or if I might find it limiting over time compared to the DF64 Gen 2.

I also like that the 064S has adjustable RPM (800–1200), which seems helpful for handling freshly roasted beans, but I’m unsure how much that actually impacts espresso grinding in practice.

What are your thoughts? Has anyone used both models and can provide some insight into their performance specifically for espresso?

I configurate my Wire guard server in my Brume 2, all correct. In my personal computer and in my personal phone the Wire guard server is working, I see that my ip when I turn ON the Wireguard is the same IP as in my home when I was in a coffee today.

But there is a problem with my work computer, I do exactly the same but... I don't see the IP of my home, after turning ON the wire guard client. I see another.

What happens? I realized that it doesn't matter what wi-fi I'm using, in my home, my phone hotspot, a coffee.. I always have the same IP, when I go to WHATSMYIP I see that the IP is different than other devices when I'm in my home, and even the ISP is different, is: Zscaler. What is Zscaler? A cybersecurity company, probably all the traffic is enrouted at the end to an IP and they are doing the cybersecurity stuff for my company.

Even I see that Wireguard is active in my work laptop as a client while I see the IP of the DataCenter of Zscaler, at the end.

I can't change anything of routes or whatever because I need admin permission, Wire guard is not working. I thought that maybe what is happening is that wireguard takes the IP of my home and later the IP of the enrouting of Zscaler, so at the end I'm connecting from the V PN of my home but the final IP is of that cybersecurity company, but is something that I don't know how to check.

Do you know how to check it or anyone know show to overpass this?

Or even with GL inet routers I can't overpass this layer?",0,1732637872.0,digitalnomad,10,0.5,False

They're eating shit now and are seeking me out.,"I heard it from some outside sources (people who are in the outer circle, not inner) told me what happened. I was at work and a guy who's always along the outskirts of the friend group, came up to me and said

""I have tea."" And I was confused because we don't talk like that. He comes to my work, i make him coffee and he briefly tells me about his life and leaves.

He told me a couple in my group broke up because someone got cheated on and the other person is on cocaine and he's never home I was like ???
He said that guy was kicked out of the group and everyone hates him, that's his karma. All i could think about was how culty this clique is.

And then a few hours later someone else reached out to me saying that a few other people left recently. The drama was too much and there's someone in there inciting the arguments.

All while being told that they're all thinking about me. How I left 9 months ago and how they think I saw it coming. How they think im a hard worker and they want good standing with me.

I have no social media so they have no updates on my life whatsoever. But the guy who gets coffee from me, hes still in contact with some people in that group and he'd relayed that I've looked happier and better. So they seek me out at work.

I feel icky. I feel adrenaline now. I'm waiting for it to pass so I can move in with my life again.",1,1732637733.0,venting,1,1.0,False
1h0fluh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1h0fluh/sudden_hearing_loss_10_month_ago_symptoms_keep/,"Sudden hearing loss 10 month ago, symptoms keep getting weirder","Hello,

First of all the details according to the sub rules: 

About me: F 34 years old, 175cm, 73 kg, central europe, white, no medication, 

Medical history: nothing relevant except having been diagnosed with a tiny ear trumpet after having reoccurring middle ear infections when I was a child and every couple of years in my adulthood.

General health: I do 1-3 (about 50-90 minutes) workouts per week at home (either yoga, pilates, or weighlifting). My daily steps average between 8000-12000, as I try to hit an average of 10‘000 since losing about 5kg in 2021. I definitely could do more high intensity cardio.

February (hearing loss, tinnitus, headaches)
10 month ago I had a sudden hearing loss in my right ear. Got misdiagnosed by my gp and for three weeks begged to go to a specialist, who then immediately realized that I had a Hörsturz (sudden hearing loss). Got perscribed cortisone for about 2 weeks (started higher dosage and every three days lowered it). My hearing in my right ear is gone almost completely and has not returned one bit in the last 10 month. I also have a tinnitus since then and am now pretty sensitive to noise. I avoid big crowds in rooms, even loud restaurants or busy streets overwhelm me now. I become very tired and obviously have a hard time following conversations in these settings, because I cannot understand half of it. 
I also have headaches. 


March-August (MRI, Physio, other stressors)

I had I think 3 appointments with the ear specialist between march and July, and he prescribed me physio therapy for the headaches and an MRI. Ah and we also did a blood test that included some immune disease markers. Everything came back normal.

In july I got scheduled for an MRI to see if it was a tumor. I was cleared, nothing showed up.

Also since july I had 14 appointments with a physio therapist to work on neck, back, jaw muscles, since this could be a contributing factor (as in I guess muscle tension?). I still have headaches and tension in my forehead regularly. 

I also went to my optician and got my glasses checked in august. The ear doctor said strained eyes or a wrong perscription could also be a contributing factor. Got a new perscription and contacts. Nothing too wild he lowered it by a quarter. It felt like he was concerned that he had overcorrected the last time.

Although I personally don‘t belief it was stress related I started meditating and regularly doing anti stress yoga sessions at home. Quit a job that I did not like, but still don‘t belief that was the contributing factor. I still tried to reduce stress and prioritize sleep and even reduced my caffein intake to one coffee/day with some healthy exceptions.

Since the hearing loss I experienced a few different symptoms that I am not sure are related but make me concerned. I have an appointment with a different GP scheduled next week and I am dreading it. I am afraid they will send me home with nothing except a big bill.  

New symptoms:
- pain in my feet and lower legs since about august. Its always in the morning. The pain is in my heel but also in the back of my lower leg. Nothing is visible. It is not debilitating but still concerning me.
- canker sores. Before the sudden hearing loss I had them maybe 5 times in my entire life. Now I get one every other week, sometimes 2-3 at once.
- For about two weeks now I have vision problems in My right eye. Its like I cant focus with it, even with my contacts. Its just my right eye, same side as my ear. 
- the headaches remain. The hearing loss as well, that one probably wont come back. 

Im not a overly anxious person about my health, but it feels like to me, that there is something wrong with me. I mean what else could they check for? I feel like they already did everything and found nothing wrong. I am afraid there is something wrong with my blood circulation or that I had a stroke. Could they have seen that on the MRI? 

Thank you. I hope someone can either help me figure this out or tell me, that I am being overly anxious.
