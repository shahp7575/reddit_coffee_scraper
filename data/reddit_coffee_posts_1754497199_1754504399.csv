I am a very novice woodworker. I completed a few small projects of plywood, MDF, and pine. I am currently following the beginner woodworking online course from Foureyes, Shawn Boyd and Lincoln st and I am at the point of starting on the coffee table, which I want to make out of hardwood. Before I want to do that I want to know what it is like to work with hardwood. So I ordered pre-milled (4 faces) lumber from a reputable source here in the Netherlands for the very first time. I do not own a jointer or a planer. The lumber, being one board of walnut and one board of hard maple arrived today. The walnut looks fine to me but I am hesitant towards the hard maple.

It has some dents/pits and scratches which I believe are not a natural quality of the board or are milling marks. Also the board has a bow of 8mm in the middle and a slight twist. The boards where packed in a way which did not meet my expectation for €100+ worth of lumber and almost €10 shipping cost. I like to hear what all of you think about this board before I contact the supplier.

I want to make at least two edge grain cutting boards out of this so I can get some experience working with this and throw out my bamboo knife-stumpening boards ;)",1,1754504201.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False

1mjc5o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1mjc5o5/careless_coworkers/,Careless coworkers,"Hey everyone I just need some advice on how to deal with careless coworkers.. 

I first worked at starbucks 2021-2022 then worked at a licensed store a few months ago now im working at another licensed store and I just cant seem to avoid careless employees. I dont want to come off as a starbucks die hard employee but why do people get jobs where they simply dont care about their jobs??

For example, I had a coworker make a ladies oatmilk shaken espresso and it looked horrible and obviously the customer complained. All of my coworkers basically trash talked the customer and commented on her physical appearance and when I was asked about the situation I told them the truth, that is was a shitty drink. They got mad at me and gave me the cold shoulder and talked bad about me to coworkers. 

My logic is if someone is paying $7 for a coffee what is so hard about making it correctly? Ive had coworkers make whip cream wrong because ""its just whip cream who cares?"" Or heard ""no I dont care to look up the ingredients for a certain drink because its just coffee they wont tell the difference"" The people I have encountered at both licensed stores have no experience at actual corporate stores so I can see how some things just dont seem important to them, but I am not enjoying going to work everyday and looking like a fool because my coworkers dont care to do things correctly and then having to fix their mistakes (especially during peak) because im the only one who actually knows how to do things correctly.

My manager shares my opinions on this but at the same time he does not want to correct any of these behaviors because of the fear that these employees will quit and that we will be short-staffed. I understand it but at the same time I dont, why do you want to hold onto employees that are essentially running your business into the ground? The whole situation is just super frustrating and I just need advice on what I can do to encourage my fellow coworkers to do their jobs correctly or should I say F it and deal with it?

1mjc58s,https://i.redd.it/z9fv40tuwfhf1.jpeg,"Wild horses, six guns, and tears in my beer at Washoe House Thursdays from 6-9 PM","Our great and mournful nation’s weary blood soaked highways are filled with the ghosts of proud and lonely truckers still crazed from their last yak and run, sweat soaked and choked down with cold and sour 100 mile coffee. Also, the souls of long dead cowhands haunt the Great Plains, weighed forever down by the chains of enduring guilt and a life unfulfilled except with the fleeting joys of sweet poison whiskey and acoustic guitars around a roaring campfire. On nights when the blood moon glares down in judgement like a shining angry skull from the unforgiving sky you can hear the awful sounds of carnally deep and gouging air horns screaming into the night in undying trucker salutes along with the horrible cries of ghostly horsemen calling out to skeletal cattle that are still being driven over and over and over again and who will never reach fresh grass, let alone their eternal reward. Some say that the mountain passes are haunted by the spirits of those who tried their best and did not make it through, hauling rough before the forces of bitterly furious winter storms, whose bones lie yet in the arms of rock falls, tangled with the remains of their teams of horses, wagons, loved ones, and the rotting memories of their respective trades. It may not always great to be a cowboy, but you can never go back, and yet the good times can be ever so sweet.

We’ve all got to go sometime, but in the meantime let’s all go hang out at the famous Washoe House in Petaluma CA every Thursday from 6 to 9 PM for the best goddamn Honky Tonk open mic that ever happened. We’ve got an amazing community of experienced musicians along with newer players making music and joy in one of the most awesome venues in Sonoma County. It’s even so damn great that we even have music that’s NOT COUNTRY (gasp!), a ukulele army, punk rock, singer songwriters, rock and roll, and a little bit of bluegrass now and then. It is a Honky Tonk open mic, and it is also an all-welcoming safe space for everyone to have their time in the spotlight without judgement.  

 

Here’s what’s happening this week at the Washoe House:

 \- Featured act: The Honorable Mr. Glen Earl and Friends

\- The biggest little Kung Fu Cowboy doing a full 15 minutes of all Country material

\- An actual real live believe it or not performance by my favorite local supergroup Calamity John

\- Friendly bartenders and even friendlier drinkers

 

Anyone interested in early sign ups for this open mic can respond to this message or email in. Spots are 15 minutes long and are first come, first served. Respond here or email in for a spot at washoehouseopenmic@gmail.com. If spots are full and you are willing to jump in, bring whatever you have and we’ll try to get you onstage with some other players- many folks there are willing to let people join in on their set. We also have regular cancelations, so there’s always a chance to get onstage. We’ve got a drum kit, a bass amp, a guitar amp, a passion for country music and a desire to bring it to the people. We absolutely look forward seeing you there.",2,1754503969.0,sonomacounty,0,1.0,False

1mjc25h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1mjc25h/dont_know_how_to_overcome_myself/,Don't know how to overcome myself,"First post to public, most of the things in this post I shared only with therapist. I am anxious in doing so but I need an advice. This is long-ish post, apologies for that but I think context is important. This is pretty much the story of me (47M) living together with my BP (49F).

We are 26 years together, have 2 teenage daughters. I am an IT guy she's a psychotherapist. Everyone around us tell how nice we are and what example couple we are. yada yada yada. And every time we stay together with my BP pretty much always I see the pain in her eyes. Sometimes we talk about this, how unfair that is. That we are lying to everyone by pretending how good our life is. Reality is that in good times we are the best. We do a lot of things together, we have coffee every-single-morning for at least an hour. We have things to talk about. Each of us are drawn to each other. But when bad time comes it's like we are strangers, I call it a no-friend-zone. We don't do our morning coffee ritual, we barely speak we interact only when necessary. And after a while (could be a day or few) we have a big talk. The talk always is about The Past. How betrayed she felt then, how insecure she feels now, how she lost trust in my and what she need from me in order to go on. And because I am stupid and self-centric I hear all of that except for the last point. In my head I always reduced her need to not-so-important because I feel bad about how I made her feel. When we talk, somehow I make it all about myself. How bad I feel, how I will try to be better and so on.

We both grew in unhealthy families. Both of us were neglected in one way or another when we were children. We talked about this quite a lot, analyzed where we came from. I actually wasn't thinking about myself too much until one day she said that she did not realized how I was growing up and that this is unimaginable to do to a child. After hearing it for real I started pity myself and be angry at my parents. That is one of my powers or should I say permission-to-do-good-for-me. On the other hand she was neglected no less. She was forced to work in fields, in pain, was constantly mocked and so on. It was unimaginable how we are so different when we came from similar background. She knew what she want to do in her life when she was 7. I did not know what I want to do even before I met her. Anyway, the point of this ramble is that we both are broken or were broken. She somehow found a way to work through it with all the knowledge in therapy and interest in healing herself. While me, the boi-in-mans-body, was enjoying the life as it comes. We talked about how our relationship is unhealthy, that we are in a trauma bond (at the beginning I did not know and only recently realized what that means), yet we stayed together. Her thinking that I will finally give her what she needs and I expecting things to settle, will drown into history and will be forgotten.

Now to the point. I had 7 EA throughout the years, I was addicted to porn which on its own is LTEA. I was addicted to video games where gamers chatting. Although this has nothing to do with any affairs, because I was engaged with other people that was one of big triggers for BP. Last EA one 2.5 years ago. Some of them were in critical times for BP, i.e. before first child, after her father passed away, after she was fired from her job, and so on. In addition to that I was lying thru myself in many occasions. Leaving things out because it's more convenient to me. There's a good quote from J.Peterson's site ""When you have something to say, silence is a lie"". In some cases saying ""no"" when I should say ""yes"".

Speaking of J.Peterson. BP sent me a [video](https://youtu.be/VzUqeuvAcC8) of his book tour where after he presents the ideas from his book he answers some questions on twitter. One of them was, ""This week I discovered my wife was having an affair, I still love her despite the betrayal, how do I navigate this"". In the video she sent me there are two crucial points said (I am paraphrasing them), 1. reveal all the details of the betrayal and 2. do everything to convince that you are trustworthy.

I am having difficulty with the point 1, ""reveal all details of an affair"". And now I am talking about only very last A that was not so long (2.5 years ago).  This is difficult for few reasons. I don't remember all the details, I got scared and shrink when she start asking me questions about particular details, she immediately ""disconnects"" when I say ""I don't remember"" this or that which means our conversation is over now and next time (and there will be one) all of that will repeat. Likely with bigger force. She says that in order for her start caring for herself in our relationship and healing of all betrayal I must be honest and make her feel safe. That makes sense. Yet, when we start talking and I see that our conversation start going into That Direction I change. I squeeze myself into my little shell and do whatever it takes to not be hurt, wether by her anger, rage, sadness, disappointment in my, pity for herself, all of that.

We are at the point where I either tell the truth with all the details or she's out the door. She says he want to see that I **can** be open, honest, vulnerable. She literally has bags packed and I have a week to prove that we can move to the healing.

Some time ago I started working on myself by reading material online, reading books on relationships. They all say the same for the very first step - come clean. I was even considering hypnosis in order to dig up all that is lost. I read a book on IFS (Internal Family Systems) and started working out how to deal with parts of me that prevent me being me.

I need to get it all out. I’ve kept so much of this inside for years- constantly making excuses, trying to be the bigger person, trying to keep the peace. But I’m done.

Let’s call her Karen. She’s technically my cousin, but I’ve called her my sister since we were kids. She and her younger blood sister (let’s call her Christine) moved into my house under foster care when we were young. A year later, their mom passed away. We became a family.

When I moved out at 18, Karen started having issues with my mom (who was her foster parent). Eventually, the foster agency moved her to a new home. Our sister moved in with their grandma. They were split up, but I kept in contact. I came home every summer to visit, including going out of my way to see Karen in her new placements. I even moved back partially to be closer, because I didn’t like that she was going through everything alone.

Fast-forward to adulthood: Karen and I have had blowout fights every year or two, followed by long periods of silence. In the early years, I wasn’t great at managing my emotions and would engage too much. She’d lie, harass me online, twist stories- and I’d lash out. Now, I disengage. But she still spirals.

Over the years, Karen's lying got worse. Christine and I learned not to confront her, because she explodes- full emotional meltdowns. Instead, we’d quietly talk about it between ourselves. Her lies have become so unbelievable, it’s hard to keep track. Often they’re twisted versions of the truth- just enough truth to seem believable, but totally distorted.

I used to drive over an hour, multiple times a week, because she’d call me sobbing about her abusive boyfriend. This happened for *years*. Every time they broke up (which was often), I was the one who showed up. Many times, they were back together before I even arrived. At one point, my boyfriend (now of 6 years) even drove me to pick her up from the police station after she got caught violating a no-contact order she had against him.

One of our big fights started when she called me crying about being homeless and sleeping at a Tim Hortons (which, I'm now sure wasn't the case- she could go home, she was just being dramatic). I said something about her horoscope (trying to relate and offer comfort), and she freaked out- accused me of being insensitive, reminded me I “have a mom” and she doesn’t. But she’s *always* has a place at my mom’s- she just refuses to live under rules like doing chores or not ordering Starbucks and food delivery every day.

After that fight, while we weren’t speaking, she called my mom while she was on vacation and told her I was having ""old men"" over. I was 30, dating someone 20 years older, who she had met and even accepted help from. It was clearly just an attempt to cause chaos. My mom flew home early - money wasted - only to realize Karen was full of it. Just stress and drama, as always.

Eventually, Karen apologized and said she was now on meds. I forgave her, again. She moved in with her new boyfriend to my mom’s house. My mom charged them $600/month total ($430USD, barely anything, and that was only because the boyfriend was moving in as well), but Karen couldn't handle being asked to eat dinner with the family instead of ordering out every day, or to clean up. When confronted, she exploded. Her boyfriend moved back home. She moved into my place- but still dating him.

At my house, she was still seeing her *ex* while with her current boyfriend. She lied about it constantly. Told us to lie to her boyfriend too. The ex was still giving her money while she was getting $2K/month in pandemic aid. She’d spend it by the middle of the month, every month, and become absolutely unbearable.

She refused to follow a budget I helped her make, and got upset when I mentioned it, walking away. She mocked me and my boyfriend constantly until I had to ask her to stop. She threw a tantrum when I asked her to pay for her own weed while Christine was visiting and I was supporting both of them. Literal tantrum- slamming doors, stomping around, raging over something that didn’t even make sense. That’s when she started talking to some guy on Instagram who offered her an apartment in exchange for s\*x once a month.

Now, I was a s\*x worker from 18 to 25- I never judged her for what she chose to do. But she never wanted advice, just handouts. She would say things like, “I’m gonna have to f\*\*k people for money” essentially suggesting if I didn't financially help her, it would be my fault she had to do it. So I stopped reacting. She went through with it, didn’t get the apartment, and got ghosted. Not my problem, she was 26 at this point.

Eventually, she left my place. I don’t even remember how it ended, but she broke up with the new boyfriend and she moved back in with the *ex* again.

Christine then moved in with us while fighting to get her child back from foster care. We found that Karen had trashed the spare room- vomit on the floors from drinking, red hair dye and tattoo ink stained into the wood, and wood trim damage. Never told us when she did it, never cleaned it up herself or offered to fix it. Just left it like that, and later pretended she didn't know. Christine and I cleaned it quietly. We knew confronting her would lead to another breakdown.

For nearly two years, we supported Christine and her son. Built a makeshift wall in our tiny living room to give her kid a bedroom. My partner was diagnosed with epilepsy during that time. Karen was *not* supportive at all. She started fights instead.

On Christmas eve to Christmas day, our power went out. We bundled up and made do. The next day, I went to my mom’s to take care of our dying family cat. Christine must’ve vented to Karen about being cold, because I got SCREAMED at in voicenotes for “abandoning them on Christmas.” Even though I invited them to come with us- and it was *Boxing Day*. Karen was unhinged. Oh- and she screamed all of that into an iPhone we were paying for, which she had only paid two bills out of seven on. Wee gave her a month to transfer the phone plan or return it, and once that month was up and we said we were coming to get the phone, she made a scene. Her boyfriend messaged us harassing us too. When we picked up the phone, we brought her old one back- which was how she had given it to us. She gave us back a phone that looked like it had been whipped out of a moving vehicle. She promised to pay us for the damage. But of course, she never did.

I let her back into my life again after that. This time, at arm’s length. She got a new place with that same boyfriend, but that relationship fell apart again when he cheated on her with a girl he ended up being with. They had gotten a new apartment together, which his mom had cosigned for. When they broke up, she kept the apartment and she was trying to keep him in her life, stating that she only slept with him so that his new gf would see what it felt like to be cheated on. Then she got a new boyfriend which seemed to overlap with her sleeping with the ex. She was still cheating, still playing people. She even texted us “I made an oopsie” after sexting another guy behind her new boyfriend’s back.  
  
She kept asking Christine and I for money, saying it was for groceries or coffee- but we knew she never bought groceries. The amounts she asked for never added up to what she was saying it was for. We constantly felt manipulated. She 'borrowed' $1000 from her grandma and another $1000 from my mom to move again.  Still no budget. Just chaos. She claimed that she just wanted to move, but I'm sure that the ex boyfriend and his mom had forced her to move as she couldn't stay at a place they cosigned. 

Back in March, she asked me why I seemed distant. I told her the truth, in a calm way: that it’s not okay to keep financially draining people who are already struggling. That it’s selfish to expect support but offer nothing in return. That my mom isn’t rich. Christine has a kid. I have my own problems. That I found all the damage she left in my home which she never told me about. And other stuff that isn't worth getting into because it requires me to explain even more about her shitty behaviour. She snapped. Sent me voicenotes saying she “already knows she’s a piece of shit,” playing the victim, and blaming me for not bringing it up sooner. Then she said ""fuck you"" and quickly blocked me before I could respond. Something she always does.

The next day, she posted a photo at my mom’s house with the caption “I win bitch, as per usual.” She also flaunted an expensive skirt that I left at my moms (which my mom had given her not remembering it was mine) on Instagram and has refused to return it since.

Christine recently shared a passive-aggressive quote she posted, obviously directed at me, about how “if you have parents to fall back on, you are EXTREMELY privileged. Don't forget it and don't ever look down on the financial situation of people who don't have that privilege”. As if she doesn't spend her money frivolously on stupid shit like hair extensions multiple times a year, ordering delivery multiple times a day, colouring her hair monthly, getting her nails done, buying things online constantly, going out drinking, etc etc. As if I don't live the life I live because I BUDGET and do not spend frivolously. As if she doesn’t have the same access to support, if not more- she just refuses to follow any of the rules that come with the support. I’ve received help from my family *because I help back*. I picked her up. I drove her to school. I paid her phone. I gave her a home. And I never got anything in return, ever. I honestly cannot say one thing she has ever done for ME. She thinks that I just get given things because I have parents but everything I have ever been given came with a responsibility that she refused to accept. She's honestly the most ungrateful person I know. Ever her own sister, who experienced the same trauma as her, thinks she is ridiculous.

I will note, the help I have received was being given a place to live as an adult (while working for the family business for very little pay, for a job most people don't last a year in), I was given a car at 18 (that could only be sold as a parts car as it couldn't be certified), and I was lent $1000 that I paid back asap. It's not like my rent is paid by them, it's not like they have helped me buy a home. They are not financially well off enough. But even if that was the case, I have also done so much for them. Any time someone needs a ride, or something delivered, or for something to be picked up, I am the go-to. I have always been dependable in that way. I am always offering to help. It's not like the things I have been given come without a responsibility to the family. But she doesn't look at it that way. She expects things to be given to her without any expectation of her having to do anything in return, ever. From me, our family, from her boyfriends. She's a user.

Oh and for the record, she never paid back that $2000 she 'borrowed'. My mom tried to get her to help clean the house to pay it back, and that lasted about a week. She only went as a means to rub it in my face and talk shit about me to my mom, which my mom shut down. 

Christine went through worse in the system and doesn’t victimize herself the way Karen does. That’s how I know- it’s not just trauma. It’s *her*. She is almost 30 and still acting the same way she did at 16. 

I’m done.

TLDR; I considered my cousin a sister after she and her younger sibling came into foster care with us as kids. Despite years of trying to support her- emotionally, financially, and even giving her a place to live- she’s repeatedly lied, manipulated, used people, destroyed my property, refused accountability, and played the victim. She constantly asked to borrow money she never repaid, trashed my home, caused endless drama, and lashed out whenever anyone tried to set boundaries. Her younger sister went through worse and grew up. She didn’t. I’ve finally cut her off, and I feel sad but relieved.",2,1754503558.0,family,1,1.0,False

I understand there are gyms for less than that, but this one is what I prefer due to location and equipment.

But here’s what I don’t get. Many of these are same people that spend hundreds on junk food, alcohol, random parties, and takeout every month without a second thought.

They also ask if I spend a lot on food since I eat a high-protein diet, but honestly, I don’t think it’s crazy expensive. I cook most of my meals at home, don’t eat out unless absolutely necessary, and I don’t even drink coffee (just never liked it).

I guess I’m wondering if is it really about the money, or just about what people prioritize?

Curious to hear what others think.

Edit : Yes, It’s expensive than the average ones, but it’s very close to my home, just a quick 10 minute walk and saves me alot of time in all the traffic. Whenever I get an hour of free time, I go.

1mjbvhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mjbvhu/delve_into_the_best_masticating_juicer_omega/,Delve Into the Best Masticating Juicer Omega NC900HRD19 and See If It’s Worth It,"Finding the perfect juicer for maintaining a healthy lifestyle can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Recently, I had the chance to try out the Omega NC900HRD19, and using it has been quite the experience. Featuring a robust masticating mechanism, this appliance makes juicing fruits, vegetables, and wheatgrass not just simple but almost therapeutic. Over the past few weeks, this juicer turned into a morning ritual, helping me get my daily nutrient-packed juice with minimal fuss.

**Ease of Use and Thoughtful Design**  
From the moment I unboxed this juicer, its build quality and mechanism stood out. Its sleek red finish enhances the aesthetic of any modern kitchen—it certainly did mine. The larger feed chute is an absolute blessing. Compared to older Omega models, the less prep time felt like a breakthrough; larger fruit pieces could be added without endlessly chopping. The adjustable pressure settings allowed me to extract maximum juice from anything I threw at it, whether it was oranges, leafy greens, or oddly enough, even carrots. Clean-up, which is the most dreaded part of juicing, was surprisingly straightforward. Although it requires handwashing, the parts are easy to disassemble and rinse.

**Performance That Impresses**  
This juicer runs at a low speed of 80 RPM, which might make you think it’s slow, but it’s designed for minimal heat buildup. No oxidation means the enzymes remain intact, and the taste speaks volumes about this thoughtful engineering. My carrot-ginger mix tasted fresher than other machines I’ve used in the past. The juices also didn’t separate as quickly, which speaks to the claim of ""longer-lasting juices."" The 150-watt motor is quietly powerful, handling even tough ingredients without sounding like a lawnmower. The auto-pulp ejection allowed continuous juicing without constant stops, something I truly appreciated on busy mornings.

[Check Omega NC900HRD19 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b09ffxrblb/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Exceptional nutrient retention due to low RPM and minimal heat.  
- Large feed chute reduces prep time.  
- Quiet operation, perfect for early mornings.  
- Multi-functionality with accessories for pasta, nut butters, frothed soy milk, and more.

**Critiques**  
- At 18.7 pounds, it’s not the lightest appliance to move around.  
- A single speed might limit customization for certain textures.  
- Hand-wash instructions may dissuade those who’d prefer dishwasher-compatible parts.  

**Good Points**  
The flexibility of the machine extends beyond juicing. While I initially focussed on squeezing fresh veggies and fruits, I later discovered its potential for nut milks and frozen dessert creation. Being able to grind coffee beans and whip up herb mixtures has earned this appliance permanent counter space in my kitchen. Moreover, the 15-year parts and performance warranty speaks volumes about Omega’s confidence in their product. Even minor issues feel less significant with this kind of long-term commitment.

**Areas of Concern**  
While I generally appreciated its compact footprint, the heaviness of the unit made relocating or storing it a bit inconvenient, especially in smaller kitchens. The manual cleaning requirement could also feel cumbersome after frequent use. And, although it’s functional in many ways, seasoned juicing enthusiasts might crave more speed settings for unique recipes.

**Market Rivals**  
Looking at rivals, the Omega NC900HRD19 stands tall against traditional juicers like the Hurom H101 or Breville Juice Fountain. Unlike centrifugal juicers, the Omega juicer extracts juice with a cool, slow press, which prevents nutrient loss—a distinct advantage over some competitors. Hurom’s models often match in efficiency but come at a heftier price, while Breville designs are undeniably faster but generate excess heat, compromising freshness. Ultimately, if nutrient retention is a priority, this masticating machine carves out its own space within the category.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given its multi-functional capabilities, long-lasting design, and the brand's extensive 15-year warranty, I felt that its price aligns with its features. While some may view it as an investment upfront, the durability and versatility reduce long-term costs since fewer appliances are needed for tasks this machine handles with ease. For those seriously considering a healthier lifestyle, this juicer is worth every penny in terms of quality and longevity.

In a couple of weeks, I’m heading off to college and am gonna be rooming with my cousin, and recently, we’ve been coming up with various business ideas to run from our dorm lol. Because we both like coffee, we initially thought an espresso business might be a good idea since I recently got a cheap machine. Though, it’s loud and can really only make one at a time, and my machine is quite annoying. So scratch that.

However, I was thinking about cold brew. More specifically, how much I personally like it, and how cheap, and how easy it is to make at home. After doing the math I found that a good strong cold brew costs about 60 cents a cup to make. Plus it can just sit in the fridge!! So essentially, I was thinking that this might be the perfect drink to sell from a dorm.

The coffee shops around campus, while nice, are quite overpriced. And with many students likely wanting coffee every morning but also being broke, I’d be happy to sell them at 2-3 dollars a cup. (I don’t have to make a huge profit, I just wanna dip my toes into the business world).

Am I being overly ambitious or thinking too wishfully? Let me know. I want to SPECIALIZE into cold brew, and not really go into hot coffee as much. I think doing so would be more efficient than expanding my horizons too early on. We’d sell smooth cold brew, with cream and sugar should someone want it, and really not much more- at least for the time being.

What do you all think? Do all business majors think they’ve got a good idea until they put it into practice? This is all speculation for now. What experiences do you have? Any advice you can give me? Thanks.",1,1754503281.0,Businessideas,0,1.0,False
1mjbup9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/1mjbup9/outdoor_smoking/,Outdoor Smoking,"Who actually owns Main Street Station, the general property? I have a multilayered discussion topic. My boyfriend and I were at South Main Street Station after purchasing coffees/lattes at Afternoon. My boyfriend smokes, and there was literally no one else around except one of the owners of Akira Wood who was really far away from us, and a woman who looked like she fell out of a Land's End catalogue with him, never seen her before in my life even though I live in the area and go to this coffee shop everyday since it opened.

Basically, she came over and told my boyfriend to stop smoking. I found this irritating because literally no one else was there. My first reaction was.. does this woman even work here? Is she somehow affiliated AT ALL with any of the businesses? My second was, if she is- could she even make us leave, legally?

And, I'm saying this as a former smoker who no longer wants to be around cigarette smoke and knows the health implications of second hand smoke but.. I frankly think the rule is kind of ridiculous and she was mostly being classist.

Here are my reasons for thinking enforcing smoking are ridiculous in our current times:

\-Cars exist and emissions from cars take two years off of everyone's lives and this business location is next to a road.

\-The plastic furniture they purchased for the outside area smells like shit because it's off-gassing soft plastics that are in the sun and those fumes are 100% carcinogenic.

\-This particular business area has a literal ROOM full of air conditioners running all the time which contribute to climate change, which worsens air quality.

\-The businesses in the plaza offer plastic takeaway cups/containers which are made at fossil fuel refineries which cause air pollution, are complicit in environmental racism, and are responsible for mercury falling into the ocean and getting into our fish/food supply. Plastic production causes air pollution and so does plastic recycling or plastic incineration when landfills are not an option for disposal.

\-Somehow businesses never seem to do anything when people vape indoors in my face, or even more disgustingly, in bathrooms.

\-When Steamers existed one of the employees started spray painting right next to me without warning.

\-The city uses RoundUp on public area plants, parks and around people while they are walking in town.

\-Heartwood just cut down a huge oak tree.

\-Cemex is just up the street and cement plants contribute to air pollution.

Not to mention what I would call a variety of air pollutants I'm unwillingly subjected to everyday such as by: guys who are cutting bricks or cement with a saw and the dust is literally everywhere, car exhaust from car-drivers while I'm on my bike, my neighbor spraying some horrible cleaner inside of a fridge to clean it and stinking up our apartment complex for days, restaurants using Fabuloso which is full of horrible chemicals.

I just think there are so many air quality and health issues happening on such a large scale that people do nothing about, and yet my boyfriend having a cigarette made this woman come over to us and bother us.

Don't even get me started on how wealthy people are ruining the climate and human health.

This incident just gave me a bad taste in my mouth because if I'm giving your business district money you should leave me well enough alone if we're not bothering anyone. It just seemed like she was lording over things with one of the business owners, and wanted walk over 100 feet to lord over us, too.

Top Reasons and How to Fix Them!,"Let me give you an example: Imagine you own a coffee shop, and you notice many customers don't stay at their tables — they leave quickly. But you don't know why. Is the seating uncomfortable? Is the menu confusing? In the digital world, the situation is very similar. We can't directly see where users get stuck or why they leave your website halfway through their purchase. This is where User Behavior Analytics comes into play.

User Behavior Analytics works like a hidden camera inside your site or app, showing you exactly what your users do: where they click, how far they scroll, and most importantly, where they get frustrated and leave. For instance, customers on one e-commerce site I collaborated with repeatedly entered their email address on the form, only to remove it right after! I made modifications when I saw the design was perplexing, and the rate of buy fulfillment increased significantly.

Several key tools help us discover these insights:

* Session Recording: This tool records users' mouse movements and clicks like a video, allowing us to pinpoint exactly where problems occur.
* Heatmaps: Heatmaps show which areas of a page get the most clicks and scrolls through colorful overlays. For instance, I once discovered that the ""Buy Now"" button was placed too low on the page, so many users didn't even notice it. After moving it higher, sales increased.
* Funnels: Funnels reveal at which step users drop out during the purchase or signup process. This helps target specific pain points directly.

By analyzing this data, we learn which buttons get the most attention, where users get confused, and which parts of the site truly engage visitors. This understanding enables us to streamline pages, enhance the user experience, and provide users with a more seamless journey. Knowing that we're improving the user experience helps one to feel accomplished through this path of development.

Yesterday, I matched with a girl on Happn. Her name was *Kavya*. She claimed to be from **Ranchi**, living in **Viman Nagar, Pune** since 2019, and working for **TCS**. She told me she had done her [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) from **MIT-WPU** and was soon going to join the **cabin crew** industry.

We decided to meet. She came all the way to **Phoenix Mall**, where my office is, and waited for me for almost 30 minutes. She even brought flowers for me, which felt sweet and genuine. We had a great conversation and went for coffee at **Tim Hortons**. Everything seemed to be going really well.

Later, we planned to watch a movie. Just before that, she suddenly created a scene saying her sister was stuck in **Manali** and needed urgent help. To make it look real, she had a phone call in front of me, pretending to talk to her sister.

She then tried sending ₹10,000 to her via Google Pay, but claimed there was some server error. Since she was with me and seemed genuine, I agreed to help and transferred the amount from my end.

After that, she said she needed to go back to her flat quickly to change for the movie. She actually came back and we watched a late-night show of *Saayira*. Everything still seemed fine.

Before leaving, she said, *“Let’s meet again tomorrow morning.”*  
But the next morning — **I was blocked everywhere.**  
Her number is unreachable. All communication is gone. No trace.

When I shared this with a friend, he told me that such scams are becoming common on dating apps. What shocks me is that her **profile was verified**, and she was **well-spoken, polite, and seemed educated**.

I can’t stop what happened to me, but maybe someone else can be saved. Just wanted to raise awareness.

**Details I gathered from her:**

* Name: Kavya (possibly fake)
* From: Ranchi
* Living in: Viman Nagar, Pune (near Phoenix Mall)
* Works at: TCS
* Education: [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) from MIT-WPU

Here’s the post, adapted for a general productivity and non-fiction reading audience:

**Title:** How I Finally Remember What I Read—Simple Routine That Actually Works (Especially for Non-Fiction & Productivity Books)

If you love reading non-fiction or productivity books, but your shelf (digital or physical) is full of titles you barely remember, you’re definitely not alone. For years, I’d read something inspiring, highlight a ton, and… two weeks later, I’d already forgotten the best ideas. Recently, I started a new routine that actually helps the good stuff stick with me, and I wanted to share in case anyone else is tired of “reading and forgetting.”

What made the difference:
I started mixing spaced repetition with daily reviews. Highlighting is step one, but the secret sauce is regularly *seeing and using* those gems so they stick and actually show up in my work—or even just in conversation.

Here’s what I do:
- As I read, I highlight quotes, strategies, summaries—anything that I find valuable or want to experiment with.
- When I’ve finished (or even midway), I export my highlights from my reading app or device. Some apps let you email them to yourself; with Kindle, for example, you can use the “Your Highlights” page.
- For reviews, I use apps like Readwise (which syncs directly and sends you daily highlight reviews by email or app) or Readingpal.me (a similar tool to organize and review your non-fiction book highlights using spaced repetition, AI with WhatsApp). Both make it easy to actually remember what you read. If you want extra control, Anki lets you make totally customizable digital flashcards from any book highlights.
- Each morning, I quickly review a few highlights—takes me only a few minutes over coffee, but it’s been enough for old ideas to pop up right when I need them.

Pro tips for fellow productivity/non-fiction readers:
- Don’t just highlight—consider rewording your top highlights into quick questions or actionable steps (“How can I use this habit in my routine?”). It forces you to actually remember and try things, not just collect quotes.
- Start with books that matter most to you—don’t make it a chore for every book.
- Steady daily (or near-daily) reviews are more powerful than one massive review session every few weeks.

Honestly, I’m surprised how much more valuable reading feels now. Instead of books being one-time inspiration, the best lessons actually become part of my life and workflow. And those highlight export/review features make it simple to get started—no technical skills needed.

Curious if anyone else in the productivity or non-fiction world has routines for making books stick? Any favorite tools I might be missing?

There’s something about that gap of time between getting ready for bed, and sleeping. I don’t know about you, but I used to keep a light on in my room. Just the monitor on my computer, in case I needed to get up to do something in the middle of the night. Last month, the computer died on me, so I’ve been getting used to sleeping in the dark. 

If you focus on the room around you too much, your brain starts to try to make sense of the faint shapes around you, imagining things that aren’t there. It’s basically your brain’s way of trying to test you, I think. A long unneeded mechanism our ancestors used to keep themselves safe. Aka, kind of useless for the modern era. 

I toss and turn a lot during this gap of time. My body naturally likes to face my room, and then it feels overstimulated and turns to face the wall next to my bed. I’ve heard a lot of people poke fun at how many of us seem to prefer turning our backs while we sleep and ending up looking incredibly vulnerable. A total flaw in the way we’re wired as a species. I don’t blame them, but at the same time, it feels nice to be able to look at nothing. To be embraced in the feeling of not having to participate in the world for a short bit of time. 

A few weeks ago, at work, I was cleaning up the registers after closing. I’ve gotten pretty used to working in the quiet, watching coworkers trickle out of the exit at a safe distance. I was sweeping under a register, when I heard a voice come from behind softly telling me;

“I’m right behind you” 

as the source of the voice walked inches past me. I froze up for a second, up until I realized it was Derick from eyewear. Fucking Derick. Needless to say, I’ve never really been good with surprise contact. I don’t really scream or jump usually, I just freeze up but never really say anything. It feels like the equivalent of someone spitting in my mouth. I feel gross and like I want to take a shower just by someone touching my back. Unfortunately, when you work in retail, it’s a regular occurrence. 

Not always by coworkers, but by customers most of the time. It’s usually the older folks. Folks who think you did a good job and want to pat you on the back, or walk past you to use the shitter, and think they’re being nice by touching your shoulder while you’re preoccupied at the register. It’s hyperbolic, but I just want to cry or scream when someone does that. Nothing comes out, not even if I wanted to, I’d probably be out of a job if I did, but I guess I’m just happy it’s less of a custom with younger generations. I also understand that people tend to just do it without knowing, ergo, why I hesitate to really say anything.

I’m happy to go to sleep. I’ll come back from work, eat something, pet my dog, then go to my room, lock the door, strip out of my second skin, and sleep like a baby. Lately though, it feels as though the fabric of time between getting in my bed, and sleeping is getting stretched. I’ll stare up at the faint shapes of the paper stars I hung from my ceiling, swaying from the box fan, hear the soft humming of my air purifier chugging along, and my brain goes to mush. That is, up until I realize how shallow my breaths are. I’ll break out of my sleep just to try and take deeper breaths, it just feels like there’s this weight on me. It gets heavier each night. Not by much, but it almost feels like a cat’s sitting on my chest sometimes.

Any added weight on me just makes it feel worse, up to the point that I only sleep with a blanket as thin as tissue paper. I used to sleep in tanks, but now I just sleep in boxers to make it slightly easier on my lungs. I used to sleep, as I said, facing my room, then turning to face my wall, but now, I’ve added a third step by lastly laying on my back. When I sleep on my side, the weight of my arm feels suffocating. It feels as if I were to let myself sleep, I would just stop breathing by the morning. 

By the time I finally get to sleep, I typically end up waking up during the middle of the night, and the cycle starts again. I used to be able to fall back asleep pretty easily, but more and more often, I hear things from my dreams before I wake up. Scraping sounds, loud stomps, as if someone jumped as harshly as they could on my floor, the sounds of someone crying from the other end of the room. I’ll look wide eyed at the ceiling, frozen, before I assure myself it was a dream and fall back to sleep. Come morning, it feels like I can barely breathe up until I can use my inhaler for some sweet respite. 

My dog typically likes to sleep in his own little corner in the living room. He’s a good boy, likes his space as much as I like mine. As of late, he’s gotten more anxious. He follows me to my bedroom at night, like he wants to come with, but knows it’s not our rules. I’ll find him curled up by my door come morning. As much as I’d like to bring him in, I know he’d just paw at the door during the middle of the night to go out. It just wouldn’t be a good fit for either of us. 

Last week, another voice came from my dream at night. 

“I’m right behind you”

The same tone and infliction as how my coworker had said it before. Thus, the same reaction. Freeze, pause, assurance, sleep. Come morning, I checked in with a doctor since I worried it could be a heart or lung issue, but as shit as my lungs are, doc said they’re in perfectly fine working order. Did you know that inhalers are pretty much just breathable steroids? I had no idea up until then. Doesn’t stop me from taking them though. Even spent a good chunk of money on one of those sleep studies, records came clean. I’m apparently “as fit as a horse” as far as they’re concerned. 

Three days ago, the same cycle.

 “…to sleep.” 

Freeze, pause… It felt different that night from nights where I felt certain I was alone in my room. It felt sickenly familiar to me. The heavy weight on my chest, the breathing down my face. I used to dream of this night. Fantasizing about what I would do if I woke up to a man in my bed again. How I would bite the tongue that found its way into my mouth, strangle him, beat him silly. But I lay frozen again. Feeling the motions of this presence sitting on my chest, breathing down my face, my own chest straining to get air in. The air in the room smelt sick, like cigarette smoke and piss. It felt indescribably wet and sticky. Despite only seeing the lack of things I was normally able to make out in normal light, my eyes were wide, trying to make anything out, wanting to make any sense of what I was feeling on top of me. 

If it wasn’t for Sadie scratching on the other side of my door, I don’t know where I would have been. Probably not writing this right now. Knowing he was behind there, it gave me a weird sense of security. I knew we were both fucked, but it gave me the courage to close my eyes again. Not like they were of any use anyways right now. It was comfortable to try and convince myself that it was just like any other night from before. I steadied my breath, as the sensations began to mix with the overwhelming sound of him scratching. It sounded like television static, in a way. Despite the thoughts still rushing through my head on if I was going to die then and there, I was finally able to find some peace, and lull myself back into a state of sleep. Only hoping I didn’t have to face something worse than death in the morning. 

Come morning, light crept through my curtains, showing me the beautiful sight that was; no one in my room. Despite feeling uncertain on whether or not what I felt was a vivid fever dream, or some kind of sleep paralysis, I stumbled out of bed so I could open the door and hug Sadie. He was a good boy. I ended up calling in sick to work that day solely to think of a game plan, and to pamper my dog silly.

I checked my entire room for any possible points of forced entry. Door had still been locked, window was locked, nothing in the closet or under my bed. Everything was left just as messy as it had been. Nothing was stolen from my fridge, silverware drawer, or any valuables. The apartment complex I live in is generally a pretty middling area, nothing extremely impoverished, but not really thriving either. Despite wanting to rule it off as a dream then and there, I went to consider my options, at least to make myself feel more secure. First off, I scraped my brain for people who would be willing to have an impromptu sleepover on a Tuesday night. 

I didn’t know any of my coworkers well enough to ask for that kind of favor, the only coworker I had even visited outside of work before was only due to handing off a Cirsium Zorba poster. Most of my friends were online, hundreds of miles away, and the ones I did know were primarily former high school friends I hadn’t talked to in months. Only now, did I realize how isolated I made myself. It wasn’t like I didn’t try. I tried to keep friendships going before all of this happened, it just felt like I was the only one who kept the wheel turning, or I’d regret meeting them in the first place. 

Maybe I could buy a hotel room for the night, at least for a change of scenery. Sleeping in hotels felt like a sensory hellscape for me, but it was either that, or sleep with a night light and a gun like a 9 year old with the intent to kill Mike Wazouski. I had also considered the option of simply powering through and not sleeping the next night. At this point, I was already feeling sleep deprived to begin with, I didn’t want to use any more of my PTO, and I seriously doubted my ability to stay up that long. Even then, I figured, fuck it. I don’t have much to lose. What’s $93 down the sink for a pet friendly hotel room and 4 Red Bulls going to hurt? It’ll at least give me some sense of peace. 

The hotel itself looked, while yes, cheap, moderately clean and secure enough to make me feel alright. Sadie was anxious, I don’t really blame him, but he was being a very brave boy... I love him so much. Checking into the hotel, Sadie at my side, everything had been normal, all things considered. Given it was a Tuesday, the main crowd in the lobby were a handful of tired people in suits. After paying the receptionist, being handed my key, I felt the familiar chill run up my spine as a hand weighed itself down on my shoulder. 

“Yeah, excuse me, but toilet’s clogged in my room.” 

The voice came from behind me to tell the receptionist. I froze again. Fantasizing about body slamming this guy into the lobby’s coffee table. 

“I’ll get someone to look at it… what room are you in?” 

The exhausted woman at the reception desk asked

“403. Thanks.” 

He took his hand off of me and left. Of course, it had to be a room neighboring mine. I almost considered asking for a different room, but ultimately chose not to. Despite that sour milk of an experience, I made my way to my room soon after. Getting me and Sadie settled, I went to secure my room. The door had two locks, windows weren’t able to be opened even if you wanted them open, bathroom was clear, closet was clear. With that, I unpacked my things and tried my best to unwind with my impromptu day off. 
 
Spent the first few hours talking to friends online. I’d told them about what had happened, though, only that it was a super vivid dream. I worried about coming off as a psycho if I told them I doubted it being a dream. It wasn’t surprising to hear they suggested I get a sleep study done, the typical types of comments for what I had been experiencing. It was irksome to hear the same things, but I guess I was just happy to have some people looking out for me. 

Took Sadie on a few walks later on, not wanting him to have an accident later at night. Outside of the hotel was your standard fanfare of the Midwest. Kwick trip where I picked up some food, business park, old church. I joked to myself about getting some holy water for the road. 

Bunkering myself down for the rest of the night, making sure I double locked my room, I was able to spend some more time shooting the shit with the guys. When most of them went to bed, I put on a movie to muffle out the sounds of the next room over. Sadie had curled up in his makeshift “bed” I set up with him from towels and blankets. By my third redbull, 2 AM, I felt pretty confident I’d be able to make it through the entire night like this. At least up until morning. 

Deciding to binge the Vampire hunter D series, I’d set the 1985 movie on my television. Sitting back in bed and watching it, I listened to the movie, occasionally mimicking the cheesiness of the dub every now and then when it was warranted. 

“I’m not the one they say was nibbled on by the count.” 

In a bad southern drawl. 

“She’s in cahoots with the vampires ah can’t sell to.” 

Gruffer in tone. 

I was about half way through a bag of sour gummy worms, when something went near my peripheral. Thinking it was Sadie, I glanced over to see something that’s been ingrained in my head ever since last night. It was the man from the night before. I had never seen him, given how dark it had been, but I felt certain it was him. I don’t even know if I could call it a man, but the way it stood on 2 feet and wore clothes made it seem to consider it one of us. 

It wore tattered pants and a hoodie. Blood scabbed over both articles like dirt as it loosely held a gutting knife. He smelt even worse from the night before. I’d like to consider myself relatively tall, but it felt like it towered in size, inches away from the ceiling. Its hair was dark, greasy and matted. Its face was pale, like layers of layers of dead rotting skin had been grafted onto its face, making its unblinking eyes look small and far away. I don’t know if the worst detail was its eyes or mouth. Through the tunnels of skin burrowed pale blue eyes, almost looking blind and shriveled. The mouth had little to no lips to speak of, all 32 teeth on display as fresh blood pooled out of its mouth into a taunting grin. I felt certain whatever this thing is, if it ever was human, wasn’t human in any sense of the word anymore. 

I soon regretted choosing to be in a well lit room that night. At least in the dark, I didn’t have to see this. He stood still for a moment, as if my petrified stare was able to keep him in stone. That was, until he finally walked towards my bed. Frozen again, I felt like anything I did to defend myself would be useless right now. Sadie got up from his bed and started barking. I hoped and prayed the thing would just ignore him. I felt like a coward. I was a coward just to lay there. 

Climbing onto the bed, the thing climbed over me, unidentifiable liquids dripping from its clothing onto my body before it finally took a seat on my chest, never keeping its gaze away from mine. Once it made a home there, it finally spoke in full wet clarity. 

“Go to sleep.” 

An insane request by a mindless creature. Instead, I stared the thing down, heart pounding in my chest as Sadie kept up his barking from the right side of the bed. Minutes felt like hours as my mind raced, unable to keep my gaze off of it, as though that was the only thing stopping it from harming me. It was going to kill me, I felt certain of it, and yet, it stayed still. The smell soaked into the room around me. I felt nauseated. How did this thing get here? I felt certain that the door never opened, there wasn’t any way it could have gone through the window without breaking it. Did it just… appear? It was and still is the only logic I could make of it. 

As the minutes passed on and we continued our staring game, I began to genuinely think the only way this thing would leave my sight was if I did go to sleep. I didn’t dare move an inch. Calming my breathing, taking deep breaths, I tried to relax myself enough to try and convince myself to sleep. Its face still bore down on me, the only peace I could give myself was to stare at its abdomen, even if I knew it was still staring me down. Its nails were glued to the bed, caked in unknown muck. The more I looked at this thing, the more I wanted to lose my lunch.

Sadie’s barking eventually calmed down, even then, he seemed to be on guard of this stranger. He was never exactly a guard dog in any sense. I didn’t expect him to be my guard dog, bite off this thing’s leg or anything as much as I wished he might. Just before I was able to hype myself up enough to close my eyes, it moved. God, it moved. 

The shriveled orbs that had once stared at me turned to the right side of the bed, back lurching to stare at Sadie. It stared at him for just a moment until it returned its gaze back to me. 

“I’ll kill your dog tomorrow night, bitch.” 

All I felt was rage in my body. I knew I had every ounce of control to be able to throw a punch at him and ten more, and yet, I was a coward. I was a fucking coward. 

“I’ll gut him open. Make it go as long as possible.” 

It felt surreal to hear it speak. Despite having essentially no lips, it was able to pronounce the words perfectly. Kind of like when you hear a bird “talk”. Even the way he said the word bitch, it had no malice in it. The tone held nothing.

“We have fun.”

It leaned down closer at my face. I could smell its breath yet again. It smelt like old death. The blood around his mouth still looked fresh, at a constant pace as the blood trickled down him and onto me. If I was a good honest person who cared about my dog, I would have jumped him then and there. Even if I died, I would have at least known I died with some dignity. 

Instead, I did my best to calm myself down again. Convincing myself in some way that his threats were hollow. After all, if it was able to, it could have done it then and there. Why wait? It felt like it was trying to egg me on, to get a reaction out of me. If I managed to sleep, maybe I would wake up, and it would all be a dream. It would all be a nightmare. I could hug my dog, Sadie would be fine if I just went to sleep. I’d die for nothing if I didn’t even do that right. That much felt clear to me. 

With that, I found it in myself to close my eyes again. Bracing myself for a moment, afraid to feel any shifting of the bed. Instead, it was completely still. The movie was still going on in the back. I tried to use that sound to mask off the stench, the sensation of something still dripping on me, the heavy breathing, just everything. That was, until I felt something grace my cheek. It felt warm, wet, and bumpy. Thin and bendable, like a tongue. It traced along my check, up my forehead, down my other cheek, and down my jaw to make a full circle. As if it was getting ready to peel my face off to wear as its own. I wanted to cry. 

After making a full circle, it changed course, tracing across my face, past the bridge of my nose, up my eyelid to my forehead, and back down to my other eyelid. My entire face smelt like iron and bad garlic, a smell that was impossible to ignore. I wanted to scream, disappear, be anywhere but there. I never want to go back to that place again. Despite my added setbacks that night, the squishy feeling on my face like I just freshly dunked my face into a bucket of hotdog water, I was able to pull myself away. 

As sad as it is to admit, it’s a talent I’ve always had. Just to pretend like my world isn’t falling around me. Just to ignore it all. The creatures’ taunting, incomprehensible now, sounding more like an animal had melded into the movie’s audio. Taking calculated breaths, despite the crushing feeling on my chest, my mind gently lulled itself to sleep, one careful step at a time. I thought about the nights I couldn’t sleep as a kid. I’d walk into my parents bedroom, climb between them, and my mom would pull me in for an embrace. She would hum to me in her arms. I’d hold onto her like one of those cubs you’d see in a nature documentary. 

As I thought about the song she’d sing, it began; 

“Little child, be not afraid.
Though wind makes creatures of our trees
And their branches to hands, they’re not real, understand, 
I am here tonight.” 

A tone devoid of any melody that the song was meant to go in, as if it was reading it off of a script. It made my blood run cold to hear her words get trampled. 

“And someday you’ll know
That nature is so
The same rain that draws you near me 
Falls on rivers and land 
On forests and sand
Makes the beautiful world that you’ll see 
In the morning” 

My mind wanted to think about anything else, anything to make it stop, and yet the words echoing from its voice box, it continued. 

“For you know, once even I was a little child, and I was afraid.
But a gentle someone always came 
To dry all my tears, trade sweet sleep for fears 
And to give a kiss goodnight. 
Well now I am grown
And these years have shown
That rain’s a part of how life goes 
But it’s dark and it’s late 
So I’ll hold you and wait 
‘Till your frightened eyes do close” 

The words felt like a mockery of what my existence had come to. It almost felt like some sort of phoned confession of it, if I didn’t already know it was just eating off what I knew. 

“And I hope that you’ll know
That nature is so
The same rain that draws you near me
Falls on river and land 
On forests and sand 
Makes the beautiful world that you’ll see 
In the morning. 
Everything’s fine in the morning. 
The rain’ll be gone in the morning. 
But I’ll still be here in the morning.” 

Finally, silence. Cold, dead silence. The liquid had finally felt like nothing now. I was slightly more acclimated to the smell, not by much, but enough to only give me a headache. I didn’t think it knew the words it was saying, I don’t know if that made me feel better or worse, but I felt numb enough to find myself somewhere in REM. The fact that the song helped me sleep better in some small sense felt like yet another glob of spit into the mouth. 

By the time I was awake, it was morning. Sadie had been scratching at the hotel’s door like crazy. I felt like I wanted to sleep the rest of the day away, until memories of last night flooded back and I bolted awake. I looked down to find my body clean, nothing had any signs of anything having leaked onto me as I yet again questioned if what I saw was a dream. It felt nice to pretend like it was one if it wasn’t for the threats to my dog, or how nothing added perfectly to either camp for me. Regardless, I checked out and took my dog back home and for a walk. On the car ride home, as sad as it is to admit, when “Wake me up before you go go” had started playing on the radio, I just burst into hysterical tears.  

After thinking things through, I’ve decided to write and post my experience here. If I’m wrong and this all was some dream, then I can consider this nothing more than some poor man’s attempt at a dream diary. That’s the best ending I can only hope for. If my concerns are right… I’ll have written everything here so people at least know what happened. Sadie is all I have left. I can’t bear to send him off to a shelter, as selfish as it is. I’ll see if my coworker can look after him for a night. As paranoid as I may be, I’ll do what I can to make sure the creature’s words don’t become reality. 

I don’t want to die a coward. It’s easy to say you’ll just punch someone if the reason arises. It’s easy for many people to do. I wish I was like that, I really do. I don’t know how well it eats lead, but I’m willing to give it a shot if it means saving another person from this hellscape. Lastly, I’m sorry Alex. If I don’t wake up tomorrow, I can only hope you’ll forgive me one day.

Hope your mid-semester exams are going well. Wishing everyone good luck with the rest of your papers.

I’m a visually impaired student from the Central Campus. Life here is busy, and while I try to keep up with everything, there are times I just feel the need to step out , maybe for a quiet walk, a cup of coffee, or just to breathe for a while outside the walls of my room.

But being honest, I find it really hard to do that alone. Navigating the campus and out of it isn't always easy, and not many are willing to come along. Maybe they see me as a burden, or maybe they just don't know how to respond. Either way, I haven’t been able to make many friends here, and that feeling of being left out sometimes gets heavy.

I’m not looking for sympathy, just a little kindness. A few people who don’t mind walking slowly, chatting, or simply being around without judgment. Someone who understands that even small gestures  like waiting, guiding, or just being present  can mean a lot to someone like me.

If you’re someone who believes in being there for others or just feel like having a genuine connection beyond the usual college rush, I’d be really grateful to connect.

Feel free to message me if this speaks to you in any way. Thanks for reading this, and all the best for your exams.

Take care,

I’m looking to buy a solid manual coffee grinder. Right now, I’m mainly going to use it for French Press, but in the future, I’d like to get into espresso as well so I’d prefer something that can handle both, even if I won’t use the espresso setting immediately.

What I’m really looking for is something sturdy and long-lasting. I want it to feel heavy and well-built, not something that’ll break or wear down in a year or two. Ideally something that’ll last me 3 to 5 years without issues.

My budget is around ₹15,000, but I’m okay with stretching it a bit if it’s truly worth it. Also, I can buy from the US if a better option is available there, not limited to just Indian sellers.

I’ve heard names like 1Zpresso, Timemore, and Kinu being thrown around, but I’m honestly a bit confused with all the model options and what’s actually good value for money.

1mjbgz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mjbgz0/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_for_offices/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker for Offices Keurig K1500 Review,"Brewing coffee has always been as much about the routine as it is about the flavor for me, and the Keurig K1500 certainly promised to simplify my mornings while delivering consistently satisfying cups of joe. Advertised as an excellent choice for small businesses with features like a STRONG brew button, a massive water reservoir, and Quiet Brew Technology, I was curious to see how this machine would integrate into my kitchen routine. Testing this coffee maker over several weeks, I’ve gathered insights—both the commendable highlights and its few quirks—that I’m eager to share.

**Thoughtful Design and Build**  
Right out of the box, the Keurig K1500 impressed me with its sleek and modern design. With its compact size measuring 12.4 inches tall and roughly 10.3 inches in width, it easily fit just under my low kitchen cabinets without stealing too much counter space. The black color and minimalist aesthetic felt quite sophisticated. It’s sturdy, too—heavy enough not to wobble around (it weighs 12.2 pounds) but light enough to move if necessary. The extra-large 96 oz. water reservoir is clearly made for convenience, meaning fewer refills, an absolute blessing for those busy mornings. I also noticed how the materials felt solid and durable—not a cheap-feeling plastic in sight.

**Intuitive Features and User Interface**  
One thing I loved right away was that this coffee maker relies on buttons rather than complex touchscreens. This machine features straightforward controls that make brewing simple and fast. The four brewing size options (6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces) were convenient. I often alternated between a quick 8 oz. pick-me-up before work and a comforting 12 oz. brew on weekends when I wasn’t rushing out the door. The STRONG brew button didn’t disappoint—it genuinely amps up the boldness of the coffee, something my partner, a fan of stronger flavors, particularly appreciated. Plus, it brews pods from over 30 brands offering 150+ varieties, keeping everyone in the household happy, whether they’re after coffee, tea, or even hot cocoa.

**[View Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker sale info on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b08491k416/)**

**Performance and Daily Use**  
Using this machine daily, I noticed just how quick and efficient it is. From the moment you press the button, a fresh cup is ready in under a minute. The Quiet Brew Technology was also a noticeable bonus. In the mornings, while my family is still asleep, the brewing process is barely noticeable. More importantly, the 96 oz. water reservoir means I only needed to refill it once every few days with moderate use—I can’t overstate how much that reduces hassle. Interestingly, it also includes an auto-off feature that comes in handy for energy-conscious users like myself who detest wasting electricity. This little addition lends some peace of mind and feels futuristic in the best possible way.

**Advantages**  
When it comes to the strengths, the Keurig K1500 has more than a few, such as:  
- The STRONG brew button delivers a noticeable improvement for those who crave bolder coffee flavors.  
- A massive 96 oz. water reservoir cuts down the need to refill constantly.  
- Quiet Brew Technology ensures minimal noise disruption during brewing cycles.  

**Negatives**  
However, I did notice some areas for improvement:  
- As a pod-based machine, it isn’t the most eco-friendly option unless you seek out reusable components.  
- The size, while compact for its capacity, might still feel a touch bulky in some smaller home kitchens.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Keurig K1500 to other popular machines on the market, I find it holds up well in most respects. For instance, models like the Nespresso Vertuo offer a slightly more premium-feeling experience with their unique crema layer, but they fall short in accommodating large-capacity water tanks or supporting non-proprietary pods. Regular household drip espresso makers may cater to families looking for traditional brewing methods, though they lack the speed and convenience that the K1500 chiefly offers. Other Keurig models, such as the K-Elite, might appeal to those looking for a more compact machine but sacrifice the business-use scalability that the K1500 manages.

**Worth Every Penny**  
From a price-to-quality ratio standpoint, this coffee maker feels like an intelligent purchase for anyone looking for variety, speed, and reliability in cup after cup. While the initial investment might feel higher compared to a basic drip coffee machine, the convenience and versatility certainly justify it. Having the ability to quickly brew anything from strong coffee to tea without complicated processes makes it a valuable addition to a busy lifestyle or office environment. Not currently on my list of regrets, that’s for sure.

1mjbgd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mjbgd3/does_the_espro_p7_french_press_deliver_the/,Does the ESPRO P7 French Press Deliver the Ultimate Coffee Experience?,"The ESPRO 1032C2 has graced my kitchen for a couple of months now, and I must say, it has become an essential part of my daily routine. As someone who can’t function without a strong, smooth cup of coffee first thing in the morning, getting to know this stainless steel French press has been quite the journey. With its polished design and thoughtful features, I’ve found myself smiling a little more as my coffee brews. Don’t be fooled though; this little marvel isn’t without its quirks. Here’s my honest take based on daily use, upsides, and a few snags worth noting.

**Eye-Catching Design**

Right out of the box, the polished stainless steel finish grabs your attention. It fits beautifully into a minimalist or industrial kitchen vibe, yet feels timeless enough to stay fashionable. The double-walled construction not only adds heft but serves a practical purpose too—it keeps your coffee hot longer. Though its weight gave me a worry at first (it's about 2.7 pounds), I soon realized this contributes to its sturdy, durable feel. The attention to detail in the cylindrical shape and ergonomic design impressed me. During rushed mornings, its balance in-hand makes pouring not just easy but oddly satisfying. However, it does take up a bit of counter space, so those with tiny kitchens may need to get creative about where to house it.

**Brewing Performance**

Coffee lovers, listen closely: the filter system on this thing is game-changing. The double micro-mesh filters deliver a cup of coffee that feels pure and free of sediment. Gone are the days of slurry lurking in the bottom of my mug, which was my main frustration with cheaper French presses. I noticed right away that not only was this coffee smoother, but its flavor profiles really stood out. Even more delicate, fruity notes weren’t dulled. On lazy Saturdays, the ESPRO French press also proved its worth for infusing tea, which might even turn coffee purists into occasional tea drinkers. The only catch? Cleaning those filters can take a bit of finessing since coffee grounds have a habit of wedging themselves right into the fine mesh.

**Strong Points**

- Double micro-mesh filters for smooth, grit-free coffee
- Durable, polished double-walled stainless steel retains heat effectively  
- Works equally well for tea and infusions  
- Comfortable to handle and pour, even with its substantial weight  

[Check ESPRO 1032C2 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b011wtmh4o/)

**Flaws to Consider**

Of course, even the best products come with their challenges, and this French press is no exception. After heavy use, a few areas become apparent where it could improve.  
- Cleaning the double filter can feel time-consuming compared to simpler systems  
- Slightly bulky design—requires decent counter space  
- Price is understandably higher due to the premium build, which may put off budget-conscious coffee lovers  

**Usability and Target Audience**

After a few weeks of daily use, I believe this French press is ideal for discerning coffee drinkers who value quality and don’t mind spending extra for consistency. It’s also a thoughtful gift for anyone who’s serious about their java or loves experimenting with home-brewing methods. That said, if you’re someone who needs a quick, no-mess solution, or has never used a French press before, this might feel overwhelming at first. For those new to manual brewing, there’s a bit of a learning curve in nailing the grind size and steeping time for the perfect brew.

**Competing Brands**

Over the years, I’ve flirted with other French presses from Bodum and a generic stainless steel brand that I can’t even remember. While Bodum’s glass models are aesthetically pleasing, they simply can’t compete when it comes to heat retention or durability. On the flipside, generic steel options often lack the filtration finesse. ESPRO’s double-mesh filter system really sets it apart, especially if gritty coffee has ever been your pet peeve. That extra layer of refinement might make a substantial difference in preference, though if you don't mind a bit of ""sludge,"" some cheaper options might suffice.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Whenever I recommend this French press to friends or co-workers, price is always their first question. Is it worth it? In my opinion, yes—if brewing exceptional coffee is non-negotiable for you. This isn’t one of those coffee gadgets that will sit in your cabinet collecting dust after the novelty wears off. Its durability and high-quality results justify the investment in the long run. Plus, its versatility is a bonus, giving you the option to switch between coffee, tea, and other infusions.

What should I do?,"Well, it is really deep if you look into my relationship with my Boyfriend. So me and my Boyfriend who I'll call Bruce have been dating for almost a year(9-10 Months). And most of the time it has been great but gradually over time his attitude towards me has started changing. As an example, I am a social butterfly and I get along with almost anyone. Bruce is too, this is the way we started dating. He knew that I has male friends and I thought he respected them. I have a male friend, let's call him Alex. Alex and I have a lot in common and we have been in the same friend group since the first year we started our school. Alex had some problems with my friends' boyfriends' jealousy. One day Bruce just came up to me and said ""Stop talking with Alex. Lose his social medias."" And of course I talked with him about Alex, about the lies and framing he got from said friends' boyfriends. He didn't budge. As I loved Bruce, I slowly stopped contacting Alex altogether. I didn't lose his Social media but just stopped calling or texting him which we did before. After that, I had a similar thing with an another Male Friend of mine. Same story. I did as what he told me. I loved him. Some time later we started having intimate moments and I thought ""some"" were great. He started wanting more and gradually it was the only thing he talked about. We had a huge fight, and he got back to normal. We had our valentines day, our birthdays, I even graduated his Mother's and Father's day, gave him gifts. My family is well with money I never had a problem with it. Him on the other side is not well off, so I had to give him money a few times. I would do it again if he asked me, it's really not a problem for me but He always makes this comments how he talks about my father like he is a millionaire. ""Of course you can spend a thousand on Makeup, your Father is rich."" ""Of course it's no big deal for you, you guys are rich."" And like, thousand is not a big amount of money because we live in Turkiye. Beside from money-speaking, he always makes me drown. And I mean affectionally Drown. He always asks where am I, what am I doing, Who I am with, When I'll be free to talk, when we can have some ""intimate"" time and so on. He keeps calendars and receipts for when is my period, when did I visit where... in our 3-4 month mark I think, we had a break from school. He texted me CONSTANTLY. I don't mean in a sweat, affectionate way. He texted me every two hours and if I didn't respond, I got to listen to him being upset and offended. I mean, I don't use texting apps often and I really like going out. He knew it. Yet, he got his way of making me sit home and always text him. Again, we had huge fights with his problems and my anger issues in the way. I hate being drowned and being constantly asked for, I get easily angry by that. I am trying to get over it but he keeps testing my limits. From when we started dating, I never had time for myself. I never got to go out with my friends for lunch. and If I did, he came too. He befriended my friends, which is a good thing on the surface. He slowly learned everything about me. Even the things I didn't like or didn't share. Being drowned from constant attention, I tried to break up with him one time in our 8-month mark. It didn't go well, let me tell you. He had a massive fight with his family about money and he didn't plan his ahead. He texted me saying ""Thank You"" and you get the idea. I made him stop by saying him we'll start over, fix our relationship. I never wanted that. I was scared for his life. About 2-3 days ago we met at a coffee shop near my house. We sat and started talking. He never respected my boundaries, kissed my head almost every time I bent down to show him something, and even If I tried to go back, he would grab me and force a kiss on my head. He was sitting across from me, as I wanted him but he forced himself near me. then he started with his usual crocodile tears how he missed me and he wanted to kiss me, hug me, feel me. (Yes he said ""feel"" don't cringe.) So we switched seats and he tried to force kissing me, he only got cheek. He again wanted to hug me so with his acting, we got in a park. I never wanted it because My family doesn't know about him and for the best, I wouldn't want them to know him. I said ""My father could be around and he does see me"" but he didn't listen and comply. I saw a friend. Again, male friend. let's call him Josh. Bruce doesn't like Josh (How different of him) because he is like a new friend of mine. (Again, he was around more than Bruce.) I tried to talk to Josh but my mother called, so it was not possible. After the phone call, I wanted to meet Bruce to Josh face-to-face, Bruce wouldn't budge. He didn't want and said ""He sorta knew that I was your boyfriend, that's enough."" So we went to the said park. He tried kissing me and I didn't want it, told him to stop and quit forcing me. He was quiet for a second and didn't look me in the eyes. then asked ""What is my mistake?"" I didn't even think and said ""You're too much."" He started crying and I comforted him. He said ""You don't love me, I know but why you keep withdrawing from me?"" I didn't think SADLY and said ""I love you but I need time, I don't like how you drown me."" and so we sat there for half and hour. I had to run errands so I went to a supermarket. He came with me but the supermarket was WAY OFF his road to home and in the COMPLETELY OPPOSITE side. I said ""Don't come with me"" I nearly begged but he wouldn't budge. I made a speedrun and we got out of the market. I went straight to home. I was feeling nauseous by then and I was going to throw up if I stayed any longer with him. He asked again if we could meet up but I said a lie that I couldn't come. I really need and want to break up but I don't know. What should I do?",1,1754502191.0,WhatShouldIDo,15,1.0,False

1mjbb0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mjbb0m/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Review Worth Reading,"Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 is a coffee maker that's been on my radar for a while. I brew coffee every morning, and I’m one of those people who can't function without their cup of caffeine. Naturally, I was excited to test this highly-rated coffee machine. The moment I unboxed it, I could tell it was no average appliance. With its sleek off-white design and sturdy build, it feels more like an artisanal piece made specifically for coffee fanatics like me.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker brings a kind of minimalist elegance to my kitchen counter. Designed with dimensions of 6.5""D x 12.75""W x 14""H, it fits neatly without hogging too much space, which is perfect for smaller kitchens. The off-white exterior is clean and modern, while the glass carafe gives it a premium vibe. It doesn't feel heavy despite weighing 6.25 pounds, yet it’s robust enough to reassure me of its durability. One thing I appreciate the most is knowing that it’s handmade in the Netherlands—it gives off an extra touch of uniqueness.

**Ease of Use**

I’m not someone who loves fiddling with complicated gadgets first thing in the morning, and this machine was a dream to use. With just a single switch operation and the Brew-Volume Selector, choosing between brewing half or a full carafe is a breeze. It’s hard to mess up. Brewing a full 40-ounce pot only takes 4 to 6 minutes, which is fantastic when I’m rushing out the door. Trust me, as someone who's tried plenty of coffee machines in the past, finding one that balances speed and quality this well is unusual.

**Quiet and Safe Operations**

Living in a household where people wake up at different times, the quiet operation has been a lifesaver. The brewing process doesn’t disrupt my partner’s sleep, which has spared me complaints. Also, the auto shut-off feature kicks in after 100 minutes, so I’m not constantly worrying about whether I turned it off before leaving the house. The safety and peace of mind this feature brings are far superior to my previous coffee maker.

**Advantages**

- Heats water to the perfect temperature for coffee extraction.
- Brews an entire carafe in just 4-6 minutes.
- Quiet operation and auto shut-off after 100 minutes.
- Comes with a five-year warranty for extra reliability.

**Delicious Coffee Quality**

The flavor and richness this machine extracts from my beans are unmatched. It’s like having your favorite café’s coffee at home. The coffee is consistently smooth and flavorful, likely thanks to its precise brewing temperature and the paper filter system. I didn’t even have to experiment much with bean types to notice how good it was. Every cup feels like it was engineered to perfection.

**Drawbacks**

- Pricey compared to basic coffee makers.  
- Doesn’t include reusable filters; you’re stuck with using paper filters.  

**Competing Products**

Being a coffee enthusiast, I’ve tried alternatives like the Breville Bambino and the Keurig K-Café. While the Breville offers excellent espresso shots, it doesn’t stand up to this machine for drip coffee quality. As for the Keurig system, I’d say its convenience in terms of pods is appealing, but the flavor doesn’t hold a candle to this coffee maker. The Technivorm model feels like a step above with its elegant performance and focus solely on brewing proper coffee, not shortcuts.

**Quality for Price**

This coffee maker does come with a higher price tag, but given its features, I’d say it’s a worthwhile investment. You’re not only paying for a machine but also the craftsmanship and thought put into its design. The five-year warranty is a solid bonus, too—it’s a reassurance that you won’t be replacing it anytime soon. While less-expensive options exist, they usually compromise durability or coffee quality, whereas this machine genuinely justifies its cost.

The first time it happened, I woke up in the park two blocks away from my apartment. My shoes were wet with morning dew, and my phone was dead. I had no memory of leaving my bed. I laughed it off, assuming I’d had a rough night, maybe took a walk to clear my head.

But it kept happening.

Day after day, I’d wake up in random places—on a bus bench, inside a 24-hour laundromat, once even in the alley behind my workplace. I started locking my bedroom door, but somehow I still ended up outside. I set up a camera in my room. All it captured was me lying there still, peacefully asleep, the entire night.

Then, things got weirder.

My coworkers noticed changes in me. I’d forget things—small things at first, like what project I was working on. Then entire conversations. I started getting headaches. Bad ones. Pulsing, hot migraines that made my vision blur.

I went to doctors. Neurologists. Therapists. No one had answers.

One night, I duct-taped myself to the bed. I wrapped my arms, my legs—everything. I even tied my waist to the frame. I woke up the next morning in a cemetery three miles from home.

The tape was still on me.

That’s when I stopped laughing.

⸻

It wasn’t just sleepwalking. I started losing time.

I’d wake up mid-day in places I didn’t remember walking into—fast food joints, subway cars, libraries. I found receipts in my pockets for things I didn’t buy. Once, I opened my phone and found pictures of a house I’d never seen before.

That’s when I noticed him.

In one of the pictures—just at the edge of the frame—there was a man. Bald, pale, tall. He was wearing the same gray hoodie in every shot. I thought I was imagining it at first. But then he started appearing elsewhere—in reflections, in the corners of my eyes, on security cameras.

I wasn’t alone.

⸻

I decided to follow myself.

I rigged up a simple GPS tracker to my phone and used another phone to watch my location. I set the camera again. That night, I went to sleep—fully expecting nothing.

At 3:42 a.m., my phone moved.

I checked the camera footage. My body was still in bed.

But the GPS dot was moving.

I jumped out of bed and followed it, running barefoot down the street. The dot stopped at an abandoned office building two miles away. I pushed the door open and climbed the stairs. The third floor was empty, dusty… until I saw a figure in the corner, standing still.

It was me.

Or something that looked like me.

He turned around and smiled.

⸻

I ran.

I don’t remember how I got home. I locked every door, every window, unplugged everything, smashed the camera. I stayed awake for three days straight, living off energy drinks and fear. But eventually, exhaustion won.

And when I woke up… I was in a padded room.

The walls were white, cushioned. No windows. One door.

I screamed until someone came.

A man in a gray hoodie.

The same one.

He knelt beside me and whispered, “You’re not the only one. But you’re the first to find me.”

Then he smiled—and vanished.

⸻

I woke up again—in my own bed. Sunlight poured through the blinds.

Was it a dream?

I wanted to believe it was.

Until I noticed the bruises on my wrists—the same ones I had in the padded room. My phone was gone. My GPS app was deleted.

But one new app had appeared on my screen: “Observer.”

No icon. Just the word.

I tapped it.

A black screen.

Then words appeared: “Thank you for your participation.”

My vision blurred. My ears rang.

Then I heard a voice. Mine. Saying:

“Iteration 6,104 complete. Subject is stabilizing.”

⸻

That’s when I understood: I wasn’t the observer.

I was the experiment.

⸻

I’ve spent the last two months trying to break the cycle. Every day, I wake up somewhere else. Sometimes, I remember who I am. Other days, I feel like a passenger in someone else’s life.

But I’ve started fighting back.

Each time I wake, I leave myself a message—a note, a word, a symbol. I tattooed a small “X” on my wrist. I whisper reminders into my phone.

Last week, I found the building again. The abandoned office.

This time, I brought fire.

I set it ablaze. Watched it burn. Screamed into the smoke. I don’t know if it changed anything. But since then, I haven’t seen the man in gray.

⸻

This morning, I woke up in my own bed again.

It’s the third day in a row.

I think I’m winning.

But the Observer app is still there.

And every time I open it, there’s a new message.

Today’s said:

“You’re doing well, Liam. Only a few more iterations to go.”

⸻

The fourth morning I woke up in my bed, I didn’t trust it.

I stayed frozen under the covers, eyes darting around the room. Everything looked familiar—too familiar. My desk lamp had a scratch I remembered. The cup on my shelf still had a coffee stain from last week. But something felt… off.

I crept out of bed and checked the windows. Same view. Then I checked my phone. The Observer app was still there, sitting quietly. I didn’t open it this time.

Instead, I opened my recorder app and spoke: “Day 4. Woke up at home. No sightings. Will attempt to track environment anomalies.”

I had started cataloging everything. Smells. Sounds. Light direction. Even how the floor creaked under my feet. I was done trusting my own memory.

Later that day, I went to a library I remembered visiting in one of the stranger “iterations.” I scanned the shelves until I found it—a book I remembered seeing in a dream. The cover was navy blue, titleless, with a single embossed triangle in the center.

I opened it, expecting gibberish or blank pages.

What I found chilled me.

Each page was a log.

My log.

Detailed descriptions of places I had woken up in, word for word. Emotions. Interactions. Conversations. Even the part where I burned the office.

Someone was writing down everything I did. Every choice.

There was a sticky note inside the last page. It read:

“You’re doing better than the others.”

That night, I didn’t sleep.

I started building a map. Pinning every place I’d woken up in. They were scattered at first. Random. But eventually, a shape began to form.

A spiral.

And at the center of that spiral, there was one place I hadn’t been to yet.

An old industrial facility on the outskirts of the city.

I knew I had to go.

⸻

I waited for nightfall. Packed a bag—food, water, flashlight, burner phone, and a hammer. I wore dark clothes, left the house without touching anything electronic.

The facility was fenced off, but the gate had already been broken, rusted and hanging off its hinges. Like someone had been coming and going for years.

Inside, the air was stale, full of dust and damp rot. Machines covered in tarps, old blinking lights that somehow still worked. I kept walking until I found a staircase going down.

Basement level.

Concrete walls. Buzzing fluorescent lights. The hallway curved gently, leading to a metal door labeled: “Iteration Control Room.”

My hand shook as I pushed it open.

Inside was a wall of screens. Surveillance footage. Some live, some replaying memories—my memories. The padded room. The GPS trail. Even the night I taped myself to the bed.

Sitting in the center of the room was a man in a lab coat.

He didn’t look surprised to see me.

“You made it further than expected,” he said, smiling faintly.

I raised the hammer.

He didn’t flinch. “You can kill me if you want. But it won’t stop the program. You’re part of it now.”

“What is this?” I demanded. “Why me?”

“Not just you. Thousands like you. But you… you’re stabilizing. That means your mind is adapting. You might actually retain your identity through the final phase.”

He tapped a keyboard. One screen zoomed in on my face—live footage.

I glanced behind me. There was no camera.

“You’ve become self-aware, Liam. That makes you dangerous… and fascinating.”

I smashed the keyboard. The screen flickered.

“Tell me how to end it,” I said.

The man shrugged. “End it? You can’t. But you can override it.”

He slid a USB drive across the table.

“This contains the override protocol. But once you use it, your body will be stuck in one iteration. Forever. No resets. No backdoors. One life. One shot.”

I took it.

Before I left, he said, “Good luck.”

⸻

Back home, I stared at the drive all night.

Was this real? Or another illusion? Another test?

I plugged it in.

A window popped up: “Upload Override. Confirm?”

I hesitated. Then clicked “Yes.”

The screen went black.

Then: “Iteration root locked. Consciousness anchored.”

⸻

It’s been 21 days.

I wake up in the same bed. Every time. No jumps. No spirals. No men in gray hoodies.

But I still hear them sometimes—in dreams, in the hum of machines.

The Observer app is gone.

But I kept the triangle book.

Just in case.

⸻

I thought it was over.

For three weeks, everything was quiet. Normal. I even started rebuilding parts of my life—going back to work, talking to my parents again, sleeping through the night without fear. My mind felt sharper. Stronger.

But I should’ve known better.

On day twenty-two, I found something odd. A sticky note on my bathroom mirror. In my own handwriting.

“Don’t trust tomorrow.”

I didn’t remember writing it.

That night, I placed a piece of paper on my nightstand, along with a pen. Before going to bed, I wrote:

“If you remember writing the mirror note, draw a star.”

I woke up.

There was no star. Instead, someone had written:

“He’s adapting too.”

My chest went cold.

I checked every door, every window. All locked. The triangle book was missing.

Then, just before sunset, I saw him again.

Across the street. Standing perfectly still.

The man in the gray hoodie.

He didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

Just raised his hand—and pointed at me.

⸻

I stayed inside for two days after that.

I thought the override had worked. I thought I’d won.

But what if this is just another layer? A deeper iteration?

I couldn’t be sure anymore.

So I made a decision.

If I can’t tell what’s real—then I’ll make something real.

I started writing. Every memory, every version of myself I could recall. I filled pages and notebooks. I recorded my voice, filmed myself speaking, repeating: “This is real. I am Liam. I survived.”

I started leaving these messages in different places—libraries, cafes, even hidden in books. Just in case someone else is stuck like I was.

Maybe they’ll find them.

Maybe they’ll wake up.

And maybe… one of them will finish what I started.

⸻

If you ever see a triangle carved into a wall…

Or find a book with no title…

Or wake up somewhere you don’t recognize…

You’re not broken.

You’re not alone.

And most importantly—

1mjb9se,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mjb9se/could_the_oxo_rapid_brewer_coffee_maker_review/,Could the OXO Rapid Brewer coffee maker review transform your morning brew forever?,"I’ve had the OXO 8722500 Rapid Brewer Coffee Maker in my daily arsenal for a few weeks now, and it’s definitely earned a spot on my countertop. I mean, as someone who starts every morning with a caffeine ritual, this coffee maker not only makes brewing easy but also oddly satisfying. The idea of getting hot or cold coffee concentrate in about five minutes felt too good to be true at first—spoiler alert, it totally works. Of course, there are standout features and a few quirks, which I’ll walk you through so you can decide if this gadget is worth adding to your daily grind.

**Design and Portability**  
The Rapid Brewer is designed with portability in mind, and it shows. Its compact size—roughly the size of a thermos—fits perfectly into my backpack without feeling bulky. It’s ideal if you’re someone always on the move, like I am during road trips or office commutes. The black finish gives it a sleek, modern look, while the sturdy construction feels premium for its lightweight frame (just over a pound). Another thing I noticed is the locking pump mechanism; it's a fantastic safety feature, whether it's in storage or tumbling around in a bag. It's not flashy, but it’s practical, which I appreciate.

**Ease of Use**  
Manual operation often gets a bad rap, but the Rapid Brewer simplifies the entire brewing process. Just fill the stainless steel filter with finely ground coffee, add water, lock the pump, and let it do its thing. Brewing hot coffee takes two minutes, while cold brew takes around five. It’s also surprisingly mess-free—no annoying paper filters to deal with because of the reusable stainless steel filter. Cleaning is a breeze, too, since all parts except the pump are dishwasher safe. Washing by hand feels more like a quick rinse than a chore, which is nice when you're rushing in the morning.

[Find the best price for OXO 8722500 Rapid Brewer Coffee Maker on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
The coffee quality? Surprisingly impressive for such a simple gadget. The rainmaker showerhead evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, ensuring consistent flavor extraction, a feature you typically expect from high-end brewers. Adjusting flavors is straightforward—you can tweak the grind size, coffee-to-water ratio, and water temperature to customize the strength. Whether brewing a hot Americano or crafting some cold brew for a sunny afternoon, the Rapid Brewer delivers. I tried using it to make a Vietnamese-style iced coffee with condensed milk, and it nailed the sweetness-to-boldness ratio on the first try. The concentrated coffee is smooth, low in acidity, and free of over-extraction bitterness.

**Good Points**  
- Compact and travel-friendly design.  
- Reusable stainless steel filter eliminates the need for paper filters.  
- Makes both hot and cold coffee concentrate quickly.  
- Easy to clean, with dishwasher-safe parts.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Manual operation might not appeal to everyone.  
- Limited capacity—only brews one serving at a time.  
- The locking pump can sometimes feel a bit stiff.  

**Target User and Practicality**  
This coffee maker is perfect if you value convenience and versatility. It’s a dream come true for travelers, minimalists, or anyone tired of shelling out five bucks for a daily coffee fix. Families or those brewing for multiple people might find it less helpful since it brews just one portion at a time. As a solo coffee drinker, though, it’s been great for me. Plus, the ability to make customized coffee concentrate opens up so many drink options if you’re the creative type.

**Product Competitors**  
In the crowded coffee maker landscape, options like the AeroPress or French press often come up as direct rivals. Compared to an AeroPress, the Rapid Brewer is less finicky—no worrying about air pressure or precise timing. However, the AeroPress does offer more capacity, so it’s better for brewing double servings. On the other hand, a classic French press wins with simplicity and bigger brew sizes but lacks the versatility of making concentrate that the Rapid Brewer offers. The OXO product also edges ahead with its compact and travel-ready design, which neither alternative quite matches.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Is the Rapid Brewer worth it? Despite some minor drawbacks, it delivers strong value for its feature set. It provides brewing versatility—hot or cold—without the need for electricity, which adds to its cost-effectiveness. When you consider that you could easily save hundreds of dollars annually by ditching coffee shop visits, the investment feels downright economical. Plus, no recurring expenses like filters or pods make it even more budget-friendly in the long term. If you're the type who prefers quality coffee without breaking the bank, this gadget is a solid choice.

Stress or anxiety can make it flare up, and exercise or crying sometimes gives brief relief.

Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

Symptoms:
	•	Chronic fatigue / low motivation
	•	Brain fog, trouble focusing
	•	Daily headaches between the eyes, sometimes warm spine sensation
	•	Stress worsens symptoms; exercise/crying gives brief relief
	•	Tingling in arms/face/testicles during flare-ups
	•	Better in the afternoon/evening, worse late morning to early afternoon
	•	Multiple daily bowel movements after coffee/electrolytes
	•	Occasional early morning waking at 3–4 AM

Key Labs:
	•	Testosterone: consistently under 300 ng/dL (low for age)
	•	ACTH: 8 pg/mL (borderline low)
	•	Cortisol: 16 µg/dL recently (was 8.1 µg/dL in 2021)
	•	Prolactin: 6 ng/mL (normal)
	•	TSH and free T4: normal
	•	eGFR: gradually declining but still normal range
	•	PSA: 0.5 ng/mL (normal)
	•	Lipids slightly elevated (~214 total cholesterol)

Notes:
	•	MRI previously showed a normal-looking pituitary
	•	I’ve been on SSRIs (Lexapro) long-term; I sometimes feel slightly better if I miss a dose
	•	Electrolytes (Gatorade, Liquid IV) seem to provide temporary symptom relief
	•	Symptoms feel worse with stress, better with exercise and emotional release

My questions:
	1.	Could this be secondary hypogonadism / HPA axis dysfunction despite “normal” cortisol?
	2.	Could low-normal ACTH explain my chronic headaches and fatigue?
	3.	Would a trial of hydrocortisone or enclomiphene/hCG be reasonable next steps?
	4.	Has anyone experienced similar “flare-ups” of headaches and fatigue that improve with exercise or emotional release?
	5.	Any suggestions for tests I should request or patterns I should track to better demonstrate dysfunction?

It’s called **Coffee Bags**, and it helps users catalog, rate, and organize their coffee beans. It's a coffee nerd thing, IYKYK.

App Store Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coffee-bags-beans-collection/id6744313367](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coffee-bags-beans-collection/id6744313367)

**Built for myself first**

This started as a personal itch — I buy lots of different coffees, and I wanted a way to track which beans I liked, which roasters I preferred, and what to avoid. I always intended to, eventually, release it to the public, but for years I have been fine using the debug version on my personal device. 😅

**A few things I thought might be interesting to others here:**

Built in SwiftUI and SwiftData. The app went through multiple rewrites — originally started with Core Data, which I did not enjoy at all (the visual editor was anything but helpful, the way Swift optionals are handled is very confusing). When SwiftData was announced, I immediately switched to it. It has been fine for the most part, but I still find it to be littered with limitations and strange quirks.

I am no designer, so coming up with an ok app icon was probably the most difficult thing I had to do. I ended up using the free SVG drawing app InkScape to trace my own terrible drawing.

To setup the In-app-purchases I basically followed Paul Hudson's great video series on the subject verbatim ... thinking about it, most everything else I learned from him. I find Apple's own documentation to be ~~complete garbage~~ lacking.

App Store review was surprisingly smooth — I was bracing for rejections, but it got approved on the first submission (with in-app purchases and all).

**Monetization and future**

The app is free for the first few coffees, then it's a one time in-app-purchase to unlock it fully. No subscriptions.

I don’t expect to make much from it, but I wanted the learning experience. I'm still trying to figure out the business/marketing side of things.

P.S. I was concerned with releasing an app so close to the new iOS, but looking at how this Liquid Glass redesign is going, I have a feeling a lot of people won't be upgrading to iOS 26 anytime soon... and I didn't want to be waiting any longer.",1,1754501834.0,iosapps,0,1.0,False
1mjb6mm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjb6mm,Flair Go - Why the Bad Reviews?,"Some precontext: I’m fairly new to espresso, about a year in, and have fallen in love with the little cup of syrupy goodness multiple times a day. My main driver is a La Pavoni Euripicola, which I absolutely love. Coming from an engineering background, I love the manual espresso machinery aspect. 

Now: I’ve been doing a fair bit of traveling and tired of paying $4+ USD for an espresso from coffee shops. While it’s fun to try new beans and new shops, sometimes I just wanna make my own. 

Thus, I’ve been doing some research and found Flair machines as a good option. Even the Neo Flex and classic were potentials for me. I found the Go and did some research on it… only to find bad reviews following the kickstarter campaign. 

I was turned off for a couple of months, but finally pulled the trigger on the Go after not being able to wait long anymore. 

To my surprise, most of the issues that came up with the kickstarter campaign, I don’t have…? I’m quite surprised, delighted, but surprised

1. There’s no wobbling issues. Really.. if you can pull the machine lever straight down while on a flat surface, it doesn’t wobble one bit. 

2. The contact points.  While I’ve only had the machine a couple weeks, the rubber feet seem very secure and hold the machine in place on a counter. 

3. “It’s not as good as a Neo Flex”. I’ve seen a couple people on this sub say this. And while I’ve never used a Flex, I’ve seen quite a flew videos in my research, and the larger footprint and plastic build just don’t seem worth the $80 discount from the Flair Go. 

While the Go has been fantastic, I have had a couple issues outside of things people have brought up before:

1. The puck screen they include gets coffee grounds stuck in it… constantly. It’s incredibly difficult to clean thoroughly. Pretty frustrating. 

2. The portafilter flow cap (which switches the machine to a bottomless portafilter, is impossible to remove without a knife. I had to email support to ask how to remove it safely. 

All in all, the 4lbs packed Flair Go has been a dream for everyday use while traveling. The pick prep is fairly simple, cleaning isn’t as easy as my La Pavoni or a handled portafilter (but that’s not why we bought the machine anyways), and the lightweight, but solid aluminum frame is sturdy, comfortable, and pulls some amazing shots. 

TL;DR: The Go doesn’t really deserve the hate it gets.

1mjb19e,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivateAuto/comments/1mjb19e/tricks_to_keep_your_car_interior_spotless/,Tricks to Keep Your Car Interior Spotless,"Keeping your car interior spotless doesn't have to be complicated, but it makes a huge difference in both daily comfort and eventual resale value. A clean, organized interior creates a more enjoyable driving experience and shows potential buyers that you've taken care of your vehicle.

**Getting Started with the Right Supplies**

You don't need expensive products—just the right basics. A handheld vacuum with brush attachments, microfiber cloths, interior cleaner spray, and an upholstery brush will handle most jobs. For leather seats, add a leather-specific cleaner and conditioner. For fabric seats, stick with mild soap solutions that won't oversoak the material. Keep an old toothbrush handy for detailed work in cup holders and vents where debris likes to collect.

**Declutter First, Clean Second**

Before any actual cleaning, remove everything that doesn't belong: receipts, bottles, wrappers, and random items that accumulate over time. Check under seats and in storage compartments. Once the clutter is gone, organize what stays—use small bins for kids' items, keep emergency supplies contained in the trunk, and store cables in console organizers. Having designated spots for everything prevents future mess buildup.

**Surface-Specific Cleaning Techniques**

Different materials need different approaches. For fabric seats, vacuum thoroughly using crevice tools, then lightly scrub with mild soap solution and a soft brush. Leather seats should be cleaned with leather-specific products, followed by conditioner to prevent cracking. Dashboard and door panels respond well to interior spray cleaner with microfiber cloths—aim for a non-greasy finish. Floor mats can be shaken out, vacuumed, and for rubber mats, hosed down and scrubbed. Always let everything dry completely before reassembling.

**Keeping It Fresh**

A clean car should smell good too. Regular cleaning prevents most odor buildup, but natural solutions like baking soda sprinkled on surfaces (then vacuumed up) can absorb lingering smells. Essential oils on cotton balls provide subtle freshening, while coffee beans or charcoal bags help neutralize stronger odors. Choose air fresheners that aren't overpowering and remember to ventilate regularly.

A well-maintained interior not only makes every drive more pleasant but also significantly impacts your car's appeal if you decide to sell. Clean interiors in photos attract more serious buyers and suggest the vehicle has been properly cared for.

Is this really the end?,"I met a guy through mutual friends. From the beginning, we had a strong connection - texting daily, long conversations, occasional meetups. There was warmth, flirting, shared interests, and emotional closeness. He told me he found me physically attractive, that he loved spending time with me… but also mentioned that he didn’t feel “the spark” he believes is necessary for a romantic relationship.

We were seeing each other for almost three months. I developed real feelings for him - not by pressuring, just by being present, kind, and open. Sometimes he came closer, sometimes pulled away. He eventually said he saw me “more as a friend,” yet kept acting in ways that didn’t match that - with compliments, flirtation, and affectionate gestures.

At our last meetup, we spent over 24 hours together: museum, lunch, drinks, deep conversations – including him opening up about his family history. We ended up sleeping together - something that had been building between us. It was warm, connected, open. Afterward, I expected him to leave… but he didn’t want to. He kept cuddling, kissing, we made breakfast together, drank coffee, played music. He even said “I already miss you” before walking out the door.

That morning, I told him I couldn’t continue this as just friends. That it would only hurt me. I said if he ever felt differently - romantically - he could reach out, but otherwise I needed to walk away. He seemed truly sad. His eyes got glassy. He said it felt like I was going away to the other side of the world.

Now a few days have passed. He hasn’t reached out. He accidentally left his glasses at my place. I know he’s reading a book I also wanted to read, and he once said he listened to our shared playlist when we weren’t talking, so I know some things may remind him of me.

I’m feeling calmer now than I was during the confusing stage - when I didn’t know where I stood. But I still feel sadness, longing, and a bit of grief. I’m also wondering if I did the right thing by walking away - maybe I didn’t give it enough time to grow? Maybe he needed space to realize something?

And yet… I didn’t want to keep hoping and analyzing every small gesture while he stayed on the fence. Have any of you been through something like this?

Context: I was working at an event for 2 days with a girl. We were basically together for 16 hours a day and got along pretty quickly. We laughed a lot during these days, suffered through our shift and all, we even watched a movie while we were working. When I saw how stressfull she was Igave her a neck massage which she was very thankfull for, I side huged her when she completely lost her patience against a co-worker. At the end of our shifts I ensured her to not carry the heavy bags, always opened the door and offered to carry her bags.

There were times when she was keep getting hitted on and she always looked for my attention and I tried to make her feel comfortable. She felt comfortable enough to dump her problems with our boss on me, and even talk about getting cheated on by his ex. I dont mean she feels the same way as me just because of the things I mentioned but she is a lovely, kind, caring person so maybe she was just happy to work with someone who isnt like those douchebags she usually works with.

So once the 2 day was coming to an end I told her (at the tram station where she dropped me of so I wouldnt walk for half an hour) how pretty, and what a cute caring person she is and I would love to get a tea or coffee with her (I started saying tea first because I knew she likes it). To response she didnt say no she just told me that “We will discuss it”. At that moment I thought she is saying no just in her extremely polite way so I didnt asked for her insta I just said “All right then have a safe drive home”.

We both know each others name and it really isnt hard to find either her or mine insta. Do I follow her private acc and see if she accepts it or do I leave it the way it is because she just felt like I am a friend at work and it was a clear rejection or she was just tired after a long week of work and couldnt be bothered?

P.S.: there is a very little % that I am going to be working at the same place as she works again, but she kinda takes the same route to her job as me but its very unlikely we will meet again by random

1mjawp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mjawp0/showcase_the_best_popcorn_popper_nostalgia/,Showcase the Best Popcorn Popper Nostalgia Vintage Review Worth It,"Testing out the Nostalgia Nostalgia popcorn maker has been an unexpectedly delightful experience for me and my whole family. This quirky little machine, inspired by vintage street-corner popcorn stands from the early 1900s, has become a staple in our weekend movie nights. When I first saw the red and white design, I have to admit, it made me feel like I was stepping into an old-timey theater. But more than just looks, this air-popping machine has some standout features worth discussing.

**Design and Vintage Appeal**

The first thing you’ll notice about this popcorn maker is its charming, nostalgic design. It’s compact enough to sit neatly on my kitchen counter without taking up too much space. Measuring nine inches in length, eight inches in width, and seventeen inches tall, it fits comfortably between my coffee maker and toaster. The retro red-and-white color scheme paired with the wheels really nails that old-world, Americana aesthetic, making it as much a piece of décor as a functional appliance. My kids have taken to calling it “the little popcorn cart,” and it always sparks a conversation when guests come over.

**Performance and Popping**

Its performance is where this machine really shines. Capable of making up to twelve cups of popcorn in a single batch, this thing holds its own during family gatherings or parties. I particularly like that it uses hot air instead of oil, offering a much healthier snacking option. Watching the kernels dance and pop through the clear cover never gets old. There’s a unique swirling airflow created by the chamber, and it significantly reduces the number of unpopped kernels, which had been one of my biggest frustrations with other popcorn makers in the past. 

[Find the best price for Nostalgia Nostalgia on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b0b14mk7m9/)

**Ease of Use and Convenience**

Using this popcorn maker is pretty straightforward. The machine comes with a measuring cup, so you can always add the perfect amount of kernels without guessing. I’ve found this feature particularly useful on busy evenings when there’s no time to fiddle with trial and error. Just scoop the kernels, pour them in, switch it on, and within minutes you have fresh, fluffy popcorn. The popcorn is light and airy, just the way I like it, although some people might miss that buttery richness you get with oil-popped versions.

**Good Points**

- The vintage, retro design adds a fantastic aesthetic appeal.
- Hot-air technology ensures a healthier snack without needing oil.
- Twelve-cup capacity is perfect for small gatherings or family nights.
- Included measuring cup makes preparation foolproof.

**Weaknesses**

- The lack of an oil option means you have to melt butter separately for those who prefer a buttery flavor.
- It can get a bit noisy during operation, which might bother those sensitive to loud appliances.

**Features and Special Functions**

This popcorn maker isn’t just about popping kernels; it’s also designed for maximum family fun and convenience. It works with all kinds of kernel types, including those from the Nostalgia brand's popcorn kits. I tried the Theater Hot Air and Kettle Kit once, and it added an authentic movie-theater vibe to our evening. That said, you’re not limited to their branded kits – generic kernels work just as well, which makes this machine versatile for users on different budgets. 

Another feature worth a nod is how easy it is to clean. No oil means there’s no greasy residue to scrub off. A quick wipe with a damp cloth does the trick, and the removable components make the process hassle-free.

**Alternative Offerings**

Compared to its competitors, this nostalgic popcorn maker holds its own remarkably well. Alternatives like the Dash Hot Air Popcorn Maker or the Presto Poplite Hot Air Popper perform similarly, but they lack the charm of the vintage design. The Dash model, for instance, is compact and slick but feels more generic in its look. Meanwhile, Presto's Poplite boasts faster popping speeds, though it doesn’t offer that same aesthetic flair that Nostalgia delivers. The major selling point of this machine is the blend of function and style. While the others win in practicality, they don’t quite bring the fun factor to the table like this one does.

**Value Proposition**

On the topic of price, this popcorn maker offers fantastic value for its unique blend of retro aesthetics, functionality, and ease of use. While there are cheaper popcorn poppers on the market, few manage to combine form and function this well. Its sturdy construction and consistent popping performance make it feel like a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to upgrade their snacking game or inject a bit of vintage charm into home entertaining. It feels like one of those products that pays for itself in movie-night savings after repeated use.

1mjaw5u,https://v.redd.it/p4kuo6loofhf1,The Journey of Bosnian Coffee: From Bean to Cup in the Heart of Sarajevo,"In the heart of Sarajevo, potter Ismet Huseinović reveals the entire path of Bosnian coffee from bean to cup. The coffee is first roasted over low heat, until it acquires that recognizable dark color and aroma that fills the entire space. It is then sorted by hand, then pounded in an old dibek, after which it is sieved where it is ready for use. Finally, it is carefully baked in a copper tub, slowly, without haste, in order to achieve a kejef, a state in which Bosnians know how to truly enjoy. And all that, along with tools and dishes that are more than a hundred years old.



He is the eighth generation and has been doing this business for more than 48 years. He also has heirs, the sons Senad and Nermin. He inherited the craft from his father Mehmed, and he makes and sells traditional Bosnian souvenirs from copper, such as dzeves, casseroles, sahani, hand mills...



Huseinović built a museum under today's shop in Kazandžija, which anyone can visit and see handicrafts made two or three hundred years ago. It also has a guest book, in which all visitors write their impressions.



""We also have a bellows for blowing fire, which was made more than 300 years ago. No one does that anymore. Also, there are copper pans, sahani, jugumi, tubs, pots, cauldrons. It's all made of copper and no one makes it anymore,"" says Huseinović.

U srcu Sarajeva, kazandžija Ismet Huseinović otkriva nam cijeli put bosanske kahve od zrna do šoljice. Kahva se prvo prži na tihoj vatri, dok ne dobije onu prepoznatljivu tamnu boju i miris koji ispuni čitav prostor. Zatim se ručno prebire, pa tuca u starom dibeku, nakon čega se prosijava gdje je spremna za upotrebu. Na kraju, pažljivo se peče u bakrenom ibriku, lagano, bez žurbe, kako bi se postigao ćejf, stanje u kojem Bosanci znaju istinski uživati. I sve to, uz alat i posuđe staro više od sto godina. 


On je osma generacija i ovim poslom se bavi više od 48 godina. Ima i nasljednike, sinove Senada i Nermina. Zanat je naslijedio od oca Mehmeda, a od bakra izrađuje i prodaje tradicionalne bosanske suvenire, kao što su džezve, tepsije, sahani, ručni mlinovi...



Huseinović je ispod današnje kazandžijske radnje napravio muzej koji svako može posjetiti i vidjeti rukotvorine rađene prije dvije ili tri stotine godina. Ima i knjigu gostiju, u koju svi posjetioci pišu svoje utiske.



,,Imamo i mjeh za raspuhivanje vatre, koji je napravljen prije više od 300 godina. To više niko ne pravi. Također, tu su i bakrene tepsije, sahani, đugumi, ibrici, tendžere, kazani. Sve je to izrađeno od bakra i više to niko ne pravi” kaže Huseinović.

It's my first machine, which is why I'm cautious about buying it. But I want to buy a used one, as new machines are too expensive for me (around €1070 in Germany)

The description is as follows:

I have bought a new machine, I am offering my Lelit Elizabeth PL92T here.
I bought the machine in January 2023 from a German dealer and used it almost every day until recently. The shot counter counts a total of 2212 extractions.

The machine was used exclusively with bottled water (Purania / Volvic) or purified water and was descaled for the first time before the last cleaning.
The brew group was regularly backwashed with coffee fat remover.

The condition is good, but there are of course some signs of wear and tear, which can hardly be avoided with the stainless steel housing.

I replaced the handle of the original portafilter holder with a wooden handle made of olive wood from Brewspire.
An IMS CI 35 WM is fitted as a shower filter, and I have included an additional IMS CI 200 IM.
I recently replaced the brew group seal with a new silicone seal.
I enlarged the opening of the water tank with a Dremel for better filling (see photo).

I love my store and my baristas, I think we’ve genuinely cultivated a unique experience for both the folks who work here / get borrowed over and the regulars we love, but it’s honestly so little to do with decisions made by corporate, historically but especially these days. If anything, we have the highest metrics in our district and poor decision making by corporate is the ONLY thing that negatively effects that. 
I’m used to them not listening to partners at this point, I gave up on surveys a long time ago, but what gives? 
Is having us in strict uniform working twice as hard on 8-step frappuccino’s we were poorly trained to make during the “off season,” really about Starbucks’ identity? Is taking out my eyebrow piercing really going to sell more coffee?

1mjatdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mjatdk/explore_why_hamilton_beach_45_cup_coffee_urn/,Explore why Hamilton Beach 45 Cup Coffee Urn review stands out for large gatherings!,"The Hamilton Beach 40515R, also known as the Hamilton Beach 45 Cup Coffee Urn and Hot Beverage Dispenser, has been my go-to gadget for a while now for gatherings and office events. Having tested this product repeatedly in numerous scenarios, I’ve had the chance to observe its highs and occasional quirks closely.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The look of this coffee urn screams simple yet functional. Its silver aluminum finish gives it a sleek, professional appearance, perfect for fitting into events or bustling kitchens without drawing excessive attention. It’s also surprisingly lightweight at just 4 pounds, making it easier to move around than I expected for something that brews up to 45 cups. The twist-lock lid and wide, comfortable handles felt both sturdy and secure when carrying the urn—an important feature when transporting hot liquids. However, being made of aluminum, it does lack the heavier durability of options constructed from stainless steel, which might disappoint those looking for a more premium feel.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Using this coffee urn for brewing couldn’t be easier. The clear water level markings inside ensure you know precisely the amount of water or coffee being prepared. The ready-to-serve light is a thoughtful addition, so there’s no guessing or confusion about when your brew is ready. I especially appreciated the 2-way dispenser—it allows for quick dispensing with a single press or lets you lock it for continuous filling, a must-have when using larger mugs or travel cups. However, cleaning the urn was a slight hassle since it’s not dishwasher-safe, which would have been a time-saver for someone with a packed schedule.

**Check [Hamilton Beach 40515R] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Brewing**  
Calling this a “quick brewing” urn isn’t an overstatement. At just about a minute per cup, you can brew for a room full of guests without sacrificing too much time—trust me, the difference is noticeable during large events. What stood out to me was the ability to adjust the brewing quantity; it efficiently brewed just as well for smaller groups as it did for larger gatherings. Even better, the coffee stayed warm without any burnt or bitter taste. While the urn excels with coffee, I also tried brewing tea for a change. Though successful, I had to rinse the internal components more carefully afterward to prevent flavor mixing during future coffee sessions.

**Advantages**  
- Quick brewing: Around 1 minute per cup.  
- Can accommodate 15-45 cups, making it flexible for both small and large gatherings.  
- Two-way dispenser adds versatility for different cup styles.  
- Compact for its capacity; easier to transport with secure handles.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Aluminum construction feels more delicate compared to stainless steel counterparts.  
- Not dishwasher-safe, which makes cleaning more labor-intensive.  
- The lack of insulation can cause the exterior to heat when in use.  

**Target Users**  
This coffee urn seems most suited for those hosting social events, church gatherings, or office meetings where time-efficient brewing and high capacity are appealing. It’s also a good fit for people with a straightforward coffee-drinking routine, as it doesn’t come with extravagant features. However, if you’re looking for a premium device with advanced customization (like precise temperature controls), this isn’t it—but let’s remember, not everyone needs those extra bells and whistles.

**Competing Products**  
During my research, I compared it to the West Bend 58002 commercial coffee urn and the Hamilton Beach 45 Cup Dual Spout model. The West Bend, featuring a polished stainless steel finish, is undeniably more robust but also heftier and more expensive. It doesn’t brew faster, though, and Hamilton Beach holds the edge regarding lightweight portability. On the other hand, the brand’s dual-spout alternative appealed if serving two types of beverages was the goal, but this comes at a premium price, which might not justify buying it over the simpler single-spout version unless that feature truly matters.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Speaking in terms of budget-friendly solutions, this urn does great for what it’s designed for. Higher-end rivals are often overkill unless you need commercial-grade durability for constant use. The accessible price range combined with the rich features makes this coffee dispenser a smart choice for most households or small businesses. While not exactly aiming to excel in luxury or innovation, what you get instead is great reliability without breaking the bank.

1mjasos,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mjasos/unknown_caller_keeps_spamming_my_work_phone_they/,Unknown caller keeps spamming my work phone. They want me to confess to a murder.,"I‘m typing this in the lunchroom in between meetings because I need to know if anybody else is currently experiencing this or has in the past. 

I‘m a low-ranking junior executive at my white collar job that I have had for the past 2 years or so. My daily tasks mostly revolve around dealing with clients, trying to sell them our services and answering the occasional email from management. The job isn‘t very high stakes and pays quite well, so I haven‘t had much to complain about (with the exception of a few minor petty squabbles with older coworkers when I first started out as a new hire.) I‘m not the most social or extroverted person but I stick around for gossip every now and then, which is how I know that noone else at my workplace has been dealing with what I now call the „spammer.“ I asked my colleagues about their opinions on the whole situation and some of them told me to post on here – mostly because it‘s a bizzare story and in part because they insist that other people might be able to relate, as hard as I find it to believe that anybody else was targeted in a similar manner.

It started out simple enough. Another Wednesday at work, I was sitting hunched over at my desk, doomscrolling on TikTok– as was my usual routine for the hours past noon when my lunch was sitting heavy in my stomach and I was fighting the urge to fall asleep right then and there at my desk. I always find it hard to focus at that time of day, and the sun was bearing down on my office building, heating up the cramped space and casting everything in a feverish orange glow. The AC had been down for a couple of days at this point and maintenance hadn’t made an effort to fix it yet, so I was fighting a headache that kept growing with the steady flashing of the cursor on my opened Word document. Some girl on screen was reviewing colorful pastries, her bright cheerful voice blasting through my headphones. I lowered the volume until all I could hear was a faint murmur in the background of my lunchbreak lethargy.

Blink. Blink. Blink. Bzzzz.

Just as I was about to nod off, a rhythmic buzzing sound shook me awake. I glanced at my phone screen warily, not thrilled to be taking another unscheduled meeting call with yet another overbearing manager or less than pleased client.
Putting on my best customer service voice, I picked up the call.

""Hello, this is ___ speaking, how can-""

Before I could get another word in, the voice on the other line interrupted me roughly.

""Cut the bullshit. I know who you are. And you know that you can‘t tell anyone about this, so listen up.""

Irritated, I lowered my phone and stared at the number on screen, or rather, lack thereof. Unknown caller, no ID, and not a voice I was familiar with. The person speaking seemed to be male and middle aged, with a gravelly deep voice hoarse from smoking. At the time, I thought they had simply called the wrong number, as barely anybody outside my clients and my company knew how to reach me on my work phone.

""I‘m sorry, who is this? It seems like you dialed the wrong-""

""Don’t you worry, I got the right one. This is ___ from (Company), isn‘t it?""

I blinked, forcing myself to stick to protocol.

""Yes, that‘s me. Would you like to learn more about our services? Right now we offer exlusive deals to anyone who signs up for our insurance package before August 1st–""

""I‘m not here to talk about whatever shit you have got going on the side,"" the voice barked at me, startlingly loud even through the tiny speakers. I winced, gnawing at my bottom lip to keep myself from firing back a retort. These were the types of clients I hated dealing with the most. The type that found their joy in letting out their anger on whatever unsuspecting person was on the other end of the line, without having any interest in actually carrying a conversation.

""I understand,"" I grit out between gnashed teeth, unable to keep my tone from slipping. „Is there anything I can help you with?""

The voice was silent for a while, long enough for me to hope that they had simply hung up on the call. A look at my display betrayed that hope. The call was still connected, the timer counting the seconds uninterrupted. My thumb hovered over the circular red icon, slipping closer, and suddenly there was a sharp exhale and a rustle, like whoever it was I was speaking to had shifted closer.

""The body.""

My brows furrowed. Surely I had misunderstood.

""I want to know where you hid the evidence.""

""Excuse me?""

""You thought you tied up all the strings, huh? So nobody else would get behind it. I applaud your efforts."" Another deep, rattling breath. ""But I still remember that day, can’t forget about it. It sticks with me. Although I doubt you even remember his face. Unfortunate, how often these things happen, and somehow, the blame never falls on the ones who did it.""

My heart was beating wildly in my chest at this point.

""I think you have the wrong person, sir. I‘m going to hang up now.""

""I‘ve told the others about you, the work you do, and trust me, they‘re already looking for you. Just a matter of time now. There’s so much blood on your hands, I‘d take my chances and come clean now. Not that it would help your case much. ""

The voice had taken on a darkly satisfied, almost vicious tone. With trembling fingers, I fumbled around for the ""End call button"", repeating over and over in my head that it was likely just a drunk man‘s incoherent rambles and that everyone got these sort of unpleasant calls every once in a while. Nothing I should feel so shaken up by.

""Goodbye,"" I yelped and basically slammed my phone on the table once the call had disconnected, pushing myself up and out of my chair to clutch a shaking hand against my chest, fingers digging deep into the collar of my freshly ironed button up.
I reported the call to HR and talked to my supervisor who told me to just ignore it. Block and move on was the standard procedure, only that we didn‘t have any number to block so all I could do was pray that the man, whoever it had been, had gotten his sick enjoyment from our interaction and moved on.

Except he keeps calling.

Every morning I wake up with dread, preparing to face another day of mysterious phone harassment. Even the sound of a phone buzzing on the subway on my way to work is enough to make my gut sink and fill my stomach with a horrible nauseous feeling.

I have tried to ignore it as best as I can and not pick up but it still gets to me. When I do decide to confront him, it‘s the same play, each and every time. After a few general threats to my safety, the man demands to know where I hid the body, and hangs up promising me that ""they"" are closing in on me. Never any further explanation, and he never answers my question about who ""they"" are and whose body I apparently took and hid either.

I don‘t know if I‘m taking this too seriously or not seriously enough, but quite frankly, i‘m scared shitless and I don‘t know what to do. I don‘t think I can go to the police about this, since I don‘t think they‘ll care about a couple of cases of morbid prank calling. I‘ve considered asking my supervisor to give me a new work phone, but the explanation that I don‘t want the spammer to reach me sounds weird even to my ears.

I‘m still not sure if this is a case of mistaken identity or the world‘s most long-winded prank but if it‘s the latter, it has long stopped being funny. Besides, the caller, whoever it is, appears to be familiar enough with my place of work and my schedules to know when I‘m taking my lunch break, which is when he chooses to call, and that above all terrifies me the most. I feel watched at all times. Even typing this next to the big coffee machine in our lunch room that at least partially hides me from sight, I get the suspicion that he will catch wind of me reaching out and probably redouble his terrors.

To be absolutely clear: I did not kill anybody. Or hid anyone‘s body. I‘m a small woman in my mid twenties and I‘m about as straight laced as they come. Average height, average name, average upbringing. There’s likely a thousand people just like me working at this company, and yet I was singled out. The assumption that I commited a crime as grave as the one I‘m being accused of puzzles me to this day.

I will update this if things get better –or worse. Please only send serious suggestions. This is a true story and it has become a constant source of stress and worry for me. I‘m honestly afraid to show up to work now, fearing that one day ""they"" might really show up and do god knows what to me. I guess I no longer have to fear falling asleep during my lunchbreak. Of course, I would take the drowsiness and lack of energy over the rapid pounding of my heart and the horrible sinking feeling in my gut any day, as I can do nothing but sit and wait for the next call to light up my screen.

1mjarvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1mjarvs/my_makesyoufluent_review/,My MakesYouFluent Review,"TL;DR:

MakesYouFluent is an outstanding app for those looking to improve their speaking and listening skills in a new language. The face-to-face avatar calls and role-play scenarios (ordering coffee, job interviews) make it stand out for real-world practice, especially for intermediate learners who want to gain confidence speaking without fear of judgment. The recent UI updates have made it much more beginner-friendly, but there's still room for improvement in areas like grammar exercises. If you're serious about learning to speak confidently and naturally, MakesYouFluent is worth a try.

Now for the long version:

General Experience:

I've been using MakesYouFluent consistently for about a year, focusing on learning both German and French. I was mostly attracted by the face-to-face AI tutor feature. The idea of having a virtual conversation with an AI ""person"" was intriguing, and it felt like a novel way to tackle language learning. I was curious to see if this approach would help me overcome the common hurdle of speaking anxiety when learning a new language.

Features & Usability:

One of the standout features of MakesYouFluent is the ""Call Mode"" with famous personas. For example, I can have a conversation with an AI version of Einstein whenever I want. This not only makes the learning process more engaging but also adds a fun, interactive element that traditional language apps lack. The avatar face-to-face calls are incredibly well-designed, with natural speech patterns and lifelike interactions that kinda make you forget you're talking to an AI bot.

When I first started using the app, I found the interface a bit challenging, especially for beginners. Navigation wasn't intuitive, and it was easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options and features. Over time, it’s pretty clear the devs have listened to user feedback. They've reworked the UI, improved navigation, and introduced a beginner-friendly learning plan that guides users through the app step-by-step. This has significantly improved accessibility and ease of use.

The app's lesson structure is less rigid than other language-learning platforms. Instead of following a strict curriculum, MakesYouFluent encourages a more self-directed approach. The focus is heavily on speaking and getting out of your comfort zone, perfect for those who struggle with the fear of making mistakes. This emphasis on real-world practice over theoretical learning is one of the app's strongest points.

Learning Approach:

MakesYouFluent follows a flexible learning model that adapts to the language level you choose, letting you decide what and how you want to learn without rigid personalized paths. This balance gives you structure while still allowing freedom in your learning, which can be a refreshing change from more rigid apps.

The app places a strong emphasis on listening and speaking, which I found incredibly beneficial. While there are vocabulary exercises available to help you prepare before diving into conversations, grammar takes a backseat. This might not suit everyone, especially those who prefer a more balanced approach to language learning that includes reading and writing.

The AI avatar system in MakesYouFluent is a neat feature imo. It’s a chatbot you can practice conversations with at any time, which makes learning feel a bit more natural. A nice way to get more speaking practice without the pressure.

Comparison with Other Apps:

Compared to other language-learning platforms like Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone, MakesYouFluent focuses much more on practical speaking skills rather than structured lessons. I find it to be a perfect complement to Duolingo, in the sense that you can use Duolingo for grammar and vocabulary drills and MakesYouFluent for speaking practice. This combination has been incredibly effective in accelerating my language learning.

The variety of personas and tutors you can choose from is another feature that sets MakesYouFluent apart. It provides a flexible learning experience, even though the learning path itself isn’t customized. This flexibility allows you to tailor your learning experience to your interests and needs.

Progress & Results:

Since I started using MakesYouFluent, I’ve noticed some improvements in my language skills, especially in speaking confidence. After a few weeks, I was able to successfully order dinner in German during my Berlin trip without overthinking too much. The app tracks progress with things like streaks and lesson completion, which can be useful for staying on track.

That said, while it does send push notifications as reminders, what kept me coming back was the interactive conversations rather than the gamified tracking. It’s satisfying to complete a challenging dialogue, though I can see how some users might prefer more structured progress indicators.

Community & Support:

The support team at MakesYouFluent has been responsive and helpful in my experience. I had a small technical issue early on, and they resolved it efficiently while keeping me updated. That said, I’ve seen quite a few people mention that support can be slow or that they mostly get automated replies. While I did receive an automated message saying it might take some time to get a response, I still got a reply fairly quickly, so it seems to depend on the situation.

I’ve seen some mixed reviews online, likely from earlier versions when the interface was less intuitive or expectations weren’t fully met. In my experience, support was responsive, and the app has improved a lot since then; it’s now smoother to navigate, more beginner-friendly, and clearly shaped by user feedback.

Monetization & Value:

MakesYouFluent operates on a subscription model, offering various plans to suit different needs. The All Language Pass is probably the best value if you’re interested in learning multiple languages. The app is ad-free, which for a paid app is a given but sadly not an assured thing with how things are going, and the clean, modern UI makes for a distraction-free learning experience.

That said, the biggest issue I had was the lack of a free trial. It feels a bit odd that there’s no way to test out the app, even for a week, before committing to a subscription. It would be helpful to get a feel for the features and interface before deciding whether it’s worth paying for.

Final Thoughts:

If you already have some basics in a language and want to get better at speaking, MakesYouFluent is definitely worth a look. It’s a good option for practicing real conversations and building confidence without the usual classroom feel.

That said, there’s still room for improvement. More grammar exercises could help balance out the focus on speaking and listening. The app’s UI has improved a lot, but there’s always space for a bit more polish and the occasional bug fix.

Overall, MakesYouFluent has been a really useful tool in my language-learning journey. Its approach is engaging, and the focus on practical skills makes it stand out among other language apps. If you’re looking for more speaking practice, it’s worth giving it a try.",0,1754500875.0,languagelearning,1,0.38,False

Most folks aren't used to partnering up in business. They think you either work for someone Or that someone works for you. The idea of splitting profits with a business owner can sound intimidating. I used to think the same thing.

But now I see folks partnering with people and businesses almost every day. It’s a whole new way of looking at the situation.

But one time I flew to Jamaica. And we splurged for the VIP lounge at the airport. It was a completely different experience.

People were relaxed. We had real conversations over cocktails and appetizers. It was totally worth it. The VIP lounge experience got the trip off to the perfect start.

1mjar7u,https://i.redd.it/nppwcvyonfhf1.jpeg,Crays Circle – Building the Offline‑First Social Layer of the Future,"# Outgrowing Bluetooth‑only mesh networks

In July 2025 Jack Dorsey’s team released BitChat, an experimental messaging app that showed how phones can relay encrypted text across a Bluetooth mesh. With no logins and no servers, BitChat messages jump from phone to phone within roughly a 100 m range and can be forwarded across several hops to reach 300 m. The whitepaper stresses strong privacy: sessions use the Noise Protocol with Curve25519 and AES‑GCM encryption, and there is no metadata collection. Yet BitChat’s very strengths reveal its limits. Because identity is a random Bluetooth identifier and there is no authentication layer, impersonation is easy. The network remains constrained by Bluetooth Low Energy bandwidth and range, and if there are no nearby devices acting as relays then messages simply vanish. Tech reviewers warned that the application had not undergone independent security reviews and that fake copies were already circulating.

Crays Circle takes the energy of BitChat’s experiment and lifts it into a robust offline‑first ecosystem. Instead of relying solely on Bluetooth, the network rests on an open, high‑throughput wireless standard called Wi‑Fi Aware. Wi‑Fi Aware (also known as Neighbor Awareness Networking) allows devices to discover and exchange data directly via Wi‑Fi without routers or cellular base stations. Devices continuously discover peers using a combination of BLE for wake‑up and Wi‑Fi for data transfer, achieving hundreds of Mbps throughput and ranges over 100 m. It includes sub‑meter ranging and rotating identifiers for privacy, making it a far more capable backbone than Bluetooth. In Crays Circle, Bluetooth LE becomes a fallback for devices that lack Wi‑Fi Aware support, but the core mesh benefits from the open specification and cross‑vendor support of the Wi‑Fi Alliance. This shift alone allows our network to carry high‑quality audio/video streams, enable accurate positioning inside venues and deliver far greater resilience to interference.

# The DNC Protocol – a self‑healing networking foundation

At the heart of Crays Circle lies the Decentralized Node Communication (DNC) Protocol. Whereas BitChat is essentially a single mobile app, DNC is a layered networking protocol designed to support many applications. The DNC README describes it as “the Internet, but peer‑to‑peer”. Its primary goal is true infrastructure independence – the protocol works without internet, cell towers or ISPs and automatically forms self‑healing mesh networks that route around failures. DNC bridges multiple radio technologies: Wi‑Fi Aware, Bluetooth LE and LoRa, with automatic peer discovery and connection management so your devices find each other without manual configuration. This multi‑transport design means Crays Circle can function in dense urban spaces, remote rural villages or even across continents via LoRa relays.

Security and trust are baked into the protocol. All communications are end‑to‑end encrypted and the protocol uses a public key infrastructure without central authorities. Byzantine fault tolerance ensures consensus on shared state, and the team is preparing quantum‑resistant cryptography for future threats. DNC adapts to real‑world conditions: it employs adaptive routing based on signal strength and latency, uses battery‑efficient algorithms and gracefully degrades in challenging RF environments. An AI‑enhanced network intelligence layer uses machine‑learning to optimize routing, predict peer availability and tune protocol parameters. This intelligence is crucial for the “smart matching” and context‑aware features that set Crays Circle apart.

Scalability isn’t an afterthought: DNC uses a hierarchical addressing scheme and efficient message propagation algorithms that support millions of concurrent nodes and interoperate with existing internet protocols. The README’s architecture diagram shows the protocol sitting between an application layer and various transport adapters such as Wi‑Fi Aware, Bluetooth LE, LoRa and Wi‑Fi Direct. Above this foundation, any number of applications can run – not just social networking, but file sharing, offline payments, sensor networks and more.

# From phones to nodes – the Crays Circle app

The first flagship application built on DNC is the Crays Circle app, available for iOS and Android. Its README declares: “Your phone is no longer a device. It’s a node”. Crays Circle transforms smartphones into light nodes that plug into the DNC mesh. Key features include:

1. Offline‑first mesh networking – even without any internet connection, devices can chat, share content and discover each other using the DNC protocol. This makes Crays Circle invaluable during concerts, festivals, power outages and rural gatherings.
2. Psychology‑driven matching – instead of random broadcast, users can choose to reveal MBTI, Big Five, Process Communication or Enneagram traits. The app’s matching algorithm finds compatible people nearby, whether for social, dating or business purposes. Such deep personalization goes well beyond BitChat’s faceless chatroom.
3. Intention‑based discovery – users set their current intention (networking, romance, collaboration), and the app surfaces relevant nodes. This reduces noise and fosters meaningful connections.
4. Privacy‑first decentralization – all personal data stays on the device; there are no centralized servers harvesting metadata.
5. Venue‑aware interactions – Crays Circle integrates with physical spaces like co‑working hubs, music festivals and coffee shops. Super nodes installed in venues amplify the mesh and enable location‑specific experiences.
6. Crypto payments and tokenized access – using Crays Coin and the built‑in wallet, users can send tips, pay for goods and access token‑gated experiences offline.

These features are only possible because DNC’s mesh can carry more than text. Audio messages, photos, decentralized web apps and micropayments flow over Wi‑Fi Aware at high speed. When no Wi‑Fi Aware radios are available, the stack falls back to Bluetooth LE. Unlike BitChat’s one‑size‑fits‑all approach, Crays Circle can gracefully degrade while still maintaining robust functionality.

# Crays Super Nodes – the signal boost and blockchain bridge

Phones alone cannot provide city‑wide or campus‑wide coverage, so Crays Circle introduces Super Nodes. In the Crays Circle architecture diagram, light nodes (mobile devices) connect to Super Node hardware and to a blockchain layer. Super Nodes are small, ARM‑based devices with 4 GB+ of RAM, Wi‑Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 support, and the ability to sync with blockchains like Ethereum or the Mantra chain. They perform several roles:

* Mesh traffic relay and signal boost – Super Nodes run high‑gain antennas and maintain persistent Wi‑Fi Aware clusters. They broadcast DNC beacons over a wider area and relay packets across multiple hops, extending the network far beyond the radius of individual smartphones.
* Validation and content caching – these nodes store caches of user profiles, micro‑web applications and local feeds. They also validate transactions and interactions, acting as a middle layer between the offline network and the blockchain.
* Bridge between L1/L2 – by syncing with the Ethereum or MANTRA blockchain, Super Nodes allow offline actions to eventually settle on‑chain when connectivity returns. They handle wallet state updates, token issuance and on‑chain identity proofs.

In rural communities a solar‑powered Super Node could provide a local “offline internet” by caching educational materials and essential services. In an urban festival, multiple Super Nodes mesh together to deliver rich media and handle thousands of simultaneous connections. Because the hardware is open, communities can build their own and run local validators, ensuring sovereignty over their data and governance.

# Human‑centric social layer and Nostr integration

Crays Circle is not just a networking protocol; it’s a social technology layer for building communities. The app encourages authentic interaction by letting users share their interests, talents and emotional states. Venue‑based discovery surfaces people with shared intentions. The matching algorithms are inspired by neuroscience and behavioral psychology rather than superficial swipes. Community hosts can design micro‑web apps that run offline – from local discussion forums to collaborative art spaces – and publish them into the mesh.

To connect local communities to the broader Web3 ecosystem, Crays Circle embraces Nostr, the open protocol for censorship‑resistant messaging. Nostr uses public keys and relay servers to allow anyone to publish and subscribe to global notes. In Crays Circle, each user’s identity is a pair of cryptographic keys used across DNC and Nostr. Super Nodes can operate Nostr relays, bridging offline content to the global network when intermittent internet is available. This combination gives communities full autonomy offline while remaining connected to the world when desired. Nostr’s simple design ensures account portability and avoids vendor lock‑in, aligning with Crays Circle’s ethos of openness and user empowerment.

# Empowering use cases beyond chat

Because DNC is transport‑agnostic and application‑agnostic, Crays Circle opens up a universe of possibilities:

* Emergency communications – The protocol’s use cases section emphasises disaster response, first‑responder coordination and community broadcast systems. When earthquakes or floods take down cellular networks, Crays Circle becomes a lifeline.
* Privacy‑focused applications – Anonymous file sharing, censorship‑resistant forums and private social networks are native to the DNC stack.
* IoT and industrial networks – Smart city sensors, agricultural fields and factories can use DNC to coordinate without centralized infrastructure. For instance, sensors could send soil moisture data to a farmer’s phone over Wi‑Fi Aware.
* Entertainment and social gatherings – Local multiplayer gaming, cross‑venue reconnection and token‑gated events become seamless. At a conference, attendees can exchange contact info and digital business cards by simply being nearby.

# Roadmap and vision

Crays Circle is still at the beginning of its journey. The roadmap outlines Phase 1 (2025) – the foundation: building the core mesh networking protocol, releasing the first iOS/Android app, integrating personality matching and forming initial venue partnerships. Phase 2 (2026) – expansion plans to onboard hundreds of venues, develop advanced AI features and launch decentralized governance. Phase 3 (2030+) – ecosystem envisions a world with thousands of venues and 250 million users, full Web3 integration and tokenized real estate. These milestones demonstrate that Crays Circle isn’t a fleeting experiment; it’s an ambitious plan to build a new social infrastructure where communities own their communication channels.

# Why this matters

The fragility of today’s centralized internet is becoming apparent. Wildfires, power outages and political censorship routinely cut communities off from one another. The success of BitChat shows there is appetite for resilient, peer‑to‑peer communication, but it also reveals the need for better identity management, higher throughput and broader range. Crays Circle answers that call. By combining a powerful wireless backbone (Wi‑Fi Aware), a sophisticated multi‑radio protocol (DNC), psychology‑driven social features and open protocols like Nostr, it creates an offline‑first social web layer that is both technologically advanced and deeply human.

As the DNC README boldly states, this is “the Internet, but peer‑to‑peer”. Crays Circle envisions cities and villages dotted with Super Nodes; smartphones that quietly discover like‑minded people nearby; artists releasing micro‑performances over mesh networks; emergency responders coordinating without cell towers; local economies flourishing with offline payments. It invites each of us to be a node, to own our identity and connections, and to build communities that are resilient, sovereign and free.",1,1754500832.0,Crays,0,1.0,False

His face was frozen in a grimace of surprise.

“Meet Alex Stevens,” said Clara, pointing to the screen. “Twenty-three years old, a popular streamer. Last night at 9:30 PM, he died live on air in front of forty thousand viewers.”

Reed leaned back in his chair, studying the image.
“Intriguing. What’s the preliminary cause of death?”

“Heart attack,” answered Jacobs, flipping through the report. “He’d been playing a new game for six hours straight, drinking energy drinks, clearly overexcited.”

“But?” Reed narrowed his eyes. “I sense there’s a ‘but.’”

Laura hit play on the video.
“See for yourselves. Alex is commentating, laughing, interacting with the chat. Then suddenly, he grabs his chest, says, ‘What the hell…’ and collapses. No one else is present. The door was locked from the inside. Eighth-floor windows.”

“Classic natural death,” muttered Dr. Pendleton. “Young people abuse stimulants; the body gives out.”

“Then why were we called in?” Clara asked.

Jacobs raised a hand.
“His parents insisted on an investigation. Said he never had heart issues. Also, he received several threatening messages the day before.”

Laura opened her laptop and connected it to the big screen.
“I analyzed the entire stream. Three hours of footage, every minute. Alex seemed perfectly healthy and energetic until the very end.”

“What about the threats?” Reed asked.

“Now that’s interesting.” Laura opened the chat logs.
“During the stream, he received the usual fan messages. But thirty minutes before he died, a user named DiabloKiller666 appeared.”

Messages flashed on screen:

""Alex, you’re playing with fire""
""Soon you’ll know what a real game is""
""The last level will truly be your last""

“Standard internet troll threats,” Clara remarked skeptically.

“Perhaps,” Reed agreed. “But let’s look closer. Laura, rewind to the moment of death again.”

The video slowed. Alex was enthusiastically commentating, his fingers flying across the keyboard. Suddenly, he jerked, clutched his chest, and collapsed.

“Pause,” Reed leaned forward. “Go back thirty seconds. Watch his reaction.”

“Watch what, exactly?” asked Jacobs.

“What he’s looking at,” Reed replied. “Ten seconds before the collapse, Alex suddenly turns his head to the left. Nothing happens in the game. The chat is quiet. What distracted him?”

Laura zoomed in.
“Could be something off-camera? A sound from another room?”

“Or someone showed him something beyond the webcam’s view,” Clara suggested.

Dr. Pendleton examined the autopsy report.
“Heart failure confirmed, but toxicology isn’t back yet. Though there’s one odd detail — his pupils were unusually dilated.”

“Drugs?” Jacobs asked.

“Or extreme fear,” Reed said thoughtfully. “Doctor, is it possible to die from shock?”

“Technically, yes. A sudden adrenaline surge can trigger cardiac arrest in someone predisposed.”

Alex Stevens’ apartment was in a modern high-rise. His gaming room resembled a professional studio — multiple monitors, high-end camera, soundproofed walls.

“The door really was locked from the inside,” confirmed Jacobs. “The concierge used a spare key in the morning when the parents became concerned.”

Reed circled the room, examining everything closely.
“Interesting layout. Alex sat with his back to the window, facing the door. The webcam only captured him and part of the desk.”

“What’s this?” Laura pointed to a small mirror on the wall left of the computer.

“Good eye,” Reed nodded approvingly. “See the angle? The mirror would reflect whatever’s behind Alex.”

Clara walked to the window.
“Eighth floor. Across from here is an office building. Most windows are dark, but...”

She pulled out binoculars and peered through.
“Interesting. One of the offices still has its lights on, with large windows directly opposite Alex’s apartment.”

The Central Tower office building was mostly empty in the evenings, but the security guard confirmed someone had worked late in office 815 the night before.

“That’s the office of a marketing agency — Creative Solutions,” said Jacobs. “Leased by a Daniel Richards.”

The office was small — a few desks, computers, and a huge window with a clear view of the apartment.

“Mr. Richards,” Clara introduced herself, flashing her badge. “We’re investigating the death of Alex Stevens. Did you know him?”

Daniel Richards, a nervous-looking man in his mid-thirties, shook his head.
“Never heard of him.”

“Strange,” said Reed, approaching the window. “You’ve got a perfect view of his apartment. Were you working late last night?”

“Yes, until about 10 PM. Tight deadline.”

“See anything unusual?”

“No, I was focused on work.”

Laura examined the office.
“What’s this equipment?” She pointed at a professional camera on a tripod near the window.

Richards laughed nervously.
“Oh, that? We film promotional videos. Sometimes we use the city view as background.”

Back at CID West, the team gathered to review the case.

“I don’t like that guy,” Clara said. “Too nervous for an innocent bystander.”

“Laura, can you dig into his background?” Reed asked.

“Already on it,” she replied, typing rapidly. “Daniel Richards. Thirty-six. Divorced a year ago. Worked for several IT companies. Been running Creative Solutions for the past three years.”

“What about his finances?”

“Now here’s the twist — the agency is nearly bankrupt. He hasn’t paid office rent in six months.”

Jacobs chimed in.
“I checked security footage from Alex’s building. No one suspicious entered yesterday.”

“So if this was murder, the killer acted remotely,” Reed said. “Doctor, any updates on toxicology?”

Dr. Pendleton nodded.
“Just came in. High levels of adrenaline in Alex’s blood. No drugs or poisons.”

“Fear, then,” Reed concluded. “Something or someone scared him terribly.”

“Laura, is there any way to analyze what Alex saw just before his death?” Clara asked.

“In theory, yes. If the mirror reflected anything unusual, I can enhance the image.”

Laura worked for hours, applying filters and enhancing the mirror’s reflection.

“Got it!” she exclaimed. “Look here.”

On the screen appeared a blurry but visible shape — the mirror showed a window, and in that window, a silhouette holding something.

“That’s a camera,” Reed said. “Someone was filming Alex from the office opposite.”

“Still not a crime,” Jacobs objected. “Creepy, but not murder.”

“What if it wasn’t just spying?” Reed began to pace. “What if Alex recognized whoever was filming him?”

“Jacobs, check any connections between Alex and Richards,” Clara instructed.

An hour later, Jacobs returned with a lead.

“I found it! Three years ago, Richards worked at GameDev Studio. Alex was a beta tester for them at the time.”

“Go on,” Reed encouraged.

“Richards was fired for embezzlement. He was stealing game codes and selling them. Alex was one of the testers who caught him.”

“Motive!” Laura exclaimed. “Richards blamed Alex for ruining his career.”

“But how did he kill him?” Jacobs asked, puzzled.

Reed stood before the case board.
“What if the murder was psychological? Richards knew Alex’s schedule. Watched his streams. This wasn’t the first time.”

“I have a plan,” said Reed. “But we’ll need help.”

The plan was simple yet elegant. The team contacted Alex’s younger brother, who sometimes helped with his setup. He agreed to stage a “memorial stream.”

That evening, the brother sat at the same computer in the same room. Hidden surveillance was set up, and the CID team observed from the neighboring apartment.

“Going live,” the brother whispered over the radio.

Thirty minutes later, a light flicked on across the street.

“She took the bait,” Laura whispered.

Richards appeared in the office window, camera in hand, clearly filming.

“Time for the twist,” Reed said into the mic. “Show him the sign.”

The brother lifted a paper that read: ""HELLO, DANIEL. THE POLICE ARE COMING.""

Richards recoiled in shock. The camera slipped from his hands.

At the station, Daniel Richards slumped in his chair, avoiding eye contact.

“I didn’t mean to kill him,” he finally said. “I was just… watching.”

“Start from the beginning,” Clara said gently.

“After I was fired, everything fell apart. My wife left, debts piled up. I blamed those who exposed me. Alex most of all.”

“So you decided to get revenge?”

“At first, I just watched. Filmed him. Learned his routines. I thought I’d find dirt, ruin his reputation.”

“But something went wrong,” Reed said.

Richards nodded.
“Last night, he suddenly turned and looked straight at me. I knew he saw me. I panicked. I turned on a laser pointer — just to blind him for a second.”

“A laser pointer?” Jacobs blinked.

“I aimed it at his eyes. But he suddenly clutched his chest and collapsed. I didn’t understand what had happened until I saw the news.”

Dr. Pendleton listened, then said,
“It fits. A sudden laser in the dark can cause extreme shock. Alex had a latent heart condition. The fear triggered ventricular fibrillation.”

“So he literally died of fear?” Jacobs asked.

“Technically, yes. But legally, this is involuntary manslaughter. Richards created the circumstances that caused the death.”

Laura raised her hand.
“One thing — we never found the laser.”

“I threw it away. In the trash,” Richards admitted. “It should be at the landfill.”

A week later, the case was closed. Daniel Richards was charged with involuntary manslaughter and stalking.

“A tragic case,” Clara said, closing the file. “A young, talented man died because of someone else’s revenge.”

“What strikes me more,” Reed added, “is that the killer was visible to forty thousand people — and no one noticed him.”

“The modern world,” Dr. Pendleton said philosophically. “We live in glass houses, yet remain alone.”

Laura looked up from her computer.
“By the way, I checked Alex’s other recent streams. Richards had been watching for at least three weeks. You can see reflections of his camera.”

“Shame the parents didn’t come to us sooner,” Jacobs sighed.

“They didn’t know there was something to notice,” Reed replied. “In the digital age, stalking takes new forms. We need to stay ahead.”

A month later, the CID West team received a letter from Alex’s parents:

“Thank you for not letting our son become just another statistic in the list of sudden young deaths. Now we know the truth, and we can live with that.”

Standing by the window with coffee in hand, Reed spoke softly:

“You know what amazed me most in this case?”

“What?” Clara asked.

“That the killer used fear as a weapon. Not poison. Not bullets. Just fear. In a way, it was almost the perfect crime.”

“But not perfect enough to remain unsolved,” Laura smiled.

“Because he forgot one thing,” Jacobs added. “Us.”

Dr. Pendleton set aside his medical journal.

“I wonder how many more such cases we’ll face. The internet is changing the very nature of crime.”

“Then we’ll have to change with it,” Clara said firmly. “If criminals evolve, so must we.”

1mjanvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForceTech/comments/1mjanvi/should_you_buy_the_best_renewed_laptop_hp/,Should You Buy the Best Renewed Laptop HP EliteBook 840 G6,"Testing out the HP EliteBook 840 G6 has been an everyday journey filled with both productivity-enhancing features and a few quirks that caught my attention. Packed with an 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8365U processor running at 1.6GHz, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a speedy 256GB PCIe SSD, it’s a machine that promises to deliver on performance, and in many ways, it does. As someone constantly juggling between work documents, a ton of tabs, and some light photo editing, I relied on this laptop for weeks to see if it could keep up with my demands. Let's dive into the experience and see how this laptop stacks up to its reputation.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the EliteBook 840 G6 feels sleek and professional, with its silver, lightweight chassis. Weighing just about 3.36 pounds and measuring 0.7 inches in thickness, it’s portable enough to take just about anywhere, whether it’s a coffee shop, a coworking space, or even my living room couch. The 14-inch display with full HD resolution (1920x1080) is bright and vivid, though I noticed some glare when working outdoors. The keyboard offered a satisfying typing experience, with decent travel and spacing, although the backlight could use a bit more brightness for dimly lit rooms. Its minimalist and clean design makes it a strong candidate for professionals looking for something functional without unnecessary flash.

**Performance and Speed**  
Everyday performance is clearly where this laptop shines. The Intel Core i5 processor, coupled with 16GB of RAM, handled multitasking like a champ. Even with 20 Chrome tabs open, Zoom running in the background, and Microsoft Office in full swing, the system didn’t lag or stutter. The 256GB SSD delivers incredibly fast boot times and application launches, which is a big deal for someone like me who’s allergic to waiting. That said, the Intel UHD Graphics 620 is only sufficient for basic visual tasks, so any heavy gaming or graphic design projects are off the table.

**Ports and Connectivity**  
Connectivity is another strong point of this laptop. It comes with two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, an HDMI slot, and a headphone jack. I even tested it with an external monitor, and the process was seamless. The built-in WiFi (802.11abg) kept me connected without any noticeable drops or interference during video calls. While it lacks a USB-C port, which has become a standard for newer laptops, the available options made up for it during my use. 

[Grab HP EliteBook 840 G6 at the best price on Amazon.](https://headphonegeek.com/p/b08fcpqtdq/)

**Heat Management and Battery Life**  
While using the laptop for extended periods, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it managed heat. Even during demanding tasks like running a handful of browser windows and streaming 1080p video at the same time, it only got slightly warm at the base. The fan noise, on the other hand, can get a bit noticeable during intense workloads. The battery life lived up to its claims, providing a solid 6-7 hours of productivity before needing a recharge. While not groundbreaking, it’s sufficient for typical workdays, as long as you have a power outlet nearby.

**Merits**
- Lightweight and portable design perfect for travel or commutes.  
- Reliable multitasking performance with 16GB RAM and Intel Core i5 processor.  
- Fast boot times and application speeds thanks to the SSD.  
- High-quality build and sleek appearance.  

**Flaws**  
- Lacks a USB-C port, which feels like a missed opportunity in 2023.  
- The display, while crisp, struggles with glare under bright lighting.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing the HP EliteBook 840 G6 to competitors, a few key alternatives come to mind. For example, the Lenovo ThinkPad T480 is closely matched in terms of performance but offers better battery life and a more durable build. However, its bulkier design might not appeal to those who prioritize portability. Another contender is the Dell Latitude 5400, which shines in the area of display quality and port options, including USB-C, not found on the EliteBook. That said, if cost savings and professional design are priorities, the HP EliteBook stands strong among all three options.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Looking at the price-to-performance ratio of this laptop, it’s clear that you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck. It might not wave the flag of innovation with cutting-edge features, but it balances quality and performance at an affordable price point. For professionals or students needing a reliable and portable workstation without going overboard on their budget, this machine remains a worthy competitor in its segment.

The night before the baby shower, I was making them my oven was not working right so I had to use this little convection oven fryer thing that I’ve used before and we are also in the middle of a storm so my power kept flicking off and on, so I had to wait till the next day to bake them, but somehow managed to burn half of them and I brought them anyway
along with the cinnamon rolls, I brought a little gift of stuff that I had for my kids that look like stuff similar to her baby registry. (freshly washed no stains)

at her baby shower, while I was playing with my two older kids, one of the grandparents said that my cinnamon rolls were a teeth getr to my husband trying to warn him. My husband stood up for me and told her what happened and why they got burnt, I should’ve expected it but it still really hurt my feelings I did tried to let people know the we’re a little burnt but I guess didn't let everyone know. Moving to the gift I gave her a baby carrier that was just like the one on her registry, but a green color and a car seat cover I never used with a little book and a cow stuffy that my kids never play with because they have two of them. her boyfriend was confused about the baby carrier. And she called the stuffed animal a giraffe cow. but in her defense, it does look like one but it still made me really embarrassed about bringing it.

 I honestly think I really messed up by bringing anything, but she has done so much for me and my kids that I wanted to do something for her. The whole experience makes me honestly not wanna go to any other baby shower unless it’s close family. did I mess up should I have just gone and not brought anything?

I’m not doing this for it to get on an episod and if the friend I’m talking about sees this, I hope we can have a decent conversation instead of just get mad at each other. You’re honestly like a sister to me I appreciate and love you a lot.

This is the ikea grafjallet with the door left off.
We bought it in June to add to our bun’s cage.

He loves it, and it’s such an easy and inexpensive hack that I just had to share in case anyone is looking for an inexpensive, bunstruction-proof hidey hole or “hutch”.

Mochi lives in the living room. His cage is directly beside the couch in a “corner” (if you can call 1/4 of the room a “corner”). 
The table acts as a 2 story hidey with storage space, and doubles as an end table beside the couch if I need a spot to put my coffee.
He mostly hangs out underneath it, but he hopped up to the upper level today, which inspired me to share.

(Ps, yea he’s fully enclosed in the pictures. He free roams when we’re in the room with him. He likes getting under the couches, so we’re working on a way to block off couch access)

1mjalhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1mjalhd/spiritual_deception/,Spiritual Deception,"The following is what I posted in response to an older comment by someone stating that after praying a suggested 10 minute prayer of deliverance which was suggested to them by an ex satanist who is now a deliverance minister that their condition only worsened. He then replied to that individual that it was because it angered the demons….

I am sharing here, in part, as I am hopeful that some of what I experienced will be of help to others. But also because I feel so utterly alone. There is much more that I could share that I left out but I just want to caution others both when it comes to New Age deception that has been infiltrating the Body of Christ for some time. I also want to encourage both discernment and caution when it comes to blindly trusting deliverance ministries without fully vetting them beforehand. Finally I want to warn others to taking any sin in your life seriously. 

Everything points to it being too late for me but I still want to point others to Jesus Christ and hopefully something beneficial can come from my experience. 

Here was my reply:

What may have happened is that if they were not actually born again seven more came in just as Jesus warns can happen. I believed for over 45 years that I was a child of God and that Jesus became my personal Savior at the age of five. I grew up going to church and attending Christian schools. I began questioning my salvation a few years ago following an ultimately terrifying and largely spiritual psychosis that lasted a year and a half. It caused me to plunge into my Bible even more than in years past and I realized after listening to more and more personal testimonies; taking in more and more Christian content — including online Bible studies and teachings, and as I sought to center my life around God that I had lived most of my life as a carnal Christian. I repented and stopped sinning where I knew to and asked for help to overcome in other areas. I was finally baptized and believed that I was now truly born again. But no matter all the things I did to grow in my relationship — daily prayer starting with gratitude upon waking up and praying for personal direction; praying for others; submitting personal prayers for greater intimacy and grace in areas where I needed Christ’s healing in order to fully love Him, others, and myself as He commands…. I had even begun talking to the Lord and praying to Him throughout the day and for at least a couple of years by this time. I had also began to implement fasting. I eventually told Jesus that I surrender my life to Him as I thought that perhaps this was the problem — that I never asked Him to be Lord of my life. But despite daily reading and meditating on God’s word and worshiping through song and praise, nothing changed. I began to share Jesus with others and felt joy in doing so. I looked for opportunities to give to others and tithed regularly. I was doing all that I knew to do in my own strength and trusted that God would equip me with His as I began to memorize more and more of His promises. 

I couldn’t understand what I was doing wrong. I’d list people by name that I chose to forgive. I listened to a few online deliverance ministries that even cited lengthy prayers to break generational curses as well as to be prayed over as they attempted to deliver their audience from a list of potential demons that they may be possessed by. 

What ended up happening is that I began to experience these faith related external signs and synchronicities that at first shocked me — many including Scripture. But as I shared them with the pastor of a local church I had been attending he lovingly told me that He felt I should accept them as God speaking to me and that He found it not wise to question how God chooses to. They began to happen more and more and I embraced them. I also had the spontaneous thought, “I will sustain you” enter my mind one morning while highly anxious and as I was praying before even opening my eyes. I was so certain this must have been the Lord as the song, “I will Carry you” by Ellie Holcomb also came to mind as I looked up verses and just as I found Isaiah 46:4 as the first verse to come up. But then I also began to see repeating number patterns again which I had a decade ago during a time where I was very vulnerable and grieving the death of a close friend to suicide. I had also been listening to meditation videos during this time until I finally realized this was not okay and even though I experienced a sense of calm and peace it was unsettling because the Bible suddenly started to seem almost archaic and obsolete. That was enough for me to stop practicing meditation and to ignore what was then only seeing 11:11 frequently. I didn’t see these number patterns again until in the midst of the psychosis. This time I associated them with gematria which I was led to believe was biblical until I also realized it was another demonic deception tied to Jewish mysticism. 

The third time, which began early last year was also at a very vulnerable time when I was under daily harassment by a few fellow tenants within my building that seemed to collaborate to intimidate me through their actions and behavior. This included the frequent and constant slamming of both apartment doors and the side entrance just beside my apartment for hours at a time as well as frequent running back & forth past my window to enter and exit the building. For several weeks it also included their dogs spontaneously barking upon both exiting and entering the building. People began randomly coming outside at both midnight and at 3:00 a.m. as if on a schedule as I was sleeping in my common room and would be awoken by it. My upstairs neighbor flooded my apartment bathroom twice while he was home — once leaving his sink on for over two hours. I had carnations left on my window sill and strung around my interior door to the hallway which felt like it might be tied to witchcraft or black magic being performed against me. I was lied about by all three after contacting the office regarding erratic behavior; daily pot smoking that permeated hallways and came in through doors and windows. This seemed to start after witnessing a visitor passing a large stack of bills to one of the tenants just in front of my apartment as I was cleaning my windows. 

I began praying against the attacks as they wreaked of demonic influence but the more I prayed the worse it seemed to get. I began having distressing dreams - two, of which were demonic. In one of them a demon with red eyes cloaked in black actually flipped my coffee table toward me as I slept on the couch in front of it. I had been sharing a popular song, “Come to the Table”, by Sidewalk Prophets, on several secular artist’s Facebook pages, one of which was overtly satanic in their image. 

Touching upon the third time I began seeing these repeating number patterns, yet again, but in greater measure — @ 11 specific patterns that became so distracting to ignore: 111; 1111; 222; 333; 444; 555; 711; 714; 747; 911; and 10:10. I then discovered several Christian websites and YouTube ministries that encouraged these as a way God was speaking to people. I was cautious and so first decided to simply look up Bible verses when seeing them, or Strong’s Concordance. I was seeing “5:55” just as one example daily more than some of the others — sometimes twice and found that some of these ministries that I later found actually referred to them as “prophetic numbers” which sent me into even more deception. As I kept seeing “555” I learned that 5 represents strength or God’s grace, and I clung to this until I was left having to accept that it was all a deception to further toy with me and destroy me. 

I could feel there was something physically with me but by this time had come to believe that it was likely holy angels helping to guide me when I’d pray for discernment in how to proceed with giving money or with making purchases, along with other things. I once read Psalm 23 during this time while I was looking at what had become a favorite illustration of Jesus standing over/behind a female warrior on her knees as He poured oil onto her head and physically felt the sensation of oil being drizzled on the crown of my head. This happened twice. 

I experienced something I’m not even sure was a dream where I was sleeping on my side and awoke to feeling and two arms suddenly reaching across my body attempting to pull me down with it. 

I was beat up in every way spiritually, mentally, and emotionally last year — all while additionally following one woman, in particular, who seems to have a beautiful relationship with the Lord who is also in deliverance ministry. I began praying a lengthy prayer each morning to Holy Spirit as I was trusting that He was with me after she put out at least one video claiming that if anyone had found their way to hearing her in this video that it was by the leading of the Holy Spirit and that this meant that you were a child of God whether you knew it yet, or not. After my psychosis that left me terrified, untethered, deeply confused and ashamed this meant everything to me. As I began to trust her and the messages that were spoken through her from heavenly Father to her viewers — God’s children — I felt so much love and joy. This began in January of 2024, although I had already begun to listen to her deliverance videos off & on for the previous couple of years.

But by the fall of last year, even after talking for hours combined with both the pastor, an elder, another elder’s wife and being assured by others through other people that I was saved… I knew in my heart that something was just so very wrong. I had no internal intimacy with Jesus/Holy Spirit/Abba Father, as I had come to refer to Him. I wasn’t experiencing, nor showing evidence of, a personal relationship. I felt more and more like a fraud and that I was bringing shame to Jesus’ Name by continuing to claim and identify with being a Christian. So as a result I made the most viscerally and profoundly painful decision to stop everything — all the things I had implemented and come to treasure for some time that I had been trusting in were feeding and growing my faith and relationship with God. I had verses constantly coming to mind along with song lyrics for a few weeks until they mostly stopped.

It was beyond the most terrifying experience and it landed me in my bed since then. I don’t even begin to know how to describe it apart from that it feels like I tapped into the spiritual realm beginning in 2020 and am increasingly more sensitive to it ever since — but not in a good way. My days are dark, empty, alienating, and fearful. I don’t know how to live without God in my life — without the hope that believing and trusting in Him that helped me to carry on despite over 35 years of increasingly crippling anxiety in its various forms along with often debilitating depression that served to sabotage so many opportunities in my life and left me so close to defeated many times already before I’d begin, yet, again. 

I  always wanted, and believed, that one day I’d have a powerful testimony to share with others of how God had healed and delivered me. I learned to want nothing more than to bring glory to Jesus’ Name; to further His kingdom; and prayed daily for His will to be done both in, and through, my life. 

I don’t understand how I ended up here, or even why. I spent so many hours exploring every avenue —- listening to and reading breakdowns of often scary passages of Scripture, among other teachings, about proof of salvation and of repentance. 

*My bible reading slowly began to condemn me more and more, I should also add. But I continued to pray for my spiritual eyes and ears to be opened as well as for God to please help me to be obedient where I was failing. I also was prayed over — both over the phone; through email; and in person. I had hands laid on me my church members at more than one church — both times was anointed with oil.

I also continue to see daily repeating number patterns including a few that coincide with well known verses. It is a way to further torment by mocking John 3:16, 17 and both mocking and confirming the whole of John 10:10, among others.

Something that is still beyond painful and confusing is why God would allow all of this? I had been praying specifically for discernment and wisdom and yet it seemed to lead me further into being attacked and deceived. What was the point of all of the demonic attacks and deception in the very midst of my daily seeking God and turning all my focus to pursuing righteousness and intimacy with God — to suddenly become passionate about reading and studying my Bible and becoming aware that we were in the last hours before Jesus Christ returns. Why would God allow me to be so deceived and then leave me completely abandoned, rejected, and feeling worthless and more unloved than ever? 

I also don’t understand why He allowed this aforementioned woman to tell me that she sat with the Lord on my behalf and that as she did she saw that I was alone and felt alone but as the Spirit fell upon her she felt the Lord’s immense love for me. She then said that she heard Him speak the words, “This is my daughter” as she saw Jesus with me as He held me close. 

By this time it had already been months and I had already fallen back into watching secular entertainment which I had eventually stopped altogether by mid to late 2023, I believe. But I was left with nothing — completely untethered and utterly hopeless. I needed something to distract from the anguish, despair, and crippling fear that now consumed me after having believed I was significantly delivered previous to this. I also fell into other sins that I had repented of which I’ve tried to not return to again.

Then randomly, just a few weeks ago, I had two distinct dreams that were spiritual in nature and that inspired a little hope. Around the same time I had the spontaneous thought surface “consecrate a fast”. This was not even language I used, just like the other time I was so certain that it must be God speaking to me. The following morning I opened my Facebook and what displayed was a post I had shared to my timeline exactly one year prior on “How to know when God is calling you to fast”. I was almost convinced that this had to be from God. Yet, I was still skeptical due to all of the previous deception. So I asked God that if it was Him to please give me instruction on how to spend the time as I has already come to fear reading His word — feeling condemned — by this time and as my previous fasting only seemed to serve me being opened up to demonic deception spiritually. The thought to fast for three days crossed my mind and after about a week I decided I would commit to it. I prayed for God’s grace and for Him to please meet me in the midst as I prayed and as I was trusting He would guide me to where I should read from. But after a day and a half into my fast of nothing but emptiness and quiet — just no direction or sensing of His being present I gave up. 

It was just another crushing experience that left me further devastated; feeling confusion; and now resentment and bitterness.

I am beyond shattered and feel violated in so many ways. 

I know that God is Good — and that He is equally loving, Holy, and Just and that the problem ultimately lies with me. 

I don’t want any of what I shared to turn anyone away from God while at the same time I’m left so broken and feeling like I don’t matter and was a mistake. 

To believe that Jesus loves me to being left in this state? I hardly recognize myself anymore and feel trapped.",1,1754500474.0,TrueChristian,2,1.0,False

However, I could see the girl looking at me multiple times when this was happening as they were walking down the escalators too. As we got down, she asked him to leave her alone, which he did at that point of time. I’m cursing myself now for doing this but ik it was the right thing to do, so I went and asked her if she was okay and whether she knew the guy, she told me yes she’s okay and that the guy was her boyfriend. He looked quite older, but I ignored that and left her wishing her well upon discovering this. 

Just as I was leaving, the guy emerged from behind me and starts asking me ki what’s my problem, why am I interfering in a personal matter, whether I’m the police and started getting angry on me and shouting extremely loudly when I talked back and was being reasonable and explaining the situation that I left her as soon as I knew he was the bf. 5 minutes passed and the guards were there, and he’s explaining to guards how I am interfering in their matter when all I was tryna do is explain my situation here. He seemed to be getting extremely insecure and angry when I confronted him, and started abusing me verbally and was trying to get me tilted so it could turn physical, however I did not give him what he wanted. The guards came in the middle, the girl started apologizing to me on his behalf( I could see the fear in her eyes which told me, this fight is only gonna make her life more difficult than it already is), so I left it there. I said nikal bey and left the scene as I was a lil scared or it’s just the response one usually has before he knows he’s getting into a fight (blood rush), the guards were pushing him back as they could clearly see who the problem was.

Just as I was walking back, I turned around to see what was up and this dude was trying to come back and fight me, but I just turned my head and kept walking as I had some confidence in my strength lol, but he never came. I got my coffee and talked to the guards and they said he had to be kicked out. I seriously am worried about the girl but I don’t know the full story and judging by his temper, I don’t think she’s safe. I wish I had slipped her my number or called the police but I couldn’t in that moment. I only knew I had to leave or it was gonna get physical and I’m just a student with hopefully a great career ahead of me, which I don’t wanna fuck up over some bipolar idiotic and abusive man.

In a couple of weeks, I’m heading off to college and am gonna be rooming with my cousin, and recently, we’ve been coming up with various business ideas to run from our dorm lol. Because we both like coffee, we initially thought an espresso business might be a good idea since I recently got a cheap machine. Though, it’s loud and can really only make one at a time, and my machine is quite annoying. So scratch that. 

However, I was thinking about cold brew. More specifically, how much I personally like it, and how cheap, and how easy it is to make at home. After doing the math I found that a good strong cold brew costs about 60 cents a cup to make. Plus it can just sit in the fridge!! So essentially, I was thinking that this might be the perfect drink to sell from a dorm. 

The coffee shops around campus, while nice, are quite overpriced. And with many students likely wanting coffee every morning but also being broke, I’d be happy to sell them at 2-3 dollars a cup. (I don’t have to make a huge profit, I just wanna dip my toes into the business world).

Am I being overly ambitious or thinking too wishfully? Let me know. I want to SPECIALIZE into cold brew, and not really go into hot coffee as much. I think doing so would be more efficient than expanding my horizons too early on. We’d sell smooth cold brew, with cream and sugar should someone want it, and really not much more- at least for the time being.

What do you all think? Do all business majors think they’ve got a good idea until they put it into practice? This is all speculation for now. What experiences do you have? Any advice you can give me? Thanks.",1,1754500244.0,Business_Ideas,2,1.0,False

To honour the day, here's my lyrical interpretation and review of A Thousand Suns : A concept record which captures the horrors of nuclear warfare.","It's my birthday as well. It's quite coincidental that my birthday happens to be one of the most important days in the history of the world. 



Linkin Park has become my 2025 summer anthem. I listen to this band when I'm pissed, when I'm feeling extremely down and when I'm happy. It's my comfort band. It's only fitting that I make a post about my favourite band today.




I think it's quite fair to celebrate my birthday by discussing this beautiful album which addresses the impact of one horrific event that took place on my birthday, exactly 63 years before I came to this world.



This post is going to be extremely long since it's a deep breakdown of the album. If it's not your thing, you're free to ignore it. If you like to read stuffs like this and have some free time, then probably grab a warm cup of coffee and enjoy your day with some Linkin Park. 



**A Thousand Suns** is based on a very loose concept. The main concept of the album is nuclear warfare. But the album is also a narrative about relationships, break-ups and the loss of loved ones. It's totally open to interpretation.

  
* #**My Lyrical Interpretation of A Thousand Suns as a cohesive story**

[The first ever atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima.](https://preview.redd.it/yzjkpka6bfhf1.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=026ce489df1f5dea1c044ba9bd9b5f89d3f7ca62)

 
* #**Stage I :  The Immediate Aftermath of the Atomic Bombings and Initial Regret**

**1. The Requiem :** The opening track immediately sets the tone of the record. It creates a haunting atmosphere within a few seconds. The track serves a dirge for all the victims of the infamous atomic bomb detonation. It's the final requiem in their remembrance. 



The missiles have already been dropped. The victims are helplessly dying in the fire. The robotic, inhuman voice is an indication of nuclear weapons snatching away the singular essence of humanity from their soul. Those voices are merely the final shriek of help echoing from their throats. They have lost the ability to speak. Lying in their deathbeds, they're blaming themselves and their ancestors for something they're not responsible for. 



Their final moments are illuminated by smoke and hellfire. White bones are showing through their burnt skins, their prayers have failed. God is sleeping peacefully in heaven. Mankind is destroying its own creation. The slow, electronic voice in the track is a defeated, inhuman shriek echoing from the broken souls of the victims. Every sense of humanity has been wiped from their warped existence. The world is burning endlessly.



**2. The Radiance :** The end is complete. Americans laughed in victory. Japanese people cried while slowly lying down on their thorny deathbed. The rest of the world watched in silence. And it all started with one secret project in the middle of a hot, secluded desert. **The Manhattan Project**. One ambitious initiative, led by J. Robert Oppenheimer, later known as ""the father of atomic bomb"". 



The whole speech by Oppenheimer is like a broken man speaking at his own funeral. One final apology. He died two years after this speech. 





**The Manhattan Project** turned out to be successful. Oppenheimer succeeded in his invention. The trajectory of the world was changed forever. But at what cost ? The whole world changed for the worse and Oppenheimer was the backbone of the whole thing. He transmorgified into death himself. Oppenheimer became the antagonist of his own odyssey. Did he ever have a peaceful night's sleep after knowing his brainchild snatched away countless innocent lives ? He had the blood of millions of people in his hands. What initially was believed to be an ecstatic, scientific revolution, turned out to be a visceral nightmare. The world transformed into an unapologetic, barbarous slaughterhouse. 




[A war-devastated Japan after the atomic explosion.](https://preview.redd.it/7nvzi1sfcfhf1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28c6dc47fb7c0ce88d4316acf4274c37ad175451)

  
* #**Stage II : Slowly Re-building Everything from the Scratch**


**3. Burning in the Skies :** Humanity is in crumbles. The atomic bombs have incinerated a major fraction of the population from our world. Now it's time to build a newer, better society from the shambles. An old, worm-infested tree has finally fallen down; it's time to plant a tiny, green sapling in the parched soil.





**""I used the deadwood to make the fire rise**

**The blood of innocence burning in the skies""**




One half of the population is already wiped away by the nukes. The other half of the society is craving a little bit of warmth in the damp, isolated atmosphere. But there's nothing but smoldering wreckage left behind. So they pick up a deadwood and try to create a spark of fire. It's a metaphor about re-awakening the mighty heart of the society from a morose lumber. A monstrous catastrophe has just ended. The soul of their civilization is still asleep. They're trying to rejuvenate the gloomy spirit of the society. The sky is splattered with the blood of countless innocent people. The whole world has taken a vicious bloodbath. 





**""I filled my cup with the rising of the sea**

**And poured it out in an ocean of debris""**





These lyrics are metaphorical as well. We are all aware that water is and always has been the true foundation of life. The rest of the society is filling their cups with sea-water and pouring it in the wreckage. It's a metaphorical way of expressing that humanity is trying to create new lives amidst the heaps of debris. It's like pouring water in the wreckage will give birth to a newer generation of human beings and help forge a stronger, more resilient society. Mankind will rise from the ruins of an uproarious mayhem like a phoenix.





**""Oh, I'm swimming in the smoke**

**Of bridges, I have burned**

**So don't apologize**

**I'm losing what I don't deserve**

**What I don't deserve""**



These lyrics are poignant and prophetic. Mankind is aware that they brought this pandemonium upon themselves. They deserve to lose everything in the world. They're paying for their mistakes and a slight acknowledgement is not enough to make the pain go away now. The suffering will only continue to grow stronger and they'll eventually lose their way in the smoke created by their own kind. 

**""We held our breath when the clouds began to form**

**But you were lost in the beating of the storm**

**And in the end we were made to be apart**

**In separate chambers of the human heart""**

This part of the lyrics describe the atmosphere right after the bombing. Mushroom clouds are forming in the air. These lyrics are about the society being torn apart by the destructive power of the nukes. One half of the society got lost in the storm of hellfire forever. Countless people lost their loved ones in the catastrophe. We probably don't know how many people got separated from their significant others. Many people lost their parents and children. All because of one giant mistake of an action and we're still continuing to pay the price.



This song is about humanity coming to terms with their past mistakes and trying to rebuild everything from the ground. It's a track about the destruction of a society and the slow, painful but necessary rise of another one.





This track sets the mood for the rest of the record. The track is accompanied by tasty, soulful, minimalistic electronic beats and pristine production. The song only gains complete fulfillment by a gorgeous guitar solo in the bridge. Mike and Chester's voices perfectly harmonize throughout the track to create a sombre yet bittersweet atmosphere.


**4. Empty Spaces :** A perfect interlude between two tracks. It has different sounds of explosion and gunshots. It continues the theme of nuclear warfare destroying humanity. We can hear a stereotypical military command in this track in Spanish language. Brad Delson provided those vocals. It translates to **""All the platoons, pay attention right now.""** It highlights the military takeover during the second world war. 


* #**A Musical Statement**


https://preview.redd.it/vfr9eh27dfhf1.jpg?width=728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d771423b46bf23343dfb56356d4be9bdf687cee




**5. When They Come For Me :** This track is the only one in the album that's not a part of the concept. This is a standalone track and works as a pretty deliberate **""fuck you""** to all the music critics who gave Linkin Park so much slack for changing their traditional nu-metal sound. This is the music equivalent of a casual, careless middle finger. 

Mike states in the very first line of the track that he and the rest of the band do not work in a repetitive pattern and it'll be hopeless for anyone to try to follow them. He is tired of being seen as a role model to everyone. The band is just doing whatever they want and whether you like it or not, they'll continue to do it. Mike clearly states that he is not **""the same person telling you to forfeit the game""**. The person who wrote **Points of Authority** has changed and matured past that state; this is the beginning of a musical new era for both Mike and the band. The change in their sound is perhaps the most abundantly clear indication of their maturity as individual human beings. 

**""Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse**

**Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works**

**Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first""**

I love the wordplay in these lyrics. Linkin Park revolutionized the nu-metal scene with their debut record **Hybrid Theory**. It became a trademark sound of the 2000's. Everyone got a taste of Linkin Park's ""theory"" and they only continued to get dissatisfied with everything the band did afterwards. All they wanted was just **""Hybrid Theory 2.0""** and didn't accept the band's musical progress. That's specifically why Mike states that **""a blueprint is a gift and a curse""** because once everyone got a little taste of their sound, it became nearly impossible to satisfy everyone with a follow-up. Everybody wanted their next record to be exactly like the first one and even Meteora wasn't enough to satisfy some fans. Then Minutes to Midnight came out and it permanently divided the fanbase.

Mike says that the band will not dance to other people's opinions like a group of puppets no matter how funky the beat is. He challenges all the critics to stop talking trash for once and try to catch up with the band's success. 

Mike pays homage to a lot of his rap and hip-hop influences in this track. He says that he's nothing but a student of the game created by legends like The Notorious B.I.G. and Lauryn Hill. He not only harshly criticizes the haters but also humbly pays due respect to his musical idols. 

He states that he is awfully underrated. A lot of the so-called rappers in the nu-metal era were just spitting rap verses because it was cool at the time and didn't have any proper knowledge of the hip-hop subculture. Mike grew up listening to different rap artists and he was deeply submerged in the cultural phenomenon that is hip-hop ever since his childhood. He's here to make a statement that he's not a guy who is just rapping because of their music label's pressure like many others at that time, he is a proper rapper who knows his game better than anyone in the nu-metal scene. This whole track is Mike Shinoda's musical statement after years of criticism and hatred pointed towards him and his band.


* #**Stage III : A Little Glimmer of Hope in a Hopeless World**


**6. Robot Boy :** This track marks the return to the conceptual story once again. It continues the story to a further degree. It tells the story of an emotionless state of the world right after the second world war coming to an end with atomic explosions. 



A robot is incapable of showing any emotions. This song tells the story of a humanity who's lost in its own tales of destruction. Robot Boy has come to a stage where he doesn't have any human-like feelings or emotions. His mind has turned into an unsympathetic and fragile mess. Humanity has been hurt by countless wars and bloodshed for so long that Robot Boy thinks he has got nothing to lose at this point. People are torn about fighting for humanity's sake, because they're afraid no one will accompany them to the battlefield.





Compassion is nothing but a flaw in this world. Robot Boy truly believes that he's hurt in a way that no one will ever understand. He thinks that the current state of the world has kept him from releasing his emotional burden. He can't free himself from worries or responsibilities  because the world is stuck in a hopeless loop. The weight of the world means everything humanity ever did wrong and everyone humanity deceived. Humanity will have to compensate for their mistakes soon in the future. Justice will eventually return in the future and maybe the world will not be such a cruel place. This gives Robot Boy a little hope and re-energizes him to move forward in life and not get stuck in an emotionless state.





Now who is **Robot Boy** ? 


It's not a single person.


It's all those people who cared about the well-being of this world when politicians loaded their hearts with the seed of corruption and filled their houses with stolen money. It's all those people who gave a fuck about the world when it was at its lowest state. It's all those people who fought for justice instead of helplessly preaching like most blood-sucking politicians. 


There's a Robot Boy deep inside every single one of us. We just need to embrace it sometimes.



The song ends on a highly hopeful and energetic note. It's a relief from the dark, mournful atmosphere of **Burning in the Skies** and a lush, positive thematic commentary on negative subjects like hopelessness and injustice.


This is one of the most layered vocal recordings in Linkin Park's discography. There are well over ten vocal recordings merging with each other in this track. Possibly one of the most experimental tracks on the entire record. Mike and Chester's voices perfectly blend with each other throughout the song. The song features a gorgeous synth solo and brilliant vocal ad-libs from Chester.




[A picture of Jornada Del Muerto during the Manhattan Project.](https://preview.redd.it/p6zflj9odfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c86e52e463da86ebee6155146c1d419967adf39)


**7. Jornada Del Muerto :** Another interlude. Even a brief interlude like this contributes so much to the story of the album. Jornada Del Muerto is a desert region in New Mexico, approximately 40 miles away from the Trinity nuclear test site, where the first atomic bomb was detonated under the supervision of Oppenheimer. 

The phrase **""Mochiagete, tokihanashite""** is repeated continuously throughout the interlude. It means **""lift me up, let me go""**. It's like a spiritual callout to be set free from this cruel, nightmarish world. The phrase being spoken in Japanese is also an important highlight. Japanese people were and still are the only people to suffer the devastation of a nuclear attack. Both the verse and the title of the interlude strongly contribute to the thematic storytelling of the record.


* #**Stage IV : Coping with the Loss of the Loved Ones**

https://preview.redd.it/9166j4d1efhf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a8b6f4c8e3e2a11a0ae3e04abc94e4b0abbe794


**8. Waiting for the End :** This is a quintessential Linkin Park track from this era of the band. A masterpiece of a song with immaculate instrumentation. 





This track tells the story of a relationship and the pain of parting ways with your loved ones. Whether you interpret this song as the theme of losing your loved ones in the nuclear warfare or just a heart-wrenching tale of breaking things up with your longtime partner, they are both equally heartbreaking. The person in this song is trying to move on from a close person in his life. Many things were left unsaid between them, he's trying to forget the past. But it's impossible to let those memories go away.

**""Living at the mercy of the pain and the fear""** can be interpreted as spending your lives underneath the devilish shadow of war. **""Though the words sound steady, something empty's within them""** can be either interpreted as the government making false promises to the nation, or simply lying and making things messy in an already fragile relationship. The whole song has double meanings.

* #**Stage V : A Post-War Rebellion Against the Government**



**9. Blackout :** I interpret this song as a callout to the politicians and it's told from a victim's point of view during the aftermath of the second world war. Everyone is suffering from the repercussions of the second world war. High inflation, weak economy and a corrupted government. The victims are stuck in the thorn-bed created by the government, with nowhere to go. They clearly saw through the lies and deceptions of different politicians. They saw through their minds, the secrets they had been hiding deep inside their hearts. Their intentions are abundantly written in their diabolic faces; they're always waiting to snatch everything away from their own people. They can't get enough. They'll take, only take and not give back.


The chorus is the sufferer's deliberate callout to all those venomous politicians. He is telling them to keep all their sick, devilish habits and actions in check. He's telling those money-sucking monsters to **""push it back inside"".**


Those politicians always keep saying that it's not their fault and everyone trying to rebel against them is rather mistaken and delusional. He continues to cover one lie with another and suggests that **""it's not what it seems""**. He has no remorse for his actions. He often suffocates in the mess he's creating but he never seems to learn a lesson. Chester's final line in the second chorus **""Fuck it, are you listening?""** is an agonizing scream of the victims. Are the politicians even listening to all these complaints or are they rather acting deaf ?



Then the post-chorus is single-handedly carried by aggressive screams, crazy scratching and vocal remixes. And the bridge starts shortly after.





Bright colours are bursting in the air after the atomic explosion. These lyrics in the bridge are written from a futuristic perspective. Even though the horrors of war have long gone, the haunting memories of the past always pass through the dark sky at night. Future is here to collect all the things we've let go in the past. It's here to collect our sins and our unutilized possibilities. **It's future's lullaby to a horrific past.**



This is one of my favourite tracks on the record. It's different from anything Linkin Park has ever done. Chester aggressively freestyles throughout the track, while Mike sings the calm parts of the song. It's the polar opposite of the classic Linkin Park formula and still manages to achieve something sonically stunning.




[A Russian woman watches building burn sometime in 1942.](https://preview.redd.it/ud3ozgisefhf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60c9b95e352c8be301a4b2d5554bb0c1f1d6c2f9)


**10. Wretches and Kings :** This is yet another deeply political, rebellious commentary against the current state of the society. A group of people proclaim that they have the highest power in the world. They want to make everyone dance like little puppets. This track is basically calling out all those billionaires, self-proclaimed **""wretches and kings""** for all their bullshits and telling them to go fuck themselves. The everyday ball players of life have taken control and it's utter chaos. All those sophisticated, greedy money-suckers are trying to control everything while sitting in a cold room. They want everyone to get down when their people give out the order. They want everyone to get down on their knees and obey their words. But everything's gotta stop at some point. **""The people down low""** have started a direct rebellion, turning the gyre in a complete opposite direction.



This is a brilliant track with a layered, cold and funky beat. Brilliant juxtaposition of Mike's rap verses and Chester's aggressive singing style. Linkin Park sampled one of Mario Savio's famous speeches in this track to add a little more to that defiant theme of the track. 



[Martin Luther King Jr. delivering a protest speech.](https://preview.redd.it/lmg3vbgzefhf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa494ee727eaec4a91aee17b98826da7de64c5f3)


* #**Stage VI : The Slow Deterioration of Moral Values in a Post-War World**

**11. Wisdom, Justice, and love :** Linkin Park sampled one of Martin Luther King's speeches and added multiple layers of distortion for this interlude. The speech is about all three of those things mentioned in the title. But as the track progresses, Luther King's voice starts to change a little bit and by the time we get to the end of the track, it becomes completely robotic, unhinged and unrecognisable. It's a commentary on how all those speeches about spreading love and justice are irrelevant in today's world which is full of hatred. It's like those old speeches are slowly fading  into nothingness.


* #**Stage VII : A Final Attempt to Start Over**

https://preview.redd.it/l9f5lyrggfhf1.jpg?width=8160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e394b06e26f9ddca83fc489d99bcd32b4fd2260

  
**12. Iridescent :** This track is like a consolation to all the victims of the second world war. It's about letting go of all your sadness and grief. When the atomic bombs struck Japan, millions of innocent people died helplessly. They were standing right in front of devastation. There was a sudden burst of light in the sky. A light bright enough to blind the angels. An impact strong enough to shatter heaven into tiny stars. No one extended their hands to help those people. The ceremony of innocence was buried deep into the ground forever. 



But there's still hope. The sky is slowly turning blue again. Maybe it's time to get rid of all those years of frustration. Tears of melancholy. Years of depression and negligence. Free yourself of all those sturdy shackles. Maybe cry on my shoulder. Things can get better again.


* #**Stage VIII : Going Back in the Timeline**


**13. Fallout :** We've been a part of a ride so far. The first track is composed in the memorial of all the victims of the second world war. Then the album describes the dark state of the world right after witnessing the horrors unleashed by atomic bombs, rebuilding everything from the ground, slowly starting over a better society and letting go of all the pain and devastation caused by the warfare. 



The album has come full circle now. We're going back exactly where The Requiem began. The beginning of the end of the world. Mankind is in the brink of destruction. The robotic voice is like an indication that machinery and weapons mean a lot more to us than human emotions. Tears suddenly don't speak to our minds now. We are perhaps still human but our minds are transforming into one big chunk of a machine.



Then the robotic voice becomes human-like again in the end. The transition can only mean one thing. Weapons and machines didn't destroy mankind. Humanity destroyed itself. The weapons only carried away our instructions. We were and still are solely responsible for every bit of catastrophe happening all around the world.


* #**Stage IX : The Climax**


**14. The Catalyst :** The long-awaited climax of the record. We've gone back in the timeline with this track. The Requiem highlights the painful moments right after Japan was struck with the atomic bombs. The Catalyst tells the story of an agitated nation right before the atomic bombs dropped. 



People are sending prayers to God in vain. But they can't escape the apocalypse. Their fates have been sealed. It's a danger so imminent and huge that it's not quite possible to outrun it. It will come for you at any possible moment. The chorus has a vivid and vast array of imageries. It captures that unknown feeling of horror. Cosmic horror. No one knows what a nuclear weapon is like. It's like a Lovecraftian entity is coming to engulf all the future hopes and possibilities of the nation.



The oceans of our planet will soon evaporate because of heat created by the atomic bombs. And the planet will be left dead and lifeless because of a human-made disaster.





The lyrics from **The Requiem** come back in this track. But this time, it's not a robotic and inhuman shriek. It's very much human-like. Those people aren't ready to die yet. They have yet to explore different chapters of their lives. They are not ready to close that chapter. In **The Requiem**, those people were already burning in the fire and their screams were a mere echoing sound arousing from their souls; in The Catalyst, their agitated voices are their very last screams for help.

 

The Japanese chorus from **Jornada Del Muerto** also comes back in this track. **""Lift me up, let me go.""** A simple yet impossible request. They don't want to live in this battle of hellfire anymore. They want an escape. Even an omnipotent creature as strong as God lacks the ability to make all these pain go away.





Linkin Park's masterpiece. If there's any song that defines what Linkin Park does best both instrumentally and lyrically, this is the one. Gorgeous production, incredible electronic beat, great atmosphere and a combined effort by all the band members which result in this behemoth of a track.


* #**Stage X : Returning to the Original Timeline; the Emergence of a Peaceful World**

https://preview.redd.it/fjdngnyohfhf1.jpg?width=870&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ede9dab8e64f604d8e1ae0d75ffc2265ed95322


**15. The Messenger :** A peaceful ending. We're back to the timeline of Iridescent again. People have finally learnt to cope with all those years of pain, loss and betrayal. No matter how much of a devastating impact a war has, it will never be able to erase the spiritual feeling that is love. A perfect, feel-good ending to an incredible record.

* #**My Final Rating of the Album** 

10/10. **Hybrid Theory** was my gateway drug to the world of metal and that's why it's my favourite Linkin Park record. But when it comes to songwriting, production, instrumentation experimentation and an overall cohesive flow; there's nothing like **A Thousand Suns** in Linkin Park's discography. This album is Linkin Park's magnum opus and I'm prepared to die on that hill. This record is an incredible musical ride. 

* #**My Favourite Track**

**Iridescent**. It's not only my favourite track on this record, it's my favourite Linkin Park song of all time. A magical, ethereal journey. I'm a huge fan of Mike's singing voice. He has a very calm, soothing voice and his voice feels angelic in this track. It doesn't feel like Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park is singing, it feels like I'm hearing a lullaby from heaven. Then the way Mike's voice blends with Chester's voice in the second verse is just otherworldly. The whole song is an outer body experience for me.



I always imagine myself walking on the black beach of Iceland, looking at the gloomy horizon and this song ringing in my soul. This song is a perfect illumination of hope and empathy. Then the instruments kick in the final chorus and it becomes even more fantastic. A delightful, delicate track. It feels like a warm hug from a friend on a cold, rainy day.

I've had the Mara X V2 for a few months now and mostly love it! I haven't had any issues other than: after I pull my first shot and make an iced latte for my fiance, the next shot never comes out even remotely close to how the first one came out. It's almost like it gets clogged up or something. I was a barista for awhile and totally understand how to dial in beans, but this has been an issue for the last month or so. Let me explain a few things:

Equipment:

I use the Sculptor 078s for grinding, I've been using the same beans (medium roast from a local roaster), I use the same work flow for each shot (3x spray on beans, grind, WDT tool, distributor, spring loaded tamper, and then puck screen). I have it set on xmode Coffee and the temp switch set in the middle. I will often have an amazing first shot, make my fiance's drink (iced latte so I don't even steam the first time through) and then when I go to pull my shot for my flat white, the machine is almost choked up and acts as though my beans are too fine or something. I end up wasting so many beans because of this.

The machine comes set at 10 bar, and I set it to 9 bar myself. I don't have any pressure issues, but could this be a factor? My grinder has little to no beans left in it after grinding. I ""purge"" it as much as possible before grinding again. Could this be a temperature issue? Am I pulling a second shot too soon after the first?

The dentist and his assistant came back into the room and checked my mouth to make sure it was numb. Then they started digging out my teeth, or what was left of them anyway. I didn't feel a thing.

Hey Sprouters! Today’s quick tip is all about turning your morning brew into garden gold:

**Why coffee grounds?**

* **Nitrogen boost**: Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, which helps leafy growth.
* **Improved soil structure**: They help retain moisture while improving drainage.
* **Pest deterrent**: Slugs and snails tend to avoid coffee’s texture and acidity.

**How to use them:**

1. **Collect & dry** your used coffee grounds.
2. **Sprinkle lightly** around the base of acid-loving plants like tomatoes, azaleas, or blueberries.
3. **Work into soil** gently with a trowel or mix into your compost pile.
4. **Repeat weekly** but don’t overdo it; a thin layer is all you need!

**Your turn:**

* Have you tried coffee grounds in your garden?
* Which plants responded best?
* Any unexpected results or tips to share?

These tips might help:,"From my experience, many dental marketing agencies charge extremely high fees just to manage websites and run ads for growth purposes. While these costs might be manageable for DSO-backed dental start-ups, it seems like it can be tough for independent or family-owned dental practices(or even when rebranding an acquired office). 3 years after acquiring, rebranding and growing our patient base, here are some lessons that actually moved the needle for us:

\*\*NOTE that these strategies really vary based on the location, budget, patient profile, and the type of dental startups. If you are either a cosmetic, orthodontic, or pediatric dentist, these core strategies can align very well. \*\*

1. **Nail the basics first (your website matters):** Your website is your first impression. Keep it clean, minimal, and easy to navigate. For example, If your patient base is mostly families or older patients, show professional photos of the office and the doctor’s face front and center. Don’t overcomplicate it. Trust matters more than flashy effects.
2. **Keep your phones “open”:** Many dental startups underestimate the power of keeping their phones open during after-hours. Our office used a third-party hire to handle after-hours calls, but we just switched to an AI receptionist vendor that integrates with our PMS so patients can make real-time changes to their appointments without us being tied to the phone. Also, opening one Saturday a month (even just for by-appointment or routine procedure like cleaning visits) makes a huge difference in retention. The more support that patients have access to, the more they will come back.
3. **Always schedule the next visit before they leave:** Even after a patient finishes a treatment like Invisalign, we schedule their next check-up. Those short visits (whether it's 10–15 min) help patients feel cared for and keep the relationship alive. Dental service = people's service. As you start to grow, you can begin to limit this, but the initial stage is crucial.
4. **Small amenities go a long way:** Offering free coffee or a few bottles of water, and comfortable chairs in waiting areas can really set the tone. A relaxed environment makes patients feel like guests instead of numbers, and that extra comfort turns into referrals. All these should be on the website as well.",2,1754500014.0,dentalstartup,1,1.0,False

A few years ago, I fell down the rabbit hole of BCAAs, pre-workout, electrolyte drinks etc…. of all the things that I tried, the one that I feel like tasted the best, and maybe helped the best was the Hydration Sticks from Ghost. I dilute the powder into 40 ounces of water, and honestly anything less than this is just too sweet for me to drink. Well, the flavor (Sour patch kids Blue raspberry) has been discontinued. 

I tried working out with just my creatine mixed into my water, but it left me nauseated. There’s something about the salts, taurine, and maybe the sucralose (I normally hate this in my drinks) found in the ghost hydration that keeps my energy going, settles my stomach, and just generally helps me feel good. 

Outside of the gym, I’m a water or coffee drinker (usually black or a touch of cream). I don’t care for smoothies, juice, sodas. I even prefer tepid water to iced. But at the gym - I just need a bit more.

Now with his permission I've gone through his phone and found nothing more than platonic conversations, but a few days ago he left his phone on the counter overnight and when I got up to make coffee I snooped out of curiosity. (Yes he said I could look whenever I want) anyway, I found the last bit of a conversation between him and his ex talking about all of us and a friend to both of them going out for lunch. I say it's the last bit because the way the conversation started (or saved) is not a natural way to start a conversation. Now, what makes me so worried is he has mentioned her many times in a good light,  she lives quite literally three houses down, and I'm away for work a lot for days at a time. Should I be worried?

Well, that Cortado was... not good. It tasted pretty flat, even a bit stale. Nowhere near as good as what my Gaggia produces. And it's $4.50 on the menu.

I’ve always been desperate. 

I was born in an un-American city and moved to a brand new one when I was fourteen. My Slavic accent was harsh and gnawed at every word I said in English, and I shot up taller than most kids my age early before stopping shy of 5’10”. I was bullied and I was brooding, and the only high school friends I had were from playing Call of Duty on the Xbox on a TV stand that sank low into the floors of my Tato’s millhouse. The only close friend I had was my older sister, Kat, and the only times we hung out without my Tato were when she made me dye her hair with jet black box dye and cut it in our communal bathroom’s yellowed bathtub-shower fixture. 

“Lexy, can you stop shaking?” She’d complain very often. I was probably shaking, but also, she couldn’t sit still at all because she was scared that I would snip off her ear. 

“You asked me to do it!” 

“Yeah, I didn’t expect you to be such a pussy about it, though.” Calling a sixteen-year-old boy a pussy was a low blow, even for her. Kat had no room to speak when she kept wincing every time I cut an inch or two of hair above her skin. 

“Whatever. Just shut up. I’m almost done.” 

“Cut it better or I’m gonna tell Tato about your weed problem. And stop leaving hair close to the drain, God, you’re gonna clog it when you wash up.” She rubbed the back of her neck, sore from having to hunch backward while I cut her hair over a plastic bag we separated into two sheets and taped at the bottom of the bathtub. 

“You wanted to dye your hair, and you think that he’s gonna be mad at me for smoking weed sometimes?” 

“Alexei. I do well in school, but you don’t. He’ll be way angrier at you, to be honest. Shut up, and I’ll do your piercings next time he heads to class.” 

“Fine.”  

I reluctantly finished the haircut and cleaned up. She liked how I styled it enough to keep asking me to cut it, and she eventually pierced both my ears and found a friend who could do snakebites. Despite us being from a mainly Orthodox region of Ukraine, our Tato couldn't care less about whatever we did to our appearances, if we didn’t mess up the house. It also helped that he was younger: Kat was born when he was seventeen, and I was born when he was nineteen. He also probably couldn’t muster the effort to scream at us after coming home from class at eleven every other night to wake up at seven the next morning for work.

And that was it. Kat was two years older than me and followed our Tato’s advice to go to med school when she graduated, and she moved out of Chicago to go to UIllinois. Our Tato was hellbent on us pursuing some form of higher education after not finishing his practicing medical license in Simferopol before we left Crimea, and he took night classes after working at a corner store during the day. I just didn’t care much for school, unlike Kat; I got stoned, I learned English to speak it fluently and lose my accent, and I came home.  

But girls liked me enough to try and ask me for my phone number or to hang out after class, but I had some decrepit first-generation iPhone at home that my Tato and I shared. I would give our number to the few girls that pinned me for a foreign, always high, edgy dude, and then they would ignore me for days straight when my Tato texted them back with ‘is this for pharmacy clerk job?’  

From my friends who played video games and didn’t care that I got high immediately after school, I met my first girlfriend because she needed a date to prom for her senior year when I was a sophomore. Her name was Jen, she potently smelled of champagne vanilla body spray, and she had dark brown, long hair with bleached tips. She wore a starkly red dress that looked horrible next to my pale skin, bony, pin-straight frame, and sparrow-colored hair. Jen was my first kiss and my first time, and she also told me to stop talking during sex so that I didn’t say any disjointed English and Ukrainian blotted phrases. Not a horrible choice, because I still sounded like a strangled cat when I slipped into my native accent while rushing my words in English. 

The next two years were blurry. I can only remember the pockets of time that Kat would return home during Christmas to see us, and I could hear her crying at the kitchen table about school when I went upstairs to our room. Sometimes about her workload, her scholarships not taking care of her loans, or guys that hurt her. I always took her choosing not to share her problems with me in university as her not wanting to be close with me at all. To me, anyway, the issues she had with being approached by guys seemed like unnecessary complaints: hell, I would’ve given anything for attention and desire from anyone.  

Before I graduated from high school, our Tato was shot while he was stopping by the Ukrainian Village in the near west side of Chicago before heading to his night classes. It was obviously a targeted attack on the neighborhood following the Crimean annexation, but the suspect, caught on video footage outside the grocery our Tato was shot at, was only charged with manslaughter. Americans *really* do not like to press the terrorism charge on murders, especially when the victims are immigrants on a visa rather than U.S. citizens. 

A few of his coworkers and Kat took a train to the funeral procession in an Orthodox Church in rural, hayfield-surrounded Illinois, and some of our neighbors paid visits to me the following days. I didn’t cry, but I stared at blank walls after taking decorations off them to prepare the house to be moved out of, damp weight boring into my eye sockets for days after.

I ate Dollar Store brand Fruit Loops and drank canned espresso shots for meals a few weeks following until I realized I needed to pay off electrical and water bills. My Tato’s bank account was hemorrhaging money to pay for the house’s mortgage, and I was incompetent and unemployed after graduating. Kat told me to suck it up for as long as I could, and that she would give me some leftover money she had from interning at a lab near her school to sponsor me getting out of our childhood home. 

I searched for work over the summer once the house was sold with the help of my neighbor’s real estate agent, got a barely above minimum wage job as a waiter, and leased a studio apartment. All my high school friends were planning to enroll in university that fall, while I was living alone in all my 500 square feet in an apartment complex with Latin ornamented, bright green front doors. But I had a scalloped ceiling, and they didn’t, sooooo.  

With the extra money that I got from Tato’s estate, around a hundred or so dollars after my security deposit and having to split his bank account with Kat, I impulse adopted a cat from a rescue café in town. A sandy orange tabby with a chipped tooth and crooked tan nose that sidled up to my leg within minutes of me entering the building. I picked her up while sitting on a scratched-up armchair, waiting for coffee, and she flailed away from me before dangling her legs straight down like a ragdoll. That established our relationship. I signed her adoption papers the same day and named her Mitsy. 

Incompetent and bored, I turned nineteen and dragged myself to my job every day in a mechanical routine. Being told that I could be something great in the future when I was younger was a high expectation when I crawled back to my apartment after a shift and deflated on a full-size bed every night at nineteen with my cat hogging half of my pillow. Since I wasn’t attending college, I didn’t have the social life that I thought would appear after high school. I wanted the things that I lacked before, that I deserved in the dull fog of my routine.  

In the beginning of winter, just after most of the trees around my apartment turned into brindled, dead stick-like figures that would soon be covered in snow that wouldn’t melt until March, I created an account on a chatting app to try and make friends online—hopefully, close to Chicago, but I would’ve accepted any form of contact at that point. I presented as myself, really, except I attempted to emphasize every trait I knew made me somewhat different. Understanding, biting, alternative, anything that made me seem more of an interesting person who wasn’t constantly coping with a plateauing bank account and being a half-assed hermit.

After a few days joining base-level gaming chats and communities—all the games I liked were either free or bought way early into high school on the Xbox I took from my old house, so it made my gaming library really, really depressing-looking–I found a direct message in my inbox.  

Before opening it, I navigated to the user’s profile. The profile picture was a blurry, landscape shot in the woods, shot like an indie album cover with the texture of a crackling, glossy-printed photo. Maybe it was a screenshot of an actual album cover; I didn’t investigate further. I knew how to reverse image search, but I assumed that it was from an obscure band and didn’t want to sound stupid pulling information to talk about directly from the internet.

‘I really like *band name* too; my favorite song is their third most popular song, so that I sound like I know enough about them to be interesting and deep!’ I stopped doing that as soon as I told a customer at work that my favorite Sublime song was *Doin’ Time,* Jen listened to a cover of it in the car ride to prom, and I didn’t know enough of the actual discography to continue making conversation. 

The short biography attached just wrote that he was 26, lived in Aurora, and was interested in computer science and psychology. No idea if that meant he had a degree in either field or not, but I went along with the narrative that he did. The only connection we had was that we both were in a server for cataloguing and chatting about stolen versions of older Xbox and PlayStation games. I didn’t explicitly describe that I was from Illinois in the server or on my profile, but I was secretly really, really happy that he found my profile and was in the area. I opened the message.

**E (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:07 CST*** 

Hey,

I leaned slightly forward to read the screen, squinting at the text on my dim monitor. I rolled up the sleeves of my white dress shirt, feeling the tackiness of a drink that I spilled earlier on the underside of my wrist’s cuff before replying. I knew I didn’t have a lot of time before I needed to change and shower, and Mitsy had dinner already, so she was clawing up the side of my bedframe to lie down.

My actual reasoning for using the server as a chat forum rather than a resource for pirating was obvious. I was lonely as hell: you can read above again. So, I answered with a close-to-the-truth lie.

You wrote that you are in CST on your profile. 

You live near Chicago? 

 

The jump to discussing my location was a bit abrupt. Especially since he guessed correctly. But, of course, Chicago’s the most populous city in CST. It’s not like I lived in Springfield, and he immediately caught that I did. It was an easy guess.

Damn, you could have afforded to move to Chicago five years ago? How old are you? 

 

I forgot that I didn’t disclose my age on my profile. I honestly just assumed that people would think I was on the younger side based on the way I talked. I contemplated telling him—the itch to refuse was *heavily* reinforced by the hour-long assemblies about internet safety in high school and my Tato yelling at me for talking to strangers in Call of Duty lobbies when I was eleven. But I was an adult now, who cared what my age was if I wasn’t like, thirteen? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:15 CST***

**E (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:16 CST*** 

Huh. He must’ve been young if he was still finishing med school. 

Was he studying somewhere else? 

 

I felt an electric, scraping shiver pass through me at the fact that he was using the past tense to ask about my Tato. Probably, I’d forgotten some complicated grammar rules in English since graduation, but it was odd that he used ‘must’ve been’ instead of ‘must be.’ I shrugged it off. There was no way he knew that my Tato had passed. I also felt slightly weird that he didn’t end the conversation immediately after discovering the around seven-year gap between us. But I wanted to keep talking to him in the moment.

but i guess you’re right 

anyway, ttyl 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:20 CST*** 

TTYL??? 

What is this, Myspace? 

Goodnight. 

 

I snorted at his very dated comment before going to his profile to change his name displayed on my screen. I kept the autocapitalization of his name since he seemed bent on typing as grammatically correct as possible. I moved to shut off my computer again before I got another ping from the app. 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:21 CST*** 

\*Goodnight, Alexei. 

 

Smiling to myself at his response, I powered off my monitor before realizing that I was even excited that he corrected his dismissal with my name. Ew. Gross, me. I stood up from my desk and kicked my cloth laundry basket from my bathroom door to get inside the cubicle room. Mitsy immediately climbed inside the basket once it was pushed between the corner of the door and my apartment wall. 

While I was getting ready to shower, I hung the top of my dress shirt from the bathroom’s ventilation window after smudging in the drink spill on my shirt cuff with stain remover. I also jabbed myself on the back of one of my piercings while I was taking it out from the bottom of my lip, but just smeared the blood on the inside of my sink’s bowl. I didn’t clean it until the next morning because I really couldn’t care that much until my next shift. I just didn’t think to until I realized how gross it was, yikes. 

 

I didn’t get another reply on the app until a similar time the next night, but I’d changed and fed Mitsy before he sent anything. I also installed the app on my phone earlier during work, just in case I desperately needed the boost of getting a notification on shift to push me through the day. I turned on my monitor and waited for my PC to boot before opening the app again after checking my notifications on other websites. Mitsy leapt behind the monitor, and I had to shoo her away from chewing up wires behind my PC before she slid behind the desk to get out. Within ten minutes of me being online, I got a new ping. 

 

**Thursday, 12 December** 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:30 CST*** ***has sent you a friend request.*** 

 

I stopped and sat back from the computer. There was no actual way that it was Kat. I opened the account’s profile, noticing it had absolutely nothing written in the bio other than ‘hi’. The profile picture was one of the robot anime girls, the one with the blue hair, scrappily drawn on MS Paint but definitely stolen from another website. Damnit, it was probably Kat. 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:31 CST*** 

hi 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:31 CST*** 

? 

is this actually you katya 

how did you find me? 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:31 CST*** 

no 

I just like stealing people’s identities 

hit the Add Friends from Contacts button on your phone, you doof 

 

I groaned, pressing my fingertips deep enough over my closed eyes to feel some pushback before letting go and replying. She was still irritating. What did I expect? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:32 CST*** 

im not on mobile rn you DOOF 

also unlike you i dont like everyone having my contact info on this platform 

why are you using your full name here 

dont you remember what tato taught us about internet safety 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:32 CST*** 

fine 

I’ll change it :( 

\#incel 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:32 CST*** 

IM NOT AN INCEL!!! 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:33 CST*** 

you sound really defensive, RN 

you're the one hanging out on this app all the time 

I'm only on one server and I use it to find funny videos 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:33 CST*** 

u r so annoying 

u dont know my daily Gripes dont judge 

im only on here to download emulators 

 

I was already exhausted from having to advocate for myself to her, so the next message that appeared on my screen made me laugh hard. 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:34 CST*** 

there I changed it 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:34 CST*** 

EW 

YOURE SO GROSS 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:34 CST*** 

LOL 

wait, it won’t let me change back 

it has a cooldown 

NO I can’t do this I can’t live this way 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:35 CST*** 

LOSER 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:35 CST*** 

now our usernames are on level playing terrain 

I’m assuming you haven’t met anyone who knows Ukrainian slang LMAO 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:35 CST*** 

no 

just some weird ppl and one alright dude 

also id expect anyone who speaks ukrainian on here knows what it means bc they r not elderly and senile

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:36 CST*** 

ew 

I’m gonna close this now bc I’m bored 

I’m assuming that you respond here faster than texting 

 

I knew that texting was a lot easier for her when she was at her internship, but I didn’t need to talk to her on my phone if I wasn’t in an emergency. Besides, it would just help me after work to only use one app for messaging.  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:36 CST*** 

yeah wtv 

have fun with ur big important studies 

cure cancer tmrw 

 

I closed the conversation, almost immediately getting a notification after. 

 

**Thursday, 12 December** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:37 CST*** 

Are you online? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:41 CST*** 

yeah 

usually people are online when they have the online status but idk 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:41 CST*** 

Haha, funny. 

You should go make buddies in an improv troop.  

They’d love you. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:42 CST*** 

would love to do that  

except id be shamed for not getting into their school 

flogged in the university town square 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:42 CST*** 

You’re not in college? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:42 CST*** 

no 

my dad didnt invest much in an american college fund 

we were this thing called immigrants 

idrc about further education anyway 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:43 CST*** 

Why? 

You’re smart enough. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:43 CST*** 

money 

im also not that smart lol 

didnt get good grades in hs 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:43 CST*** 

It’s hilarious that you think that you’re not. 

But, yeah. Grades might be an issue. 

Money is also an issue. 

 

He stopped responding for a second, making me sit back in my seat. Maybe, he just wanted to end the conversation early; it was kind of a lost cause to convince me that I was even intelligent. I was a stoner in school and barely cared about anything other than speaking English fluently enough to not sound stupid and have no accent. Which sucked, because I couldn’t fall away naturally from my accent with my Tato and Kat at the house speaking in Ukrainian, so the bitter, Slavic tone remained.  

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:45 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:45 CST*** 

So. 

Do you work now? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:45 CST*** 

yeah 

waiter at a fancier restaurant 

get to wear a nice uniform and get paid subpar wages

get to be a businessman without doing business 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:45 CST*** 

Seems really lucrative and long-term. 

You want to stay in that field forever? 

Minimum wage? 

 

I snorted to myself at his question before sitting with my thoughts, biting at the inside of my cheek as I tried to explain the route to any career path in my mind. I didn’t think about the future much, I guess I assumed that I would bounce between occupations my entire life and build up a decent resume to, I don’t know, become an executive somewhere? Manage a store, at least? What even was my answer? I totally couldn’t pay for university; I could barely pay for my groceries and Mitsy’s supplies then. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:47 CST*** 

meehh 

sure 

i dont plan on doing much else 

my dream is to become a rock and pop out of reality 

or like phase into the pop art dimension like that one spongebob episode 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:47 CST*** 

Slow response that time. 

Are you even sure? 

 

I thought, ‘really, no.’  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:47 CST*** 

yeah 

i need money and can’t pay for further education since i cant take out loans

not a us citizen 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:48 CST*** 

Maybe something could help with that. 

In the future. 

 

I blinked a few times to see if I was reading his message right or if the text on my screen was warped from how low-quality my monitor was. *What?* 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:48 CST*** 

what are you, the divine oracle? 

the chance of me winning the lottery is very slim 

or finding a wealthy old person to marry 

old wealthy person? 

what comes first 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:49 CST*** 

Wealthy old person was correct, technically. 

Descriptors come first. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:49 CST*** 

ok english professor 

what do you even do for a living 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 20:49 CST*** 

Coding. 

Because I went to school and got a computer science degree. And a Master’s. 

 

His behavior made a lot more sense now that I knew he had a graduate degree. Of course, he wanted me to go to college; he basically was the spokesman of post-grad education. Nobody in America who *doesn’t* like education and has common sense goes to school for more than a bachelor’s degree. With that much money invested, you’re just cleaning the scum off the boots of the school’s dean with your tongue. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:50 CST*** 

woooahh 

you must be rolling in money rn 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:50 CST*** 

To you? Yeah. 

I made enough to pay off my loans for graduate school. 

Could probably pay for another round. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:51 CST*** 

the flexing wow 

wdym you can pay for another round??? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:51 CST*** 

I mean it seriously, Alexei. 

I could. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:51 CST*** 

you use my name like its a slur lol 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:51 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:52 CST***  

Whatever. 

So, you live in Chicago at nineteen and have stable enough income to, again, live in Chicago at nineteen. 

You really have nobody else to talk to? 

 

His change in demeanor seemed somewhat justified with how I nabbed at him for using my name, but really? It felt more awful than I wanted to admit how condescending his message was. Yeah, I didn’t in the moment after Kat went offline. My hands immediately moved to start typing back mindlessly while I could hear Mitsy rummaging under my bed, suddenly lively. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:52 CST*** 

no i dont 

kinda sucks that u bring it up lmfao 

twist the knife harder, oh grand tech wizard! 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:52 CST*** 

Didn’t mean to. 

Was just wondering why you would want to talk to me in your position. 

No girlfriend or anything? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:53 CST*** 

no 

last time i dated someone was in high school lol 

 

I stared at my message, slightly shocked that I had willingly brought down my ego. I didn’t even know why I decided to confess that I hadn’t been with anyone for that long. He seemed comfortable enough chatting with me to deserve an honest response. Right? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:53 CST*** 

That’s weird. 

You’re a good enough guy. 

Even if you’re a bit immature. 

But you’re still young, I’ll give you that. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:53 CST*** 

im rlly not great 

might be on ahole level 

not that attractive either 

face only a deadbeat mother could love 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:54 CST*** 

That’s a contradiction for sure. LMAO. 

Besides, there’s no evidence that you’re not alright looking. 

 

I paused, moving my hands off my keyboard and itching to immediately respond with ‘and you’ll never get any’ but knew that for some reason, I wanted him to know what I looked like. There was a rising pool of dread like bile in my stomach at the idea of him thinking I was ugly, but I replied. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:55 CST*** 

ill send a pic of myself if u share something about urself 

guy who wants to remain anonymous bc he pirates Tony Hawk Pro Skater after a day at his very serious coding job 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:55 CST*** 

Sure. 

Cool dig. 

I’m prepared for the worst. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:55 CST*** 

u commit to ur side of the deal first 

sharing is caring!!! 

 

I cringed a little–actually, more–at my message. Why was I so eager for him to respond? I mean, why did I let him know I was so eager to respond? Shaking it off, I stood up to grab my phone, discarded on the nightstand I assembled the weekend before. I remembered leaving the hammer I built it with on my kitchen counter and just, not moving it for a whole work week instead of finding the toolbox it was in. I was shocked that Mitsy hadn’t pushed it off the counter’s ledge yet when she was trying to scrape up the sides of my bedposts while I was pacing around, yowling at me when I got close to try to detach her claws from the wooden bedframe with my phone in my other hand.

 I unlocked my phone and thoughtlessly returned to my monitor setup while I searched for a decent selfie in my camera roll. I sent the photo to my computer and checked my direct messages again for anything new. 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:56 CST*** 

Fine. 

I’m 187 centimeters tall and weigh 86 kilograms.  

Had to convert. 

 

I barely read over the message before I attached the photo. I remember it being a selfie I used for a dating app a month before the conversation. Some well-lit photo facing my studio’s window that I took directly after work, when my shirt didn’t need much adjusting to be neat again.  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:57 CST*** 

\[Image\] 

holy shit u r tall lol 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:57 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:58 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue)*** ***at 20:58 CST*** 

You don’t have a girlfriend? 

You’re lying. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:58 CST*** 

not at all 

also y drop that kinda info 

not like im ur doctor and need those to make sure u r not Dying of malnutrition 

wait u wanted to flex on me wow 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 20:59 CST*** 

You’re going to ignore the picture you just sent? 

 

I laughed at his message. Yeah, of course I was ‘going to ignore it.’ I didn’t think I was that good-looking to warrant an awed response. I knew I was at least average; I worked out four days a week in the mornings and didn’t eat like a hog anymore. My hair sucked; it was always between dirty blond and ash brown growing up. And I compensated for having sandy pale skin with dark metals, so I looked grungier. I passed in looks. That’s it. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:59 CST*** 

yeah 

im alright looking 

??? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:00 CST*** 

Not to be weird, 

You are insanely attractive. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:00 CST*** 

thats bordering on weird, yeah 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:00 CST*** 

I mean it seriously. 

That’s you? 

Holy shit. 

 

Yeah, I didn’t believe what he was saying. At all. But it made me want to. Badly. I didn’t know why, but I needed somebody to tell me that after so long of not genuinely being called hot by people I knew. People I cared about enough to respect. Maybe he couldn’t tell that? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:01 CST*** 

yeah?? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:01 CST*** 

Damn. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:01 CST*** 

damn what 

u r leaving me with very vague short responses! 

har har 

  

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:01 CST*** 

Nothing. 

If you don’t want me to say anything weird. 

 

‘Anything weird?’ Oh. That meant something to me. I reached over my desk to shut off my monitor like it was a fight-or-flight response before stopping myself, letting my hand return to my keyboard. I didn’t even notice myself replying. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:02 CST*** 

no 

say it 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:02 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:02 CST*** 

I would see you right now if I could. 

 

A gut reaction flared up inside of me to deny. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:02 CST*** 

u cant mean that for sure 

but ill let it be 

haha 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***\*\*)\*\* ***at 21:03 CST*** 

You’re too insecure. 

Too insecure about your looks. 

Anyways, I need to sign off. 

 

His emphasis on how insecure I seemed was weirdly...soothing? It felt like somebody knew enough about me to tell me I deserved something. He was telling me that I should’ve been prouder of myself. And I needed that. It was warmth under my skin when nobody else would provide it. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:03 CST*** 

??? 

ok 

just say u gtg it feels like im talking to george washington if he had a Windows 10 virtual machine on his newtonian instruments 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 21:03 CST*** 

Fine. 

GTG, Alexei. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:04 CST*** 

its still weird all capitalized and in complete textbook grammar but ok 

goodnight, elijah 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 21:04 CST*** 

Oh, so we’re on goodnight terms now? 

You didn’t send me that yesterday. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:04 CST*** 

yeah bc u didnt call me hot yesterday 

idot 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 21:04 CST*** 

I didn’t know that yesterday. 

You type like a child and not a grown adult. 

It’s a little endearing. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:05 CST*** 

woohoo endearing! 

like the babies that look like wrinkly old men 

just like me

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 21:05 CST*** 

Shut up about your appearance before I keep talking about it. 

Goodnight, Alexei. 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue***) ***at 21:05 CST is offline.*** 

 

I inhaled deeply and closed the app within seconds of him going offline, blankly watching the monitor’s screen noise move on my desktop wallpaper. I had to remind myself to blink as my eyes dried up from being open for so long. The drone of Mitsy shuffling through my sheets when she finally jumped onto my bed became audible again in my mind. Did I read his messages right? He couldn’t have been. He probably didn’t like me. I stretched over the backrest of my desk chair, hearing my back crack, before standing up from my setup. 

I needed to not think for a while after that. I boiled water in the microwave to make tea and leaned my forehead against the tinted door for the full 90 seconds, like I wanted to get radiation poisoning. I sat down on my bed and opened my phone, watching Mitsy try and wiggle towards me from her giant, tangled duvet and sheet island.

1mja62x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mja62x/explore_the_best_nugget_ice_maker_antarctic_star/,Explore the Best Nugget Ice Maker Antarctic Star HZB-15NB Worth It,"The Antarctic Star HZB-15NB has been a reliable addition to my kitchen for months now. Being someone who’s forever running low on ice during family get-togethers, this countertop ice maker has truly been a game-changer. It’s compact yet mighty, offering features that go beyond its modest appearance. From its sleek stainless steel design to its impressive ice production capabilities, it has been a consistent performer in my daily routines. Of course, no product is perfect—there are things it excels at and also areas where it could do with some tweaks. Let’s dive deeper into its performance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its chic stainless steel exterior combined with its sleek black accents. Its dimensions are perfect for a countertop appliance, as it doesn’t take over my kitchen space. Measuring 8.66 x 11.3 x 12.68 inches, it fits snugly next to my coffee machine. The lightweight design, just shy of 22 pounds, makes it easy to move around whenever needed. Despite its compact build, it has a solid, premium feel that hints at durability. Beyond looks, the construction is practical, with a transparent lid that lets you monitor the ice-making process without opening it.

**Performance Under Daily Use**  
Using this ice maker has been surprisingly straightforward. Filling the 1.1-liter water tank, I can get up to 34 pounds of ice in a single day, which is more than enough for my family's daily needs and weekend parties. The real hero here is its speed—it quickly produces nugget ice in minutes, perfect for cooling our drinks without delay. Pressing a single button to operate the machine simplifies things further, and indicator lights keep me informed when water runs low or the ice basket is full. It feels like having a small butler in ice-related matters.

**Chewable Nugget Ice FTW**  
Not all ice is created equal, and the chewable nugget ice this machine delivers has been the highlight for my family. Unlike larger, rigid cubes that are a pain to chew, this ice has a satisfying crunch. It’s great for cooling drinks quickly, yet it doesn’t dilute their original flavors as fast it melts at an ideal pace. My whiskey-loving guests were particularly impressed when they noticed how the ice maintained the drink’s flavors. It adds an elevated touch to casual drinks or elaborate cocktails.

**User-Friendliness and Convenience**  
This ice maker has made my life a lot simpler. The low-noise operation ensures it doesn’t become a background distraction, even during late-night usage. The built-in ice scoop holder keeps the scoop within easy reach, solving the mystery of mismatched or misplaced ice scoops! The cleaning process is another area where the device shines. Just holding the “ICE/CLEAN” button for 5 seconds activates its self-cleaning mechanism. It efficiently runs a cleaning cycle and automatically turns off after 15 minutes, saving me the hassle of manual scrubbing.

**Small But Mighty**  
Despite its small footprint, it handles a rather large ice demand effortlessly. I use it for small home parties, outdoor hangouts, and even in our office kitchenette where space is especially tight. It doesn’t hog the countertop, which is a blessing if you’re juggling multiple appliances in a small kitchen. Portability adds yet another layer to its versatility, making it easy to store or relocate as needed.

**Favorable Features**  
- The self-cleaning function is a time-saver and keeps hygiene intact.  
- Its ability to produce chewable nugget ice stands out among generic cube designs.  
- Compact design allows it to blend seamlessly into any kitchen setup without hassles.  
- Minimal noise makes it well-suited for both homes and offices.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The water tank, although sufficient for daily use, might feel small for larger parties.  
- A slightly longer power cord would have made setup more flexible in terms of placement.  
- It lacks a direct water line connection, meaning you have to manually refill the reservoir.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it with other countertop ice makers, such as the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, highlights some notable differences. While the Opal version often boasts a higher capacity and direct water line hookup, it’s also bulkier and significantly pricier. For people like me who value compact design and affordability over bells and whistles, the Antarctic Star HZB-15NB certainly feels like the more practical choice. On the flip side, competitors like the Frigidaire EFIC235 also deliver nugget ice but lack the stainless steel chicness of this model. Compared to these options, functionality and aesthetics give this product an edge.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
While countertop ice makers can sometimes feel like a high-end indulgence, this one offers excellent value for its price. The ease of use, durability, and thoughtful design justify its cost. On top of that, it bridges the gap between premium and budget-friendly without sacrificing key features. If you’re someone who’s looking to elevate their entertaining game or simply loves iced drinks, this machine is worth considering.

1mja5zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/System76/comments/1mja5zp/leaning_towards_a_new_darter_pro/,Leaning towards a new darter pro.,"I am leaning towards buying a darter pro, today's current laptop choices suck and I'm ready to pull the trigger. I have a few questions.

1: Will we get a DARP12 within the next few years? I'd hope not as then it's apple all over again....

2: 14"" or 16"" At the end of the day we all know it's personal preference. I was wondering if the 16"" maybe had a better cooling system or if it's just a no brainer. This lsptop will travel a lot! College, cars, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. I don't mind carrying around a 16"" but I just gotta know.

3: Other OS support. I love Pop_OS! I was wondering how support would be for other distros like Debian and Arch. (I'm not a Windows fanboi)

4: What's the clevo argument I hear online? Surely it's nothing right? How are these system's optimized specifically for Pop_OS!? Any drivers I gotta worry about with other distros?

5: Educate me on coreboot.

I really look forward to a darter pro! Thanks!

1mja4lu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mja4lu,Freeze-dried rose buds that actually stay red — perfect for tea or pretty much anything 🌹🍵,"Rose bud tea has become one of those little rituals I actually look forward to. It’s caffeine-free, smells amazing, and has this soft floral taste that’s relaxing without being too perfumey.

What I love most is using [freeze-dried rose buds](https://www.naturalplusgreen.com/products/npg-dried-rose-buds-flower-herbal-tea-16-oz?_pos=1&_sid=bcb7ec3d9&_ss=r%3Fvariant%3D41062218006615&variant=41062218006615) — the color stays a deep red, so it looks just as good as it tastes. I usually brew a few buds in hot water and let it steep slowly. It's my go-to when I need something calming at night or just want to take a break from coffee and green tea.

It’s also great for when guests come over. Everyone always comments on how pretty it looks in the cup. Plus, it supposedly helps with digestion and stress — can’t complain about that.

Anyone else here drink rose tea regularly? Or mix it with other herbs?",1,1754499443.0,CookwithNPG,0,1.0,False
1mja4c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mja4c1/betrayed_under_the_full_moon_my_alpha_my_enemy/,"Betrayed Under the Full Moon: My Alpha, My Enemy Novel Reading Link","The moment the lab went up in flames, Lucien Draymore—Alpha of the Draymore Pack and my soon-to-be mate—didn’t even hesitate.  
  
  
He sprinted straight toward Selene Vale, his precious little Omega “niece,” who’d been standing near the perimeter. He threw himself over her, shielding her with his body from the blast without a second of doubt.  
  
  
When the smoke finally cleared, his first instinct was to scoop her up and rush to the pack’s medical center—never once looking back to see if I was even still breathing.  
  
  
Meanwhile, I was lying there on the scorched lab floor, blood soaking through my shredded clothes, watching the man I was supposed to bond with in thirty days carry another woman to safety like she was his whole damn world.  
  
  
That sweet little Omega he’d raised for eighteen years—just a distant relative the Draymore family took in out of pity, all soft eyes and sweeter lies—had carved out every inch of his heart.  
  
  
Once dismissed as a nobody, she wormed her way in with helpless smiles and well-timed tears.  
  
  
Lucien gave her everything. There wasn’t a single space left for me.  
  
  
It was my colleagues who dragged me to the medics—barely in time to save my life. Three days later, still hooked to IVs and running on heartbreak and painkillers, I picked up the phone and made the call.  
  
  
“Rhys? It’s me.” My voice cracked. “That research thing you kept pushing? I’ll do it. One month from now, five years off the grid, no contact with anyone? Whatever. I’m in.”  
  
  
My mentor, Rhys Varrick, had been trying to recruit me for months for some top-secret cross-territory project up in Moonveil territory.  
  
  
I’d always said no.  
  
  
One month from now was supposed to be my mating ceremony—the day I’d been dreaming about for years.  
  
  
But now?  
  
  
I’d rather disappear.  
  
  
After I was hospitalized, visitors came and went in steady streams.  
  
  
Friends and family all stopped by.  
  
  
But Lucien Draymore, my mate-to-be, only managed a single phone call:  
  
  
""Selene is crying her heart out, and I can't leave her side. Just take care of yourself. Look, I have to go—she's refusing to eat unless I feed her. What am I supposed to do?""  
  
  
How pathetic.  
  
  
Ten years together, and in his mind, my life wasn't even as important as his precious ""niece's"" meal...  
  
  
It hadn't always been this way. Lucien was the one who'd pursued me relentlessly from the start.  
  
  
When someone spread nasty rumors about me, he got into a fight defending my honor and nearly faced pack disciplinary action.  
  
  
I loved the shrimp dumplings from Wolftown's historic district, and he'd brave any weather to get them for me.  
  
  
My grades in Pack Strategy and Territory Management were terrible, constantly dragging down my ranking, so he'd stay up all night creating study guides, breaking down complex scenarios and explaining tactical formations.  
  
  
He was the one who'd followed me around shamelessly, confessing his feelings, swearing he wanted to be with me for life.  
  
  
And he was also the one who kept abandoning me for Selene's sake...  
  
  
The wounds on my body were still bleeding, each throb a painful reminder that it was long past time to give up on a mate who didn't love me.  
  
  
Fighting back tears, I deleted every trace of him from my Wolfgram account, then sent out cancellation notices to all our friends and family:  
  
  
【Mating ceremony in one month is CANCELED. Don't make the trip.】  
  
  
Twenty-five days later, I discharged myself and took a cab back to our pack house.  
  
  
The rose garden I'd planted outside the villa had been ripped out and replaced with lavender.  
  
  
Those flowers were Selene's favorite.  
  
  
The swing set was gone, replaced by an enormous cartoon sign: ""Selene and Uncle's Love Nest.""  
  
  
Below it, two cartoon figures were locked in a kiss.  
  
  
I didn't need to guess whose idea this was.  
  
  
This wasn't Selene's first stunt.  
  
  
But no matter how outrageous her behavior, Lucien always indulged her.  
  
  
I laughed bitterly to myself as I punched Selene's birthday into the digital lock and entered the house.  
  
  
Five days left before I'd leave with my research supervisor. I needed to pack.  
  
  
I headed straight upstairs, but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when I pushed open the bedroom door:  
  
  
Lucien lay there, bare-chested in nothing but sleep pants, his lip split and bleeding, fresh scratches raking across his chest.  
  
  
Selene was curled against him in a slip dress, her curves pressed tight against his body, wrapped around him like ivy.  
  
  
A pair of black lace panties lay discarded on the floor.  
  
  
I thought I'd steeled myself for anything.  
  
  
But seeing this scene, rage still surged through my veins like wildfire.  
  
  
This was supposed to be our mating house, our bedroom. How could they do this to me?  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""Kaia, you're back—why didn't you say anything? Look, nothing happened between me and Selene, okay? Don't overthink it.""  
  
  
Lucien jolted upright the moment he saw me, yanking on the nearest shirt as he stumbled out of bed.  
  
  
Selene stirred, blinking sleepily as she whined, ""I’ve always been scared of thunderstorms, like, ever since I was a kid. Uncle Lucien’s the only one who can help me fall asleep. Come on, Auntie—You're not seriously gonna make this into some big drama, are you?""  
  
  
Their shamelessness almost made me laugh.  
  
  
But I'd promised myself in that hospital bed: no more tears over Lucien Draymore. Not one.  
  
  
""Drama? Trust me, there's nothing dramatic here. Even you two could screw right in front of me and I wouldn't bat an eye.""  
  
  
I was about to leave with that.  
  
  
Lucien's hand shot out, fingers digging into my wrist with bruising force. ""We didn't do anything! How can you even say shit like that to her? She's my niece! Do you want to mess with her head forever? Go apologize. Right now.""  
  
  
I yanked free, ten years of frustration exploding out of me. ""It's always about Selene, isn't it? 'Selene won't eat,' 'Selene's upset'—I was in the hospital for nearly a month, Lucien. I almost died. Did you give a damn about me for even five minutes?""  
  
  
His anger flickered into something that looked almost like shame. ""Come on, it's not like I didn't want to see you. Selene was hurt after the explosion—someone had to take care of her. I couldn't just leave her.""  
  
  
Those words extinguished every last ember of hope in my chest, leaving only cold ashes.  
  
  
Every fight I'd stored up, every tear I'd been saving—gone.  
  
  
Why keep beating this dead horse? Lucien didn't love me anymore. That one sentence answered every question I'd ever had.  
  
  
""Lucien!"" Selene called from upstairs, her voice all sweet and needy.  
  
  
He shot me one last irritated look. ""Look, forget about tonight, but don't you dare talk to her like that again."" Then he was gone, rushing back to his precious niece.  
  
  
Not even a ""are you okay?"" Nothing.  
  
  
""Well, that's that,"" I whispered to the empty hallway, standing there until my legs went numb before finally dragging myself upstairs to pack.  
  
  
Documents, a few clothes—everything else went straight into trash bags. The last things were those sketches. Dozens of portraits Lucien had drawn when he was still trying to win me over.  
  
  
My art major friend had laughed about them once: ""These are terrible technically, but you can feel how crazy he was about you. I couldn't fake that kind of emotion if I tried.""  
  
  
Those sketches had made me believe he actually loved me. What a joke.  
  
  
I carried the whole box outside and struck a match.  
  
  
Of course Lucien showed up right then.  
  
  
""What the hell are you doing?"" He shoved me aside, not caring about the flames as he tried to salvage whatever he could. His voice was shaking.  
  
  
I should've told him the truth—that I was done, that we were over. Instead I heard myself say, ""They got bugs in them.""  
  
  
Lucien stared at the rescued sketches for maybe two seconds before tossing them back into the fire. ""Selene freaks out around bugs. I'll draw you new ones sometime.""  
  
  
""Don't bother.""  
  
  
There wouldn't be a sometime for us.  
  
  
The fire ate everything, leaving nothing but ash and the smell of burning paper. Just like us.  
  
  
【Five days left.】  
  
  
I posted the countdown on Wolfgram and holed up in the guest room farthest from our bedroom.  
  
  
Morning brought a flood of notifications. Friends commenting on my post, all excited about the upcoming mating ceremony.  
  
  
Lucien had even replied: 【Can't wait to see my beautiful mate walking toward me. Soon.】  
  
  
Lying bastard.  
  
  
I was running on empty, but he still wanted to play the devoted couple for social media. I didn't have the energy anymore.  
  
  
I ignored every notification and went downstairs for breakfast.  
  
  
Over coffee, Lucien asked casually, ""So we're still on for the bonding registration this afternoon, right?""  
  
  
Yeah, we were supposed to seal the mate bond this afternoon.  
  
  
But now, I couldn’t bring myself to want it anymore.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Before I could even say anything, Selene was already plastering herself against Lucien's side.  
  
  
""Uncle Lucien, I just remembered—there's this basketball game this afternoon I've been dying to see.""  
  
  
Lucien reached over and pinched her cheek. ""Why didn't you mention this earlier?""  
  
  
Selene pouted prettily. ""I just remembered, okay? It's not like I did it on purpose! If you're too busy to come with me, I guess I could go alone. I mean, getting hit on by hot guys isn't exactly a hardship—maybe I'll even meet my true mate there.""  
  
  
She started to get up like she was leaving.  
  
  
Lucien panicked, grabbing her hand and pulling her back into his arms. ""Hey, I never said I wouldn't go with you!""  
  
  
He looked at me with that familiar conflicted expression. ""Kaia, you see...""  
  
  
I sneered. ""Bonding registration requires both mates to be present. Is there some law that says you have to escort Selene to basketball games?""  
  
  
Lucien's face darkened instantly. ""She's just playful, that's all. She's been looking forward to this game forever. You really want her to miss out on something this important just because we need to do some paperwork?""  
  
  
""If you weren't planning to listen to me anyway, why bother asking?""  
  
  
""Fine. Whatever. It's not like I'm stopping you from going! We've already postponed the registration three times—what's one more? Selene comes first, right? Go ahead.""  
  
  
The old me would've fought tooth and nail over this. Now I couldn't even muster the energy to argue.  
  
  
Besides, I didn't want to register our bond anymore anyway.  
  
  
Seeing that I wasn't going to make a scene, Lucien's expression softened. ""Look, you're finally being reasonable about this. Don't worry—we still have three days until the ceremony. I promise I'll take you to register before then.""  
  
  
He threw me that casual promise and headed for the door with Selene in tow.  
  
  
She whined that she didn't want to walk.  
  
  
He laughingly called her a ""lazy little wolf"" and scooped her up in his arms.  
  
  
Selene giggled in his embrace, then turned back to flip me off with a taunting smile. ""Uncle's not coming home tonight—he's gonna party with me all night long. Don't you dare try to interrupt us, Auntie!""  
  
  
I was so fucking done with their shameless behavior.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone and recorded a quick video of Selene in Lucien's arms, adding it to the special folder I'd been building—full of photos and videos of their overly intimate moments.  
  
  
I packaged everything and sent it to our mating ceremony coordinator.  
  
  
【Hi, I'd like to change the photos and videos for the ceremony slideshow. Thanks.】  
  
  
Then I posted on Wolfgram: 【Four days left.】  
  
  
They loved putting on their little show in front of me. Time to help them out.  
  
  
Four more days, and everyone would get to witness their ""heartwarming family bond.""  
  
  
The next day, Lucien called.  
  
  
""I'm not coming home today or tomorrow either. This tournament runs three days, and Selene's having such a blast. I've watched her grow up—if I'm not there to protect her, someone might take advantage.""  
  
  
I gave him a noncommittal ""mm-hmm"" and hung up, then headed to his company to submit my resignation.  
  
  
On the way home, I updated Wolfgram: 【Three days left.】  
  
  
When the tournament ended, Lucien still didn't come home. Just another phone call.  
  
  
""I'm... I'm not coming back tonight either. Selene threw me this bachelor party—says it's my last chance to cut loose before I'm mated. I know we've got the rehearsal tomorrow and things are crazy, but this is her way of showing she cares...""  
  
  
Even Lucien seemed to realize how ridiculous this all was. For once, the man who could justify anything sounded genuinely sheepish.  
  
  
I could hear Selene complaining in the background: ""Uncle Lucien, just because you lost at truth or dare doesn't mean you had to kiss me hard enough to split my lip!""  
  
  
Lucien hung up immediately.  
  
  
I didn't say a word.  
  
  
I just called a disposal service to haul away everything—his clothes, toiletries, the lights I'd picked out, the furniture I'd chosen, every dish and decoration. If it had anything to do with me, it was gone.  
  
  
【Last day!】  
  
  
I stared at the empty shell of our former home and posted the update.  
  
  
After tomorrow, no matter how much I'd loved, hated, or resented them, I was done with both Lucien Draymore and Selene Vale forever.  
  
  
Lucien commented: 【Don't worry, babe. This party won't interfere with our ceremony. I'll be there tomorrow, ready to make you mine forever!】  
  
  
Whether he showed up or not didn't matter.  
  
  
I wasn't planning to be there.  
  
  
I didn't reply, just stared at the ceiling until dawn broke.  
  
  
On the day of our mate ceremony, while Lucien stood outside with his groomsmen, ready to claim me, I walked straight out the front door, suitcase in hand, and boarded the helicopter waiting on the lawn.  
  
  
Didn’t even look back.

2,2 kWp modules on southside only (more not possible)

I would like to use the produced energy primary for the TH but when it is not used, it would be nice, if the main house could use the storage energy too. Other way around it needs to be possible to use public energy in the Tinyhouse when there is no Solar power on storage or produced.

I used to manage with just one hot cup of tea in the morning and convince myself I was fine. But this season? By 9am my fingers are frozen, and by 3pm I’m craving anything warm like tea, coffee, hot water… anything.

So I finally bought myself a proper stainless steel vacuum flask, the kind that keeps drinks hot for hours. I used to think flasks were only for shags, churches, or mums with toddlers. But listen I don’t know why I waited this long. I fill it up with tea or hot lemon water in the morning and it stays hot till late afternoon. No microwaving, no reheating, no sad cold sips.

Now every time I pour myself a cup at work or even in traffic, I feel like I unlocked a soft life level I didn’t know I needed. One of my colleagues even said, “Umevaa na uko na chai ya thermos? You’re weather-proof now!” 😂

Sometimes it’s the small things that make the biggest difference. With all this cold, this flask is easily one of the best decisions I’ve made this year. I feel like a proper adult.",1,1754499196.0,KenyaCasual,0,1.0,False

That changed real quick after I had a minor skid near a wet zebra crossing. Wasn’t even speeding - but the fall scraped half the skin off my palms. Nothing major, but enough pain to teach me: even the shortest rides can mess you up. Since then, I never get on the bike without my armoured gloves.

I know most of us won’t even touch the bike without a helmet - but what’s the one piece of gear that you treat like non-negotiable? Is it the gloves, a proper jacket, ankle boots, reflective vest at night, or something less obvious like earplugs or a neck brace?

1mj9z5n,https://i.redd.it/66zx9fs6ifhf1.jpeg,Picked up a black Wii Balance Board for $8. Turns out a university was using it as a Bluetooth scale in a science project.,"Saw a listing for a cheap Wii Balance Board on a local second-hand site and arranged to pick it up in person. The seller gave me an address and said they'd meet me outside.

The address? A building belonging to the local Technical University.  
The person handing it over? A literal professor.

She told me they used the board during a research project as a **Bluetooth-enabled scale**, and that they never even connected it to a Wii. I’m guessing it weighed test subjects, coffee mugs, and maybe a few egos.

The board is in near-mint condition. No grime, no wear, just pure lab-grade balance.  
Also, it's the **black version**, which I think only came bundled with certain Wii Fit Plus packages — kind of a rare find i think.

So yeah, this thing has spent its life in a lab. And now it’s finally back where it belongs:

1mj9ye0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/1mj9ye0/back_from_the_hospital_i_guess_im_back_on_jorveza/,"Back from the hospital, I guess I'm back on Jorveza. For good this time.","Yesterday I had my second hospitalization since years, because a piece of meat (steak) got stuck and I could not swallow anything. Just blocked off my esophagus completely - well, my esophagus tightened around the piece to be more precise, of course. Even saliva got thrown up. At very consistent intervals.  I sat there in the emergency room, with a bucket with a bottom full of saliva. Good times. But I knew what it was, because I had in 2019 too. With a piece of chicken. Very tiny, they said. I was amazed again how much and how fast your mouth can produce saliva.

Last year, the specialist said there are two solutions: either find out what your triggers are (it takes weeks, if not months) or take medication.

I don't have the time or motivation to do the trigger research. It is interesting however, how chicken meat and cow meat were both the pieces that got stuck. But of course, it doesn't mean they are the triggers.

Between 2019 and now, some occasional difficulty at swallowing, maybe once every three weeks. But nothing that could not be saved with drinking some water. The thing is, you almost don't notice it anymore, if it becomes a frequent thing. Until yesterday... had to be completely sedated and they went inside to check it out again. Of course, the piece was already gone because if the sedation. A bit of an anti-climax, but I was freed.

It does induce some stress, EOE, even if I don't have a very severe case. I just can't grab a snack or eat something if I don't have water near me. I am a photographer, especially weddings. So you can understand how this can go very awkward very quick. I had a couple of times where I was too fast at grabbing something to bite when hungry - like a piece of dry bread on the table and it got stuck in my esophagus while there was nothing to drink yet. You start heating up, your face gets red, you can't say anything and hope nobody asks you something and just try to get to the toilet or any source of water.

I once was at a social gathering and I threw up the sip of coffee I was swallowing - random strong single hiccups are part my symptoms -  at a girl in front of me. Most people present didn't know I had EOE, including her, so that was a nice experience, you can imagine.

You just have to adapt, I guess. I could be worse, I often think. I do wonder what my triggers are. Nothing has stand out yet.

I took Jorveza for about half a year until April this year. I thought I was ""healed"" somehow, but clearly I was being naïve this EOE is here to stay, so I'm going to be taking it for the rest of my life. It's either one pill a day or a weekly injection in my waist with immune therapy, according to the specialist.

I am fortunate to live and work in a country where basic health care pays for the medicine - but only if basic treatment with stomach acid blockers fails, so not without conditions. It's about €350 apparently for a box. But I only need to pay €15.

It's comforting most people seem to praise Jorveza here on Reddit, so that helps.

But I wonder, is there any data on long term effects of using Jorveza? Any predictions? Things I need to look out for?",0,1754499057.0,EosinophilicE,2,0.5,False

1mj9xkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1mj9xkz/started_building_my_business_from_0_in_february/,Started building my business from 0 in February and now things are moving,"Hey, I'm Ismael. Let's start from ground zero. I had 10 years of experience working as a visual designer. From big brands to early-stage startups. The thing is, I had zero leads and zero connections.

Just a portfolio with past client work that wasn't under any NDA whatsoever and a dream.

Let's not forget that my first 2 months had zero revenue impact. Well, negative one with expenses. At that time a deep frustration with the way freelance design was supposed to work, sending cold emails, applying to gigs, hoping someone would “need a logo.” That never felt right. I wanted to work with people building something real. People who cared about how they showed up.

So instead of trying to sell, I started sharing. First on YouTube, breaking down why early startups often looked untrustworthy or unclear. Then on LinkedIn, where I posted almost every day about branding, strategy, mistakes I kept seeing, and the behind-the-scenes of working solo. Most recently, I launched a newsletter called ""*Busy Founders""*, where I send weekly thoughts that challenge how founders think about their product’s brand and presentation.

I didn’t have a “growth plan.” I just documented the work and stayed consistent. Slowly, it started to click.   
A note here: My first clients came from here (Reddit), where I audited startup websites.  
  
A couple founders reached out. Then a few more. My goal here is to work with people who care about their brand and their company. I’m not a designer who makes it pop or make it look like (insert your competitor name here). I don’t work with people who want a quick visual refresh. I work with founders who want to build something that lasts, and know design is part of that strategy.

With that in mind if any fellow designers are moving through the same path feel free to connect. Also, if you're that kind of founder that I've described we should connect. Coffee on you!

Thanks for reading this,  
Ismael

1mj9wok,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mj9wok/sodmanblue_part_1/,Sodmanblue [Part 1],"I’ve always been desperate. 



I was born in an un-American city and moved to a brand new one when I was fourteen. My Slavic accent was harsh and gnawed at every word I said in English, and I shot up taller than most kids my age early before stopping shy of 5’10”. I was bullied and I was brooding, and the only high school friends I had were from playing Call of Duty on the Xbox on a TV stand that sank low into the floors of my Tato’s millhouse. The only close friend I had was my older sister, Kat, and the only times we hung out without my Tato were when she made me dye her hair with jet black box dye and cut it in our communal bathroom’s yellowed bathtub-shower fixture. 



“Lexy, can you stop shaking?” She’d complain very often. I was probably shaking, but also, she couldn’t sit still at all because she was scared that I would snip off her ear. 



“You asked me to do it!” 



“Yeah, I didn’t expect you to be such a pussy about it, though.” Calling a sixteen-year-old boy a pussy was a low blow, even for her. Kat had no room to speak when she kept wincing every time I cut an inch or two of hair above her skin. 



“Whatever. Just shut up. I’m almost done.” 



“Cut it better or I’m gonna tell Tato about your weed problem. And stop leaving hair close to the drain, God, you’re gonna clog it when you wash up.” She rubbed the back of her neck, sore from having to hunch backward while I cut her hair over a plastic bag we separated into two sheets and taped at the bottom of the bathtub. 



“You wanted to dye your hair, and you think that he’s gonna be mad at me for smoking weed sometimes?” 



“Alexei. I do well in school, but you don’t. He’ll be way angrier at you, to be honest. Shut up, and I’ll do your piercings next time he heads to class.” 



“Fine.”  



I reluctantly finished the haircut and cleaned up. She liked how I styled it enough to keep asking me to cut it, and she eventually pierced both my ears and found a friend who could do snakebites. Despite us being from a mainly Orthodox region of Ukraine, our Tato couldn't care less about whatever we did to our appearances, if we didn’t mess up the house. It also helped that he was younger: Kat was born when he was seventeen, and I was born when he was nineteen. He also probably couldn’t muster the effort to scream at us after coming home from class at eleven every other night to wake up at seven the next morning for work.



And that was it. Kat was two years older than me and followed our Tato’s advice to go to med school when she graduated, and she moved out of Chicago to go to UIllinois. Our Tato was hellbent on us pursuing some form of higher education after not finishing his practicing medical license in Simferopol before we left Crimea, and he took night classes after working at a corner store during the day. I just didn’t care much for school, unlike Kat; I got stoned, I learned English to speak it fluently and lose my accent, and I came home.  



But girls liked me enough to try and ask me for my phone number or to hang out after class, but I had some decrepit first-generation iPhone at home that my Tato and I shared. I would give our number to the few girls that pinned me for a foreign, always high, edgy dude, and then they would ignore me for days straight when my Tato texted them back with ‘is this for pharmacy clerk job?’  



From my friends who played video games and didn’t care that I got high immediately after school, I met my first girlfriend because she needed a date to prom for her senior year when I was a sophomore. Her name was Jen, she potently smelled of champagne vanilla body spray, and she had dark brown, long hair with bleached tips. She wore a starkly red dress that looked horrible next to my pale skin, bony, pin-straight frame, and sparrow-colored hair. Jen was my first kiss and my first time, and she also told me to stop talking during sex so that I didn’t say any disjointed English and Ukrainian blotted phrases. Not a horrible choice, because I still sounded like a strangled cat when I slipped into my native accent while rushing my words in English. 



The next two years were blurry. I can only remember the pockets of time that Kat would return home during Christmas to see us, and I could hear her crying at the kitchen table about school when I went upstairs to our room. Sometimes about her workload, her scholarships not taking care of her loans, or guys that hurt her. I always took her choosing not to share her problems with me in university as her not wanting to be close with me at all. To me, anyway, the issues she had with being approached by guys seemed like unnecessary complaints: hell, I would’ve given anything for attention and desire from anyone.  



Before I graduated from high school, our Tato was shot while he was stopping by the Ukrainian Village in the near west side of Chicago before heading to his night classes. It was obviously a targeted attack on the neighborhood following the Crimean annexation, but the suspect, caught on video footage outside the grocery our Tato was shot at, was only charged with manslaughter. Americans *really* do not like to press the terrorism charge on murders, especially when the victims are immigrants on a visa rather than U.S. citizens. 



A few of his coworkers and Kat took a train to the funeral procession in an Orthodox Church in rural, hayfield-surrounded Illinois, and some of our neighbors paid visits to me the following days. I didn’t cry, but I stared at blank walls after taking decorations off them to prepare the house to be moved out of, damp weight boring into my eye sockets for days after. 



I ate dollar store brand Fruit Loops and drank canned espresso shots for meals a few weeks following until I realized I needed to pay off electrical and water bills. My Tato’s bank account was hemorrhaging money to pay for the house’s mortgage, and I was incompetent and unemployed after graduating. Kat told me to suck it up for as long as I could, and that she would give me some leftover money she had from interning at a lab near her school to sponsor me getting out of our childhood home. 



I searched for work over the summer once the house was sold with the help of my neighbor’s real estate agent, got a barely above minimum wage job as a waiter, and leased a studio apartment. All my high school friends were planning to enroll in university that fall, while I was living alone in all my 500 square feet in an apartment complex with Latin ornamented, bright green front doors. But I had a scalloped ceiling, and they didn’t, sooooo.  



With the extra money that I got from Tato’s estate, around a hundred or so dollars after my security deposit and having to split his bank account with Kat, I impulse adopted a cat from a rescue café in town. A sandy orange tabby with a chipped tooth and crooked tan nose that sidled up to my leg within minutes of me entering the building. I picked her up while sitting on a scratched-up armchair, waiting for coffee, and she flailed away from me before dangling her legs straight down like a ragdoll. That established our relationship. I signed her adoption papers the same day and named her Mitsy. 



Incompetent and bored, I turned nineteen and dragged myself to my job every day in a mechanical routine. Being told that I could be something great in the future when I was younger was a high expectation when I crawled back to my apartment after a shift and deflated on a full-size bed every night at nineteen with my cat hogging half of my pillow. Since I wasn’t attending college, I didn’t have the social life that I thought would appear after high school. I wanted the things that I lacked before, that I deserved in the dull fog of my routine.  



In the beginning of winter, just after most of the trees around my apartment turned into brindled, dead stick-like figures that would soon be covered in snow that wouldn’t melt until March, I created an account on a chatting app to try and make friends online—hopefully, close to Chicago, but I would’ve accepted any form of contact at that point. I presented as myself, really, except I attempted to emphasize every trait I knew made me somewhat different. Understanding, biting, alternative, anything that made me seem more of an interesting person who wasn’t constantly coping with a plateauing bank account and being a half-assed hermit. 



After a few days joining base-level gaming chats and communities—all the games I liked were either free or bought way early into high school on the Xbox I took from my old house, so it made my gaming library really, really depressing-looking–I found a direct message in my inbox.  



Before opening it, I navigated to the user’s profile. The profile picture was a blurry, landscape shot in the woods, shot like an indie album cover with the texture of a crackling, glossy-printed photo. Maybe it was a screenshot of an actual album cover; I didn’t investigate further. I knew how to reverse image search, but I assumed that it was from an obscure band and didn’t want to sound stupid pulling information to talk about directly from the internet. 



‘I really like *band name* too; my favorite song is their third most popular song, so that I sound like I know enough about them to be interesting and deep!’ I stopped doing that as soon as I told a customer at work that my favorite Sublime song was *Doin’ Time,* Jen listened to a cover of it in the car ride to prom, and I didn’t know enough of the actual discography to continue making conversation. 



The short biography attached just wrote that he was 26, lived in Aurora, and was interested in computer science and psychology. No idea if that meant he had a degree in either field or not, but I went along with the narrative that he did. The only connection we had was that we both were in a server for cataloguing and chatting about stolen versions of older Xbox and PlayStation games. I didn’t explicitly describe that I was from Illinois in the server or on my profile, but I was secretly really, really happy that he found my profile and was in the area. I opened the message. 

 

**Wednesday, 11 December** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:07 CST*** 

Hey, 

Are you active on here? 

 

I leaned slightly forward to read the screen, squinting at the text on my dim monitor. I rolled up the sleeves of my white dress shirt, feeling the tackiness of a drink that I spilled earlier on the underside of my wrist’s cuff before replying. I knew I didn’t have a lot of time before I needed to change and shower, and Mitsy had dinner already, so she was clawing up the side of my bedframe to lie down. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:13 CST*** 

yeah 

why 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:13 CST*** 

You seem interesting. 

You only talk with other people in the server instead of posting any downloads or asking for Mediafire links. 

What’s that about? 

 

My actual reasoning for using the server as a chat forum rather than a resource for pirating was obvious. I was lonely as hell: you can read above again. So, I answered with a close-to-the-truth lie. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:13 CST*** 

don't know many people irl with the same interest 

esp in my area lol 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:14 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:14 CST*** 

Well, same for me. Lmao. 

You wrote that you are in CST on your profile. 

You live near Chicago? 

 

The jump to discussing my location was a bit abrupt. Especially since he guessed correctly. But, of course, Chicago’s the most populous city in CST. It’s not like I lived in Springfield, and he immediately caught that I did. It was an easy guess. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:14 CST*** 

yeah 

since around spring 2014 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:15 CST*** 

Damn, you could have afforded to move to Chicago five years ago? How old are you? 

 

I forgot that I didn’t disclose my age on my profile. I honestly just assumed that people would think I was on the younger side based on the way I talked. I contemplated telling him—the itch to refuse was *heavily* reinforced by the hour-long assemblies about internet safety in high school and my Tato yelling at me for talking to strangers in Call of Duty lobbies when I was eleven. But I was an adult now, who cared what my age was if I wasn’t like, thirteen? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:15 CST*** 

19 

my dad moved us here to finish his med school 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:15 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:16 CST*** 

Huh. He must’ve been young if he was still finishing med school. 

Was he studying somewhere else? 

 

I felt an electric, scraping shiver pass through me at the fact that he was using the past tense to ask about my Tato. Probably, I’d forgotten some complicated grammar rules in English since graduation, but it was odd that he used ‘must’ve been’ instead of ‘must be.’ I shrugged it off. There was no way he knew that my Tato had passed. I also felt slightly weird that he didn’t end the conversation immediately after discovering the around seven-year gap between us. But I wanted to keep talking to him in the moment. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:16 CST*** 

yeah 

we lived in Ukraina 

\*Ukraine 

\*Crimea 

 

I rapidly corrected and recorrected my native spelling within moments of my second message. I knew enough about people on the internet to also assume that some wouldn’t be 100% absolutely happy with me considering Simferopol and Crimea as Ukraine. 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:17 CST*** 

Oh. 

That explains your move in 2014. 

And your username. 

What does it mean, btw? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:17 CST*** 

just words with similar sounds lol 

i liked pokemon when i was little 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:18 CST*** 

anyway i might need to hop off soon 

just came back from work 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:18 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:18 CST*** 

That sucks. 

Maybe we can talk more later. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:18 CST*** 

yeah, for sure 

 

I moved to press the power-off button on my monitor before sitting back straight in my desk chair. I never got an actual name for E besides his username. And I had a slowly surfacing urge that I wanted to know. I wanted to know so that we could keep talking soon. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:19 CST*** 

btw before i go offline 

what does E stand for? 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:19 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:19 CST***  

Elijah. 

Just wanted to keep my name ambiguous. 

Especially in a server that has actual crime going on, lol. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:19 CST*** 

ahhh 

everybody is a pirate tho lmao. idk if it’s that severe of a crime for me to care 

but i guess you’re right 

anyway, ttyl 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:20 CST*** 

TTYL??? 

What is this, Myspace? 

Goodnight. 

 

I snorted at his very dated comment before going to his profile to change his name displayed on my screen. I kept the autocapitalization of his name since he seemed bent on typing as grammatically correct as possible. I moved to shut off my computer again before I got another ping from the app. 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:21 CST*** 

\*Goodnight, Alexei. 

 

Smiling to myself at his response, I powered off my monitor before realizing that I was even excited that he corrected his dismissal with my name. Ew. Gross, me. I stood up from my desk and kicked my cloth laundry basket from my bathroom door to get inside the cubicle room. Mitsy immediately climbed inside the basket once it was pushed between the corner of the door and my apartment wall. 



While I was getting ready to shower, I hung the top of my dress shirt from the bathroom’s ventilation window after smudging in the drink spill on my shirt cuff with stain remover. I also jabbed myself on the back of one of my piercings while I was taking it out from the bottom of my lip, but just smeared the blood on the inside of my sink’s bowl. I didn’t clean it until the next morning because I really couldn’t care that much until my next shift. I just didn’t think to until I realized how gross it was, yikes. 

 

I didn’t get another reply on the app until a similar time the next night, but I’d changed and fed Mitsy before he sent anything. I also installed the app on my phone earlier during work, just in case I desperately needed the boost of getting a notification on shift to push me through the day. I turned on my monitor and waited for my PC to boot before opening the app again after checking my notifications on other websites. Mitsy leapt behind the monitor, and I had to shoo her away from chewing up wires behind my PC before she slid behind the desk to get out. Within ten minutes of me being online, I got a new ping. 

 

**Thursday, 12 December** 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:30 CST*** ***has sent you a friend request.*** 

 

I stopped and sat back from the computer. There was no actual way that it was Kat. I opened the account’s profile, noticing it had absolutely nothing written in the bio other than ‘hi’. The profile picture was one of the robot anime girls, the one with the blue hair, scrappily drawn on MS Paint but definitely stolen from another website. Damnit, it was probably Kat. 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:31 CST*** 

hi 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:31 CST*** 

? 

is this actually you katya 

how did you find me? 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:31 CST*** 

no 

I just like stealing people’s identities 

hit the Add Friends from Contacts button on your phone, you doof 

 

I groaned, pressing my fingertips deep enough over my closed eyes to feel some pushback before letting go and replying. She was still irritating. What did I expect? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:32 CST*** 

im not on mobile rn you DOOF 

also unlike you i dont like everyone having my contact info on this platform 

why are you using your full name here 

dont you remember what tato taught us about internet safety 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:32 CST*** 

fine 

I’ll change it :( 

\#incel 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:32 CST*** 

IM NOT AN INCEL!!! 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:33 CST*** 

you sound really defensive, RN 

you're the one hanging out on this app all the time 

I'm only on one server and I use it to find funny videos 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:33 CST*** 

u r so annoying 

u dont know my daily Gripes dont judge 

im only on here to download emulators 

 

I was already exhausted from having to advocate for myself to her, so the next message that appeared on my screen made me laugh hard. 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:34 CST*** 

there I changed it 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:34 CST*** 

EW 

YOURE SO GROSS 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:34 CST*** 

LOL 

wait, it won’t let me change back 

it has a cooldown 

NO I can’t do this I can’t live this way 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:35 CST*** 

LOSER 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:35 CST*** 

now our usernames are on level playing terrain 

I’m assuming you haven’t met anyone who knows Ukrainian slang LMAO 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:35 CST*** 

no 

just some weird ppl and one alright dude 

also id expect anyone who speaks ukrainian on here knows what it means bc they r not elderly and senile

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:36 CST*** 

ew 

I’m gonna close this now bc I’m bored 

I’m assuming that you respond here faster than texting 

 

I knew that texting was a lot easier for her when she was at her internship, but I didn’t need to talk to her on my phone if I wasn’t in an emergency. Besides, it would just help me after work to only use one app for messaging.  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:36 CST*** 

yeah wtv 

have fun with ur big important studies 

cure cancer tmrw 

 

I closed the conversation, almost immediately getting a notification after. 

 

**Thursday, 12 December** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:37 CST*** 

Are you online? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:41 CST*** 

yeah 

usually people are online when they have the online status but idk 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:41 CST*** 

Haha, funny. 

You should go make buddies in an improv troop.  

They’d love you. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:42 CST*** 

would love to do that  

except id be shamed for not getting into their school 

flogged in the university town square 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:42 CST*** 

You’re not in college? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:42 CST*** 

no 

my dad didnt invest much in an american college fund 

we were this thing called immigrants 

idrc about further education anyway 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:43 CST*** 

Why? 

You’re smart enough. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:43 CST*** 

money 

im also not that smart lol 

didnt get good grades in hs 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:43 CST*** 

It’s hilarious that you think that you’re not. 

But, yeah. Grades might be an issue. 

Money is also an issue. 

 

He stopped responding for a second, making me sit back in my seat. Maybe, he just wanted to end the conversation early; it was kind of a lost cause to convince me that I was even intelligent. I was a stoner in school and barely cared about anything other than speaking English fluently enough to not sound stupid and have no accent. Which sucked, because I couldn’t fall away naturally from my accent with my Tato and Kat at the house speaking in Ukrainian, so the bitter, Slavic tone remained.  

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:45 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:45 CST*** 

So. 

Do you work now? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:45 CST*** 

yeah 

waiter at a fancier restaurant 

get to wear a nice uniform and get paid subpar wages

get to be a businessman without doing business 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:45 CST*** 

Seems really lucrative and long-term. 

You want to stay in that field forever? 

Minimum wage? 

 

I snorted to myself at his question before sitting with my thoughts, biting at the inside of my cheek as I tried to explain the route to any career path in my mind. I didn’t think about the future much, I guess I assumed that I would bounce between occupations my entire life and build up a decent resume to, I don’t know, become an executive somewhere? Manage a store, at least? What even was my answer? I totally couldn’t pay for university; I could barely pay for my groceries and Mitsy’s supplies then. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:47 CST*** 

meehh 

sure 

i dont plan on doing much else 

my dream is to become a rock and pop out of reality 

or like phase into the pop art dimension like that one spongebob episode 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:47 CST*** 

Slow response that time. 

Are you even sure? 

 

I thought, ‘really, no.’  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:47 CST*** 

yeah 

i need money and can’t pay for further education since i cant take out loans

not a us citizen 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:48 CST*** 

Maybe something could help with that. 

In the future. 

 

I blinked a few times to see if I was reading his message right or if the text on my screen was warped from how low-quality my monitor was. *What?* 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:48 CST*** 

what are you, the divine oracle? 

the chance of me winning the lottery is very slim 

or finding a wealthy old person to marry 

old wealthy person? 

what comes first 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:49 CST*** 

Wealthy old person was correct, technically. 

Descriptors come first. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:49 CST*** 

ok english professor 

what do you even do for a living 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:49 CST*** 

Coding. 

Because I went to school and got a computer science degree. And a Master’s. 

 

His behavior made a lot more sense now that I knew he had a graduate degree. Of course, he wanted me to go to college; he basically was the spokesman of post-grad education. Nobody in America who *doesn’t* like education and has common sense goes to school for more than a bachelor’s degree. With that much money invested, you’re just cleaning the scum off the boots of the school’s dean with your tongue. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:50 CST*** 

woooahh 

you must be rolling in money rn 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:50 CST*** 

To you? Yeah. 

I made enough to pay off my loans for graduate school. 

Could probably pay for another round. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:51 CST*** 

the flexing wow 

wdym you can pay for another round??? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:51 CST*** 

I mean it seriously, Alexei. 

I could. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:51 CST*** 

you use my name like its a slur lol 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:51 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:52 CST***  

Whatever. 

So, you live in Chicago at nineteen and have stable enough income to, again, live in Chicago at nineteen. 

You really have nobody else to talk to? 

 

His change in demeanor seemed somewhat justified with how I nabbed at him for using my name, but really? It felt more awful than I wanted to admit how condescending his message was. Yeah, I didn’t in the moment after Kat went offline. My hands immediately moved to start typing back mindlessly while I could hear Mitsy rummaging under my bed, suddenly lively. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:52 CST*** 

no i dont 

kinda sucks that u bring it up lmfao 

twist the knife harder, oh grand tech wizard! 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:52 CST*** 

Didn’t mean to. 

Was just wondering why you would want to talk to me in your position. 

No girlfriend or anything? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:53 CST*** 

no 

last time i dated someone was in high school lol 

 

I stared at my message, slightly shocked that I had willingly brought down my ego. I didn’t even know why I decided to confess that I hadn’t been with anyone for that long. He seemed comfortable enough chatting with me to deserve an honest response. Right? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:53 CST*** 

That’s weird. 

You’re a good enough guy. 

Even if you’re a bit immature. 

But you’re still young, I’ll give you that. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:53 CST*** 

im rlly not great 

might be on ahole level 

not that attractive either 

face only a deadbeat mother could love 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:54 CST*** 

That’s a contradiction for sure. LMAO. 

Besides, there’s no evidence that you’re not alright looking. 

 

I paused, moving my hands off my keyboard and itching to immediately respond with ‘and you’ll never get any’ but knew that for some reason, I wanted him to know what I looked like. There was a rising pool of dread like bile in my stomach at the idea of him thinking I was ugly, but I replied. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:55 CST*** 

ill send a pic of myself if u share something about urself 

guy who wants to remain anonymous bc he pirates Tony Hawk Pro Skater after a day at his very serious coding job 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:55 CST*** 

Sure. 

Cool dig. 

I’m prepared for the worst. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:55 CST*** 

u commit to ur side of the deal first 

sharing is caring!!! 

 

I cringed a little–actually, more–at my message. Why was I so eager for him to respond? I mean, why did I let him know I was so eager to respond? Shaking it off, I stood up to grab my phone, discarded on the nightstand I assembled the weekend before. I remembered leaving the hammer I built it with on my kitchen counter and just, not moving it for a whole work week instead of finding the toolbox it was in. I was shocked that Mitsy hadn’t pushed it off the counter’s ledge yet when she was trying to scrape up the sides of my bedposts while I was pacing around, yowling at me when I got close to try to detach her claws from the wooden bedframe with my phone in my other hand.



 I unlocked my phone and thoughtlessly returned to my monitor setup while I searched for a decent selfie in my camera roll. I sent the photo to my computer and checked my direct messages again for anything new. 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:56 CST*** 

Fine. 

I’m 187 centimeters tall and weigh 86 kilograms.  

Had to convert. 

 

I barely read over the message before I attached the photo. I remember it being a selfie I used for a dating app a month before the conversation. Some well-lit photo facing my studio’s window that I took directly after work, when my shirt didn’t need much adjusting to be neat again.  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:57 CST*** 

\[Image\] 

holy shit u r tall lol 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:57 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:58 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:58 CST*** 

You don’t have a girlfriend? 

You’re lying. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:58 CST*** 

not at all 

also y drop that kinda info 

not like im ur doctor and need those to make sure u r not Dying of malnutrition 

wait u wanted to flex on me wow 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:59 CST*** 

You’re going to ignore the picture you just sent? 

 

I laughed at his message. Yeah, of course I was ‘going to ignore it.’ I didn’t think I was that good-looking to warrant an awed response. I knew I was at least average; I worked out four days a week in the mornings and didn’t eat like a hog anymore. My hair sucked; it was always between dirty blond and ash brown growing up. And I compensated for having sandy pale skin with dark metals, so I looked grungier. I passed in looks. That’s it. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:59 CST*** 

yeah 

im alright looking 

??? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:00 CST*** 

Not to be weird, 

You are insanely attractive. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:00 CST*** 

thats bordering on weird, yeah 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:00 CST*** 

I mean it seriously. 

That’s you? 

Holy shit. 

 

Yeah, I didn’t believe what he was saying. At all. But it made me want to. Badly. I didn’t know why, but I needed somebody to tell me that after so long of not genuinely being called hot by people I knew. People I cared about enough to respect. Maybe he couldn’t tell that? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:01 CST*** 

yeah?? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:01 CST*** 

Damn. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:01 CST*** 

damn what 

u r leaving me with very vague short responses! 

har har 

  

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:01 CST*** 

Nothing. 

If you don’t want me to say anything weird. 

 

‘Anything weird?’ Oh. That meant something to me. I reached over my desk to shut off my monitor like it was a fight-or-flight response before stopping myself, letting my hand return to my keyboard. I didn’t even notice myself replying. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:02 CST*** 

no 

say it 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:02 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:02 CST*** 

I would see you right now if I could. 

 

A gut reaction flared up inside of me to deny. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:02 CST*** 

u cant mean that for sure 

but ill let it be 

haha 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:03 CST*** 

You’re too insecure. 

Too insecure about your looks. 

Anyways, I need to sign off. 

 

His emphasis on how insecure I seemed was weirdly...soothing? It felt like somebody knew enough about me to tell me I deserved something. He was telling me that I should’ve been prouder of myself. And I needed that. It was warmth under my skin when nobody else would provide it. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:03 CST*** 

??? 

ok 

just say u gtg it feels like im talking to george washington if he had a Windows 10 virtual machine on his newtonian instruments 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:03 CST*** 

Fine. 

GTG, Alexei. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:04 CST*** 

its still weird all capitalized and in complete textbook grammar but ok 

goodnight, elijah 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:04 CST*** 

Oh, so we’re on goodnight terms now? 

You didn’t send me that yesterday. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:04 CST*** 

yeah bc u didnt call me hot yesterday 

idot 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:04 CST*** 

I didn’t know that yesterday. 

You type like a child and not a grown adult. 

It’s a little endearing. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:05 CST*** 

woohoo endearing! 

like the babies that look like wrinkly old men 

just like me

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:05 CST*** 

Shut up about your appearance before I keep talking about it. 

Goodnight, Alexei. 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:05 CST is offline.*** 

 

I inhaled deeply and closed the app within seconds of him going offline, blankly watching the monitor’s screen noise move on my desktop wallpaper. I had to remind myself to blink as my eyes dried up from being open for so long. The drone of Mitsy shuffling through my sheets when she finally jumped onto my bed became audible again in my mind. Did I read his messages right? He couldn’t have been. He probably didn’t like me. I stretched over the backrest of my desk chair, hearing my back crack, before standing up from my setup. 

I needed to not think for a while after that. I boiled water in the microwave to make tea and leaned my forehead against the tinted door for the full 90 seconds, like I wanted to get radiation poisoning. I sat down on my bed and opened my phone, watching Mitsy try and wiggle towards me from her giant, tangled duvet and sheet island. ",1,1754498949.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False
1mj9wf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1mj9wf2/explore_the_best_ceiling_speakers_jbl_8128_and/,Explore the Best Ceiling Speakers JBL 8128 and Are They Worth It,"JBL 8128 is a name that seems to pop up when discussing in-ceiling speakers for commercial use. After spending a good amount of time testing it, I can see why it has earned its place in discussions about restaurant, café, and bar audio setups. It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. While I found many aspects to appreciate, there are also areas that could be improved. Let’s dive into my experience.

**Sound Quality that Catches Attention**

Good sound is paramount when you’re dealing with speakers, and these certainly deliver in most cases. With an 8-inch full-range driver, the performance is crisp, especially in midrange tonality. Whether it’s background music in a café or clear audio for announcements in a retail store, the sound spread did not disappoint. I noticed the clarity it maintained even at higher volumes, managing to avoid distortion. However, if you’re looking for super bass-heavy beats, this set might not entirely satisfy audiophiles more drawn to thundering lows.

**Ease of Installation and Design**

The simplicity of the installation process genuinely surprised me. With a ceiling mount system crafted for straightforward assembly, I didn’t find myself crawling through an endless manual. The build feels solid yet not too heavy, which makes placing them less of a hassle. Designed in white, it blends seamlessly into most ceilings without sticking out awkwardly. These speakers are a practical choice for anyone prioritizing neat setups and visual subtleness.

**Compatible Across Multiple Devices**

Another major win is its broad range of compatibility. I connected it to several devices—laptops, MP3 players, smartphones, and even a larger setup with a projector. Each device integration felt intuitive and quick, which is important when you’re setting up in real-world environments where time is often limited. 

**Pluses**

- Crisp midrange sound reproduction  
- Minimal distortion at high volumes  
- Sleek, unobtrusive design perfect for blending into ceilings  
- Broad compatibility with multiple devices  

[Check JBL 8128 price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b00ki455lc/)

**Built-In Features That Add Utility**

While testing, I found myself appreciating the built-in microphone feature. It’s not groundbreaking, but for environments like restaurants or conference rooms, it adds additional utility. You won’t have to invest in separate mic systems for basic needs since this covers simple voice clarification tasks effectively. Despite being a commercial-use speaker, its potential for adaptability shows through such small but helpful details.

**Power Configuration and Durability**

What’s great is the versatility in power levels. With four power settings available, it provides options for different room sizes and requirements. For example, a booming café versus a quaint dining space would benefit from diverse power options. Furthermore, the materials used feel reliable, even though at 3 pounds per unit it leans on the lighter side. The limited warranty provided also instilled some confidence in long-term usage.

**Favorable Attributes**

- Straightforward installation process even for first-time users  
- Built-in microphone adds functionality  
- Four distinct power levels adjust well to varying room sizes  

**Shortcomings**

Like most products, there were frustrations. First, the lack of waterproofing disappointed me. Given that bars or even certain cafés may face moisture concerns (think humidity or small liquid spills), this marked a noticeable weak spot for me. Secondly, the bass output could use improvement. Though primarily designed for commercial clarity, a bit more depth wouldn’t hurt. Being stereo-only, surround sound options are limited, which may deter some audio enthusiasts seeking higher versatility.

- No water resistance  
- Limited bass depth for heavier audio preferences  
- Surround sound configuration is not expansive  

**Product Alternatives**

There are other products in the market worth mentioning here. Polk Audio RC80i speakers, for instance, bring waterproofing into the mix, making them more versatile for areas prone to moisture. However, they lack the built-in microphone feature that the JBL 8128 offers. Then you have Yamaha NSIC800WH in-ceiling speakers, which provide stunning sound spectrum coverage but are harder to install compared to the user-friendly design of this product. JBL clearly focuses on ease and practicality for commercial setups, though audiophiles might lean toward options like the Yamaha for superior acoustics.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

When evaluating whether this speaker system is worth what you pay, I’d say it offers pretty solid value for money. While it doesn’t surpass its rivals in every category, it largely justifies its price through easy installation, compatibility, and overall performance. If you happen to prioritize businesses like restaurants or coffee shops, this seems to fit snugly into the “smart investment” category. Despite a few weaknesses, such as no waterproofing or extra rich bass, the benefits significantly outweigh these concerns for commercial users.

1mj9vmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1mj9vmw/i_hate_that_i_am_asked_why_im_still_with_him/,I hate that I am asked why I'm still with him.,"I had asked him to move out, he refuses. I had asked him for space, he refuses. I had tried to remove myself physically, he refuses. I demanded he leaves, he refuses. I call my friend to come get me, he tries to take my phone from me, I get to the elevator, he gets between me and the door. 

So I ran out, and then I hid as he called me over and over. I stay with a friend all night and turn off my phone. I come home the next morning to find my dog missing and my home trashed. Holes in the wall and door, tv smashed and coffee table wrecked so hard that all four legs had come off. 

I had asked him to help, or change, or move out for the sake of saving our relationship. I had broken up with him before only to have him beg for hours, and days, crossing boundaries, trying to come into my room and my bed, bashing his head into the ground, threaten to throw himself off the balcony. People had asked why I had let him back into my life, and I am so tired of having to explain that I tried and I did but he won't leave, not till the cops got involved. 

He's in jail now, my dog is back home with me. I am too tired to take things to the dump, I only have the one tv he broke so I can't even watch anything to distract myself with. So out of boredom, I started decorating the carnage he left behind, I framed the hole in my wall, and I put flowers in the hole in my tv, painted it, put disco glass on it. I don't know when he gets out of jail, but the anxiety meds are helping me cope.

I just made the biggest mistake of my life. The words kept ringing in my head as I opened my eyes.  
  
The air around me was heavy, too warm, and thick with a scent that sent a shiver down my spine. My stomach churned as I blinked again, my body sluggish and sore in ways I didn’t want to think about. The ceiling above me was unfamiliar, and the bed I was lying in wasn’t mine. Panic set in, tightening its claws around my chest.  
  
I sat up slowly, every movement feeling like it required monumental effort. The sheet slipped from my shoulders, exposing bare skin. My breath hitched as I realized I was naked. Completely naked.  
  
No, no, no. This can’t be happening.  
  
Memories of the night before were fragmented and elusive, like trying to hold water in my hands. The last clear moment I could recall was Reed dragging me to Brittany’s house, his excitement contagious even though I hadn’t wanted to go.  
  
Brittany had thrown the party to celebrate graduating high school in two months. She’d made a point of inviting everyone, even Omegas like me. I hadn’t believed her intentions were kind—Brittany never did anything out of kindness—but Reed insisted it would be fun.  
  
I’d followed him reluctantly, keeping close to the edges of the crowd once we arrived. The music had been loud, the drinks flowing freely. I didn’t belong there, and I knew it. Yet Reed had smiled at me, and his warmth had made me believe, just for a moment, that it might be okay.  
  
But then there was...nothing. A blank space where my memories should have been.  
  
And now, here I was, naked in bed with—  
  
I turned my head, and the world tilted.  
  
Rayne.  
  
His blonde hair was tousled from sleep, his forest-green eyes closed, and his face relaxed in a way I’d never seen before. He looked peaceful, almost innocent. But that wasn’t what made my stomach drop.  
  
It was the marks.  
  
My skin was littered with them—hickeys, bites, and the unmistakable proof of who had made them. My mating gland throbbed, a dull ache that pulsed through my body, and I reached up to touch it instinctively. The mark was there, searing and real.  
  
Rayne had marked me.  
  
I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from screaming. This can’t be happening.  
  
My best friend’s boyfriend. Reed’s boyfriend. I had slept with him.  
  
No. No, I couldn’t have.  
  
I slid out of the bed, careful not to make a sound. My legs were shaky, my body protesting every movement, but I forced myself to stay upright. My clothes were a crumpled heap on the floor, and I grabbed them quickly, pulling my shirt over my head with trembling hands.  
  
The mark on my neck pulsed again, stronger this time, and I froze. It wasn’t just pain—it was a pull, an overwhelming need to turn back and crawl into Rayne’s arms. My Omega instincts screamed at me to claim my place beside my Alpha, to bury myself in his scent until the world knew I was his.  
  
I clenched my teeth, forcing myself to breathe through the haze. This wasn’t me. This wasn’t what I wanted.  
  
I had to leave.  
  
I shoved my legs into my pants, fumbling with the zipper. The movement was clumsy and loud, and I winced as the sound echoed through the room.  
  
Behind me, a low growl rumbled.  
  
“What the hell?!”  
  
I froze, my back to the bed. My heart raced as I heard the rustle of sheets, then his voice again, sharper this time.  
  
“Amber?”  
  
I turned slowly, dreading what I’d see. Rayne was sitting up now, the blanket pooling around his waist. His chest was bare, and the marks I’d left on him were just as visible as the ones he’d left on me. His eyes were locked on me, wide with confusion, then narrowing as realization dawned.  
  
“What the actual f\*\*k did you do?”  
  
I flinched at his tone, anger flaring in my chest despite the knot of guilt lodged there. “What did I do? I don’t even remember last night!”  
  
Rayne’s lip curled in a snarl. “You don’t remember?” His voice was mocking, venomous. “Convenient. Let me guess—you’re going to play the victim now, right? Pretend you didn’t know exactly what you were doing?”  
  
I stared at him, disbelief and hurt colliding in my chest. “I didn’t—”  
  
“Don’t act innocent, Amber. You knew exactly what you were doing. You used your wretched Omega scent to lure me into bed.”  
  
His words hit like a slap, but he wasn’t finished.  
  
“You knew better than anyone that Reed is my boyfriend. Your best friend. And still, you let this happen.” He sneered, his lips curling as he called me unprintable names, each one cutting deeper than the last.  
  
My wolf whimpered, the sound reverberating through my mind like a physical blow, hurt that our Alpha was reprimanding us. But I refused to back down and let instinct take over.  
  
“You’re a coward, Rayne,” I said, my voice shaking but defiant. “Blaming me when it’s obvious I’m the victim here.”  
  
Rayne’s eyes flashed, and his laugh was sharp and humorless. “Bullshit. You approached me despite knowing you were in heat. Do you even realize what you did? Your intoxicating pheromones were stinking up the place. They triggered my rut—my rut, Amber! I was barely holding it back as it was!”  
  
“I wasn’t in heat!” I snapped, my voice cracking under the weight of his accusations. “Someone drugged me, they must have slipped heat inducing drugs in my drink as some kind of sick prank. I don’t know who, or why, but I felt it coming on. The last thing I remember was trying to leave the party so I wouldn’t be—”  
  
My throat tightened as the words caught. I forced them out anyway. “So I wouldn’t be raped by every Alpha there.”  
  
Rayne’s expression flickered, but only for a moment. His skepticism was still etched in every tense line of his face. “Of course you'd come up with an excuse,” he muttered. “I shouldn’t have bothered helping you.”  
  
I stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest. “What are you talking about?”  
  
Rayne ran a hand through his hair, his frustration palpable. “You were outside Brittany’s house, wandering around like a f\*\*\*\*\*g i\*\*\*t. You were already in heat, Amber—completely senseless. Barely even able to walk, with slick running down your legs.”  
  
My face burned with humiliation, but he didn’t stop.  
  
“I couldn’t just leave you there,” he continued, his voice rising. “Any Alpha would’ve jumped at the chance to take you. But the moment I got close…” He trailed off, his jaw tightening.  
  
“What?” I demanded.  
  
Rayne met my eyes, and the raw emotion there made my stomach twist. “I felt it. The bond. You’re my destined mate, Amber. And the second I realized that, everything else went to hell. Your pheromones were so strong, I couldn’t think. I couldn’t stop it. My rut hit me like a freight train, and instinct completely took over.”  
  
He ran a hand down his face, his shoulders tense. “I don’t even remember much after that. Just getting you into a room. Stripping off our clothes. The rest is a blur.”  
  
“It wasn’t my fault,” I said, my voice trembling but steady enough to hold my ground. “I never wanted this to happen. Do you think I wanted you to be my mate?” I shook my head, taking a shaky breath. “I would’ve been happy if it were anyone else. Anyone but you.”  
  
My throat tightened as I continued. “You were the last person I’d want to get involved with. You belong to Reed. You have no idea what this does to me, knowing I betrayed Reed like this. He’s the only person who’s ever stood by me, the only one who’s ever cared. And now I’ve ruined everything. But maybe…” My voice faltered. “Maybe this is the Moon Goddess’ plan. Maybe it was supposed to happen.”  
  
Rayne’s expression darkened in an instant, his face twisting in anger. “Shut up,” he snapped, his voice sharp enough to cut. “Just shut the f\*\*k up, Amber. You’ve done enough already.”  
  
His words were a dagger to the chest, sharp and unforgiving. But what hurt most was the look in his eyes—like I was the worst mistake he’d ever made.  
  
“The only thing I regret more than any of this,” he growled, “is marking you.”  
  
Tears welled up in my eyes as the mark on my neck flared with pain, a deep, searing ache that radiated through my body. My wolf whimpered, the sound echoing in my mind, but I refused to let the tears fall. I clenched my fists, grounding myself in the sting of my nails digging into my palms.  
  
Rayne’s jaw tightened as his gaze flicked to my face, his growl deepening at the sight of my pitiful state. “Stop looking at me like that,” he muttered, his voice laced with frustration. He turned abruptly, pacing the room with heavy, deliberate steps.  
  
“What the hell are we supposed to tell Reed?” he said, his voice sharp and bitter. “How do we even begin to explain this?”  
  
Before I could respond, a sharp knock echoed through the room.  
  
“Rayne? Are you in there?”  
  
My blood turned to ice.  
  
Reed.

“Amber, get in the bathroom. Now.” Rayne hissed, his voice barely above a whisper, his tone sharp and commanding.  
  
“What?” I whispered back, frozen in place as panic surged through me. Reed’s knocking on the door grew louder, more insistent.  
  
Rayne cursed under his breath and grabbed my arm, practically shoving me toward the bathroom. “Just go. Now!”  
  
I stumbled into the small, dimly lit bathroom, clutching the edge of the sink to keep myself upright. The door clicked shut behind me, and I heard the muffled sound of Rayne throwing on his clothes as Reed’s voice carried through the door.  
  
“Rayne? Open up! What the hell are you doing in there?”  
  
“Give me a second,” Rayne called back, his tone strained but even.  
  
My heart raced as I leaned against the wall, every muscle in my body tense. My hands trembled, and I pressed them against my stomach, trying to will myself to calm down.  
  
The door creaked open, and I held my breath as Rayne finally let Reed in.  
  
“Finally,” Reed said, his voice muffled through the bathroom door. “I’ve been knocking forever. What are you even doing in here? And where did you go last night? You practically disappeared on me.”  
  
“I needed a moment,” Rayne said smoothly, his tone calm but firm. “The guys pulled me away for drinks and after the party last night, my head’s been killing me. This was the only quiet spot I could find this morning.”  
  
Reed let out a soft laugh, tinged with concern. “Yeah, Brittany’s parties are chaos. I swear someone spiked the punch. My head’s pounding like crazy.”  
  
I pressed my ear closer to the door, holding my breath as their conversation continued. Relief washed over me when Reed didn’t push Rayne any further.  
  
Thank the goddess Betas can’t smell pheromones, I thought. Reed couldn’t sense my scent clinging to Rayne or the bond between us. If he’d been an Alpha, the entire room would’ve reeked of me and Rayne, and no excuse in the world could’ve saved us.  
  
“You’re looking a little pale,” Rayne said softly, his voice taking on a warm, affectionate tone. “Let me drive you home. You need to rest.”  
  
Reed chuckled, the sound light but laced with teasing. “Rest? Babe, I don’t need rest. You know what I need?”  
  
My breath hitched as I slowly and methodically cracked the bathroom door open just slightly, ensuring not to make a sound. Through the crack, I could see Reed step closer to Rayne, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.  
  
He wrapped his arms around Rayne’s neck, pulling their bodies flush together. “I need you,” Reed whispered, his voice dipping low and suggestive. “You always know how to make me feel better. Just give me what I need, and I promise I’ll feel good as new.”  
  
There was no mistaking the meaning in his words, the way his hands trailed up Rayne’s back and his lips hovered near Rayne’s ear. He wanted s\*x, and he wasn’t being subtle about it.  
  
A low growl rumbled in my chest before I could stop it, and I clamped my hand over my mouth in horror. My wolf snarled possessively, her voice echoing in my mind. Mine. He’s ours. Get him away from him. Now.  
  
I bit down hard on my lip, forcing my wolf back into submission. Not now. Not like this.  
  
Rayne placed his hands gently on Reed’s waist, his touch gentle but firm as he leaned back just slightly. “Reed,” he said softly, his voice steady and full of warmth, “you know I’d do anything for you. But right now, you need to take care of yourself. Let me take you home, make sure you eat something, and I’ll give you the hangover meds myself.”  
  
Reed pouted, leaning into Rayne’s touch. “You’re too good to me, you know that? What did I do to deserve such a sweet boyfriend?”  
  
Rayne didn’t reply, but I saw the flicker of guilt in his eyes before he quickly masked it with a soft smile.  
  
Reed smiled up at Rayne, his brown eyes filled with love and adoration. Then he pulled Rayne down into a kiss, and my stomach twisted painfully.  
  
It wasn’t a simple kiss. It was intense, consuming, and so full of passion it was unbearable to watch. Reed’s hands threaded through Rayne’s blonde hair, tugging him closer as their mouths moved together in perfect sync. The kiss was hungry, demanding, and filled with an intimacy that spoke of years of love and trust.  
  
Rayne’s hands slid down to Reed’s waist, pulling him flush against his body. His fingers gripped Reed’s hips tightly as if he couldn’t bear to let go. Their kiss deepened, and a soft, breathy sound escaped Reed’s lips as Rayne tilted his head, angling for more.  
  
It was raw and unfiltered, a display of a love so deep that it felt like a physical blow. My chest ached as I watched, tears welling in my eyes until they blurred my vision.  
  
Before, I wouldn’t have cared. But now, with the bond tying me to Rayne, the sight of him showing this kind of affection to someone else felt like my heart was being ripped apart piece by piece.  
  
The tears spilled over, hot and silent as they rolled down my cheeks. I pressed a hand to the mark on my neck, its pulsing thrum mocking me.  
  
When they finally pulled away, Reed rested his forehead against Rayne’s and smiled softly. “I’m the luckiest guy in the world.”  
  
Rayne’s smile was faint, his jaw tight, but he nodded. “Come on. Let’s get you home.”  
  
Reed let Rayne guide him out of the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.  
  
I stayed frozen in place for a long moment, my legs refusing to move. Finally, I stepped out of the bathroom, my knees buckling as I crumpled to the floor.  
  
The tears came harder now, sobs shaking my chest as I pressed my hands to my face. My life had never been easy, but I had never expected it to get this complicated.  
  


# Chapter 3

For as long as I could remember, my life had been a series of struggles and disappointments. Being an Omega wasn’t just a curse—it was a brand, a mark that said I was worthless from the moment I was born.  
  
My mother died giving birth to me, and my father made sure I never forgot it. To him, I was the reason she was gone, the reason his life fell apart. He didn’t call me his daughter; he called me a murderer, a killer who had stolen the woman he loved. My earliest memories were filled with his cold, unforgiving eyes and the sharp bite of his words.  
  
It wasn’t enough for him to hate me—my brothers followed his lead, treating me as though I didn’t exist or, worse, as though I was something to be ashamed of. They were Alpha warriors, strong and respected in the Pack, everything I wasn’t. To them, I was weak, a constant reminder of our family’s disgrace.  
  
For years, I tried to earn their love. I thought if I worked hard enough, stayed out of their way, or did everything perfectly, they might see me differently. But no matter what I did, it was never enough.  
  
When I was fourteen, the day I got my wolf should’ve been the turning point. The day I presented should’ve given me a chance to prove myself, to show my family and the Pack that I wasn’t as useless as they thought. But instead, it was the day everything fell apart for good.  
  
I’ll never forget the moment Irma, my wolf, emerged, and I presented as an Omega. The look on my father’s face was one of pure disgust, his lips curling into a sneer as he spat the words that would define the rest of my life.  
  
“You’re no daughter of mine,” he said, his voice cold and final. “Get out of my house. I never want to see you again.”  
  
There was no argument, no hesitation. He grabbed a garbage bag, tossed my clothes inside, and shoved it into my arms. I stood there, frozen, as he slammed the door behind me. I’d been disowned, thrown out like trash because I wasn’t good enough—because I’d been born an Omega.  
  
I ended up at the Pack shelter, a crumbling, overcrowded building meant for Omegas who had nowhere else to go. But calling it a shelter was a joke. The roof leaked when it rained, the walls were covered in mildew, and the floors were hard and cold. There weren’t enough beds, so I slept on the floor with nothing but a thin blanket to keep me warm.  
  
Even among the other Omegas, I was an outcast. My red hair and freckles made me stand out, and the others latched onto it immediately.  
  
“Ugly,” they’d call me. “Freckle-face. You don’t belong here.”  
  
They pushed me around, stole what little food I managed to get, and made it clear that I wasn’t welcome. I learned to survive on scraps, keeping my head down and staying out of their way. But even then, they found ways to make my life miserable.  
  
I cried myself to sleep more nights than I could count, curling into a ball to block out the cold and the hunger. But as much as it hurt, I refused to let it break me.  
  
Education became my escape. School was the only place where I could pretend, even for a little while, that I was more than just an Omega. I threw myself into my studies, burying myself in textbooks and assignments.  
  
While other Omegas grumbled about being forced to attend school, I was grateful for every second of it. I dreamed of becoming a doctor, of leaving the Pack behind and building a life where I wasn’t defined by the rank I’d been born into.  
  
I imagined myself saving lives, making a difference, and proving to everyone that I was more than the useless, weak girl they saw.  
  
But dreams didn’t come easy for someone like me. Every day was a battle—to push past the hunger gnawing at my stomach, to ignore the exhaustion weighing down my limbs, to block out the taunts and whispers that followed me everywhere I went.  
  
And then there was Reed.  
  
Reed was my one bright spot, the only person who ever made me feel like I wasn’t completely alone. He was bold, sassy, and unapologetically himself, with a sharp tongue and a quick wit that kept everyone on their toes.  
  
He didn’t care that I was an Omega. He didn’t care that the rest of the Pack hated me. From the moment we met, he treated me like I was someone worth knowing.  
  
He stood up for me when no one else would, his biting remarks shutting down anyone who tried to push me around.  
  
“Got something to say?” he’d snap at my bullies, his coffee-brown eyes blazing. “Go ahead. I dare you. Let’s see how brave you are when someone fights back.”  
  
He dragged me to parties like Brittany’s, insisting that I deserved to have fun, even when I didn’t believe him.  
  
“You need to live a little,” he’d say, grabbing my hand and pulling me along with that mischievous grin of his. “Who cares what anyone thinks? You’re Amber freaking Queen, and they’re all jealous because they know they can’t touch you.”  
  
“You’re ridiculous,” I’d mutter, trying to hide my smile.  
  
“And you love me for it,” he’d shoot back, his laugh bright and infectious.  
  
He was my best friend, my only friend, the only person who made me feel like I mattered.  
  
And now, I’d betrayed him in the worst way imaginable.  
  
I pressed my hands to my face, the tears spilling over as the weight of everything crashed down on me. How was I supposed to look him in the eye after what had happened? How was I supposed to pretend that nothing had changed?  
  
How long could I keep this secret before Reed found out the truth?  
  
And more importantly, what would happen now that Rayne—his Rayne—was bound to me as my mate?

The walk back to the shelter was a blur, my mind spiraling in endless loops around the bond thrumming at the base of my neck. Rayne's mark felt like a brand, burning against my skin, a constant reminder that he was mine—and worse, that I was his.  
  
I didn’t want to think about him. I didn’t want to picture him with Reed, his hands on him, his lips pressing against his—no, I couldn’t go there. I refused to go there.  
  
Once I got to my room, I locked the door behind me, grabbed a towel, and headed straight for the bathroom. The water in the tiny stall ran cold—it always did—but I didn’t care. I scrubbed myself furiously, scrubbing until my skin turned red, desperate to wash away the scent of Rayne that still clung to me.  
  
But no matter how hard I scrubbed, it wasn’t enough. The bond wouldn’t let me forget. It was a cruel tether, making me hyper-aware of every beat of his heart, every breath he took, as if he were right there with me. It was sweet, torturous intimacy, and I hated how much I craved it.  
  
When I finally stepped out of the bathroom, the mate mark on my neck still tingled, a constant presence. I couldn’t let anyone see it—not here, not now. I grabbed a scent patch from my drawer, pressing it over the mark. It wouldn’t erase the bond, but at least it would hide the evidence.  
  
After throwing my clothes into a bucket, I began scrubbing them clean. The water turned cloudy with soap and the combined scents of Rayne and me. I worked at it until my arms ached, scrubbing until there was no trace left.  
  
Taking the bucket outside, I let out a breath, thinking I could finally hang my clothes and get some peace. But the second I stepped into the yard, I froze.  
  
Reed was waiting for me.  
  
“Amber!” he called, waving with his usual bright smile. “There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”  
  
My stomach dropped. The scent patch hid the mark, but there was no way to cover the other evidence—Rayne’s hickeys, the bites he’d painted down my neck and chest like I was some kind of damn trophy.  
  
Reed’s gaze zeroed in immediately. His smile morphed into a smirk. “Well, well, well, what do we have here?” He stepped closer, his finger lightly tracing one of the bruises on my collarbone. “Amber Queen, you sly little minx. Here I was, worried sick about you disappearing in the middle of Brittany’s party, and it turns out you were out having the time of your life!”  
  
I tried to pull back, but Reed wasn’t having it.  
  
“Don’t even think about hiding these,” he teased, his grin widening. “Look at all these love bites! Goddess, girl, you got mauled. So, who’s the lucky guy—or girl?” He leaned closer, waggling his eyebrows. “Come on, spill! I need details.”  
  
“I don’t want to talk about it,” I said, my voice tight as I turned toward the clothesline.  
  
But Reed was nothing if not persistent. He followed me, his laughter trailing behind him as I hung up the first shirt.  
  
“Oh, don’t you dare play coy with me,” he said. “Amber, this is monumental! You never date, you never even look at anyone, and now you show up looking like you spent the night with a whole pack of Alphas. You have to tell me something.”  
  
“I said I don’t want to talk about it,” I snapped, sharper than I intended.  
  
Reed blinked, taken aback for a moment, but his grin returned just as quickly. “Fine, fine. Keep your secrets. I’m just glad you finally got laid. Honestly, I was starting to think you’d die a virgin.”  
  
“Reed—”  
  
“No, seriously,” he interrupted. “You’ve been so against dating or even finding your mate, and here you are, living like you’re supposed to! I’m proud of you, Amber.”  
  
I couldn’t take it anymore. The guilt, the bond, the way his words twisted the knife already lodged in my chest—it was too much.  
  
""Can we not talk about this?"" I asked, turning to him with a forced smile. “What about you, huh? When are you planning to come out to everyone? You can’t keep hiding forever.”  
  
Reed froze, his playful grin faltering. For a moment, he looked startled, almost caught off guard by my question. Then his shoulders sagged, and he sighed, running a hand through his hair.  
  
“I… I don’t know,” he said quietly, his voice losing its usual bravado. “Amber, you know how things are in this Pack. People here don’t accept anything different. My dad? He’d disown me the second he found out. You’ve seen how narrow-minded he is about everything.”  
  
I crossed my arms, leaning slightly on one hip. “Yeah, but Reed, you can’t live your whole life in the closet. Someone’s going to figure it out eventually. Especially with how close you and Rayne are. People notice things.” I arched a brow. “The Alpha’s son sneaking you gifts every day isn’t exactly subtle.”  
  
Reed’s eyes widened slightly, and a flush crept up his cheeks. “He doesn’t sneak me gifts,” he muttered, clearly flustered.  
  
“Oh, really?” I teased, tilting my head. “What do you call the flowers he sends? The little trinkets? Don’t even get me started on that custom leather bracelet with the rune for ‘forever’ on it.”  
  
Reed pressed his lips together, his flush deepening. “Okay, fine,” he admitted. “Maybe he spoils me a little. But it’s not like anyone else notices. People think we’re just close friends.”  
  
“For now,” I said, my tone softening. “But how long can that last, Reed? Secrets have a way of coming out, especially when you care about someone as much as you care about him.”  
  
Reed’s face shifted, his usual sass replaced by something raw and vulnerable. He lowered his gaze, staring at the ground as if searching for answers.   
  
“I love him, Amber,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I love him so much it scares me. I don’t know what I’d do without him.” He looked up, his eyes glassy with emotion. “But if anyone finds out, we’re screwed. His dad would lose it. Rayne’s supposed to be the next Alpha of this Pack, and an Alpha doesn’t bond with a Beta. It won't matter to them that we love each other, I can't bear children.”  
  
I swallowed hard, the mention of Rayne’s name sending a jolt through the bond. His words twisted something in my chest, a sharp ache that was equal parts guilt and possessiveness. I wanted to sympathize with Reed, to tell him it would all be okay. But my wolf, Irma, had other ideas.  
  
He’s ours, she snarled, her voice a low, dangerous growl in my mind. Rayne belongs to us. Fight for him. Take what’s ours.  
  
I clenched my fists, trying to force Irma back, but the possessiveness bubbled under the surface, hot and insistent. My mate—our mate—was in love with someone else, and my wolf couldn’t stand it.  
  
I wanted to tell Reed the truth—to rip the bandage off and end this charade.  
  
My mouth opened, the words hovering on the edge of my tongue. Rayne is my mate.  
  
But then I saw the pain in Reed’s eyes, the fear of losing the person he loved.  
  
I couldn’t do it. I cared about him too much to hurt him like that.  
  
I closed my mouth, swallowing the truth and the guilt along with it. “Reed…” I started, then stopped. What could I say?  
  
He gave me a small, sad smile. “We’ll figure it out,” he said softly, as if trying to convince himself. “We have to.”  
  
My heart ached, torn between my bond with Rayne and my loyalty to Reed. But deep down, I knew it was only a matter of time before everything unraveled.  
  
How long could I keep this secret? How long before Reed found out that Rayne wasn’t just his boyfriend—he was my mate?  
  
And what would happen when he did?  
  


# Chapter 5

1684 WordsAmber  
  
It had been two weeks since that night—since Rayne had marked me, since our worlds had collided in the most painful and disastrous way imaginable.  
  
Two weeks since I had seen or heard from him.  
  
I told myself, at first, that he needed time. Anyone would. How could Rayne possibly come to terms with a mate bond, the betrayal it represented to Reed, and the weight of everything else all at once? But as the days stretched on in agonizing silence, the emptiness of his absence became unbearable.  
  
The bond wouldn’t let me forget him.  
  
It wasn’t just a mark. A mate bond was far more than a symbol of ownership or a claim. It was a tether—an indestructible, unyielding tie that linked our souls. Through it, I should have been able to sense his emotions, feel his heartbeat echoing alongside mine, and even hear his voice in my mind if either of us willed it. The bond should have let us soothe each other, even from afar, a connection so deep and intimate it defied explanation.  
  
But Rayne had slammed the door on his side of the bond.  
  
I could still feel the faint thrum of his existence, an ever-present vibration at the base of my neck. It reassured me that he was alive, that he was well—but that was all I got. No emotions, no connection, no whispers in the quiet of my mind.  
  
I’d heard of Alphas and Omegas closing their bonds before. It wasn’t common, but it wasn’t unheard of either. I had even asked one of the older Omegas at the shelter about it once, back when I was still curious and naive about mating. She’d said that closing the bond was a rejection in everything but name. A way of saying, I don’t want you.  
  
The thought alone felt like a knife twisting in my chest.  
  
Still, I could at least be grateful for one thing: Rayne hadn’t cheated.  
  
The bond made fidelity a cruel, unforgiving system. If he slept with someone else, the pain I would experience would be unimaginable. The bond would punish me for his infidelity, setting my body ablaze with searing fire. I had seen it happen once at the shelter—a young Omega writhing and screaming as her Alpha mate fooled around with someone else. The agony had lasted as long as the betrayal itself, leaving her trembling and broken for days after.  
  
The memory still haunted me.  
  
For Alphas, it was different. They could feel the same pain if their Omega cheated, but it was almost impossible for that to happen. Omegas were naturally submissive, biologically programmed to be docile and loyal. Once marked, they couldn’t feel pleasure from anyone but their bonded Alpha.  
  
But Alphas? They were free to do whatever they wanted. Even after bonding, they could fool around with anyone without consequence. It was a brutal imbalance, and one I hated with every fiber of my being.  
  
It was just another reason being an Omega felt like a curse.  
  
I sighed, my fingers brushing against the scent patch I’d placed over the mark. The ache in my chest wouldn’t go away, no matter how hard I tried to push it down. I knew I needed to see Rayne.  
  
We had so much to talk about.  
  
I hated that Rayne had this power over me, that even in his absence, the bond kept me tethered to him. I hated how my body craved him, how my instincts screamed for his touch.  
  
And yet, I couldn’t deny the truth.  
  
Lately, my instincts had been relentless, clawing at me day and night. I couldn’t sleep. I tossed and turned, drenched in sweat, my body trembling with a heat I couldn’t shake. My wolf, Irma, prowled in the back of my mind, restless and insistent.  
  
We need him, she would whisper. Our Alpha. His touch. His knot. His scent. Let us have him.  
  
It was unbearable. My skin felt too tight, my thoughts clouded with longing. I wanted him to scent me, to calm the storm raging inside me. I wanted to drown in his pheromones, to lose myself in his presence until the ache disappeared.  
  
But how could I face him when I didn’t even know where we stood?  
  
My thoughts were interrupted when something hit the back of my head. A crumpled piece of paper rolled across my desk.  
  
I didn’t bother turning around. I didn’t need to. It was one of my usual bullies, probably grinning to themselves at their clever little game.  
  
I took a deep breath, steadying myself. Six weeks, I reminded myself. Just six weeks until graduation. I could endure a little longer. Then I could leave this Pack, leave everything behind.  
  
The bell for break rang, and I stood up, trying to shake off the heaviness in my chest. My stomach churned with unease, but I ignored it, grabbing my bag and heading toward the cafeteria. It was just another day, another stretch of hours to endure until I could finally collapse in my silly excuse for a bed.  
  
But the moment the smell of food hit my nostrils, the nausea roared to life. The greasy, cloying aroma of cafeteria fries and overly seasoned pasta was overwhelming, clinging to the air like an invisible fog. My stomach turned violently.  
  
I barely made it to the bathroom in time.  
  
Hunched over the toilet, I retched, my body convulsing as I emptied what little was in my stomach. The acid burned my throat, tears stinging my eyes as the heaving finally subsided. My legs trembled as I leaned back, the tiled wall cool against my sweaty skin.  
  
What is wrong with me?  
  
Dragging myself to the sink, I turned on the tap and splashed cold water onto my face, rinsing my mouth to wash away the bitter taste. My hands gripped the edge of the sink, my knuckles white as I stared at my pale reflection in the cracked mirror.  
  
My heart was still racing, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I closed my eyes, trying to center myself, but the spinning in my head refused to stop.  
  
And then it hit me.  
  
My period.  
  
I opened my eyes, panic flickering across my face. My period was supposed to come three days ago.  
  
Dread crept in slowly, coiling in my stomach like a viper. I clenched the edge of the sink tighter, my mind racing to piece together the details, the mistakes.  
  
Rayne hadn’t used protection.  
  
I hadn’t been on birth control—I couldn’t even afford my suppressants half the time, let alone anything else.  
  
“How did I not think of this?” I whispered, my voice barely audible, trembling as the weight of realization settled over me.  
  
It was basic biology. Every Omega knew it: if an Alpha in rut mated with an Omega in heat, the chances of pregnancy weren’t just high—they were practically guaranteed.  
  
And yet, I’d been so consumed by everything else—by the betrayal, by the bond, by the constant guilt over Reed—that I hadn’t even considered the possibility.  
  
In the corner of my mind, Irma stirred.  
  
We’re pregnant, she said, her voice soft and triumphant. Our mate’s pup is inside us.  
  
“Shut up,” I muttered, pressing my palms against my temples. “This isn’t something to celebrate.”  
  
Why not? she growled, her tone laced with irritation. This is a gift, Amber. It’s his. It’s ours.  
  
I ignored her, forcing her voice into the background. My hands shook as I grabbed a paper towel, wiping my face and trying to steady myself.  
  
It’s probably nothing, I told myself. Just a random bout of nausea. Stress, maybe. That’s all.  
  
But the doubt wouldn’t leave. It lingered, heavy and suffocating, weighing down every thought, every breath.  
  
I somehow managed to get through the rest of my classes, though it felt like I was moving in a fog. The nausea faded, but the dread stayed, gnawing at me like a parasite.  
  
When the final bell rang, I didn’t wait for Reed like I usually did. I bolted out of the building, keeping my head down and my pace brisk as I made my way to the drugstore.  
  
The tiny shop felt oppressive, the fluorescent lights too bright, the rows of shelves too narrow. My hands were clammy as I picked up a box of pregnancy tests, shoving it into my bag as quickly as I could.  
  
The cashier gave me a curious glance, but I avoided eye contact, mumbling something about forgetting my wallet before rushing out the door.  
  
The walk back to the shelter felt like an eternity. Every step was filled with a growing sense of dread, the possibility clawing at my mind and refusing to let go. By the time I got to my room, my nerves were frayed to the breaking point.  
  
I locked the door behind me, ripped open the box, and stared at the instructions with trembling hands. Each second felt like an hour as I followed the steps, my heart pounding in my chest.  
  
When it was finally time, I stared at the result.  
  
Two pink lines.  
  
Pregnant.  
  
The word slammed into me like a freight train. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor, the test slipping from my fingers. My hand instinctively went to my stomach, trembling as I tried to process what this meant.  
  
Rayne’s pup.  
  
My mate’s pup.  
  
Irma practically purred in the back of my mind, her joy radiating through me. This is a blessing, she said. This is what we’re meant to be—a family.  
  
But I didn’t feel blessed. I felt like my entire world had just come crashing down.  
  
Tears burned in my eyes, and I pressed my forehead to my knees, curling into myself as the weight of it all threatened to suffocate me. How was I supposed to face Rayne now? How was I supposed to keep this a secret from Reed?  
  
How was I supposed to survive this?",1,1754498715.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

He's not getting the hint and is possibly autistic,"F27/M27 - Went on one hinge date over a month ago. The date was fun, conversation flowed but bottom line, i didn't feel chemistry and i walked away from the date knowing he wasn't a match.

When he tried to set up the next date I very politely, (clearly too politely,) told him i don't want to continue dating, but said i'm open to hang as just friends (I was just trying to sugar coat the rejection. and at the time I was going through a lonely time so i figured company wouldn't hurt since he made good conversation and seemed happy to take up my friendship offer.) But after hanging out once as ""friends"" I quickly realized I shouldn't even try to be friends with him - I went on hinge to find a romantic match, not force a friendship. 

He got pushy trying to find a time to see me again, so I sent a polite, yet firm text, saying I was quick to offer friendship, and I'm too busy to offer any more of my time. I wished him best of luck. (This was after 2 times of meeting in person.)

He sent a few snarky follow ups to that message, saying it's not that hard to just be friends. I ignored and he stopped contacting me for a few weeks. Until a few days ago when he asked me out for coffee. I ignored, (but i have my read receipts on so he can see I got the message.) 

Days later he followed up again asking how i've been. I ignored again. I feel like blocking him is too harsh. But at this point I'm wondering what message I can send him to be super clear, without being hurtful or mean - most importantly, I don't want to anger him, (he also mentioned on the date he has a short fuse.)

For context, one thing he mentioned on the date is he thinks he's autistic. He was never diagnosed, and I didn't see any of those qualities myself, but now I'm wondering if that's a factor as to why he's continuing to contact me and can't take a hint.

When we first got him, he was really easy to play with. Running around the coffee table, all sorts of flips, etc. He always had his preferred toys but he went nuts for them whenever we pulled them out.

As of 2-3 months ago, he has started batting/nipping at us, particularly my fiance. It doesn't seem mean, more playful, but it can be kinda scary and he has drawn blood with his claws. It feels like we're his prey when he does this. At the same time, he's dramatically less interested in the toys he used to love, and when we can get him to play it's only in really short bursts. He doesn't play until he's tired the way he used to. He is just as snuggly as ever.

Here is what I have tried:

* Lots and lots of new/different styles of toys. Not interested in any of them. He will play with his old favorites a little bit, but not for as long or as hard as he used to.
* Vet says he's in perfect health.
* Watching Jackson Galaxy videos on how to play with him; those tips didn't really make a difference.
* Ignoring him when he bats/nips instead of giving him attention/trying to play with him. This sort of worked for me and he nips at me less, but he still does it to my fiance.

Nothing particular changed in our apartment/lifestyle that I can pinpoint as the cause.

Any other advice? Do other people's cats do this and what worked for you? Do you think it might be because he and my fiance are both male? Is it gender-related? I would honestly just love to get him playing again.",1,1754498518.0,CatAdvice,1,1.0,False

1mj9mcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mj9mcq/might_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_be_the_braun/,Might the Best Drip Coffee Maker Be the Braun BrewSense KF6050WH,"The Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker has been a recent addition to my kitchen, and let me tell you, it’s been an intriguing experience testing it out. The name ""BrewSense"" alone evokes the promise of a perfectly curated cup of coffee, and for the most part, it delivers on that promise. However, like any product, it’s not without its quirks. Here’s what I discovered while using it daily.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the minimalist white finish of this coffee maker caught my eye. It has a compact design, which means I didn’t have to sacrifice precious counter space in my already crowded kitchen. Despite its smaller footprint, the overall height is a bit taller than I expected, so those with low-hanging cabinets might need to consider the placement carefully. The brushed stainless steel accents give it a modern and high-end look, blending seamlessly into both contemporary and traditional kitchen styles. The cord storage feature is one of those little details that I truly appreciated; no dangling cables cluttering the workspace made my typically chaotic mornings feel just a pinch more organized.

**Features that Stand Out**  
This coffee maker has some nifty features that aren’t just gimmicks but genuinely enhanced my coffee-making experience. The programmable 24-hour timer is a game-changer for anyone like me who despises bleary-eyed coffee prep in the morning. The auto shutoff feature came in handy when I inevitably forgot I had the machine running. Add to that the brew pause system—this allowed me to selfishly sneak a cup midway through the brewing process without creating a drippy, frustrating mess.

**Flavor and Aroma**  
The taste of the coffee this machine produces is one of its biggest wins. Braun’s Pure Flavor Technology ensures that every brew hits the right temperature and extraction time, which makes every cup feel fresh and consistent. The 12-cup flavor carafe seals in the aroma, and honestly, I could smell the coffee well before I sipped it, which is half the experience for me. I also tested the machine’s 1-4 cup setting since I didn’t always need an entire pot, and I was delighted to find that the taste and flavor held up even with smaller portions.

[Find the best price for Braun KF6050WH on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b07cpjf2bg/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
The control panel is straightforward, with buttons that are easy to press and an LED display that's clearly visible—even when I was fumbling with it pre-caffeine. The water level indicator is thoughtfully placed, allowing for precision whether I’m brewing a single mug or a full 12-cup carafe. Cleaning the machine is also fairly intuitive, thanks to the “clean” warning that lights up when it’s time to descale. One of the more premium features, the gold-tone filter, not only enhances the flavor but also reduces the hassle of continually stocking up on paper filters. However, cleaning the gold filter occasionally took a little elbow grease to get rid of trapped coffee oils.

**Perks**  
- The programmable timer ensures hot coffee is ready the moment you wake up.  
- Gold-tone filter improves the taste while being environmentally friendly.  
- Compact design saves counter space but still feels sturdy.  
- Brew pause system makes mid-brew coffee access drip-free and seamless.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite its sleek design and impressive features, there were a few elements that could use some attention.  
- The taller height might not fit seamlessly under low kitchen cabinets.  
- The carafe, while designed to seal in flavor, is a bit tricky to clean thoroughly.  
- I noticed that fine coffee grounds occasionally bypassed the filter, leaving slight residue in the cup.  

**Product Rivals**  
Over time, I’ve used coffee makers from Cuisinart and Breville, both of which have their strengths. Compared to them, Braun KF6050WH holds its own impressively when it comes to flavor consistency and modern design. That said, the Breville options tend to have more advanced brewing features for those who are deeply into coffee experimentation. On the other hand, Braun’s build is more durable than some recent Cuisinart models I’ve owned, where plastic parts started cracking after a year of use. In short, Braun strikes a good balance, excelling in delivering simplicity and reliability.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
While I wouldn’t classify this coffee maker as ""budget,"" it doesn’t feel overpriced for what it offers. The materials feel durable, the design is premium, and the coffee flavor is, in a word, fantastic. Are there cheaper options on the market? Definitely. Yet, it’s rare to find one that aligns this well with aesthetics, functionality, and flavor potential. The only thing to weigh is whether you’ll make full use of all its features or if a more basic coffee maker could cover your needs at a lower price point.

She doesnt enjoy cooking or cleaning, so i figured it'd be best if i step into those roles so we can eat less takeout and a more healthy diet. The kids eat breakfast and lunch at school and when they go to school she typically goes to the gym, yoga, then goes for coffee, browses social media, then shopping or window shopping, or goes and does her hair, nails, eyebrows, eyelashes, makeup, etc then comes home to cook dinner. 

I brought it up as gently as I could, but she still called me ungrateful and accused me of ""not appreciating all the hard work she does in the house."" Now there's tension and she's acting cold towards me.

Sorry if my English is weird, it's not my native language. I have been isolating because seeing people is hard in this state.

Bella stood in the shower in the Luna’s suite, allowing the warm water to wash over her. She was pleasantly exhausted, Parker had left her suite; he was off to a mating ball in another state. She had four days now, where he wasn’t going to be there inside the pack.  
  
She was his Luna; had been for eight years now, but she was bound to him not by her choice, had been chosen for him by her own Alpha and Luna; just to get rid of her, and she knew it.  
  
She was the youngest child of her father, and unwanted and shunned; a bastard child not born of his Mate bond, and that was why she was hated by the Luna in her home pack.   
  
This allianced mating, that she’d been bound to at just 19 years of age. It was, she believed, her father’s Luna’s way of getting rid of her from their pack, once and for all. The only solace she had was that there was a detailed mating alliance. That did not allow for Parker to bring harm to her.  
  
Parker came to her room, the Luna’s suite every other night to bed her, and though the s\*x was good, more than good, damned near on amazing at times, she had to admit, because he wasn’t just a man that came and took what he wanted.  
  
No, he was a man that enjoyed s\*x, enjoyed knowing he pleased the woman in his bed, even if she had been sold to him. Parker could spend hours in her bed, touching and tasting her, sometimes all night long. He was not a terrible Mate to her, but he was indifferent most of the time.  
  
She had been given to him to stop a war between their two packs, had been Marked and Mated by him, taken as his Chosen Luna, with full view of rejecting her one-day down the line. She didn’t actually mean anything to him.  
  
He didn’t love her, and she didn’t love him. She could enjoy him being in her bed because of the Mate Bond, enjoyed it a lot, and had been known to scream with pleasure at him having his way with her. He could be utterly insatiable at times, and a part of Bella craved him; as his Mate she loved his every touch. She actually enjoyed her heat when it came, just once a year, spent seven glorious days being mated by him, and the s\*x; all rough I’ve just got to have alpha-blooded needs on the surface.   
  
Screamed in utter bliss that week multiple times a day and half all night, but it was the only time he never got out of her bed and slept in his suite.  
  
Every time always ended the same way. The moment he couldn’t scent her heat anymore, he was up and gone from her suite. Eight years of it; nothing had changed for him. Just three days ago, her heat had ended, and he’d left in the middle of the night. She’d not even known, she had been exhausted by them mating furiously that last time, and she had slept like the dead. Then she'd woken up on her own because her heat was over.  
  
This morning, him in her bed for a few hours before the sun rose. It was because he was going away for a mating ball and would be gone for four days. The pack he was visiting was in another state, 12 hours away, unaffiliated to him but a good opportunity for his wolves to pair up.  
  
There was nothing unusual about him being gone for four days, seeing as how far away that pack was, sometimes it was five full days. That was nice for her, he wasn’t one to tax his wolves, and so they stopped overnight on the way there or back if necessary. Not that he informed her of his doings, she just learned it over the years.   
  
Parker didn’t think that he was required to tell her his movements, she was only his Mate and Luna, due to the mating alliance that they had. It didn’t bother her at all, it just meant she had four days to herself this week. He always liked to have s\*x before he left and when he got back as well, something about he had an alpha-blooded s\*x drive that he needed to sate on a regular basis.  
  
She didn’t argue about it, she had it too, there was no need to either, they both got all the tingly mate bond goodness in that bed of hers. And it was always in her bed. She’d never even seen inside the Alpha Suite; that was not a place for her to be.  
  
Bella dressed for the day and headed downstairs, to get herself some breakfast, where she saw him and his unit all heading across the foyer and out the front door of the packhouse to leave. He nodded to her, but never said goodbye to her. No one here thought anything about it, they all knew she had been given to him. Was not his Goddess-Gifted Mate.  
  
Though the pack here was nice to her, they didn’t treat her badly at all, that had been a surprise to her, and she herself was nice to all of them. She actually liked the pack, and it seemed the pack actually liked her. Looked to her for advice even. She did her Luna duties as was required of her.  
  
She had been sent here against her will, but actually found that she fitted in better inside this pack than her own home pack. She had respect here from this pack, from Parker to a certain degree, she thought.   
  
She’d learned how to be a Luna to this pack, and attended to all of those duties that Parker had tasked her with, when she’d first been brought here. She had even been allowed to study with his pack’s doctor in the hospital, and now, eight years later she herself was a good doctor.  
  
Bella specialized in the delivery of pups, and looking after the she-wolves in labour, using her Luna Calm to help them settle when fully distressed, and things got a bit on the hairy side. She’d not lost a single pup or she-wolf in the past eight years of assisting and then delivering on her own.  
  
She was a fully registered doctor with this pack, and one day when she left, she would be a doctor for another pack somewhere else. That was the goal. Though what the really crazy thing was, was that six months after she went into heat herself, there was always an explosion of pups within the pack.  
  
It hadn’t gone unnoticed by the pack's doctor, her mentor Annette, she shook her head and had stated “It’s you, you know.” They often laughed and joked about it. Annette had already chuckled just yesterday about getting supplies ready for pups to be born in a few months’ time.  
  
Bella had just snorted and shaken her own head, they were currently going through that now, that heat she’d had last week was completely unexpected and out of the blue, her second one for this year. Had not been expected at all.   
  
Annette’s theory only made Bella shake her head, she thought it was just a coincidence was all. She’d not gotten pregnant once in the past eight years of having a heat once a year.  
  
A part of her was glad of it as well, knowing that there was a clause in her mating alliance that stated all pups she had while still bonded to Parker, were to be given to him. When he found his Goddess-Gifted Mate and rejected her, she had to leave them behind for him to raise. They were his heirs. It was not something she wanted to happen.  
  
She knew that Parker would make her give them up as well. He followed all his alliance dealings to the letter. She also knew it was a clause he’d written into their mating alliance himself. He wasn’t willing to relinquish any child to her, he would be claiming all of them as his heirs. She might be their mother if she ever birthed any pups, but she had no rights to them; that was how she looked at that clause.  
  
She saw him sometimes looking at her, in the weeks after her heat, assessing her, she knew, listening for a heartbeat of a pup. He wanted an heir and she, being Alpha-blooded like he was, their pup would be a pure-blooded heir for this pack. There were no pups, even though she wasn’t on birth control of any kind, he wouldn’t allow it. He was hoping for a pup between them and she knew it.

Bella thought there was no pup simply because she didn’t want one and her wolf certainly didn’t want one to a Mate that was not her Fated or that was how it felt to Bella. Neither of them were at all interested in having a pup with a Mate that was going to, at some point in time, whether it be in the near or far future, reject them for his Goddess-Gifted when she came along.   
  
Why would anyone want to do that when they knew that their Alpha Mate would be sending them away, pretty much just tossing them out of his pack and without their pups, making them sever their kind bond to however many pups they had and loved. No she-wolf she knew would agree with that, it was insane; and neither she nor Freya, her wolf, were interested in that happening to them.  
  
Parker had made a few comments over the years about it, and she’d stared at him, stated simply, “Maybe, Selena doesn’t want us to have a pup, Parker.”  
  
To which he’d retort, “And maybe you’re infertile.” Sounding a bit on the angry side about it.  
  
“Could well be,” she’d nodded at him simply. She’d not taken offense to his words.   
  
Though she wasn’t infertile. She’d been tested a few years back along with himself after that very comment. She’d thought he’d gone away and thought about his own words, and maybe come to the conclusion that one of them was infertile.  
  
So they’d both been tested at his request, and they were both fine and capable of conceiving a pup, apparently. It just wasn’t meant to be as far as she was concerned, and she was honestly glad of it.  
  
Though during her heats, Parker knotted her every time he came, and she him back, liked the bloody feeling of it as much as he did, and she knew it. She understood that being knotted to one's Mate kind of made you feel whole, that it was part of the mate bond as well.  
  
He had in fact knotted her this morning, had looked right down at her while still knotted to her and sighed softly, contentedly. She knew he liked the feeling of being knotted to her. All wolves did unless they weren’t their Mate.  
  
His blue eyes had looked into her blue ones, and he’d murmured softly as he’d looked down at her, a gentle smile on his face, “An heir would be nice, don’t you think Belladonna.” He hadn’t said it in months, and she’d been a little surprised to hear him bring it once more, she had thought he’d give up on that thought, though the way he said her name softly, almost sounded like he cared at that moment. She knew better though, he never shortened her name like everyone else inside the pack did. He was the only one to call her Belladonna, and she was certain that he did it, to remind himself she was his Chosen Mate.   
  
“I guess it would.” She’d answered him. It was all she ever said on the subject of a pup between them.   
  
She’d only ever actually said ‘no’ once, and it had set him and his beast off into a fit of rage. She’d not really understood that. He didn’t love her, she knew that. But she’d never dared to say it again. Because his anger over her declining to even think it was a good idea, had filtered into the pack.  
  
The pack had been on edge over his foul mood, and she’d seen him stomping around and grating out orders at everyone. He’d been cranky about it for over a week. So now she stated she guessed it would be, instead of telling him no she didn’t want one with him. To save the pack from his temper was all, something he had, but she rarely saw, the pack rarely saw, and she had a feeling he tried not to lose it for no reason at all. The pack did like him, respect him and were happy with him as their Alpha.  
  
Sometimes she wondered what that war with her home pack had been all about. She didn’t recall there being a war, perse, there had been a full threat of one, that much she did know. Though her father and Parker had probably not wanted that war and tried everything to stop it before it got started. She’d not been privy to that and during those two days everyone had been sequestered to their homes. Though she did know there had been a wolfen force at the border of the pack.   
  
She shook off her thoughts, she didn’t need a trip down memory lane, that was a long time ago. She ate her breakfast in the dining room as she always did, smiled at the wolves in here eating as well. Chuckled as a boy of six climbed up onto the seat next to her and tugged on her arm “Luna, mummy’s going to have her baby today.”  
  
“Is she now?” she’d smiled down at him.  
  
“Yes, daddy took her to the hospital just a minute ago.”  
  
Bella smiled at him “Are you excited to meet your little sister Franky?” she asked him.  
  
“Yes.” He smiled big up at her “Aunty Becky is watching me.”  
  
Bella looked up to find Rebekah his aunt walking this way. She was heavily pregnant herself. “Daisy just went into labour, Luna.” Rebekah told her as she walked over to her.  
  
“I just heard; Franky’s excited.” She ruffled his blond hair. “How are you doing today, Becky?”  
  
“Alright, will you be going to the hospital soon?” Becky asked.  
  
“Yes, right after breakfast. Everything will be fine with your sister; I’ve not lost a pup yet and am not about to start today.” She reassured Becky.  
  
Bella had gone into heat six months ago. This was going to be a busy week here inside the pack. Her last heat had been very unexpected. Had come in the middle of the night, out of nowhere and Parker had not been in the pack for it either. That first night had been agony locked in her suite, unable to sate the needs from her heat.  
  
But he’d come back in short order, when he’d been informed she was in heat, and she’d been on him the moment he’d walked into her suite, practically ripped his pants off him and shoved him down all alpha aggression, and she ridden the hell out of him with all she’d had right by the suites' entry door.  
  
He hadn’t cared, had enjoyed it himself, enjoyed all her heats while they lasted. He got to have s\*x for hours every day and half the nights as well, it was all rough and raw, both their alpha-blooded needs in full swing. They were both very aggressive about getting what they wanted during her heats. It was kind of unavoidable, she thought. Just their bloodlines.  
  
She pulled herself from her thoughts and made her way to the pack’s hospital, pulled on her scrubs. Today she was wearing soft blue scrubs with sloths all over them; she thought they were cute.  
  
The pack hospital had, had a uniform when she’d arrived in this pack, black scrubs, she’d gotten rid of them, thought they were very unfriendly, and some of the pack’s children who’d never been in the hospital before had shied away from the nurses and doctors on their first visit.  
  
Now all the nurses and doctors wore fun scrubs with patterns all over them, some even tailored them to the seasons. It had helped the children relax and be comfortable. They did have a standard uniform for after war or pack attacks, when their wolves were grieving the loss of loved ones. Simple respectful scrubs that were mint green and white.  
  
Despite being brought here as a Chosen Mate and Luna, Parker did expect her to attend all Luna duties, and she did them well. He couldn’t fault her on that. He didn’t have any complaints, and had actually told her she made a good Luna to his pack.   
  
That had been just a few years back. She’d just smiled and nodded, accepted the compliment from him, they were few and far between, had told him in return, “I like the pack members, they’re nice to me.” and they were. ""I'll always do my best for them, Parker.""  
  
The Lustrous Moon was a much nicer pack to her than her home pack had been.

It was a long four days inside the pack. Bella had delivered 17 pups over those days, she had lived inside the pack hospital itself, slept in her office, on the couch in there so she didn’t have to make the trip from the Luna suite to the hospital, which took 20 minutes at a casual stroll, it was closer to the pack's town than the packhouse, and she understood that was because it had been built to cater to the majority of the pack who lived in the town not the packhouse.  
  
Parker was due home today around lunchtime, and she knew that the moment he was finished initiating his new pack members into his pack, and allocating them homes if they needed it, he was going to want to go right to her room and have s\*x.   
  
He couldn’t go more than two days without s\*x on any normal given week here inside the pack. With the exception of that one week, he'd been angry. He'd stayed away from her that week; not brought his anger into her bed. But when he had crawled into bed, Goddess she'd never thought he was going to stop eating her out. Gotten multiples from him, several in fact, before she fallen asleep and woke up alone.  
  
This was how it had been for the past eight years. She, however, was actually very tired today, exhausted, she would say, had pulled an all-nighter last night and had yet to get any sleep. Bella had delivered three pups in the past 7 hours, and Annette had delivered two herself.  
  
Bella had received a text from him just as she was sitting down at her desk in her Luna's office, “I’ll be home in a few hours.” It had read. Bella had frowned down at it, a little confused as to why he’d sent it. He’d never done that before.  
  
She shook it off, likely he was just letting her know that he expected them to get naked in her bed when he got home, because he wanted to have s\*x. It had been four days. Well, it wasn’t going to be like that today. She had many things to do this morning herself and was too tired for s\*x; he’d have to understand.  
  
She was in all likelihood going to be in the Luna’s office when he crossed the pack border as well, because she had to now sit down and register all of those pups with the pack. Get their parents' files all up to date as well; having to register all 17 pups took time, and she didn’t make mistakes.  
  
It was going to be a long day, and she’d probably sleep like the dead after Parker had his way with her at some point later in the afternoon. She sighed as she sat in her chair, staring at the computer screen in front of her, her eyes kept drooping and she micro napped a few times, was fighting off sleep that she desperately needed and she knew it.  
  
She got up and looked at the time. It was just on 8am. She could sleep for two hours and then pull on her alpha-bloodline after that, to get her through the rest of the day, until she turned in for the night, she would go to bed early and she knew it. She set herself an alarm on her phone and crashed out on the couch in the Luna's office.  
  
Woke up and stretched and got coffee, when her alarm went off, she was still tired but could function at least. Returned to her job of documenting the births of those pups, and the condition of the mothers. She hissed as pain shot through her left arm, almost felt like someone had stabbed her and dragged a knife up her arm. It only lasted a few seconds, and she rubbed her arm and shook it off. It was odd, to say the least. Never felt that happen before.  
  
She finished documenting those pups, attached their baby pictures to the files and smiled at each one of them, she did love babies, they were so cute. All her life she’d been in a pack hospital. Her mother had died in childbirth, and she’d been raised by her grandmother, a nurse in her home pack, she’d never really had any friends, not being that she was her father’s bastard daughter, not even her half siblings liked her.  
  
Bella had learned to stick close to her grandmother, and she herself had worked in the pack hospital from a young age, become a runner for those that worked there, dashing off to get things they needed.   
  
Then she had started working in the hospital at 16, had dropped out of school altogether. It was not fun for her in that school, she got bullied by her half siblings all day long. She’d had one a few months older than she was, and she was in all her classes.  
  
Her father had not cared that she’d dropped out of school at all, he’d also never sent her off to Alpha College, she wasn’t a legitimate heir so didn’t need to go. She’d never asked to go either. She never went into the packhouse for anything, just tried to be invisible to that pack.  
  
Her father may have claimed her as his kin, but she was not part of the Alpha’s family, though she didn’t think Parker knew that. She was in fact hated by all of her siblings; the Luna especially hated her existence. Bella kind of understood that. She’d learned at a young age her conception had seen the packs Luna be in agony with the pains of betrayal.  
  
Though her grandmother had told her once, it wasn’t as it seemed, and not to believe that her mother was a mistress, she’d not been, hadn’t wanted to be bedded by her father, the alpha of that pack. She’d hadn’t had a choice about it, but then in the next breath she’d stated don’t blame your father either, he didn’t really want to bed your mother. It had confused her a lot. If neither had wanted it, how had it happened?   
  
Bella pulled herself from her thoughts as her tummy rumbled, and she got up to go and have lunch. It was midday and Parker wasn’t back yet, though she didn’t think it would be far off at all. He’d text her at 7am, a few hours. She shrugged, likely they’d all stopped for food somewhere.  
  
She was just returning to her office when she felt him come back into the pack, and he mind-linked to her near instantly, “Belladonna, meet me in the foyer.” He stated and cut the link before she could even reply to him.  
  
She was actually in the foyer now, so took up a seat with some of the pack’s kids and watched them play a board game. They all smiled up at her, and she smiled back at them, helped that youngest one out a bit.  
  
She looked up as Parker walked into the packhouse, and there was a woman walking next to him, quite tall, almost as tall as he was, though Bella noted she was wearing stilettos, they clicked loudly on the tiled floor as she strode along next to Parker. She looked more than annoyed to Bella.  
  
Bella stood as was expected of her to greet him when he came home, and watched as the woman looked right at her now as well, then there was just anger in those eyes of hers. Bella saw her take a full step closer to Parker and try to reach out and curl her hand around his forearm. Parker frowned down at her and brushed it away. “I’ve explained this to you Carina,” he stated flatly “No touching at this time.”  
  
There was more anger welling off the she-wolf now, and Bella understood right away, Parker had found his Goddess-Gifted Mate at that mating ball and though he would want to claim her for himself. He couldn’t, not until he’d rejected Bella. It was part of their mating alliance.  
  
“Axel, please take Carina to get some lunch.” Parker addressed his Delta, and motioned for them to move on passed him. His eyes moved back to her after Axel walked Carina off, “Belladonna, my office please.” He stated casually, and turned and walked that way himself.  
  
“Yes, Parker.” She answered him simply, she knew what this was all about, it was time for him to reject her, so he could go and claim his actual mate.

She wondered just how much he was struggling right this minute, not being able to claim his Goddess-Gifted. How much had he struggled on the full moon when scenting her out and then coming face to face with her?   
  
Scenting her out knowing he couldn’t claim her, having that she-wolf see that he was already marked and mated by another, Bella bet that woman, Carina, she’d heard her name was, had been very confused by that. Likely been very angry about it, from what she’d just seen, clearly she hadn’t liked it at all.   
  
Ah! That stabbing pain in her arm earlier in the day, it was likely Carina had touched Parker, and as brief as it had been, she’d felt it, that had been pains of betrayal.   
  
That full moon night wouldn’t have been fun for her, and then the overnight stay in a hotel, and the long drive here to the pack. That she-wolf was more than ticked off about not being able to claim what was hers, but Parker, she knew, was a stickler for the rules.  
  
Which was a good thing for her, otherwise he could have treated her terribly over the years, and he could have marked and mated that she-wolf on the full moon, if he wasn’t a man of his word; something that she knew he actually was, and she was thankful for, because it would likely have killed her if he’d done that.  
  
She excused herself from the children and headed into his office, followed his Beta and Gamma. She heard the door being closed by Kane, the pack Beta. “Congratulations, Parker.” She smiled, genuinely happy for him. “I see you found your Goddess-Gifted Mate.”  
  
He nodded to her, “I have.” He stated as he sat down behind his desk “so we need to talk, you and I.” He looked right at her now.  
  
“Why?” she asked right back “I know what this is, I was chosen, just to be rejected by you.” she knew that was the truth, wondered if her old Luna wanted her to know that and feel it. Punish her for being born by doing this to her. “Just reject me Parker, I’ll accept it.” she told him simply.  
  
She had basically been sold to the Alpha sitting before her, she didn’t love him, her wolf didn’t love his either, their bond had never grown and flourished like all others did. It never would, or she didn’t believe that it would. The only time they spent together was in her bed, when he wanted to have s\*x, or she was in heat.  
  
Never did they ever go out for a meal, never had they celebrated their mate bond with each other, she’d not even gotten a Luna Ceremony. She had been announced to the pack the morning after he’d marked and mated her and that was it. She was not his Goddess-Gifted, and only that woman would get all of him, all the things that came with being his true Luna.  
  
Parker was frowning at her now, almost with disapproval in those blue eyes of his. He was still sitting there just staring at her, did so for a full minute as though he expected some sort of outburst from her, she thought. She wasn’t going to do that, wasn’t about to pitch a fit or kick up any kind of fuss over this.  
  
She stood there and stared right back at him, didn’t really understand why he didn’t just issue that rejection instantly, it was why he’d called her into his office, and she knew it, because he’d brought his Goddess-Gifted home with him. Bella finally raised an eyebrow at him, when he just sat there and continued to stare at her and say nothing. She shook her head a little, “I’ll do it then.” She stated simply, “I Luna Belladonna Harrington, reject you Alpha Parker Hartly as my Mate.” She stated, he’d never given her his name, again something reserved for his Goddess-Gifted Mate only, as was the Alpha Suite.  
  
She’d been here eight long years, and the entire time she’d resided in the Luna Suite, again a clause in the mating alliance; put in by Parker himself, she thought. To make sure she understood her place inside this pack, she supposed.   
  
She was his Luna and f\*\*k buddy, not the love of his life. She doubted that he had any feelings at all where she was concerned, had wondered at times if he even liked her as a person. They didn’t talk often, so she wouldn’t know.  
  
Bella felt the severing of the bond begin on her end and gritted her teeth against it, stood staring at his widened eyes at her sudden rejecting of him. Almost like he couldn’t believe she’d issued it at all, “Accept it.” she gasped out after 30 seconds of him just staring at her “It, hurts Parker. Get it over with, please.”  
  
Again, there was that frown on his face, though now it was deepened, then he just stood up and nodded at her, “I Alpha Parker Hartly, accept your rejection Belladonna Harrington, you are no longer my Mate and Luna.”  
  
Bella gasped as their bond severed completely, clutched at her chest as she felt him being ripped away from her. Freya's snarl echoed inside her mind at the pain she was feeling. Then there was a pair of hands on her shoulders as she started to buckle under the weight of the pain.  
  
She could feel Shannon, the pack’s Gamma, rolling his charm over her to help ease her pain, and she was actually glad that he was there right this very minute. It hurt like a b\*\*\*h, more than she had thought it would, considering their bond was nothing more than just really good s\*x. There was no emotional attachment between them, so she'd not expected it to hurt so much.  
  
She sank down onto her knees and had to breathe through the feeling of Parkers Mark burning off her neck. It took several long agonizing minutes, and even Shannon's Charm wasn't really helping with the pain of it, though she could feel it being rolled over her the whole time. Her hand reached up to touch her neck instinctively when the mark was gone, no more was the filigree that had adorned her neck for the past eight years, there were just two puncture marks where his fangs had buried into her that first night he’d brought her here to his pack and claimed her.  
  
It was no longer sensitive to the touch either, she felt nothing as she touched it where once it had brought desire. Even when she touched it herself, nothing remained right this minute.  
  
Her eyes lifted to him, he had a hand tightly gripped onto the edge of his desk, and a fist pressed hard against his chest. He looked to be in as much pain as she was. His eyes were on hers, never left hers at all, not even when she stood herself up and gently removed Shannon’s hands from her, stating softly “I’ll be alright, Shannon. Thank you.” and she knew she would be.  
  
“Parker, you should go and claim your Goddess-Gifted, it will resolve your pain quickly.”  
  
“And you?” he asked, and it almost sounded to her that he was concerned about her.  
  
“I’ll be fine. I understand our mating alliance, and I will follow it to the letter. Kane and I can sort that out. You should go and be with your Mate. She’ll be happy we’re over, and you can claim her, she can finally claim what is hers rightfully by the Goddess.”  
  
He was frowning at her now, didn’t appear to understand her reaction to all of this. But she was finally free, released from the contract that had made her just one of his belongings. It’s all she was to him, something he owned. Now she wasn’t his anymore or wouldn’t be in 24 hours; that’s how long she had to leave this pack.  
  
She turned to Kane, the pack’s Beta. “If you could meet me in the foyer in say an hour, we’ll finish it off properly, while Parker is marking and mating his Goddess-Gifted Mate.”  
  
“Yes Lu… Bella.” He nodded, had almost called her Luna, like he had done so many times before, over the past eight years.
