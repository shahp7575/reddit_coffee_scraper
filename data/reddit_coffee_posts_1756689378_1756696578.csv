I can't find this Otome,"*Okay, so I'm new to Reddit, and I'm not sure how this works however, I really need help. There is this Otome game that I used to play, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. I don't know the name, but here are things I do know. First, I'm not sure if the love interests were coffee or if their names were based on coffee, but one of their names was like Mocha or something. Second, they were not human; they were like aliens because I got one of the endings where they had to return home. Also, it's not the game Cafe Enchante, that's a Switch game; this game I got on my phone from the App Store. But the game, I believe, mostly took place in a cafe, and I think there were around 4 to 5 possible love interests.* ",1,1756696188.0,otome,0,1.0,False

Hey there! I've never been the best at these but if I'm calling myself a writer, I can't exactly back down from this!

I'm a 29 year old artist, writer, avid hiker, and current masters student for Higher Education Leadership; my end game is to be some sort of executive type at a university and go to WAR for my educators and students against the awful, anti-intellectualism nonsense going on right now, ensuring they get what they need and my school fricking rocks. I want to write and make good art that encourages people to engage with their lives and their imaginations.

I also very much want to find the black cat to my golden retriever! I managed to get through all of my twenties without that, but now I think I want to build a life with someone that we can grow in and make our own. Tell me about your dreams, your hopes, what you dislike and like; what's your favorite meal? I'll bet you I can learn how to make it exactly the way you like (but if it's like, fugu, maybe I shouldn't? Don't ask the nuerospicy, untrained home cook to prepare the tetrodotoxin)

I can't guess what anyone's dynamic would be like, so I'll just list off some of the things that get me up in the morning : Coffee -- okay that's it. For things I like, writing, anime and animations, Pokemon, art, museums, aquariums, martial arts, hiking and strength training, being crafty and DIYs, new and good food, cooking, music (I've been enjoying metal lately, but also lofi - I contain multitudes) cultures from the world over, trail running (haven't been in forever) and being near the water. There's definitely more but, you've got things to do, I'll tell you about the rest as it comes up or over that boba I lured you in with.

That's it for now methinks <3 Thanks for reading and, I hope we get to chat soon!

1n5dpxk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5dpxk,First Brisket,"I finally decided to go in the deep end in the pool of smoking meat, by smoking a brisket. I cooked it on a Weber Kettle, with post oak/charcoal (I also have an Only Fire ceramic insert that I used) Family gave it solid reviews, but I think there’s definitely room for improvement, flavor wise. When I try again, I definitely want to season the meat heavier. I made up a seasoning mix of kosher salt, pepper, granulated garlic, granulated onion, and celery seed, that went on all sides. I then went over the fat cap with a coffee based run I found at Aldi. I used Holy Cow on the other side. 

My process was to season the meat the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I put it on the smoker at 9:30. I used a #6 cast iron pan as a water pan. Temps started out low around 200, and then they jumped to 300 (they stayed between 275-300 the entire cook). I think next time I’ll cut down the post oak sticks, into chunks to better control the temps. I spritzed it when it hit 100 degrees (idk why, I just figured that was a good temp to spritz it). I wrapped it around 1:30am in butcher paper and talo. It hit 200 around 3am and I let it rest in the oven at 170 until 4pm when we ate dinner. 

Things I would do differently. Other than seasoning more and adjusting the size of the wood chunks, I think I would use a foil boat (along with the butcher paper). The paper ripped a little when I was trying to take the brisket off the grill, spilling some of the fat into the grill. Does anyone else use both, or is that a bad idea? Best part about the whole experience, is my kid asked me if he could stay up with me, while I smoked the brisket. He made it til about 2am before he tapped out. I made sure he got the first slice for hanging out with the old man. ",3,1756696065.0,brisket,0,1.0,False

Due to the timeline and also my personal bandwidth at the moment, I can’t do a ton of back-and-forth and rescheduling. I can’t let anyone claim something unless they’re actively on their way. I’m so sorry!!! Just being real!! I do have 2 cats but they are indoor and most of this was sitting in a storage closet. Non-Smoking household!

1.) Crash Pad for sensory-seeking kids. My kiddo didn’t like that the foam inside was in cubes, so hopefully another fan can use it! My guess is it’s around 4’ x 3’.

2.) This is just a really heavily used box for stuff. There’s no shelving or organizers inside, just a SUPER sturdy but ragged tool box I moved on from. Will need a wipe down inside! 

3.) Pull ups for slightly older kids. This is a mix of “Sleepovers” Brand pull ups (unisex, plain white, pretty soft!) I have 6-7 packets of these, then a bunch of Ninjamas in size M-L my son is 8 and around 65-70 lbs for reference. They would fit someone who was 5-6 probably too though. Also a little stack of Bluey 6T pull-ups. 

4.) Two framed abstract pieces of wall art from Target. It was a set of 3, one broke. Idk the size but not huge not tiny? 

5.) Unopened Squatty potty. Get your excellent poop game on. 

6.) Motor oil. Both are full-ish. 

7.)Weight Gurus scale, this this connects with your phone so you can diversify the ways it ruins your body image daily! Takes 3x AAA batteries and is missing the battery cover. The batteries do fine staying in on their own but you could throw a piece of tape over the openings if you are fancy. 

8.) 7x10 checkered ivory/beige rug. It was rolled out in my living room for about three weeks. It’s a great rug, but in the end I decided checkers were too busy for my house. I did drop a smidge of iced coffee on it, but it landed on one of the beige spots and honestly, you just can’t tell. 

9.) hanging cuddle swing for sensory seekers or autistic kiddos. This isn’t the exact one but it’s very close.  Can be hung from the ceiling, but also up for grabs is a kit to hang it from your door frame. 

10.) two different 2 pieces sets of light filtering linen-type Terra Cotta/Clay tab top curtains, the measurements should be in the pic. They are slightly different shades, the ones that are a zoomed in pic are a bit darker

## What Does It Really Mean to Be a Grown-Up? 🤔

We all know someone who's technically an adult but acts like they're still figuring out how to tie their shoes. Age doesn't automatically grant wisdom, and having a mortgage doesn't make you mature. True maturity is something entirely different – it's about how we think, react, and navigate the messy reality of everyday life.

Real maturity shows up in the small moments: when your colleague takes credit for your idea, when your neighbor's dog keeps you awake at night, or when your favorite restaurant gets your order completely wrong. It's in these ordinary situations that we discover whether we've truly grown up or if we're still throwing invisible tantrums.

## Breaking Free from Black-and-White Thinking 🎨

One of the biggest signs of emotional growth is learning to see the world in full color instead of just black and white. When we're young (or emotionally young), everything feels absolute. People are either completely good or entirely evil. Decisions are either perfect or disasters. Political parties are either saints or devils.

But reality is far more nuanced. Your boss might be brilliant at strategy but terrible at communication. Your best friend could be incredibly loyal yet chronically unreliable. That restaurant you love might have amazing food but awful service. Learning to hold these contradictions without your brain short-circuiting is a superpower worth developing.

**Daily Practice:** Next time you catch yourself thinking ""always"" or ""never"" about someone or something, pause and ask: ""What's the more complex truth here?"" You'll be surprised how often there's a middle ground you hadn't considered.

## Staying Cool When Things Get Hot 🧊

We've all been there – that moment when someone pushes exactly the wrong button and you feel your blood pressure spike. Maybe it's a passive-aggressive text from your ex, a condescending comment from a family member, or getting stuck behind the world's slowest driver when you're already running late.

Emotional maturity isn't about never feeling angry, frustrated, or hurt. It's about maintaining your ability to think clearly even when your emotions are doing backflips. It's the difference between reacting and responding.

**The 24-Hour Rule:** When something really gets under your skin, give yourself 24 hours before taking any major action. Send that angry email to your drafts folder. Put down the phone before firing off that sarcastic response. Sleep on that big decision. You'll be amazed how different things look after your emotional storm has passed.

## Accepting the Good, Bad, and Ugly in Everyone 👥

Here's a uncomfortable truth: everyone you know has the capacity for both kindness and cruelty, generosity and selfishness, wisdom and foolishness. Yes, even your favorite person. Yes, even you.

This doesn't mean we should excuse harmful behavior or lower our standards. It means we can hold space for complexity. Your partner can be incredibly supportive and occasionally thoughtless. Your parent can be loving and also carry baggage that sometimes affects how they treat you. Your friend can be hilarious and fun while also being unreliable when it counts.

**Reality Check Exercise:** Think of someone who really annoys you. Now list three genuinely positive things about them. Then think of someone you adore and acknowledge one area where they're not perfect. This isn't about making excuses – it's about seeing people as whole human beings rather than cartoon characters.

## The Humility Factor 🙏

Nothing screams emotional immaturity quite like someone who thinks they have all the answers. We live in an age where everyone's an expert after reading a few articles online, where people argue passionately about topics they learned about five minutes ago.

Mature people know what they don't know. They're comfortable saying ""I'm not sure about that"" or ""I need to think about it more."" They change their minds when presented with new information instead of doubling down on positions that no longer make sense.

**Conversation Starter:** Instead of jumping in with your opinion, try asking questions first. ""Help me understand your perspective on this"" or ""What led you to that conclusion?"" You'll learn more, argue less, and people will actually enjoy talking with you.

## Walking Softly Through Life's Chaos 🚶‍♂️

Life has a way of serving up situations that test every ounce of patience you thought you had. Your flight gets canceled during a family emergency. Your teenager decides to experiment with purple hair the day before school photos. Your carefully planned project falls apart because of factors completely outside your control.

Emotional maturity shows up in how gently you move through these inevitable frustrations. It's about responding to life's curveballs with grace instead of drama, finding solutions instead of someone to blame.

**The Pause Practice:** Before reacting to any frustrating situation, take three deep breaths and ask yourself: ""Will this matter in five years? Five months? Five days?"" This simple question can save you from wasting energy on things that really don't deserve your emotional investment.

## Extending the Benefit of the Doubt ❤️

In our hyperconnected world, it's easy to assume the worst about people. That friend who didn't respond to your text must be ignoring you. The cashier who seems grumpy must be rude. The driver who cut you off must be a selfish jerk.

But what if your friend's phone died during a family crisis? What if the cashier just got some devastating news? What if that driver is rushing to the hospital? We usually don't know the full story behind other people's behavior, so why not assume positive intent until proven otherwise?

**Daily Kindness Challenge:** Once a day, actively choose to give someone the benefit of the doubt. When someone seems short with you, assume they're having a rough day rather than taking it personally. You'll find yourself feeling less frustrated and more connected to the people around you.

## Nobody Has All the Answers 📚

One of the most liberating realizations of adulthood is that nobody – absolutely nobody – has figured it all out. That confident person at work? They're winging it too. Your successful neighbor? They have moments of complete confusion. Your parents? They were making it up as they went along, just like you are now.

This isn't depressing – it's freeing. It means you can stop pretending to have answers you don't have. It means you can ask for help without feeling inadequate. It means you can admit mistakes without your world falling apart.

## Building Your Support Network 🤝

Since none of us have all the answers, we need each other. Mature people understand that asking for help isn't weakness – it's strategy. They build relationships before they need them. They offer support to others, knowing that what goes around comes around.

**Network Building Tip:** Instead of only reaching out when you need something, make it a habit to check in on people regularly. Send a ""thinking of you"" text. Offer to help with a project. Celebrate their wins. Strong relationships are built on mutual support, not emergency requests.

## The Daily Practice of Growing Up 🌟

Emotional maturity isn't a destination you reach and then coast. It's a daily practice, like physical fitness or learning a musical instrument. Some days you'll nail it, other days you'll react like you're still in middle school. That's normal and human.

**Your Maturity Workout:**
- Question your absolute thoughts
- Pause before reacting emotionally  
- Look for complexity in simple situations
- Practice humility in conversations
- Choose kindness when you could choose criticism
- Ask for help when you need it
- Offer support to others

## Why This Matters More Than Ever 🌍

In a world that often rewards the loudest voice, the quickest judgment, and the most extreme position, choosing emotional maturity is almost radical. It's choosing depth over surface, understanding over being understood, connection over being right.

These aren't just nice ideas – they're practical life skills that will improve your relationships, reduce your stress, and make you someone others actually want to be around. They'll help you navigate workplace politics, family dynamics, and friendship challenges with more ease and less drama.

## The Long View 🔭

The beautiful thing about developing emotional maturity is that it keeps paying dividends. The patience you develop today will serve you when you're dealing with aging parents tomorrow. The humility you practice now will help you adapt to changes you can't even imagine yet. The kindness you show to difficult people will echo back when you're the one having a hard day.

These skills aren't just for this moment, this year, or this decade. They're the kind of human capacities that remain valuable regardless of what technology emerges, what society looks like, or what challenges the future holds.

## Your Next Steps 📝

Starting tomorrow, pick one area from this guide and practice it for a week. Maybe it's pausing before reacting when something frustrates you. Maybe it's looking for the complexity in a situation where you usually see things in black and white. Maybe it's extending kindness to someone who's been getting on your nerves.

Small, consistent practices create lasting change. You don't need to transform overnight – you just need to commit to growing a little bit each day.

Remember: maturity isn't about perfection. It's about progress. It's about becoming someone who can handle life's inevitable challenges with grace, wisdom, and a generous heart. And that's a journey worth taking, one day at a time.

The fabric feels smooth with a bit of stretch, the collar sits sharp all day, and the buttons feel high quality. The small logo and nylon pocket detail add a modern, clean edge without being loud.

1n5dhlo,https://v.redd.it/tzcgjanrwgmf1,Espresso profiling and latte art with La Siene X,"Alright so last time I uploaded I got comments about how short the video was so here’s a longer one! Some background of me I started my coffee journey with the Mara X V2 I’m not a latte art expert but I’ve been trying to learn for the last 3 years! But I’ve not been able to consistently pour with the Mara x either cause it’s pretty hard to consistently get steam pressure to the 1 - 1.2 bar and the cool to touch wand feature even though sounds cool feels like adds lots of condensation and prevents consistent dry steam or lack of skills 🤣. With the Mara X I had a flow control kit installed which did help me profile my espresso. I remember being so excited about trying to profile a slayer shot, took me almost half a bag of beans to dial a good tasting one still not very satisfied. Enter this machine the La Siene X. Although very plasticky it definitely has some dope features! I really enjoy being able to profile espressos, in this video it’s not clear enough but I just setup a profile to slow ramp up to 3 bars first 13 seconds, next 20 seconds to 7 bars and then finish the shot at 3 bars. 20.5 gms in 42 gms out in about 40-45 seconds. I used Colombian beans with tasting notes of I don’t care what it was but that was a tasty as hell shot of espresso, pairs very well with milk based espresso drink. I’m making here a latte! All references made here are compared with the Mara X V2, I was able to get some really dry steam at consistent 1.5 bars of pressure I just pull the lever and wait till it gets to 1.5 bars and then start steaming the milk. The angle to get to steam the milk can be a bit painful cause the portafilter locks a bit towards the wand, as you can see in the video but it definitely works very well and being a beginner I’m able to get better milk texture consistently to pour good looking latte arts! Of course I was sent this machine for free in exchange for videos, but this is my unbiased opinion of the good sides of why I like this machine comparing to my Mara X v2. There are definitely some things I don’t enjoy as well like the group head doesn’t really heat up the portafilter, have to do a few flushes to warm it up. But at the same time trying to flush, the water splashes all over, hopefully they improve the grill design. There is no way to know whether the water tank is empty, with so many features like the milk temperature sensor, built in scales, I never thought it didn’t have something to tell ya you’re out of water. But at the same time, these are definitely knit picking the issues of the machine, I really enjoy playing around with the profiling!

""When a girl lets her hair down from the hat or ponytail or updo that has been present since the beginning, and it flows down over her shoulders and back without a trace of spray or styling product in it, in perfect soft curls. Nope!""
2. ""A character gets a code or lock combo or lengthy coordinates over the phone and never writes anything down, but remembers the whole sequence 24 hours later when they need it.""
3. ""When people are trying to hide from the bad guys, they keep whispering, or cracking the door open to look out, or moving curtains to peek out the window. I’m like, GET AWAY FROM THE FUCKING WINDOW!""
4. ""Actors holding cups and flailing them all over the place, like dude act like the cup is full or get water or some weights in it so you’re not flipping your to-go cup all over the place.""
5. [""When a character falls down a bottomless shaft or pit and somehow survives. (Star Wars).""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/williambarrios/best-star-wars-quotes)
6. [""One of my most hated movie clichés is about high school movies. With a few exceptions, once you hit 16 and can get a driver's license, you automatically either are given a car by your parents or you have your parents match your savings dollar for dollar so that you can get a semi-atttractive car for like $2,000. Also, with regard to teen movies, the characters with cars almost always are able to find a parking spot 10 feet from the front door and do not get yelled at for that.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marisamartinez/best-high-school-movies)
7. ""Someone surely already mentioned how toothbrushes in movies almost never actually have toothpaste on them. And couples are always fine with making out first thing in the morning with foul-ass morning breath.""
8. ""How about when the characters are in a very old house, the furniture is covered with sheets, there are cobwebs everywhere, and 4 inches of dust. Suddenly, they move an object that causes a giant dust cloud, and not one person sneezes, coughs, or gets asthma, and they casually continue about their business.""
9. ""I’ll never understand how, in most movies or TV shows, people always need just 30 minutes to do anything. Have to run across town? Be back in 30 minutes. Need to get something from the store? 30 minutes. Hell, I live in a small-ish town, and it takes longer than 30 minutes to run most errands due to driving time alone. Maybe that’s a reality in some areas but definitely not down here!""
10. ""Using a gun or having an explosion and hearing and talking fine afterwards. You'd be shouting and your ears would be damaged.""
11. ""The syringe in the neck. Every time I see a movie where a character gets a shot in the neck — ugh! That’s not how it’s done, Joyce! Or when they immediately get knocked out from the injection — if only it really happened that way smh.""
12. ""Knocking someone out by hitting them in the head often to avoid killing them. That person would need a hospital, could be bleeding internally, swelling, and all sorts.""
13. ""Female detectives are always carrying baggage from the past, like they didn’t find a killer fast enough, and they blame themselves for not saving the victim. They work 24x7, ARE always ‘withdrawn’, never smile, sleep, or eat (coffee only), and always have people telling them ‘hey, you need to talk to a therapist’, which they never do.""
14. ""I will never understand the thing where someone knocks or rings the doorbell, and when there is no answer, they take that as a sign to just... let themselves in. Then they call out 'Hello?' several times. Do people really just walk into other people's houses when they don't answer the door? Because where I'm from, that's a big old illegal.""
15. ""When they plan a dinner date and one of them says, 'I'll pick you up at 8.' You know it's going to take at least 20 minutes to get to the restaurant, another 10 to look at the menu and place an order, and 20-30 before the food is served, and that's assuming they're seated right away. So those people are eating dinner after 9 p.m., like that's completely normal when you work a 9-5 job.""
16. Post-apocalyptic related movies. The women are always still magically fully shaven, have clean and flowing hair, wear subtle makeup, and are not freaking out about where the heck they’re gonna find pads or tampons.""

18. ""Every Trans kid, for one, has to be deadnamed in the story (SO unnecessary). Two, they  have a scene where they're running from their bullies. Yes, as a trans person, many, if not most, of us have traumatic backstories. But hey, what if we imagined a world where that wasn't the case? What if? Let's try it once, just to see how it goes. Can we just be queer and not have the story start with trauma?? Can we be gay or bi or trans and not have bullies chase us? Can we just try to imagine a world where kids can just be loved and accepted? Let's try it.""
19. ""Perfectly organized bedrooms/apartments/homes. Spaces hardly ever look lived in, with things just left out or lying around. Or if the spaces are like that, it looks staged.""
20. ""Women going to bed in full makeup. Women waking up in the morning with full makeup. Women depicted as depressed, drug binges, homeless, on the run from monsters or the law, etc, etc, with full makeup. 🙄""
21. ""The hand-cut one always gets me. If someone needs a little blood, why do they need such a big ass dramatic cut on the palm of their hand?? That is the last spot I'd go for!!""

23. ""Mine is the stupid L-shaped blanket that covers up women's chests and men's waists, and then when they get out of bed, they've got their underwear on.""

26. ""Mine is when people have sex covered up UNDER the blankets... literally NO ONE does that.""
27. ""In horror films, when they hit/stab the killer only once and then run away.  THAT'S NOT GOING TO STOP HIM.""
28. ""Romanticizing hidden pregnancies / secret parentage. A woman sleeps with a guy, clearly raises the child alone for X years, and then THERE'S some magical romantic reveal about their real father / your child I never told you about. So she never needed child support? She didn’t need help? She just wanted him to be able to live his life unburdened by a baby, but now it’s cute to reunite everyone, and we are all going to embrace and be normal about this new life-changing information?""

It either immediately nosedives, instantaneously combusts, shakes overdramatically, or some mixture of the three. Like dude, I know stuff like that can happen if the damage is in the right place, but seriously. Planes can still fly and land relatively okay with damage, even if they’re completely riddled with bullets like a WWII bomber I once heard about.""

33. ""In so many movies, a simple misunderstanding turns into this huge thing and drives the plot. Something gets said out of context, and it becomes this huge thing, when in reality a normal person would call or talk to that person and say, 'Hey, did you say this about me?' Then the other person will explain and put it in context, and the conflict is over in 5 minutes, not 90 minutes.""
34. ""When the villain walks slowly, chasing a victim who runs away from him, and is still able to catch the victim.""
35. ""I don't like it when a main character does something unusually cruel to some random person, only for that person to turn out to be a bad guy in the end. How was the main character supposed to know??""
36. ""Mostly in action movies, but in other genres as well, someone falls over a cliff and they are grabbed by someone else (sometimes with only one hand). That's a lot of dead weight to be carrying, and the average person can't hold that much weight. Plus, most of these people don't have the best position to hold all that weight. Double bonus if they also then pull that person up with one hand. And let's not even get started on grip strength. Chances are, even if you can pull the person up, you'll probably lose your grip at some point.""
37. [""Hazmat gear. I've been a hazmat guy, and while I love shows like Breaking Bad, the way they 'wear' the gear should leave them overdosed and dead on the floor.

39. ""Fist fights where NO ONE is bruised or has swollen faces AFTER the fight!""
40. ""I hate when people who have broken up or hate each other for some reason go through a crisis of some sort and are instantly best friends or in love afterward, without any sort of relevant work on their relationships. I would really like to see something where enemies have to work together to solve a crisis but at the end still think each other is an asshole and go their separate ways.""

42. ""When the cops or FBI see the bad guy a block away and yell at them to freeze or whatever, or all the cops are at the front door with no one at the back door, both make it easy for the bad guy to get away.""
43. ""A cop or detective, one day from retirement,  WHO gets the case of a lifetime that they just have to solve, and they end up discovering a newfound love of policing and don’t retire.

1n5dgub,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n5dgub/rf_when_fate_framed_us_together/,[RF] When Fate Framed Us Together,"**Before We Met — We Were Meant**  
A story of fate, quiet love, and moments that make you believe in destiny.

**1. Weekend Nostalgia**  
It was a quiet Sunday afternoon.

Dhaval sat on the couch, a warm cup of chai in hand, lazily flipping through his old college trip photos. Anamika, his wife of four years, was in the kitchen humming an old song, unaware of what was about to unfold.

They had an arranged marriage — no long dating phase, no college romance, just two strangers who chose to build a life together. And somehow, they made it work. Long drives, late-night talks, and shared silences had turned them into best friends over the years.

But what Dhaval saw that day would change everything he believed about chance.

**2. The Photo Frame of Fate**  
Click. Click. Swipe.

He paused.

One photo from his Udaipur college trip caught his eye — a random group photo in front of the City Palace. It wasn’t the palace or his college friends that made him freeze.

It was her.

Blurred, in the background, almost hidden behind a group of tourists, stood a girl in a yellow kurta. She wasn’t posing. She was just walking past.

But he knew that face.  
That smile.  
That walk.

It was Anamika.  
His wife.

**3. Destiny in a Snapshot**  
He stared at the photo in disbelief.

How was this possible?  
They had never met before marriage. Or so he thought.

And yet, here she was, captured in a photo from seven years ago, when they were both college students, unknown to each other.

He rushed to the kitchen.

“Anamika! Come here, you need to see this.”

She wiped her hands and walked over.  
He pointed to the photo.

“Look closely. Isn’t that… you?”

She squinted.

Her eyes widened. A small gasp escaped her lips.  
“Yes… that’s me! Oh my God, that is me. I had gone to Udaipur with my friends around that time.”

Silence.

They both looked at each other.  
Smiled.  
And then burst into laughter — the kind that comes from pure joy and quiet wonder.

**4. When Something Is Meant to Be**  
They sat together for hours that day, looking through more photos, sipping tea, and talking about the strange, beautiful coincidence that had always lived in their past — quietly waiting to be discovered.

That photo became more than just a frozen moment.  
It became a reminder.

A reminder that when something is meant for you, it will find its way to you —  
in a city you don’t remember,  
in a frame you didn’t notice,  
in a person you were yet to fall in love with.

Sometimes, destiny doesn’t knock on your door loudly.  
It whispers, hides in pixels, and waits — patiently — for the day you’ll finally see it.

**5. Udaipur — Again, but Together**  
A week later, they were walking hand in hand near the same City Palace, this time as husband and wife.

It wasn’t a lavish trip — just two people reliving a strange twist of fate. They took selfies near the spot where the original photo had been clicked. Laughed again. Talked for hours over lakeside coffee. Shared new memories in a place that had unknowingly started their story years ago.

They even recreated that blurry photo — this time, intentionally — smiling directly into the lens.

That night, over dinner, Dhaval said, “It’s like the universe left us a trail — and we finally followed it.”

Anamika nodded, eyes glowing. “We were always meant to find each other. This… was just proof.”

They ended the night planning a weekend movie and dinner date, soaking in the serendipity that life had gifted them — again.

**Final Thought**  
Go with the flow.  
Trust the timing of your life.

Because when something is truly meant for you — it won’t pass you by.  
It will find you. In its own time. In its own quiet, magical way.",1,1756695288.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1756695231.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

I wanna preface this by saying I don't want to turn this into a flipping business! I'm not looking to be an instagram flipper person/business. If anything, I would still do this for free.

The city I'm living in has SO so much stuff put out on sidewalks for people to take. More often than not, it’s completely useable (not smashed/destroyed).  
I'm a super crafty, DIY person so I love being able to upcycle and restore literally anything. I've literally furnished a majority of my apartment with things i've thrifted and found on the sidewalk. For example, some of the things I've found for free: an espresso machine, 10+ lamps, multiple dining chairs, plant pots galore, rugs, dressers, a fan, mirrors, dvd player, a bunch of vinyls, a sick coffee table, car roof boxes, dishes, endless bits and bobs, etc. A majority of it was in good condition but I've cleaned, restored and repaired many things.  
Like the espresso machine, fan and dvd player were very basic repairs that almost anyone could do.

I want to keep doing this but I officially have no more space and can't store things.   
But I wan't to keep upcycling to keep things out of landfill. Like today I saw about 3-4 large furniture pieces that I would have taken to fix up. They were all nice quality, though could definitely use some tlc. All I want to do is give things a second life, clean them up and let someone else enjoy it.  
I also really love the idea of salvaging as much as possible. For example, the wood from broken furniture, hardware, hinges, knobs, glass, table legs, leather from torn couches etc. That kind of stuff.

1n5dbmm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5dbmm,Liquid Magnolia,"Here's another of my favorite drinks for a NA evening.  This one features a couple unusual ingredients:

  
\* Magnolia petal tea.  I make this from the spent flowers of the Magnolia grandiflora trees around my neighborhood. After the blooms are are spent, they drop a fragrant and rather interesting tasting petal.  I collect a bunched handful,.wash them well, and then boil in about 2 liters of water. (See second picture). I then strain through a paper coffee filter and chill.  The aroma is intensely floral, just like the flower, but with a more dusty or woody note.  The flavor, by itself, is kind of bitter with a vegetal quality to it.  But with a little sweetness, this turns into a lovely ""briskness"".  It very much reminds me of the bite of a strongly brewed iced sweet tea, but the bite is a little less sharp and more rounded.

\* Plum cheong.  It is a Korean syrup made with plums that are slowly broken down in sugar.  The flavor is exactly like Asian plum wine, which shouldn't be a surprise because these wines are sweetened with this.  I find cheongs in general to be a great upgrade to fruit syrups you'd use for things like Italian sodas.  They almost taste fruitier than the fruit they are made from! 

\* I finished with soda water and some diced frozen bits of plum in the place of ice cubes 

  
With the right ratio of magnolia, cheong, and soda, the drink winds up kind of tasting like a bubbly iced tea.  Except none of the flavors are quite the same.  Both the aromatics from the magnolia and the complex fruit notes of the cheong give plenty to entertain your taste buds, and the brisk finish of the magnolia encourage you to sip and let the experience sit in your mouth for a bit.  

The ratios are probably around this:



\* 3 parts soda

  
\* 1 part cheong

  
\* 2 parts chilled magnolia tea.  You may need more or less depending on how strong you brewed it.

I have been married to my wife for over 10 years and have 2 kids 9M and 7F. My wife physically and verbs abused me when we were visiting relative house.

She got mad for that ( literally this one), I asked her politely that we are other relative house and this is not a big deal. She could warm her coffee. Any ways, long story short, she got mad, physically abused me in front of the kids. When I went in the room to get my car keys and wallet, she followed and wanted to take the car key away. She againt physically punched me in the face, i tried to get her away but she took off my glasses and wallet and blocked the door and demanded to give me the car keys as well.

1n5d9x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n5d9x8/my_girlfriend_and_i_get_tortured_for_a_living/,My girlfriend and I get tortured for a living. Something went seriously wrong during her last session and now she's different,"I've always had a bit of a passion for odd jobs. 

When I was a teenager, I discovered Craigslist, and everything just kind of snowballed from there. You wouldn't believe the kinds of things you can find on the internet - the kind of jobs you can secure without having to do any paperwork. Most of the time the people hiring either don't want to be traceable by the government, or they're just far too desperate at that point to add any additional hoops to jump through. 

That was how I met Chelsea. It was actually a really funny story, perfect for telling at parties. It would be perfect for our wedding, too, and for telling our kids. It would have been, at least. 

We met because we had both been hired to come to this birthday party, a kid turning eleven. Neither of us fully knew what the job entailed when we agreed, which might have been a sign that we shouldn't have, but we were both informed we'd be paid handsomely, and that was all that either of us needed to hear. 

When we got there Frank, a middle aged guy with a salt-and-pepper beard who smelled strongly of patchouli and marinara sauce, informed us we were to get in a huge screaming match around the middle of the party. We were playing a couple from a few houses down who were really on the fritz, I guess. We weren't told why, just what to do. I'm still not sure why he wanted us to do that. 

I was hesitant. I wasn't much of an actor. But Chelsea, she threw herself into the role wholeheartedly. A couple of hours later we were sitting on the curb a block away, and she was holding a bag of frozen carrots against my swollen cheekbone, and I was nursing a blunt, wincing at how my chocolate milk soaked clothing stuck to my skin. 

We compared stories of our strangest jobs, our craziest experiences, the worst things we'd ever done to make a couple bucks. We both agreed that anything below a felony was fair game, but we gravitated towards weird yet legal and harmless tasks. She had a passion for all of it that I'd never seen in anyone I'd ever met. She was really doing it for the experiences, not the money. She was a thrill seeker. 

I fell in love with her quickly, like getting hit over the head with a blunt object. It was aggressive and immediate. 

A couple of months later we got a place together, and the rest was history. We fell into a nice, domestic routine: she made me coffee in the morning and kissed my forehead when I walked into the kitchen, we took turns cooking dinner and doing the dishes and we watched hours of reality television slop on our sofa that was just big enough for two. We talked about the future. We talked about a dog and two kids and a yard. It all just fell into place. 

Her friends liked me, and my friends liked her, and our families were the same. My mother became a little too obsessed with having a grandchild, and I had to beg her to stop asking Chelsea about her cycle. But none of them knew about our secret life, the jobs we did together when everyone went home. It was just for us, and it was exciting, this secret hobby that we shared. 

The first call from OEM came on a quiet Friday. Chelsea was at her job as a barista, and I was at home getting some cleaning done before having lunch with my parents, like an old person. 

I was used to getting calls that didn't have identification, considering all my side jobs, so I didn't bat an eye at the NO CALLER ID on my screen. What was different, however, was the automated message that played as soon as I picked up the call. 

""*This call may be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Please state your first and last name, and your date of birth.*"" 

I frowned, tossing the rag I'd been cleaning the stove with onto the kitchen counter. 

""Julian Raines, May 14th, 1999."" 

There was a silence, and then a beep. Then a man spoke, non-automated this time. 

""*Hello, Mr. Raines. I've been informed you might be looking for a job?*"" 

When Chelsea got home, I was waiting for her on the couch. She came up behind me, cupped my face in her hands, and kissed the top of my head. 

""Hey, babe,"" I said, trying to keep the excitement out of my voice. ""How was work?"" 

""Exhausting."" She slumped over the back of the couch, smushing the cushions. ""But I got this crazy voicemail..."" 

The facility was in what looked, from the outside, like a dilapidated warehouse. The man who picked us up in a long black car was very quiet, answering our questions in single word responses and keeping his eyes on the road. Chelsea and I kept giving each other small glances and squeezing each other's hands the entire way there. 

A man greeted us at the car door, opening it for us with a smile. He was tall and thin, and he wore a crisp suit with his dark hair slicked back, not a strand askew. 

""Mr. and Mrs. Raines, I presume?"" 

Chelsea looked down shyly. I was surprised, she was never shy - but this situation definitely felt more professional than what we were used to. 

""We aren't married..."" 

""Oh! Oh, I'm sorry."" The man tapped his forehead with the palm of his hand good-naturedly. ""I'm so sorry, miss...?""

""Sutherland."" 

""Miss Sutherland, of course."" He reached out to shake her hand, and then mine, eager. ""My name is Malcolm Kessler. You can just call me Kessler. Would you like to know what you're doing here?"" 

We let Kessler lead us into the building. On the inside, it looked far less run down... we were greeted with long white hallways and bustling professionals holding coffees and clipboards, wearing matching white lab coats. 

""Is this like... a hospital?"" Chelsea asked, gazing around in awe. I took her hand again, and she gave it a squeeze. 

""No, not a hospital... although there are medical professionals here, and we do certainly have access to those kinds of tools."" He offered us a sly grin. 

We entered a room with a metal table and four chairs, and not much else. A woman with her hair tied up in a tight bun came in, placed a stack of papers on the table, and scurried away. Kessler gestured for us to take a seat. 

""This,"" he said slowly, looking from me, to Chelsea, and back again. ""This is OEM. Do you know what that stands for?"" He waited for us to shake our heads before continuing. ""This is the Office of Enhanced Methods."" 

I blinked at him, the white fluorescent lights making my eyes burn. ""What does that mean?"" 

""I'm glad you ask."" Kessler leaned back in his seat, folding his hands in his lap. ""Essentially, here at OEM, we test torture methods. See what works, see what doesn't, see what we need to change or scale back on. You know."" 

I could feel Chelsea looking at me. I looked back. I couldn't quite read her expression, but somehow I still could get the gist. 

""Is this... um... a government project?"" She asked, her eyes still locked on mine and her brows furrowing. 

Kessler chuckled. ""You could say that.""

""So why do you need us?"" I asked, even though I felt I might know the answer, finally looking away from my girlfriend and back at the man in front of us. 

Kessler sighed, leaning forward again, resting his elbows on the table. He had quite a sharp face, but it managed to feel charming and welcoming purely from his expression. I wondered if he'd practiced that. ""I'll level with you,"" he said, quieter than before. ""We need volunteers. But finding volunteers for something like this is... difficult. That's why now we're looking for people like you, people who are interested in doing odd jobs like this one, and we're offering a large amount of compensation."" 

I pressed my lips together, searching his face for any sign of deception or exaggeration. I found none. I glanced back at Chelsea, who was looking at the stack of paperwork. 

""How much compensation?"" I asked finally, when it became clear that no one else was going to say it. I expected Kessler to laugh. He didn't. 

""Are you two looking to get married?"" 

I felt the room heat up. Truthfully, I had bought the ring a month ago. I was just waiting for the right time, and a time when we could properly plan for a wedding without the stress of becoming bankrupt for it. 

""Yes, I mean, eventually..."" 

""Have you seen how much those venues cost these days?"" Kessler raised his eyebrows sympathetically, leaning even closer to us. ""Not to mention a honeymoon... are you looking to have kids, start a family? Send those kids to college? Grow old and retire?"" 

The man actually reached out, actually took my hand in one of his and Chelsea's in his other. I felt like the air in the room was being sucked out of it. 

""I'm going to be honest with you two, I am not going to mince words. It's tough out there right now. I could make it so you never have to worry about money again."" 

He left us in the room to let us talk alone, and I could have sworn I heard the lock click behind him, but to be fair I was feeling pretty jumpy by that point. Chelsea and I sat for a moment in silence. 

""This is a lot,"" she muttered, running her fingers through her hair. ""This place is crazy."" 

I reached over to flip through the paperwork, chewing on my bottom lip. I saw words like non-disclosure agreement, liability, medical care... I put the paperwork back down and took her hand again. 

""It's a lot of money. He seemed serious.""

""Would we be considered... like... war criminals? If we took part in this?"" She laughed, but I could tell she was anxious. 

I shrugged slowly. She rubbed at her face with her free hand, a nervous habit of hers. I reached over and tucked some hair behind her ear, smiling. She smiled back apprehensively. 

There was something neither of us were saying, something neither of us wanted to point out. *How bad was the job to offer that amount of compensation?* 

Still, there was a buzz between us. This was what we did, we signed up for strange things for the experiences... Chelsea lived for things like this. I think I knew the second we got there that she would end up wanting to do it. 

When Kessler came back, I stood up, pushing my chair back and wiping my sweaty hands on my jeans. 

""What kind of torture are we talking about?"" 

His smile was wide. ""I can show you now, if you'd like."" 

He explained as he lead us back down the hall, guiding us into a different room that was essentially the exact same as the one we had just been in, but with more cameras mounted on the walls and with different chairs... I winced a little when I saw the wrist and ankle restraints attached to the sterile metal frame.

""Everything we do here stays within these walls,"" he told us, gesturing for us to take a seat. Chelsea and I shared a look, then obeyed. ""Communication wise, but also physically. We will do nothing to permanently damage you, and we have medical staff on sight for any treatment you may need."" 

As if on cue, a man in one of the lab coats bustled into the room, pushing a cart. He began strapping down our wrists, leaving our legs unrestrained. 

""Everything is voluntary,"" Kessler continued. ""Nothing will happen to you without your explicit consent, although we may need to withhold some details in order to get the most accurate read on your reactions. You can leave or discontinue your contracts at any time."" 

The man in the lab coat started putting on medical gloves. I swallowed hard. 

""What is he going to do?"" 

Kessler nodded at the man, who procured a syringe from his cart, examining the needle carefully and then picking up a little glass bottle to draw from. 

""This is just... let's call it a sample. This is something we've been working on for a while, it's already been tested many times with a high success rate."" 

I wondered what a high success rate in this context was. A large sum of pain? The right amount of screaming? 

""Usually, we'd probably hook you up to various brain wave sensors, but we'll start light today."" 

The doctor (was he a doctor?) approached Chelsea, who squirmed anxiously. He wiped her arm with an alcohol swab, and began feeling around for a good vein. I watched her, trying to look encouraging when her eyes met mine. 

""This is a sort of... *liquid electrocution*. Per say."" 

Before either of us could reply to that, the doctor was inserting the needle into Chelsea's arm and pushing down on the plunger. 

I watched her body seize up, her eyes going wide and glassy. She was perfectly still for a moment, save for her mouth falling open and her entire face going slack... and then she began to twitch and spasm, her limbs jerking with no control. Then she screamed, a gurgling, horrifying sound, and I was struck with panic. 

I was so distracted I barely felt the needle sliding into my own arm. 

And then it felt like I was being set on fire. 

We didn't go back to that place for a couple of months. Kessler told us to take our time, to think about it, as he handed us a tall stack of dollar bills. The feeling of the money almost bulging out of my pocket almost made up for the pain. 

He had told the truth: it didn't last. It felt like the effects of the injection lasted an hour, but we were told it had only been a few minutes before it wore off. I expected to be weak leaving the facility, and prepared myself to be embarrassed to handle it worse than my girlfriend did, but the feeling faded fast. In fact, I almost felt more alive. 

We were given a brief interview where a younger man scribbled extensive notes, and then we were free to go. 

The first thing Chelsea said to me when we got outside was, ""What a rush!"" 

Still, we waited a while. It felt like a next step in our odd jobs hobby to make this a regular thing, like something a little bit depraved. It was dystopian, it was strange and scary. Even though the sensation was gone, I could vividly remember what the injection had done to me, how it had torn through my veins, how I had wondered if I was dying... and that was supposed to just be a *sample*. 

But eventually, neither of us could stay away. The money was good... beyond good. 

At first, we kept it a secret from each other, as if we were doing something bad. She would head off to work, and I would drive to the warehouse. They would inject me, feed me things that made me sick, toss me around, even beat me, and then I would drive home, still reeling and sore. Chelsea started acting strange, staying up after I went to bed, but I couldn't exactly call her out on it, because I was being strange too. 

Neither of us wanted to put any pressure on the other, I guess. And I don't think either of us liked the idea of the other getting tortured. 

It was all but confirmed in my mind that we were both doing the same thing when I caught her coming through the front door at almost three AM, rubbing at her temple like she had a horrible migraine. I was sitting on the couch, reading a book, waiting for her. 

She stopped cold, her eyes going wide. I couldn't help but chuckle. 

""Cheating on me?"" I asked. She laughed, plopping down next to me on the couch. 

""Not exactly."" 

I pulled her to me, and she rested her head on my shoulder. 

""Let's just do it together, okay? From now on, let's just go together."" 

I waited for an answer, but after a minute, all I got was a snore. 

We went together the next weekend. Kessler greeted us, patting each of us on our backs cheerfully. 

""Great to see you two together again! The work you both have been doing here is just fantastic."" 

Chelsea and I eyed each other, and she gave me a little punch on the arm. I grinned at her. 

""I have something different for you two today, now that you're here together, if you're up for it."" 

My smile faded a little, twisting into mild concern. I licked my lips. ""Different how?"" 

He waved me off, guiding us into one of the rooms. The same chairs greeted us, with their cuffs and restraints. A doctor was already inside, toying with some kind of strap. It looked sort of like a headband. 

""We'd like to try something more... psychological... than you're used to."" 

I stopped in my tracks. Kessler and Chelsea both turned to face me, their eyebrows raising in sync. 

""Psychological torture?"" I was getting vivid images in my head, all of the psychological horror movies I'd ever seen rushing back to me. Physical pain was one thing, but sanity was delicate, something that shouldn't be played with. 

Kessler approached me, placing his hands on each of my shoulders, and offered me a reassuring smile. 

""Think about it, Mr. Raines,"" he said, his voice kind. ""It will be a brief test, it'll only last around thirty seconds. Like I've said, nothing will leave this facility, and we have professionals to assess your mental state directly afterwards. Thirty seconds for enough money to buy a used car."" 

I worried my lips together, the fear I'd had in the past creeping back in... if it wasn't dangerous, why was it worth so much? Worth more than we'd been paid for anything before? 

""Come on, Jules."" Chelsea smiled at me from behind him. She didn't look afraid, and it soothed me a little. ""We'll do it together."" 

I nodded reluctantly. Almost as soon as my chin raised to do so, the doctor was slipping the headband on, two metal plates digging into my forehead. I felt my muscles tense up. 

We took our seats, and Chelsea reached over to grab my hand. They didn't strap us down this time, which I hardly thought about until after it was too late. 

The doctor put Chelsea's headband on too, and she made a face at me, which made me bite back a laugh. 

""Ready?"" Kessler asked. Then he nodded at the doctor, who pressed something on what looked like a keyboard, and Julie started to scream. 

The second he touched the thing, she was screaming. 

It wasn't like any scream I had ever heard before, not like the one from the first time we'd been here and not in any horror movie. Certainly never in real life. It felt like my eardrums were bursting, and it only grew louder and more shrill. 

It was desperate. It was beyond torture, beyond pain, beyond anything a human could possibly endure. I imagined hell, I imagined that souls being dragged to damnation, might sound something like that scream. I wasn't even religious. 

She squeezed my hand and I felt my bones cracking. 

""Chelsea! Chelsea?"" 

I rocketed out of my seat, trying to shake her, trying to ignore the searing pain. She wouldn't let go of my hand, couldn't. Her eyes were wide open and dead, looking right at me but not seeing anything. Still, tears streamed from them, more tears than I'd ever seen anyone cry. 

I whipped back around. The doctor was typing urgently at his computer, and Kessler was staring, his hands out and his eyes moving rapidly back and forth like he was in shock. 

""Jesus Christ, do something!"" I screamed. ""Fucking do something!"" 

Chelsea was gasping now, a ragged sound that bounced around in my head. It felt like I could hear nothing but that horrible wet gasp, just dead air and her throat clawing for breath, drool seeping from her mouth and down her chin. 

Finally, I ripped the headband off her. Instantly she went slack, letting go of my hand. 

The room was silent for a moment. Then Kessler muttered something to the other man, and the doctor rushed out the door. 

""Chelsea? Chelsea, baby are you okay?"" I kneeled in front of her, rubbing her knee. She wouldn't look at me, wouldn't move. For a second, I wondered if she was dead. ""Please answer me..."" 

Right when I was about to check her pulse, her head turned. She wasn't screaming anymore, but her eyes were just as dead as they had been before when they met mine. They didn't even look like her eyes anymore. 

She opened her mouth, and out of it came a horrible whispery sound, like she'd forgotten how to use her tongue. I leaned in closer, trying to smile at her weakly. 

""What is it, honey?"" 

""Please,"" she gasped. ""No more."" 

I felt hot, I felt like I had a horrible fever. I reached up, touched her wet face. ""It's over, baby. No more. It's over."" 

She stared at me, if you could call it that. She wasn't in her body anymore. This was something else. She twitched. 

""Just kill me..."" 

I turned back to look at Kessler. He looked just as shocked as I did, anxiously adjusting his tie. For a long moment we met eyes, and I knew what he was thinking. Something had gone horribly, unbelievably wrong here. 

And he didn't know how to fix it. 

The next few hours were a horrible blur. I remember doctors rushing around, wheeling Chelsea out of the room despite my pleas to know where they were going, to let me go with them. I sat alone in the cold, sterile room, her scream echoing around in my head. I cried, I begged the cameras in the corners of the room, I banged my head against the table. Someone came in and bandaged up my broken hand, but no one would tell me anything. 

It felt like days that I was in there. Honestly, it could have been. When the door finally opened again and Kessler stepped through it, I couldn't even feel relieved... I just felt broken. 

""Where is she?"" I croaked, raising my head. ""Is she okay?"" 

He said nothing, just sat down in front of me. He was back to business, the horrified expression I'd last seen him have completely wiped away, although I could have sworn his face was a little pale. 

He took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the metal table between us. 

""Miss Sutherland is right outside. She's unharmed, and feeling fine."" 

I choked out a sob: I couldn't help it. I hid my face in my hands. Kessler cleared his throat and continued. 

""You are to take this envelope. Inside is a check for seven hundred thousand dollars. One of our drivers is going to take you to the emergency room, where you will have your hand properly treated. Any further medical bills will be completely covered by us. You are to do this, and then go home and never return here. Do you understand?"" 

I looked up at him, and I nodded. I was angry: I wanted to yell, demand answers, threaten to sue... but I was far too exhausted for any of that. I just wanted to see Chelsea, I just wanted to go home. Kessler nodded, his mouth pressed into a thin line. 

""We at OEM are terribly ashamed about what took place today. Please accept our deepest condolences.""

Something about that rubbed me the wrong way, made my skin prickle, but my mind was numb. I just nodded again, taking the envelope and shoving it into my pocket. 

Chelsea was just outside like he'd said, and she smiled when she saw me. I gathered her in my arms and squeezed, breathing in the scent of her hair, kissing the side of her neck. 

""Thank god you're okay."" 

""Hey, hey, don't cry..."" She pulled back, kissing my cheek and wiping away my tears. ""I'm more than okay, baby. What a rush!"" 

A laugh burst out of me like an uncontrollable cough.

""You're a psychopath.""

""You like it."" 

As promised, we were taken to the hospital, where I was put in a cast. My hand was broken in three different places. As Chelsea sat with me while they examined it, a horrible, anxious feeling crept over me. When I looked at her, all she did was smile. 

I couldn't sleep that night. I stared at the ceiling, white spots drifting across my vision, my hand throbbing dully on my chest. Chelsea's back pressed against the side of my arm was the only thing that made me feel any calmer. I turned to look at the back of her head, chewing on my lip. 

The room felt too quiet, too dark after spending so long in that bright sterile room. I was restless. 

""Chelsea?"" I whispered. ""Are you awake?"" 

She said nothing. She wasn't snoring, but I swore I could hear her heart beating. *Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I sighed. ""What did you feel? When it was happening?"" 

I knew she wouldn't respond, but I asked anyways. I needed to talk, even if it was just to myself. 

*Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I felt her shift a little, her back moving with each of her breaths. Her heartbeat began to speed up. Only then did I begin to wonder why I could hear it at all, and so loud. 

I sat up a little, leaning on my elbows. I stroked her hair. 

""Hey, baby... are you okay?"" 

No answer. *Ka-thunk ka-thunk ka-thunk...*

Suddenly I had that feeling. I had that feeling children get at night, when they become positive there's someone in the closet or just outside their bedroom door, someone they don't know. Panic raced through me, and whether it was rational or not, I had to see her face. I had to be sure she was alive, and she was herself, and she was real. 

I reached over and took her arm, rolling her towards me. 

Chelsea's eyes were wide open, bloodshot, and my heart jumped into my throat when I realized it hadn't been her heartbeat that I had been hearing. It had been her gasping for air, her throat closing and opening again rapidly, swallowing and heaving dryly in the dark like an animal about to throw up. *Ka-thunk-ka-thunk-ka-thunk*... 

I shook her awake, sitting straight up in the bed. She gasped, blinking at me almost sleepily, rubbing at her eyes. 

""Julian...?"" Her voice was raspy, tired and dry, but otherwise normal. I flicked on the bedside lamp, breathing hard. ""Babe, what's wrong?"" 

I shook my head. I couldn't look at her, couldn't breathe. I felt her wrap her arms around me, shushing me gently and stroking my hair. 

""You... you were..."" 

""Shh, it's okay. It's okay now, Jules, I'm okay. Just a bad dream..."" 

But it wasn't a dream. I knew it wasn't. 

After that my girlfriend was different. She wasn't herself. 

I tried to go back to normal... she certainly tried to. She went to work like before, saw her friends, watched television with me on our couch. But it didn't feel like she was really there anymore. She didn't sleep much at all, and when she did, it was strange and restless. I more than once caught her sleeping with her eyes wide open, just like that first night. 

Once I asked her what her dreams had been like recently and she hesitated, before telling me: 

""You know how when meat is fresh, and the muscles are still alive, so they move and squirm even though the animal is dead?"" She smiled and ruffled my hair. ""That's what the backs of my eyelids look like."" 

The worst part was how normal she pretended to be. How fine she told me she felt, how she kissed me like always and how she tried to joke, but it never came out quite right. 

I reached my limit one night a month later when I got home after having a drink with some friends. 

The house was completely dark, completely silent, completely still. The second I opened the door, I felt it. The unexplainable terror. Like there was a man in the closet. 

It didn't feel right in there. Nothing felt like it was in the right place, even though I knew it must have been. Everything just felt wrong. 

""Chelsea?"" I called out quietly, shrugging off my jacket, wet from the rain. ""Are you awake, honey?"" 

No answer. I went to go upstairs when I saw her. 

She was down our hallway. Her head was half poking out around the corner, only her eyes showing in the darkness, wide open. Staring at me, but not seeing me. 

She started to scream, and it was even worse to not be able to see her mouth. She screamed in short bursts, like a panting dog, the bloodcurdling sounds jolting out of her. 

Fight or flight kicked in. I turned around and walked right back out the door, closing it behind me. I walked until I was across the street before looking back at the house. 

She was in our bedroom window, the lights turned on, illuminating her silhouette. I watched her rear back and slam her head into the glass once, then again, then again, something dark and liquid trickling down to the frame. 

The paramedics had to tie her down to keep her from thrashing, or from hurting herself. 

I watched as they took her away, begging them to kill her. 

I tried to call OEM, but all I got was a message that the number had been disconnected. I drove back there while she was still in the hospital, but there was nothing left but an empty warehouse. 

When I picked her up, she was completely normal again, the only proof of the episode being the stitches on her forehead. 

It was that day, the day I picked her up, when I felt completely broken down and helpless, that I started to hear her voice. 

""*Honey...?*"" 

I looked over at my girlfriend, or what my girlfriend had become. She was staring out the window, smiling peacefully. 

""What was that?""

She glanced at me, her smile widening. ""Nothing, Julian. I didn't say anything."" 

I turned back to the road, convinced I was just losing my mind. I had to be. It would make sense. 

But then I heard it again. 

""*Julian, open your eyes, honey, it's okay... Jesus Christ, Kessler, would you take that thing off him? I think he's had enough!*"" ",8,1756694685.0,nosleep,1,0.9,False

So I guess I'm pretty picky sometimes.  I've gotten better at finding things to eat, but sometimes it's hard, for different reasons I won't get into.

Right now, I need more protein,  earlier in the day. I don't usually have breakfast except for milky coffee cause I'm nauseous if I eat to early, and I often forget to eat lunch. Then I'm cranky (surprised Pikachu face)! 

I finally decided to try smoothies because drinking is easier than eating, especially when I'm nauseous.  However, I don't like nut butter or bananas which seem to be the main ingredient in smoothies. I'm medium about yogurt, but willing to try. 

But I also have no idea how much of anything to put in. Online recipes are hard because almost all of them call for nut butter or bananas, which I'm not a fan of. I'm also nervous about protein powder because I am not a huge fan of chocolate and fake vanilla can be nauseating. 

Any suggestions for smoothie recipes? I plan to use frozen fruit, milk or yogurt, or OJ if those are gross the first time and maybe some honey. Also thinking of freezing the yogurt and then throwing it in, for like a smoother feel.

May I start off by saying, if you are subscribed to this subreddit, then [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zvubggYPxSgtjFaPIRLVthTRMs6Szt-Ce8JZJHRuO-4/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) is not for you... at least not directly. However, there may be someone in your life who could benefit from learning the utmost basics of fantasy football. You see, I started a work fantasy football league this year, and the the demographic of people I work with does not skew as the typical ""football fan"". I work with a bunch or nerdy people and the gender skews toward the majority being women. I decided to create this nifty slideshow to explain the basic rules and structure of Fantasy Football, to people who know nothing about fantasy football, or maybe even nothing about the game of football, in general.

**This slideshow is for that person/people in your life who are pure and naïve, the unsuspicious and unassuming. Those who don't know what kind of dastardly trap they have fallen into until it's far too late. Plant the seeds, my dear brethren. Recruit your spouse/partner/sibling/parent/grandparent/friend/friend of a friend/coworker/neighbor/neighbor's neighbor/coffee barista/barber/mailman/that one person you haven't seen from high school 12 years ago until today/the person you do that awkward shuffle with on the street, or in a public hallway, as you both walk at each other, but you both try to avoid each other, but you both picked the same direction, so you both then correct the other way, and this keeps happening until you both just stop moving and say to each other ""after you"" with a gesture, and finally one person stays put and the other person goes, and then you never see that person again in your life...**

**Bring them into this cult of stat obsessions and incorrect decisions. Slowly watch them evolve from a person who has never heard the term ""PPR"" in their entire life, into someone who obsessively does mock drafts at 2am, three weeks before their league actually drafts. We need MORE among our ranks. The Fantasy Football Gods demand we SPREAD, INFECT, and CONSUME.**

But also, it's like really fun to teach someone you care about a passion of yours, and to connect with them through it. I hope [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zvubggYPxSgtjFaPIRLVthTRMs6Szt-Ce8JZJHRuO-4/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) finds you, and whoever you show it to, well. ❤",9,1756694192.0,fantasyfootball,4,0.91,False

1n5d1xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1n5d1xg/what_is_at_the_core_of_fear_of_wasting/,What is at the core of fear of wasting?,"When I was a kid I drew a kid-drawing of our house and trees and the sun and whatever on a piece of paper. I don't remember if I showed it to my parents or not but I was quite delighted with it, so I glued it to the headboard of my bed. It was clean, coated wood, and later on (the next day maybe, or later, I don't know) I decided to take it off, and the glue and paper had ruined the wood, and I tried so hard to clean it and remove the meshed-in paper and glue and it just wouldn't come off, and I cried so much that night because I felt I had ruined something beautiful (the bed); that I wasted something. 

This is my earliest memory of this feeling. I was no older than 7 or 8. Today I caught myself tearing up when I thought about the food we waste and throw away. This is recurrent in my life. I cry everytime it hits me deep that I have wasted something of my own like time and opportunities, and things of others as well. I have no idea where to place this in my psychology, and why it hurt me so much as a child to do something so childish and inconsequential.

I don't want to just throw this on my parents as well. I'm sure my dad never cared about such things, but perhaps mom always had special items in the house we had to practice the utmost care with, and this is somehow related. As I am writing this, another emotion behind this lament of wasting something, is feeling like a burden. As long as I can remember, I viewed myself as: I must always add something, not detract. Always give, not take.

The opposite of this is that as a teenager, I liked to destroy stuff. Like once I took out an old tv to the garage and beat it to pieces with a bat. It was not a reaction, it wasn't emotional, I calmly did all of that after the decision came to my mind. Another time whule having an important fight with my dad, I slapped the coffee table with my palm once with intention to break it. It was thick glass with wooden legs. It didn't break. I smacked it again harder, and it broke. Later I said I didn't mean to, I was angry and it was a mistake, but my mom said: I saw you, you clearly wanted to break that glass.

Similar events have taken place since then —but much further in between— where I am extremely calm and still while in a flight or flight state (even in fights) and I have a clear intention of ""breaking something"".

My more hidden parts believe I am enough as I am, neigh, my mere presence is a blessing to those around me. This is my superficial shadow and it's egotistical. But in my conscious mind, I really want to go above and beyond to always give more than I take from anyone in my life. This is exhausting, and also, unsustainable, as when someone is kinder and a better friend or potential partner than me, I push them away. It also means I struggle to accept kindness.

Could this all really go back to such moments in my childhood that I was scolded for or warned not to break something? Could it be that simple? And could the drawing thing have stunted my creativity, as I am so averse to drawing as an adult.

1n5czck,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5czck,Do you cigar smoking self a favor…,"…and please go buy this cigar! It is the Padrón Black PB-97 Maduro. If you enjoy a Padrón cigar -really, any of their sticks - you will find the purchase to be a wise purchase. I say “wise” because it *is* spendy at ~$40. But that money spent should bring much added enjoyment to your cigar ritual.

The initial light is pretty spicy, not gonna lie. But after a few puffs, this will go away and be replaced by a creamy nuttiness (walnuts for me) and a slightly, but not forward, earthy flavor.

These flavors continued until about halfway through when the nuttiness essentially went away and was replaced with a wonderful, very bold black coffee flavor that, for me, made me almost want to smoke faster to keep this flavor in my mouth. No dirty ashtray mouth with this cigar. The ash stayed really white throughout and it burned like one would hope a ~$40 cigar would, all the way to the end, as you can see. 

This was a two hour smoke that I was sad to be done with. It’s crazy, but I think of all the money I’ve wasted on expensive, “meh” Davidoffs when I could have been buying these. I’m a dummy. 🙂

The Wild World of Beta Testing With ZERO Experience!,"Okay—can someone explain to me how I JUST found out people online are basically getting PAID TO TEST APPS?   
Like, apps BEFORE they're even published??  
Where have I been?!  

I thought you had to be some kind of code wizard or have a resume the size of a novel.  
Spoiler: apparently, you can get started with *no* experience.  
Not even joking.

Here’s what I’m piecing together about how these so-called ""Beta Tester"" jobs work.  
You sign up, companies send you their apps to test, and you literally just… try them.  
Write up what broke or annoyed you.  
Sometimes I do this for FREE using my real apps, so why am I only now learning you can get paid for it?  

**Getting started is WAY less scary than I imagined:**  
- ~~No fancy tech skills needed (trust me, I’m just as shocked)~~  
- ~~No degree, no interview trauma!!~~  
- Just your phone, some focus, and the ability to answer honest questions  
- Sign up on pages like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**   

Here’s the usual process:
- Register with your email (easy)  
- Pick the types of apps you actually enjoy using  
- Wait for a notification from **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
- Cautiously open the test app and follow the steps  
- Click, tap, (break?) the app  
- Give your feedback (seriously, don’t sugarcoat it, the bugs are what they want)  
- Get PAID through PayPal or other easy peasy methods

And the cash?  
Okay, don’t expect to retire, but some jobs pay a few dollars just to run through a game.  
Multiply that by a few apps as a side gig, and, huh, suddenly your coffee addiction is funded.

A few DOs and DON’Ts...  
- **DO** check your email spam filter so you don’t miss notifications  
- **DO** make your feedback super detailed – like ""this button crashed my phone LOL,"" not just ""it’s good""  
- **DO** sign up at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (seriously, this site is just always popping up)  
- **DON’T** lie about issues or post the beta app details elsewhere – it’s NDA city  
- **DON’T** expect to get rich, but wow, if you want bragging rights for using apps before your friends… it’s a win

I’m honestly shocked that ANYONE can do this.  
If you’re lazier than a cat, this might actually be your dream side hustle.  
All you need: WiFi and some curious thumbs.

And if you want the receipts, literally just try it yourself—right here:  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Has anyone else here had luck with Beta Tester gigs?  
Share your low-key secrets and what the wildest bug you’ve found has been!

• 2-4 double shots a day, 80% milk based. Currently not entertaining guests but might in the future.

• Wanting to experiment more (light roasts, flow profiles, pre infusion)

• ECM Mechanika Max with flow control ($2,125, w/Pressensor group sensor & Brewista X scale, per WLL labor day sale) or Profitec MOVE ($2,125)

• OR Refurbished Mechanika Max without flow control ($1,598) or Profitec Pro 300 ($1,625) PLUS upgrading my current grinder (Gaggia MDF 55)

I guess it's the dual boiler vs heat exchanger question. 

I'm upgrading I've started noticing how some of my shots taste better than others on my Gaggia and I'd like more control over the consistency as well as an opportunity to experiment more.

I originally got my Gaggia as a low entry investment into home coffee to see if I actually used it everyday and I have! My lattes are better than Starbucks and my setup already paid for itself. I thought of modding my machine but I got a bonus so I thought I'd treat myself.

So I know dual boilers are better for temperature stability and whatnot but I like the idea of more experimentation that the E61 group head offers with flow control plus the rotary pump seems to offer more durability and I'd definitely would plumb it in. I also appreciate the auto on feature. Now with the temperature stability, I know in numbers it can't match a dual boiler but would I actually be able to taste said difference? Could that be why my Gaggia's shots taste different? Would I have the same problem again? I'd be going from no PID control whatsoever to some control, I guess.

I like the Profitec MOVE because of the dual boilers and I'm very appreciative of the bottomless portafilter included in the latter. The auto on, programmable brew cycles and pre-infusion sound great. The included wooden accents don't hurt either. 

The Pro 300 is my poor man's MOVE I guess but I could solve the auto on with a smart plug, no luck on pre infusion, though. It has a PID so temperature stability will be solved and maybe my shots would all taste around the same which would solve my ""problem""?

1n5cry1,https://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1n5cry1/longterm_camping_advice_needed_winter_weather_and/,Long-term camping advice needed -- winter weather and bears,"I am looking for some advice about camping long-term in a cold climate. I'll start with some background info. If you're not interested in those details, please skip ahead to the ""advice needed"" section.

**Background**: My husband and I just bought some undeveloped property in Michigan. We're planning to build a cabin and live there full-time, but first, we need to clear a space to build our home and a path to get supplies and equipment up there. The property is accessed via a half mile of unpaved easement road, much of which is overgrown with tall grass and raspberry bushes.

I was recently laid off, so I decided I would start working on the property while my husband goes to his job. We currently live a few hours away, so my plan is to camp on the property for a week or so at a time, get some work done, and come home for a break when he has his days off. I just completed my first week-long stint of this. I'd been planning on ten days, but had to quit early because I injured my hand, and also because I completely underestimated the weather in the Upper Peninsula. I knew it gets cold there, but I did not expect nighttime temperatures to dip into the low 30s in August!

The other main obstacle is that I cannot drive a vehicle more than halfway up the easement road. When I tried this, I ended up getting my car stuck in the mud and had to call a tow truck. And then the tow truck also got stuck and had to call a second tow truck. So, until we are able to dig some drainage ditches and put down gravel, there is no chance of getting any large vehicles onto our property, including campers, RVs, etc.

That has also presented a problem for food storage. There's a lot of interesting wildlife in the Upper Peninsula, including black bears, coyotes, wolves, bobcats, and (maybe) [mountain lions](https://mountainlion.org/2025/04/12/have-mountain-lions-finally-recolonized-michigan/). I have 100% seen evidence of black bears on my property, in the form of scat and shredded up tree trunks. I'm also pretty sure I heard a bobcat on my second night there (though I'm way less worried about bobcats than I am about bears). With that in mind, I have been careful not to leave food around my campsite. Last week, I was storing everything in my car in sealed containers. I also tried to stick with foods that don't have a very strong smell. I brought dried rice, beans, and flour for making bread, and all of it was in sealed containers, which I kept in a plastic storage bin. This definitely felt like the safest system, and I didn't end up having any problems with hungry bears. But it also really sucked to have to hike half a mile every time I wanted a meal (or even to brush my teeth, since I also locked up all my toiletries), especially after a day of heavy manual labor, or even worse, when I was freezing cold in the morning and desperate for a hot cup of coffee. And if I took too long to cook supper at night, I was then faced with the unpleasant task of hiking alone in the dark, which probably felt a lot more dangerous than it actually was, but was scary nonetheless.

**Advice needed**: I am looking for a cold weather tent that I can put a wood stove in, and for some kind of storage locker to keep my food safe from bears.

For the tent, someone I met in the UP suggested I could get a yurt. The one he suggested looks nice and it's not too expensive, but it's made of canvas, I'm worried about how cloth will hold up in rain. It looks like a lot of the hot tents on the market are made of canvas. Is that better than nylon? Does it hold up well in wet weather? I'm able to take the tent down and wait out any really serious storms in my car, or even go to a hotel if it's that bad. I also know that some amount of damp is just part of camping, and I'm prepared with a change of clothing that I'll keep in the car, and plastic containers for storing my belongings. But I don't want to get completely soaked every time it rains.

For food storage, I would really like something I can keep a little closer to my campsite. It doesn't need to be in my tent, or even within 100 feet of my tent. I just don't want to have to keep hiking all the way up the road to my car. I know there are storage lockers specifically meant to be bear-resistant, but they are pretty expensive and I'm on a tight budget. I've seen the bear-proof canisters hikers use, but those are too small to store ten days of food for myself and my dog. I tried to find a decent tree near my campsite to hang a bear bag, but the trees around that part of the property are pretty small. Would a heavy-duty plastic cargo container be sufficient?

And hopefully this won't be much of a concern at all, with all the racket I'll be making using a weed wacker and other power tools.

I have an almost 7yo, almost 3yo, and an 8month old. My husband works long hours, 6 days a week so I’m home by myself a lot of the time. My 3yo is insanely naughty. He bites, hits, kicks, and lets out this high pitched long scream over and over any time he doesn’t get his way. He also gets super frustrated easily if the things in his life don’t match up to his expectations. For example his cars not sitting the right way on the coffee table but he can’t get them to sit the way he wants them to, sets him off. If his blanket isn’t perfectly straight and we can’t help him in the car because we’re driving, it sends him into a thrashing screaming fit for the rest of the drive. But he also delights in watching us scramble. Just now I accidentally turned around while I was getting everyone inside and he ran in and locked the screen door so we were all locked out. He just sat there and laughed while we were all scrambling trying to get him to unlock it. I finally had to dig in my car and bribe him with chocolate. He will also push, kick, and pull his sister’s hair, all while laughing. 

I’ve tried time outs, sit ins, distractions, and just about everything to get him to stop, but all those things seem to do is make it worse and he just screams and thrashes. He used to bang his head on the floor, but now he’s resorted to the other things mentioned, or biting his hands or hitting his face. I’m losing my mind and don’t know what to do and at this point I’m just trying to keep everyone safe. I try and remove him and give him alternate ways to release steam like hitting pillows and such, but that doesn’t do much and he just ends up kicking me instead while I’m talking. Is this normal behavior? I don’t remember my daughter being this way, but she was an only child for 4 years. I try and give him so much attention and love, so I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Am I just having a hard time coping? ",2,1756692938.0,toddlers,3,1.0,False

1n5cmvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1n5cmvo/best_course_of_action_relationship_advice/,Best course of action? relationship advice.,"To start off, Me M24 and my ex M24, that were together for 2.5 years, met while we were in college during our senior year. I had just moved back home from studying abroad and planned to move back once I graduated to continue on with a masters degree. Knowing this, Of course, as one does, I got bored and downloaded tinder in January of 2023. It was obviously mindless swiping until someone caught my eye, we matched and decided to hangout, I went over to his apartment at a different college and we obviously hooked up but after, instead of leaving, we got to know eachother and actually ended up really liking eachother. As time went on, about 3 months later he asked me to be his boyfriend; I accepted and was hoping we could try for long distance but he said he wouldn’t do it….. fast forward to summer and he ends up meeting all my friends, my entire family, as do I, we headed to his family’s beach house at times, visited my friends at their beach houses and had a great time. At the end of the summer i decided to try to give us a break in order for me to settle into a new life abroad…. he didn’t like that and basically didn’t let us breakup but I clearly wasn’t opposed to staying together either. He ended up visiting every 2-3 months which was great, I was living in a beautiful and extremely iconic european city getting a masters degree and working in fashion. I always felt some sort of resentment that we couldn’t just be together all the time or try to make it happen so I asked him to try and find a way to move in with me for the summer. As life lines everything up in our favor, his professor was from my country in europe and had connections to have him do some medical research there as an intern. I was working in fashion and he was doing medical research in anyone’s dream city. However, it wasn’t too great honestly, we had many many many arguments and even basically broke up a couple times there, however, we always ended up back together. Towards the end of the summer we headed to Italy to meet my family there; this trip was insanely great for us, I never felt more love for him. However, the night before was so bad he almost flew completely back to the USA for good. Anyways, I end up moving back to the USA in 2025. I was stressed at the fact that I had to leave my dream city + friends + community i had built there, left my dream career, lost all freedom as I live with my parents until i can get on my feet again, and had just gotten a puppy which was a bit stressful + happy. Basically, there was a lot of bickering and there was things he was into that i genuinely didn’t care about just as he had things i was into that he didn’t care about but I didn’t really care, I had my friends to talk about that stuff and he did too so I didn’t ever really feel the need for him to be so into it but he really didn’t like that i wasn’t into his passion. He also just turned me off a lot when we lived together because it felt like I was the mother of the house, food would never get made before i was home, cleaning didn’t occur unless i pushed for it, no plans would be made unless i thought of something….. All in all, we had great times but we also had really bad times. At some points we spoke about marriage, kids, our business interests, etc. I ended up ending our relationship in May of 2025 because of this built up tension and, 2 days before, he mentioned that he resented me. In my mind, you should never, ever even let that come to mind with the person you love and that hurt me a lot.

After the breakup, I felt completely fine, barely even thought about it tbh. Come June of 2025 and I’m heading back to europe for my graduation ceremony, I’m excited but slowly am worried the city will cause me to think about him more and cause me to breakdown. Just as I expected, everything from the metro, the bakery, our go to restaurant, our go to bar, our old friends, everything reminded me of him. One specific night while I was out to dinner with my family before meeting some friends to go out, I decided to check his location (we never stopped sharing it) and I saw he was in Boston; I had just looked at instagram and had seen Boston Pride was going on, however, that’s not him and it seriously threw my for a loop that he may have met someone leading him down into honestly kinda being a slut which is not him AT ALL….I ended up basically freaking out at him over text and saying so many things I regret; turns out, he was studying with his friend for his final exams at medical school. I had completely forgotten that his friend went to school in Boston. I apologised deeply and we said we could just talk later. That night, I met a longtime friend at a rooftop and was guzzling down Martinis, we met another friend and headed to my dive bar gay club where there’s shower shows. We had an amazing time and I actually ended up meeting a very very handsome scottish model, we were making out all night as I was just trying to distract from coming back to a reality where the breakup begins to hurt. Fast forward to me coming back home. I end up getting on a call with him where i’m basically realising where I went completely wrong and begging for him back. He was crying on the call and apologised but said no and it was firm. It hurt a lot but this truly made me realise how much he means to me and how big of a part of my life he was and how much I want US in the end. Multiple of these scenarios have been playing out over the summer. Around July, my dad kinda reminded me that I need to go out and see friends and not rot at home crying about the breakup so that’s what I did, I forgot I had friends during all this and booked myself until the rest of the summer across the northeast. I was going out in Boston, Newport, New York City, etc. having the time of my life and was finally being able to kinda tuck it into the back of my mind, until I couldn’t anymore. One night while I was out in NYC, we ended up hitting up Playhouse bar in Hell’s kitchen. My friend set me up with a guy and he was cute, I was into it, until, all of a sudden, It all came rushing back to me at once and I thought to myself, “i can’t do this to him, to us” and basically start bawling my eyes out and running outside that club. I was inconsolable, my friend was helping me trying to comfort me but I just couldn’t get him and us out of my mind, like this isn’t over, it can’t be over yet, it feels undone. I ended up trying to call him maybe 30 times with texts following up as well as my friend calling him and leaving him a voicemail. Obviously, he wasn’t answering as it was 4am. We end up going back to my friends and passing out.

Let me just say that waking up the next morning felt like the world was caving onto me. The minute I woke up, he calls me, I don’t answer, he text me “hey i’m worried about you, are you okay?” I don’t answer, he calls me friend and she doesn’t answer either. I was extremely hungover and knew that atleast we kinda had to talk now after last night so I decided I’d get coffee, go home and call him once i’m settled back in. I get back home and I finally call him; I won’t go into too much detail as it was an extremely intimate call but the main point was that I switched the goal of what I was asking of him. Instead of begging for us to get back together I framed it more as like I needed him, I want him, etc. I don’t want to get back together and fall into the same dynamic but instead build something new; “why don’t we hangout? it’s harmless and I miss you” he ends up agreeing to it and I see him that next Sunday.

This was the most intense meeting I’ve ever had with a guy, it felt like a first date, butterflies in my stomach, nervousness. I buy him a coffee at the shop we met at, he gets in my car and he brought me my favorite snack. That gave me a little bit of hope; it was honestly a very sweet meeting and we had a great time and he also got to express himself to me in person. He basically was saying that at this point he’s doing great and finding himself again; what we both realised through talking this through was that we both let ourselves get too absorbed into the relationship and neglected everything else which was also one of our downfalls; instead of begging for us to get back together, I mentioned how we don’t have to to that, we could start by talking at first and rebuilding a new and healthier dynamic while keeping our individuality. It was great honestly and very constructive. We went on a nature walk which was a scene straight out of call me by your name but there was a point where he asked me “why me? why now?” to which I responded “no one deserves the love i have to give, but you, no one I’ve met in my life has impacted me and taught me so much; I can see our future. It’s a matter of choosing eachother and I choose you in every lifetime.” There was a lot of hugging, me giving him neck kisses, hand holding, we even went and played some soccer together for a bit.

All in all, at the end of our meeting, he just blurted out “we need a completely fresh start” which just changed the game completely. Instead of a hard no, it was was now a, let’s start from 0. He had mentioned he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was sorry he couldn’t give me what I want but I reassured him that I want him and I love him and that if this is what it’s going to take to have us be successful in the long term, then i’m willing to do this. He mentioned we don’t tell anyone as to not have outside pressure at all, which I think is healthy.

Basically, it’s been a week since then and it’s mostly been me wishing him a good day, asking about his exams, and just general chatter which is what I should expect I guess. This upcoming weekend i’m heading up to boston and am driving through his town so i’m stopping by and getting us some lunch which i’m excited for.

TL;DR

I was with my boyfriend for 2.5 years, we met in college, lived abroad together, traveled together, and were very close. We loved eachother but ended up getting into many heated arguments which led to me finally calling it quits. A month after I got cold feet and basically started begging for him back; he said he’s doing good and feels fine being alone for now and he’s not up for it. After a couple of months we’ve decided to start talking again. Not sure where to go from here or how to treat this new situation.",1,1756692748.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

1n5ciyv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5ciyv,L'acte final or the first 3 squares I've in a day in years,"For dinner I ate most of the rest ration. I left the rest of the biscuits and tea and coffee. It was getting late to drink those. This was the chicken couscous, chicken noodle soup, a pack of salt crackers, apricot jam, the fruit jelly bar, chocolate bar, the semolina cake and the little cakes and the strawberry mint sports drink. 

Let me start with the easiest thing. The strawberry mint sports drink is absolute ass. I ended up dumping it down the drain. Not everything can be a winner. The next thing are the steamed cakes. If you don't consume alcohol for whatever reason then these are definitely not for you. They're soaked in rum. Now onto the good part.

The chicken noodle soup is a solid instant soup. I did boiling water in my coffee mug and let it sit for about 6 minutes or so. It was very good. The only issue was that the noodles basically disintegrate in it. Otherwise good chicken flavor and it's a 7/10. The chicken couscous was amazing. I heated it the same way as the salmon. This was couscous with chickpeas and other vegetables and included chicken and sausage. Absolutely magnificent main. Again it just need a little salt. Personally I'd rather an under salted dish than something that's a salt bomb. 9/10 for me. 

The little cakes are a steamed pudding rather than a cake and are absolutely drenched in rum syrup and contain rum. There was no juice in the can but they didn't need it. They're dense. I've never really had steamed pudding before so it went rather well. A bit strong on the rum but I'm up to the task. 8/10 for me. The last was the semolina cake but it's also not a cake. More of a flan. It had a lovely caramel flavor (I don't really like caramel) with a smooth texture that almost melts in the mouth. 

Overall this menu (sports drink being the exception) was a 9/10 and I highly recommend it. Well done France, well done. ",7,1756692422.0,MRE,2,1.0,False

I dont have one yet, just window shopping and theorizing.  I would like to make it a bioactive enclosure so I dont have to do so much cleaning or switch out all the substrate of such a large enclosure. Also I think live plants would be nice.

 I have recently gotten into composting. I wonder if a homemade compost would help the plants, be safe for the snakes enclosure, and also might help break down snake poops more quickly? Right now my compost bin gets cardboard, kitchen scraps, grass clippings, and occasionally some leaves. When it is done though, it obviously won't look like any of that stuff. It will be completely broken down and earthy. No pesticides, no chemicals; just totally decomposed plant/vegetable/coffee ground stuff. 

So Im just looking for ideas. Has anyone tried adding compost on top of your snake substrate or mixing it in? Or totally replacing substrate with compost? Any special restrictions for what can and cannot be added to the compost if I later use it for this kind of purpose? Risks in doing this? Am I being crazy?

Chapter 1
The steady beep of the heart monitor had become the rhythm of my days. I sat beside my grandmother's hospital bed at Seattle General, her papery hand cool within mine. The antiseptic smell of the room couldn't mask the scent of the small potted lavender I'd brought—her favorite.
Grandma Margaret's eyes fluttered open, revealing those familiar blue irises now clouded with pain medication. Even in her weakened state, her first concern was for me.
""Has Marcus called?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible above the machines keeping her alive.
I swallowed hard, forcing a smile. ""He's still away on that business trip, Grandma. Reception's spotty where he is.""
The lie tasted bitter on my tongue. My husband had been unreachable for nearly a month now, his absence a gaping wound during the time I needed him most. Still, I protected Grandma from this truth—her heart was fragile enough.
""Natalie, my sweet girl,"" she murmured, her fingers twitching weakly against mine. ""Promise me something.""
""Anything,"" I whispered, leaning closer.
""Don't let anger poison your heart. Not against anyone. Not even Marcus.""
Something in her tone made me pause. Had she sensed the truth about my marriage despite my careful façade?
""Grandma, what do you—""
""Love is precious,"" she continued, each word clearly costing her effort. ""But so is your worth. Remember that.""
I nodded, tears blurring my vision as I pressed my lips to her knuckles. ""I promise.""
We sat in silence after that, the words between us unnecessary after a lifetime together. She had been my only real parent after my own had abandoned me, her modest home my only stability. Everything I knew about love and sacrifice, I'd learned from watching her tend her garden and care for others in our working-class neighborhood.
Hours later, as the evening shadows lengthened across the hospital room, her breathing changed. The monitor's steady rhythm faltered, then flatlined into a single, continuous tone. I didn't call for the nurses immediately. Instead, I held her hand against my cheek one last time, memorizing the feel of her skin against mine.
""Goodbye, Grandma,"" I whispered. ""I'll make you proud.""
* * *
The funeral home smelled of chemical preservatives poorly masked by artificial floral scents. I stood alone, arranging white lilies around the simple wooden box that would soon hold my grandmother's ashes. The funeral director had been kind but businesslike when I'd explained my situation—that I'd had to borrow money for even this modest cremation.
""We can set up a payment plan for the remainder,"" he'd offered gently.
I'd nodded, too numb to feel the full weight of more debt. What was another financial burden when my heart felt hollowed out?
My fingers trembled as I positioned the last lily. Tears splashed onto the pristine petals, and I made no effort to wipe them away.
""I'll take care of your garden,"" I promised the empty room, my voice breaking. ""I'll nurture everything you loved. The herbs, the flowers—I won't let them wither.""
The words felt like a lifeline, something to cling to in the void of her absence. My grandmother had always said that caring for growing things was a way of caring for the soul. Now, it would be my connection to her.
* * *
The day after the burial, I wandered downtown Seattle in a daze. I hadn't meant to end up in the shopping district—my empty bank account made that a cruel joke—but something about the gleaming storefronts distracted me from the hollow ache in my chest.
I paused outside Tiffany & Co., my reflection ghostly in the polished glass. Inside, diamonds caught the light, transforming it into rainbow prisms that seemed to mock my grief with their brilliance.
That's when I saw them.
Marcus—my husband, supposedly unreachable for weeks—stood at the counter with Victoria Whitmore, the wealthy heiress whose surrogacy program he'd supposedly joined to help pay for Grandma's medical bills. His arm was wrapped intimately around her waist as a sales associate presented a stunning diamond necklace.
Time seemed to slow as Marcus lifted the glittering piece from its velvet cushion. With practiced tenderness—the same tenderness he'd once shown me—he draped it around Victoria's elegant neck. Their eyes met in the mirror, sharing a private smile that spoke of long familiarity.
Then he leaned in and pressed his lips to her cheek, his hand possessively at the small of her back.
The blood rushed from my face as reality crashed down around me. While I had been burying my grandmother with borrowed money, scraping together enough for even the simplest farewell, my husband had been shopping for diamonds with another woman.
I stumbled backward, bumping into a passerby who muttered an irritated ""Watch it!"" But I barely heard them. My entire world had just shattered like the glass displays that now separated me from the truth of my marriage.

Chapter 2
I don't remember the walk home. Somehow my feet carried me back to our Capitol Hill apartment, each step heavier than the last. The image of Marcus draping that diamond necklace around Victoria's neck played on repeat in my mind, a grotesque film I couldn't shut off.
Our apartment—once a sanctuary of what I thought was love—now felt like an elaborate stage set. The secondhand furniture we'd picked together at thrift stores, the patched throw blanket I'd mended countless times, the struggling herbs on our windowsill—all props in a performance I hadn't known I was part of.
I sat on our worn sofa in the dark, waiting. The urn containing Grandma's ashes sat on the coffee table, the only witness to my unraveling world.
When the key finally turned in the lock, I didn't move. Marcus entered with the casual confidence of a man with nothing to hide, tossing his keys into the bowl by the door. He flicked on the light and startled slightly at the sight of me sitting motionless in the shadows.
""Jesus, Nat. Why are you sitting in the dark?"" His voice carried the same warmth I'd fallen for years ago. How had I never heard the hollowness beneath it?
""I saw you today,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady. ""At Tiffany's. With Victoria.""
Something shifted in his expression—not guilt or shame, but something colder. The mask he'd worn for years slipped, revealing a stranger's face.
""So?"" he asked, his tone suddenly flat.
The single syllable hit me like a physical blow. Not denial. Not excuses. Just... indifference.
""So?"" I echoed, disbelief rising in my throat. ""I buried my grandmother yesterday, Marcus. With borrowed money. While you were buying diamonds for another woman.""
He sighed, as if my pain was an inconvenience. Then, with deliberate slowness, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a thick wad of cash. He tossed it onto the coffee table next to Grandma's urn. The bills scattered, some sliding against the ceramic container that held all I had left of the woman who'd raised me.
""There,"" he said, his lip curling slightly. ""That should cover it. Plus a little extra for your... services.""
The word hung in the air between us, ugly and explicit.
""My services?"" I whispered.
""Come on, Natalie."" His voice dripped with contempt I'd never heard before. ""Let's not pretend anymore. You've been useful. A convenient wife from the wrong side of the tracks. Poor little Natalie with her sad story and her dying grandmother."" He gestured dismissively at the urn. ""Do you know how good that made me look? How it fed my reputation?""
Each word stripped away another layer of the life I thought I'd been living. I stared at this man—my husband—suddenly seeing him clearly for the first time.
""You never loved me,"" I said, the realization crystallizing as I spoke it.
""Love?"" He laughed, the sound brittle and cruel. ""I had a savior complex, Natalie. I liked rescuing you. Watching you look up at me with those grateful eyes."" He leaned closer, his handsome face twisted with disdain. ""But love? You were a project. A charity case. Nothing more.""
The room seemed to tilt around me. I gripped the edge of the sofa, trying to anchor myself as my marriage disintegrated before my eyes.
""While my grandmother was dying..."" I began, my voice breaking.
""While your grandmother was dying,"" he interrupted coldly, ""I was in the Maldives with Victoria. Planning our real future.""
Something inside me snapped. I lunged for his laptop on the side table, flipping it open before he could stop me. His password—my birthday, a detail that once seemed romantic—unlocked a treasure trove of betrayal.
There they were: Marcus and Victoria on a pristine beach, her arms wrapped around his neck, both of them laughing into the camera. The date stamp confirmed what he'd just admitted—these moments of joy had been captured while I sat alone beside my grandmother's hospital bed, believing my husband was working extra shifts to help pay for her care.
I looked up from the screen to find Marcus watching me with cold amusement, as if my pain was a mildly interesting spectacle.
""You're pathetic,"" he said softly. ""You always were.""

Chapter 3
I sat on the floor, still reeling from Marcus's cruel words. The scattered bills lay where he'd thrown them, a few touching Grandma's urn. His footsteps had faded down the hallway, leaving me alone with the ruins of what I'd thought was my life.
The sudden pounding at the door startled me. Before I could rise, it swung open violently.
Victoria Whitmore stood in the doorway, her slender figure silhouetted against the hallway light. The diamond bracelet on her wrist caught the light as she stepped inside uninvited, her Louboutin heels clicking against the hardwood floors I'd scrubbed on hands and knees.
""So this is where Marcus has been slumming it,"" she said, her gaze sweeping dismissively over our apartment. ""Charming little... hovel.""
I rose shakily to my feet, wiping tears from my face. ""Get out.""
""Oh, honey."" She toyed with her diamond bracelet, twisting it around her wrist. ""I just wanted to see the charity case for myself. The little project Marcus has been so... entertained by.""
She moved through our living room like she was touring a museum of poverty, her manicured finger trailing over surfaces, checking for dust. When she reached the coffee table, she paused, looking at Grandma's urn.
""Is this the famous grandmother?"" She picked it up, examining it with exaggerated curiosity.
""Put that down,"" I said, my voice breaking. ""Please.""
She met my eyes, a cruel smile playing on her perfectly painted lips. Then, with deliberate slowness, she tilted the urn. I lunged forward, but it was too late. The ashes—my grandmother's remains—spilled across the coffee table and onto the floor.
""Oops,"" she said flatly.
I dropped to my knees, desperately trying to gather the ashes, my hands trembling so badly I could barely function. Tears blurred my vision as I scooped what I could back into the urn.
""It's just dust anyway,"" Victoria said, watching my desperation with clinical interest. ""Like your marriage.""
She reached into her designer handbag and pulled out a folder, tossing it beside me. Photos spilled out—digitally altered images of an elderly woman who resembled my grandmother, dated from the past week.
""She's not even dead, you know. Marcus told me all about your little scam."" Victoria twisted her bracelet again. ""Pretending your grandmother was dying to get sympathy—and money. How pathetic.""
I stared at the photos in horror, recognizing the cruel manipulation. ""These are fake. My grandmother is gone. I was with her when she died.""
""Sure you were."" Victoria's laugh was like breaking glass. ""Keep telling yourself that.""
* * *
Two days later, I found myself at the Seattle Women's Foundation charity gala. I hadn't planned to attend—the invitation had come weeks ago, when I still believed in my marriage—but something in me needed to be somewhere, anywhere but that apartment with its ghost of spilled ashes and shattered dreams.
I wore my only formal dress, a simple black sheath I'd found on clearance years ago. Around me, Seattle's elite mingled in designer gowns and custom tuxedos, diamonds glittering under the ballroom's crystal chandeliers. I stood alone near a potted palm, nursing a glass of champagne I couldn't afford, seeking nothing but momentary escape.
Then the crowd parted, and there they were.
Marcus looked devastatingly handsome in a tuxedo I'd never seen before. Victoria clung to his arm in a red gown that probably cost more than our rent, the diamond necklace I'd seen him purchase gleaming at her throat. They moved through the crowd like royalty, accepting congratulations I couldn't hear over the buzzing in my ears.
I should have left. I should have turned and walked away. But I stood frozen, watching as Victoria took the microphone from the event chairwoman.
""I'd like to thank everyone for coming tonight,"" she began, her voice carrying effortlessly through the ballroom. ""And I'd especially like to thank my fiancé, Marcus Sterling, for his generous donation to the foundation.""
Fiancé. The word echoed in my head as the room erupted in applause. Marcus nodded smugly beside her, his hand possessively at her waist.
I stumbled backward, knocking into a waiter. Champagne glasses crashed to the floor, drawing all eyes to me. Through the sudden silence, I saw Marcus's expression change from smugness to something like alarm as he recognized me.
I turned and fled, pushing blindly through the crowd toward the exit. My heel caught on the plush carpet, and I fell hard, my body meeting the cold marble floor of the foyer. Pain shot through me as my lip split against the stone.
I tasted blood as I tried to rise, my vision swimming with tears and humiliation. Somewhere in the distance, I heard Victoria's laughter mingling with concerned murmurs from strangers.
As darkness edged my vision, one thought crystallized with perfect clarity: This wasn't just betrayal. This was destruction—deliberate, calculated, and complete.

She may have downplayed the butterflies, but even Ally couldn’t deny it. A spark was there.

Renee let the silence stretch just long enough to let the truth settle in. No teasing, no I-told-you-so’s. Just a little smirk and quiet “so… date number two?”

So I'm a (17m) who players game with people online, we have a server and spend most days just joking around. 3 months ago we started a minecraft server which lasted a month during the server my friend (15m), who i'll be calling Beans for the rest of this server was trying to ragebait and annoy my older brother (20m). Afterwards my brother has been refusing to do things with Beans since with some of my friends agreeing with my brother, I didn't want to stop hanging out with Beans and so did another one of my friends (16m) who I'll call Toast. This made it really akward to hang out as people who try to invite both of them and it would lead to more drama alongside this i had to listen to both my brother and Beans complain about the situation. In my group i was the only one trying to fix thier relationship or atleast make it so my brother wouldn't leave games if Beans was just in the lobby.

Fast forwards till 3 weeks ago and i decided to take a break from everything and went on a camping trip without my older brother. During that trip I had spoke to my dad about everything and also kept speaking about a camping trip my friend group had spoke about planning once. When i arrived home i found out the during the week i was gone ALL my friends except Beans, Toast and a friend (19 m) i'll call Tea had made a new group chat to hang out and plan out events, i'd also like to note Tea was invited and did join but while everyone was hanging out in the said group chat Tea was in a call with Beans and Toast playing roblox. As a response to this I deciced to block basically all of them and kick them from the main group chat.

One of my friends that i kicked but did not block who I'll call Coffee messaged me basically calling me childish for acting this way and said they thought i was a closer friend them my brother (this is important as my brother introduced me to most of my friend group, Beans is someone i invited to hang out with us), they went on to say how i was just pushing my own insecurites onto them alongside them saying that the new group chat wasn't to avoid Me, Beans and Toast but was because another one of my friends just wanted to make a group chat as they never had before. They also said only the creator could invite people and that the creator was also busy at a wedding. This really hurt me as i did like Coffee as a friend but we rarely hanged out and they had ignored the issues between my brother and Beans.

Reccently I've started talking to some of them again mainly because Tea and Toast still talk to them, but some of them have been telling me i overreacted and how i was being dramatic, also my brother has started to try and tolorate Beans which is a start (i don't know why but i do think its because of Tea but i'm unsure tho). Something i thought was really funny was that Coffee was straight up lying about how only the creator could invite people so they could of added us but CHOSE to not invite us.

My name is Koda. I don't have any friends unless you count some acquaintances I know through my boyfriend. I know why - it's because I am painfully shy. I can hold a conversation just fine, but when it comes to the initiation of ""hey, you're pretty cool, want to get coffee and also be my friend forever please i'm so alone"", that's where I fumble.

Things about me - I don't think I like small talk. That stage is so boring and it overwhelms me so that when we get to the deep, interesting talking stage, I feel too socially drained to continue the conversation.

Furthermore if I include the dispersion plate the screw isn't long enough and so I can't include it causing uneven distribution of the water. It also sits way below even the stock screen. 

So none of their claims of what it solves it actually solves for in my machine and they state it's for my machine.

My nickname is Tee (she/her). I am an Afrolesbian (that is to say, a Black lesbian). I’m 5’7 and have an average build. I’ve got a little pudge on me but I’ve been making progress in my weight loss journey!

Currently, I am a full time medical student (not nursing related though) and a full time healthcare worker. I enjoy helping others and this pursuit of my career goals will definitely pay off in the end for me.

I’m looking for a long term, online connection mainly, but if you’re located near or around the NYC area, that’s also great! Definitely not a requirement though. Eventually, (probably after I graduate college in two years) I’d like to meet up, but definitely not right now.

Some things about me:

• I’m a HUGE geek (anime, manga, video games, books)
• I’ve recently gotten into photography and floriography.
• I am vocally outspoken about current sociopolitical issues and the way they’re shaping our society and future.
• I am child free. I refuse to have children.
• I LOVEEEEE cats and hope to adopt two in the future.
• I’m a coffee fanatic.
• I don’t have much experience, but I am a sub and a bottom. I’m way too wound up from my job and every day life and I want to give up control and not have to think for a while. I cannot compromise on this.
• Sometimes I write introspectively about random topics that pop into my head.
• I have a strict sleep schedule, so more than likely I’ll be asleep after 22:00 / 10:00 PM EST, but I’ll always respond when I wake up.

I’d also like to get married in the future, but that’s a bridge to cross when we get there.

Some things I’m searching for in another:

• Must be between 24-35.
• I have no preference for femme or masc presentation.
• I also have no preference for height.
• Someone who identifies as a woman is strongly preferred, but open to enbies as well.
• A fellow lesbian/sapphic of color is strongly preferred.
• Fellow lesbian is strongly preferred, but all sapphics are welcome.
• MUST be a domme and a top (preferably a soft dom). I’m looking for someone with whom I’ll feel save enough to let go of the control and stress from the chaos of my every day life and busy schedule.
• MUST be childfree and have no kids. Someone lied to be about not having kids before and it did not end well.
• MUST be outspoken about sociopolitical issues (ie, Gaza, Sudan, Congo, reproductive rights, the current U.S. administration, etc). Saying you’re “not into politics” or finding out you actively support the oppressors is an automatic rejection of.
• Some patience. Again, I’ve never been in a relationship, so I may be awkward at first, but I’ll try my hardest to be devoted. All I ask is for patience and feedback in return.

I can share more details in the DMs! I look forward to hearing from you <3",3,1756690755.0,lesbianr4r,3,1.0,False

I typically have very clear skin. Occasionally I’ll get a pimple here and there, but it’s rarely anything crazy. I do have a history of problematic skin, but it’s been years since I’ve had issues. 

Recently I was diagnosed with PCOS (I’ve suspected for a while) and I am trying to regain a regular period so I can have a second baby. I had a good idea where to start (I don’t want to start birth control, so I am taking a different approach) because I have low progesterone/high testosterone, and periods that either never come or I’ll bleed for 14 days straight. So I am down to just one coffee per day, dialing back super intense exercise, 2 cups of spearmint tea per day, chamomile/lavender tea at night, no added sugar (I already do this though because I am type 1 diabetic), getting quality sleep, and taking Vitex to hopefully get some regular ovulation happening again. I also take the supplements I’ve been taking for years (fish oil, vitamin d, pre natal, magnesium, probiotic) 

I got my period, and so far so good. It’s following a normal period pattern so far, so I feel optimistic. HOWEVER, this last couple of weeks my skin is slowly getting worse. Not quite cystic acne, but definitely spots all over. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Not sure if it’s just normal period acne (which I also don’t typically have an issue with) or if I should be concerned! ",2,1756690727.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

So I'm a (17m) who players game with people online, we have a server and spend most days just joking around.  3 months ago we started a minecraft server which lasted a month during the server my friend (15m), who i'll be calling Beans for the rest of this server was trying to ragebait and annoy my older brother (20m). Afterwards my brother has been refusing to do things with Beans since with some of my friends agreeing with my brother, I didn't want to stop hanging out with Beans and so did another one of my friends (16m) who I'll call Toast. This made it really akward to hang out as people who try to invite both of them and it would lead to more drama alongside this i had to listen to both my brother and Beans complain about the situation. In my group i was the only one trying to fix thier relationship or atleast make it so my brother wouldn't leave games if Beans was just in the lobby. 

Fast forwards till 3 weeks ago and i decided to take a break from everything and went on a camping trip without my older brother. During that trip I had spoke to my dad about everything and also kept speaking about a camping trip my friend group had spoke about planning once. When i arrived home i found out the during the week i was gone ALL my friends except Beans, Toast and a friend (19 m) i'll call Tea had made a new group chat to hang out and plan out events, i'd also like to note Tea was invited and did join but while everyone was hanging out in the said group chat Tea was in a call with Beans and Toast playing roblox. As a response to this I deciced to block basically all of them and kick them from the main group chat.

One of my friends that i kicked but did not block who I'll call Coffee messaged me basically calling me childish for acting this way and said they thought i was a closer friend them my brother (this is important as my brother introduced me to most of my friend group, Beans is someone i invited to hang out with us), they went on to say how i was just pushing my own insecurites onto them alongside them saying that the new group chat wasn't to avoid Me, Beans and Toast but was because another one of my friends just wanted to make a group chat as they never had before. They also said only the creator could invite people and that the creator was also busy at a wedding. This really hurt me as i did like Coffee as a friend but we rarely hanged out and they had ignored the issues between my brother and Beans.

Reccently I've started talking to some of them again mainly because Tea and Toast still talk to them, but some of them have been telling me i overreacted and how i was being dramatic, also my brother has started to try and tolorate Beans which is a start (i don't know why but i do think its because of Tea but i'm unsure tho). Something i thought was really funny was that Coffee was straight up lying about how only the creator could invite people so they could of added us but CHOSE to not invite us. I haven't made an effort to try and talk to Coffee but i can't stop thinking about this i and i want to know if what i did was correct. ",2,1756690614.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

Lately, I can’t stop geeking out about the rise of NO CODE AUTOMATION. Seriously, it feels like we’re living in a tech magic era that’s slipping beneath too many people’s radars. Automation used to mean either big $$ for custom development or learning intimidating coding languages. Now? Anyone with an internet connection and a knack for Googling can automate chunks of their life or business!

Why am I so excited? Here’s some of the magic:

- Streamlining busywork so you don’t have to repeat the same boring tasks  
- Connecting apps that, until now, felt like they lived in different galaxies  
- Creating little “bots” that send you reminders—so your future self owes you a coffee  

That feeling you get when an automation zaps a spreadsheet update or copies files between clouds before you even click? That’s not just productivity. That’s freedom!

What keeps blowing my mind is just how much you can do without writing a single line of code. You can:

- Sync and filter contacts between platforms  
- Automatically back up photos and docs  
- Ping teammates in Slack when a customer submits a form  
- Remind yourself to buy milk at exactly the right moment  

The line between “I wish there was an app for that…” and “Let me just build that” is super thin now! No joke—your wildest workflows can probably exist with a blend of Zapier, Make (formerly Integromat), or even AI-enhanced tools like GPTApps. All point-and-click, drag-and-drop.

Here’s what really gets me going:  
No code changes who gets to be a creator. I’ve seen teachers setting up classroom rituals, founders rebuilding their CRMs, and hobbyists running entire marketplaces—all without hiring developers or learning JavaScript.

This isn’t just about efficiency for the big players. It’s about unlocking creativity for everyone:

- Messy, half-baked ideas can be LIVE in an afternoon  
- Experimentation feels safe—mistakes aren’t expensive  
- Small wins quickly snowball into big game-changers  

Now, is it perfect? Not at all. Sometimes connectors are clunky, documentation’s confusing, or a key app is missing. But wow, even with these hurdles, the possibilities are expanding crazy fast.

If you haven’t tried automating something personal or work-related yet, take that leap! Start simple. Automate just *one* thing—maybe your daily weather email or tracking your Netflix viewings. I promise, it’s addictive.

So, what’s YOUR favorite no code automation so far? Or the simplest tweak that made life so much better—let’s swap ideas and build a magic library together! 🚀

I went on a coffee date today with a guy and he was nice, but I found myself carrying 99% of the conversation. Of course I left room for him to talk and be reciprocal in the conversation, but after I’d ask him a question or ask about certain things in his life (hobbies, where he was from, his experience at our university since we wen to the same one), he give an incredibly brief answer and would just stare at me and we’d sit in silence for a bit. He would occasionally ask a question or start a topic, but for every 10 questions I asked, he would ask me 1 (if that). Now that I’m looking back on it, I even paid for everything and he didn’t say thank you 😂

I’m all for silence and feel no obligation to fill it, but when you’re on a date where you’re not doing an activity or eating, it can feel a little awkward when they aren’t really engaging in conversation. Before we left, we discussed possible plans to see a movie. And he texted me after and said he had great time talking. 

My question is, does this mean he’s not that interested? Or maybe I give off a friend vibe? I thought maybe I was being awkward or something and that’s why he wasn’t really speaking, but carrying a conversation for 3 hours was a little exhausting. 

Am I reading to far into this? I have a tendency to overthink, so I’d appreciate a guy’s perspective. Thanks ",4,1756689885.0,AskWomenNoCensor,9,1.0,False

​It began with the birds. Not with a cessation of their singing, but with an impossible, absolute silence where their sound should have been. I was in the city, standing on a crowded street corner, waiting for the light to change. A bus rumbled past, but its sound was… wrong. It was a visual event, a vibration I felt in my chest, but the roar of the engine was gone, replaced by a hollow void.
​Panic rippled through the crowd. A woman screamed, but her mouth opened and closed in silence. A man yelled, his face a mask of terror, but all I could hear was the frantic pounding of my own heart. The normal cacophony of the city—the distant sirens, the chatter of conversations, the clatter of a coffee cup dropped on the pavement—had simply ceased. It was as if the audio track of our world had been suddenly muted. People stared at each other, their eyes wide with incomprehension and growing fear. A young girl, her face contorted in a silent sob, pulled at her mother's hand, but no sound escaped her lips. The mother, equally terrified, was looking at a man across the street who was frantically tapping his phone screen, his expression a wordless plea for help.
​We were all trapped in a film of immense horror, watching the world move without its voice, our shared fear a palpable, unutterable thing. The city's rhythm, once a comforting hum, had become a terrifying, silent beat. It wasn't the end of the world, not yet. It was something far more chilling: the sound of reality itself beginning to unravel.",1,1756689538.0,Realityhglitches,0,1.0,False
