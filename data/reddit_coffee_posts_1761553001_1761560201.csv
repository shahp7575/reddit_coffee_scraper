Hi, I’m Kamil, a 34-year-old from Poland. I’m tall, a bit on the quiet side, and I probably smile more than I talk at first 😅. I love cooking, especially desserts 🥧, hiking, and enjoying cozy nights with good movies—horrors, thrillers, or anything that makes you want to hide behind a pillow. I’m a big, cuddly guy who’d rather bake you something sweet than send flowers.

I’m not the best at small talk, but I truly enjoy honest, warm conversations that feel natural. For me, one meaningful connection means more than a hundred short chats.

If you enjoy calm energy, bad jokes, and good food, don’t hesitate to say hi. Maybe we’ll make coffee together one day ☕🙂!

1ohajv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohajv8/piles_part_1/,Piles (part 1),"My wife “Audrey” and I have been together for five years and married just under one.  
Our life together has always been calm, comfortable. There was never anything strange about her. No quirks, no red flags. If anything, she was the most straightforward woman I’d ever known.

Audrey is smart, gentle, and unfailingly practical. She’s not the kind of person who wastes time on nonsense. She’s not silly, or scattered. Everything in her life has its place. That’s just who she is.

She doesn’t do spooky. Doesn’t even like Halloween. I tried getting her to watch *Poltergeist* with me our first October together and she bailed before the first act. Said she didn’t see the point in scaring yourself for fun. It’s just not her thing. Never has been.

She doesn’t do pranks. Doesn’t make jokes unless they’re dry and bookish. Doesn’t pull surprises, doesn’t leave messes. I can’t remember her ever being disorganized. If you asked me what Audrey’s most consistent trait was, I’d probably say: she keeps things tidy.

That’s important to understand.  
Because that’s why the piles didn’t make sense.

I don’t mean normal messes. I’m not talking about laundry or dishes or clutter. These were *intentional*. Piled *deliberately*. Things stacked in corners or behind furniture that I know neither of us had touched in weeks. Grocery bags, folded towels, old receipts, single shoes. At first I thought maybe she was sorting donations or digging through forgotten boxes, but she never mentioned it. She just… left them there.

The first one was small. A plastic grocery bag filled with folded napkins and a pair of gardening gloves. Nothing weird. But I remember seeing it in the corner by the radiator one morning before work and thinking, *Huh, that’s not like her.*

I thought maybe she’d gotten distracted. Or maybe she was just cleaning out a drawer and hadn’t finished. Either way, I didn’t say anything. We were both rushing that morning. I grabbed my coffee, kissed her goodbye, and forgot about it.

But the pile was still there the next day. And the day after that.  
And by the end of the week, it wasn’t the only one.

Two weeks ago I was leaving for work a little later than usual. I had an early Zoom meeting and didn’t need to rush downtown, so I made coffee in the quiet like always, tiptoeing around so I didn’t wake Audrey.

I was walking down the hallway toward the front door, sipping from my mug, phone in the other hand, when something caught my eye near the bottom of the stairs.

It was a pile.

Not one of the older ones. This one was new.

A stack of things layered like a child had arranged them. A folded blanket, two cans of tomato soup, one of her slippers, and a crumpled grocery bag stuffed with... I don’t even know. Junk, I guess. And right on top, like the cherry on a very unsettling sundae, was one of those long fake flower garlands we keep in the attic.

It wasn’t there last night. I would’ve seen it.

I took a few steps closer, trying not to spill my coffee as I leaned forward. That’s when I saw Audrey.

She was crouched behind the pile. Just... squatting there on the floor with her knees up under her chin. Her arms were wrapped tight around her legs and she was grinning at me over the top of the soup cans.

I nearly dropped my mug. I did spill a little on my shirt.

“Audrey,” I said, brushing at the coffee with my hand. “What the hell are you doing?”

She didn’t move. Didn’t say anything. Just kept smiling. Her hair was half in her face and I could see the whites of her eyes beneath it. Wide open. Barely blinking.

“You scared the crap out of me,” I added, trying to keep my voice light.

After a few seconds, she ducked her head behind the pile like a child playing hide and seek. I waited, expecting her to pop up again—but she didn’t.

By the time I reached the front door, she was gone.

I called out, “You’re a weirdo!” as I was about to step outside.

I heard her laugh from behind the pile.

It was weird. But not scary.  
Not yet.

By lunch, I’d already forgotten about it.  
And by the time I got home, she was her normal self again.

The pile near the stairs didn’t move. Not the rest of that day. Not the next. But I started to notice it more.

It just sat there. Still and silent. A cluster of unrelated junk—none of it valuable, none of it trash. Things that didn’t belong together, but somehow *looked* like they did. That was the weird part. It looked… arranged. Not stacked like someone cleaning, or organizing, but built. Like a display. Or a nest.

After a few days, I asked Audrey if she was going through old boxes. She looked up from her tea and shook her head.

“What boxes?” she asked.

I pointed toward the hallway. “The pile by the stairs.”

She frowned like she didn’t know what I was talking about.

“Oh,” she said after a moment. “Right. That.”

That was all she said. And then she changed the subject.

The next one showed up in the corner of the living room behind the armchair. I didn’t see her build it, didn’t hear her moving anything around. It was just *there* one morning, when I went to plug in my laptop charger. A lamp I hadn’t seen in years. Two mismatched boots. A plastic bowl with a cracked rim. On top of that, folded neatly, was one of my hoodies I thought I’d lost at work.

I picked it up, half-expecting her to yell at me from the kitchen—but she didn’t.

She didn’t even seem to notice I’d touched it.

Over the next week, the piles multiplied. Slowly. Quietly. But always at night.

One appeared inside the coat closet. Another behind the curtains in the dining room. A third one under the kitchen table.

A little *fuller*. And more deliberate.

Not messy.

Not random.

I found one behind the couch that had a tunnel through the middle—barely wide enough for a person to crawl through. I didn’t test it.

There were patterns to the objects. Always soft things near the bottom. Crumpled napkins. Dish towels. Wadded-up sheets. Then heavier items stacked on top of that. Books. Shoes. Cans. The occasional glass object nestled carefully into the top layers—like a cherry on a cake.

I didn’t know what to make of it.

I asked her once if she was in her nesting stage.

She smiled without showing her teeth and said, “Something like that.”

That was all.

The smell changed around that time, too.

It started faint. Like dust and plastic. Then stronger. Like cardboard soaked in old water. There was something warm and bitter in it, too—like the smell behind a thrift store or a school basement. I opened a few windows just to air things out, and when Audrey noticed, she quietly went behind me and shut them again. One by one.

She didn’t say anything.

She barely looked at me anymore.

I’d catch her standing near the piles sometimes. Not doing anything. Not even adding to them. Just… staring. Hands at her sides, head slightly tilted. I never heard her speak to them, but the way she looked at them… it was almost reverent. Like they were meant for something. Like she was waiting.

Sometimes I’d see her standing too still. In the middle of the hallway or behind a doorway. Half in shadow. Her arms tight to her sides. Chin slightly lifted. Like a doll someone had forgotten to pose correctly.

Then she’d blink, and smile, and walk away like nothing happened.

I stopped asking questions.

It happened again.  
I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV. When I woke, the screen was dark, and the house was silent. The clock on the wall said 2:13 a.m.

For a moment I just lay there, trying to remember what woke me. Then I heard it—a faint rustle, like paper shifting against fabric. It came from the corner of the room near the recliner.

I turned my head toward it, squinting through the half‑light.

The pile beside the recliner looked… wrong.  
Taller than before. Wider at the base. The outline was uneven, as if something underneath was moving, slow and careful.

I sat up a little, heart pounding.  
“Audrey?” I whispered.

No answer.

The rustling stopped.

For a few seconds the house was so quiet I could hear my own breathing. Then, from inside the pile, something shifted again—something soft brushing against the layers of fabric and boxes and plastic. The whole thing shuddered faintly, then settled.

I stood, not sure why, and took a slow step toward it. The air smelled stale, heavy with dust and the faint sweetness of old paper.

“Audrey?” I said again, louder this time.

The pile trembled.

A corner of a blanket lifted slightly, as though something underneath had exhaled. I took another step forward. My mouth was dry.

That’s when I saw her.

I could see her cheeks pushing against the edges of an old cereal box, her forehead tucked behind the corner of a rolled-up yoga mat. Her whole face framed by Christmas decorations and crepe paper like some deranged jack-in-the-box.

She was *inside* the pile.

For a long moment neither of us moved.

Then, slowly, she smiled.

It wasn’t a normal smile. It was too wide. Too deliberate. Like her skin didn’t quite fit her bones. Her lips trembled with excitement, and a faint, breathy sound came out of her throat—half laugh, half sigh.

I froze.

“What are you doing?” I whispered. My voice sounded strange to my own ears—thin, childish.

She didn’t answer. She only blinked once, her lashes brushing against the grime on her cheeks. Then she lifted one hand from beneath the folds of fabric. Her fingers were gray with dust, shaking slightly. She pressed a finger to her lips—*shh*—and then lowered it again, disappearing deep inside the pile.

The movement made the pile shift, the whole thing rustling and settling as if alive. A book slid down the side and hit the floor with a dull thud.

I took a step backward, then another. My legs were shaking.

The blankets rippled once more, and I caught a final glimpse of her eyes through the gap—still wide, still watching. Then they vanished deep inside the pile.

The pile stilled completely.

I stood there for what felt like an hour, staring at it, waiting for another movement, another sound. But there was nothing. Just the faint hum of the refrigerator and my own pulse thudding in my ears.

Finally, I backed out of the room, one slow step at a time, never taking my eyes off the recliner corner until I reached the hallway.

I didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. I had the lights on, listening for the faintest sound of movement. But the house stayed quiet.

Too quiet.

Around 7:30 I finally got up and made coffee, my hands still trembling as I poured it. I don’t even remember tasting it. I was just going through the motions, trying to feel normal.

Audrey came into the kitchen about twenty minutes later, yawning and stretching like nothing had happened. Her hair was tied back in a loose braid and she was wearing one of my old hoodies like she always did on her days off.

I just stared at her.

She didn’t have a single smudge on her. No dust. No lint. No indication that she’d spent the night buried under four feet of laundry and soup cans.

She smiled at me like she didn’t notice anything was wrong.

“Morning,” she said, reaching for a mug.

I hesitated before answering. “Hey.”

She poured herself some coffee and took a sip. “You look like hell.”

I forced a dry laugh. “Didn’t sleep much.”

“Hmm.” She leaned against the counter and looked out the window, totally unfazed.

“Audrey,” I said carefully, “we need to talk about the piles.”

She didn’t answer at first. Just took another sip of her coffee, then looked at me over the rim of her mug.

“They’re getting out of hand,” I said. “I mean, seriously. It’s starting to feel like—” I paused. I didn’t want to say *a hoarder’s house*. “—like they’re not just messes anymore. They’re creeping me out a little.”

Her brow furrowed slightly, but not like she was offended. More like she was bored. “They’re just piles,” she said.

“They’re not, though.” I tried to keep my voice calm. “You’re building them like… like they’re for something. You’re putting stuff inside them. You’re arranging them. That one near the recliner? It’s huge now. It’s almost as high as the ceiling.”

She shrugged. “I’ll move that one.”

“That’s not really what I mean.”

She tilted her head and looked at me. Her smile was polite. Small. “You worry too much.”

I set my mug down. “I saw you in it, Audrey.”

Her face didn’t change.

I waited for her to laugh it off, or ask what the hell I was talking about, or deny it completely. But she didn’t. She just stared at me for a long moment and then said, “It’s cozy.”

“What?”

She looked away, back toward the window. “You don’t have to understand it. I like the way it feels.”

My stomach turned. “What feels good about stuffing yourself into a pile of junk?”

She didn’t answer.

We stood there in silence for a few seconds, the only sound the ticking of the kitchen clock. Then she smiled again—just the corners of her mouth twitching up—and walked out of the room without saying another word.

I didn’t follow her.

I didn’t ask anything else.

I just stood there holding my coffee, staring out the window like maybe the answer was out there somewhere.

But it wasn’t.

We didn’t talk much after that. Audrey spent most of the afternoon in the bedroom with the door half closed. I could hear her moving around softly, like she was cleaning or folding something, but I didn’t check. I didn’t want to.

I stayed downstairs. Pretended to scroll my phone. Watched a movie I didn’t follow. But the whole time I couldn’t stop glancing toward the pile.

The one by the recliner.

It was the same one I’d seen her in.  
I hadn’t imagined it. I know what I saw.

She was *in* it. Her face, her hair, her hand coming up to her lips like she was trying to quiet me. Like it was some kind of secret we shared.

I kept thinking about what she said at breakfast. *“It’s cozy.”*  
Like it was a blanket fort or a sleeping bag.

But it wasn’t.

It wasn’t cozy. It was junk.

Boxes. Fabric. Old winter coats. Magazines from years ago. A cracked salad spinner. Things we hadn’t used in ages that somehow ended up stacked floor to ceiling like they belonged there.

The sun had started to go down when I finally stood up and walked toward the pile.

The air felt thicker in there. Musty. Like the kind of stillness you find in an attic. The pile loomed beside the recliner like a second piece of furniture. If you didn’t know better, you’d think it was supposed to be there.

I stood in front of it for a long time. Just staring.

The pile was almost seven feet tall now and stretched nearly six feet across. The top layers were softer—sheets, old hoodies, a pair of bath towels—but underneath was something more structured. More rigid. Like someone had packed it on purpose.

It wasn’t just a pile anymore. It was a *structure*.

I crouched down, hands on my knees, and leaned in closer. The air near it smelled strange. Warm and papery. Like the attic crawlspace at my grandma’s old house. It was stale, but not exactly rotten. Like something had been breathing in there for a long time.

I lifted a folded blanket from the top and gently peeled it back.

Dust rolled into the air like smoke.

Under the blanket were photographs — dozens of them — scattered in no real order. Most of them were of us. Our honeymoon, our old apartment, the day we brought home our cat. But they’d been… altered. Cut, scratched, torn. Some had long lines gouged across our faces. Others were smeared with something that looked like dried mud.

I felt my stomach twist.

Near the center of the pile was a frame. One of our wedding photos. It was the same one that used to hang in the hallway, the one with me in my gray suit and Audrey in her white lace dress. I could see her smile through the cracked glass — but there were stab holes all through it. Dozens of them. Each one small and precise, clustered around her own image.

A knife was still sticking out of the frame.

I froze.

The handle was old wood, worn smooth from years of use. There was something written on it in black ink — four small letters, crooked and childish:

**COZY.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. My brain felt like it had shut off, like it was trying to spare me from understanding what I was looking at.

The smell was stronger now. Sweet and bitter. Something that didn’t belong in a house.

My hand shook as I reached for the knife, but I couldn’t bring myself to touch it. I just crouched there staring at the word, at the little flakes of dried something clinging to the blade.

Behind me, the floor creaked.

I turned, heart in my throat.

Nothing.

I stood up fast, nearly knocking over a stack of books. My breath came in short bursts.

I backed toward the doorway, keeping my eyes on the pile by the recliner.

I’m 2 months post-Pylera treatment for H. pylori. My stomach is mostly okay now, but mentally I feel like I’ve completely fallen apart,

I have constant anxiety, depression, and a globus sensation (tight throat like I can’t swallow). Some days I wake up feeling hopeless and even have scary thoughts that I’ll never get better. Probiotics seem to make my anxiety worse, so I stopped them.

What’s confusing is that I’m taking good care of myself I eat clean and gentle foods: vegetable broth, chicken, rice, bananas, yogurt, olive oil, and honey. No coffee, no alcohol, no junk food. I sleep early, try to walk, and do everything I can to heal naturally… but my mind still feels off.

Has anyone gone through this after H. pylori or antibiotics? How long did it take for your anxiety and mood to return to normal? What helped you the most?

They started chatting — first about school, then about everything. She sent him pictures of her coffee, selfies with messy hair, songs that “reminded her of him.”

She told him he was \*different.\*

He believed her.



Soon, he couldn’t go a day without seeing her name pop up on his screen. They called each other at night, whispering about dreams, fears, and futures. Raj had never felt so close to anyone.



She said things like:



\> “You’re the only one who really gets me.”

\> “Promise you won’t ever leave.”



And he promised — like it meant forever.



But one day, everything changed.



Her “good mornings” stopped. Her messages grew shorter — colder. He saw her laughing in class with another boy, her phone in his hand. The same smile she once had for Raj.



That night, he asked her,



\> “Did I do something wrong?”



She replied hours later:



\> “No, Raj… you just took things too seriously. It was just fun.”



Those words didn’t just break him — they hollowed him out.



He scrolled through their old chats, each \*“I miss you”\* now a wound. He typed,



\> “I really meant it, Isha.”

\> but never sent it.



Days turned to weeks. He stopped talking in class. He deleted Instagram, then reinstalled it again just to look at her profile. Her new photos — smiling with someone else — felt like small knives he couldn’t stop touching.



Every time he saw her at school, she’d smile politely, like nothing ever happened.

And he’d force a smile back, even though his chest ached just to breathe.



One evening, while everyone else was laughing on the school ground, Raj sat alone, watching the sunset.

He whispered to himself,



\> “She’ll never know what she meant to me.”



The wind carried the words away —

and somewhere, his phone buzzed again.

But this time, it wasn’t her.",1,1761559705.0,u_Long_Reference_5374,0,1.0,False

Every month I’d go for shopping ya almost 15k, stock up my fridge and freezer with everything I want and still end up not cooking for a whole month.

Some food stuffs like groceries zinaharibika and at times napeana zote and the same cycle would continue.

It’s now 2 months sijadine outside and I’ve realized I was spending so much money on food, almost 2k daily I’d eat breakfast, lunch, dinner plus nikiwa job I’d constantly order coffee.

Life's been a bit of a mess if I'm honest. It's thrown plenty my way, but I'm still here. Slightly battered and mildly traumatised but still here. I deal with most things through dark humour and self-deprecation. It's a coping mechanism, but at least it's entertaining (for me) for others it makes them quietly uncomfortable. 

I'm 26 from the UK , An introvert with a few days throughout the year where I'm an extrovert. Books, games, movies, TV shows - that’s my comfort zone. I do enjoy being out in nature though, especially if there's coffee involved and the world is still quiet. 

Looking to meet people who are up for honest chats, whether it's deep talks regarding contemplation of us and the universe or completely pointless stuff like what it would be like to live as a sausage. 

If you're kind, at least alittle emotionally aware, and have a twisted sense of humour, we'll probably get on.
If you're into alt & nerdy things, silly conversations, and don't mind a bit of dark humour mixed with actual sincerity, send a message or comment for a dm :) ",1,1761559498.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Life's been a bit of a mess if I'm honest. It's thrown plenty my way, but I'm still here. Slightly battered and mildly traumatised but still here. I deal with most things through dark humour and self-deprecation. It's a coping mechanism, but at least it's entertaining (for me) for others it makes them quietly uncomfortable. 

I'm 26 from the UK , An introvert with a few days throughout the year where I'm an extrovert. Books, games, movies, TV shows - that’s my comfort zone. I do enjoy being out in nature though, especially if there's coffee involved and the world is still quiet. 

Looking to meet people who are up for honest chats, whether it's deep talks regarding contemplation of us and the universe or completely pointless stuff like what it would be like to live as a sausage. 

If you're kind, at least alittle emotionally aware, and have a twisted sense of humour, we'll probably get on.
If you're into alt & nerdy things, silly conversations, and don't mind a bit of dark humour mixed with actual sincerity, send a message or comment for a dm :) ",2,1761559456.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I know a lot of Brits don't fuss too much about tea - especially when speaking to older relatives who were surprised that you're even meant to limit tea. And I know that it's not that it's necessarily correct to assume that just because previous generations did something that its safe - but I do sometimes find a common sense approach is helpful.

2 eggs, 2 homemade sausage patties (like Mcd's ones) 1/2 avocado.

Greek yoghurt, ground cinnamon, chia seeds, nuts, tiniest drizzle of honey.

Mon: Spin, Pilates, then pole in the evening

Tues: Bodypump, functional circuits

Wed: Spin, Pilates

Thurs: Bodypump, functional circuits

Fri: Spin, Pilates

Sat: Spin, sometimes might do functional circuits

Sun: Might swim sometimes in the morning.

DH had a long (and he claims productive) discussion w/MIL. I'm STILL not talking to her, or being around her when she comes over and it's really getting under her skin. I've spent exactly one hour looking at clothes she bought for the kids one day, and that's it. Outside of that I've completely ignored her and avoided being anywhere near her, which she views as being ""cowardly"".  Also, she bought me a cute Disney shirt. She does nice things like that when I go silent.

I was out of the house when she came over today, and of course she made a negative remark about me ""going off to do things while DH is stuck at home with the kids"" and not being around when she comes by anymore.  Not that it's her business, but I was at a memorial service supporting a friend of mine who lost her partner, and have been helping her take care of his final affairs since he passed a few months ago. She has no other support.

DH did explain that our parenting of our kids is at times more challenging bc we have 3 kids, and she only had one.  My leaving the house and doing other things, be it helping a friend or going shopping for down time and recharging doesn't make me a bad mother. We spent the morning as a family at a Farmer's Market btw.

He reiterated that her ""jokes"" about hitting me with the maid's cart are not actually jokes, bc he knows she was annoyed with me when she said it, so there was an element of truth to what she said and how she felt. He said she admitted he was right.

She'll tell me to let her know when something annoys her, then acts pissy and irritated when I do and she will DARVO. She was annoyed bc I asked him to tell her to back off when she continually complained about what we packed for our last trip. She knows we use everything we pack, be it a coffee maker (We've heard too many horror stories about hotel ones), food, a potty seat, bed rails, a small pharmacy (someone ALWAYS seems to need meds), dishes, etc. It has ZERO bearing on her, but damned if she won't share her opinion on it that we ""packed too much stuff"" compared to her one bag.

I prefer to reuse dishes instead of packing a bunch of stuff that will end up in a landfill, and it's something I've done since childhood in order to save money on travel expenses.  My MIL was an only child. My mother had 4 kids.  That's how we traveled and saved money, and avoided eating out all of the time. We took our own stuff. My dad hauled a trailer behind our van.

She asked if she even needed to bother to go on this upcoming trip with us, or if she even needs to be around anymore (I know this is her victim mentality asking this question). He explained to her that this isn't really the kind of relationship he wants. He wants her to ""be Grandma"", and that's it.

He told her that I care what they think about me, and they've really hurt me with the negative things she and my FIL have said over the years. Telling us we packed too much stuff for example isn't helpful and doesn't affect her, so she doesn't need to worry about it.

She made the comment to him that ""Well we're just going to have to put our big girl panties on then, and grow up"".  He thinks that's a generational mindset difference. He shut it down and said, ""No. You need to be more mindful of what you say to my wife, or just don't say anything. We don't want that kind of negativity. If you're going to be negative, keep it to yourself. We are not asking for your opinions. Just be there and enjoy the vacation."" (I've already addressed questions about why we're still traveling w/her to Disney in previous posts.).

He told her that saying to ""put on our big girl panties"" is like telling a child to ""calm down"". No one calms down when you tell them to, and it's dismissive of how they feel. It's not helpful. It's judgemental, and I'm tired of them judging me, so I'm choosing not to be around it. He thinks she is starting to understand. 🤷‍♀️

My stance? Big girls aren't mean to each other, and don't make mean girl ""jokes"" to each other. I AM being a ""big girl"". I've dropped the rope and walked away. I'm not required to subject myself to continued verbal abuse, hatred, and judgement from her, and I'm tired of trying.  She's had 12 years to figure out how to like me.

He asked what our plans are for Christmas. I told him I don't have any, just that I'M not going to be around for Christmas break.  I wasn't even planning on decorating, nor seeing his parents.  He's welcome to do whatever with the kids and figure out childcare, but I will not be around.  He asked me if he could join me and we could take the kids out of town. 

I told him, ""Fine, but I'm not hearing about it from MIL. I'm not taking her sh*t this year. I'll tell her off if she starts."" He said he'll address it with his mom, given how she acted last year when we went out of town.  He also asked if we could decorate for Christmas. I said I'd help, but I don't want to hear any complaining when it's time to do so.",4,1761559342.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,0.83,False

X-Design automatically generated a simple logo display, but it was not the effect I wanted. I think it is too simple and not enough to replace the design function of human beings. So I spent a lot of time optimizing my instructions. Finally I got this. Do you think this logo meets the commercial standards?

Certainly not an expert with coffee and I’ve learned loads from this page, I have an issue and thought this would be the best place to start.

So, I have a 2 week old Luxe Pro and after following the manufacturer and folks on her guidance I got my machine dialled in and the coffee was great in my not so expert opinion.

However, in the last week, so machine only one week old it has been extracting or yielding between 60-70g for a double shot and the coffee tastes over extracted and weak. I already completed a factory reset, and after wasting 3x double shots worth of beans it yields the correct amount given the strength selected, but the very next shot, made straight away after again yields between 60-70g. I’ve timed the extraction time and its total about 50 seconds and over 30 from the first drop. The flow rate looks perfect so grind size doesn’t seem to be the problem it’s just the pump is running for far too long.

Can anyone offer any insight, if so that would be greatly appreciated?

Additional info: coffee beans medium/dark and roasted mid September and I’m using filtered water.

Their meeting place is this school he wants to make and most times people do not see them for hours or if they do they’re always together, there’s closeness as friends but then there’s these two. Everyone has witnessed her going into his living area only to reemerge hours later. They have met elsewhere and there is camera footage of everything that only they have access to.

He even lets her park her car in his garage, brings her sweets, cakes and other delicacies in front of all the other staff along with the coffee sharing.

The director is a womaniser and likes to have affairs all over the place. The husband works elsewhere and I don’t think he has any idea of the school project or anything that his wife has going on at work. Part of me feels it’s wrong to tell him anything however there is a part of me that wants to tell home and the wife complains that he treats her like garbage to everyone and has openly flirted with younger guys and other management only to report them for sexual harassment later on.

1ohaa08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohaa08,Wow,"Just getting done with my first trip to Iceland. If I can have any control over it, there will be at least one more. This place is not overrated. Here’s my two cents plus some. 

First, things to be prepared for:

1- It really is expensive. We got a handmade little sheep figure. $52USD 
2- Parking will be $10 each spot. So if you pack a lot into a day, that could be $50 easily. 
3- For gas, you probably have to go inside or use your debit card. 

This country is AMAZINGGGG

• The weather and views change about every 500 meters. 
• One day was very snowy but the weather apps said it was clear. (Get the AWD with winter tyres!)
• We had the luck to see Northern Lights. The nice thing of the time change from the US is that at 11pm we were wide awake so we went to chase Northern Lights. 
• Some attractions are open (and lit) 24/7 and no one was on the roads at night so we used our first night to drive about 4 hours and got to the Diamond Beach at sunrise. 
• Diamond Beach tip, if you are driving use the SE parking lot. We had it to ourselves and could walk under the bridge to the glacier bay (my personal favorite of the trip!)
• Use the pull outs to let others over. We stopped often to just go see a stream, horses and sheep, buildings. It was pretty great. 
• Crowds at Geysir were unreal for us when we went. 
• Most places were good at knowing what was gluten free or not. 

Recommendations:
• Thai place in Selfoss is AMAZING food with huge potions which is unusual for Iceland. 
• Hella cave tour was fascinating for history and sense of the country 
• Next to cave tour is a US School Bus that has coffee. Worth it for the friendly owner, cool vibes & great coffee. 
• Rok in Reykjavik was a cool dining experience. 

Gear:
• We used every bit of gear we had. 
•Sunglasses, waterproof pants to go over hiking pants, wool socks, waterproof boots, thermal layers, scarf, hat, gloves, winter coat, micro spikes (even for the normal attractions, the paths get icy!)

When I first retired, I still had that major drive to be productive and build something. But recently, especially this last year, I've gotten way more easygoing with myself. I’ve learned that I don't even need a mission.

My main focus now is my health, more than ever. In a way, this is its own ""project with progress,"" but the big difference is I can finally just live day-to-day without feeling weird or like I *have* to have a project.

I recently even gave up on an AI-related project I was working on. It just got too repetitive. Now, I basically spend half the day on my health, grab lunch and a coffee with my wife, and then play video games, meet friends, or work on random projects.

With all the new AI stuff, it's easy to fall into that ""shiny toy syndrome."" But now, I just let myself enjoy it. I might vibecode a little or check out new image models. It took some time to be okay with the idea that it doesn't *have* to have a productive outcome.

I just wanted to share this reflection on how things changed. I know a lot of people (myself included) think it's crucial to retire *to* something. I still agree, but I was positively surprised to find I can feel truly free and not be driven by accomplishing successful stuff anymore.",13,1761558692.0,fatFIRE,8,1.0,False

I’ve reached that glorious stage in life where I’ve “tried everything” (or so it feels) — except apparently finding a consistent teammate who doesn’t vanish mid-game or mid-conversation. 😅

I’m 50, based in Belgium, love gaming (PC mostly), chatting, and just having a chill time online without drama or ego contests. I don’t rage (unless my character dies in a really stupid way), and I enjoy people who can laugh at themselves.

I’m not here for dating — just want to find someone fun, kind, maybe a bit sarcastic, who enjoys late-night co-op sessions or random voice chats while pretending to be productive.

If you’re up for a friendship built on caffeine, gaming, and mutual emotional support during loading screens, say hi.

Bonus points if you can recommend a cozy game or survive my sense of humor.

It was my cousin, a person I hadn't seen in ages. As he stole my coffee and made fun of my messy hair, I was stunned by his irreversible glow-up. The man now talking about business growth and sales is the same boy we were told wouldn't live to see his twenties.

His life has been a chain of hardships: losing his mom at eight, a stepmother who denied him proper meals, and a father who became entangled in shady work overseas, lost his job, and was labeled a scammer. At fourteen, he was diagnosed with diabetes. His body bloated, he stopped growing, and he couldn't afford his insulin.

While I sailed through university, he struggled with his bac exam and eventually gave up. I remembered our nights on Grandma's roof, where we'd gaze at the stars and curse everyone who had ever used him as a doormat or made him run errands for dimes.

And yet, he never surrendered. He survived abuse, failure, malnutrition, and missing insulin shots to not only see his twenties but to build a life. Now, seeing my own life fall apart, he didn't offer the comfort I once gave him. He offered me a business partnership, as his growing clientele is becoming more than he can handle.

I’ve been reading posts here since my IDC diagnosis 9/22. It’s been hard. I have a three-year-old and a nine-month-old and I’m sad and scared. HER2+, ER+ 100%, PR+50%

Right now I’m most scared about chemo, and about the fact that everyone is always so somber and almost grim when they talk to me. I have a 2x9cm mass in my right breast and MRI showed no spread to the lymph nodes, but they’ve still done no staging and I’m set to start chemo (TCHP) 11/4. 

I worry all the time. I just went through two hyperemesis gravidarum pregnancies and am now 20lb below where I started with my first, after making an effort to gain weight after my surgeon told me to get my weight up before chemo. It’s hard for me to eat much after HG but I was doing ok until my diagnosis and since I hate looking at food and survive on coffee and spite. 

I’m going to post something here now so you don’t need to tell me in the future: I’m in an emotionally abusive marriage and was looking at getting out when I got my diagnosis, but his money pays for my excellent health care, so I’m staying and protecting my kids from his nonsense while I work further on a way out. Better an alive mom than anything, right?

I’m currently scared of one thing: will chemo hurt going in? It’s TCHP. Of all the myriad concerns I have, that’s the one I’m focused on. I had them do my first prechemo draws through my port so I would know what it felt like and as always I didn’t even feel the lidocaine going in (the anesthesiologist and I had a very funny chat before my port placement —first time I didn’t wake up during GA, though, so a win!)

If anyone has advice on how to stay sane sitting still during infusions, that would be a help. And again, do the meds hurt going in? And does anyone who’s done this with small children have advice?

1oha2zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oha2zg/saltwater_part_2/,Saltwater (Part 2),"I breathed as deeply as I could to try and calm myself. Glancing feverishly around for anything to barricade the door with, I realized we were in another bunk room, this one with larger beds, a higher ceiling, and more room. Officer’s quarters more than likely. The corner of the room held a wooden alcove blocked from view by a soft maroon curtain. These beds too held the remains of their occupants, with their clothes and artificial lungs folded neatly by their skulls. Footlockers sat at the end of each bed and I approached, desperate for a gun, or knife, or wooden stake.

Rifling through the belongings of the trunk labeled R. Schmidt bore no fruit, and I moved onto the next bed down the line. J. Hohe’s Locker held only old clothing and indecipherable letters. I cursed and began to stand too quickly, banging my head on the bed above. Its chains clanked and bones clattered onto the floor around me. I rubbed the sore spot, then ran on the balls of my feet to where Pieter still lay. Whispering a prayer under my breath I pulled his auxiliary tank off and set it on the ground nearby still attached, then rolled his body onto his back, and placed my ear to his chest listening intently. The soft rhythmic thumping of his chest was nearly drowned out by the ravings of the monster, but they were there all the same. My heart lifted a little. If I could manage to get him awake, Pieter could help me into my atmospheric suit and I could return to the surface to get him help. My hope disappeared as I checked him for any other injuries. The twisted ankle had become a break, his bone jutting out through his skin and far too much blood trickling out of it. There was no way for him to make it up the ladder we entered from. Not with only me to help. 

My medical training started and ended with rescue diver experience, and I tried to attend to his wounds the best I could. A record sprint to the medical bay and back left me with an ancient bottle of peroxide and a tourniquet. I twisted the device over his thigh until I couldn’t anymore and unstopped the bottle. I doubted the efficacy of eighty year old wound cleaner, but upon pouring the solution over his leg, Pieter was brought back to consciousness, quite literally kicking and screaming. Even if it hadn’t helped sanitize, at least I wasn’t alone in here anymore.

*“JEZUS GODVERDOMME CHRISTUS!”*

“Sorry Pieter, fuck’s sake, I was worried I’d lost you.”

“My head! God above”

“Gimme a sec, I’m gonna find you some bandages” Standing, I began my way back to the already open footlockers. I grabbed what looked to be a cotton jumper and began tearing it into strips. Bone crunched under my foot and I looked below. Tiny, brittle, fragments splintered beneath my sock, but something was odd. Around my foot were a handful of human ribs, all of them cracked in the middle. It was too perfect to have happened when they had all fallen. Confused, I peered up into the bunk which they had fallen from, and grabbed another bone at random. The partial femur my hand had selected came away neatly from its other half. There was no marrow in the broken segment. Every single other bone was exactly the same, cracked neatly down the middle, absent of marrow, and meticulously seated into its other half. All of the skeletons were anatomically correct, with not so much as a fingerbone missing. Pieter groaned again.

“Ah Christ, sorry” I jogged back over to Pieter and began wrapping his ankle. “Alright soldier, I need a way out of here” I pulled the bandage tight to his protest, and moved to the head wound I wouldn’t have noticed if not for his previous exclamation.

“Medical bay…saw a map of the place” It was good enough. I hoisted him onto my shoulder and slowly shuffled us back towards the nearest free bed. The monster had gone quiet now, which made me uneasy. Pieter didn't seem to mind the silence. I don’t think he would’ve cared about anything at that point. I tried to lay him gingerly onto the bed but my foot slipped and he tumbled onto it a little rougher than I would have liked. He moaned.

“On the…wall, by the records” The ship's schematic was tacked slightly askew onto the siding of the medical bay. Studying it, I saw that down the yet unexplored hallway in the bay was the front torpedo room. I checked my memory and figured that was around where the damage to the hull would be. 

“I’ll be right back Pieter” He grunted in acknowledgement. I slipped my way through the unexplored hallway until I reached the room depicted. Four large circles lay at the front of the room, and great black scorch marks stretched across the inner right wall of the prow. At the site of impact was a grey metal sheet welded carefully to its place. On the ground beneath the artful repair job was a long, rotting bough of timber. The realization struck me only then. Either one of those corpses was a traitor, or these men had sunk themselves. My head reeled. I understood so very little. Pulling open the hatches to the torpedoes, I raised my flashlight and peered inside. All but one of them were still filled, though I doubted any of them would fire if launched. Maybe the red lever attached to the empty tube would open the outer hatch, but I made no attempt to pull it. I made my way back to my friend to check his condition. His teeth were starting to chatter, and his cheeks were losing their color. Piling the old, thin, bleached blankets around him, I checked his pulse again, then made my way over to the wall. 

Now, I tore the blueprint from the wall and placed it on the table amidst the still open medical folders. Getting Pieter to translate for me, I figured the ship was now divided into “Our side” and “Its side” by the door between the officers’ quarters and the radio room. There would be no escape for either of us if I didn’t explore further into the ship. Pieter’s occasional insights illuminated the only way out for either of us. Through the currently sealed bulkhead was the radio room, followed by another storage room, and an electrical engine room. Pieter inhaled sharply and in a strained voice, said

“There will be diving suits in the rear storage room. They are old, and likely in poor condition, but you only need to make it back to the diving bell.”

We both knew going out as I was now, the pressure would crush me. Worse comes to worst, I would still prefer that to the alternatives waiting for me here, but I would take any chance I had to get off of this ship in one piece. I remembered something and found myself growing curious. There was still something left to check before leaving Pieter alone in the dark.

Ripping open the filing cabinet, I began removing and opening every folder I could. Petty officers, engineers, radio operators, even the captain. All marked with the same red curse. Then, nearly through the last drawer, I found it. That thing still had the same face. Thinner, but no older than the picture in front of me. Red ink on this page too, but not used for words. Like a child draws on a wall, the information had been scribbled and struck through in a manic, absurd way. A few words were left unblemished, of them I could only understand one.

“**WUNDERWAFFE”**

After what I’d been through, it didn't even make me blink. I did one last check on Pieter, and exited from the medical bay. Averting my eyes from the trash pile as I passed through the storage room, I tried not to consider its implications, but failed. Now, the squeeze through the industrial ever-coitus of pipes as I made my way towards the curtain in the officers’ quarters. If I was going to get anywhere near that thing, it would not be unarmed. The sound began again.

Distant, echoey thuds though softer than before, like flesh on metal. The thing had dropped its hammer when it noticed me, and when I again reached the officer’s quarters, I took the time to retrieve it, placing it in my belt. Pulling back the maroon curtain, I nearly cried in relief at the otherwise pitiful sight that awaited me. Similar to his crew, Captain Wohler’s bones were naked and snapped cleanly. His clothes were folded neatly at the top of his bed, but there was no rebreather. The captain’s cause of death was far more obvious. In his right hand was a small pistol that the reports would list as a Walther PPK. In the right temple of the captain's skull was a round hole that was mirrored on the left side where the bullet exited. The lead had lodged itself in the wooden wall, but was completely clean otherwise. I realized as I pulled the little pistol from the Captain’s hands that it too was untarnished. No rust, or viscera, and not so much as a streak of gunpowder on the ivory grips. I pulled back the slide, and sure enough, a round sat squarely in the chamber. The gun’s magazine was missing only a single round, but any extra ammunition could make the difference. 

I began to rummage through the writing desk to the captain’s left. An empty bottle of Peach liquor, stationary, an old dead flashlight. I sighed when my hand brushed the empty leather holster, and I found a single extra magazine beneath it. I set the pistol into its place and snapped the holster onto my tool belt, removing some of the less useful items from it and setting it on the desk to try and balance the weight. Sat on top of the desk were two things. A worn gun cleaning kit, and a document flecked with dried blood. I realized then. 

There was only one way an eighty year old war relic could have been kept in such great condition. My stomach turned at the thought of that thing rearranging the finger bones of his superior exactly as they were when he found him. Here was where the pinky bones went, the thumb wrapped like that. Reconstituting the suicide of his captain God knows how many times. All to keep things in proper order. To what end? Pushing aside the thoughts I picked up the document, knowing very well I wouldn’t be able to read a word of it. It was handwritten in an unsure, staccato script. Bold lettering stared from the top and an icon of a German eagle perched in the upper-left corner A thin yellow sheet fell from under my fingers, joined at its top to the document by glue. I hadn’t known the Nazis used carbon copying but the sheet was perfectly familiar to me all the same. I gently tore off the bottom sheet, folded it twice across its center, and tucked it beneath my water proof undersuit, not wanting the sheet to be ruined if I did somehow make it out. There was little else keeping me now. It was time. 

With no great show, I passed out of the curtain to the grisly scene, spun open the door to the unknown, and marched forward.

The dark is far scarier when you know something lurks within. My spine tingled and my hands shook as I resealed the hatch behind me, The clanging was intermittent now, and inconsistent in its tone. The noise felt far enough for me to continue forward with my light on, but not comfortably so. I took very little notice of the radio room as I crept through it, paying far more attention to my feet. One stubbed toe or upset waste bin could very well kill me and leave Pieter to choke, or freeze, or die of whatever else. One foot in front of the other kept me occupied, and moving forward. When I  reached the door to the storage room it was pulled mostly closed and I peeked in. No faces stared back at me, and the door to the Electrical engine was shut completely. I hurried in and took stock. 

Three aged diving suits hung on hooks on the left wall. I closed in and touched my fingertips to the bronze helmet of the one closest. Quickly now, I slipped out of my belt and into the reinforced oilskin jumpsuit. These too had been perfectly maintained. I suppose the ship’s sole crewman had a lot of time to read manuals and practice upkeep. My fingers fumbled as I fastened and buttoned myself, listening intently to the next room over for any changes in behavior. Now for the helmet. The tanks the suits originally had were hefty, and likely contained no oxygen anyway, and would be left here, as my auxiliary tank would be enough and could fit in the mass of the helmet and under the oilskin suit. More buttons, screws, pausing every time the noise stopped. At this point everything was at least on my body except the boots, which would clang loudly against the flooring if I walked with them on. I grabbed them up, retied my belt, and began back towards Pieter when a new sound began to ring through my helmet. 

Familiar electronic beeping filled my ears; the thirty minute alarm on my rebreather was telling me I didn’t have much longer. I switched off my flashlight and began to undo the bolts securing the helmet to the suit. Stumbling backwards through the darkness, I backed to the wall where the suit had hung and pressed myself against it, still feverishly tearing at the fasteners. The thing had stopped making noise, and to my horror, I heard the sound of a hatch wheel spinning. We had never been safe at all, of course that thing knew how to use the doors. A guttural scream as I slipped my hand through and stopped the alarm, the sound of the hatch being flung open and then, stillness. A thud…another, it was approaching my wall. More footsteps until I felt it. Fingers brushing against the outer layer of my suit. Heavy breathing from the pale man as I held my hand over my mouth to stifle the sound of my own panicked gasps. The fingers turned sharper, pressing into the suit. I had no doubt the monster could shred through it with its nails if it wished. I did not scream, nor did I sob, nor did I run. It was over and I was dead, except. 

*\*CLANG\**

A loud crash, joined by an accented voice

“Come and get some, you freak!” Pieter's strained voice was distant but recognizable. He began to sing in a bassy voice. *“Wat zullen we drinken – Zeven dagen lang…”* It was an old drinking song he’d taught me when we first met. Pieter had heard us, and was pulling its attention away. The pressure on my chest disappeared and was replaced by the loud slaps of the monster’s bare feet sprinting towards the cacophony. Rhythmic metal clanging as Pieter began banging two cans together and continued. *“Wat zullen we drinken? Wat een dorst!”*

I could not let him kill himself, not with the family he would leave behind. I ripped the gun from its holster and took my flashlight with the other hand, attaching it to my chest. The boots slid on easily and I clanged after the two of them, speeding up when I heard the bulkhead slam open. As I closed in, Pieter’s singing raised in pitch abruptly, and then cut off, as a loud thump shook the ship. My heart sank. When I entered the trash storage room, and found the two of them, the pale figure was huddled with its back to me, crouched on the ground, moving its head wildly. Pieter lay gasping, flat on the floor in front of it. 

“Get the fuck away from him!” I shouted with all the courage I could muster, gun pointed squarely at its head. It stopped moving, and dropped what it was holding. Pieter’s leg rolled from behind its frame, detached at the knee. Chunks of flesh were ripped from the calf,  and the ankle was now almost disconnected. I tracked it with the sights as it brought itself up on its legs as it turned to face me, teeth bared and coated in red. The gun fired once, almost startling me, the report echoing through my entire body. The round caught the monster in its cheek and made the thing scream. I lowered the pistol slightly, not trusting my aim as it charged for me. My fingers moved on their own, squeezing the trigger until the gun clicked. I might have closed my eyes, I don't really remember. It had been hit in the chest and fallen to its knees, some organ deep inside its skinny body was perforated, making a hissing sound. Our eyes met, his now a deeper blue than before, far less wild and frantically tracing over my own. The bullet holes dripped a clear, thick mucus, and he fell now completely, his cracked lips moving wordlessly. Weakly, he lifted his arm from the floor, reaching out towards me, his hand open rather than clawing. A death rattle escaped his bloodied mouth, and the monster’s head fell to the floor, his heart stopped. 

I flung myself down to Pieter’s side, and thanked God for the monster picking the already tourniquet wrapped leg to gnaw at. A pool of blood crept from Pieter’s stump, but far less than there would have been. The shock had knocked Pieter out, but I promised to return with help all the same. It was not yet a lie when I said it.  
Water was sloshing from behind me now. I cursed myself for not just leaving and turned to face my death but, the creature lay still where it was. I drew closer, pulling out the thick hammer. The pale man was melting. His skin liquefied, then collapsed into the new cavity. A bubbling, murky white liquid filled his innards until its skeleton and the basin of its ribs collapsed as well. The frothy seafoam that was my attacker only moments ago drained into the tightly slitted floor below us. The only thing I could do for Pieter now was getting help from Command. I prayed aloud as I crashed towards the torpedo room..

When I reached the surface without Pieter, the storm had not passed. The journey back up had been far more violent, though I hardly noticed the shakes and shudders of the bell. My radio, foolishly left behind, likely wouldn’t have worked anyway, and the dive phone remained unanswered no matter how many times I tried to key into Command. My borrowed helmet was already off when the door to the bell was finally opened. Command, or as I knew him, Paul, leaned over the open hatch, hair plastered against his head from the rain and sea-spray. Only then did I start crying.

“Pieter’s still down there, get me another suit! We’ve got to go get him back!” Paul shouted something back to me, but his words were stolen by the wind and booming thunder. I grabbed onto the ladder, and started making my way out. Paul’s rough hands grabbed at the scruff of the suit, and he hoisted me out, both of us tumbling onto the deck of the ship. Men rushed about around us, hollering orders to each other, desperate to break through the din. The words tumbled again from my mouth.

“He’s hurt bad Paul! His leg was ripped off! He doesn’t have much time, please, you have to send me back dow-” Paul cut me off, shouting over the roar as the sea swelled around us.

“You’re not going back down there son. Not like this” Rising to my feet now.

“HE’LL DIE DOWN THERE IN THAT FUCKING SHIP IF YOU DON-”

I stopped myself. Bright lights surrounded our ship, and I realized I was in the middle of a small flotilla. A large navy cruiser bobbed in the water next to us, with three smaller PT boats escorting it. A second ship from the company's own fleet sat on the opposite side of our boat. On it, two other men were in the middle of putting on their diving suits. Paul shouted to me again.

“The others will handle it from here, right now the best thing you can do is give us information”

I paused for a moment, steadying my breathing, then raised my voice

“Make sure they have auxiliary tanks, there’s no water in the submarine.” Paul stared at me for a beat, then tapped his ear as though he had misheard me.

I told them the same story time and time again, down to the look in that thing's eyes as it died. They never laughed once, nor was I shouted at or accused. Those men moved me from dull room to dull room, and I talked at their suits and ties for God knows how long. There were no handcuffs, or chains, or orange jumpsuits, but I knew very well that I would not be able to leave their custody until they found it appropriate. They put us in these cramped rooms with a bed, and a lamp, and a little attached bathroom so as to keep us from interacting with each other. The worst part was not knowing if Pieter was dead or just asleep one door down the hall. They wouldn’t tell me anything about what I saw either. I expected dropped jaws, or gasps, or maybe smirks when I spoke about the thing down there, but got blank stares instead.

You have to understand. That’s why I did it. I hadn’t even remembered the carbon copy until I stripped down to bathe that first night. It fluttered out of the undersuit I had on and onto the floor. I started to call out to let them know about it when I realized they would already have all the info on it. I took a closer look instead. The suit had kept it protected from the sea spray but not from my sweat. Thankfully, I could still make out the uneasy script, moist as it was, as well as the faint gray cross from where I had folded the paper. I laid it out to dry under one of the bleached white towels they provided us, and it sat either there, or folded against my body until they finally let us go weeks later.

The worker’s comp form read “Short term psychosis caused by Carbon Monoxide poisoning” and the medical leave was indefinite, which I took full advantage of. Phony as the cause may have been, the sizable check gave me a war chest of sorts. I had enough money now for a few private investigators, a German translator, and plenty of sleeping pills. The PI couldn’t find so much as a trace of Pieter or his family. No phone bills, or social media, or obituaries. He couldn’t even prove that the address Pieter had given me for Christmas cards ever belonged to him. Of the two divers who had gone down after me, one was killed in a car accident shortly after, and the other refused to answer any of my messages. Paul, however, had heard from him.

Paul had quit, of course, and was living in Florida when we found him. He agreed to meet and I caught the next available flight. Neither of us were much interested in pleasantries or catching up, we knew each other far too well for that sort of thing. The coffee his wife poured us sat untouched for the duration of our conversation, slowly growing colder in their chipped white mugs. I went first, recounting my story for the last time, until now. Paul’s reactions were far more in tune with what I expected, and I didn’t notice myself trembling until he grabbed my shoulder, and asked me for a break with tears in his eyes.

Pieter was our friend, and Paul had known him longer than I did. Pieter had gone to his wedding, and they’d held each other's kids. Pieter was dead, and neither of us were buying it. The official story made no mention of any injuries found, or autopsies performed. According to the rescue dive report Pieter was found “Cold and unresponsive with no pulse, body was recovered, remains cremated and sent to surviving family” Paul of course couldn’t find Pieter’s family either, though I suspected he hadn’t tried as hard as me. He seemed to be ready to leave it all behind, and I found out why as he went on. 

By the time the rescue crew surfaced, Paul was already at port, being interrogated in a room near mine. Eric, the one who had disappeared, had called Paul about a month after we had been released. Paul said he sounded frantic, and Eric told him that the report was wrong. When they had gotten down there, Pieter was still breathing, but seemed to have dragged himself to the medical bay and fallen unconscious on one of the beds. His leg was still in the storage room, eaten like I had said. Paul said the phone line was disconnected mid sentence shortly after, and he wasn’t able to get much more of use out of him.

At this point, I find it prescient to reveal to you what I was keeping from Paul, as I did to him when I was told this. My carry-on for the flight to Orlando was light. An overnight bag with some cash, my wallet, a change of clothes, and a manilla folder carrying the translated copy of what I found on the Captain's desk. The college student I had hired to do it was smart, but we only corresponded online. I was able to convince her I was a German author trying to break through into the English market. If only. The document was not, as I had originally thought, a log from the captain’s journal. It was a radio message, decoded by hand, and read as follows:

*For immediate action.*

*This is a message for Captain Wohler of U-897. This relay will entail your final orders, and last communication from German High Command. The war is lost, and the Reich will soon fall. You must honor your countrymen by completing this final task to its fullest. The encroaching Allies must not be allowed to gain control over this wonder-weapon of ours, and its destruction is impossible. The war correspondent newly assigned to your crew is to be preserved within your ship until such a time that a successor to our great Reich can retrieve him. All records of your submarine, its crew, and its current location have been destroyed, and only a select few ‘designated survivors’ of the Reich have been trusted with its knowledge.*

*Upon reaching the previously discussed coordinates, you are to detonate a scuttle charge, and sink your ship, so as to give an outside appearance of destruction during battle. The breach is then to be repaired, and any sea water is to be pumped out. Should the correspondent ever become frantic at any point during this operation and begin to undergo the transformation early, make no attempt to harm him. Any damage inflicted upon him will be repaired in whole after liquefaction and reformation, and his memory will remain intact. The hatch on your conning tower has already been sealed, so as to prevent any unwanted egress by the correspondent. He, and the rest of your crew are at no time to be made aware of any other possible exits*

*Upon completion of the above duties, you are relieved of your command, and no more is expected of you. Your’s, and your crew’s sacrifice will be honored for generations to come in the hearts of every German.*

*Hail Victory,*

*Generalfeldmarschall Kreutz*

*March 30th, 1945* 

Paul, finished reading now, leaned back into his chair, closed the folder, and put his hands over his eyes. I took the opportunity to ask him.

“What else did Eric say before the call was cut off. Did he see him?”

“He said nothing else save for how you were mistaken and the leg was broken in two places other than one, but knowing them, there’s no way they would have left Pieter down there if they had any choice.” I breathed through my nose and stared down at the floor, thinking. Something wasn’t sitting right.

“How did they know the leg was broken in two places if they were in such a rush to find Pieter?”

“He said it was pretty obvious. When they went to pick up his bones, they had been snapped in half. I figured that’s what you came upon when you found that thing over Pieter.”

My heart thudded against my chest. That wasn’t how I had left his leg, but I suppose I should have already expected as much. Thanking Paul for his time, I stood,  shook his hand, and left his house. There was a return flight to catch. I don't think Pieter is still down there, and I pray every night that thing still is. A part of me can't help but wonder, though. If it learned how to maintain that ship in perfect darkness, then maybe I taught it how to leave.

1oha0to,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belgrade/comments/1oha0to/update_our_visit_to_belgrade/,UPDATE: Our visit to Belgrade :),"This is an update of my previous post, in which I asked for recommendations and tips for our visit to Belgrade. We went this last weekend (October 24, 25, and 26).

**We loved it and it was a really nice surprise.**  
We stayed in the Skadarlija neighborhood, really nice, secure, and has a great atmosphere.  
Besides churches, parks, viewpoints, nice streets, some of the places that we really enjoyed:  
\- **Konoba Akustik - Stari Beograd**: Our first Kafana, it was really nice seeing all the people dancing and singing.  
\- **Pričica Coffee Bar**: Small, crowded bar.  
\- **Klub 20/44**: Fantastic club with great atmosphere and 3 dance floors with different DJs  
\- **Tri šešira**: Really great restaurant, this was the most expensive in our visit, but still a good price.  
\- **Danubius** (in Gardoš): This street full of restaurants and bars over de Danube was incredible, we loved this place.

**-> What did we like most?** People: 90% of all the people that we met were super nice and friendly. And when we said we were Argentinians, they were like "":D what? Why are you in Belgrade?"" (surprised with a smile on their faces). I imagined it a bit because in my previous post here, everyone was helpful.  
Also, the meat and dishes with meat were really tasty.

  
**-> What didn't we like?** That everyone smokes cigarettes inside A LOT. We understand it's normal, but we come from countries that were prohibited many years ago, so if you want to smoke to go outside, no matter if it's rainy or cold. So that was very annoying for us.

We did have a great time! Belgrade is a nice and secure city, people there are welcoming and make you feel good.

THANKS!

I went from Toronto to Portugal with a connecting flight in Ireland and on the way back, a connecting flight in Newark, USA. On my way back  when I landed in Newark Airport, I had a 6 hour layover into a 6am flight back to Toronto. When I went to go check through the border, I was stopped by an officer checking my passport, For reference, I am born and raised in Canada with a Canadian passport. My passport had a coffee stain from during the trip and he started asking me questions when he saw it. He asked me suddenly if I had ever been arrested. I was extremely tired from the flight and hesitated when I said no. He told me that I took awhile to answer that and immediately said to follow him. I was taken into separate waiting area where I was told to hand over my passport to a group of border officers. They scanned and looked up my passport and then told me that there wasn't anything on my immediate criminal record but they could see 'something' in the system. I was then prompted to give my story of my trip and how I was just waiting for connecting flight back to my home country. I ended up telling the officer that I had been arrested before in Canada and that I had received a conditional discharge. My lawyer said when I had received the conditional discharge that no one he ever knew had ever been stopped when entering the U.S.A. but here I was getting stopped for trying to enter. After telling the officer that, they had me answer a series of questions about my personal information where they recorded on computer. They went through all of my luggage and then held me in the waiting area for 6 hours until they police escorted me to my flight back into Canada. They had also handed me a copy of the questions I was asked and answered along with document's saying this was recorded by the U.S. government. Me, being an absolute idiot, had lost that document folder in a recent move to a new house. 

This was all a very big shock to me especially since I had travelled to and back the U.S. the previous year that also had a connecting flight in Newark in which case I had no issue at the border. I brought that up to the officers at the time and they had basically told me that the border control at the time simply 'didn't do their job' when I previously entered. I was also told that I needed a waiver of some sort for if I ever wanted to enter the U.S. again. I haven't been back since but need to go in April for a big event. I had recently gotten my criminal record checked thoroughly and there is nothing on it. Any advice on if I need a waiver, and the best way to obtain it would be much appreciated.

So this weekend my parents came up to spend the night and to celebrate my husband's birthday with him. I unfortunately ended up staying home with a sick migraine. Anyways we have a four year old Rottweiler that's adorable of course but for some reason when my parents take him downstairs and then out to go potty he takes a detour and pees on our cats litter boxes. He only does that for my parents. So at five a m my mom and I are both up eating breakfast and Kronk has to go outside. I said kindly, mom don't take him out I will take him out he owes in the litter boxes downstairs. 

She immediately went erratic and started yelling at me saying, "" he doesn't do that for me, we're just going to go home."" So I said fine I don't care. So by this time it's about six am and she goes to a coffee shop or something like that. 
 A few hours later she sends me this really hateful text saying, "" I don't know why we bothered on comping up you obviously didn't want us her and for other reasons as well. So I said, mom all I asked if you was to not let the dog out let me take him out. I asked you to out of courtesy and respect to agree to my request. She sends me another text message that's hateful and I just ignore it. So when she gets back from the cafe my parents leave. On Sunday she starts sending me recipes and cute pictures of my dog. I told her I'm very upset with you you owe me an apology. I was dealing with a horrible migraine yesterday probably from all of the stress so I fired back you're mean and hateful.

How to fix it?,"Multiple researches put Philippines as number one plastic pollutant in the world. Philippines dump into the ocean almost 3 times as much plastic as India, while having 10 times less population. 

https://preview.redd.it/mjvfxqiwfmxf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83c8a6ac96f2587b775aa275803e1f83b8a0e4f

There are multiple reasons for that, but the main one is the sachet culture. Filipinos used to buy things from shampoo to coffee in small sachets good for 1-2 times use. Those sachets are often discarded on the streets or canals, and end up in the ocean shortly. 

Those are the facts. But the solution is much harder. A typical solution would be to introduce a sachet tax making it more economical to buy larger quantities. Combined with ban on single-use plastic, strict anti-littering laws enforcement, and proper waste management programs, it would be able to drastically reduce the pollution. 

However, Philippines is a democracy, more or less, and politicians rely on masses, mostly poor, to get into their offices. A sachet tax would be viewed as ""anti-poor"", and enforcement is not welcomed. Puerto Princesa banned single-use plastic bags years ago, I am still offered a single use plastic bag without asking for it every single time I buy something in a sari-sari store, even if it's a single can of cola. 

Unfortunately, it seems that Filipinos are not aware of their leadership position in the world, and do not see plastic pollution as a problem. And even those who see, would not agree to spend more to eliminate it. ",0,1761557236.0,Philippines,2,0.5,False

It wasn’t some dramatic soap opera, just an old man who looked guilty. He told me that he didn’t abandon my husband; his ex (my husband’s mom) moved states and blocked contact when he remarried. I didn’t know who to believe, but I didn’t tell my husband right away because I knew it would explode.

Two days ago, I finally told him. He lost it. He said I “betrayed” him and “sided with the enemy.” He’s been sleeping on the couch and told me to “never speak to his father again.”

We haven’t yet stolen sideways glances or shared wine, but the words we share in silence hold that same deep intimacy, even as we reach across distance. You are everywhere, softening the dark corners under my ribs, a warmth that gently seeps through the coldest hours.

I won’t lie and say it’s been easy, because it hasn’t. Between misunderstandings, wounds, and ache, we have hurt each other, whether intended or not, it happened and I’m sorry for every moment I made it harder to breathe, for every word that missed its mark or fell heavy in the space between us. I’m sorry for every misunderstanding that widened the distance, for the ache I added to your own. I know neither of us can rewind that and I need you to know; my heart has never been careless with you. In fact, my caution at times was the culprit; the truth is, I was scared to lose you in this lifetime too and scared for us to carry the ache of absence again.

Even through the distance and trials we have faced, my love, I still choose you, not in some fever-dream of perfection, but in the true, honest way two hearts return again and build home. If you ever wondered whether anyone would truly choose you, knowing the weight of the ache, the answer is yes, darling. I choose you, over and over, in every uncertain hour, in every vision of tomorrow.

I walk with you in the quiet corridors of my mind, sharing laughter I imagine between us over coffee, the way your eyes might crease when you’re tired, the comfort of leaning shoulder to shoulder, saying nothing, just letting the world be gentler together for a while.

I ache to learn the language of your hand in mine, sharing laughter, tears, and quiet, but even now, you are here, carried gently in my longing, a warmth I refuse to give up, the one I my heart chooses again and again, even in the dark.

I hope you find this and I hope to one day share these words with you in a more personal way. Know that somewhere, someone carries the memory of you before memory, choosing you gently, again and again. I wait for you in the in-between, hand and heart extended, hoping we can stay in the dance together, side by side.

Always yours,",6,1761556367.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False
1oh9m31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1oh9m31/is_there_such_a_thing_as_romanticizing_pregnancy/,Is there such a thing as romanticizing pregnancy and life after having a baby? (positive “life after baby” stories!),"My partner (35 M) and I (30F) have been together for almost 6 years, and we agreed to start trying for a baby in January. We got all the “practical” things sorted out. We are an amazing team as far as chores, household stuff, and any of these “practical” things go. He just does what needs to be done, and we are both financially stable and just overall in a good place in our lives. My partner also has a really good job that basically means he can be fully home 2 weeks a month, which I assume can make things easier on both of us.

My question is, how much can you actually romanticize these things? I obviously know that labor and delivery can be hard, PP can be hard, newborns are unpredictable, and you just can't be fully prepared ever. I just kind of imagine that we would just go with the flow, make our walks with a stroller into a coffee date, still plan trips once we feel comfortable travelling with the baby, I can still dress cute and have a clean house, have a fav TV show ect. (just giving a very rough idea of things that have been on my mind). I obviously know that anything can happen, but I am a very “grass is green where you water it” kind of person, and I just feel like life with a baby CAN actually be fun and you dont need to loose yourself and your relationship to a baby. 

Am I absolutely delusional, or can life and relationship after a baby actually be positive and in rare moments maybe even aesthetic? I am also just asking out of curiosity and I am an educated person that knows that life is not a highlight reel, and having a baby is a very serious decision that has a huge impact on your life and puts a strain on your relatiship. I am just trying to find the good in a scary change. 

I would like to hear some positive stories about how parenthood changed your life for maybe the better even?

1oh9i0g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh9i0g,I visited 7 taco shops (+plus more) during my 3 day trip to LA,"My buddy ""**D**"" and I landed in LA around 11 a.m., grabbed our rental, and went straight into the food mission. Here's a quick rundown of the 3-day taco-and-cocktail marathon.

# Day 1

We hit **Holbox** right away. There was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly. We were ordering within 20 minutes.

**TACO #1) Holbox** To share, we got the **Ceviche de Mero** (pic #2). For tacos, I had the **Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni** (pic #1) and the **Smoked Kanpachi Taco** (pic #3), while D went for the **Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta** and **Taco de Pescado al Carbon** (pic #4). We ordered the tostada without realizing how similar it is to ceviche. Honestly, I think we could've just shared the ceviche and ordered more tacos. The tacos were on another level. I was surprised by how the octopus melts in my mouth. All the tacos had such an incredible depth of flavor.

After that, we did the whole tourist thing (Blue Bottle Los Feliz, Griffith Observatory) and met up with my friend ""**J**,"" who lives in LA. He took us for dinner at **Seong Buk Dong**. We ordered the *galbi-jjim*, grilled mackerel, and *fermented soybean stew* (not pictured). As a Korean with a fantastic cook for a mother and grandmother, I can say this place is legit. It was like eating at my grandmother's place.

J then took us around town:

* **Alma's Cider & Beer:** The 'Son of Man' cider was unique and delicious.
* **Real Charmer:** We ordered the Savory Bay and the **High Tea** (pic #5). High Tea was something else. D suggested nibbling on the biscuit first, then sipping the drink. Doing so elevated the experience from 80% to 150%. The way it changed the flavor profile in my mouth was insane—like an extremely delicious dessert at a fancy hotel high tea.

The night ended with a late-night taco pit stop:

**TACO #2) El Flamingo Los Feliz** We got the **Asada** and **Al Pastor** (pic #6) to go. Maybe it's because we didn't eat them on the spot, but they were just standard good—nothing mind-blowingly good. The sauces were solid, though.

# Day 2

We kicked off the day with J and D at **Sqirl**. We ordered the Crispy Rice Salad, Famed Ricotta Toast, and the Shaq (pic #7). Their Iced Americano (not pictured) was also surprisingly great. We even saw chatted with one of my favorite music artists—LA things, I guess.

We then hit up The Broad, grabbed some great horchatas (the empanadas were just okay), and stopped by The Last Bookstore and Guisados before J took us to **Sonoratown**.

**TACO #3) Sonoratown** We ordered six tacos total (four **Asada** in pic #8). My friend mentioned that Sonoratown drives down to Mexico for fresh ingredients weekly, and I believe it. The tortillas were really good. The asada was phenomenal, and I totally get why J ordered two. The cabbage was a nice touch, and the tacos felt incredibly well put together. We inhaled them.

After tacos, J took us to the Arts District:

* **Manuela** (pic #9): A super cool, beautiful, hip, and trendy spot. The vibe felt very ""SoCal"" for this Vancouver-based Canadian. I loved the **Florida Man cocktail** (pic #10). We shared the Smoked albacore dip (pic #11) and Louisiana shrimp aguachile (pic #12). Excellent food and drinks. I'd come back in a heartbeat.
* **Arts District Brewing Company:** We got to watch the end of Game 2 (Dodgers vs. Blue Jays) here. The crowd's atmosphere during the seventh inning was electric and unforgettable. 
* **The Wolves** (pic #13): I had this one on my list, and J backed it up. He recommended the **'Tigers Milk' cocktail** (pic #14). This is a contender for my personal ""Cocktail of the Year"" list, rivaling the Caprese cocktail I had at Zest Seoul earlier this year. The smoke, the fatty, but clean richness was a mouth-sensation with every sip.

But wait, there's more...

**TACO #4) Tacos 1986** We each got one **Adobada** and one **Carne Asada** (pic #15). I liked the Asada better, and it was really good, but I personally preferred Sonoratown's Asada a lot more.

**TACO #5) El Taurino** We each had one **Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Cabeza, and Lengua** (pic #16). To me, this is what a classic, essential, OG taco should look like. The **Cabeza and Lengua** were my favorites here. The sauces were great, though the red one was a little too spicy for me.

# Day 3

We started the day with a perfect **Iced Mint Mojito** coffee (pic #17) from **Philz Coffee**. Very refreshing and a great kick-start.

**TACO #6) Carnitas El Momo** We got breakfast here. We tried the **Carne (pork shoulder) & Buche (pork belly) mi** (pic #18) and the **Carne & Cuero (pork skin) mix**. They were huge and juicy. The Carne & Buero had a bit of a pork smell to it, so I personally preferred the Carne & Buche. It was perfect with the sauces but almost *too* big for me.

We then checked out Smorgasburg at The Row. We were stuffed, so we just shared some churros from El Moro (after a 30-minute wait) and a wild Mango Lassi Nectar from Kavahana.

**TACO #7) Mariscos Jalisco** For our final meal, we shared the **Poseidon Tostada** (pic #20) and got two **Tacos de Camaron (Shrimp Tacos)** (pic #19) each. The tostada was complex, spicy, and delicious. The shrimp tacos were a complete surprise—the only crunch taco we had on the trip. I was surprised by the paste-like texture of the inner meat. The sauces on top perfectly complemented the hard shell and hot meat paste inside. So good.

# The Taco Rankings

1. **Holbox** and **Sonoratown** (TIE)
2. **Mariscos Jalisco** and **El Taurino** (TIE)
3. **Tacos 1986**
4. **Carnitas El Momo**
5. **El Flamin Taco** (This one's a bit unfair, as it was the only one I had *to go* and ate at the hotel.)

# Regrets & Missed Opportunities

* **Porto's Bakery:** I regret not getting to visit since the hotel was in Glendale. 
* **Father's Office:** The one nearby was unfortunately shut down. I love the dry-aged burger.
* **Holbox:** I should have just shared one ceviche and ordered more tacos instead of the tostada.
* **In & Out:** A California ritual I missed out on, but oh well. 
* **Desserts:** Too busy eating tacos!",14,1761555858.0,FoodLosAngeles,0,0.94,False

It’s better to just write just one issue at a time.  So if you think you saw this before, you may have.  I am also only writing about one issue here but there are many others that can’t be included because this is far too long as it is. We will call my husband Will. 

A few relevant facts about me so that you know some basics of my life and some of Will’s frustrations with me:

1. I was a stay at home mom till very recently.

2. I don’t drive.

3. I am terrible with finances.

4. I have always been an absentminded and messy person. You can generally tell how I am doing emotionally by the state of my “personal spaces.” When things are good, spaces are clean with just some clutter here and there. When things are bad, spaces are sometimes downright slovenly.

﻿
﻿Will lied a lot from the beginning of our marriage. About stupid things. Like going to Jack in the Box or meeting a friend for coffee.  We also started out really broke but Will started making more money and becoming more well known in his field. He worked on several big movies before getting on the project that really changed his career and our lives. He went from making semi-okay money and being relatively unknown to making good money and being very well known in his industry. He still lied during this time. At this point, it’s a feature of Will. He works and he lies about things.

Once Will started making good money, he expected me to know how to manage it. When we were broke, we were both involved with the finances and jointly knew nothing and fucked up together. But when he started making good money, he expected me to manage it alone. I should have learned how to do this. I didn’t. I made sure things were paid and that my daughter had everything she needed. When he was on a movie, we could generally stockpile 12k in a couple months without even needing to really cut back. But then the movie would end and he would be off for three months. We would spend that money and sometimes go into debt. Then he would get on a movie and we would spend a few weeks/a month getting out of debt and stockpiling 10-15k again. I didn’t know how to manage finances when I couldn’t anticipate what was coming in. I should have sought outside help but I didn’t see it as a problem till far too late.

Me not driving cost us a lot of money. My daughter was in an expensive sport that had long practices  almost daily and I used Uber/lift to get us there and anywhere else we needed to go. At one point, we were spending close to 1k/month on Uber alone. I don’t blame my choice to not learn to drive on anyone. I don’t even know why I haven’t. All I do know is that I have had years of opportunity and I have not done it. And this choice cost us a lot of money.

I settled into a lot of bad choices. I got tired of fighting about the way his attitude felt like, “Budgets for thee and not for me!” If he didn’t want us to pinch pennies together, then I just wouldn’t pinch pennies either. He was lying to me and was rarely home and I think the truth of it is that living comfortably made that feel okay. Or, maybe not okay but decent. I kind of told myself that I didn’t need to fight about where my husband was or what he was lying about because my daughter had this amazing life and I could be happy with that. Me being dumb as fuck is a running theme here. I recognize that my own stupidity is maybe even the main problem in all of this.

And then comes Pablo.

Pablo(name changed) is a person who worked in pretty much the same field as my husband. He was one of the more famous guys in this industry and had a huge amount of followers on Instagram(something my husband now noticed and talked about). Pablo was athletic. He was single. And he became Will’s best friend.

From the moment Will and Pablo became friends, Will’s attitude toward me changed. It used to feel like we were working things out but I was angry that he kept lying to me. This switched to feeling like Will had this rage that was always bubbling under the surface and would explode during moments of stress. There was one Christmas when I asked him if we could take the money we would normally spend on gifts and use it for a small trip to San Diego. My daughter couldn’t list a single physical thing she wanted that year and only asked to stay in a hotel. When I brought this up to Williams, he lost it. He screamed, “With what money?? With what money??” and literally backed me into a corner while screaming in my face. He’s not tall but I am quite short and he was towering over me as I tried to shrink into a corner while he was screaming at me. He told me that I was pretty much just a nanny because I couldn’t clean or manage finances(both of which I am legitimately terrible at) and he could hire a nanny to replace me. I told him that I could just take our daughter to spend Christmas in Vegas with my mom and he said he wouldn’t pay for it.

After, I tried to talk about how this altercation scared me. Will would have none of it. He mocked me for being scared of him(because he is not a physically intimidating guy and literally EVERYONE else feels safe around him) and told me that I was trying to make him feel like he was abusive. He would only agree to discuss the situation if I was willing to talk about how I pushed him to that point. I was unwilling to talk about it that way because my entire point was that his reaction should have never been an option. My fear was that this was a point that he COULD be pushed to. In order to feel safe, I needed to know that would never happen again. He refused to talk about it further.

During this time, he was working on the biggest movie of his life. It was a huge cultural phenomenon and he found himself going to award shows, doing interviews, and getting invited into rooms that he never thought he would be in. He would invite me to go with him and I just… couldn’t. I am not particularly social by nature but it also felt impossible to stand by someone who I was starting to feel treated me poorly behind closed doors. I know that some people will feel I am overreacting but that altercation felt violent and it was messing with my mind.

Will started feeling angry that I was “abandoning” him when he was finally reaping the rewards of all the years of work he had put into his craft. I felt like I couldn’t stand by him and have people tell me how great he is and how lucky I am to have him when I didn’t feel that way. His refusal to talk about what happened made me feel silenced and standing by him made me feel complicit in that silencing.

I am sorry this is so long. I am trying to condense.

My husband got our daughter an iPad and used his AppleID to set it up. I was sitting with her one day and a semi-naked photo of a woman comes through. It was from Pablo.

I open the messages and see that Pablo is bragging about this woman to my husband and sending photos of her cooking for him. Over the course of several days, I see that Pablo talks about women extensively to my husband. There were detailed accounts of sexual encounters, rating/ranking women, sending photos to my husband that appeared to have been meant solely for Pablo’s eyes. Once, Pablo even described events that ultimately amounted to stalking a woman and showing up at her apartment unannounced. My husband told him that “she knows she misses that dick.” No condemnation. No push back. I hate even typing this out.

I also found out that Pablo had been either fired or forced out of an adjacent industry because of things that happened in relationships with his colleagues. There was a forum online where Pablo was being discussed as a predator and my husband told Pablo that “the white guys were just jealous they can’t compete with your black dick.”

Will is weirdly obsessed with Pablo’s dick. I have never seen anyone else say shit like that.

When Pablo started sending my husband photos that seemed like they were meant just for Pablo’s eyes, I felt it was necessary to tell Will that I had seen them. I told him that Pablo sending intimate photos of women that were intended for his eyes only was a huge breach of trust. I told him that I realized that this wasn’t a conversation I was supposed to be privy to but that his reaction felt disappointing. No one was standing up for those women and telling Pablo to stop. I told him that the things he said were gross and I expected better of him as a married man.

He lost his SHIT. He told me I didn’t want him to have friends, that I was trying to make him look bad, that this is just how guys talk. He latched on the word “gross” and will randomly remind me of how I called him gross, even to this day. I stand by it. It was gross and weird.

This is getting far too long so I’m just going to say that this continues for two-ish years. Pablo does weird shit, my husband co-signs, I protest, he blows up and blames me. They are weird-ass best friends against the world. In an industry of mostly women, mind you. During the fucking Me-too movement.

One day, my husband comes to me and tells me he needs to say something. He says that I have always had great intuition and he should have trusted me. He said that there is a woman who has created an instagram page dedicated to exposing Pablo. Apparently she and other women were uniting because of their experience with Pablo. These women had been stalked, bullied, and threatened with the release of their intimate photos. My husband acted gobsmacked. Why? I don’t know. They literally just wrote down the shit we already knew years ago. But he was pretend gobsmacked and I heard him out. He said he should have listened to me and that it is news to him that Pablo is a bad person. But then he also told me that the woman who started the page is a crazy 22 year old who is doing this to be malicious. That seemed like weird information to know, so I asked him if he had spoken to her. He was like, “no! I would never! That’s crazy.” I accepted that for a while but my gut kept gnawing at me. I told him that I was sorry to ask again but my intuition has never failed me and it was calling bullshit. He looked me in my eye and told me he never spoke to her. He told me how this is probably just a residual feeling that comes from the lies he has told in the past. He told me that even though he picks up the weight of that burden every day, it is hard on him to know I don’t trust him when he is telling the truth. He told me that it is probably even more difficult for me to trust because my father wasn’t in my life but that it’s still hard for him to have to hold that weight. 

Two days later, the girl makes a post calling my husband out for continuing to contact her and threaten her with legal action. Lol. So not only was he calling her, he was trying to silence her, too.

When I brought this up to Will, he said that he only got involved because she is pretending to be a victim and she didn’t really feel taken advantage of, she was just trying to get revenge. She, the 22 year old young woman, was trying to vilify him, the 40 year old married man with all the industry contacts and good reputation. He would only agree to talk about it if we talked about how blindsided he was and how shocked he must be to find out his friend is trash. Wild.

He would also tell me he didn’t have time to discuss any of this with me but would then be in Zooms with other industry people talking about what a betrayal this is and how he was as shocked as they were. Fucking HOW? My husband was pretty much the one person who definitely DID know. And the stupid piety he had afterward was unbearable. There was an award show he was going to and he wanted to wear his Time’s Up pin and asked me to help fasten it to his lapel. I wanted to stab him with it.

I don’t know why this broke me as much as it did. Something inside of me just gave up. I stopped leaving the house. I became so afraid of seeing anyone we jointly knew so I stopped going outside. I hated the thought of being around anyone because the main thing people talk to me about is how amazing he is and how lucky I am. I’m naturally awkward and I make people feel uncomfortable and it started to feel unbearable that the thing people seemed to like most about me is that I am married to him. It made me feel like I was stuck inside skin I couldn’t shed. 

There was also the guilt. My husband knew all of this ahead of time. So did I. Neither of us said shit. I didn’t track those women down on socials and let them know what was being said and shared about them. I just rolled over and let it all happen. Will was getting these messages two years prior to when all of this came out publicly. That was two years of trauma that might not have happened to someone if either of us had said something. But we didn’t and now I feel guilty and Will’s pontificating on the internet so that people will tell him how great he is.

When I have posted about other issues in the past, people say leave the marriage. And I feel that, that resonates with me, but I’ve left my HOUSE like six times in the past six months. My stretch goal in therapy is just going back to the DMV. It was huge progress for me to just get a remote job and talk to people other than my daughter every day. I’m trying to make this as light and silly as I can but I don’t know if I am  also articulating how poorly I am doing mentally. I keep going online and asking people if I am overreacting but I think I am more trying to understand if it is justifiable for me to be as emotionally wrecked as I am. I don’t understand how issues that don’t even sound that bad on their own have fucked me up this badly. My therapist recommended EMDR because she says I have ptsd and that feels wild because how could I have ptsd when nothing has actually happened to me? I can’t even imagine telling anyone in real life because it sounds ridiculous.  Like, as a kid, my mom beat my ass to the point CPS was called repeatedly and I came out of that with just fast reflexes. But I got ptsd while inside my house in the suburbs because my husband lied to me a lot? I’ll have to take that to my gave. 

I can’t wrap my head around how I got here and I don’t know what to do next. My plan so far has been get a job and don’t die and although I am super happy to be able to check those things off, leaving the marriage feels like skipping some steps. 

Absolutely any advice would be appreciated. Is there anyone who thinks this is salvageable? I genuinely don’t know what to do.

I was in a relationship for a year. She put me under pressure to tell her I love her. Truth is, i never did and she made it difficult to have feelings for her. She was Very selfish on every aspect. Never paid me a coffee, never suggested to do anything because it meant she will pay. I was always suggesting we do things and she never ever bothered pulling her wallet as a sign of willingness to pay her part. I grew hate and disgust towards her which even got worse when she pushed me towards an open relationship. I was fine with it since i was travelling. At the time, I didn’t expect that she’ll be looking to sleep with dudes like right away and have many hookups. As soon as we discussed it, she was on tinder meeting mainly men, which i also didn’t care about. At one point she had 3 hooks in one week. I was sick to my stomach. This person is never full. Always wants more as long as it’s free and they pay her a drink. Then i realized that she’s a cheap person. The type you pay them a drink and they will do the star fish for you.
She was selfish in bed. We would go to her friend’s and she won’t even bring beer to drink. She would just stand there waiting for them to offer her. I was embarrassed so I stopped going because it would mean that i need to buy the beer to avoid looking cheap.

I’m five years post this relationship and i think I’m traumatized. I’m trying to put myself out there again but right now, i feel like i shifted to the other side and set high expectations for future dates. I want to be paid for a coffee, a nice dinner and things like that. If someone can’t afford that then i wouldn’t bother dating them.
I’m typically the kind that likes to give away a lot and it doesn’t bug me if the other person show initiative of wanting to pay, or wanting to give back.

I’m sad, stuck and feel disgusted by staying with this person and lying to them.

I don't know the exact square footage but the living/bedroom area is very small. We have a queen-sized bed and 3-seat couch with a tv and coffee table, so think of it as a decent single-bed hotel room with a large chef's kitchen. The place was originally built as a pool house so it has a regular kitchen and a regular bathroom. The living room just doubles as a bedroom because they weren't expecting people to move in when they built it. The plusses are that the ceilings are over 12ft tall, there are massive windows, and a backyard we could walk around on a leash. We both love cats and even though the space is small we would love to offer some cats a home, especially because we're in LA so it's constantly breeding season. We work for 8-ish hours a day so we thought getting 2 would be better than 1 so they could entertain eachother when we were gone but again the space is small. I know the litter box 2+1 rule, and I genuinely don't know if we would have the space for 3. I think we could do 2 though. The other consideration is I'm moderately allergic to cats so 2 in a small space could be a lot of dander but we clean a lot and are looking into feeding Purina LiveClear or Pacagen.

Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started exploring coffee beyond instant and want to get into brewing at home. I’m looking for some advice on what would be the best brewing method for a complete beginner — something that’s easy to learn, affordable to set up, but still gives a genuinely good cup. 


Ideally, I’d like something that:

Doesn’t require a ton of expensive gear

Is easy to clean and maintain

Lets me actually taste the flavor of the beans (not just bitterness)


Also, I’m curious about Indian coffee beans — what would you recommend for someone new? I’ve come across brands like Blue Tokai, Sleepy Owl, KC Roasters, and Third Wave. I generally prefer a medium or medium-dark roast with a balanced but slightly strong taste (not overly bitter or sour).

Would love to hear your thoughts on:

Which brewing method makes the most sense for a beginner

Which Indian beans or blends to start with

Where to buy them (online or in stores)

Any starter gear or grinder recommendations

I (37F) and my husband (38M) have been together for over 10 years. We have a 3yo and I am 8mo pregnant. My husband has been very absent this pregnancy. We have had relationship therapy in the past and resumed it for a little while at the start of our pregnancy. I won't go into too much detail, other than to say that we both needed to improve. There was a point though where I told him either leave now or decide to have this baby with me and be there for our family, he chose the second.

I had a bit of a rough patch during my pregnancy but I feel a bit better now. Have been on sick leave since the start of the summer though, so experiencing being a sahm now. My husband meanwhile landed a new very demanding job this summer and he is also politically active, causing him to be away from home a lot. He does spend some time with our oldest on Friday and Sunday. And when he is home at night he will do part of her bedtime routine. Toddler still goes to daycare twice a week which is when I work hard (with my mom and brother) to prepare our home for baby and try to rest up a little bit. We also try to give each other some space to spend time with friends and do family visits together. I try to help him as much I can by letting him sleep at least once a week (I try to too but mostly fail), small things like serving him coffee, packing his bag when he goes out with LO or by helping him with work emails etc. 

Household chores and all emotional labour and everything else that comes with preparing for baby and raising our toddler lands on me, and I can't take it anymore. I have tried in so many ways to explain to him that he needs to step up, that I can't do all this while I am supposed to be on leave to be able to recover and rest. That I would be so happy if he even offered me any emotional support, even the smallest things like asking how I am doing or offering me a drink. That it would help if I didn't have to ask him multiple times to take out the trash, that loading and unloading the dishwasher when he is at home would already make a difference. I tried telling him how sad I am about the fact that we took a weekend off together in two weeks to have soms sort of babymoon but that nothing is planned bc he did not plan anything and ignored/dissaproved all of my suggestions when I was trying to plan it. I tried asking him to take a day off to hang the curtains and raise our bed but he will say he'll look at it later and then doesn't. Anytime I bring up my worries, be it in person or written, or even if I cry in front of him he will ignore me. Sometimes he will say that he is ashamed and overwhelmed and he feels I don't listen to his feelings enough, but then he shuts down again. Otherwise he just pretends like nothing happened, he will talk to me and text me about other stuff such as his work and the news and try to joke around and cuddle etc. He did come with me to all baby appt and there he plays the model husband. He was not like this before, I mean it has been growing overtime but this level of not caring I would have never expected of him.

I don't know what to do anymore bc I can't seem to reach him. I feel like I have tried everything, from being super empathetic and careful to being blunt and directive. I am super worried about everything that still needs to happen and also I am so so tired and stressed about how this will be when baby is here.

So the only thing that comes to mind now, is to make him feel what he refuses to see. I want to stop cooking and stop doing daily cleaning. Like yes I will sort out baby clothes but no I will not do the dishes anymore, just wash mine and my toddlers plate and cup so we have that to eat from. And I know he really likes meaty warm dishes, so I decided to resort to cold salads and veggie soup and bread for dinner starting tonight. I am not going to wash and fold his clothes anymore, I won't ask him to take out the trash and let it just pile up, I am not stocking up on his snacks anymore. It feels so so petty to do this but I can't think of anything else? I don't want to punish him but I want him to understand and at least not ignore me anymore. And at least this way I preserve some of my energy but also I know it's going to stress me out again. Have any of you been in this position, what works?

I am posting this on daddit bc I want to understand what is going on with him. I am not looking to leave him bc I know the loving man that is in there somewhere and also I need him to be there for our kids. But I need some sort of progress.

Tldr; 8mo pregnant and husband totally ignores my needs, I want to stop doing chores bc I feel like there is nothing else I can do anymore, but it feels so petty. Already did couples therapy before. Not looking to divorce, I want to resolve this. Advice welcome.

I opened the door, threw my stuff in, sat down, and plugged in my phone. About ten seconds later, I noticed something weird, there was a child’s car seat in the back. I don’t have kids. Then I realized… there was also a pair of pink sunglasses on the dash.

At that exact moment, someone knocked on the window. It was my neighbor. I had just broken into her car. I screamed, threw my coffee all over the seat, and jumped out like I’d been caught committing grand theft auto. She laughed so hard she had to lean on another car.

Hey everyone,

I (18M) just started college a few months ago. I’ve been on a few dates before and had some talking stages, but I’ve never actually dated anyone or done anything physical with a girl.

There’s this girl I met recently, I saw her in the dining hall and thought she was really pretty. I wanted to up to her but when me and my roommate put our food down she was done eating and left. Luckily, my roommate knew she went to his highschool but didn’t know her name. So after some looking,  We got her Instagram and  I DMed her.

I found out we’re both pre-med and taking the same classes, so I asked if she wanted to study together. We went on the “study date”, I paid for coffee, we studied for about 90 minutes until the shop closed, then grabbed dinner at the dining hall and ended up talking for another 3 hours (basically until close and long after we were done eating).

I got her number at the end, and we planned to watch a show together later that week.

During our second “date,” I brought her to this bench on campus which is a little in nature but a little private. she sat really close to me and we were touching a bit. She’d playfully hit my arm when she got excited about the show (I’ve already seen it). She got cold at one point, so I gave her my jacket and told her to keep it until next time. We hung out for about 5 hours

I really like her and want this to be a slow burn, I don’t want to rush anything, but I also want my intentions to be clear. One-on-one hangouts like this don’t feel casual to me, but I’m not sure if she feels the same way or just sees it as friendly.

What should I do next ( I’m seeing her tmrw)
	How can I gradually progress things physically like small milestones  (hand-holding, sitting closer, etc.) without coming off too strong?
	What signs should I look for to know she’s comfortable or interested in more?

She’s everything I’ve been looking for in a potential partner, and I don’t want to mess it up by moving too fast or being too passive.

Or just complaining- but I’m heavily frustrated by my parents planning, and time schedule. They feel like teenagers a bit, and I don’t necessarily feel prioritized…or wanted, I guess.

Me and my fiancé work strict schedules (5:00 - 2:45) which includes waking up early, it’s fine, but because of this we don’t have that much free time or wiggle room.

Once we get back from work, he takes classes and I have to clean / cook dinner with leftovers we can take to work the next day.

My parents are both unemployed, with no strict schedule. They go to bed at around midnight to 2 am, and don’t wake up until maybe 12 pm.

I want to spend time with them, occasionally, such as today and I ask the night before, but they always wake up too late, or expect me to bend to their schedule instead of the other way around.

It just feels frustrating they sleep so long, I guess.

And, when I want to spend time with them, maybe go for coffee, they aren’t willing to wake up early or adjust scheduling.

1oh90hk,https://i.redd.it/8l47gtyz7mxf1.jpeg,Coffee consumption is associated with increased brain white matter integrity & cortical thickness,"The study found that coffee drinkers tend to have better brain structure.

White matter — basically the brain’s wiring network — showed greater integrity, meaning stronger connections and better communication between regions.

They also had slightly higher cortical thickness, which is the outer layer of the brain involved in memory, attention, and reasoning. A thicker cortex is often linked to a healthier brain and slower cognitive decline.

The effect increases up to around 3–5 cups a day, then stabilizes.

Why? Caffeine may boost cerebral blood flow and protect neurons from oxidative stress, while coffee’s polyphenols add antioxidant benefits.

Of course, it’s a correlation, not proof of cause and effect — coffee drinkers often have other lifestyle habits that matter too.

And too much coffee (over 5–6 cups daily) can have the opposite effect: anxiety, poor sleep, etc.",31,1761553848.0,Biohackers,15,0.91,False

Hey everyone,

I (18M) just started college a few months ago. I’ve been on a few dates before and had some talking stages, but I’ve never actually dated anyone or done anything physical with a girl.

There’s this girl I met recently, I saw her in the dining hall and thought she was really pretty. I wanted to up to her but when me and my roommate put our food down she was done eating and left. Luckily, my roommate knew she went to his highschool but didn’t know her name. So after some looking,  We got her Instagram and  I DMed her.

I found out we’re both pre-med and taking the same classes, so I asked if she wanted to study together. We went on the “study date”, I paid for coffee, we studied for about 90 minutes until the shop closed, then grabbed dinner at the dining hall and ended up talking for another 3 hours (basically until close and long after we were done eating).

I got her number at the end, and we planned to watch a show together later that week.

During our second “date,” I brought her to this bench on campus which is a little in nature but a little private. she sat really close to me and we were touching a bit. She’d playfully hit my arm when she got excited about the show (I’ve already seen it). She got cold at one point, so I gave her my jacket and told her to keep it until next time. We hung out for about 5 hours

I really like her and want this to be a slow burn, I don’t want to rush anything, but I also want my intentions to be clear. One-on-one hangouts like this don’t feel casual to me, but I’m not sure if she feels the same way or just sees it as friendly.

What should I do next ( I’m seeing her tmrw)
	How can I gradually progress things physically like small milestones  (hand-holding, sitting closer, etc.) without coming off too strong?
	What signs should I look for to know she’s comfortable or interested in more?

She’s everything I’ve been looking for in a potential partner, and I don’t want to mess it up by moving too fast or being too passive.

Any advice on pacing, or reading her signals?

I don't know if it flows OK, or if the thoughts and dialogue are any good. The backstory is the character Liz is potentially being stalked, by someone who sends letters to her. 



Chapter 23 ~ What goes around, comes around!

It had been days, and Doug had heard nothing. Not that he cared, not that he had ever cared, at least that is what he told himself. But Col was nearby each of the eight to ten times that he had gone to check with reception that no mail had come for him, but was accidently left there instead of going to his room. 

I’m not crazy, and I'm not bothered whether she answers or not. But if she does answer I …. Well it's just polite isn't it to read what is said. It's not like anything is going to happen. I'm not being obsessive about going to the reception, it's just, well sometimes mail doesn't always get to my flat. So I'm just being proactive, Oh bother, there he is again. Every single time, Just standing there, watching, leaning against the reception desk. Hell, what am I going to say now?


Col had watched Doug make his way to reception  every day since the day after Doug posted his envelope. Which of course was ridiculous as he was checking for a reply before his letter would even have arrived. But Col just stood, sunglasses on, leaning against the desk in reception, arms folded, and ankles crossed, waiting.

Annoyingly, Doug couldnt stop thinking about the file Col had and the memories of the past that it brought to the surface. 

Carol was his friend, his best friend, he was dumb, stupid, immature and as Col had said a coward. He was also scared, and did exactly what his mum said, she was trying, in her own way to minimise the suffering she knew Doug would face at the hands of his father, if he ever found out. The beating he got from his dad when he di find out was immeasurable. Two broken ribs, black eyes, bruising round his chest from the kicking, facture collar bone and multiple fractures in his arm and hands, which had never properly healed. The shame his family felt, the arrangements his mum agreed to, that would probably save his life, even if it meant he was no longer there beside her, not that he ever told Carol these things. He never told her, he really did care. By the time he was old enough to figure it out, he figured it was too late to matter. 

He asked his mum once if she knew how they were doing. Carol, and his daughter, she told him, they were better without him. At the time, he thought she meant it, years later, he wondered if his mum feared he would become like his dad. A mean man saddled with a wife and child he didn't want, who took it out on them at every opportunity he could. But Doug, as much as he was a coward, he was many things, but violent was not one of them. He backed away from confrontation, ran from it, never towards it, never towards any form of challenge. Until now, that is, and that was that weird man Col's fault. 


Col, whoever he was, had told Doug the truth, that his mum had been afraid of who he might become, and was ashamed of his actions in getting some girl pregnant. Because of this, she chose to tell her son they were better off without him, even though she knew that wasn't the case. He had also sent his mum money to give to them, to help. But Col found out, his dad, the control freak, intercepted it, never told his mum, and used to buy the beer he drank before beating her out of pleasure. Until the day she managed to ‘escape’ by passing away from a heart attack. The day she finally found peace, and he hoped, redemption. Doug had not gone back for the funeral, his dad told him he wasn't welcome. His exact words were more like:

“If you turn up here, Ill make you wish you had never been born. The shame you brought that whore you called a mother, was what killed her. Now who is going to make my dinner, your a complete waste of space. Anyway, she’s not being buried, that woman had enough of my money over the years. Tricking me into marrying her by getting pregnant, Ill either flush her ashes, or get the council to deal with them. I only need to make sure things look right, without spending another penny on the useless woman.”

Doug had not listened to the whole rant, but had put the receiver on the table and just let his dad ramble. Until finally the man knew no one was listening, and finally hung up. He died, not six months later of pancreatic cancer.

Doug had asked Col, how he knew and what evidence he had, which he regretted immediately. Col turned to him, took off his sunglasses, looked at Doug with piercing blue eyes that had the depth of eternity radiating from them, whilst replying, I told you, I'm the collector. 

Now, he was waiting every day, in the hope, yes hope, that it wasn't too late.

I wonder if she will reply, probably not, I mean who would after all i did? Even if she just replies to tell me to get lost, at least I will know she read the letter, or I hope she does. What if I hear nothing? Oh God, that will be worse, never knowing if she got the letter, read it, or if it got lost. I know I deserve it, but I don't know if I could live with it.


She was the only real friend I ever had, I hope that somehow she forgives me for making such a monumental mess and hurting them both so badly. 

He also hoped he could get to know the daughter he never really wanted to abandon. He hadn't gone with his ‘Uncle’ willingly. He had been thrown in the back of his car, with the broken ribs, the multiple bruises and concussion, because he ‘fell down the stairs.’ His Uncle knew of course, what had happened, that his nephew had got a girl in the family way, and this was to cover the family shame. 


Carol was once again pacing back and forth across her living room, smoking as she ranted internally:

How the hell could he? 

What was he thinking? 

After all this time.

What gave him the right?

Who gave him the right?



Carol spent many days thinking about the letter. 
Well to be more eact, she spent many days pacing up and down, chain smoking and cussing Doug regarding the letter. She knew how Liz felt about it, the swearing, which still hasn't really stopped, showed the intensity of her daughter's reaction.

What was it Liz said:

“Why should I give a damn about what this low life good for nothing coward wants? He didn't want me, why should I care about him, He is scum for leaving you, when you needed him the most. Lower than scum, he shouldn't exist, and doesn't to me. Do what you want mum, I want nothing to do with him.”

Carol didn't blame her, Liz didn't want to know, she didn't want to hear what was in the letter, she wanted nothing to do with someone who didn't want anything to do with her. Carol wasn't going to read it either, but then she spoke to a friend of hers. 

She had known Malachi for almost a year. He was like a wise old man, in a much younger body. He reminded her of the man who helped her all those years ago, when she was a single mum and alone. A man who had found her a job when her mother passed suddenly and she needed to look after her daughter. The funny thing was they were both called Malachi. But she only knew the first Malachi for just a few days, before he left town. This Malachi she had known for nearly a year, he often went off on business, to work, but was always a good listener when he was around. 

Carol bumped into Malachi the day after she received the letter. They met in the library, she went there regularly as she was an avid reader. But had her mind on the letter when she literally walked into him, in the biography aisle. 

“Oft.., sorry,”

Looking up from her dazed position Carol recognised the figure standing nonchalantly beside one of the bookcases.

“ Oh Hi Malachi, its you!”

“Yes it is, are you ok? You were miles away.”

“Honestly, not really. Do you have time for a coffee? I could really do with some advice.”

“Sure, lead the way.”

Carol got her books, then led the way to the nearest coffee shop. After ordering their drinks Malachi went to sit down opposite Carol, as he did so, Carol just blurted the whole thing out, starting with the letter from Doug. Carol had not intended to sya it all like that, but couldn't help it. Malachi had not batted an eyelid, but instead sat and listened as he sipped his coffee and she talked. 

After telling him all about the letter, her past and Doug, she felt completely exhausted. He just sat there and listened, once she had finished. 

“So, what do you think?” Carol said as she finally took a sip of her coffee. She had splashed out on a spiced latte, not her normal go to, but Carol felt the extra sugar was a necessity. And she just fancied it. 

Malachi slowly took another sip of his coffee, then a bite of the lemon muffin, waited a few minutes then said.

“What do I think about what? Opening the letter, or believing this man who walked out on you?”

He replied as if he was uncertain or surprised, and not as if he had been waiting for this question all along. When Carol looked down at her drink, and began to stir it with long slow circles, as she mulled over the question. 


“I would say, throw the letter away if you want. But if you don't open it, you will regret never knowing what he says. You don't have to believe him, you don't have to reply. But you will always wonder what was in it, if you don't know.”

After that the two friends sat in a comfortable silence as they finished their drinks and food.

Carol had been mulling over what Malachi had said all the way home. He was right of course, she would wonder, and it would bother her. So she had decided to open it. 

That's the point she was at now. With the letter in front of her, she had just been sitting. 

“I need a drink if I'm going to do this.”

She stood up, grabbed a glass from the cabinet, the bottle of whiskey, a coaster and sat back down.


Liz stood trying to check the video from the ring door bell, of the last thirty minutes, she had come home, just to check all was ok. There was no post, and the flat looked fine, so she collected some clean clothes, then started to turn back to the door, when she saw a brand new envelope on the floor by her door. It was pale blue, by now she knew the handwriting, but this one was different. There was no address, it was hand delivered. Her hand was shaking at the realisation.

They have been to my house. My home, they have been to my home, whilst I was in, have they been watching me?

Liz spun round and crept to the side of the window. Trying to stay hidden, yet looking out from behind the curtain. 

Are they out there? 

After staring for a while, looking up and down the street and trying to see if she was being spied upon, Liz came out from the behind the curtain, seeing nothing she sat and poured herself  a large whiskey, downed it in one, then poured another before opening the letter and starting to read.


My Dearest Liz.

As I told you, I will never leave you, or forsake you. Call to me and I will answer you. Taste and see that I AM good, behold I stand at the door and knock.

G.

KNOCK KNOCK.

 Once again Liz jumped out of her skin as she heard someone knocking loudly. 

Not long after that the swearing started….Again.

I know I'll check the ring door bell, then I'll call the police, at least I know I'm not going mad, they will be able to see whoever it is on the camera. I will have evidence, this was not all in my head.

But there was no one there. Liz checked 3 times, and kept checking, and checking and checking.

Surely…but this can't be…. How could they… but thats impossible…it doesnt make any sense… 

Liz was pacing again, back and forth, shaking her haed as she went, as if she was trying to, well understand, but she coudnt, it wasnt there when she came in, but then was there. Liz sat down, still staring at the vidoe on her phone, as her hope of being vindicated turned cold, and silent tears began to make their way down her cheek. For one brief moment she had felt the relief, of being able to prove she was not mad, but it had been pulled from under her, she was devastated and could hardly breathe, as she began to turn cold and shiver with the distress.

Enamon walked away with a malevolent smile flickering on his face. He had not managed to take the note, but he had  managed to delete the footage, his skill set meant he could hack practically anything. 

Deleting the video may not stop her, but it will make her question her own sanity, torment her, maybe even tip her over the edge. Perhaps thats all for the best, either way it wil lbe fun to watch. He thought to himself as he crawled back under the rock from whence he came.

1oh8xi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1oh8xi4/post_op_hiatal_hernia/,Post op Hiatal Hernia,"I’m 50 and weighed 250 6 months ago. I’m 9 days post surgery. Just posting in case helps anyone else.
Background I’ve had acid reflux since my teens. I’ve seen a G.I. doctor the same one for the past 25 years I’ve gotten regular endoscopies.  
Recent past : in the past couple years, my acid reflux grew into daily regurgitation and vomiting, nightly vomiting that came in phases, severe coughing they came in phases. My doctor liked to pawn me off to my G.I. my G.I. would pawn me off to my pulmonology and round and round we would  go.

Most recent; I knew I had a hiatal hernia all my life. This doesn’t surprise me as many people have one and don’t even know it. I attempted to exercise regularly. I attempted to lose weight regularly all were very difficult. I was 250 pounds in the summer as time went on with my symptoms. They got worse people At Work noticed I slept very poorly. I made appointments again and again and finally one day I decided I’m going to get a hiatal hernia surgery since I knew I had one my pulmonologist was very happy to send me that directions so I went. I saw a surgeon. There were no preop test however I had on file multiple endoscopies that showed hernia, possibly medium to large. I was told that the hernia can change at any point whether it’s a swallow, test, endoscopy, etc. it could change size during a chest x-ray. It might show a different size so that’s one thing I did not Know. 

Bleeding : I had to add this in. I can’t believe I forgot about it. This is what pushed me to have the surgery. I started coughing up old blood. It doesn’t necessarily look like old coffee grounds. It can look up. It can look like black Hershey syrup you just know it’s not normal. It kinda taste like iron, but this started to happen every seven days and it was disastrous at times I would go to the ER. They would tell me to go see my G.I. doctor. It exhausted me and made my life extremely miserable as if it wasn’t already. Eventually, I self diagnosed myself having Cameron lesions now my surgeon agrees with that is what they are. They are microscopic and hard to find with an endoscopy, but I was coughing up so much blood I’d have to get iron infusions and nervous about passing out, etc. etc. she gave me some medicine eventually my surgeon did to help with those.  She said I should not expect to have that issue after surgery and I have not so far.

I I knew due to my height and weight. It’s more dangerous to weigh more for a surgery so I did my best to lose weight and I did use a GLP one prior to surgery on and off for about three months and I was able to shave off about 30/35  pounds.

Surgery consult: my surgeon was very good so far she explained to me that after the surgery I would need to go on a all clear liquid diet very strict for a minimum of two weeks to give myself every chance to heal that was very important. she suggested a partial Nissan fundiplication application as doing a full one would be high risk for me to undo it. I appreciate it, appreciated her honesty in this and agreed with her. My flap does not work to keep acid down, and this is a way to restrict my esophagus to keep acid down. In addition she would perform pulling down my stomach back out of my diaphragm area.

Post surgery at hospital : I was in a lot of pain. I have not experienced a lot of pain in my life before physically. It was a difficult time at the hospital. I was there for two nights. The surgeon explained that 100% of my stomach was in my chest and had melted two parts of my lungs, and my lungs were partially collapsed as well. She had to do a lot of rearranging and the surgery was overall a success so far. The pain was the worst while at the hospital those three days when I came home things improved, but on day nine there’s still a lot of pain here and there. It’s very difficult to sleep. I do have pain meds, but it is a longer recovery than what I was thinking it would be and that’s OK though. 

Due to my clear liquid diet it’s very restrictive. I do not break it. I am down an additional 12 pounds 13 pounds already. I’m not really excited about that knowing that it will probably be gained back partially by the time we’re done with all this but the less weight on me the better.  I do hope one day to go back on a GLP one. I don’t know if that will be the surgeons recommendation or not. I will follow what she says.

In the hospital, I did have a chest tube in order to drain excess fluids out of my chest that stayed in for one day overnight  . I did have a total of seven incisions, including the chest one. Part of my stomach is indented. I don’t know why I’m not gonna worry about that as I am not a fashion model.

I am very happy to be on this side of things at the hospital. The worst pain was where they did most of the Worker where she is the robot to do the work, but I still have pain on my left side as well. I assume my organs are just trying to settle into their new home I do have breathing exercises I need to do daily. I am expected to walk daily but I’ve noticed I get very tired or pain starts creeping in, but I think it’s just gonna take time. 

It is helpful to have people help you if someone lives with you and is able to help you that is a bonus. It’s difficult to order or bringing groceries or simple things. 

I did not experience as much pain in my shoulders like everyone described I would feel, but I have a feeling it’s because I had more severe pain due to the Work inside of me. I’m not sure don’t care. Just happy about that. 

At home not until week two of recovery that I have started that I noticed anything that I drink whether it’s water or chicken broth I get gas and I fart a lot. I was not a fighter before this. I find that interesting. I don’t enjoy it. I don’t think my coworkers would either ha 

I look forward to getting back to sports someday I know the name of the game in my surgeon made this so clear to me. Do not undo the work if you undo this work it is much much harder and much more painful so I will be careful and take my time in the healing process and she explained it was more important in the 2 to 3 weeks after than any other other times, so I will head her warning on that.
I did have large mesh or a large size mesh that is dissolvable with the stitches will dissolve. I mean to replace the area of my stomach pushed through my esophagus is working so far but now my questions remain. 

I have not yet had my follow up appointment with the surgeon that will be next week. I would like to know so many things but at a minimum I would like to know do I need to schedule follow up appointments with my pulmonologist to make sure my lungs developed back to an adult lungs or fully functional. Do I need to get an endoscopy again soon should I get rid of my previous G.I. doctor being that this is gone on And he didn’t seem to help with anything. 

In summary, sorry for the long typing, but in summary, my hernia wasn’t your typical regular hiatal hernia that was a quick fix but at the same time you don’t want it to get as bad as mine did. I don’t know why my doctors didn’t help me with this sooner, but that doesn’t matter now, but if you do have a hiatal hernia that continually gets worse, the surgery is not supposed to be as bad or as painful as I’ve described. I’ve read many accounts seen many videos where the pain is on day one day two and there’s plenty of pain meds for them and then they go on their merry way and have a great time. I think that’s the more normalexpectation I guess and people older than I am with much more severe issues than I have had this surgery and they do well just follow the doctors orders. Do not consider the surgery a free-for-all to eat whatever you want when you want you still wanna make sure not to upset your stomach all over again there’s no reason for that Godspeed to everybody I hope this helps him.",3,1761553509.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False

I've had Lelit Kate for a while now and I've always had trouble getting good pressure with this machine. It got to the point that I'm getting frustrated each time I use it and think of buying another coffee maker. But decided to give it a go and ask on the internet for advice...

In general, the only way to get good pressure is to put a ton of coffee into the basket. But to the point that it's basically impossible to put the portafilter into the group head (even after I tamp extremely hard with all my force) - and often I fail at it and have to remove some beans but then, I get a pressure of like 1-2 bars. The grinder is set to the finest setting.

Also, not that critical but the built-in grinder is also quite annoying. When I use it, there's no way the coffee won't spill all around. I just can't wrap my head on how you can use it without an additional ring. But even with a ring, some coffee spills outside which is really frustrating. But let's say this is ""solved"" with the ring - although if someone has some additional recommendations or good rings, I'd be more than happy to hear.

I'd really appreciate any advices here because I'm so close to getting rid of this machine and getting a different setup but I really want to give it one, final shot because I fully acknowledge the problem may be on my side (and probably is). Thanks!",2,1761553480.0,Lelit,2,1.0,False

Like, I wake up with this brain fog feeling, and some extrasystoles here and there, then I'd drink my cup of joe and all of this groggy morning stuff clears out, even my skips become less frequent, to the point I forget about them(I'm an overthinker so yeah, I can cause PVCs by just noticing one)

Idk what should I say here though. Could anyone explain this?",2,1761553248.0,mitralvalveprolapse,1,1.0,False

# The #1 Tea for a Healthier Heart, According to a Dietitian

 

# A daily sip that does your heart a favor.

# Key Takeaways

l Green tea supports heart health. Its antioxidants, especially EGCG, help lower inflammation and may reduce the risk of heart disease.

 

l It can improve cholesterol balance. Regular green tea drinkers may see lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and higher HDL (“good”) cholesterol.

 

l Two to four cups a day can make a difference. Swapping sugary drinks for unsweetened green tea offers both heart and energy benefits.

 

Drinking tea can offer multiple benefits when it comes to gut health, inflammation, and even longevity. What’s even more, it can also be a major aid to heart health—specifically green tea. “Green tea would be my choice as a good choice for heart health,” says registered dietitian Dawn Menning, MS, RD. “It’s rich in antioxidants, especially one called EGCG, that can help decrease inflammation which may reduce the risk of heart disease.” To help encourage you to drink more tea, plus inform you about green tea’s impressive health benefits, we asked Menning to break down the link between green tea and improved heart health.

# Why Green Tea Can Boost Heart Health

“Some studies have shown that green tea may be associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels, reduced blood pressure, and improved blood vessel function,” Menning explains. LDL cholesterol—also known as “bad” cholesterol—can cause plaque in the arteries and, as a result, can increase the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions. Drinking more green tea can help curb LDL cholesterol while boosting HDL cholesterol, also known as “good” cholesterol.

 

Additionally, “green tea contains an antioxidant called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which can help reduce oxidative stress that can potentially damage blood vessels and may contribute to heart disease,” Menning says. “Chronic inflammation plays a role in heart disease, and green tea has anti-inflammatory effects that may help reduce inflammatory markers.” Oxidative stress creates an imbalance in the body’s natural ability to neutralize antioxidants, a necessary compound that delays oxidation. By drinking more green tea, you can help regulate the free radicals that cause oxidative stress to begin with—and feel healthier overall.

 

Plus, drinking multiple cups of green tea isn’t just healthy—it’s also encouraged by nutrition experts. “Most studies suggest two to four cups of green tea per day may provide benefits,” Menning says. “Unsweetened green tea can be a healthy habit, especially if it’s a replacement for sugary drinks.” When you’re itching for a caffeinated drink, green tea can provide a quick energy boost without the added sugar from coffee creamers and other artificial sweeteners. So the next time you’ve reached your daily coffee limit, reach for a cup of green tea.",1,1761553157.0,KungFuteas,0,1.0,False
