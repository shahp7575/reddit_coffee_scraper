GG is $10,700 
SS is $7,200

I‚Äôm interested in how GF compares to the Poly. I stayed there last year in a suite and wasn‚Äôt that impressed. It was very crowded and I couldn‚Äôt ever find a chair at the pool. Wasn‚Äôt impressed with the restaurants and didn‚Äôt find it to be a luxury hotel (no bottled water, no robes, didn‚Äôt even put a trash bag in the trash can for you, no coffee station in the lobby of the tower, I could go on‚Ä¶.)

I understand the downside of SS are the buses. Is it possible to use the Minnie service to make this better?

I‚Äôm not concerned about walking. We walked to/from the Poly to MK last year and found it to be NBD. One reason to stay at GF is so we can walk. 

My concern about the GF is that it will be too similar to Poly and I‚Äôm paying $10,700 - that‚Äôs a lot. We will also be buying premier passes.

1ls8ist,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1ls8ist/does_a_keurig_make_cold_coffee/,Does a Keurig make cold coffee?,"As a coffee lover, I've always been curious about different brewing methods, especially when it comes to cold coffee. Recently, I've been wondering if my trusty Keurig can make cold coffee. After doing some research and experimenting, I'm here to share what I've learned.

First off, let's address the main question: Does a Keurig make cold coffee? The short answer is yes, but with some caveats.

Keurig machines are primarily designed for hot coffee, but there are ways to use them for cold brews. The easiest method is to brew a regular cup of hot coffee using your Keurig and then pour it over ice. This gives you an iced coffee, but it's not quite the same as a true cold brew.

If you want a more authentic cold coffee experience, there are K-Cups specifically made for iced coffee. These are designed to brew a stronger, more concentrated coffee that won't get watered down when poured over ice. Some popular brands even offer their own iced coffee K-Cups.

However, it's important to note that this method still involves brewing hot coffee and then cooling it down. True cold brew coffee is made by steeping grounds in cold water for several hours, which gives it a smoother, less acidic taste.

While Keurig machines can make a decent iced coffee, they're not ideal for making large batches of cold brew. If you're a cold coffee enthusiast like me, you might want to consider investing in a dedicated iced coffee maker. These are designed specifically for cold brewing and can make larger quantities at once.

I recently discovered a great selection of iced coffee makers at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have options for every budget and preference, from simple cold brew pitchers to more advanced systems.

One thing I've learned is that having the right equipment can make a big difference in your coffee experience. While my Keurig is great for quick, hot cups of coffee, having a separate iced coffee maker has really upped my cold brew game.

If you're interested in exploring different iced coffee options, I'd highly recommend checking out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have some really cool gadgets that can take your cold coffee to the next level.

In conclusion, while a Keurig can make a decent iced coffee in a pinch, it's not the best option for true cold brew enthusiasts. If you're serious about your cold coffee, investing in a dedicated iced coffee maker might be worth considering. It's opened up a whole new world of coffee possibilities for me, and I think you might enjoy it too.

Remember, good coffee is all about finding what works best for you. Whether that's a quick iced coffee from your Keurig or a smooth cold brew from a specialized maker, the most important thing is that you enjoy it. Happy brewing!",1,1751717713.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I have looked at Aussie support, features that actually matter, pricing transparency, and how well they play with other tools you already use.

If you‚Äôre running a retail store in Australia in 2025, having a solid POS system isn‚Äôt just a nice-to-have anymore ‚Äì it‚Äôs non-negotiable. Whether you‚Äôre slinging streetwear in Fitzroy, managing a boutique in Bondi, or running a chain of bottle-os across Brisbane, your point-of-sale setup needs to pull its weight.

I am talking more than just ringing up sales. Today‚Äôs retail POS systems are your stocktake wizard, staff wrangler, customer memory bank, and back-office buddy rolled into one. But with so many systems out there ‚Äì all claiming to be the best ‚Äì it can be a bloody headache figuring out which one suits your business.

No worries. So let‚Äôs dive in.

# 10 Best Retail POS Systems in Australia 2025

# 1. POSApt ‚Äì Built for Aussie Retail Legends

**Best for:** Aussie-first service, retail stores of all sizes

Do you want a POS that actually gets the Australian retail scene like local pricing, Aussie tax rules, [EFTPOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTPOS) integration, and no weird overseas tech issues? POSApt is your mate.

‚úÖ Cloud-based and mobile-friendly‚úÖ Real-time stock tracking across locations‚úÖ Built-in loyalty, promotions, and customer profiles‚úÖ Works seamlessly with Aussie EFTPOS providers‚úÖ Aussie support team, no midnight calls to the US

POSApt isn‚Äôt trying to be flashy; it‚Äôs built to be fast, reliable, and easy. You can run it on both an iPad and an Android tablet, without worrying about getting locked into expensive hardware contracts. It‚Äôs great for small boutiques, larger chain stores, and even pop-ups. And if you‚Äôve got multiple outlets? Too easy ‚Äì POSApt handles that without blinking.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Transparent monthly fee, no hidden fees or tricky contracts.

# 2. Vend (Now Lightspeed X-Series)

**Best for:** Fashion stores, lifestyle boutiques, homewares

Vend (which got gobbled up by Lightspeed) has long been a favourite in Aussie retail, and for good reason. It‚Äôs slick, stylish, and built to grow with your business.

‚úÖ Beautiful interface ‚Äì easy for staff to pick up‚úÖ Advanced inventory with product variants‚úÖ Loyalty programs, customer tracking, and gift cards‚úÖ Integrates with Xero and MYOB

This one‚Äôs ideal if you‚Äôve got a growing store with lots of SKUs and want a POS that looks as good as it performs. Only downside? It can get a bit pricey once you start adding features.

üí∞ **Pricing:** On the steeper side ‚Äì but worth it if you want premium bells and whistles.

# 3. Square for Retail

**Best for:** New retailers, pop-up shops, simple setups

Square has made a name for itself with its tap-and-go readers and dead-simple setup. Square for Retail adds inventory, staff management, and barcode scanning on top.

‚úÖ Quick to set up ‚Äì you can start selling today‚úÖ All-in-one payments and POS‚úÖ Works well with mobile and iPads‚úÖ Free plan available

Great choice for new store owners or side hustlers who want to keep costs low while getting decent functionality. Just be aware that customisation options are a bit limited, and you‚Äôre locked into Square‚Äôs payment processing.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Free basic plan, paid plans for more features

# 4. Retail Express (by Maropost)

**Best for:** Multi-store retailers, serious scale-ups

Retail Express is like the Swiss Army knife of POS systems. It‚Äôs loaded with features ‚Äì maybe even too many for some small retailers ‚Äì but if you‚Äôve got big ambitions, it‚Äôs a winner.

‚úÖ Multi-store stock management‚úÖ Built-in eCommerce and click & collect‚úÖ Smart reporting and forecasting‚úÖ Powerful back-office tools

It‚Äôs built for serious growth. If you‚Äôre already operating multiple shops or planning to franchise, this is a system that won‚Äôt let you down. The interface isn‚Äôt as pretty as others, but the functionality is top-notch.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Custom quotes based on your setup

# 5. Hike POS

**Best for:** Retailers who sell in-store and online

Hike POS is built with modern retail in mind ‚Äì in-person, online, events, marketplaces‚Ä¶ all of it. If you‚Äôre juggling sales across different platforms, Hike makes it feel seamless.

‚úÖ Multi-channel selling ‚Äì online store included‚úÖ Built-in appointment bookings‚úÖ Click & collect, inventory sync, customer loyalty‚úÖ Works well with Shopify and WooCommerce

It‚Äôs especially handy if you run a hybrid business ‚Äì bricks-and-mortar plus eComm ‚Äì and want everything synced up and working together without drama.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Monthly plans based on number of registers and outlets

# 6. Kounta (Now Lightspeed Restaurant)

**Best for:** Retailers with a food section or caf√© arm

Kounta‚Äôs more known in the hospitality world, but it‚Äôs still a good fit for retail stores that include a caf√© or deli. Think bookstores with coffee bars or grocers with juice counters.

‚úÖ Easy sales interface‚úÖ Smart ordering and kitchen printing‚úÖ Stock management with expiry tracking‚úÖ Detailed reporting

Not ideal for straight-up clothing or general retail, but for those who mix retail with food, Kounta‚Äôs POS blends both sides beautifully.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Tiered plans ‚Äì higher tiers for advanced analytics

# 7. Shopify POS

**Best for:** Online stores expanding into physical retail

If you‚Äôre already running a Shopify online store, adding Shopify POS is a no-brainer. It lets you sell at markets, in-store, or events with all your inventory connected.

‚úÖ Same backend as your Shopify store‚úÖ Easy inventory sync‚úÖ Built-in payments‚úÖ Supports discount codes and gift cards

Best for businesses that are eCommerce-first but want a retail presence too. It‚Äôs not as full-featured as others for physical-only stores, but unbeatable if you‚Äôre already in Shopify‚Äôs ecosystem.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Included with Shopify plans, POS Pro for extra features

# 8. Impos

**Best for:** Specialist retailers, high-traffic environments

Impos is another Aussie company with a solid rep, particularly in fast-paced environments like bottle shops, convenience stores, or any place where you need serious speed at checkout.

‚úÖ Lightning-fast transactions‚úÖ Multi-terminal setups‚úÖ Local support and onboarding‚úÖ Strong hardware options

This one‚Äôs not super DIY ‚Äì you‚Äôll likely need their help setting it up ‚Äì but once you‚Äôre up and running, it‚Äôs solid as a rock.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Custom based on your business needs

# 9. Revel Systems

**Best for:** Retailers needing robust POS + back-office

Revel is a bit of a beast. It‚Äôs packed with features, from advanced reporting to detailed [CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/crm/what-is-crm/) tools, and it runs smoothly on iPads.

‚úÖ Customisable workflows‚úÖ Employee management and permissions‚úÖ Real-time analytics‚úÖ Offline mode

It‚Äôs best for retailers who are pretty tech-savvy or have a tech team helping out. Not the simplest system, but incredibly powerful once you get the hang of it.

üí∞ **Pricing:** On the premium end ‚Äì better for established stores

# 10. Neto (Now Maropost Commerce Cloud)

**Best for:** Aussie retailers with complex product lines

Neto (or Maropost Commerce now) is built for product-heavy businesses with complex needs ‚Äì lots of variants, bundles, or niche setups.

‚úÖ Aussie-made and supported‚úÖ Powerful eCommerce and inventory tools‚úÖ Multi-channel and B2B functionality‚úÖ Wholesale and retail options in one

This one‚Äôs more than just POS ‚Äì it‚Äôs full commerce management. You‚Äôll need to commit to setup time, but the payoff is worth it if your business is complex.

üí∞ **Pricing:** Customised based on business size and scope

# Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right POS for Your Retail Biz

There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to POS systems. What works for a fashion boutique in Melbourne might not suit a rural garden supply store in Dubbo.

Here‚Äôs a quick cheat sheet:

* **Just getting started?** ‚Üí Square or POSApt  
* **Growing fast?** ‚Üí Vend or Retail Express  
* **Going omnichannel?** ‚Üí Hike or Shopify  
* **Running food + retail?** ‚Üí Kounta  
* **Complex stock + B2B?** ‚Üí Neto  

And remember ‚Äì whatever you choose, make sure it integrates with your accounting tools (like Xero or MYOB), your EFTPOS terminals, and ideally, gives you good Aussie-based support. You don‚Äôt want to be stuck on hold at 3 am talking to someone who doesn‚Äôt know what GST even is.

A good POS system doesn‚Äôt just process sales ‚Äì it gives you the insights and control to actually run your business better.

Their hearts belonged to the same woman: Janet Jameson, the butler's daughter.

Even their dying words were the same: Don't marry me.

So in this life, I would not waste my time on anyone who does not truly want me.

""If I must marry for the sake of the family, I choose Samuel Lockwood,"" I told my parents.

""Samuel? Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.

Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.

If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.

Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.

As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.

\*\*\*

Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.

Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""

Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""

""Because...""

Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.

In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.

Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride‚Äîeach of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.

In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.

However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.

Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara‚Äîanother match arranged by her family.

However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident‚Äîall for Janet.

Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.

This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together‚Äîuntil Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.

""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""

It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.

That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""

Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.

Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.

Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.

She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.

She did not want someone who did not want her.

So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.

""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""

Brent and Cassandra were stunned.

""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""

Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.

If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.

Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.

As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.

Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.

""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves‚ÄîSamuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""

Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.

After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.

""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""

When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.

Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.

Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.

Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.

Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.

""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""

They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.

The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.

Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.

Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.

Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.

In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.

Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.

That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.

After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.

""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""

Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.

However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.

""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.

Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.

""Which hospital?""

There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.

Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""

Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.

""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""

""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""

They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth‚Äîthey were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.

How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.

As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.

Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.

By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.

""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""

Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.

She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.

Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.

Each box held the gift she had received at 18‚Äîone from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.

Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.

Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.

Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.

""Please mail these out separately‚Äî15 days from today.""

Chapter 2

After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.

The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...

All of it‚Äîevery memory tied to them‚Äîwas now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.

In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.

She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.

After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home‚Äîonly to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.

One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.

Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.

The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?

The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.

Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.

""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""

She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.

""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""

Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""

""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""

Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing‚Äîyet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.

She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""

Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.

""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""

Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.

The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.

The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.

""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""

""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""

""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""

Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.

""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""

Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.

Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.

She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.

Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.

Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""

Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.

""Leave the coffee and get out.""

Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.

Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.

The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.

Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.

Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.

Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.

Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.

Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.

Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.

They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.

Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.

Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.

Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.

Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.

Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.

Chapter 3

After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window‚Äîonly to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.

Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.

""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""

""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""

Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.

So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.

They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.

Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.

She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.

They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.

Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave‚Äîonly for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.

The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.

""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""

""How much did you hear just now?""

""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""

They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.

Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""

Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.

After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.

""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""

Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""

""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""

As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.

Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.

""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""

Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.

Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.

""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""

Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.

""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""

Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""

Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.

""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""

The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.

Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.

""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""

Chapter 4

After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.

The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.

Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.

Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.

A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.

""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""

Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.

""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""

""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... ""

""There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""

The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.

The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.

She had seen everything‚Äîthe panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.

In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.

However, after everything that happened, she finally understood‚Äîthey loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.

Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.

So, no, she could never compete with Janet.

Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.

Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.

""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""

Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.

""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""

After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.

She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.

I‚Äôve been trying to manifest my ex back, more or less consistently, for the past 3 months since our breakup.

Yesterday, I was in a good mood, and for the past two days I‚Äôd been watching videos of vintage engagement rings with big diamonds because I find them stunning. I started imagining one of those rings on my finger, one that my ex would give me.

Later in the day, I went to my grandmother‚Äôs for coffee, and I had another wave of excitement while picturing myself wearing a vintage ring from my ex.

Two hours later, she started talking about what she would leave each of her grandchildren when she passed away (we are five in total), and for me, she pulled out a vintage ring, the only one she wears , and told me she had decided this ring would be for me. She even let me try it on, and I put it on the finger meant for an engagement ring.

What‚Äôs crazy is that two days earlier, I had looked at that exact ring on her hand and thought to myself: I like her ring

Then, later that same day, I randomly saw a street sign with my ex‚Äôs name on it , even though I basically never see that name anywhere.

Also, that same morning, I had tried the O method in the shower (since water is supposed to be a conductor), and I visualized my ex telling me that he missed me and wanted to get back together.

What do you think?

1ls89t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ls89t3/have_you_upgraded_your_alarm_system_recently/,Have you upgraded your alarm system recently?,"
That was the sales pitch. I had been unloading some boxes when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door there was a 20 something year old standing there with a blue collared shirt that read ‚ÄúPristine Alarms‚Äù. 

‚ÄúHello Sir, have you upgraded your alarm system recently?‚Äù

With a friendly smile I said. ‚ÄúWe actually don‚Äôt currently have one installed, we just moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúTalk about perfect timing! My name is Matt and I work for Pristine Alarms we specialize in home security. We have doorbell cameras, interior cameras, exterior cameras, automatic locks, and alarm systems. Everything to keep you and your family safe!‚Äù

‚ÄúI appreciate the offer Matt but we have so much going on right now I don‚Äôt have the brain capacity to think about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI completely understand, feel free to think about it and contact me if you have any questions. I will leave you my card with my personal number on it and if you‚Äôre interested just give me a call and we can set you up!‚Äù

And with that he was gone. I wasn‚Äôt lying I had been doing a million things since we moved in a few days ago. I had just taken a promotion which unfortunately required a relocation. The kids weren‚Äôt too happy but they were still young so had plenty of time to make some new friends and start over. My wife has been great about this whole thing. She supported the move even though we knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be easy and was going to be a pain to start over. Later that night during our latest round of fast food I mentioned the alarm system pitch I was offered and asked her thoughts on it. 

‚ÄúI mean, I think this is a pretty safe neighborhood but I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting one. It will give us peace of mind for when we aren‚Äôt home or when we‚Äôre sleeping.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre not wrong honey. It would put us at ease. I will call the guy tomorrow and see when we can set it up.‚Äù

Early the next morning I gave Matt a call. I figured even if he didn‚Äôt answer I could leave a message and he would get back to me. To my surprise he answered after the first ring.

‚ÄúHello, this is Matt with Pristine Alarms. How can I help you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Matt, this is Phil Wheeler. You stopped by yesterday, I‚Äôm over on Harmony-‚Äú

‚ÄúAvenue! Yes of course I remember, just moved in right? How can I help you Phil?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell after talking it over with my other half we decided we need an Alarm system. We feel safe but a little added security won‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent! Because you just moved in, I would love to offer you a discount!‚Äù 

‚ÄúReally? That would be amazing. What are we thinking?‚Äù

‚Äú2 interior cameras for main living area and hallway, 2 exterior cameras for front and back sides of the house, 2 automatic locks for the front and back door, doorbell camera and keypad! How does $500 for all that sound?!‚Äù

‚Äú500, oh that‚Äôs a little steep. On top of a monthly service that‚Äôs a little too much for us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wave the monthly fee! Just the initial cost and no monthly expenses. We want to make sure you choose us!‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, DEAL! I really appreciate this Matt. When can we set up this installation? I just have to make sure someone is-‚Äú

‚ÄúHow does right now sound?! I just had a cancellation and I‚Äôm not too far away. I can come by right now and start the install. I should have all the items I promised in the work Van.‚Äù

‚ÄúUhh yeah that would be amazing, this is my last day off before I start my job so this works out perfect.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome, I‚Äôll see you soon Phil.‚Äù

Within 5 minutes I saw a van pull up to my house. I thought to myself ‚ÄúDamn, that was fast.‚Äù But didn‚Äôt think much of it. I opened the front door and there was Matt in his blue polo. He gave me a wave and continued on to the back of the van. I didn‚Äôt notice anyone else in the van. Was another one coming. Is he going to do this entire install by himself? Sure enough Matt exited the back of the van with a ladder, tool belt and camera in hand. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start on the front and back cameras then I can move on to the interior. If you have any errands to run feel free, this is going to take me a while.‚Äù

While I wasn‚Äôt too keen on the idea of leaving the house I did have some things to do. The kids were at school and my wife was at work. She was a manager at a department store and was able to make a lateral transfer to a store near our new home. I had to go to the post office and pick up some paint for my home office. I decided to take care of my plans and figured I‚Äôd be back within the hour. 

As I pulled back up to the house I saw Matt putting the ladder away. While I closed the car door Matt approached me. 

‚ÄúAlright Phil the exterior is done, I was able to to install the doorbell camera as well. I‚Äôm ready to move on to the interior when you are!‚Äù He said excitedly

‚ÄúGreat, follow me and let me know if you need anything.‚Äù

I entered the house and Matt quickly followed behind. I headed towards the office while Matt started to set up the cameras and keypad. I wanted to get a head start on painting the office because I knew I started work the next day. 

About and hour and a half later, I had just finished applying the first coat when Matt called out to me. 

‚ÄúHey Phil! All done! Just have to install the app on your phone and you will be able to access the cameras, keypad, and locks directly from your phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome, thanks again! Is there some place I can leave you a review or call your boss or anything? You‚Äôve been great and I‚Äôd love to rave about you.‚Äù I said as I chuckled.

Matt turned to me suddenly. ‚ÄúNo. Uh no it‚Äôs alright just doing my job.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay? Uhh anyway what‚Äôs the app?‚Äù

‚ÄúMay I?‚Äù Matt reached out his open hand.

I handed him the phone without thinking. I had a big day ahead and just wanted to be finished. Within 30 seconds Matt had downloaded the app and handed my phone back to me.

‚ÄúAll set! I put the app on your Home Screen! Click the big blue ‚ÄúP.A‚Äù and it will bring you to your door bell camera. You can cycle through each camera by clicking the camera icon. Your door can be unlocked with a push of the lock icon, and your keypad can be used by, you guessed it, clicking the keypad icon. I set your default code to your house number. To set it just hit ‚Äúset‚Äù and then the code. To turn it off hit ‚Äúoff‚Äù and then the code. Pretty simple! Feel free to change it at anytime!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is great, thanks again Matt.‚Äù I said as we walked towards the door. ‚Äú I‚Äôll be sure to spread the word to all the neighbors!‚Äù

Matt stopped walking.

‚ÄúNo no, no need too I already dealt with most of the neighborhood so please don‚Äôt mention me.‚Äù

What a weirdo I thought to myself. ‚ÄúNo problem, thanks again!‚Äù 

As Matt left I walked back to my office to put on the second coat of paint.

When my wife and kids got home, I showed them the new cameras and alarm system. The kids couldn‚Äôt care less but my wife was impressed with not only the price but the fast installation.

‚ÄúSo this guy Matt did all this today by himself? Damn thats pretty impressive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. The app is great, I can unlock the door from anywhere and can check on the cameras when we aren‚Äôt home. You should download it too babe.‚Äù 

We looked it up on her phone but for some reason couldn‚Äôt find it. We searched up Pristine Alarms, P.A, even searched Alarm apps but couldn‚Äôt find anything. I told her I‚Äôd give Matt a call in the morning and get it figured out. 

I went to bed that night excited to start my new job but surprisingly I was able to fall asleep pretty fast. Unfortunately my rest only lasted for a few hours. We were woken up by the sound of a blaring siren. For a split second I had no idea what was happening. I jumped up from bed and ran straight to the door. ‚ÄúDid someone try to come in?‚Äù My wife said as I looked through the window. I saw nothing. I checked the back door and windows. Once again, nothing. Once I got my bearings I headed for the keypad. I hit the ‚Äúoff‚Äù button and put our house number in. The words ‚Äúaccess denied‚Äù popped up on the screen. I tried again, same message. By this point my family was behind me and starting to get annoyed.

‚ÄúWhats going on?‚Äù My wife said.

‚ÄúI have no idea, it wont turn off, it keeps saying access denied.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHear let me try.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHit the off button and then put our house number in.‚Äù

She did just that. The sirens stopped. I stood there confused. Did I enter it wrong? I mean I‚Äôm out of it, sure but I know I entered it in correctly. 

After our hearts stopped racing we all headed back to bed. On the way to work I was going to call Matt and figure out the alarm situation. 

I got ready and downed a cup of coffee. I was EXHAUSTED. I called him on the way to the office. One ring and then an answer.

‚ÄúHey Phil, I recognized your number. What can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Matt. We are having some trouble with the alarm. It went off randomly last night and when I entered the code it didn‚Äôt turn off.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, thats strange. I can come by and check it out. Maybe run a couple of tests.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, what is a good time for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you said you had work today? Is anyone home right now? I have some time before my first job‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah my wife, I will call her and let her know you will be stopping by to fix the issue, i appreciate it.‚Äù

I called home and let my wife know Matt will be coming by. She was a little annoyed that she had to put on real clothes instead of pajamas but understood it needed to be done.

5 minutes later I got a notification on my phone that someone was at the front door. I opened the alarm app and saw the doorbell camera. It was Matt. That was fast. My wife opened the door and let Matt inside. I closed the app and headed into the office. 

On my lunch break I decided to call home. 

‚ÄúHey honey, hows your first day?‚Äù My wife asked.

‚ÄúIt is good darling, hows your day off? Did Matt fix the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is actually still here he said there was some sort of software issue.‚Äù

It had already been a few hours. He installed everything in less than 3. How does a software issue take more time. I told my wife I‚Äôd call her back. I wanted to know what was taking so long. I called Matt. No answer.

I called again. No answer.

What the hell is going on. The guy answers on the first ring every time I call. Now no answer at all. I decided to check the cameras. The front camera showed his van was still there. I cycled through the cameras. My wife was sitting on the couch watching t.v. I switch to the hallway camera. No sign of Matt. I was just about to switch to the back camera when I saw him. He was exiting our bedroom. I immediately called my wife.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is he doing in our room?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about he is by the keypad.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo he is not I just saw him walking out of our room!‚Äù

Thats when I got another call. It was Matt. I told my wife he was calling and I had to go.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you think you‚Äôre doing walking around my house?‚Äù

‚ÄúPhil I don‚Äôt appreciate you talking to me that way. For your information I was installing window sensors. I felt it was the least I can do for the inconvenience of the alarm going off last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, uhh sorry, it just looked, well it just looked weird. You coming out of the bedroom like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you watching me Phil? Haha good to know the cameras work well. Don‚Äôt be concerned, the alarm is working perfectly now and your wife was great company. I‚Äôll head out now. Enjoy your day Phil.‚Äù

‚ÄúUhh, thanks Matt sorry for blowing up like that.‚Äù

He had already hung up. 

After work I headed straight home, when the kids went to sleep I spoke to my wife about the window sensors. I told her he installed them free of charge. She was thankful but thought it was strange he didn‚Äôt mention it to her.

The next few days went smooth. Work was starting great, the family was settling in day by day and there weren‚Äôt any more issues with the alarm system. 

Until my wife and I decided to have a date night. 

We wanted to treat ourselves. The move was overwhelming and it was time for us to enjoy ourselves. We were just going out to dinner. The kids were old enough to be by themselves for a few hours plus we would be able to have eyes on them and the house with the cameras. 

We got all fancied up. We headed to a well reviewed steakhouse and were just enjoying each others company. That‚Äôs when I got a notification on my phone. ‚ÄúFront door unlocked.‚Äù
I looked at my wife puzzled and showed her my phone. She called the kids right away and I checked the doorbell camera. No one there. I was going through the other cameras and saw nothing. Then another notification. ‚ÄúBack door unlocked.‚Äù My wife was on the phone.

‚ÄúDid you unlock the door?‚Äù She put it on speaker.

‚ÄúNo? We are doing homework and watching tv.‚Äù

‚ÄúCheck the doors make sure they are locked‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. I locked them. Is everything okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes everything is fine we just got a notification that the doors had been unlocked.‚Äù

She looked at me.

I said ‚ÄúMaybe the system is messing up again.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe but I feel weird now, we should go.‚Äù

Just as I asked for the check. Another notification comes through. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs motion at the front door.‚Äù I check. No one there. I begin to check the cameras once again. Thats when I see the van. Matt‚Äôs van. What the hell?

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs motion at the back door.‚Äù

I cycle through. There is Matt standing by my back door.

‚ÄúBack door unlocked.‚Äù

What the fuck.

I tell my wife we need to go now. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs motion at the front door.‚Äù

‚ÄúFront door unlocked‚Äù

I call Matt. 

‚ÄúHello Phil‚Äù

‚ÄúMatt what the fuck are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-‚Äú

‚ÄúCalm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I‚Äôm gonna take off now.‚Äù

I looked at my wife ‚ÄùCall the cops, now!‚Äù

I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched ‚ÄúPristine Alarms‚Äù nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn‚Äôt much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

My wife and the kids stayed ‚Äúhome‚Äù the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn‚Äôt until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn‚Äôt have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

I ran to enter the code.

‚ÄúAccess denied‚Äù

I tried again.

‚ÄúAccess denied‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs motion at the back door‚Äù

The siren stopped.

My phone rang.

‚ÄúHi there Phil, I see you‚Äôre home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say a word.

‚ÄúPhil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I‚Äôm just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you, ‚ÄúPristine Alarms‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a real fucking company.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon now Philly, I work hard at my job.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just wanna make sure you‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

He hung up.

‚ÄúFront door unlocked.‚Äù

I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That‚Äôs when the back door swung open. 

By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT FUCKING MOVE!‚Äù The police must‚Äôve been called by one of the neighbors.

My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That‚Äôs when I noticed the all too familiar ‚ÄúPristine Alarms‚Äù van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.
Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

My phone rang.

I answered.

‚ÄúLooks like everything is in working order, please call me if you need any more help Phil.‚Äù

* Mornings are frequently a race against time in today‚Äôs fast-paced world, particularly for working professionals balancing rigorous schedules, domestic duties, and everyday stressors.
* Personal care, especially hair care, often suffers in the midst of this chaos. However, the way you treat your hair in the morning can have a big impact on how healthy, manageable, and attractive it is all day.
* A quick, easy, and efficient regimen promotes self-care, consistency, and confidence in addition to beauty.

https://preview.redd.it/mvr2ybwrn1bf1.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff1ee246140222b44305a0dd92d2c107c7c94fb0

* We are specialists in natural care products and holistic beauty, therefore we are aware of the particular requirements of busy men and women.
* Professionals who deal with environmental stressors, irregular diets, and time constraints frequently have hair issues like frizz, dryness, dullness, and premature hair loss.
* For this reason, we have developed a 5-step, time-saving hair care regimen especially for people with hectic schedules who wish to achieve noticeable results without spending a lot of time in front of the mirror.
* This less than ten-minute routine uses natural, easy-to-use products that complement your hair type and daily requirements, and it doesn‚Äôt require heat styling tools.
* This advice will help you keep your hair nourished and styled whether you‚Äôre running errands in between deadlines or attending back-to-back meetings.
* Our suggestions are supported by consumer feedback, trichology insights, and reliable, everyday-use ingredient-based formulations. In order to provide a gender-neutral strategy that emphasises hair health, scalp care, and styling ease, we have considered both male and female hair care routines. Additional product recommendations, professional advice, and time-saving techniques are also provided to assist you in creating a stress-free morning routine that complements your personal and professional lives.
* This blog is for you if you‚Äôve ever said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for hair care in the morning.‚Äù
* Additionally, this 5-step regimen might become your new best friend if you‚Äôve been having trouble with hair that just doesn‚Äôt cooperate when you‚Äôre in a hurry to get out the door.

**1. 5-Minute Hair Care Routine for Working Professionals: Men & Women**

* The greatest luxury for working professionals is time.
* Even 15 minutes for grooming can seem unattainable with back-to-back meetings, daily commutes, and household duties.
* However, five minutes each morning can make a big difference in your overall appearance and the condition of your hair.
* Your hair doesn‚Äôt need an hour to seem polished and healthy.
* We have developed a rapid yet efficient hair care regimen that suits the needs of modern workers, whether they are corporate executives, field agents, teachers, or creative entrepreneurs.
* We are beauty and wellness experts who collaborate with dermatologists, trichologists, and actual users.
* All hair types can benefit from this time-saving, gender-neutral technique.
* The goal is to make your hair look its best with the least amount of work by emphasising protection, moisture, and minimal styling.

https://preview.redd.it/756g7a8bo1bf1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1991821250cee209866de0e57ef7bba2ef6d48e

* **Step 1: Give your scalp a light massage and apply a leave-in treatment for one minute.**
   * Instead of heavily oiling your hair in the morning, use a water-based hair serum or a mild leave-in treatment.
   * For approximately one minute, softly massage your scalp in circular strokes with your fingertips. This promotes uniform product distribution, eases tension, and increases blood circulation.
* **Expert Tip:**
   * For nourishment without the mess, use natural, non-sticky solutions like rosemary scalp gel or hibiscus hair gel.
* **Step 2: Hydrate and Spray (one minute)**
   * Overnight, especially if you sleep in an air-conditioned room, hair tends to lose moisture. To revitalise your hair, use an aloe vera-based hair spray or hydrating mist. You can add shine, control frizz, and maintain the freshness of your hair all day with a few spritzes.
   * Reliable Advice: For extra hair strengthening, look for products that are alcohol-free and high in botanical extracts, such as onion juice or rose water.
* **Step 3: Untangle Without Corrupting Anything (1 Minute)**
   * Gently comb your hair from the ends to the roots with a detangling brush or a wide-tooth comb.
   * This keeps your hair from breaking and guarantees that the moisturising spray or leave-in is evenly distributed throughout your hair.
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Because wet hair is more likely to break, detangle your hair when it‚Äôs just a little damp but not soggy.
* **Step 4: One Minute of Fast Styling**
* **For females:**
   * A sleek half-updo, fast braid, or low bun is fashionable and appropriate for the office.
   * For males: For a polished appearance, use a finger comb and natural hair gel or cream.
   * The objective is neatness and little work, not perfection.
* **Style Tip:**
   * Apply natural-looking styling products that are light and non-crunchy.
* **Step 5: Sun Protection + Frizz Guard (1 Minute)**
   * To seal in hydration and avoid split ends, apply a final touch of hair butter cream or anti-frizz serum to the ends.
   * Use a UV-protective hair mist before you go outside; this is especially crucial for coloured or treated hair.
* **Reliable Formulation:**
   * Seek out natural active ingredients that offer protection against environmental stressors, such as flaxseed, argan oil, or black seed oil.

**2. Top 5 Quick Hair Fixes Every Working Man and Woman Should Try Before 9 AM**

* Your hair isn‚Äôt cooperating, and you‚Äôre running late for work? You‚Äôre not by yourself.
* The majority of professionals deal with hair problems in the morning, whether they be frizz, flatness, greasiness, or unexpected flyaways.
* Thankfully, you can appear put together without going to the salon or doing a full wash and style.
* Before you leave for work, you can quickly revitalise your appearance and confidence with a few focused, time-saving hairstyles.
* We have collaborated with actual professionals, haircare specialists, and product producers to compile the top 5 easy hairstyles that take no more than two minutes each and don‚Äôt need the use of heat tools.
* We are a reliable source for hair wellness and beauty regimens.

https://preview.redd.it/zk89vz3eo1bf1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d3e52b657371cdda3fb6b52109f0b7c65df9fbd

* **The Rescue of Dry Shampoo (Duration: 1 minute)**
* **Issue:**¬†No time to wash, flat hair, and oily roots.
   * Fix: You can quickly remove extra oil from your hair, give it lift at the roots, and leave it smelling great with a few sprays of a natural dry shampoo (or make your own at home with rice flour and a little cocoa for darker hair).
* **Reliable Tip:**
   * If you‚Äôre in a big hurry the following morning, apply at night; it will absorb overnight and work even better.
* **Use Aloe-Based Gel to Reduce Frizz (Time: 2 Minutes)**
* **Issue:**¬†Humidity or nighttime dryness causing frizz and puffiness.
   * Fix: To smooth frizz and flyaways, dab on a tiny bit of a lightweight, non-sticky hair gel made of hibiscus or aloe vera. This is great for knotted styles, buns, or open hair.
* **Expert Pick:**¬†For healthy hair and no buildup, choose for alcohol-free gels enhanced with flaxseed, onion extract, or rose water.
* **The Sleek Comb-Through for Men and the Quick Bun or Twist for Women (Duration: 1‚Äì2 Minutes)**
* **Issue:**¬†Untidy hair or insufficient time for styling.
* **Correct:**¬†For ladies, choose a braid with serum-finished ends, a quick twist with a clutch, or a messy low bun. For guys, comb your hair into place after using a style balm or natural hair care and running your fingers over it.
* **Trust Insight:**¬†For styling and care, try products containing shea butter, coconut milk, or rosemary extract instead of chemical gels.
* **Flip & Massage the Scalp for Immediate Volume (30 seconds)**
* **Issue:**¬†dull appearance, flat hair, and no volume.
* Fix: Turn your hair upside down, massage your scalp for 20 seconds with your fingertips. You‚Äôll notice a natural lift as you flip back.
* **Bonus:**¬†To increase circulation and create a natural glow, dab on a drop of light oil or serum during this time.

**3. Morning Hair Routine for Office-Goers: Easy, Fast & Effective Steps**

* Mornings for office workers frequently feel like a race against the clock.
* There‚Äôs barely time for self-care, particularly hair care, between making breakfast, reading emails, and getting ready. However, maintaining a salon-level routine is not necessary to look put together and presentable.
* You may maintain a simple, quick, and efficient morning hair care regimen that works well with your busy schedule if you take the appropriate approach.
* After consulting with natural hair care specialists, working women, and professional stylists, we created an easy-to-follow strategy that will give you long-lasting benefits throughout your workday in less than ten minutes.
* All hair types, including curly, straight, and textured hair, can benefit from this easy, gender-neutral treatment.

https://preview.redd.it/fbvq1xtgo1bf1.png?width=169&format=png&auto=webp&s=9858cc3f654ab0d584dad8415c7ddff326e757e8

* **Step 1: Get Up and Refresh for One Minute**
   * Your hair needs a quick refresh as soon as you get out of bed. Overnight dehydration can cause frizz, static, or a limp texture in the hair.
* **Take action:**¬†Use plain water, aloe vera mist, or rose water to lightly mist your hair. This reactivates any product left over from the previous evening and moisturises the strands.
* **Trust Tip:**¬†Steer clear of harsh alcohol-based sprays that cause the scalp to become parched. Choose herbal mists or hydrosols.
* **Step 2: Give Your Scalp Some Nutrition (2 Minutes)**
   * Hair health is correlated with scalp health. However, morning oiling? Not realistic.
* **Action:**¬†Apply a non-sticky hair tonic, such as hibiscus or rosemary gel, directly to the scalp. Use your fingertips to gently massage for approximately one minute. This increases root strength, decreases dry scalp, and promotes circulation.
* **Expert Pick:**¬†Because they absorb rapidly and don‚Äôt leave any residue, water-based gels containing active botanicals are great for professionals with hectic schedules.
* **Step 3: Detangle and Smooth (2 Minutes)**
   * Frizz that doesn‚Äôt appear professional and breakage are two consequences of tangled hair.
   * Take action by using a detangling brush or wide-tooth comb. To prevent damage, begin at the tips and work your way up to the roots.
* **Optional:**¬†To add slide and softness, brush in a pea-sized amount of lightweight serum or leave-in conditioner.
* **Verified Advice:**¬†Finger combing with a small amount of flaxseed or argan serum works well and gently for thick or curly hair.
* **Step 4:**¬†Create a Style That Holds for Two to Three Minutes
   * Smart styling, not complex settings, is the focus of this step.
* **For women:**¬†A nicely cut back section, twisted ponytail, or quick low bun creates a polished, tidy appearance.
* **For men:**¬†Use a natural styling gel to comb your hair into place or apply a soft-hold balm to your fingers.
* **Style Tip:**¬†To avoid breaking, use fabric bands or scrunchies rather than tight rubber bands.
* **Step 5: Secure Protection & Shine for One Minute**
   * To seal in moisture and give a hint of shine, apply a light oil or serum to the ends of your hair. Use a UV-blocking spray if you‚Äôre going outside.

**4. No-Fuss Morning Hair Routine for Busy Schedules (Men & Women)**

* Mornings are sometimes a haze in today‚Äôs hectic world, particularly for working men and women juggling meetings, deadlines, commutes, and personal obligations.
* Extensive hair care regimens become impractical when time is limited. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to forgo maintaining the health of your hair or your beauty.
* A quick, easy morning hair routine that produces results without the need for heat styling, numerous products, or a half-hour prep time is the answer.
* As hair care advisors and beauty formulators, we have worked with hundreds of professionals from a variety of professions, including field executives and corporate managers, and we have found that everyone needs a routine that is simple, efficient, and time-saving.
* This method is for you if you want to control frizz, restyle oily hair, or just seem put together and put together for the day.

https://preview.redd.it/1h9i814jo1bf1.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8acbcba2473f1010d028ad6501ca93ec26b6b37

* **Step 1: Refresh instead of shampoo (1‚Äì2 minutes)**
   * Daily hair washing might remove natural oils from your hair. To revitalise the scalp and absorb extra oil, try a DIY rice powder, hair mist, or natural dry shampoo instead.
* **Experience Advice:**¬†Just use dry shampoo to dust hair roots, wait 30 seconds, and then brush or towel them off. This instantly volumises hair and gives it a cleaner feel.
* **Suggested For:**¬†Unwashed hair days, flat roots, and oily scalps.
* **Step 2: One-minute instant moisture shot**
   * Those who sleep under fans or in air conditioning often wake up with dry, scratchy hair.
   * Fix: To soften and rehydrate hair, use a rose water mist, aloe vera spray, or moisturising leave-in conditioner.
* **Reliable Guidance:**¬†Choose heavier textures, such as leave-in butter or curl cream, for thick or curly hair. To prevent weighing down fine hair, apply a watery mist.
* **Step 3: Simple Styling That Lasts (two to three minutes)**
   * Ignore intricate styles. Here are some easy choices that look good and last all day:
* **For women:**¬†claw-clip twist, sloppy bun with serum finish, or low ponytail with side part.
* **For men:**¬†a simple slick-back with hair cream, a textured crop with natural gel, or a finger-combed side sweep.
* **Expert Product Tip:**¬†Select styling products that contain shea butter, hibiscus, or flaxseed; they provide nourishment, hold, and shine without leaving any residue.
* Step 4: Add Shine and Tame Flyaways (1 Minute)
* Apply a few drops of a light serum or non-sticky oil (such as argan or black seed) to the crown and ends of your hair. This keeps moisture in, adds shine, and manages frizz.
* Fast Fix Even baby hairs around the hairline can be flattened with a dab of aloe gel.
* **Bonus Step:**¬†30-second optional scalp stimulator
* Use your fingertips or a roller to gently massage your scalp if you have an additional 30 seconds. This promotes long-term hair development and improves blood flow, which is particularly helpful if you have stress-related hair problems.

**5. 5 Effortless Hair Care Habits for Working Professionals in a Rush**

* Wake early, get ready, maybe grab breakfast, and head out the door quickly. For most working professionals, mornings are all about speed. Regretfully, hair care is the first thing to suffer in this rush.
* But what if it didn‚Äôt take more time or effort to keep hair looking fantastic and healthy? No matter how busy your calendar is, the secret is to develop simple, easy habits that flow effortlessly into your daily routine.
* As hair care consultants and beauty specialists who collaborate closely with trichologists, dermatologists, and other true professionals, we have discovered five easy daily routines that have a lasting effect on hair health.
* These don‚Äôt require a whole routine overhaul or additional supplies. Rather, they are clever adjustments that function in the background as you go about your hectic day.

https://preview.redd.it/4lj92lupo1bf1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ccf05badb37c9da218841b1119e7f79dfea330

* **Use a satin pillowcase to sleep Pillowcase**
* Why it functions: The majority of us are unaware that sleep damages our hair. Tangles, frizz, and breakage are caused by friction against cotton pillowcases
* **Simple Solution:**¬†Use a silk or satin pillowcase instead. This easy adjustment makes your hair smoother in the morning, helps it retain moisture, and lessens breakage.
* **Professional Perspective:**¬†Without you having to do anything extra, a good night‚Äôs sleep on the correct fabric promotes the health of your skin and scalp.
* **Before brushing, apply a leave-in product.**
* **Why it functions:**¬†Split ends and mechanical damage can result from combing dry, tangled hair.
* **Easy Fix:**¬†Keep a detangler, aloe vera mist, or leave-in serum close to your brush or comb. A tiny quantity protects your hair when brushing and makes it easier to manage.
* **Pro Tip:**¬†For optimal results, begin detangling from the ends upward with a wide-tooth comb.
* **Treat Your Hair the Same Way You Treat Your Skin**
* **Why it works:**¬†Your hair requires regular hydration, just like your skin, particularly if you spend time in the sun or in air-conditioned spaces.
* **Easy Fix:**¬†Keep a rose water spritz or moisturising hair mist in your luggage or on your desk. A short spritz in the middle of the day offers a new aroma and restores suppleness.
* **Reliable Option:**¬†Mists containing panthenol or aloe vera are safe for all hair types and lightweight.
* **Use Your Hands, Not Heat, to Style**
* **Why it functions:**¬†When used frequently, heat styling appliances like blow dryers and straighteners can harm hair over time.
* **Easy Fix:**¬†Apply a natural-hold gel or cream to your hair and style it with your fingers or a gentle brush on most days. This keeps you looking professional while saving time and preventing heat damage.
* **Expert Advice:**¬†Look for styling tools that have nutrients like hibiscus extract, black seed oil, or flaxseed gel that nourish while they hold.
* **Using a massage while multitasking**
* **Why it functions:**¬†Many people neglect oiling because of time constraints, despite the fact that a healthy scalp is necessary for good hair development.
* **Easy Fix:**¬†While reading emails, waiting for coffee, or taking a shower, spend a minute massaging your scalp. This promotes healthier hair by increasing circulation and lowering tension, even in the absence of oil.
* **Reliable Advice:**¬†Water-based scalp gels that absorb rapidly and don‚Äôt leave any residue are another option.",1,1751716578.0,relaxedhair,0,1.0,False
1ls86jo,https://i.redd.it/qtludmbmo1bf1.png,My Bestie Sacrifices Her V-Card to 'Heal' My Husband While I Hit My Peak with Her Man,"Chapter 1



I caught my husband cheating ‚Äì right in my best friend's bed.



There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn‚Äôt get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.



I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.



Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.



Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]



""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""



I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.



The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.



My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.



My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake ‚Äì she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.



""Rita... we can...""



""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.



""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""



Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.



""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""



I stepped back.



""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS ‚Äì since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""



Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""



I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""



""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""



Gina's face went ghost white.



She was Milo's brother‚Äòs wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.



Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.



""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.



I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""



Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.



""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""



Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.



""Gina, get up first.""



I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""



She looked up at me hopefully.



I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you‚Äôre gonna break my husband‚Äôs heart.""



Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.



""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""



I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.



What a shameless thing to say.



""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""



Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""



""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.



""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting ‚Äì they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""



Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.



I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""



""You‚Äî!"" Gina was shaking with rage.



Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.



I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""



""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""



Oliver's deep voice filled the room.



Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.



Chapter 2



Footsteps echoed from the hallway.



I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.



Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.



His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.



""Bro...""



Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.



Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""



I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""



Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.



""Honey, this isn't what you think...""



""Shut up.""



Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.



I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.



I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.



But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.



""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.



Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.



This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.



Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.



Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.



After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.



My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.



After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""



No one answered.



""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.



Even I jumped.



Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""



Three years.



Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.



So he'd been lying to me from day one.



All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" ‚Äì pure lies.



I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:



""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""



Milo kept his head down.



""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.



Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""



""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.



""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""



Milo went pale as a ghost.



Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""



I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""



If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.



I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go ‚Äì this place is disgusting.""



Oliver nodded and turned to leave.



""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.



I turned back with the sweetest smile:



""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""



""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly ‚Äì we're doing you a favor.""



""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.



Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.



Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.



""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""



Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‚Äòpoor beauty‚Äô.



But Oliver didn't even glance her way.



""No way.""



Chapter 3



""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""



Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.



I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.



This plot development is so melodramatic.



""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage ‚Äì do you have any fucking shame left!""



Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.



My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""



I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""



When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.



""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""



I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.



The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""



Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""



""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.



""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""



Gina's mom's face turned bright red.



""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""



I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""



She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""



I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""



""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison ‚Äì that's your older son-in-law.""



""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison ‚Äì that's your younger son-in-law.""



""So I'm genuinely curious ‚Äì which son-in-law are you referring to?""



All my colleagues gasped.



Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""



I pulled out my phone.



""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""



She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""



I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""



""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""



She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""



I laughed: ""What is it ‚Äì can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""



Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.



My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.



Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""



I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""



Back in my office, I texted Oliver:



\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]



Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]

Is FIRE by 50 realistic for me ?,"Firstly this isn't a 'i have 15 billion can I maybe retire if I earn another ten billion a year for the next fifty years ?' post but I realise fire may be out of reach for me before a potentially very comfortable retirement. I am grateful for my position and not looking for humble brag reassurance or anything like that, just some ideas about different options going forward. I am aware that if I can't retire early but I do make retirement if I continue like this it would be very decent. 

I'm 30, my networth is as follows:

- House worth about 435k (280k mortgage) shared with partner

- 20k VAFTGAG stocks and shares ISA (trying to add 500-750 a month) 

- 30K cash (premium bond emergency fund and a 5.75% interest account). High cash as have been spending a bit doing up the house. 

- defined benefit pension which will reach a value of 10k per year guaranteed value at the end of this year (I've calculated it's worth as about 200k based off 20 years x 10k as it's guaranteed from retirement age and linked to RPI). I'm adding  over 1500 a year value to it as things stand. 

Therefore whilst technically I'm over 250k networth it's predominantly stuck in a pension that I can't access til my late 60s, or if I do access it I'll take severe (but understandable) penalities and get a lot lower value. 

I earn about 65k, I could and have turned down jobs earning more but I just really love my job and it's a job I would have dreamt of when I graduated so I'm really keen not to chase money as some better paying jobs I've done I've hated so I kept changing until I found what I loved. I have the potential to earn more but I'm not great at doing something I see no joy in so I won't rush for a higher pay for the sake of it. 

My outings are about 2k a month but would drop to 1000/ 1200 max when the mortgage is gone.
I assumed by chucking about 750 a month away into VAFTGAG I'd be flying by 40 but even doing the maths I'll end up with maybe about 300-400k in my 50s. Obviously fantastic with my pension but hardly getting me out at 45 like I'd dreamed and much more late 50s/early 60s.

Needing some hard truths here - if I'm to fire by mid 50s I guess I need a job without the generous defined benefit pension but more cash or a few promotions?  Lets assume my partner's income doesn't impact me other than paying half the mortgage and bills and zero inheritance.

Harsh truths welcome because as much as I like my job I like sitting in the garden with a coffee and nowhere to be even more !

1ls7yxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusconsumer/comments/1ls7yxo/asus_chromebook_cm14_review_after_one_year_of_use/,ASUS Chromebook CM14 Review: After One Year of Use,"Finding an affordable laptop that balances performance, durability, and everyday usability is no easy task. When I got my hands on the ASUS Chromebook CM14, I was curious to see if it could handle my daily workflow without feeling sluggish. After spending some time with it, here‚Äôs my take on whether it‚Äôs worth your money.

**My Experience**

Right out of the box, the ASUS Chromebook CM14 feels lightweight yet sturdy. The Gravity Grey finish gives it a clean, modern look, and the 14-inch NanoEdge display provides a decent screen size for multitasking. It‚Äôs built for ChromeOS, which means it‚Äôs optimized for web-based tasks, and with its MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, I expected smooth performance for browsing, streaming, and basic productivity.

Here‚Äôs what stood out during my time using it:

**What I Liked**

**Surprisingly Smooth Performance ‚Äì** With an 8-core MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, this Chromebook handled everyday tasks well. I could browse with multiple tabs open, stream YouTube, and work on Google Docs without noticeable lag. However, it‚Äôs not built for heavy multitasking or demanding apps.

**Solid Build with Military-Grade Durability ‚Äì** ASUS really put effort into making this Chromebook durable. It meets US MIL-STD 810H standards, meaning it can withstand some serious wear and tear. Plus, the spill-resistant keyboard adds an extra layer of protection‚Äîperfect for those accidental coffee spills.

**Great Connectivity & Expandability ‚Äì** With Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, the wireless performance is strong and reliable. I also appreciated the USB-C ports with power delivery and display support, making it easy to connect to peripherals. The microSD slot is a bonus for expanding storage beyond the built-in 64GB eMMC.

**Privacy and Hygiene Features ‚Äì** The physical webcam shield is a nice touch for privacy-conscious users, and ASUS even added Antimicrobial Guard technology to inhibit bacteria growth on the keyboard. It‚Äôs not something you think about often, but it's a cool feature in today‚Äôs world.

**Where It Falls Short**

**Display is Just Okay** ‚Äì The 1366x768 HD resolution gets the job done, but it‚Äôs far from sharp. If you‚Äôre used to a 1080p display, you‚Äôll notice the difference, especially when streaming content. The anti-glare finish is helpful in bright environments, though.

**Limited Power for Demanding Tasks** ‚Äì The 4GB RAM is fine for light use, but if you tend to have 20+ Chrome tabs open or use Linux apps, you‚Äôll hit performance limits quickly. This is strictly an entry-level machine.

**Final Thoughts**

The ASUS Chromebook CM14 is a solid budget option for students, casual users, or anyone who needs a reliable, no-frills laptop for web-based tasks. It‚Äôs durable, well-connected, and privacy-focused, making it a great choice for on-the-go users. However, the lower-resolution display and modest RAM mean it‚Äôs not ideal for power users or those who need serious multitasking ability. If you need an affordable Chromebook that covers the basics with a few thoughtful extras, this one is worth considering.",1,1751715803.0,focusconsumer,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I‚Äôm the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person.

Occasionally I do just have 1 but those days have gotten farther apart. I am on day 6 of no drinking now. 

This weekend is gonna be tougher than the weekdays for sure! Been feeling bored and restless. Would love that quick and easy dopamine hit. My favorite was to have a cup of coffee in the afternoon  to get some things done and then rely on a few beers to settle me out. Now the coffee just amps me up to much and I don‚Äôt have the beer to relieve it. 

I have been lucky that I really don‚Äôt like the feeling of being drunk. I just LOVE the buzz. That‚Äôs my double edged sword, I can‚Äôt say there are many obvious areas in my life alcohol is negatively affecting. I just got married and we are going to be trying to get pregnant. It‚Äôs important to me and my spouse to do that sober even though I won‚Äôt be carrying the baby in my body. 

Is there anyone else out there that can relate to this? I don‚Äôt have an immensely destructive relationship with alcohol but I can see it is a drain in my life right now. I want to be able to be in a place where many days I don‚Äôt drink, and I don‚Äôt have to think about it. Or maybe have a beer with dinner but not two and it‚Äôs not something I have inner conflict over. I want to be clear headed and be a good role model for my future children. I want to show a balanced and healthy relationship with alcohol the way my dad taught me. It can be ok to drink but it should not have a hold on you. If it has a hold on you it isn‚Äôt ok to drink.

I‚Äôve always loved photography from 60 years ago when I started shooting black-and-white 35 mm film with no metering and simply the mantra ‚ÄúF8, 100th of a second on a sunny should be alright‚Äù. Since then, I‚Äôve had many cameras. The move to digital brought 2MP through the megapixel wars. Along the way I acquired digital SLR‚Äôs and various lenses, which I‚Äôve taken wonderful shots over time. Then along came the iPhone and I was not carrying the point-and-shoot anymore because for all intense and purposes the photos were pretty amazing. Add to that GPS and even with missing adjustable zoom, it was still not worth hauling along extra photo gear unless something serious was going to happen (by then I‚Äôd also acquired quite a lot of other gear-several tripods a couple more cameras, you get it)

Upon retirement about 10 years ago I started making solo rail trips to places I would never have imagined. I quickly realised that I‚Äôd like a camera that sat between the iPhone and a series serious SLR to take with me. It had to be light. By now I was very much in the Sony camp so this was when I acquired my first RX 100 - an M4. I took it off on a couple of trips with me and mixed its photos with iPhone photos. Collecting the albums together on my return it seemed hard to tell the difference unless I zoomed into pixels. Obviously the RX 100 did score when zooming in. At that stage, neither camera had any HDR facilities.

Over the next few years, my RX 100 was relegated to my box of camera gear and often left behind in favour of my bigger Sony A6400 and its lenses. By now, the iPhone had acquired automatic HDR and with its GPS was trivial to take a photo. Nevertheless, I‚Äôd haul my a 6400 on one of my trips. However, one time in a panic to catch a changed train, I left it on the seat. Distracted, I was forced to use my iPhone 12 for the rest of the holiday. Looking through the photos that I took, I was (sadly!) surprised at how good they were, HDR, realistic colours and now-a choice of at least three lenses. Made phone calls too.. Sadly, because I had always wanted, and still want to use a traditional camera. I kept looking at my camera gear refusing to admit that I had less and less justification to use it. The only justification would be if I had a camera that was easy to carry and had enough adjustments to relegate the iPhone back to a simple point and shoot device.

Enter the RX 100 M4 again, pulled out of my camera gear. By now, I saw the imminent arrival of the M7. The limited zoom of the M4 still held me back from hanging it around my neck so I decided to upgrade. I had an old a A000 so I bundled these together as a trade-in against the new M7. (It turned out they wouldn‚Äôt take the RX 100 because it had a tiny spot on the sensor at high F numbers which I‚Äôd never noticed, presumably a bit of pollen or something. Made me realise how the collapsible lens system was quite risky and dusty environments. My M4 was in mint condition-always kept in a Sony leather case - so somebody got a good bargain on eBay.

So, I‚Äôve just taken my new M7 on holiday and used it almost all the time for composed pictures. Nice zoom, lovely to get in to distance, and super adjustments that have allowed me to customise to my preferences. With the (horrible) imaging edge Sony software on my phone, GPS was now possible. Two things I hated. 1. the lack of in camera charging (I‚Äôm in the EU where USB-C is mandatory and Sony can‚Äôt be bothered) and 2. no HDR out of the camera (unless you‚Äôre prepared to do weird things with DRO, limit yourself to JPEG et cetera). I wanted to shoot in RAW and blow the iPhone away.

For a couple of years before this upgrade, I‚Äôve been taking old JPEGs shot a long time ago and passing them through Lightroom Mobile on my iPad. Quickly learning how to use this, I discovered that I could turn any old photo into an HDR version very quickly without complicated brushes, layers, et cetera. I‚Äôd always like the simplicity of the iOS photo album and I wanted to retain using it rather than to go the whole Adobe route. Lightroom then on the iPad was going to be my only tool I decided.

Fast forward to the photos coming of the M7, these were shot in RAW+JPEG. In the old days I would simply connect the camera to the file system and import all the files, half of which would then be RAW (DNG), the other half would be JPEG. The raw files I simply kept ‚Äúin case I needed them‚Äú which I never did. Now though I was hooked on HDR having been seduced by the output of the iPhone, so making a direct comparison between the RX 100 and iPhone impossible. The iPhone always won. Computational photography? Why couldn‚Äôt Sony have that built it into the RX 100?

So I had to find a way of quickly getting an RX 100 photo into being indistinguishable from the equivalent iPhone photo. Dispensing with all of the advice to pop HDR out of the RX 100 directly (which doesn‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre shooting raw) I started on the technique that I‚Äôd used in Lightroom mobile on my iPad to upgrade old JPEGs but now I would do it with direct raw out of the RX 100. The process had to be quick too, because life is too short to twiddle each single photo in fine detail. What I wanted was a workflow (I hate that word) that allowed me to pipeline photos out of the RX 100 into the iOS photo album have them converted into HDR and then let me simply pick the ones I liked much as I do when taking snaps on the iPhone.

This is how I did it.

1. You will need Lightroom mobile for iPad. So you‚Äôll need an iPad. You can almost certainly use the same method on Lightroom for Mac, but you‚Äôll have to try that yourself.

2. Set your RX 100 photo format to ‚ÄúRAW‚Äù

3. Take photos. Lots of them. If you like.

4. When you get home, plug the RX 100 into the iPad with your iOS photo album visible. After a few seconds you will see a new item under ‚Äúutilities‚Äù. It will probably be called something like ‚Äúunknown‚Äù or some other useless name.

5. Touch on this and it will open an ‚Äúimports‚Äú page. You will see sections segregated by date. You can select photos either individually or by these dates. Do so and click on ‚Äúimport selected‚Äú. If you‚Äôve taken quite a lot of raw photos, go and make a cup of coffee And then enjoyably watch them pouring into the iPad.

6. When this is all finished, unplug your camera because now you‚Äôre going to be working totally on the iPad and within Lightroom Mobile. Now go to either of ‚Äúhome‚Äù, ‚Äúimports‚Äù or to ‚Äúrecently saved‚Äú, anything that shows you the group of photos that you have just imported will do. Note that at this stage opening one of the photos will look very flat and boring compared to an equivalent iPhone photo. (It is possible to lift this horror towards niceness by using the iOS photo editor, but you really don‚Äôt want to do this. Pay for a Lightroom Mobile iOS subscription.)

7. Select all of the photos that you want this procedure to work on (by procedure I mean you‚Äôre going to convert these RAW photos to HDR). With them selected, use the share menu (up-arrow or breadcrumbs et cetera) and choose the option ‚Äúimport to Lightroom‚Äú. After the progress bar has finished, you can go into Lightroom and you will see all those photos as ‚Äúimports‚Äù open one of them, ideally the first.

8. In the Lightroom editor, go to the controls and press the HDR button. Nothing particularly special will happen but now you can drag the exposure slider a couple more stops to the right and the pictures start getting sexy. Twiddle through a few more knobs to make the picture nice. For example, you‚Äôll probably want to reduce the highlights and bring up the shadows.

9. When you‚Äôve got that photo looking fairly reasonable (it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect at this stage) use the top right menu and ‚Äúcopy settings‚Äù.

10. Go back to the Lightroom imports menu and select all of your imported photos. At the bottom of the Lightroom Mobile screen touch on ‚Äúpaste‚Äú. This will apply all of the adjustments that you made to that first photo to all of your other imports. Suddenly, all of your imported files are basically HDR with the same general settings that you used for this first photo. You may want to refine this procedure so that this pasting of one photo settings produces more what you would like on all photos such as exposure, shadows, et cetera.

11. Now you have a number of choices. You can select any of these photos and further edit it in Lightroom (which you might like to do because it‚Äôs easy to tweak things like the sky, more shadows et cetera) or you could simply ignore any further editing and export your result. Let‚Äôs look at simply exporting your result.

12. If you‚Äôve been editing one photo, you‚Äôll want the top right up arrow option. This gives you access to ‚Äúcopy to device‚Äú and ‚Äúexport as‚Äú. You‚Äôll want to set these up so that ‚Äúcopy to device‚Äù defaults to your choice, for example HDR JPEG. For each photo while you‚Äôve got it open you will want to export two things. Press ‚Äúcopy to device‚Äú which will save the HDR version as you see it and into your iOS photo album as if it were the iPhone photo. Finally, you will want to use that same menu to select ‚Äúexport as‚Äú. You should select the file format here to be ‚ÄúDNG‚Äú. What this means is that you will now have three versions of your photo. The original unmodified, an HDR output that you want (probably HDR JPEG) and another type of raw file (DNG), which is your original but combined with any edits that you‚Äôve made in Lightroom. The advantage of saving the latter is that you are not now reliant on any Adobe storage and you can open that DNG file in any Lightroom anywhere and it will preserve any editing that you did.

13. Instead of editing each file at a time and performing the above, you can do all the photos in one batch. Go back into the import screen and select all your photos. Use ‚Äúpaste settings‚Äù as described before, and then use the ‚Äúcopy to device‚Äú and, ‚Äúexport as‚Äú to repeat the generation of the two additional photo files again leaving you with three versions of your original capture.

14. Now you can go back into your iOS photo album and using the ‚Äúrecently saved‚Äú album, pick out the one in every three that is the HDR output. You‚Äôll see it quite clearly because it is brighter. Put these photos into the album that you want. You can ignore the others because you can find them again as follows.

15. If you ever want to edit that photo again, touch on ‚Äúshow in all photos‚Äú on the photo that you‚Äôre viewing. Adjacent to that photo in the complete photo stream will be the other two versions making up the three that relate to this photo. Simply choose the DNG version, use the ‚Äúimport to Lightroom‚Äú Option and you are there ready to continue editing. It may say ‚Äúcannot import duplicate‚Äú. This is because that photo is still there in Lightroom and you‚Äôll need to find it and continue editing with it. After editing, save the two as mentioned above and you‚Äôve now got a new HDR photo to look at. Ideally, find the old pair of DNG and old HDR JPEG that you don‚Äôt now need and delete them.

Seems complicated, but you quickly get the hang of it. In any case, there‚Äôs nothing to stop you making this even simpler by just choosing one of your photos, importing an into Lightroom, pressing ‚ÄúHDR‚Äù and working from there.

Hope this helps.

I'd like to buy a nice bottle to take over for this year's visit but I'm having a hard time narrowing down my search.

Does anyone have a recommendations for a Scottish single malt with an rare/interesting cask around (or less than) ‚Ç¨100? It doesn't have to be award winning or a collectable, just different enough that it wasn't only for marketing purposes.

1ls7o5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/homebirth/comments/1ls7o5w/how_a_home_birth_kept_us_safe_birth_story/,How a home birth kept us safe (birth story),"I‚Äôm 6 days postpartum with my son and thought I‚Äôd take a moment to share his arrival story as a continue to process it all. This is going to be long but hopefully someone finds it helpful and reassuring. 

My daughter (18mo) was born in a hospital via induction after a choleostasis diagnosis necessitated I transfer from the free standing birth center I was planning on birthing at. The typical cascade of interventions ensued as the multiple induction attempts, cervical checks, and general labor disruptions made my discomfort unmanageable and I elected for an epidural.

I was determined with my son to have the uninterrupted, physiological birth I had initially hoped for. My original reasons were still relevant ‚Äî better outcomes, easier recovery, personal preference, etc etc ‚Äî but I also just wanted to prove it to myself that I could. I decided to continue getting care at the birth center and planned to birth there (essentially a home birth, all the same support and equipment as a home team would have) since my toddler would be at home with my mom (my mothers presence would have 100% made my cervix close up).

8pm on the 29th my water breaks on the kitchen floor. 10pm contractions are mild but frequent. 2am we decide it‚Äôs time to head to the birth center. It was a warm, humid summer night and the car ride with my husband was actually lovely. I rest for a while at the birth center and lay in bed listening to an audiobook. Around 4am I feel compelled to get in the tub, but everything really ramps up around 5 and I am ALL over the place ‚Äî hands and knees on the floor, squatting on a birth stool, sitting on the toilet, standing over the bed, side laying with a peanut ball‚Ä¶. At this point I am absolutely roaring. It seemed like there was no reprieve between contractions but the freedom of moving my body and voice intuitively kept me grounded. 

Around 6/7am I didn‚Äôt think I could keep going. If I had been in a hospital I absolutely would have gotten an epidural, no hesitation, but the thought of getting into the car to transfer was incomprehensible to me so I just kept going. 

8/9am I started feeling the infamous pushing pressure I missed out on with my daughter. I was down on one knee with my husband holding me up from under the armpits, and a midwife was holding my belly up to help this kid descend. They could tell I was getting exhausted. My legs were starting to shake and I was loosing strength, so they became a little more active in trying to help move things along. Someone told me it was time to get in the tub and I have truly no idea how I managed to physically climb in there. 

I start pushing and deliver his head while on my knees, feeling everything with my hands. Then things start to go a little awry. My midwives started to be a little more hands on as signs of a potential shoulder dystocia appeared. I could tell that something ‚Äúoff‚Äù was happening but that it wasn‚Äôt time to panic. He was stuck. They calmly but firmly told me to get out of the tub (his head is out, mind you, so this means climbing out with his big ole head between my legs). Once on dry land I was directed to get into a sequence of poses while I pushed and they helped manipulate the rest of baby out. My husband joked afterwards that he hadn‚Äôt seen me move that fast since before I was pregnant. 

It was an utterly chaotic 2 minutes that felt like 2 hours, but they got him out‚Ä¶and he was completely lifeless, blue, and not breathing. Absolutely terrifying, but I am in absolute awe of how calm my team stayed. They were like a nascar pit crew. They talked me through everything they were doing ‚Äî said his heart rate was good, to just keep talking to him, to rub him and tell him to wake up ‚Äî as they performed resuscitation measures to get his lungs going. Baby started squeaking and then whimpering and then crying, and I watched his blood start to circulate and his skin pinked up. It looked like special effects in a movie.

At this point we are all still on the floor. Everyone tenderly gets us up and bundles us into bed. It‚Äôs 9:50am on June 30th ‚Äî sun is flooding into the windows, someone brings me coffee, and my husband joins us to snuggle. I sit there bewildered because what the fuck was that?? Did that really happen? I did it!!? 9lbs 2oz, and about 12 hours of active labor. Not a single tear. 

Here‚Äôs what I really can‚Äôt get over: if I had been in a different environment (a hospital) I have no doubts I would‚Äôve begged for an epidural around 6am. If I had done that, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to participate in getting my son unstuck. The squatting and lunging unscrewed him from my body fast enough to keep him safe (he needed O2, his cord pulse was slowing) and controlled enough to keep my body safe from invasive interventions that would have been necessary if I didn‚Äôt have mobility. We don‚Äôt know exactly why he was so stubborn, likely a combination of size and position, but had he descended like that in a hospital environment I very likely would have required an assisted delivery with a vacuum, forceps, and/or episiotomy ‚Äî Or maybe even a c section, depending on the on-call care team‚Äôs comfortability with complicated vaginal maneuvers. 

My initial thoughts after birthing him were ‚Äúwell wtf that was horrible, not doing that again‚Äù but now, almost a week later, I am finding so much peace and reassurance knowing that my inclination to birth this boy unmedicated and outside of a hospital ultimately kept us both safer in the face of a slight complication.

I‚Äôm a lesbian, and my parents are homophobic, so it meant a lot that she supported me personally as well as professionally, especially when I found out she‚Äôs queer too. We met on Zoom every 2 weeks for nearly 2 years. I was 22, and I really valued her kindness and thoughtfulness.

At the end of 2023, our formal mentorship ended. I appreciate all the time she volunteered for me. We exchanged gifts, said we‚Äôd stay in touch, and I even asked if we could meet in person. She lived 3 hours away and was open to it, but it never worked out, and I‚Äôve since moved too.

Since then, I‚Äôve sent occasional updates (which she seemed happy to get) and sometimes small career-related asks. Her replies eventually became shorter and less frequent (she started her own business), and recently she told me she wants to fully step down from the mentorship but is interested in hearing updates from me from time to time. That really hurt me as I thought we became friends, and the mentorship has already ended. I was waiting for things to naturally fade rather than forcing it and when I‚Äôm in a better place. But I thanked her and said she wouldn‚Äôt hear from me unless she reaches out. She said she still cares how things unfold in my life, and to remember she is always rooting for me whether or not we stay in touch, and she will respect my boundaries.

take original\_image input from FluxKontextImageScale node in your workflow, and edited\_image input from the VAEDecode node Image output.

Tinker with the mask settings if it doesn't get the results you like, I recommend setting the seed to fixed and just messing around with the mask values and running the workflow over and over until the mask fits well and your merged image looks good.  
  
This makes a HUGE difference to multiple edits in a row without the quality of the original image degrading.

Looking forward to your benchmarks and tests :D

1ls7gn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommaustralia/comments/1ls7gn3/draft_book_excerpt_would_love_your_feedback/,Draft Book Excerpt - Would Love Your Feedback,"The chapter is **Socialisation & Validation**. 

""You‚Äôve got an idea, you‚Äôre fired up about it. It‚Äôs time to get out of your own head and into the real world. You need feedback from actual humans. Not your mum. Not your mate who says ‚Äòthat‚Äôs sick‚Äô about everything. Real, would-be customers.

This stage isn‚Äôt about perfection, it‚Äôs about proof. Before you spend a cent on development, you want a signal. You want noise. You want to know people care.¬†

And ideally, if you‚Äôve followed the advice in earlier chapters, you‚Äôre already embedded in a community or category that makes this stage easier. You‚Äôve got connections. You‚Äôve got people you can tap. So tap them.

I‚Äôve observed a phenomenon in the dropshipping community whereby folk think that by setting up a dropshipping store first they‚Äôre testing their ‚Äòbigger idea‚Äô.¬†

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to start somewhere.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be mad to go to all this effort and money setting up a business if you haven‚Äôt validated it first.‚Äù*

They think that by selling some piece of junk from AliExpress, on a hastily-built Shopify store, and running some Meta ads, that they‚Äôre working out whether people are interested in something much different. This approach really misunderstands what a value proposition, a positioning, innovation, a brand are. I see it akin to wanting to open a specialty coffee shop and thinking you‚Äôre validating the idea by selling instant coffee from a can on the corner of the street.¬†

You‚Äôre speaking to a whole different set of customers, and you‚Äôre not presenting any of the stuff that might set you apart and attract attention.¬†

Hence, the majority of these attempts flop leaving the folk behind them despaired and thinking ‚Äúmaybe I wasn‚Äôt onto a good idea with that one‚Äù. But they could have been, but they just went about validating it the wrong way.¬†

# 4.1. Spaghetti Against The Wall Testing Ain‚Äôt It

Let‚Äôs call this out plainly: throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks is a rookie move.

This is what 99% of the ‚Äòdropshipper bros‚Äô are doing. Find a trending product. Slap it on a template store. Launch some ads. Hope. When it doesn‚Äôt work, they pivot to the next shiny object. Rinse. Repeat. Burnout.

That‚Äôs not validation. That‚Äôs gambling.

Instead, work like a sniper, not a shotgun. Be deliberate. Be curious. Be critical.

# 4.2. Socialise Early

The earlier you start talking about your idea, the better. Don‚Äôt wait for ‚Äòperfection‚Äô‚Äîthat moment never comes. What you want are real-world feedback loops to sharpen your concept before you invest serious time or cash.

**Share with Your Inner Circle First**

* Tell friends, family, and trusted peers what you‚Äôre building. Ask them pointed questions: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs confusing here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat would stop you from buying?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow would you explain this to a stranger?‚Äù
* Capture their comments verbatim. Those exact words often reveal hidden objections or unexpected benefits.
* Get them to connect you with others that might be interested. Talk to them. Subject them to the process.¬†

**Tap Your Online Communities (Remember, You‚Äôre Starting a Business in Familiar Territory)**

* Post a short survey or thread in niche forums, Facebook groups, or subreddits where your future customers hang out. Don‚Äôt pitch‚Äîask for honest reactions.
* Example prompt: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of launching a beginner fly-fishing kit that includes rod, reel, line, and basic flies. What would you need to see or know before you‚Äôd pre-order?‚Äù
* Collect and categorise responses: feature requests, pricing sensitivities, trust-and-service concerns.

**Leverage Your Audience Channels**

* ‚ÄäIf you have an email list or social following, share a ‚Äòsneak peek‚Äô of your product concept or early mock-ups. Include a one-click poll or simple ‚Äúreply if interested‚Äù call-to-action.
* Reward participation with a small incentive‚Äîexclusive early-bird pricing, a chance to join a private feedback group, or entry into a giveaway.

**Host Live Feedback Sessions**

* Run a quick video call or in-person meetup with enthusiasts in your space. Walk through your idea, prototypes, or website wireframes, and invite candid critique.
* Record the session and then timestamp the key ‚Äòaha‚Äô moments to revisit later.

**Build in Public**

* Document your progress on social media or a blog: share milestones (or that you‚Äôve passed a ‚ÄòSanity Gate‚Äô but more on that later in the chapter), design tweaks, supplier searches, pricing debates.
* Invite followers to vote on options (‚ÄòWhat colours should we start with?‚Äô). This not only generates feedback, but starts building a community of early adopters. People feel like they have ownership and you want that which you own to succeed, right?¬†

**Iterate & Playback**

* ‚ÄäAfter gathering feedback, group it into themes: product features, messaging clarity, pricing concerns, trust signals.
* Share back to your community: ‚ÄòThanks for telling me you‚Äôd pay $X for faster shipping‚Äînow I‚Äôm testing 24-hour dispatch. Thoughts?‚Äô This ‚Äòyou said, we did‚Äô loop builds credibility and keeps ideas aligned with real needs.

Friction Is Your Friend. If your idea can‚Äôt survive public scrutiny‚Äîif it doesn‚Äôt spark questions, pushback, or debate‚Äîit probably isn‚Äôt sharp enough yet. Embrace the discomfort, refine relentlessly, and only move forward once you‚Äôve earned the right to launch.

# 4.3. Build in Public

This is the modern version of audience-first business building. Open the curtain. Share your journey.

* Post progress updates
* Share prototypes
* Show samples
* Ask questions
* Invite feedback

You‚Äôll build trust and an early audience at the same time. And that audience will often become your first customers.

Building in public also helps keep you accountable. It creates momentum. And momentum builds businesses.

# 4.4. Sanity Gates

In my career, I‚Äôve worked in highly-structured product orgs where nothing moved from phase A to B without going through a formal stage-gate process. Strategy reviews, sign-offs, risk assessments, the works.

When I built my hiking gear brand, I adapted that idea to something more agile‚Äîbut no less rigorous. I called it the Sanity Gate model.

Instead of rigid gates and committees, I set clear checkpoints that had to ‚Äòfeel right‚Äô before I committed more time, money, or energy. They were built around confidence, traction, and validation.

Here‚Äôs what that looked like:

**Concept Gate**

Gut check. Does the idea actually solve a problem? Can I explain the who, how, and why clearly and simply?

**Signal Gate**

Can I get strangers interested? Not mates. Not hangers-on. Real people. People who won‚Äôt blow smoke up my arse.¬†

For my brand, this was initially about getting engagement on the posts I published in Facebook groups I was involved in. This graduated to email list sign ups and the like. A real, tangible indicator of interest.

**Momentum Gate**

Is traction accelerating? Are people sharing it? Is the list growing without paid traffic? If I had 50 signups but was getting 5-10 more daily, that was enough to green-light the next step.

**Buy-In Gate**

Will people part with cash? A deposit, a pre-order, or even just saying ‚Äòshut up and take my money‚Äô is a huge signal. This is where things start to feel real.

**Go/No-Go Gate**

Do I go all in, pivot, or kill it? No ego here. This checkpoint exists to save you from over-investing in a dud.

Use sanity gates to protect your time and cash. They force you to earn your way forward. No blind faith. Just earned momentum.""

First of all, let‚Äôs discuss the dynamics!
In SPADOW, Repeater has taken the role of team leader and not really given much room for discussion.
On the Fun Guys, Gravebuster is feeling like an outcast due to not being a mushroom and is hoping to prove himself to the team.
On The Logs, Squash, Torchwood and Tall Nit are all competing to be team leader.
On the Shining Stars, Split Pea feels a strange headache going on.
On Team Pult, despite their sister being on another team, the Pult brothers agree to stick together.
On The Best, Cob Cannon has taken control and created a hierarchy in the team. The order from best to worst being Gold Magnet, Split Pea, Winter Melon, Spikerock, Cat Tail, Twin Sunflower and Gloom Shroom as the lowest.
Anyways we now have the first challenge of the show, with Think_Wordiness212 the challenge is to defeat as many zombies as possible! There will be points, basics will award you 1 point, coneheads will give 2 and bucketheads will give you three! If a contestant dies during the challenge they cannot be revived, this will go for every other challenge too.
Here are the team strategies!
SPADOW will use their explosive teammates to get the most points! However, both Potato Mine and Cherry Bomb suddenly go missing before they can put their plan in affect. Meaning the remaining 6 will have to personally take out the zombies.
The Fun Guys start and end by nuking the zombies with a very willing Doom Shroom, meaning they basically guaranteed safety. I mean, who else can REALLY keep up with their amount of points after that?
The Logs realise they don‚Äôt have to be first, they just have to avoid be last, their plan is to steal kills from the other teams. Which should be a lot easier after they stole Cherry Bomb and Potato Mine.
The Shining Stars initially don‚Äôt have a plan until Plantern nominates herself to use her light to attract the zombies, which will give her team the opportunity to snipe them from afar.
Team Pult does not have a solid strategy, but the Pult Brothers don‚Äôt really need a strategy to take out zombies. However, Umbrella Leaf suggests they might get bonus style points, which the Pult brothers agree too!
The Best‚Äôs strategy is to locate where the zombies spawn and kill any zombies before they get the chance to run away for another team to kill.
Now, which team do you think will be UFE? Well, you probably will know, but atleast comment who you predicted.
The first team safe was no doubt the best with the most points at 512!
And by a wide margin, Shining Stare take second place with 476 points!
The Logs‚Äô strategy to steal kills from other teams paid off, being the third team safe with 396 points!
Escaping the bottom 2 of safety is SPADOW, despite being held back by losing their explosive teammates, Repeater‚Äôs savagery and Chomper‚Äôs endless appetite led to a comfy win at 343 points!
Now that leaves the last two teams, Fun Guys and Team Pult, one team slacked off while the other had no solid strategy except style.
And the last team safe is‚Ä¶The Fun Guys with 188 points, the only member of their team to not slack off was Fume Shroom, who took it upon himself to get more kills for his team, which was enough to save his team!
However for team Pult, it was a disaster‚Ä¶
Cabbage Pult was too polite to object to Umbrellas Leaf‚Äôs stupid suggestion.
Plant Pot would never risk Marigold‚Äôs safety, nor would poor Marigold have the heart to actually hurt anyone, even a zombie.
Kernel Pult and Melon Pult actually went with Umbrella Leaf‚Äôs style point plan.
Coffee Bean might actually have a heart attack if he even saw a zombie look at him the wrong way.
And Garlic‚Äôs stink was only enough to repel the zombies, not overload them with stink.
And obviously, the style points was a lie, they either took too long for a basic zombie or Umbrella Lead would fumble the ricochet. Their only lifeline was Winter Melon, however any kills she got for Team Pult was just added to The Best‚Äôs total, leading to a complete wipeout as Team Pult gathered a weak 13 points!

It remained as this unfulfilled thing I kept wondering about the whole semester I was back at uni.

We reconnected again December 2024, talked everyday, he kept saying how much he likes me, that he appreciates he met someone like me on Tinder considering people are so unserious and weird, and that he wants me in his life and wants to spend time with me and get to know me more. Kept asking when Im done with exams for the semester, that he cant wait to see me during winter break and have all these enjoyable conversations in person, that he'll take me out, restaurants, coffee shops, motorbike rides by the sea and that he genuinely wants to be in my presence and see how things will unfold. From what I understood, he's deep down a hopeless romantic who has been done dirty in the past and has kinda turned bitter and a player. He also does this whole trap music thing, makes songs, smokes w\*\*d, partying drinking, lyrics about sex and non-committal stuff etc... It was a red flag to me, but i didnt wanna cancel out someone because of that, i know music has genres and culture and ultimately a lifestyle behind it... Many people act tuff but doesnt mean they're criminals just cuz they like x type of music ... Even though we're very different, he's extroverted, quite popular with music etc while Im more of a loner, closed off and introverted. Yet there's this mutual pull for some reason.

I rushed my exam period to return back on the island to spend time with him. He kept saying how he cant wait to see me. Some shit goes down around January, the whole island catches a very heavy flu and everybody was sick for weeks (i live kinda isolated in the countryside when im back home so I didnt catch it). He caught it, my friends caught it, even grandparents. He said he was feeling horrible but still had to show up for work, and we kept texting and sending reels but zero substance or actual plans for anything. Nearly 2 months passed of me being on the island... I postponed internships, went out of my way considering I have a life and responsibilities abroad and he knew I was here the whole time yet didnt do shit about it... It shall be noted that during our last interaction (on a saturday), we arranged the date to happen on Tuesday (his day off) at x place, x time. 3 days go by, no text, no call, didnt hear from him again at all. Tuesday comes, nothing. Another week passes, he kept on sending me memes... I simply didnt respond again...

From that day onward, he started posting teasers of his unreleased songs he was recording on social media with hints about me/our situation, including hints that I ghosted him, left him on seen and overall very butthurt energy. Same thing with quotes, sassy butthurt captions under his posts, lyrics of songs etc, ongoing situation. I did leave him on seen, but there was clearly a reason. He didnt respect my time, energy and investment. I was genuinely SOOOO into him, wanted to get to know him, spend time and had nothing but the best intentions. He kept doing this nonstop, the entire spring semester I was back in school, even til this day.

He kept viewing my story within nanoseconds, liking everything I post, liking every meme I like from common pages etc. I didn't wish him happy birthday and I forced myself so hard not to reach out because I really cared and really wanted to wish him. But I just pulled my energy back and wanted to make it known what he did was not okay.

Now Im back on the island again for the summer season since May, working a summer job, will be here til October. Once he saw my story of a well-known beach he liked it immediately and reached out, asking if im back already. I replied with a sarcastic tone, letting him know Im not letting sh\* t slide. He didnt apologise, didnt say sorry or show willingness to address his behavior back in February. i was here nearly 2 months, we were in the same place and he didnt do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. Leading me on via text months in advance getting my hopes up. He then simply came up with the pettiest, most low-effort excuse possible - that he didnt have a vehicle and didnt wanna drag me all the way to the city center (such horse sh\*t, he was with friends all day everyday, making tiktoks, studio recordings, posting stories nonstop, excursions, he was perfectly fine - and i told him city center is no problem for me, even though i live half an hour away im coming everyday to be with grandma during morning hours). Couldn't make time for one afternoon coffee with me? After he initiated it all and kept wanting to do all these plans? He said haha gotta agree, anyway im free Tuesdays. In such a desensitised almost demanding tone, zero remorse, talking as if owe him a meetup/date after all this time. I asked him whether that's how a decent human behaves and he said no, but I would prefer to tell you whatever there is to be told in person, not from here. If you dont want that to happen i understand. That just screams manipulation to me. I left him on seen again, didnt continue the bs, there is nothing to be told really if he doesnt get it himself. Either that or he plays stupid and avoids accountability on purpose. Or he is legit brain fried by whatever he's smoking. He still hasnt stopped liking my stuff and even reached out for my birthday yesterday, posting love songs about unfulfilled love stories and fumbling, bittersweet stuff, drawings/sketches/animated female figures that look like me and a bunch of clues.

He could be screwing someone else or entertaining multiple other people at the time he was interacting with me. Im not saying I ever trusted him blindly, but I chose to set my cynicism aside for once and start anew.

NOW LETS GET TO THE POINT:

The thing is, everyone in my environment is currently gaslighting me, telling me it wasnt that deep, it didnt matter that much, it was all virtual via a screen anyway, he didn't owe you sh\* t during the talking stage and that he may actually be a really great guy in person. Maybe it's gonna be better than you could have ever imagined. My sister and friends suggest I go see him, even if nothing happens or even if I get the biggest ick imaginable, at least i wont have this ruminating ""what if"" haunting me and get it off my conscience. I know technically nobody owes you nothing during the talking stage, but it kinda does show character. Leading people on for months, giving them hope, playing around, flaking on them with plans YOU KEPT INITIATING and wouldn't shut up about, not following through with any of your promises is just madness in my books. And on top of that popping back up as if nothing happened and demanding to hang out (?) Is someone like that worth the time of day? I dont care about his lame ass excuses, I refuse to show up, sit there like a clown and have him lie to my face. Additionally, he might not even register what he did as bad or disrespectful. Maybe that's his casual way of going about people, keeping options open, Casanova energy, zero seriousness. Maybe I took it more seriously than I should have, while for him i could have been  just a random tinder swipe and nothing else. It's not worth it that I go and talk about why his behavior hurt me if he doesnt acknowledge it in the first place. Yet why all this chase and obsession on his part?

1ls73hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumHellDivers/comments/1ls73hs/new_game_modes_pitch_meeting/,New game modes pitch meeting,"So there seems to be a lot of calls for new mission types but less discussion of what mission types modes the game as built can support so I'd like to convene a discussion of:

1. New mission concepts using a basic framework of:
     From: 
     Through: 
      To: 
    

2. How viable that seems given what we know of the limitations of the game as developed so far. 

I'll throw in a couple of not necessarily good but illustrative examples:
__________________________________________
A. Gauntlet missions. A variation of eradicate 
    From: The players spawn into a restricted space on the map. They are protected from fire and view at the drop point 

Through: The map is a restricted corridor (not a literal building corridor) with obstacles cover and PoIs and enemy units spawning along its length 

To: The mission objective requires calling in a stratagem and activating it at the other end of the corridor. Or activating a console to a protected extraction 

Viability: 
The short Mission  variants are established. 
The game can already limit the players control over their hellpod. But one coding question might be on how flexible the game can be with limiting the map screen. 

With the line of sight changes the protected spawn and extract zones should be possible if not guaranteed (see Stingrays vs Generators)

The game uses conditional location all the time for mission essential stratagems so I don't see the ending being too difficult to implement. Reusing assets like the SSSD and mailbox. 

The most difficult thing to implement after the map screen seems like the spawning of enemies. You'd want them pouring in from the sides not spawning on top of the players. 

_____________________________________
B: Combat Search and Rescue Mission
     From: players must comb a whole map for a downed Pelican carrying Class A citizens 

Through: Finding the downed Pelican and calling in the Evac Pelican /holding the perimeter while the transfer umbilical is extended

To:  The CSAR Pelican connects with the transfer umbilical and leaves. 

Viability:
Hidden/semi localised objectives are already a gameplay feature. 

Timed hold the area stratagem triggered objectives are already a feature.

It would require some new or modified assets (crashed Pelican and an expanding or Pelican deployed e.g. FRV style umbilical) a more ambitious version might introduce something like a protected cabin FRV or a limited interaction version of the APC. 

The end condition is already implemented in game play but options like SEAF troops defending crash site or secondary objectives of evacuating less Class A citizens in the open could be explored.

Every now and then, a client walks into our studio with a glimmer of hope in their eyes.

They say something like, *‚ÄúTanu, we want a beautiful home‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt want it to harm the planet.‚Äù*

And honestly? That moment always gives me goosebumps. Because it means someone‚Äôs thinking beyond style. They‚Äôre thinking *legacy*.

At **Tanish Dzignz**, sustainability isn‚Äôt just a design choice‚Äîit‚Äôs a value, a responsibility, and above all, a way of showing love. Love for your family, your home, and the Earth you‚Äôll leave behind.

Let‚Äôs talk about what *sustainable custom furniture* really means‚Äîand why it might be the most meaningful decision you make while designing your space.

 **1. What Makes Furniture ‚ÄúSustainable,‚Äù Really?**

It's not about bamboo everything or skipping wood altogether. Sustainable furniture is made with intention‚Äîby choosing materials and practices that minimize harm and maximize lifespan.

It‚Äôs about:



* Using responsibly sourced wood
* Choosing low-VOC polishes and finishes
* Avoiding plastic-heavy composites
* Supporting local craftsmanship over mass factories



It‚Äôs not just what it‚Äôs made of‚Äîit‚Äôs *how* and *why* it‚Äôs made.

 **2. Conscious Wood Choices**

Wood is timeless. But not all wood is equal.

We work with **FSC-certified timber**, reclaimed teak, mango wood, and engineered options that balance durability with eco-sensitivity. These choices help us preserve forests, reduce waste, and still offer those gorgeous grains and warm tones we all love.

And when we repurpose old wood into new treasures? That‚Äôs soul work.

 **3. Safe for You. Safe for Earth.**

So many people don‚Äôt realize this‚Äîbut traditional furniture finishes often contain toxic chemicals. These volatile organic compounds (VOCs) pollute your indoor air and impact your health silently over time.

At Tanish Dzignz, we choose **low-VOC, non-toxic polishes** that are safe for your kids, your pets, and your peace of mind.

Because your home should *heal*‚Äînot harm.

 **4. Sustainable Can Be Stylish**

One big myth? That eco-friendly furniture looks ‚Äútoo raw‚Äù or ‚Äútoo earthy.‚Äù

Not at all.

From **chic minimalist coffee tables** to **ornate carved headboards**, sustainable design can be elegant, luxurious, and trend-proof. In fact, custom furniture gives us the freedom to blend aesthetics with ethics‚Äîflawlessly.

*When design is rooted in values, it automatically shines brighter.*

 **5. Supporting Local Artisans, Not Landfills**

Every time you choose custom, you‚Äôre supporting local craftsmanship and reducing industrial waste. That‚Äôs a quiet but powerful revolution.

We collaborate with skilled artisans who pour heart and soul into your pieces‚Äîensuring nothing is rushed, wasted, or impersonal.

It‚Äôs not furniture. It‚Äôs a future heirloom",1,1751711987.0,u_Tanishdzignz,0,1.0,False
1ls6ypx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1ls6ypx/why_am_i_always_sabotaging_my_cert_preparation/,Why am I always sabotaging my cert preparation?,"Perhaps this resonates with someone else. In my case, I could be reading the Sybex Linux+ book or watching Shawn Powers' video series, and suddenly I feel like I need something else to continue studying, maybe another VM with a different distro. Or even though I already have four VM disks mounted, I suddenly need additional virtual disks to play around with partitions and mounting, or perhaps the terminal I'm using doesn't feel right, and I have to find a new one. Bottom line: I end up doing something completely different than studying for the exam.

At one point, I found myself organizing my rack and networking equipment and cables. Then, restructuring the servers in my homelab and grouping Docker containers, separating internal services from those exposed to the public, this alone took the entire weekend. When I was finally done, I thought, ""Now I'm ready to study."" Shortly after, however, I found a dirt-cheap 16GB Pi 5 at the local thrift store, and I spent several days playing with it. Once again, I thought, ""Okay, now I'm ready to continue studying,"" but then I realized my Pi needed a specific 27W 5.1V 5A power supply, and I had to go out and pick one up.

This post has already extended too long, but I could keep going, and I've been doing it for months.

I love IT management. I'm very comfortable with the terminal, and since I work in tech support, I have considerable Linux experience from my job. My homelab is entirely Linux based, and I love Docker containers. I put everything possible into Docker. But I am still not ready for this Linux+ exam.

Knowing myself, I decided to buy the exam voucher right now which I did, hoping that if I waited too long, new exam objectives would come out, potentially undermining everything I've learned so far and making my procrastination worse. This exam is very expensive, so I can't just casually take it to see how it goes with my current knowledge level and then retake it later while trying to calculate the amount of effort I should put into this. Instead I want to go all out on the first attempt.

This is a personal challenge. Since I love this stuff so much, I thought Linux+ would be a nice complement to my CV, with possibly Server+ in the future. So I'm not being pressured at work or anything. Maybe that's my problem.

Is anyone else in my position? What are you doing to overcome this?

**Funny side note**: It's currently 4 AM as I write this post. Between coffee breaks and a great sandwich, I've wasted about 90 minutes that could have been perfectly used for studying during such a quiet and peaceful hour. :D",5,1751711956.0,CompTIA,6,0.78,False

Just recently, I finally said yes to his proposal.

But the night before our wedding, I overheard something I was never supposed to hear.

""Sloane Mercer? She's as dull as drywall. If it weren't for the mission, I wouldn't even look at her.""

""Once I secure the wedding, the second it's done, I'm dumping her ass.""

I pretended I didn't hear a thing.

I played along‚Äîright up until the wedding.

Then I walked away without looking back.

Later, my friend told me that cold, composed Professor Vaughn lost it for the first time‚Äîright there in front of a whole room full of stunned guests.

\---

Everett always wore that calm, untouchable mask in public.

So when I saw him holding hands with another woman, smiling like a goddamn fairytale, I froze.

The wedding was just days away.

I'd just stepped out of the bridal boutique, still half-floating from trying on my gown.

Then I got in my car‚Äîand saw him.

My fianc√©. Everett Vaughn.

The same Everett who'd told me he was too busy with work to meet today.

Now he was standing on a crowded downtown sidewalk‚Ä¶

Making out with some girl like the world didn't even exist.

It was like someone dumped a bucket of ice water over me.

Two hours ago, he held me and said I was the only woman he'd ever love.

Now he was kissing someone else like I never even existed.

I couldn't believe my eyes.

I don't know how long I sat there, staring like a ghost.

Eventually, my hand moved on its own‚ÄîI called him.

A few feet away, Everett flinched at the ringtone.

His smile vanished, jaw tightening just a bit.

Still, he answered.

""Hey, babe,"" he said, voice soft as ever.

""Miss me already?""

It was the same charming voice I'd fallen for.

My heart twisted so hard I thought it might split open. My mind was blank.

""Everett‚Ä¶ what are you doing right now?""

He chuckled, low and warm. Like everything was fine.

""Just wrapped up a lecture, sweetheart.""

""Was about to grab that cake you love. Be home soon, okay?""

He sounded so natural. Not a crack in his act.

Then‚Äîhe reached over and ran his fingers through the other girl's hair.

So casually. So gently.

I watched them, numb, tears sliding down my cheeks before I could stop them.

I'd thought Everett was the answer to the broken pieces of my life.

I thought he was my safe place, my ending.

But this?

This was never love.

It was a goddamn lie.

He chased me for three years.

And under a rain of flowers and applause, I said yes.

I thought it was forever.

Turned out it was all just a setup.

It took me a long time to find my voice.

""Sure,"" I whispered. ""I'll be waiting.""

Chapter 2

Everett came back not long after.

His expression was as soft as always‚Äîthose eyes practically dripping with affection when they landed on me.

He set the little cake box down on the table, then walked over and wrapped his arms around me, resting his chin gently on my shoulder like we were the only two people on Earth.

""God, I missed you,"" he whispered.

""I keep thinking‚Äîwe're getting married in just two weeks, and I can't even handle how happy that makes me‚Ä¶""

I just stood there, numb. Empty.

I hadn't figured out how to even process the betrayal, let alone confront it.

I stepped out of his embrace.

""I'm tired. I think I'll lie down for a bit.""

He kissed me lightly on the cheek.

""Of course, baby. Go rest. I'm gonna shower real quick.""

Mind spinning, I walked toward the bedroom‚Äîonly to realize I'd left my phone on the coffee table.

As I passed the bathroom, I heard his voice.

""System, where's her affection level at?""

""Congratulations, Host. Target's affection level has reached ninety-eight percent.""

Everett let out a laugh‚Äîlow, giddy, like he was finally winning something.

""Finally! God, these last three years have been pure hell.""

""Sloane Mercer is such a damn bore.""

""If it wasn't for the mission, I wouldn't even look at her!""

""Soon as I marry her and the mission's done, I'm dumping her ass‚Äîno hesitation.""

Then that‚Ä¶ whatever it was‚Äîthe ""System""‚Äîspoke again.

""Host, are you saying there's not even a sliver of genuine feeling for her?""

Everett chuckled. Arrogant. Cruel.

""For her? Are you kidding?""

""I'd have to be out of my damn mind. She's dull as dry toast.""

First of all, here is my ""standard"" recipe:

- 1 full, flat scoop of finely pre-ground, dark coffee.
- 100 ml of water (85-90¬∞C).
- Swirl gently for a bit until it's mixed.
- Put plunger on and let it steep for 2-3 minutes, then press.

I'm also using the official flow control accessory, so I've been getting a consistently good cup of espresso-like coffee with this method for months now, pretty happy with it.

The reason I'm using off the shelf, pre-ground coffee is because I really couldn't get good results grinding my own coffee with my Chestnut C2, despite trying lots of coffee and grind size combinations, and supposedly better quality coffee (any advice on this regard is welcome too).

Then one day I found this ""specialty"" coffee in a specific supermarket, where they have variants from many countries, and I decided to try them all. They're more expensive than your regular low quality coffee (about 4‚Ç¨ for a 250g bag), but I finally settled on a variant from Ethiopia and I've been pleasantly surprised.

My main issue, however, is making coffee for 2.

I've tried doubling the amounts (2 scoops, 200 ml of water), but the result is just... not the same? I get a bitter/acidic taste, very different from the flavour that comes out of my single shot recipe, and not pleasant at all.

I've tried increasing the amount of water to 200 ml, as well as stirring with the included accessory to ensure a better mix. But I didn't notice any improvement.

Any advice or ideas on what I should be doing differently when brewing two cups together?",6,1751711418.0,AeroPress,5,0.88,False

For the first time after a long time , I took my BMI (I am 35) , and it was a shocking 32.3 (even though im sure I have some muscles so my muscle mass may increase it a bit). My stats are as follows :

My height is 165 cm (yes i know I am short) , and my weight is 88 kg (I have some muscle as I do some weight training, but I am still overweight though). My friends say that I do look a bit fit from the outside but I know that I am fat in certain/many parts of my body

My daily intake of food are as follows:

**Breakfast : Two slices of white bread (plain white bread with a slice of cheese)**

**Lunch : Two slices of chicken sandwich (the ones with a bit of mayo, its called chicken salad in bread)**

**Tea time : A glass of hot chocolate milk occasionally**

**Dinner : Brown rice and 2 chicken thighs and vegetables and an apple**

**Post Dinner : Maybe warm milk**

The thing is I have been developing neck strain for the past 2 nights , and decided to see a cardiologist as I was worried it could be something to do with my heart. And as expected , the cardiologist told me that my Blood Pressure was¬†**170/100 and have hypertension**. My sodium levels are low and I dont drink alcohol, dont drink coffee , no tea and definitely dont smoke . So the doctor told me that it is probably genetics and the only natural way (without medication) that I can do is to lose 20 kg to lower my Blood Pressure.

May I please ask , what should I do to lose weight , as in what exercise should I do , cardio , weight training or both ? Any tips and tricks to lose 20 kg fast ?

There is a lot of space - left-to-right wall is 4.5m long, while the sofa is 1.8m deep (for the chaise part) and 3.3m long. The chaise will be on the window-side.

Based on the design and colour of the sofa, how would you furnish the rest of this room? I prefer a modern-cosy design/environment -- cold minimalism and sharp corners / boxy furniture is not our style. I have a huge white/grey/beige shaggy rug which will go in front of and under the sofa. My current thoughts are:

* Coffee table - maybe a light-medium brown wooden one or on with a (faux) marble tabletop?
* Side tables (sofa arms are 55cm tall) - matching/similar to the coffee table?
* Narrow-depth console unit -- to go behind the sofa so that the sofa is not so far away from the TV and without there being an awkward empty space
* TV unit (for 50"" TV) -- probably quite long to balance with the long sofa.

I‚Äôm thinking of using  my Lightning wallet (Phoenix)for small daily purchases (coffee, transit, etc.) and avoiding traditional exchange fees or banks.

1ls6q25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ls6q25/i_have_had_psychical_pain_from_age_8_now_26_f_and/,"I have had psychical pain from age 8, now 26 f and can barely cope. Have seen 9+ doctors in 4 years.","Hi, 
When I was 8 years old, I started complaining of back pain. I had to drop out of the small extra curriculars in elementary school I had signed up for, like crosswalk patrol, as holding signs worsened my pain and I could not hold my arm out straight for more than a few minutes. 
The doctor said to switch my mattress, and look into yoga. 

At 15, trying to get off the couch would sometimes be (what i assume to be) similar to dislocating my hip. I would feel the joint roll out, and until I could position it back into place and feel a pop, I would be in horrible pain trying to move, and could not get up at all. This still happens, mostly to my hip, sometimes other joints. 

Every year I feel more aches and pains in different places, everything getting gradually more painful, and deal with it daily in varying degrees. Most days I take about twice the reccomended dosage of ibuprofen and still don't feel like a normal person. A few times a year, I have horrible pain flair ups where I can barely walk to get myself to the bathroom, for days at a time. I can't sleep from pain, I can't function, and I try my best to manage it all so I can work and keep myself alive. 

When I stretch, it feels like I've pulled something. Every joint pops and cracks through the day and I rough through. 

I have constant headaches, frequent migraines,severe motion sickness and dizziness that can set off from just looking up. My neck/wrists/hips/knees/ankles/back/elbows/shoulders/pretty much everything have constant issues. 
It feels primarily in my joints and muscles. 

I've spent periods of time being active(hiking, climbing, yoga), taking vitamins, and being extremely healthy in every aspect.
I've also spent periods of time in bed for months, resting between tasks, eating nutritious easy foods, and just overall resting. I have a very noticable difference, that I'm much more severe pain when trying to be an active person, even in just a simple, normal person amount.

The last few months I've been switching between bare knees, and k taped knees, and there is a massive difference, benefitting greatly from the k tape. Sometimes it feels like my knees bend backwards, or.. weird to explain.. what I feel chair legs probably feel like when they're about to break. 

In a 4 year span, I saw 9 doctors, they all looked at my spine and told me it looks fine, theres nothing wrong. This is not including all the other random doctors I've told through the last 18 years.
I've been told:
I'm just anxious, so its in my imagination. 
I'm skinny, so I have more pressure on my joints. 
I don't take enough vitamins(i always do). 
It's just a female thing, hormones and whatnot. 
And I have been ACCUSED OF DRUG SEEKING MULTIPLE TIMES, WHEN ALL I ASK FOR IS TESTS AND ANSWERS. Not bringing up pain killers or drugs at all. I want answers!! Not drugs!!

I'm in the Canadian Healthcare system, so its hard to find a doctor in general, let alone one that has time to listen, and the compassion to believe me. 
I've been told that even if they send out a refferal for tests or scans, that it would take 2 years for them to see my paperwork, and it will just get thrown out so there's no point in even sending it at all. 

I'm at the point that I believe I will be begging for our medically assisted death program in 10 years, because every year I get worse, it gets harder to take care of myself, and every year I'm in more pain and less hopeful. 

I take advil before my morning coffee on the days i work (and through the day, every few hours. I also take advil breaks for days at a time and let myself feel the pain and writhe in pain to the point I can't eat or sleep, as i know its not good for me and my need to limit my consumption), and every night I ice and heat my body, elevate my legs, use cannabis lotions, and still can't find life manageable with this pain. I'm always exhausted.

I have adult onset (pretty well controlled) type 1 diabeties. I was diagnosed at 21. I've heard one autoimmune disease can make you more susceptible to others, but age 8 pain, age 21 t1d... I'm not looking at that too closely. 
I've been on and off various ssri's and others since I was 14.
Yes, I know the body can hold trauma, and yes, I'm in therapy and have been for a long time. I'm mostly mentally well and feeling confidant in that aspect, I have not felt much, if any, correlation between my physical and mental health at any point. I have monitored it. 
I'm horribly allergic to perfumes/smells, and have some kind of bowel issues. Always between either constipation or diharhea. Rare for something healthy in there..

I have a cousin with hyper mobile Ehlers danlos, and another cousin with something that got her upper rib removed because of nerve degeneration(?) and circulation problems or something. Multiple grandfather's from both my mothers and fathers side developed cancer quickly and died after either a back injury, or back surgery. Lots of history of back problems in the men in both sides of my family, I am a female, with possibly the worst luck of all our lineage.  

Admittedly, I did spend just under a year on harder drugs(last year) just to be able to function like a normal person, to have enough energy to accomplish as much in every day life as my peers. I am sober again** but even if I wasn't, ive had this pain a lot longer than i was on drugs. no input from doctors in this regard as I've (hopefully temporally) given up on doctors. This post is on a whim, as a bit of hope or guidance on what to do, how to fight for my right to live, that I might be able to eventually have a diagnosis and live the full life I've always wanted because I might know how to best manage all this.
