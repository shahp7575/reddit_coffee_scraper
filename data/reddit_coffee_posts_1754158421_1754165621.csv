1mg01v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mg01v1/can_amazon_basics_cm9409tul_coffeemakers_features/,Can Amazon Basics CM9409T-UL Coffeemaker's features compete? Comprehensive review reveals all!,"The Amazon Basics CM9409T-UL Programmable Coffeemaker with Carafe and Reusable Filter has been a staple in my kitchen for weeks, and I’ve put it to rigorous use every day. As someone who can’t function without a good caffeine kickstart, testing this coffee maker has been a blend of practicality and curiosity. It promises convenience, durability, and style, but some aspects leave room for improvement. Here’s my take on this drip brewing machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was the sleek, modern design. The black and stainless steel combination gives this coffee maker a polished appearance, blending into my kitchen decor effortlessly. Compact in size, it fits well even in smaller spaces—think apartment kitchens or cozy countertops. At just 5.07 pounds, it was light enough to move around when needed but still felt sturdier than I expected. The carafe is drip-free, a thoughtful touch, especially for clumsy early mornings when the coffee has to find its way to your cup, not your counter. While the reusable filter is a money-saver and eco-friendly, the plastic components around it made me question its longevity over a year of daily use. 

**Ease of Use**  
This device is all about being user-friendly. The programmable features made it remarkably easy to set a timer the night before, so I’d wake up to the heavenly aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The buttons are tactile, straightforward, and do not require a master’s degree to figure out. However, setting up the reusable filter took a bit of figuring out for me initially—but once that was sorted, the cleaning process was a breeze. I’m delighted to skip those annoying disposable paper filters while keeping maintenance at bay. The warming plate is another fantastic inclusion that kept my coffee hot without making it taste burnt. However, if you’re someone who loves intricate coffee customizations, this machine does not offer advanced settings or barista-level controls.

**Brewing Performance**  
For its price range, this coffeemaker delivers in terms of brewing consistency. The 12-cup capacity meant I could make enough coffee at once for Saturday brunches with friends. But since I live alone, I mostly filled it only halfway, which still produced a balanced and flavorful cup. An important note: the grind size and coffee amount directly impact how well this machine performs. I experimented with medium and coarse grinds, adjusting quantities until I hit the sweet spot. That said, while the coffee tasted perfect when I got it right, the lack of an integrated grinder makes it less versatile for serious coffee enthusiasts.

**Upsides**  
- Sleek, space-saving design that fits into kitchens of all sizes.  
- Affordable and reusable filter basket eliminates recurring filter costs.  
- Automatic brewing with programmable settings is perfect for busy mornings.  
- The warming plate maintains coffee warmth without scorching it.  

**Critiques**  
- Limited coffee customization options; not ideal for advanced coffee brewers.  
- Reusable filter is good but feels slightly flimsy and could wear out with frequent use.  

**Who Should Buy It?**  
This coffee maker targets anyone looking for a reliable, no-fuss, and budget-friendly option. It’s perfect for small families, students, or professionals who just need a solid cup of coffee—day in and day out. It worked wonders for my mornings, but I could see it being equally effective in an office breakroom setting. If, however, you’re someone who thrives on making pour-overs, lattes, or espresso-based drinks, you’ll likely notice the limitations of this machine.

**Market Rivals**  
While this Amazon Basics Coffee Maker has earned its spot as a practical household appliance, it does face stiff competition in the budget coffee maker market. Take the Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer as an example. It offers a dual brewing option, letting users switch between single-serve brewing and a full pot. However, the Amazon Basics model performs better in terms of compactness and ease of maintenance. Then there’s the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffeemaker, which rivals it with similar features but often lacks the drip-free carafe design. While fancier options like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 boast more personalization settings, they come with a heftier price tag, making the Amazon Basics an obvious pick for the cost-conscious buyer.

**Cost Efficiency**  
On the affordability scale, this coffee maker is a standout. While it doesn’t come with bells and whistles, what it does offer is utterly practical for its cost. I weighed this machine against more expensive models, and though I missed the flexibility higher-end machines provide, the Amazon Basics Programmable Coffeemaker strikes an excellent price-to-quality ratio in delivering consistent performance for daily use. If you’re on a budget and value straightforward functionality, this product is definitely worth considering.

Chapter 6: The New Echo

Detective Samuel “Sam” Carter stood in front of the grimy window of the precinct’s break room, staring out at the city. His reflection barely visible in the cracked glass, he could almost taste the dust in the air. Dallas was a place of contradictions: bright lights, big cars, and ambition. But there was a darker side to it, one that seemed to swallow up the truth.

Sam had always been able to see things others couldn’t. From a young age, he could pick up on the threads of people’s lives—the way their stories didn’t quite add up, how details skipped past others unnoticed. It wasn’t always a gift, though. It was more like a curse. Growing up in the foster system, he had learned to read people quickly. You had to, to survive. But over the years, it had sharpened into something more. It was why he was here, assigned to one of the toughest and most thankless departments—cold cases.

Before he became a detective, Sam had spent years on the streets. His sharp eye for detail earned him a reputation, but it wasn’t always for the right reasons. Some people called him obsessive. Some called him a workaholic. But after seeing so many cases go cold, he became determined to fix what was broken. That’s how he ended up with this assignment—fresh out of a few rough years working narcotics and violent crimes. The brass saw something in him, something they thought could bring fresh blood to the department’s oldest, most unsolvable mysteries.

“Hey, Carter. The DA wants to see you in her office,” a voice said behind him.

Sam turned to see his new partner, Detective Mia Torres, standing in the doorway. Mia had been on the force longer than him, but they’d only just been paired up. She was quiet, focused, and had a reputation for solving cases that others had given up on. Her sharp mind and dry humor made her a good fit for a guy like Sam.

""Got it,"" he said, pushing off the counter and following her through the narrow hallway of the precinct. He hadn’t expected a warm welcome, cold cases weren’t sexy, after all—but he wasn’t here for applause. He was here to dig up the bones buried deep under the city’s surface.

They reached the DA’s office, and the door swung open before Sam could knock. Inside, District Attorney Veronica Palmer sat behind her desk, a sharp woman in her late forties with dark eyes that didn’t miss a thing. To her right stood Chief of Police Reginald Moore, a towering figure who had seen his share of battles in the city’s criminal underworld.

Sam greeted them with a curt nod.

“Carter,” Palmer said, her voice smooth but firm. “I hear you’ve been looking into some of our cold cases. We’ve got some files stacked up, and frankly, we need someone who can see things others miss.”

“I don’t miss much,” Sam replied, his tone just as serious. “I’ve been going through the oldest cases. There are patterns in these things—if you look closely.”

Chief Moore leaned forward, his deep voice rumbling. “We know. But these cases are dead in the water. If anyone could’ve solved them, they would have. You’re not here to waste your time on ghosts, Carter. We need answers. You’re not just chasing old leads. We need closure for these families.”

Sam paused, eyeing the two of them. He could tell that the DA wasn’t just talking about the victims, but about herself. Palmer had spent years trying to bring justice to families, but even she knew the cold case files were a black hole.

“I understand,” Sam said. “But sometimes the truth is hiding in plain sight. It’s just a matter of connecting the dots. Let me dig into the cold cases, and I’ll find something. I’ll find connections.”

Mia’s expression softened a fraction. She knew Sam’s reputation for seeing patterns when others couldn’t. He wasn’t like most detectives. He didn’t just see a string of disjointed incidents. He saw the flow, the way things bled together, connecting across time and space.

“Do what you need to do,” Palmer said. “But just know—no one here is holding their breath for a miracle. The mayor’s breathing down our necks to close some of these, and we don’t have time for wild goose chases.”

Sam nodded. He wasn’t after miracles. Just answers.

Hours later, Sam sat in his small office, the door cracked open to the bullpen beyond. His desk was piled high with files, photos, and handwritten notes. Cold cases. Files from the last five years. His fingers traced over the names—victims who had once been someone’s daughter, sister, friend. People who’d vanished without a trace, leaving behind nothing but an unsolved case number.

His eyes drifted to a file that had been sitting on the corner of his desk for days. It was marked with a single name: Madison Rios. He opened the file and scanned through the details—art major, college senior, found dead in a stairwell downtown. A case that had never been solved, and one of the more recent ones.

Then, as his eyes flicked over the crime scene photos, he noticed something strange. A torn page from a sketchbook, almost buried under a pile of forensic reports. The words written there caught his attention:

""Paint me in silence.""

He froze.

That wasn’t like any note a killer would leave.

Sam’s fingers moved swiftly as he flipped through the file, now hype focused. Another victim. Deborah Ann King, a warehouse worker found behind an old theater. A folded note in her jacket read:

""The Echo That Bled.""

He leaned back in his chair, feeling a stir of unease in his chest. The cases weren’t connected by just the method of killing—there was something else. A message.

He flipped to the next case in the pile: Jessica Nguyen. The receipt tucked into her boot said:

""Echoes don’t lie.""

And finally, Mia Bell—her case not even a year old. Her final note:

""Your voice woke me.""

His heart skipped a beat.

Sam knew a pattern when he saw one. These weren’t random. These weren’t just victim statements. These were messages. The same tone. The same rhythm.

He opened a new document on his laptop, typing the names, the phrases, and the dates.

Madison – 2019
Deborah – 2020
Jessica – 2021
Mia – 2022

The rhythm was undeniable. One each year, each with a message.

It was clear now—these cases were connected.

Sam stared at the screen, his mind racing. He wasn’t sure who had been behind the killings yet, but he was certain of one thing: these weren’t isolated incidents.

He reached for the phone, dialing the DA’s office. His gut was telling him something was about to break wide open. It was time to talk to the higher-ups.

“Carter,” Palmer answered, a hint of impatience in her tone.

“I think I’m onto something,” Sam said, his voice low but urgent. “There’s a pattern. It’s not just random. These cases are connected, and I need resources to track down whoever's behind them. We can’t let this slip through our fingers.”

There was a pause on the other end.

“Meet me in my office. Now,” Palmer said, her voice firm. “And bring your findings.”

Sam’s stomach tightened. He had no doubt that what he was about to present would change everything. He didn’t yet know who David was, or that his podcast had been following the same trail, but in this moment, the path he was following felt like it had just crossed into dangerous territory.

He grabbed the files and stood, the weight of what he was about to uncover settling over him like a heavy coat. It was time to connect the dots.

Chapter 7: The Echo's Keeper

on the other side of town

The night air was thick with the sounds of distant traffic, the hum of a city that never truly slept. 

Eric Lane.

He’d been watching him for weeks. The music producer with the warm smile and the easy laugh. Too loud for a man so ordinary, too quiet in all the wrong places.

The Keeper saw much of Eric he remember him, his voice once a child now a man. His eyes had already mapped out the contours of the man’s life, like an artist sketching the outline of a figure they would never paint. Eric was nothing more than a note in the melody, another victim, another piece of the puzzle.

The Keeper had always been a listener. He had to be. It was the only way to hear the truth. The unseen whispers, the forgotten cries, the voices that had no place in the world—those were the ones that mattered.

It had all begun with Regina. A ghost in a world that didn’t care to remember her. The Echo hadn’t meant to start with her again, but when he’d heard the name ""Cassandra"", a forgotten truth in David's voice, something had shifted. Someone had finally noticed.

It was the same with Eric. The man’s life was a record, playing in the background of the city’s noise. A life of quiet routine and saddened past. But it was the cracks in the surface that mattered. He was starting to fade, slipping through the cracks, unnoticed. And that was the moment the killer had chosen him. Not for what he was, but for what he could become.

Eric had a soft voice, melodic hum that carried under the surface. There was a song buried in him. The Echo had heard it the first time he’d walked past the music studio it remind him of child he knew talking to the TV news about his late mother, the faint echoes of sound slipping out into the night. Not much. But enough to know.

A victim is never just a victim. Not to the killer. They’re a bridge. A bridge to something greater. A message.

The night had come. The stars had watched as he followed Eric’s familiar path, his footsteps echoing softly against the cracked pavement. The killer was careful, patient. He knew the rhythm of the streets. He had learned it over the time, watching, waiting for the right moment. He wasn’t like the others. He didn’t rush. He didn’t force the world into his design.

Eric had stopped near a dark alley, and the Whisperer had seen his chance. He’d been prepared—he always was. The silent step, the quiet presence. A note, folded and waiting. One message.

And then, just like that, Eric had been taken. No violence, no unnecessary struggle. Just silence. The silence that had been written. The killer had left him there, alone, cold, with a message.

""The Voice That Died"".

But that wasn’t the end. The killer wasn’t finished yet. There was still more to do. He watched as the police arrived, the red and blue lights flashing in the distance. They were slow, taking their time, walking over the familiar ground that he knew better than anyone. They didn’t hear the voices.

But he did.

He stood at the edge of the crowd, distant, observing. The investigators were busy. The detective with the dark eyes—Sam Carter—was already there, examining the scene. The killer knew the man. He had heard his name in the news ""New detective assign to  cold cases in the Dallas area"". Sam Carter. Another listener, another seeker. They were alike, but not the same. The Whisperer smiled quietly to himself.

And then, in the midst of the chaos, the keeper slipped a pair of earbuds into his ears, the sounds of the night blending with the soft hum of the latest episode of David’s podcast.

The episode was nothing out of the ordinary, a typical dive into the unspoken stories of the city's darker corners. David’s voice, smooth and calculated, filled his mind as he stood there, blending with the crowd.

As Sam Carter crouched beside Eric’s lifeless body, the killer couldn’t help but hear the echo of the moment—the final note in the long, quiet composition.

The sirens faded into the night.

but the whispers continued.

Chapter 8: The Voice That Called Him

Moments before the attack

Sam stood before the DA’s desk, the file spread out in front of him like a collection of loose threads waiting to be woven together. Palmer’s sharp gaze never wavered as she scanned through the notes, while Chief Moore leaned against the wall, arms folded across his chest.

“This is what I’ve got,” Sam said, his voice steady despite the adrenaline that buzzed in his chest. “There are five cases. Four victims. All connected by a series of cryptic phrases—each one left behind by the killer in a way that can’t be coincidence.”

Palmer raised an eyebrow. “Cryptic phrases?”

“Messages,” Sam continued. “Regina McClain, Madison Rios, Deborah Ann King, Jessica Nguyen, and Mia Bell. Each case had a strange note. These weren’t just random, off-the-cuff statements. These were deliberate. They’re almost poetic.”

He flipped through the file, showing them the lines one by one.

“Paint me in silence” He paused, glancing at both of them. ""He hears you"" “The Echo That Bled"" ""Echoes don’t lie"" And ""Your voice woke me"".

Chief Moore frowned, pushing off from the wall. “So, we’ve got a Serial killer leaving cryptic messages, but Why?”

Sam’s eyes met his. “The pattern is clear. Each victim was chosen carefully, each method precise. No sign of forced entry, no sexual assault, no robbery. Just death. But it’s the rhythm that’s important—one victim a year, the notes each year building upon the last.”

“The first was in 2018,” Sam continued, pointing to the timeline on his digital map. “Then 2019, 2020, 2021, and now 2022. The killer’s following a schedule, and it’s methodical. The notes themselves have a consistent tone, almost like they’re speaking to someone... or something.”

“And you think all of this points to the same killer?” Palmer asked, her voice low, skeptical.

“I’m not just guessing,” Sam said, tapping the screen. “These phrases? They’re connected. They’re almost like parts of a riddle, a puzzle that only the killer understands. It’s not random. It’s deliberate. There’s someone out there sending a message, and if we don’t catch it now, the next victim could be right around the corner.”

There was a long pause as the DA and Chief Moore exchanged a look. Palmer finally broke the silence.

“Alright, Carter,” she said, leaning back in her chair. “We’ll give you the resources. But you better have something concrete. We’ve been chasing ghosts for too long, and the mayor wants results.”

Sam nodded, his jaw set. He’d seen how cold cases could drag on, how bureaucracy could grind down any hope of progress. But this wasn’t just another case. He could feel it in his bones. This was different.

Before he could say more, his phone buzzed on the table. he saw the caller ID—Detective Torres.

He picked up immediately.

“Carter,” Mia’s voice crackled through the receiver, sharp with urgency. “You need to get to the scene. Now.”

“What happened?” Sam asked, his pulse quickening.

“It’s... it’s a murder, Sam. A man was found dead in an alley, and there’s something... strange about it. The victim’s name is Eric Lane.”

Sam’s mind raced, but he kept his voice steady. “Eric Lane. What’s strange about it?”

“I don’t know yet, but the body’s—there’s something odd. A note was found with him. I need you here, Sam.”

Sam’s stomach twisted. He knew this could be nothing. But it also could be everything. He didn’t have time to waste.

“I’m on my way.”

an hour later...

The sun had barely begun to dip behind the skyline as Sam pulled up to the crime scene. The flashing blue and red lights bathed the alley in an eerie glow, casting shadows that stretched long across the pavement. A small crowd of onlookers was being held back by uniformed officers, and the air was thick with tension.

Mia stood near the edge of the scene, her expression grim.

“Where’s the body?” Sam asked, scanning the area.

“Over here,” Mia said, leading him to the far end of the alley. The victim was a man in his mid-thirties, his body slumped against the side of a dumpster, the life drained from him. His clothes were nondescript, nothing that stood out as unusual. But what caught Sam’s attention immediately was the note—this time, it was taped to the man’s chest.

He pulled the note free with gloved hands and held it up. The message was stark, clear, and chilling:

“The Voice That Died.”

Sam’s blood ran cold. The phrasing was even more direct than before—no metaphor, no ambiguity. This was a statement. A final word. And it felt more personal than the others.

“Who is he?” Sam asked, turning back to Mia.

Mia replied, her voice tight. “He's a local music producer. No criminal record, no ties to anything shady.”

Sam’s mind raced. Another victim. Another puzzle piece. But this time, there was something more—something different about the note. It wasn’t just a cryptic message. It was an accusation. A condemnation. The killer had left a deliberate mark, but the victim didn’t feel like an innocent bystander. It felt... deliberate.

Mia glanced at Sam, her eyes searching his face. “What do you think, Sam?”

He shook his head, still staring at the note. “I think... this is connected. This isn’t just some random act of violence. This is our guy.”

“What do you mean, ‘our guy’?” Mia asked, confused.

“The Speaker,” Sam said, the name suddenly slipping from his lips. The killer was now becoming something more an identity that was taking shape. “This is his work. The rhythm, the phrases, they’re all part of the same pattern. The Speaker doesn’t just kill. He sends messages.”

Mia blinked, processing. “The Speaker? Really that name?”

“Yes,” Sam replied, voice steady. “This Killer he's escalating. Each time, the phrases get bolder, more direct. ‘The Voice That Died.’ It’s not a coincidence.”

Mia stepped back, looking at the body again. “We need to notify the higher-ups. This changes everything.”

Sam nodded, but his mind was already far ahead. “I already took care of it.”

Meanwhile, miles away, David sat in front of his computer, his fingers moving quickly over the keys. He’d just seen the news about the latest murder—Eric Lane. He couldn’t explain why, but something clicked when he heard the victim’s name.

""Eric Lane,"" he whispered to himself. His heart raced as his fingers typed in the search bar.

The more he read about the man, the more certain he became: this wasn’t just another random victim. This was part of something bigger. Something he had been chasing for months.

David’s eyes flicked to the corkboard on his wall, still covered in case files, pins, and yarn connecting names and dates. And there it was: in a cut newspaper ""Orphan Child Eric Lane, Mother Natasha Lane murder in alley"". He stared at the name. Something in his gut told him this was the moment he’d been waiting for.

The note left with Eric Lane the one David would likely hear about soon—had sealed it for him. The phrase was personal. It wasn’t a message for the world. It was a message for him.

“The Voice That Died.”

The Whisperer talking to him.

For the first time in Years, David felt the pull of the case sharpen. The killer wasn’t just leaving cryptic notes. He was sending messages directly to someone. And David knew, instinctively, that he was the one being spoken to.

This wasn’t just about finding answers anymore. This was about understanding the message.

And David was starting to realize that The Whisperer wanted him to hear it.

Chapter 9: Through the Echoes

The alley was colder than it should’ve been.

Sam Carter stood at the scene long after the forensics team had packed up. The body was gone. The blood had been washed into the gutter. But the echo of it—that moment still lingered in the air.

He stared at the brick wall where Eric Lane’s body had slumped, the taped note now sitting in an evidence bag inside his coat pocket.

""The Voice That Died"".

A phrase that didn’t just sound poetic—it sounded intentional. Like the others.

He knew the other cases were connected. He was sure of it now. But this one? This one was louder, Bolder.

""Pull all security footage from within a three-block radius,"" Sam had told a patrol officer earlier that evening. ""I want everything. Street cams. Doorbell cams. I don’t care if it’s grainy—I want it.""

Hours later, inside the precinct’s cramped AV room, he sat in front of a bank of monitors as footage flickered past in silence.

He was on his third cup of coffee and his fifth hour of footage when he finally saw it.

At first, it looked like nothing. Just a crowd forming behind the police tape, faces turned to flashing lights, some filming on their phones. Normal.

But then there. In the corner of one camera’s wide lens.

A figure. Still. Watching.

Not reacting. Not recording. Just present.

The timestamp was 8:12 p.m.—minutes after the scene had been secured. The man was standing half in shadow, his face obscured beneath the hood of a black jacket, the light from the patrol car reflecting off his silhouette like a smear of ink.

Sam leaned in, heart quickening. He froze the frame and enhanced it as much as the ancient system allowed.

No clear face.

But the stance was… familiar. Controlled. Deliberate. Everyone else was moving. Talking. Taking photos. This man was still. Focused. Listening.

“Got you,” Sam muttered under his breath.

He printed the frame and pinned it to the corkboard in his office, right next to the notes from the other murders.

A new question took shape in his mind—not who is the killer. But how long has he been watching?

Because if he was bold enough to come back to the scene…

He might already know who’s following him.

David hadn’t slept.

The coffee had gone cold hours ago, abandoned beside his laptop as lines of text blinked back at him on the screen. He’d spent the last day spiraling down the dark well of his own archives. Old episodes. Listener tips. Interviews he hadn’t thought about in years.

But it had been the messages that cracked it open.

They had always haunted him, but now, they spoke.

He’d stumbled across a pattern buried in an old spreadsheet he used to track cold cases for a bonus series back in 2022. Back then, they’d seemed disconnected. But now…

and There were two more.

1995 Dallas. A waitress named Emily Monroe. Killed in a parking garage. Shot, execution-style. A note found in her apron pocket: “Whispers carry farther than screams.”

The city had forgotten.

But the killer hadn’t.

David sat back in his chair, staring at the web of cases pinned across his corkboard. He connected them one by one, the red yarn crossing years, lives, and neighborhoods like arteries. A timeline of silence: 1994-98

Then nothing. For two decades, the voices went quiet.

Until 2018.

He didn’t know what woke him back up. But he knew what had happened since. The voice had returned. Subtle at first. Unnoticed. Then louder. Sharper.

Eric Lane was the scream in a long line of whispers.

David’s fingers hovered over his keyboard as he opened a new project folder.

EPISODE 59 – THE WHISPERER

He’d never directly talk to the killer on the episodes. But this one is different.

This wasn’t just another story.

It was a revelation.

For the first time, the city would hear it. Every clue. Every name. Every echo left behind.

A serial killer was moving through their streets.

And David was about to say his name.

He reached for the mic.

Paused.

Took a breath.

And hit record.

Chapter 9: The Silence Breaks

David

The mic blinked red—recording.

David leaned forward, voice low, calm, but electric with tension.

“You’re about to hear something I’ve never done on this podcast before. Not just a case. Not just a story. But a pattern. A voice moving beneath the noise, between the lines of our lives. This isn’t just a killer. This is something else. Something… calculated. I call him The Whisperer.”

His fingers swept across the desk, papers fanned out in controlled chaos—autopsy reports, newspaper clippings, police transcripts, and faded photocopies. Names that had once been just cases were now connected like lines in a song. Regina McClain, Madison Rios, Deborah Ann King, Jessica Nguyen, Mia Bell, Eric Lane And before them Emily Monroe, Natasha Lane, Ashley...

“Every year since 2018, someone has died under nearly identical circumstances—public setting, single gunshot, minimal evidence, no motive, and always… always… a message.”

David reached for the printed notes, one by one, his voice steady as he read:
""He hears you""
“Paint me in silence""
""The Echo That Bled""
""Echoes don’t lie""
""Your voice woke me""
""The Voice That Died""
And from the past...
""Whispers carry farther than screams""


“These are not random words. They’re verses. And together, they build a voice—a voice trying to be heard.”

David paused the recording, hand frozen above a file he hadn’t touched in months: Cassandra Serna. His mother.

He hesitated, then opened it.

A chill ran through him.

He'd looked through the file a hundred times before, but something—something about the other notes—had reoriented his mind. He scanned her crime scene photos again. The autopsy report. The inventory list.

Then he saw it.

A battered hardback of her and his favorite BOOK strange ritual from childhood. It had been cataloged, but dismissed by police as unrelated. But now, David noticed something else. In the inside cover, written in delicate but deliberate hand:

“She recite to him. I listened, too.”

He blinked.

“No…”

It had never stood out before. It was too small, too vague. It hadn’t even made it into the official report summary. But now—it screamed.

It matched. Not just in tone. In style. In ritual.

His mother hadn’t been the first episode. She had been the origin.

He hit record again, voice low, shaking:

“My mother, Cassandra Serna, was killed in 1994. She is the reason I started this podcast. But maybe… maybe it’s the reason he did. Because she wasn’t just a victim. She might’ve been his first.”

His voice cracked but didn’t break.

“I’ve been chasing him without realizing he started with me.”

He finished the episode in one breathless hour, every word more urgent than the last. The story twisted together, and by the time he hit upload, the city outside his window was beginning to wake.

By noon, it was everywhere.

Local news latched on first. Headlines blinked across the web:

UNHEARD NO MORE: PODCASTER CLAIMS SERIAL KILLER ACTIVE FOR SIX YEARS

‘THE WHISPERER’: AUDIO JOURNALIST CONNECTS UNSOLVED MURDERS

IS THERE A SERIAL KILLER IN DALLAS?

David didn’t check his messages. His inbox was already swamped. Journalists, listeners, anonymous names with half-whispered tips.

The dam had broken.

At police station

Sam was in the evidence room when Torres found him.

""Hey,"" she said, stepping into the doorway. ""You need to hear something.""

Sam didn’t look up from the folder he was flipping through. “What is it?”

“You ever listen to Unheard Voices?”

He finally glanced at her. “The podcast? Yeah. Couple episodes.”

“Well, you’re gonna want to listen to the new one.” She slide her phone thru the table, the episode already queued. “It dropped a few hours ago. It’s… about our case.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean, our case?”

Torres nodded toward the phone. “Hit play.”

He did.

The first words froze him in place.

“I call him The Whisperer.”

Sam sat down, silent.

The voice was calm, practiced. But the content? Explosive. The episode covered everything—victim timelines, matching methods, the cryptic messages—and then it went deeper. Names, counties, years.

And then… Cassandra Serna.

His eyes narrowed.

“My mother…”

He rewound that part and listened again.

The podcaster wasn’t just a random conspiracy guy. He was personally connected.

Sam turned to Torres. “Who the hell is this guy?”

She shook her head. “We’re looking. Nothing public. Just a name. David Serna.”

“Get his file. Everything he’s posted. Every episode. I want a list of every case he’s touched.”

Torres nodded. “Already on it.”

Sam leaned back, the chill creeping up his spine. Whoever this guy was he had just done what the police hadn’t. He hadn’t solved it. But he’d lit a match.

And now the whole city was watching the flame.

The Echo

He was seated in the back of a corner café when he pressed play.

Headphones in. Hood up. A cup of coffee untouched.

He listened, expression still, eyes lowered to the tabletop.

The voice came through.

“I call him The Whisperer.”

A small smile formed.

“He’s left messages in every murder each one building on the last, like notes in a score…”

He tilted his head, listening not just to the words, but to the tone. To the fear beneath them. The awe.

But then the reveal.

“Cassandra Serna... my mother…”

The smile faded.

He remember her.

(Flashback)

Cassandra.

The last time he saw her.

It was late summer of '94.

They had met at a gallery. She was standing still in front of a Rothko paint and whispered, “This reminds me of insomnia.” Then turned to him, a smile curling at the edges of her voice. “Not deep. Just true.”

He asked her out. She agreed.

He’d picked her up for dinner, something casual. She opened the door wearing denim and soft laughter, the kind that settled into a room without asking permission.

He remembered the house modest, warm, humming with old music and the scent of lavender.

And the boy.

David.

Eight, maybe nine. Big eyes, dark hair, holding ""the book"" too large for his lap. the stereo behind him, something played a delicate orchestral swell, strings dancing just above a piano line. Not pop. Not jazz. Classical.

It surprised him.

“This is David,” she’d said with that quiet pride. “My son.”

The boy looked up at him, unreadable, curious—but cautious. He nodded, didn’t smile.

He knelt to meet him eye to eye.

“Hey there,” the Whisperer had said softly, something gentle in his voice he hadn’t known he could still find. “You like stories?”

David had nodded, then pointed toward the speakers without saying a word.

“And music,” Cassandra added, brushing a hand through her son’s hair. “Mostly classical. He’s obsessed with symphonies. Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, even Mahler. He says it helps him see the books in his head.”

""it's that right?"" The Whisperer replied looking to him.

The boy said. “Mama says symphonies are like stories without words.”

“And do you believe her?”

The boy nodded. “She doesn’t lie.”

The Whisperer hadn’t understood the weight of that moment until now.

He glanced at the stereo. The movement rising. A tension building, then breaking.

It wasn’t just music.

It was a narrative without words.

David looked back at the book, flipping a page with quiet purpose, the music swelling behind him.

The Echo remembered the way the two things sound and story folded into each other in that small room.

He hadn’t planned it back then. Not yet.

But something inside him had already started to shift.

the date itself was remarkable, until it wasn’t.

Wine, pasta, conversation that dipped and returned like waves under cloud lights. She spoke about poetry, myths, grief. She talked about silence as though it were a country she’d once lived in.

He didn’t feel love, not the way people imagined it. But interest. Curiosity. And Cassandra she had mystery. She wasn’t like the others. She didn’t fear silence. She moved inside it.

But as the night wore on, something in her changed.

Not suddenly. Gradually.

Her eyes grew quieter. Her body stiffer. Her laugh lost its echo.

It was during dessert, chocolate and strawberries and a shared glass of cabernet; when she looked at him as if something had peeled away.

A layer she hadn’t seen before. Or hadn’t wanted to.

She didn’t say anything in the moment. Not directly.

The night ended normally. A polite goodbye. No invitation inside. Just a hand on the doorknob and a long silence between them.

But in that silence, she looked him in the eye and said:

""You carry something within you""

He stare quietly.

She added, with a faint shake of her head, “But I don’t want it near my son and I think we’re too different. Thank you for the evening. Take care.”

And with that, she gently closed the door.

Remembered the echo of her words like they were meant for who he truly was.

Weeks passed.

And then he found her again.

Not at home. Not with her son nearby. Somewhere quieter. Somewhere no one would look.

She hadn’t screamed.

She just looked at him and said:

“I knew you’d come back.”

And when she fell, The something slipped from her bag.

A book she always carried.

He opened the cover and wrote inside it, not for her.

For the boy.

“She recite to him. I listened, too.”

He leaned back slowly as the episode continued, hearing the story of himself told by the boy.

Not The Whisperer. Not to him.

He didn’t call himself that.

No, he had always saw himself as…

Chapter 10: Echoes in the Blood

Sam

The Station was buzzing.

The murder of Eric Lane had already stirred tension. But now—with that podcast episode going viral—the pressure had turned suffocating. Calls were coming down from city officials, federal agencies were sniffing around, and the press circled like sharks. This wasn’t just a murder anymore.

It was a pattern. A voice. A myth in the making.

Sam stood in front of the case board, red string connecting six photos. Four recent victims. and the ones from the ‘90s. And in the center: a note card, pinned in thick black ink—

“The Whisperer?”

He muttered under his breath. “Still don’t like that name.”

Torres stepped in, holding fresh stills. “Got something. Surveillance footage from a liquor store across the street from the alley where Eric Lane died.”

She dropped them on the table.

A shape. No face. But a presence.

A tall figure. Long coat. Hood drawn. The silhouette hovered near the edge of the crowd. Never looked at the camera. Barely moved. Like a shadow waiting for its cue.

Sam exhaled slowly. “He was there.”

“We ran it through recognition software,” Torres said. “No matches. But the time stamp checks out. He was there before we arrived. He watched us.”

Sam stared at the blurry image longer than necessary.

Then: “He makes mistakes when he wants to be seen.”

Torres raised a brow. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“He’s sending a message. Not just with the victims. With his presence. He doesn’t just kill. He performs. He wants an audience.”

Torres hesitated. “And David? The podcaster?”

Sam rubbed the back of his neck. “We’ve traced the podcast to an LLC registered out of state. Clean. Too clean. No socials. No address. He’s covering his tracks, but we’ll find him.”

“You think he’s involved?”

“No,” Sam said. Then, quieter: “But he’s inside this. Deep. If he’s right about his mother... this started long before we noticed. And he’s not just telling the story anymore—he’s part of it.”

David

The sun had set an hour ago, but David hadn’t noticed.

It hit him differently tonight. Not as evidence. But as memory.

It wasn’t just a cryptic phrase.

It was... personal.

The killer had written it for someone. Not the cops. Not the world.

For him.

He could see flashes now—his mother’s voice reading aloud, soft and low. His own head resting in her lap, a book open under the dim yellow lamp. And maybe—just maybe—a stranger once sitting too quietly nearby. Watching. Listening.

His stomach turned.

The killer wasn’t announcing himself back then.

He was... remembering.

David turned slowly to his mic. His hand hovered.

Then he pressed record.

His voice was quieter than usual. No introduction. No drama. Just truth.

“My mother wasn’t just the first victim. She was the first verse. The first name in a pattern I didn’t understand until now. And someone has been listening to me since before I ever spoke into this mic.”

He exhaled.

“He was there. Not just in the alley. Not just in the case files. In my life. I think I met him. Once. I just don’t remember well.”

The Whisperer

He stood in the alley where Eric Lane had died.

No one expected him to return. Not this soon. Not while the yellow tape still fluttered like dead ribbon. Not while the scent of bleach and blood clung to the bricks.

But this place—like so many before—was part of the performance.

A verse.

They called him many names now. The Whisperer. The Speaker. The Killer in Silence.

But none of them knew the truth.

He wasn’t telling a story.

He was finishing one.

He pulled a small slip of paper from his coat and unfolded it. A phrase already written. Measured. Clean. A whisper caught in ink:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

He left the paper where the body of Eric laid, then slipped on his headphones.

The podcast played again.

He wasn’t sure why he kept listening. Maybe to feel seen. Or maybe to see how much David had remembered.

And tonight… he had remembered too much.

The Keeper smiled faintly as the alley swallowed him again.

The echo was growing louder.

And the boy was finally listening.

1mfzu4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1mfzu4k/todays_spiral_was_about_granola_boys_lol/,"Today's spiral was about granola boys, lol.","I spiralled today because I saw a friend of mine get into a new relationship with a 'granola boy' which is literally my perfect type of guy. He dresses in vintage clothes, loves hikes and works in nature for a living. Perfect, calming lifestyle that's very much appealing to me.

It made me spiral because I love my partner, but he is not this. He wears merch from his favourite band - kinda grunge/gothic. He doesn't take pride in his style. He will go on a hike if it's a family outing but not necessarily off his own back and he's a tech-boy.. chronically glued to nerdy games on his PC (can be super cute to watch him nerd over them).. and works with computers for a living.

I think because I love nature and I wanna be more outdoorsy, meeting someone with that lifestyle already would encourage me to live like that? Perhaps it's a projection of the fact I'm not living the life I want for myself and I'm blaming my partner? I'm not sure.

And this spans into my partners lack of adventure. We nearly had a breakup talk today. It was honest and raw. He said I have to prioritise my happiness and that he likely won't gain passion or an adventurous spirit out of nowhere. But then again said alot of it is tied to finances and him having very little. We both got upset and voiced we didn't want to watch each other move on with someone knew, but if it came to that, it came to that. 

I know if we broke up it would be super amicable but I'd be heartbroken. The things I'm fixating on are literally just preferences, and by saying 'I love him'... I SHOULD love him for HIM and not what I wish he was as well as what he is.

I've met 'outdoorsy granola' men before and they were either really horrible, really dry in personality or they lived off daddy's money - none of which I'm interested in. I guess it's just hard to know if these worries will ever go away or if they're genuinely worthy of ending a relationship. We'll never know I guess. I have two introductory sessions with two therapists in two days - I'll see which I can afford and which is better for me.

What makes it a little worse is over this flare-up for the past few months, it's almost like I've forgotten who I fell in love with or what things we like to do as a couple. He works alot, I spend alot of time alone. I take myself on dates and out with friends. He comes home and is normally exhausted. He's glued to his phone alot when he's a little braindead after a busy day but it does bug me. He's always playing a mobile game alongside his PC games and watching a show. Sometimes I even think we don't have much to talk about when we go out for dinner or a coffee - or perhaps I overthink it.

Ughhh I don't know anymore. I'm exhausted and want to be left alone. He doesn't deserve any of this - he deserves love. And although I try show him this consistently besides everything, this alone, would honestly be enough to encourage me to leave him so he can finally be truly happy :(",1,1754164963.0,ROCD,0,1.0,False

I was halfway through my morning coffee when this idea hit: What if our digital gifts just got...smarter? Like, **AI, but with presents**?? 

So here’s me, trying to wrap my brain around it:  
- Is it a regular gift card powered by AI?  
- Or does it mean you get a magical code and the AI does something WILD with it?  
- Does the AI pick the gift?  
- Can I finally avoid embarrassing gift fails because *GENIUS ROBOT* knows what my cousin in Canada wants?  

I mean – imagine getting an *AI-powered* gift experience where you just hand someone a code, and then (like magic!), the AI chats with them, learns what they love, and voila—THE PERFECT GIFT. Every time. No socks. No scented candles. No more, “Oh, you shouldn’t have (but please keep the receipt).”

https://goodnovel.org/

But—is this brilliant or kinda scary? Are we giving up the personal touch? If the AI starts analyzing my buying history and my questionable midnight snack orders (“Yes, AI, I did buy 48 doughnuts last week, don't judge me!”), is that a win for luxury gifting, or are we heading into robot overlord territory?

Hey, maybe AI gift cards could do ALL this:  
- Personalize e-book or audiobook picks (I’d love for a machine to suggest my next romance or thriller—shoutout to my fellow bookworms!)  
- Recommend the best gourmet chocolate, fancy skincare, or luxury pajamas, all based on *actual* preferences  
- Even curate experiences—spa days, trips, exclusive subscriptions!  

Can you imagine the conversations?  
Friend: “How did you KNOW I’d love Himalayan salted caramel truffles?”  
Me: “Ummm… my *robot friend* knew.”  
  
With AI, even the most indecisive among us could look like gifting all-stars.

But so many questions!  
- Can you customize how much AI “helps” vs. “creeps you out”?  
- Are we just making lazier choices with tech, or does this actually show we care MORE, because each choice is tailored?  
- And, big one—would you TRUST an AI, or is your instinct still to pick out presents by hand?  

https://goodnovel.org/

Part of me hopes this leads to a future of *zero* awkward family gift exchanges. But part of me wonders what I’d miss if I stopped overthinking and overanalyzing the “perfect” gift for every birthday, anniversary, or major holiday.

Has anyone here tried an AI gift card? Did you love it? Was it weirdly accurate? Or hilariously off-base?

1mfzoq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mfzoq7/should_you_buy_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K155,"Testing out the Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial coffee maker has been an interesting experience. I've used it nearly every day for both personal cups of coffee and office settings, and it delivers a stellar combination of convenience and functionality. With its striking silver metallic finish and thoughtfully modern design, it doesn’t just sit on the counter; it shines. One of the standout features is its ability to brew multiple beverages — coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and even iced drinks — making it an all-rounder for various preferences. This versatility is perfect for environments with diverse tastes where options are key.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Keurig K155 Office Pro is styled for efficiency and elegance. Its compact design, with dimensions of 10.38 inches deep, 14 inches wide, and 13.8 inches high, fits perfectly on smaller countertops while still complementing modern interiors. The metallic silver finish adds a professional aesthetic that blends well in office conference rooms or premium kitchens. It’s also impressively sturdy with its 6-pound build, ensuring it doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap when you use it. The removable tank and sleek touchscreen interface make usability and maintenance intuitive. Honestly, every detail feels refined, from the user interface to its durable parts.

**Operation and Settings**  
The operational simplicity of this machine is outstanding. With a fully automatic mode and a full-color touchscreen, configuring brew settings has never been easier. The screen allows customization of brew temperature and includes an auto on/off timer — super handy for busy individuals who might forget to switch it off. I personally appreciated the multilingual settings; whether you speak English, Spanish, or French, setting it up is remarkably straightforward. For someone who loves experimenting, adjusting brew temperatures to find that perfect flavor was both fun and rewarding.

**Good Aspects**  
- The 90 oz. removable water reservoir is a game changer. With the ability to brew 18 cups before needing a refill, it’s fantastic for higher usage settings like small offices or households with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- Four brew size options (4 oz., 6 oz., 8 oz., and 10 oz.) cater brilliantly to individual preferences. Whether I wanted a quick shot of coffee or a filling travel mug for a busy morning, it handled everything.  
- The ease of draining and storing water from the internal tank adds a level of practicality for anyone needing to transport this coffee maker.  
- Touchscreen controls are easy to navigate and truly elevate the product’s usability.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Despite its perks, the Keurig K155 isn’t a completely silent machine. While the brewing process isn’t horribly noisy, it may still disrupt quiet environments.  
- The inability to brew coffee stronger than the preset maximum left me slightly disappointed when trying to increase the intensity.  
- It doesn’t come with any eco-friendly reusable K-cups or filters, requiring an additional purchase if sustainability matters to you.  
- Although it performs well for coffee aficionados, individuals seeking robust espresso-style beverages might find it underwhelming.

Check [Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial] price on Amazon.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
This machine is everything you’d want in a high-end single-serve brewer when it comes to performance. Each cup is brewed in under a minute, maintaining consistent temperatures and flavors. I experimented with several brands of pods, and the results were consistently smooth. The four brew-size options cater to varied needs, which I found especially handy during office meetings where colleagues preferred different portion sizes. While it doesn’t deliver barista-style espresso drinks, it certainly handles standard coffees and teas with finesse. Plus, iced beverages brewed flawlessly, offering another delightful layer of versatility.

**Challengers in the Market**  
Looking at competing brewing systems, the Cuisinart SS-10 comes to mind. It offers similar features like multiple brewing sizes and a removable reservoir but lacks the premium touchscreen Keurig has integrated. While the SS-10 allows greater customization with reusable filters included, its interface feels slightly dated in comparison. On the other hand, a higher-end competitor like the Nespresso VertuoLine specializes in robust espresso drinks with its centrifusion technology. However, the Nespresso lacks the beverage versatility provided by this Keurig model, especially when considering tea or iced options. For general use and varied beverages, the Keurig K155 holds a solid edge.

**Money's Worth**  
Is this coffee maker worth it? For settings like small offices or kitchens where multiple people have unique preferences, I’d argue yes. The large reservoir and intuitive features save loads of time, and the overall build quality feels well-thought-out for its price range. While paying for pods may add up over time compared to regular coffee brewing methods, the convenience and speed offered here undeniably offset that.

- Michigan, Zone 6a, mid-summer weather (more cloudy, humid, some days of full heat and sun)
- The plants include peonies, roses, hydrangeas, clematis, hostas, some herbs like lovage.


I am new to landscaping - I have been using this corner area in my backyard as a parking lot for the plants I moved from the front of my house. I was hoping to create a small and private haven to drink coffee in the morning and read back here, but my lilac shrub in the corner has started to die, which is prompting me to remove it and put something new there before winter rolls around. With this, I am planning to rearrange the layout of the floral plants - peonies, hydrangeas, roses - but I'm not sure if moving them all around would shock and kill the plants. Would they die? Specifically my peonies...

I'd like to possibly create a hedge along the fence using my hydrangeas, or put up a cedar fence back here...

I'm currently a few weeks into my increased dose of Zoloft (50mg) and so far I feel great for the most part! With this increase, I'm also taking a very low dose of Ritalin to help with my ADHD symptoms. 

Now, I've had ADHD for over 20 years and was taking Adderall as needed to help when I needed to focus in school and work. When I was starting off on Zoloft, I was told to take my Adderall everyday rather than as needed. I did this for a week 3 times within the past few months and eventually would have a panic attacks after a week of taking the Adderall everyday. May I mind you, this was a low dose I was taking. I also drank a cup of coffee everyday during those weeks, which I'm sure didnt help. 

I would tell my Psychologist about this and she would say Im 'sensitive' when it comes to medications and i should try Ritalin instead of Adderall while still being on the Zoloft. Everytime I mention this to my therapist, he always looks disappointed. I told him during our last session I wanted to start taking ADHD meds so I can slowly get off the Zoloft and be on that instead, which he understood.

My question is, for those who have taken ADHD medication with Zoloft, has these panic attacks happened to you? Do you think Ritalin would be better than Adderall when it comes to taking the Zoloft? ",1,1754164479.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False

I left the test defeated feeling like I failed but the score came back at 876. The ungraded questions might have broken my spirit a bit but I just kept going through each question without letting them deter me during the exam. 



Here was what I did just in case it helps you:  
**During exam:**  
Read last sentences first if it's a long question. Look to see what its looking for. MOST dev friendly. LOWEST operational overhead. etc. I gave that additional weight. Then they will tell you 'the company wants to for example save money and use managed services', give that extremely high weight but slightly lower weight than the final sentence is what I did.  Once in a while I would look at the answers but just look at a few keywords, what are they giving me? Are they giving me DB answers, networking answers, etc. Keep that in mind and read the question. Reread the question often with an objective of picking up specific wants. Shorten each paragraph or section into key asks to maintain focus.  
  
**Prep day of and night before the exam:**  
\-I know I'm lactose intolerant and heavy oily foods slow me down the next day. Ate steamed salmon, some veggies, and lactose free milk cereal. Only reviewed my weak spots a bit with bullet points and only a few questions of practice exams. Let my mind chill out a bit. No caffeine after 10am so I have a better shot at sleeping. Ran all the system checks and rebooted the PC.

\-Day of exam woke up a bit earlier and took the dog for a walk, started hydrating as soon as I woke up and added a little bit of salt for electrolytes. Had a cup of coffee right before the walk. After we were done with the walk I did a few jogs/runs up and down the hills to ensure I had 20 minutes of elevated heart rate and extra oxygen to the brain to keep me going. From my days of card counting I knew I had about a 3 hour elevated focus window from that exercise.

\-Rehydrated and went to the restroom 2x even if I didnt need to. Got a new cup of water, coffee, and although I don't do soda got a cup of ice and a coca cola for the caffeine and refreshment. Logged on 30 mins early to finish the proctoring and started the exam at 9:15am. Booked a morning time since I know I am fresher in the mornings and all my practice exams began at 7 or 8am so it was in line with my practices.

  
**Leading up to the exam:**  
Practice exams every single day, moving up to 3 hours of focused no interruption practice test taking and doing at least 4-5 of those before the real exam. 

Prior to those I would have very low focus. At the beginning focusing for 15 mins was an achievement. Worked it up to an hour, an hour and a half then 2 hours and finally 3 hours.  Finally made myself do 3.5 hours just to make it harder than the real exam.

For practice exams I used every source I can find on this thread and asking friends at AWS what they use. Everyone liked TutorialDojo and it had good explanations. I found working with ChatGPT as a tutor helped a lot but BE WARNED: You Absolutely must review the answers against official docs and also use the google search engine AI to find official sources. It \*WILL\* Hallucinate and give you wrong answers often enough, be thorough this is not the exam to get lazy on as nuance matters.  Take the practice exams, go through tutorialsdojo in review mode, see if you got it right, mark what you got wrong and also any questions you have in 2 seconds (wrong and questions). Review each one of those with ChatGPT then find official sources to validate. 

I did this for 6 weeks. Very little hands on experience with AWS but very familiar with some concepts like cost explorer and things like that.

  
Thank you everyone for sharing your experiences on here it helped motivate me to keep going!

M however decided randomly that he doesn't like living with me and never wants to live with me again, even though he is my best friend and there's nobody I'm closer with. He waited until really late in the year to tell me he already sorted housing without me, and gave me no time or warning to figure something out.

I have ended up meeting random people on the uni facebook, went to coffee with them once and decided I'd live with them, so complete strangers and I am terrified.

1. Vegueros Centrofino - light brown sugar, chocolatey raisins, and some faint white pepper make this a pretty good medium strength Cuban
2. Regius Grandido - a true Cuban Churchill size (7x47), I really like this cigar. Sweet oats, dark chocolate, and a red pepper retrohale. Not as much space as I was expecting. Solid medium strength, full flavor though.
3. Davidoff Nicaragua Diadema - clearly, I’m not a Davidoff guy. I was expecting us to have some Nicaraguan spice and earth and something that told me why these are $30 cigars. *Meh.* that’s disappointing to me because I just bought five Davidoff Late Hour  Churchills. I’m now not expecting much…
4. The Lion’s Den The Bridge - I picked this up from a local cigar lounge and it was leaps and bounds better than the Davidoff. Made from both Nicaraguan tobacco and tobacco from Virginia, coffee, earth, sweet cocoa powder, and a nice bread background made this a pretty awesome cigar. 
5. Exitoso Habano robusto (I believe) - another local cigar maker following their dreams, putting out super flavorful cigars (at least this one anyway!). Dark stone fruit sweetness (think dark cherries), dried raisins and coffee were most prevelant to me. A solid medium strength cigar, this stick burned awesomely, even with the crap humidity we’ve been having. I’ll be buying more of these!
6. My Father Fonseca Toro Gordo - without a doubt, my most favorite My Father cigar. Dark molasses, earth, dried wood, heavy pepper and a nice amount of cashew nuttiness make this an “always buy” for me. I’ll take this over The Judge *any and every day.*

9am: walk and morning coffee with fiancé, private breakfast with personal vows 

10-11am either chill or help with decorating, personally I have no problem doing this but we will probably get a day-of coordinator to handle that 

11am start getting ready, I’m going my own hair and makeup 

2pm first look and couples photos (originally I didn’t want a first look but now am planning it to get some jitters out and be able to spend more time with guests afterwards) 

230pm family photos, is an hour enough time? 

330-430 welcome hour with apps and cocktails so people can mingle while I freshen up from pictures. The venue is BYOB so we’ll just do non alcoholic options, beer, wine and a signature batched drink 

5pm ceremony. No bridal party, traditional vows 

530-630 cocktail hour with more apps, is a second one too much? I kinda like it and we can make our entrance then. 

630-730 dinner (we’re doing buffet style) hopefully by entering during the cocktail hour we can have time to say hi to people and then actually get to eat dinner lol 

730-10pm reception. My family loves to dance so I want max time here 😎

Just reaching out for some feedback on a few questions. I understand that a lot of this is subjective, and you can’t please everybody, but hear me out and know I’m not trying to but I also want to make a good showing and I’m trying to discover my “core” image of that makes sense.

I’ve been making candles on and off as a hobby for about 2 years. And a family friend who owns 2 popular farms reached out to pick up a fall line of candles which I’m absolutely pumped about. I’m planning 3 scents all in a 12oz and 5oz size.

I’ve ordered the vessels, my wax (coconut apricot from CS), my wicks, and just about everything I believe I’ll need other than the FOs as I’m still testing smells out of 1oz bottles on blotter strips before I buy larger sizes.

For my fall line I’m planning to create 3 scents, these are the images I’m hoping to evoke:


1) a morning coffee on a crisp morning (iced gingersnap, snickerdoodle, coffee shop)

2) Baking with the smell of autumn coming through the windows (cinnamon vanilla, sweet caramel vanilla, almond macaroon, alpine balsam)

3)Crisp, relaxing autumn night (Fignilla, sweet tobacco, oak moss and amber) *this one I’m still fine tuning*

One of my favorite things about candle making is custom blending, finding new, unique smells, but I can get carried away, actually..,,i definitely get carried away lol.

My wife and I recently had a baby sprinkle for our 2nd baby where I let some of the ladies smell blotter strips of some of the blends above. Overall positive feedback but to sum up overall feedback many liked smells of just one FO on its own, not blended. Which made me think maybe IM GETTING CARRIED AWAY…

So my questions are this:
1) have any of you found that instead of blending, you have better success in just using appointed oils on their own to create your candles? I’m trying to avoid having my fall lineup just smell like a run of the mill pumpkin cinnamon candle, but it is a favorite for a reason I guess.

2) I’m finding in my 12oz, all expenses considered it’ll cost me roughly $11 to make 1…I’m just starting out so I wasn’t able to buy in large bulk quantities. Most candle makers say try to charge 3-4x your expense, does $35 seems unrealistic for a 12oz candle. My wife says yes but I remind her this isn’t Marshall’s lol.
*note: clientele is mainly upper middle/upper x
Class who shops here*

3) My night scent I keep working with keeps having a masculine scent to it. My wife keeps telling me clientele won’t jump at it (she assures me she is my clientele lol) and while she really is a huge supporter, I think some women like those kind of smells but this come back to not being able to please everyone.

Any other tips or criticism greatly appreciated!!

Thanks for reading my novel and good luck to everyone out there.

The use of high-grade stainless steel not only ensures the grinder's durability but also contributes to its hygienic operation. Unlike plastic or other materials, stainless steel is non-porous, making it resistant to bacteria growth and easy to clean.

**Grinding Mechanism and Precision:** The grinding mechanism varies among models, with options including burr grinders, blade grinders, and mortar-and-pestle style grinders. The precision of the grind is crucial for achieving the desired consistency and flavor. Burr grinders, in particular, offer exceptional precision, allowing users to select from a wide range of grind settings, from coarse to fine. The burrs are typically made from hardened stainless steel or ceramic, ensuring uniform grinding and minimizing heat buildup.Innovative designs focus on minimizing friction and heat generation during the grinding process, preserving the flavor and aroma of the ingredients being ground.

**Motor Power and Efficiency:** the motor power directly impacts the grinder's ability to process tough ingredients and maintain consistent speed. High-end models feature powerful motors, typically ranging from 150 to 300 watts, that can effortlessly grind spices, nuts, coffee beans, and even seeds. These motors are designed for efficient operation, minimizing energy consumption while delivering optimal performance.

An efficient motor not only ensures consistent grinding but also contributes to the grinder's longevity. By reducing strain on the motor, manufacturers can extend its lifespan and minimize the risk of overheating or failure.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** Stainless steel grinders are renowned for their ease of cleaning and maintenance. Most models feature removable grinding chambers and blades that can be easily washed by hand or in a dishwasher. The smooth, non-porous surface of stainless steel prevents food particles from sticking, simplifying the cleaning process and ensuring hygienic operation.

Regular maintenance, such as cleaning the grinding chamber after each use, further prolongs the grinder's lifespan and ensures optimal performance. Some models also include self-cleaning functions to simplify maintenance.

**Safety Features:** Safety is a paramount concern in grinder design. Top-rated models incorporate safety features such as overload protection, which automatically shuts off the motor if its subjected to excessive strain. They also feature secure locking mechanisms to prevent accidental operation and non-slip bases to ensure stability during use.

These safety features protect both the user and the grinder, preventing accidents and prolonging the lifespan of the appliance.

## Core Benefits

Stainless steel grinders offer a multitude of benefits that make them a valuable addition to any kitchen. These benefits extend beyond mere functionality, encompassing improved performance, enhanced convenience, and long-term cost savings.

**Superior Grinding Performance:** Stainless steel grinders excel at consistently producing uniform grinds due to their robust construction and precise grinding mechanisms. This consistent grind optimizes flavor extraction whether you're grinding coffee,spices,or herbs,resulting in a richer,more flavorful end product. for example, a consistent coffee grind ensures even saturation and extraction during brewing, eliminating bitter or weak spots.

This consistency translates to improved culinary results,allowing for more precise control over the flavor profile of dishes.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:** Stainless steel is inherently more durable than other materials commonly used in grinders, such as plastic or aluminum. This durability translates into a longer lifespan of the appliance, making it a worthwhile investment. Unlike plastic grinders which may crack or wear down over time, stainless steel grinders can withstand years of heavy use.

Users can expect a substantially longer lifespan from a stainless steel grinder, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Improved Hygiene and Safety:** Stainless steel's non-porous nature makes it highly resistant to bacteria growth and easy to clean. This is particularly important for grinders used to process food, as it minimizes the risk of contamination. The easy-to-clean surface prevents food particles from accumulating, further enhancing hygiene.

The hygienic properties of stainless steel grinders make them a safe and reliable choice for food planning.

**Versatile Request:** Stainless steel grinders are incredibly versatile, capable of grinding a wide range of ingredients, from coffee beans and spices to nuts, seeds, and herbs. This versatility eliminates the need for multiple specialized grinders,saving space and simplifying kitchen operations. Some models even offer attachments for grinding meat or vegetables.

The versatility of stainless steel grinders makes them a valuable all-in-one tool for various culinary tasks.**Aesthetic Appeal:** Stainless steel grinders often feature a sleek, modern design that complements any kitchen décor. The polished finish and clean lines add a touch of elegance to the countertop. The visual appeal of stainless steel grinders enhances the overall aesthetic of the kitchen.

Cleaning a stainless steel grinder is usually straightforward. Unplug the grinder and disassemble any removable parts, such as the grinding chamber and blades. Wash these parts with warm soapy water, rinse thoroughly, and dry completely before reassembling. The exterior can be wiped down with a damp cloth. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the stainless steel.

Regular cleaning after each use will prevent buildup and ensure optimal performance. Some models have dishwasher-safe components; check the manufacturer's instructions.

**Are stainless steel grinders better than grinders made of other materials?**
Yes,stainless steel grinders offer several advantages over grinders made of plastic or aluminum. Stainless steel is more durable, resistant to corrosion, and easier to clean. It's also non-reactive, meaning it won't impart any unwanted flavors or odors to the ground ingredients. Plastic grinders can degrade over time and retain odors, while aluminum grinders can be susceptible to corrosion.The improved durability, hygiene and neutrality of stainless steel makes it a superior material for grinders.

**What should I look for in a high-quality stainless steel grinder?**
When selecting a high-quality stainless steel grinder, consider factors like the quality of the stainless steel (food-grade 304 is ideal), the power of the motor, the type of grinding mechanism (burr grinders offer greater precision), the ease of cleaning, and any safety features. A reputable brand with positive customer reviews is also a good indicator of quality. Check for clear markings of the grade of stainless steel used.

Prioritizing these factors will help you choose a stainless steel grinder that meets your specific needs and provides long-lasting performance.

1mfzcec,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1mfzcec/does_arm_hammer_natural_detergent_booster_truly/,Does Arm & Hammer Natural Detergent Booster truly improve laundry cleanliness? Review inside!,"The **Arm & Hammer Natural Detergent Booster and Household Cleaner (B01MQDCATU)** is one of those products that snuck into my daily routine almost seamlessly. With its many claims of cleaner, brighter laundry and the ability to eliminate household odors naturally, I decided to give it a whirl. After a few weeks of solid testing, my experience with this powdered detergent booster has been an interesting mix of sparkling successes and a handful of noteworthy challenges.

**Design and Packaging**  
Let’s start with the packaging here. This comes in a classic cardboard box with the signature Arm & Hammer branding—nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done. The instructions are clear, and you can easily measure out the powder without ending up with a mess (assuming you don’t get overzealous, like I did once or twice). At a weight of 55 ounces, it’s compact enough for storage, which is helpful if your laundry area is more ""tiny nook"" than ""palatial suite.""

**Key Benefits**  
In terms of performance, this booster has genuinely impressed me. I’ve used it with liquid laundry detergent to tackle everything from everyday grime to those dreaded coffee stains my coworker insists on spilling. Here’s what stood out:  
- Truly enhances the cleaning power of everyday detergents.  
- Works wonders for removing stubborn stains like mustard.  
- Completely free of fragrances and phosphates, making it a gentle choice for all skin types.  

Those are some solid green flags, especially if you’re someone who values products that are both effective and environment-conscious.

[Check Arm & Hammer Natural Detergent Booster and Household Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b01mqdcatu/)  

**Performance in Laundry and Beyond**  
Adding this powder to my laundry load was a piece of cake—a couple of tablespoons dissolved beautifully in warm water, and there was no residue left behind on the clothes. The claim of ""whiter, brighter laundry"" is spot-on. My older white shirts looked much better after two washes, which, let me tell you, is sorcery in the laundry world. Apart from laundry, it also holds up as a multipurpose cleaner. I tackled my grimy bathroom sink with a bit of the powder mixed with warm water, and the result was gleaming surfaces that screamed, ""I’m clean!""

**Shortcomings**  
Like most honest reviews on the internet, I’d be remiss not to mention some hurdles with this product.  
- It doesn’t dissolve as effectively in cold water, leaving some clumps in the machine.  
- The packaging isn’t resealable, so unless you use a clip or transfer it to another container, there’s a risk of moisture getting in.  
- For outdoor hard surfaces, it was slightly underwhelming compared to specialized outdoor cleaners.  

These aren’t deal breakers but worth considering if you’re a fan of cold washes or outdoor cleaning power.

**Fragrance-Free Living**  
A big highlight for me was that this booster is fragrance-free. If you have family members with sensitive noses or skin, you’ll appreciate the absence of artificial scents. My cousin, who has eczema, used some of her clothes washed with this product, and she had zero flare-ups—a rarity for her. This also means you don’t have to worry about any overpowering smells taking over your home.

**Product Rivals**  
When compared to competing brands like OxiClean and Nellie’s All-Natural Oxygen Brightener, this booster has a cost advantage and simplicity going for it. It’s perfect for someone who’s looking for a natural product without added fluff. That said, OxiClean pulls ahead in terms of stain-fighting versatility, especially for outdoor furniture or complex messes. Meanwhile, Nellie's might appeal to those focusing exclusively on eco-friendliness with reusable tins, but it falls slightly behind in raw power.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
This booster embodies quality for its price. While it’s unlikely to break the bank, it provides serious bang for the buck when it comes to tackling tough stains coupled with an overall eco-conscious approach. I say this as a functioning adult who, begrudgingly but wholeheartedly, buys cleaning products for utility and effectiveness. If you want that squeaky-clean satisfaction without regretting a purchase, this is a solid contender.

The article focused a lot on how these spaces are intentionally designed to foster community, but also highlighted the potential for social anxieties and power dynamics.

It's interesting how the design choices can influence interaction. Things like open layouts, communal tables, and even the provision of shared resources like coffee machines are all geared towards encouraging people to mingle. However, the research also suggested that some residents feel pressure to participate, even when they need personal space or are just not feeling social. It brought up concerns about extrovert bias in community design.

Has anyone here lived in a co-living space and experienced this firsthand? Did the lounge feel genuinely communal and welcoming, or did it ever feel forced or performative? I'm especially curious about how co-living spaces addressed potential conflicts arising from shared resources and different expectations of cleanliness or noise levels in these communal areas.",1,1754163667.0,CozyNookCommunity,0,1.0,False

I am honestly exhausted in this dating game, endless swiping on faces in apps, meeting in questionable bars etc. and I am ready to meet my forever person if it's in the cards. No games here! Looking for someone I could grow to genuinely trust who won't flake out. I care more about the substance of the person & want to take care of someone else to the best of my ability in all ways too.

Obviously physical attraction does matter to a degree, but you don't need to be perfect. I just want that person I really click with and hopefully we can enjoy each other's company. Play some video games, have a laugh, or just chit chat. I wish I could be truly excited by someone's presence again. That kind of thing where you can't wait to talk to that person again.

# About me -

I'm an average looking slightly nerdy but masculine guy. I'm 5'8, white, have curly hair, and have an average physique but have started working out a bit. Not fat but not skinny either. I think I look decent. I will be glad to swap pics once we've been chatting for a little while. I am an INTJ / Ambivert. I look pretty young for my age, I get mistaken as someone in their early to mid 20s all the time. Still have all my hair. (lol)

I have a lot of hopes, dreams, and goals. I try my best to be kind and caring. I would say I have a dry sense of humor, and enjoy deep conversations about life that could go anywhere. I'm not a city person but I don't like living in the middle of nowhere either.

I enjoy a variety of different things. I love playing video games even though lately I haven't had time. Doing anything outdoors when the weather is nice calms me and makes me relax. I enjoy hiking trails around here locally.

Road trips, exploring new music (lets swap music?) , reading books, long drives through the countryside with good coffee and conversation, watching movies or shows, and listening to podcasts. If you play certain games, I will gladly play them with you! I'm also open to trying new hobbies with my partner. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too.

I live in a small-ish town here in NC and don't really get the opportunity to meet people outside of work too often due to having a busy week, then being too tired on the weekends but I'd like to change that! I am a sweet guy who just wants that special spark with someone again. I want to meet a girl who will hijack my weekends and prevent me from becoming a workaholic, lol.

Long story short, I want to enjoy quality time together even if it means just voice chatting at first. If you show me that you're worth it, I will make you a priority. Ideally I am not looking for someone too far away from me, but if you're really amazing I will make an exception. I'd like to move somewhere else, as I have grown up in NC and lived here my whole life, although I have traveled around quite a bit.

I have a stable career, college educated, no kids, and in good financial standing / financially responsible with no real debt or criminal record. I work two jobs and have a bachelors degree, and would love to meet someone for 2025. 🫶

🫘 I’ve had fun trying local fresh roasted beans in my area, and also got a bag of freshly roasted Mayorga Cubano from Costco to freeze and try. I also read up on dosing/grinding from frozen and am excited to try that. 

🍯 I welcome and tips or words of advice! I’m only a few weeks in, but pulling decent shots, and making 6oz milk drinks. 16g in 36g out, 28-42 seconds realistically. Any thoughts on how to best incorporate my honey? Is it into the espresso cup before pulling the shot?



— here’s my summary of 3 different setups, in case it’s helpful for other newbies —

🌟 Winner — breville barista pro — 10/10 highly recommend for ease of use and for first time espresso hobbyists. Pros: much nicer grinder than the express, and is a great deal when on sale. It’s also a more substantial feeling machine. It now has an upgraded grinder with baratza burrs which is essentially the baratza encore ESP grinder that is recommended for entry level grinders. It’s a nice machine and easy to use. It looks good in my space, too!

🙅🏼‍♀️ Non-winner — bambino plus + fellow opus. Nice features including auto milk frothing, but feels very cheap, not substantial, and you have to hold and jerk your portafilter in and out of lock position. Every day? No thanks. I tried this with the fellow opus grinder. I didn’t like the coffee grounds coming out of the machine after I pulled out the canister post-grind. Just a no-go combo for me, personally. Look and feel factors into my happiness and daily work flow. 

🤷🏼‍♀️ Alternative option for ease of use — ninja cafe luxe. I know espresso pros may hate on this but I tried it because, well, Costco. It’s really simple, has smart features like recommended grind size, and its milk jug is way heftier than Breville’s and auto frothing capabilities are impressive. I’m still trying this one in comparison to BBP because why not? but it currently doesn’t have any bottomless portafilter options yet.",2,1754163096.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1mfz2vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/fslogix/comments/1mfz2vf/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice,"Hey all, I'm looking for advice as I'm running out of steam on an issue I've been troubleshooting. I'll do my best to be descriptive without writing a novel. I'm burning out and looking to vent/get advice from a crowd that might have different ideas than myself.

  
TL;DR is when fslogix users launch a game such as iRacing the PC reboots and the minidump says it was due to a bug check for an 'invalid\_mdl\_range (0x12e) and the faulting module is mrxsmb20.sys. It specifically failed on the function: smb2write\_start+0x430. Local user accounts don't have the issue.

  
I'm supporting a startup business similar to a gaming cafe but for sim racing. The core idea is that users can come in, use any rig and sign in with their own Steam/iRacing account and carry their bindings and settings from rig to rig (eliminating the arcade and commercial licensing woes). The goal was to provide affordable high-end hardware to people who want to use it instead of building their own for whatever reason.

  
I configured an on-prem AD environment and put Win 11 Enterprise on all the PC's. The file server is a VM running Server 2022 with a local disk hosted on a local datastore on vmWare. I did a pretty basic fslogix setup and everything has been running great for about 10 months. In May I decided to take the PC's up to 24H2 and fslogix 25.04. Initial testing was good and we ran with it. After a few weeks (we had crossed into June at this point) I noticed a random reboot one time. I chalked it up to video games being video games. I checked event viewer and didn't see any app crashes or anything suspicious. I tried to duplicate and couldn't. In the back of my head I thought okay maybe we have a GPU or a PSU starting to let go. 

A couple more times I tried to duplicate the issue but couldn't. Over the next several weeks it started to get worse and more users started having the issue. The PC reboots incredibly fast so you almost don't even notice. It felt more like a sign-out funny enough. 

I started by reverting one of the PC's back to 23H2 but the issue still persisted. I then reverted fslogix back to the previous version we had (can't remember the version off the top of my head but it was from way earlier in the year, possibly even back to Nov/Dec of 2024) and the issue persisted. 

I was able to get the minidumps to finally show the error I put in the TL;DR and I started chasing network stuff. I updated BIOS, tried different chipset and nic drivers, tested cabling, tried a variety of nic tuning items (messing with rss, different offloads, frame sizes, speeds, etc.) to no avail. 

I swapped drives in the esxi host and rebuilt the datastore, built a new file server with the OG server 2022 ISO thinking maybe updates on that caused problems but that didn't solve it either.

I can run a variety of workloads on the roaming profiles without issue. Even profiles up to 50GB in size run fine except for launching these dang games. I want to blame the games but that doesn't really solve the problem, and then I remember that local profiles work fine. 

I rebuilt the 23H2 machine from scratch and brought it up to the latest updates on 24H2 and fslogix 25.06. If I .old a vhdx file from a user and start fresh the user can launch the games, but after a few times of logging out and back in we start seeing the issue.

I have been directing temp folders to the local drive and had the thought, hey maybe these dingbat game developers aren't checking if temp files exist and they're just trying to write to them. That could certainly cause an mdl error, right? I switched up my group policy to not redirect anything to the local drive in hopes the temp files would persist. I verified the keys change in the registry and tested again but still have the same issue. I can duplicate the issue super easily by launching iRacing. It will load enough to download content updates but then crashes the PC after it tries to launch the UI any further. Every single time I get the same minidump that the smb redirector is crashing out do to an mdl error. 

  
Have any of you experienced any type of mdl error or crash while roaming profiles? If you made it this far I owe you coffee or something stronger. Thanks in advance for any thoughts you might share.",1,1754163002.0,fslogix,0,1.0,False
1mfz2qe,https://i.redd.it/1g4dkt07rngf1.png,Why Strong Social Connections Make You a Better Leader (and How to Strengthen Them Without Burning Out),"**TL;DR:**
Leaders with strong social connections are more resilient, creative, and effective—but many don’t realize how crucial relationships are to their performance. This post explores research-backed reasons why social connection matters and offers actionable ways to strengthen relationships both inside and outside of work—without falling into hustle culture or emotional burnout.

---

Most leadership conversations focus on strategy, decision-making, or productivity—but one of the most underrated drivers of effective leadership is *relational intelligence*. The ability to build and sustain meaningful social connections is not just a “nice to have.” It’s foundational to mental health, adaptability, and leadership success.

In my coaching work with leaders and executives, I often see that the turning point in someone's development isn't a new tool or framework—it's a conversation that helped them feel seen, supported, or reconnected to their purpose.

### Why Social Connection Matters for Leadership

Here’s what the research shows:

* **Mental Health & Well-being**: Social connection significantly reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. People with strong social ties are more resilient and experience higher self-esteem. In fact, a landmark study found that lacking social connection is as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010).

* **Cognitive Performance**: Isolation impairs cognitive function, including memory, decision-making, and problem-solving—critical capabilities for any leader.

* **Organizational Impact**: Leaders who foster connection create more engaged teams. Teams with high relational trust and psychological safety generate more creative ideas, navigate conflict more effectively, and sustain high performance over time.

* **Neurodivergent Leaders**: For neurodivergent individuals, authentic connection can be particularly valuable. Shared understanding, acceptance, and community support reduce anxiety and build confidence in navigating professional environments that are often not designed with neurodivergent needs in mind.

### Practical Strategies to Strengthen Your Connections—Without Overcommitting

The goal isn’t to become more “social” in a performative way—it’s to invest in relationships that are energizing, meaningful, and mutual. Here are evidence-informed ways to do that:

🧠 **Shift from “Why” to “What” Questions**
Instead of asking “Why am I feeling disconnected?” try “What relationships do I want to strengthen, and what’s one way I can do that this week?” This small reframing enhances self-awareness and moves you toward action.

🤝 **Engage with Intentionality**
Block time—even just 15–30 minutes—for connection each week. This could be a check-in with a colleague, sending a thoughtful message, or grabbing coffee with someone outside your immediate circle.

🎧 **Practice Active Listening**
People feel most connected when they feel heard. Ask open-ended questions, reflect on what you hear, and avoid multitasking. It’s simple, but powerful.

🧩 **Find Values-Aligned Communities**
Join groups or communities (online or in person) where you feel psychologically safe and where your values align. This is especially important for underrepresented or neurodivergent leaders who may not find belonging in traditional workplace structures.

🔄 **Create Simple Shared Rituals**
Establish consistent routines—like a monthly lunch with a mentor or a weekly walk with a friend. Regularity deepens trust and lowers the emotional energy needed to reconnect each time.

🛑 **Respect Boundaries (Yours and Others')**
You don’t need to connect with everyone, all the time. Boundaries protect your energy and make space for deeper, more meaningful interactions with those who truly matter.

### Weekend Reflection Prompt

As part of my *Leadership Momentum Weekends* series, I invite you to take 10 minutes this weekend and reflect:

* Who are the 3 people I feel most supported by right now?
* When was the last time I intentionally connected with each of them?
* What’s one small action I can take this weekend to nurture those connections?

It doesn’t have to be a grand gesture. A thoughtful check-in, a voice note, or a short call can go a long way.

---

This series is about intentional growth—not hustle. Working on yourself *is* self-care when done mindfully. If you want to be a more resilient, emotionally intelligent, and effective leader, building stronger relationships is one of the best places to start.

I’d love to hear your perspective:
**What kinds of relationships have made the biggest difference in your leadership journey?**
Or—what gets in the way of building the kind of connections you want?

1mfz0rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mfz0rq/does_the_cosori_pour_over_coffee_maker_provide/,Does the COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker Provide the Best Brewing Experience Review?,"The COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker Pour Over Coffee Maker is a slick brewing companion that has become a feature in my daily coffee routine. With its unique double-layer stainless steel filter and heat-resistant glass decanter, this is a coffee maker that strikes a balance between style and function. Honestly, I didn't expect to become that person who shows off their coffee maker to visitors, but here we are. Making a flavorful cup of coffee in this sleek glass vessel has turned into an oddly therapeutic ritual for me each morning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unpacked this coffee maker, I could tell the design was thoughtfully crafted. The borosilicate glass decanter isn’t just aesthetically pleasing—the clarity of the material also makes it easier to monitor the brewing process. Its natural wooden handle not only looks chic but provides decent insulation. I found it extremely useful for avoiding scalded fingers when handling the hot carafe. The decanter holds up to 34 ounces of coffee, which translates to about eight cups; this turned out to be great when my coffee-loving friends came over. Plus, the double-layer stainless steel filter stands out. Not only does it save money on disposable filters, but I also noticed that it catches the fine particles effectively without absorbing coffee oils, resulting in a fuller, richer taste in every single cup. It's easy to see why manual coffee-making devotees would prefer this setup.

**Ease of Use**  
Although I initially thought using a pour-over coffee maker would be complicated, this one proved me wrong. From setting up the filter to pouring the water, the process felt intuitive even for a lazy coffee drinker like me. Anyone concerned about cleanup should worry less; the decanter and filter are dishwasher safe. However, the wooden sleeve does require a bit of manual effort with a damp cloth, though it only takes a minute. Honestly, cleaning other coffee-making equipment I’ve owned has often felt like a hassle, but here? Almost none.

**Brewing Performance**  
What impressed me most about this pour-over coffee maker was its flexibility. You can tinker with variables like the grind size, water flow, and temperature to create a cup suited to your taste. In my case, I prefer a slightly stronger brew. Using a medium-coarse grind and adjusting the water-to-coffee ratio turned out beautifully every time. As a side note for iced coffee fans, the pour-over method works equally well for cold coffee—even in summer, this coffee maker won’t disappoint.  

**Advantages**  
- The reusable stainless steel filter saves both time and the cost of single-use paper filters.  
- High-quality borosilicate glass ensures safety, even if exposed to low heat for stove reheating.  
- The stylish wooden handle insulates well and elevates the overall aesthetic.  
- Perfect for both hot and iced coffee preparations.  

**Negatives**  
- The wooden handle, though durable, requires manual cleaning to maintain its appearance.  
- It may not be ideal for those accustomed to programmable or hands-free brewing methods.  
- While sturdy, the glass construction might feel fragile to some users.  

**Competing Products**  
While researching, I compared this to a few products like the Chemex and Hario V60. The Chemex offers a more classic design, but it depends on paper filters and lacks the reusable filter convenience of the COSORI coffee maker. Meanwhile, the Hario V60 is an excellent pick for purists but demands a steeper learning curve to master the brew. Compared to these, this product offers a nice mid-ground with both simplicity and adjustability.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the quality of the materials, the long-term savings offered by the reusable filter, and the ability to customize your brew, this coffee maker justifies its price well. While I wouldn’t say it’s a bargain-basement product, it’s definitely better value than investing in pricier electric machines or pod systems. For anyone who genuinely enjoys the process of making coffee (and believes coffee prep is part science, part art), the investment feels worth every penny.

1mfz0jx,https://i.redd.it/w0zv0v6rnngf1.jpeg,"""Peppercorn"" mock whiskey","Hey there r/mocktails !  I've been looking for more interesting NA evening drinks, and how I can combine that with my weird culinary habits.

  
My general sense is that mocktails are just super fancy juice and iced tea mixes, so I take a lot of inspiration from the herbal tea world.  Also (hear me out) soup making.  

  
This one is pretty far out there, but I feel it's already better than anything I've bought commercially for a mock whiskey.  I'm intending to hit more of a corn mash style like a bourbon.

  
I'm still fine tuning the proportions,  but so far I am happy with the ingredients.

* One liter of water
  
* Crushed fresh sweet corn cob. This provides some sweetness, some body, and a subtle corn and malt flavor.  It's pretty common to add something like popped corn to a mock whiskey, but I have found this to be too toasty and corny.  The cob by itself is much more nuanced and subtle.  

* Pink peppercorns, whole, lightly crushed.  These are much more floral and fruit than black peppercorns.  They provide a nice bite to the brew and nice aromatics.  These pink peppercorns are a very common ornamental tree where I live in California, so I have a pretty easy supply of them 

* A couple Rooibos tea bags.  This adds color and some woody vanilla notes.  In general Rooibos is a great start to any mock brown liquor.

* A pinch of smoked lapsang tea.  This stuff is intensely smokey.  It provides more woody notes to compliment the rooibos and also a subtle smoke notes.  A little goes a very long way here, so the caffeine shouldn't be a problem for an evening drink.

* A pinch of jalapeno core.  Just a tiny bit of the inside white part of a jalapeno for a bit of a lingering bite. I don't really think this is necessary if you are using a lot of pink peppercorns.

* Sweetener.  This one is optional.  I've tried it with maple syrup and it works ok if you don't use much or you use an extra light syrup.  A darker maple will smother the flavor.  Simple syrup or a fruity mixture works pretty well for this too.

The recipe is just to put it all in a pot, let it come to a slow boil, cover it and let it steep for a few hours.  Then strain it all through a paper coffee filter and put in the fridge.

1mfyzea,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mfyzea/misfortune_of_a_pizza_guy/,Misfortune of a pizza guy,"If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be “nobody”. I blend into the background so well, most of my classmates from high school don't even remember me. My name is John. At least it's what I go by. Nobody gets my actual first name right. I am a twenty three year old guy who still lives at home. My deadbeat father walked out when I was two and I was raised by my mother. I barely graduated high school. I don't know how I didn't have to repeat any years. I've given up on the thought of ever having a girlfriend. Now, I deliver pizzas. Still not knowing what I want to do with the rest of my life. The only escape I have from reality is stories. On what few breaks I had, I would read short stories on my phone. I would listen to conspiracy podcasts while I drove. Most of the time, I would imagine myself in these stories. Just to feel like I was important for once in my life. 

I was driving on the highway one night to my next delivery. It was just another night of a sixteen hour shift, podcasts, and praying that my shit box of a car wouldn't break down. My manager Kyle, who knew that I was already on my third day this week of working this long, caught me as I was about to punch out. He said since I was still technically on the clock, I had to take this last delivery. Without overtime pay mind you. I tried to imagine a wendigo busting down the front door and consuming him. But, for the thousandth time, nothing happened and I was in my car on my way to the delivery.   

The smell of the pizza on my passenger seat was making my mouth water. I had to mentally smack myself and refrain from sneaking a slice and blaming it on the kitchen. The podcast I was listening to was talking about some banned books and the impact of government overreach. I imagined myself smuggling books into the U.S. under the nose of federal agents. I felt my head starting to bob. I was so tired. Every so often, I would hit a pot hole that would snap me awake and I would listen to make sure that nothing was wrong with the car. I was really trying to save up for a new one. Or, at least, one that didn't have more rust and duct tape than anything else. I was also paying rent to my mother while I still lived with her. She insisted that I didn't have to, but I needed to do something. With her working as a nurse and my long hours, we barely saw each other anyway. I felt my eye lids get heavy. Maybe I could pull over for a minute and get a micro nap. No. I needed to get this done so I could go home. Despite my efforts, I closed my eyes for a brief moment. I looked up and saw headlights coming toward me. I grabbed the wheel and tried to steer out of the way. But I was too late. I heard the crunch of metal as I hit the oncoming vehicle. I looked past my steering wheel and saw a blur as someone got out of the back seat and ran into the woods. Before I could do anything else, everything faded to black. 

The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital room. It was the hospital my mom worked at. A nurse came in. “Oh good. You're awake.” I looked around. “What happened?” She walked over and looked at my chart. “You were in an accident. Another car swerved into your lane and hit you head on. It's a miracle you only had a minor concussion.” I sat up and examined myself. I didn't appear to have any injuries aside from a small bump on my forehead. Another nurse came in holding a bundle of my clothes. She set them on a chair and left. “Well,” said the first nurse. I didn't see a name tag. “Once you get dressed, you are free to go. Just come in if you have any questions or have any pain.” I thanked her and she left. After putting on my clothes, I left the room I was in and began walking down the familiar halls toward the exit. It was surprisingly quiet today. I passed the front desk and the receptionist nodded to me as I stepped out into the cool night air. I looked at my wrist out of habit to see the time. But my watch was gone.  Must have been ripped off in the accident. I pulled out my phone. The screen was completely shattered. Signing to myself, I began walking home. Luckily for me, it was only a couple of blocks away. The town I lived in wasn't very big. I guessed that I wouldn't have a job starting tomorrow. I knew that Kyle was the kind of guy to care more about the failed delivery than my well being. But, there was nothing I could do about it. The silence of the night was deafening. The only sound I could hear was the wind rustling the trees dotting the side walks. Normally I would put an earbud in and turn on some music when I walked. But since I couldn't do that, I decided to let my imagination run wild. I imagined myself fighting against a horde of zombies. Keeping the oncoming swarm at bay with machine guns and molotov cocktails.  

I was about half way home when I heard footsteps behind me. Snapping back to reality, I looked back and saw someone walking with their hands in their pockets and a hood concealing their face. I just shrugged to myself and continued walking. Even if it was a mugger, it wasn't like I had anything valuable on me worth stealing. It was then that I heard the sound of a vehicle approaching from behind. It passed me and parked along the sidewalk. Glancing around, I realized that there weren't any other cars driving by. I moved to the other side of the sidewalk to give the vehicle a wide berth. Once I was closer, I saw that it was a blacked out Suburban. The back passenger door opened. I heard the footsteps speed up behind me and I felt myself being shoved into the back seat. As soon as the door closed, a gag was put into my mouth and a hood was placed over my head. 

They drove for what felt like an hour in silence. Trying to guess where we were going blindfolded was way harder than the movies made it look. The driver pulled to a stop and I was dragged out of the SUV. I tried to go limp, but it was no use. The two people carrying didn't even slow down. I felt them slam me into a chair and zip ties put on my wrists. The hood was ripped off and I squinted, waiting for my eyes to adjust. Looking around, I didn't know where I was. My guess was that it was one of the empty warehouses at the edge of town. All around us work lights were set up, all facing toward me. There were three people standing in front of me. All of them were dressed in black with their faces hidden under  their hoods. The one in the middle approached me. Kneeling down, I could make out the faint smell of cigarettes. “Where’s the lamb?” He asked. I just stared at him. “Huh?” The man sighed in frustration. “The girl! Where is she?” I just shook my head in confusion. “I- I don't know what you’re talking about.” I could see the man's jaw clenching. He stood up and reached into his pocket. At first I couldn't tell what he had pulled out, but I immediately recognized the shape of a bowie knife. “Guess we’ll have to do this the hard way.” He said as he moved closer. Before I could protest, I heard a muffled thump as the left side of the man's head erupted in a shower of red and white chunks. The other two tried to react, but another two thumps sounded and they were on the floor laying in growing pools of blood. I just stared at the bodies in disbelief. After a moment, there was the sound of footsteps approaching from my left. Out of the darkness, another man appeared. This one was carrying a rifle. He stopped a few feet away and stared at me. “Are you here to help me or kill me?” I asked after a painfully long moment of silence. The man walked over and picked up the dead man's knife. I closed my eyes and waited for him to stab me. Instead, he cut the zip ties holding my wrists in place. I felt the circulation return to my hands. I looked up at him. His face was covered by a balaclava. “Come with me,” he said, walking away in the direction he came from. I stood up and looked at the bodies on the ground. I didn't know what was going on, but at that moment, the man with the rifle seemed like a safer bet. 

The man led me to a pickup parked just outside the warehouse gate. After hopping in, he turned to me. “What did they ask you?” I stared at him for a moment. My mouth dry. He pulled off the balaclava revealing his face. I didn't recognize him. Being in a town as small as mine, you would have seen everybody at least once. He had short black hair with hints of grey along the edges. His blue eyes were bright and piercing as he waited for my response. “Um. They wanted to know where a girl was.” He nodded slowly. “And?” “They did say something about a lamb. But that was it.” He just turned and started the engine. We rode for several minutes in silence. I kept glancing at him waiting for some explanation as to what was going on, but he kept quiet. My mind was racing. I was just in a car accident and walking home from the hospital. Why was I kidnapped and questioned about a girl? Once my mind slowed down and I realized that trying to figure it out in my head was going to get me nowhere, I asked. “So. Who are you? And what's going on?” The man finally looked at me. “Call me Bill.” He looked back at the road. “Whats going on?” I asked again. Bill made a sharp turn and we were in an alleyway between the deli and laundry mat. After looking around again, Bill finally looked at me. “Those people are after my niece. The van you were in an accident with was transporting her. But she escaped after you crashed.” I thought back to the accident. I did see someone get out of the van and run into the woods before I blacked out. “Now, they think you helped her escape and know where she is.” Bill continued. I stared at him for a long moment. “Who are they exactly?” There was a flash of headlight behind us as a car drove past the alley. Bill just shook his head. “Later.” He pulled out and we continued to whatever destination he had in mind. I reached for my phone again to call someone. But I remembered that it was shattered. I didn't even know who I would call in this situation. The police, my mother? All I knew was that I just got caught up in something I was not ready for. “Where are we going?” I asked. We had driven all around in what seemed like random directions before he pulled onto a back road leading out of town. “I have a cabin not too far from here. If there's one safe place she might have gone, it would be there.”                    

We drove for another several miles before turning onto a dirt road leading us deeper into the woods. Looking out, the moonlight cast eerie shadows through the trees. If I wasn't worried about my life at that moment, I would be imagining some monsters lurking in those shadows waiting for a chance to strike. I lurched forward as Bill came to a stop in front of the cabin. It wasn't much to look at. Just a simple log cabin with moss growing on the side of it. I guessed that it was likely used as a hunting shack in the fall. I hopped out of the truck and approached it. Bill was grabbing something out of the back seat. I reached for the knob when the door flew open and I was face to face with a girl. I guessed that she was in her early twenties. She had long dirty blond hair tied into a pony tail. She had a pale complexion with freckles dotting her face and deep emerald eyes. She was wearing torn jeans and a grey hoodie. Honestly, she was probably one of the most beautiful girls I’ve met. Especially in this town. The only thing I found unattractive about her was the pistol she had pointed at my chest. I swallowed hard and raised my hands slowly. “Um. Friendly?” I said cautiously. She glanced behind me and lowered the gun. “Uncle!” Bill had come up behind me carrying a rifle case and two backpacks. The girl shoved past me and hugged Bill. “Are you alright?” He asked, patting her on the back with the hand holding the case. She pulled back and nodded. She looked back at me. “Whose he?” She asked. “Um. I’m John.” I stammered. Bill looked back down the driveway. “Lets head inside.” I turned and entered the cabin. The main area had a couch, coffee table, bear skin rug, and several deer heads mounted on the walls. By one corner, there was a wood stove and a small dining room table with two chairs. To the right, there were two doors. One led to a bedroom and the other was a small bathroom. I walked over and sat on one of the wooden chairs. The girl sat on the couch as Bill set the packs next to the stove. I looked between the two. “What now?” I asked. Bill rummaged through one of the packs and pulled out two items. He tossed one to me and one to the girl. “You two wait here. I’m going to try and take care of this mess.” I looked down at what he tossed at me. It was an MRE. “There are water bottles in the packs.” He turned to the girl. “Notify me if anything happens.” He said, handing her a cell phone. “Be careful,” she said. Bill nodded and left. 

After we could no longer hear the truck, we just sat there in silence for a while in awkward silence. “So,” I said. “I don't think I caught your name.” She set the pistol on the coffee table and opened her MRE. “It's Jess.” I nodded as she pulled out a pack of Skittles. I wasn't feeling all that hungry. “Whats your story?” I asked. “Oh, you know.” She said, getting up and fishing a water bottle from one of the packs. “My parents were part of a cult. They had me. And now the cult wants to sacrifice me to their god for world peace or some bullshit like that. You?” I just stared at her dumbly. I couldn't tell if she was being serious. “Um. I was just delivering a pizza.” I said. She snorted and went back to eating her food. “You were the one that ran into us?” She asked after a minute. I nodded. “Sorry about your car.” I just shrugged. “I’ll deal with that when this is over.” For the next couple of hours we made small talk. Mostly about movies and our hobbies. Or, more like her hobbies. I didn't have many outside of reading and listening to stories. But she did find some of the ones I told interesting. At least, I hope she did. Eventually, Jess fell asleep. I did my best to stay awake and listen for Bill to return. I thought about what Jess said. Did I really stumble into some cult dispute? If so, what was I supposed to do about it? Just wait till Bill dealt with it? After trying to come to terms with my situation, I heard the sound of a vehicle pulling up. I didn't want to wake Jess, so I quietly stepped out the front door. I figured Bill might need help with something. After stepping out, I felt like something was wrong. Bill didn't shut the engine off. The headlights were pointing toward the cabin, so I couldn't see. I tried to block the light with my hand while my eyes adjusted, I realized that it wasn't Bill's pickup. The black SUV pulled up and the doors opened. Before I could do anything, I felt something hit me hard in the back of the head. Next thing I knew, I was on the ground. I heard the sounds of gun shots and Jess screaming. Through my blurring vision, I could see two people dragging a squirming Jess out of the cabin and into the vehicle. I heard the doors shut and the crunching of gravel before everything faded to black. 

I awoke to the feeling of cold water being splashed on my face. I shook my head as my vision returned. I was met with a very agitated Bill standing over me. Looking around, I was sitting on the couch. There were spots of blood on the floor alongside spent pistol casings. “What happened?!” Bill yelled. I was still a little dizzy. “They showed up and took her.” I said. Bill turned and flipped the table following a trail of swearing that would make a sailor blush. After a minute, he calmed down and looked at me. “Come with me,” he said. I stood up, still a little disoriented. I followed him out of the cabin and to the back of his truck. The bed had one of those toppers on it. Bill opened the back and I was shocked to see an unconscious man tied and gagged laying there. “Help me get him inside.” Not knowing what else to do, I complied. We worked together and dragged the man inside. We placed one of the chairs in the middle of the room and tied him to it. I noticed that he had a tourniquet wrapped around one of his legs just above some bloody gauze covering what looked like a bullet wound. I looked at Bill with a questioning look. He just shrugged. “What? He was running.” Bill walked over to the packs and pulled out another bottle of water. He splashed our captive and followed with a few hard slaps to wake him up. The man stirred and shook his head. Once he focused on Bill, he tried to break free on his restraints. Realizing his resistance was useless, he looked between me and Bill. Bill took out the gag. “Where did they take her?” The man just laughed. “You can't stop what we are doing.” I saw Bill grit his teeth. He reached behind him and pulled out a revolver and pointed at the man. He just smiled. “You think you can scare me wi-” Bill cocked the hammer. “Alright alright.” The man hung his head. “The old bowling alley at the edge of town. The ritual is going to take place in the basement.” Damn. That was easy. Bill lowered the hammer. Raising his hand, Bill struck the man in the temple with the grip of the pistol, knocking him unconscious again. After putting the gag back in his mouth, Bill walked over to the rifle case he brought in earlier. I was still just standing there, stunned by the interaction. “Hey!” Bill yelled, snapping me out of my stupor. He tossed me a rifle. It was an AR 15 with a red dot sight. “You know how to use it?” He asked. I nodded and he pulled out more equipment. I didn't have the heart to tell him that the only experience I had with guns was movies and Call of Duty. But it couldn't be that hard. Just point and click. He handed me two magazines for the rifle and a pistol in a holster. After I shoved the mags into my pocket and clipped the holster to my belt, we left the cabin and hopped into the truck. I looked at Bill. “Are we just going to leave that guy here?” He started the engine and began driving. “He’s not going anywhere. And nobody’s going to hear him out here. Besides, if he is wrong, I’m going to need to question him some more.” We peeled onto the back road and made our way back to town. 

After we entered the town's edge, I broke the silence. “So, what is going on exactly?” Bill sighed. “My idiot of a brother joined a cult some years back. Said it gave him purpose. He met a woman there and they had Jess. The cult believes that if they sacrifice a child born from two of their members, they can summon their god and bring a new utopia.” I stared at him. I had thought that Jess was just messing with me. “So, you want to save her and prevent the ritual from happening?” He looked at me as though I just said the stupidest thing ever. “No. Their religion is bullshit. I want to keep a bunch of wannabe coolaid drinkers from killing my niece.” I just nodded and shut my mouth for the rest of the drive. We pulled into the parking lot of the bowling alley and climbed out. “Whats the plan?” I asked. Bill grabbed his rifle out of the back seat and chambered a round. “Go in quietly and shoot anyone that isn't Jess.” He started walking to the building. I looked back at the truck. The keys were still in the ignition. I could drive away. I could try to get the cops. But what was I going to tell them? Hey, two people I just met are fighting a cult and one of them is about to be sacrificed to a false god. Not likely they would believe me. Even if they did, it would be too late. I just shook my head and began following Bill.

 Instead of going in the front door, we maneuvered to the back. Parked by the rear exit, were three vehicles. One of them was the same SUV that took Jess. Bill moved forward and opened the door. We waited for a moment and listened. Nothing. We quietly pushed our way in and began looking for a stairway to the basement. I wasn't much for any kind of sports, so the only time I ever came here was in elementary school for an after class activity. After a few minutes of sweeping, we finally found a door labeled “basement”. Bill looked to me with an anticipating expression. I raised my rifle toward the door and nodded. He grabbed the door knob and slowly opened it. We stood there, our rifles aimed at the darkness. We could hear the faint sounds of chanting coming from the bottom of the stairwell. “Shit,” Bill hissed. “They’re starting.” He entered the doorway and I followed close after. We moved quietly until we reached the bottom. This was clearly where the excess equipment was stored. There were boxes of spare pins and bowling balls. Near the far end of the basement, we could see five individuals dressed in black cloaks standing around a stone altar. How they got that down there I wasn't sure. There were two cultists standing on either side and one at the center. With my eyes adjusted to the low light, I could make out the form of Jess laying on the altar. She was restrained and clearly struggling to escape. The chanting died down and the cultist in the middle raised his hand to the ceiling as another one pulled out a long black dagger from their cloak. As they raised it, me and Bill rushed out and began firing at the group. Bill took out the two on the left as I fired at the ones on the right. Even with my lack of experience, the two went down without issue. The dagger clattered to the floor next to the altar. Once the four were down, we aimed at the remaining cultists in the center. He looked at us with a look of disdain. “You dare interrupt our rit-” His words were cut off as we both unloaded into him. His body slumped against the altar. I ran up as Bill searched the basement for others that might have been hiding. Jess’ hands were bound behind her back and duct tape covering her mouth. I grabbed the dagger at my feet and cut the zip ties freeing her. As soon as she was free, she wrapped her arms around me and held me tight. Not knowing what else to do, I just patted her on the back. “Thank you,” she said, tears in her eyes. Bill came up behind us. “We should get going.” We both nodded. 

As we began walking to the stairs, I felt a chill run down my spine. I looked back to the last cultist and saw his blood pooling around him on the altar. I realized that the liquid was moving. It was beginning to form some sort of symbol I didn't recognize. As soon as it did, A black smoke began emanating from it as runes on the altar began to pulse with a deep purple light. Through the black smoke, I  began to see black and oily tendrils begin to emerge. We jumped back toward Bill as more of this thing became visible. It was massive. Filling up the whole ritual area. Its skin was black and glossy. There were several mouths all along the round bulbous body. Those tendrils I had seen earlier had begun wrapping around the bodies of the dead cultists and it was beginning to eat them. The bodies were lowered into the multiple mouths and the squishing and crunching sounds that followed made bile rise to my throat. After a moment, I saw Bill shake his head and begin firing at the creature. That snapped me to my senses and I followed suit. Even Jess took the pistol from Bill's holster and began firing. However, the thing didn't even seem to notice the bullets hitting it. Too focused on its meal. I happened to glance down and saw the black dagger laying on the floor where I had dropped it. The tendrils seemed to be avoiding it. I looked to Bill, “cover me.” Before he could say anything, I ran forward emptying the last magazine for the rifle. As I reached the altar, one of the tendrils wrapped around my right leg and I felt gravity shift as I was lifted into the air. The now empty rifle fell out of my hands. I drew the pistol and began firing wildly at the thing. Seeming more irritated than hurt, it slammed me against the ground, knocking the wind out of me. I looked to my right. The dagger. I managed to grab it just as I was once again in the air. The tendril began squeezing harder and I felt something crack in my leg. I let out a scream of pain and anger. The thing seemed amused at that. I reached up and slashed at the tendril. The blade cut through the flesh with ease as a spray of black fluid soaked my pant leg. The thing let out a shriek as it released me. I fell to the ground and landed hard on my left arm. I felt something crack. The adrenalin pumping through me was enough to make me ignore the pain and stand. With the dagger in my other hand, I bolted forward and began slashing at the things flesh. It let out more shrieks of pain the more I hacked at it. Eventually it lay still. I was covered in the things black viscous blood. I stood there. Amazed. I had actually killed a monster. Not in my imagination, but for real. I limped toward the others who were staring at me with amazement. The black smoke returned and the body of the thing was beginning to disappear into it. Jess and Bill each took one of my arms and helped me up the stairs. 

Once we were outside I asked Bill, “what now?” He chuckled and shook his head. “Well. These weren't the only members of this cult. If what we saw down there is really what they are trying to summon, we need to do something about it.” I nodded. My throat was feeling a bit dry. “Let's do it.” I said. They both grinned and we walked to the truck. Beep. I looked around. “Did you hear that?” I asked. They both turned to me. Beep. “Hear what?” Jess asked. I stopped and listened. Beep. “That!” They looked at each other and shrugged. Beep. I felt a pounding in my head. Beep. My vision began to blur. “Are you ok John?” Jess asked. Beep. I closed my eyes and shook my head. Beep. I forced my eyes open. I was staring at a white ceiling. I couldn't move. Beep. I looked to my right and could just make out the heartbeat monitor. Looking to my left I could see my mom asleep on one of the visitors chairs. I tried to speak, but there were tubes in my mouth. All I managed to get out was a grunt. This was enough to wake mom up. She jumped up and ran over to me. She was still wearing her scrubs. “John! Thank God.” She pushed the call button and ran to the door. “Doctor! He’s awake.” I didn't know what was going on. After a minute, a doctor came in. “John. Can you hear me?” I nodded slowly. “Good. You were in an accident and have been unconscious for the past week.” I stared at him. Unable to speak. That couldn't be right. I was just with Bill and Jess at the bowling alley. My accident happened yesterday. And I was fine. After a bit, they took the tubes out of my mouth. “Where’s Jess?” I managed to croak out. My throat was dry as hell. My mom looked at me confused. “Who is Jess?” I sat up. My right leg and left arm were in casts. 

After a while, I was informed that I had fallen asleep behind the wheel when I was delivering that last pizza. I had gone off the road and slammed into a tree. A passing car had noticed me and I was brought to the hospital. I tried to ask about Bill and Jess. But nobody knew who I was talking about. After I was released, I tried to drive myself out to Bill's cabin. But no matter which way I went, I couldn't find the back road to his driveway. I even went to the bowling alley and talked to the owner. He told me the place didn't have a basement. When I try to remember what the cultists looked like, I couldn't. I soon had to come to terms with the fact that it was all a dream. Bill and Jess never existed. There was no cult. And I didn't kill a monster. I was back to being a nobody. The only good thing to come out of this was that the restaurant was investigated and it was found out that Kyle had been embezzling funds. He was arrested and the owners said I could come back to work once I was better. Of course now, I had to pay off my new vehicle and my medical bills.   

I learned a valuable lesson from this experience. No matter how great the story. How grand the fantasy. Or how vivid the dream. At the end of the day, I must always wake up.  ",2,1754162758.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

1mfyy7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mfyy7u/explore_the_best_tv_wall_mount_for_large_screens/,Explore the Best TV Wall Mount for Large Screens ECHOGEAR EGLF2,"The moment I set eyes on the Echogear EGLF2, I had high hopes. I needed a sturdy and reliable mount that could handle my oversized 75-inch Samsung TV without fuss, and this full-motion TV wall mount didn’t disappoint. From a user’s perspective, the design and usability are spot on. The promise of compatibility across all major brands, including LG, Sony, and Vizio, was reassuring, but it was only after putting it to the test that I truly appreciated everything this mount has to offer. 

**Ease of Installation**  
Getting this bad boy on the wall was surprisingly manageable, especially since I am nowhere near a DIY guru. The included drill template and hardware kit took out most of the guesswork. To my surprise, I finished installing it in about 30 minutes, which was quicker than I anticipated. I didn’t even get the chance to grab a second cup of coffee! The process was helped along by some clear instructions, although the template could benefit from slightly sturdier material to avoid slipping during alignment. That said, it was still way less stressful than wrestling with other TV mounts I’ve had over the years.  

[Check Echogear EGLF2 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b073qx1zms/)  

**Build Quality**  
The heavy-duty steel frame left me confident that my TV was not going to take a nosedive off the wall. Its capacity to handle TVs up to 90 inches or 125 pounds is nothing short of impressive. My 75-inch TV looks entirely secure, even when I extend the screen out to its full 22-inch maximum reach. The frame has a rugged finish and doesn’t bend or flex under pressure. It feels like a wall mount for the ages—it could probably outlive my television.  

**Adjustability and Versatility**  
The 130-degree swivel range and tilt options let me find that perfect angle, whether I’m curled up on the couch or cooking in the kitchen. I also love how it effortlessly slides back into a low-profile position just 2.4 inches from the wall to give that sleek, minimalistic look. I was apprehensive initially about how smooth the adjustments would be, but there is zero roughness when I swivel or tilt the screen. It’s incredibly fluid, almost like gliding on air.

**Highlights**  
- Compatible with nearly all TVs, boasting support for VESA patterns.  
- A robust steel frame capable of holding TVs up to 90 inches or 125 pounds.  
- Full-motion arm that allows for extension up to 22 inches and a 130° swivel.  
- Quick and easy installation process that won’t require a day-long affair.  

**Shortcomings**  
Of course, no product is perfect.  
- The wall template could be sturdier to avoid slipping during installation.  
- For older walls or those without sufficient studs, you may need extra anchoring hardware, which isn’t included in the box.  
- Adjusting the tilt angles on larger TVs can initially seem clunky while finding the right tension level.  

**Competing Products**  
As someone who has tried other mounts, the Echogear EGLF2 stands tall in a sea of mediocrity. Comparing it to models like the Mounting Dream TV Mount, the Echogear offers superior construction and smoother motion. Its ability to extend and retract while staying incredibly stable was significantly better. While the Mounting Dream is a bit more affordable, its range of motion feels stiff, and it doesn’t handle weight as reliably. On the other hand, the Sanus VLF728 fares well against the Echogear for high-end builds but reflects that in its premium cost. Ultimately, the Echogear strikes a balance between affordability and top-notch functionality, making it a happier medium for most people.

**Worth the Investment**  
The price point for this mount is pretty reasonable, considering the quality and features it offers. You could spend slightly less but would likely compromise on the material or smooth usability. On the flip side, you could pay a lot more without gaining much additional value. For its build quality, heavy-duty capacity, and seamless adjustability, this wall mount feels like a smart use of money. Investing in a reliable mount to safeguard your pricey TV feels like a no-brainer.

1mfyw8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mfyw8h/i_feel_numb/,I feel numb,"This is going to be a long post, i need to just get this off my chest.

Since my daughter was born 10 months ago, I've had real struggles with my mental health, especially postpartum rage and a 24-hour swallow of guilt and tearfulness that follows. It is something I have reached out for help with, and I am now on a low doss of antidepressants, which to be fair I haven't noticed a difference but I've only been on them 3.5 weeks so I'm still in the period of ""waiting and seeing"". 

However today has been rough, especially rough. My daughter has been sick recently with a nasty cough, and is still getting over it, so the last few weeks has been very minimal sleep, as to top it all off I'm a horrific insomniac. My daughter was up throughout the night last night, and was awake by 7am. By the time I got up with her this morning, I'd probably had around 5.5 hours total. 

My partner has been working all day, and has now gone out to celebrate a friend's birthday. 

Something's up with my daughter too, tantrums galore and maximum frustration. I don't know what has been bothering her especially today, I have tried everything in the book to help, nothing has worked. By 4pm I was feeling at the end of my whits. Since she woke up I had been used as a headbutting punching bag and I had been bitten all over by her. But if tried to keep my head up and carry on. By 6pm I'd had enough. I was in tears, so frustrated because it felt like I was going in circles and literally nothing was helping my daughter. 

Teething rings, Calpol, cuddles, being left alone, food, drink, dummy, blanket etc etc... nothing.

We are dogsitting for my partners' parents, and my daughter is obsessed with dogs. It was like Christmas morning this morning when she saw the dog here. So all day she's been trying to get close to this dog, but the feeling is not mutual and the dog has been trying to get away and keep to herself. 

My daughter is just learning how to cruise the furniture, but her feet get stuck and she trips over them, and she's not too steady supporting her weight anyway. The amount of head bangs to the floor or coffee table in thr process of trying to get to the dog has been unreal. But if I move her away to prevent the head bangs, she instead gets angry as I've taken her from the dog. 

By 7pm I was just so done with the day I started to feel numb. I can't feel frustration, I can't feel sad. I'm just numb. 

My partner is about to start a new job, and nights out are gonna be a given, if he gets stuck he gets stuck. So this means i'm gonna have another day like this, another overwhelming feeling and I'm dreading it and I feel awful for dreading it. I just want to crawl in a hole and never come out.

1mfyugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunkinDonuts/comments/1mfyugd/retaliation_at_my_dd/,Retaliation at my DD?,"For context, I’m a Starbucks barista, and a couple months ago two employees at my reg store asked me if Starbucks was hiring. Of course I gave them the information; I’m not gonna say no. Because of this, one of their managers left to go work for Starbucks and lately I’ve been treated a LOT different. The employees would talk to me, be nice, and all that jazz. Now? I get cold stares from management with exception of a couple people. My coffee order has been very wrong, and it used to never be like this. I get it every day, and now I’m so discouraged because it’s never right anymore. I literally went today to go order, the guy said “Hi!” In a very chirpy voice but then when he heard it was me, his voice changed drastically. Again, my order was wrong when I got my coffee. 
I don’t know what I did other than help two employees that wanted to work at Starbucks, work at Starbucks. Like? I don’t know why the managers are taking it out on me.
Not to sit here and go “woe is me”, but I’ve been grieving for the last couple days and my mental health has been on edge, so with all of this it kinda made me feel worse after that whole transaction I mentioned above. 
Like I said, there are a couple people that are kind to me literally everytime I see them but now it’s a cold shoulder from a lot of them. 
I’m sad because I’ve been going here for years, even before I worked at Starbucks. I found a different location but it’s a lot farther from my house and I don’t want to constantly go out of my way for dunkin.

Like, trust me I get it when it comes to working at a coffee shop. However, every time I go in theres like 4-6 people on shift, Starbucks we never get that many people. We run with 3 at MAX for the majority of the day, and we hand make a lot of our stuff. Not to sit here and say my job is harder, but there’s really no reason to be that rude to another person when you have several people on the floor.  I don’t take my anger out on people, and we can get immediately terminated if we act like this to customers, so why is it ok for Dunkin employees to be this way? 
Oh and I go to Dunkin because I genuinely love their iced coffee, and I just hate Starbucks iced coffee. So if anyone was wondering why I don’t just get Starbucks that’s why.

Okay so I (30FM) met this guy (32M) on facebook dating. We matched as friends and he messaged first. He asked about going out for coffee with a smokeable and walking his dogs.  Loved the DATE idea. We kept talking and a month later decided to finally meet up. He lived about 45 minutes from me and we agreed to meet in the middle in a small downtown I knew of. I was really nervous, I didn't know what to wear. Never had this problem before. Do I wear a dress? Do I wear something comfy and not try to look cute? It was super hot but now its chilly!! I was super nervous. I ended up going with something simple, jeans croptop and a knit throw over. I made sure to wear my 3"" thick heeled boots because this guy was 6F4"" and I am a mere 5F5.5"", so he will tower over me no matter what.
We met up, walked and talked for a few hours and then got some food. We stopped at a culvert since he didnt have one in his hometown and we were hankering for some burgers. I told him he could choose the seats and he found this 2 person booth where only 1 person can fit in a both so the 2 people are snug crossed from each other. His long legs and mine kept bumping into each other under the table.  We ate, laughed and talked, and the went outside to continue talking. He mentioned he was chilly so we went back to the car to talk and drove back to his. We got out to say goodbye and kept talking for another half hour. It was like we didn't want to stop.  He finally left and as I was driving home and smelled his cologne and it was INTOXICATING!! 
Second date comes along about 2 weeks later and I was excited. We were just going to go for another walk, maybe some ice cream, but he changed plans. I was to meet him at his place, go on my first motorcycle ride ever to a place an hour away, and then go hiking and swimming. It sounded fun and something i desperately needed, but going somewhere 2 hours away in the middle of the woods with someone I've only been speaking to for over a month... and a motorcycle ride too? I know, most would be skeptical,  but I went out if my comfort zone and it was worth it!!! It was sooo magical! Scary at first but that ride built some trust between us. The adventure was amazing and beautiful and he held my hand for support so I wouldnt fall, even though I did a few times slready...  a week later I remembered he was talking about sizing up his gauges but it hurt every time. I told him there was a next step and he wasn't aware. I went on Amazon one night and saw a cheap, less then $10 stainless steel tappers and gauges and thought of him. So I bought and sent them to him. I was super nervous because I just sent someone who I've only gone on 2 dates,  basically jewlery in the mail.  So he received them today and was happy but sounded hesitant and surprised. I overthink alot so I'm curious, 
Was this weird that I sent him gauges in the mail, or do you consider it sweet?

Last fall, I was walking my dog through the park when we saw a squirrel standing in the middle of the path. No big deal, right? Except this squirrel was *staring* at us, like it had something important to say.

As we approached, it started running toward my dog. Normally, squirrels bolt away at the sight of a dog, but this one… was running toward us with its tail straight out, like it was ready to throw down. My dog froze in confusion. The squirrel leapt—*yes, leapt*—and started circling my dog, wagging its tail like a dog!

It was the weirdest moment. A squirrel, acting like a dog, just following us for the next 10 minutes. Finally, it looked up at me as if asking for a treat and scurried off.

My dog spent the entire walk looking over its shoulder as if waiting for the squirrel to jump back in. It *never* has been the same around squirrels again.

  
2**​**. **The Time I Accidentally Got Stuck in a Kid’s Playground**

I decided to relive my childhood and visit a local park one afternoon, just for fun. It was one of those parks with one of those huge, twisted, multi-level jungle gyms, and I thought, ""Why not? Let’s pretend I’m a ninja warrior."" I climbed up to the top without thinking much about it. As I got higher, I realized two things:

1. I was the only adult there, surrounded by 6-year-olds who were way better at climbing than me.
2. I had no idea how to get down.

So, there I was, stuck at the top of the structure, watching the kids casually scramble past me like it was no big deal, and I started trying to figure out a way to escape without embarrassing myself. But every move I made, I looked even more ridiculous. Finally, one of the kids below yelled, ""Hey, are you stuck, mister?"" I nodded, defeated. Without missing a beat, a kid yelled back, ""You're too old to be up there!""

After about 20 minutes of trying to figure out how to safely jump (which felt like an eternity), a mother who was walking by had to give me a helping hand by asking me if I needed assistance. I was 26. I had to be escorted down from a kids' playground.

  
3. **The Epic Fail of Trying to Use a Self-Checkout Machine**

I went to the store to grab a few essentials, and I was feeling pretty confident. Self-checkout? Easy, right? I scanned my first item, a jar of peanut butter. No problem. Then the machine asks me to scan the next item. I scan it—nothing. I scan it again—nothing. I start to get frustrated and am about to call for help when a store employee walks by.

She looks at me, then looks at the machine, then looks at me again. ""It’s not scanning because you’re scanning your phone, not the item,"" she says.

I had been trying to scan the barcode on my *phone* instead of the actual items in my cart. This entire time.

  
4. **That Time I Tried to “Fix” the Coffee Machine at Work**

One morning, our office coffee machine broke down. The entire office was gripped by panic, and since I was the ""tech-savvy"" person in the office, I took it upon myself to fix it.

I Googled the machine’s model, watched a few YouTube tutorials, and confidently opened the machine, convinced I could fix it. I removed a few screws and started poking around inside. Big mistake.

Next thing I know, I’ve disassembled it completely, with no clue how to put it back together. I panic and try to close it up quickly, but I can’t. So, I resort to shoving it all back into place. I plug it in, and it makes this alarming, loud *grinding* noise. Then it *explodes*… all over me. Hot coffee everywhere. I’m now covered in coffee grounds, and everyone is staring.

End of story: The office manager had to call the repair guy anyway.

  
4. **When I Mistook a Stranger for My Friend at the Mall**

I was at the mall, walking with my friend when I spotted what I thought was *her* in a store. I walked up to this person, tapped them on the shoulder, and said, ""Hey, what’s up, girl? You didn’t tell me you were going to be here today!""

The stranger turns around, and I immediately realize this is NOT my friend. Not even close. She just stared at me, then said, “Um… I think you’ve got the wrong person?”

Flustered, I stammered something like, “Oh, wow! Sorry, I thought you were someone I knew!” The woman looked at me like I had three heads, then said, “I’ve never seen you in my life, but… thanks for the compliment?”

It wasn’t until later that I realized I had accidentally mistaken someone for my friend because we both had similar-looking hair… except my friend’s hair was purple. This lady’s hair was just… normal brown. Awkward level: Expert.",1,1754162379.0,Superfunnystories,0,1.0,False
1mfyts3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mfyts3/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_zojirushi_review/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Zojirushi Review Worth Reading,"Testing the Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB 10-Cup Coffee Maker has been an eye-opening experience for me as a coffee enthusiast. With its sleek combination of stainless steel and black tones, it doesn’t just sit on my countertop; it elevates the aesthetic of my kitchen. This isn’t just any coffee maker; it’s a serious machine for anyone who values their morning brew. From its 10-cup capacity to its specially designed iced coffee mode, the features seem to hint it’s built for those who appreciate versatility and quality in their coffee routine. Here’s what I discovered during my daily use of this coffee maker.

**Design and Build Quality**

The modern style of this coffee maker struck me immediately. Standing at approximately 14.88 inches tall, it feels solid and doesn’t occupy excessive counter space despite its capabilities. The stainless steel carafe is not only stylish but extremely functional, being vacuum-insulated to maintain temperature for hours. This design choice impressed me during weekend coffee breaks, where I could leisurely sip without my coffee turning lukewarm. The removable water tank adds convenience for filling and cleaning, and the buttons for operation are both tactile and intuitive, avoiding any frustrating learning curve. Of course, the unit comes with a reusable and washable stainless steel mesh coffee filter, which I loved not just for its practicality but also for its environmental consciousness.

**Key Benefits**

- The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for long durations without resorting to a warming plate, preserving flavor.
- A removable water tank simplifies refills and is easy to clean.
- The coffee filter is reusable and eco-friendly.
- A dedicated iced coffee mode ensures the right water-to-coffee ratio for a stronger brew that doesn’t taste watered down when poured over ice.

**Performance and Features**

Throughout my trial, this machine lived up to its promise of brewing at an optimal temperature of 200°F. This precise brewing temperature does wonders for coffee flavor extraction, and honestly, I noticed a clear difference compared to traditional methods that often fluctuate in temperature. It’s versatile enough to produce up to 10 cups of coffee, ideal for hosting or for heavy caffeine drinkers like me. What really impressed me, though, was its speed. There’s a time-saving mode that kicks things up a notch by reducing brewing time, and despite this efficiency, the flavor doesn’t suffer one bit. I typically enjoy exploring the settings on a new gadget, and here, every feature felt intuitive and purposeful, with no gimmicks.

**Shortcomings**

- It lacks a built-in grinder, meaning you need pre-ground coffee or a separate grinder.
- While sturdy, the coffee maker is heavier than many alternatives at nine pounds.
- It doesn’t include any ""smart"" features like app connectivity.

**Ease of Use**

Right out of the box, setting up this coffee maker was straightforward, and even my tech-handicapped neighbor found my explanation of its operation easy to follow. The buttons are clearly labeled, and programming it to brew fresh coffee for my early morning routine was a breeze. I especially appreciated the thumb-activated pouring design for the carafe, as it made serving coffee during a recent brunch mess-free and without any spills. Cleaning the unit felt just as simple. The removable water tank and washable filter cut down time I’d usually spend scrubbing accessories, not to mention reducing the likelihood of lingering residues affecting the next brew.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing this coffee maker to popular competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Technivorm Moccamaster highlighted its specific strengths. The thermal carafe design beats warming plate mechanisms used in most other models by maintaining coffee temperature without burning the flavor. However, the Moccamaster does offer faster brewing in some cases. The Zojirushi’s iced coffee functionality places it ahead of most other options, which often struggle to provide strong enough brews for iced variations. On the downside, drip coffee makers such as the Breville Precision Brewer include integrated grinders, which adds to versatility. If grinding beans fresh is as important as brewing temperature for you, this may be a key consideration.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

While this machine may not fall into the “budget” category, the quality and features justify its price. The energy-efficient thermal carafe, durable materials, and precise brewing temperature all speak of a long-term investment in coffee enjoyment rather than opting for a replaceable, cheaper option. Budget-conscious shoppers might hesitate, but given the performance and functionality I observed, it’s not just about flash—it’s about longevity and reliability.

I appreciate some may vary from firm to firm, and that others won't impact me directly for a while but I'd still like to know experiences.

1. Could someone please explain the ""partner"" and ""equity partner"" thing? I understand that equity partners have a stake in the firm - do you ""buy in"" like in Suits and the Good Wife? How does the process work?

2. With billable hours targets (my firm doesn't have one for trainees), are you expected to hit that and will have negative feedback if you don't? Or is it just that you need to do that to get your bonus? What if, as a junior (as has happened as a trainee) you're asked to do a lot of pro bono or business development or non-billable client work by partners?

3. How does retention really work? If they need to decide between two people - what actually matters? Does it matter more if my work is better or if I've had coffees with more people or if I do well in the interview...?

I'm on the hunt for something special: a serious, healthy, and stable relationship. Think less ""Netflix and chill,"" more ""Netflix and build a future"" (though chilling is definitely on the menu!). My big thing? Open and honest communication and reciprocal effort/energy. If we're not feeling it, I'll be upfront, no ghosting, no breadcrumbing – just mutual respect. I expect the same from you!

So, Who Am I? I'm 34, Asian, 5'7"", and enjoying life in the Golden State. My mornings are powered by coffee (sometimes the afternoons too, don't judge!), and while I might start a bit socially awkward, give me a minute. I promise I can hold a conversation like a champ once I get warmed up.

* Day Job: I tackle IT challenges for a hotel management company. Basically, I make sure the digital world plays nice so everyone else can enjoy their vacations.
* Homebody (with an outdoor streak): You'll often find me nesting at home with my hobbies, but I definitely ""touch grass."" Think swimming, snorkeling, or even a competitive game of mini-golf or pickleball!
* Gaming Life: Huge fan of video games, especially co-op ones. Playing with others is seriously way more fun.
* Entertainment Obsessed: My watch list is probably longer than my arm. Movies, TV shows, anime – if it's got a great story, I'm probably watching it.
* Reading: I dive into manga, manhwa, and light novels. Got any recommendations?
* Pokémon Picks: Snorlax is my undisputed favorite, with Psyduck and Gengar tied for second. Who are your faves?
* Animal Lover: Obsessed with all animals, especially marine life (Orca overlords, when?!).
* Fun Fact: My favorite animal is a sloth. Did you know these slowpokes are surprisingly amazing swimmers?
* Mind Matters: I'm really interested in psychology. What makes people tick? Let's discuss!
* Travel Bug: Diagnosed with a severe case of wanderlust! I've explored Mexico, Japan, Thailand, and Canada, and my bucket list is constantly growing.
* Foodie Adventures: I'd absolutely travel just for the food. Food tourism, anyone? My taste buds are ready for adventure.
* My Vices (or lack thereof): Never smoked, and I only drink occasionally for social events.
* Beliefs: I'm an atheist.
* Personality Bits: I'm a Leo, an INFP, an overthinker, and a big-time texter. I'm genuinely curious about your passions and what makes you smile!

What I'm Hoping to Find in You:

* Non-smoker, and doesn’t do drugs
* Caring, accepting, respectful, compassionate, and emotionally intelligent – basically, a good human!
* Open and direct communication/intentions – let's keep it real.
* Consistency – showing up is important.
* Shares some common interests (but also excited to introduce me to new things!)
* Child-free

Ideally, you'd be somewhere in the US, and the closer to the West Coast, the better, but I'm open to seeing where things lead! Once we're comfy chatting via text, I'd love to jump on Discord for voice or video chats.

If this sounds like your kind of adventure, and you've got your own awesome set of interests and quirks to share, send me a message! When you message me, please introduce yourself, tell me your top three dream travel destinations, and please be open to sharing a selfie as I'd like to see who I'm talking to.

1mfyqvw,https://i.redd.it/nnwwqtomlngf1.jpeg,Hishio and nattoh miso + on the subject of books,"**Good morning everyone!**

I started a batch of *hishio* and *nattoh miso* using recipes from the book *“Miso, Tempeh, Natto & Other Tasty Ferments”* and wanted to share some of my thoughts.

I made the *hishio* with the addition of raspberry tomatoes, and the *nattoh* with the same tomatoes and kombu.  
I’m keeping the jars at room temperature (in my case, that’s 24–27°C). After two weeks, the *hishio miso* was already tasty enough that I made breakfast with it—rice, soft-boiled eggs, sesame oil, and the miso. It was delicious—much tastier at this stage than the *nattoh*.

I had the opportunity to test the batches daily, since I stirred them once a day with a clean spoon (although I started stirring only after 2–3 days). I was lucky— the only thing I had to remove was a layer of fresh *koji* on the surface.

After that period, I went to another city for one night and brought a tightly sealed jar of *hishio miso* as a gift. After arriving, I put it on the counter but didn’t open it (the thought of the Queens of the Stone Age concert was too overwhelming).  
The next day—exactly 24 hours later—I opened the jar, which greeted me with gas and a puff of smoke. The miso instantly turned sour. It wasn’t spoiled, but the flavor profile changed in a way that just didn’t work for me, so I had to treat it as a valuable lesson for the future.

I won’t lie—I was disappointed. Up to that point, the *nattoh miso* had been far behind in terms of flavor. Until today.

I’m just 10 minutes past my routine stirring and tasting, and I’m shocked. The miso developed notes of chocolate and coffee—the flavor really ""rounded out"" and blew me away. Absolutely delicious!

I recommend trying both, because it’s such an interesting experience—waiting for the flavors to evolve in miso that needs longer aging.

Lastly, I’d like to touch on the topic of books I’ve seen mentioned here on this subreddit.  
I got the impression people are somewhat divided between *“Koji Alchemy”* and *“Miso, Tempeh, Natto & Other Tasty Ferments”*.  
I don’t understand why— I recommend reading both. *The Noma Guide to Fermentation* as well. Each of them deserves it.

He also started liking all of my stories, sth he didn’t do before, and made compliments on my looks etc. We ended up texting everyday for at least a week and he always mentioned how we could meet up and drink matcha or coffee as those are drinks that I often post on my stories but as soon as he mentioned meeting up with him I stopped texting him as much as I used to beforehand.

1mfyo4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1mfyo4m/thoughts_on_pickup_store_closings/,Thoughts on Pickup Store Closings,"To give context: I have not been doing well lately, and I suffered a complete breakdown at work today and left, so I pretty much don't have a job anymore. So that makes my perspective even less valid, and I always considered myself an NPC that served the main characters coffee, so that's saying something.  But I feel this all strongly, and I've already humiliated myself and screwed everything up... So...

(You can probably disregard everything below because of the above disclaimer)

This whole 'me not doing well' has been going on for about the last 2 months now. But the last couple of days have been even rougher. I now realize that the announcement regarding pickup stores being closed has been like a knife to the heart for me. And reading it back, it sounds even more childish, ridiculous, and immature than what you probably did trying to read that through the first time. I already mentioned I haven't been doing well...

And I am rational enough to recognize it's a 'business decision.' It’s not personal. For it to be even suggested it's personal, I would have to be a somebody, but I’m a nobody. (NPC) 

But I feel it. I understand the desire to create more conducive environments to foster a sense of community and connection. And recognizing the obstacles that might hinder personal connections is necessary when prioritizing connections. I just think that removing the obstacles altogether is removing an opportunity to make an even meaningful connection with customers. And I also acknowledge I’m ignorant of the financial, logistical, and personnel factors in this decision, but I still staunchly believe it’s a missed opportunity.

I have always found the pickup store to be a solution in a particular context. I work, well worked, in a city center. The vast majority of our customers are regulars. They work in skyscrapers for major companies, and if the elevators are down, it's gonna be a bad day. Most mornings, I can get a good idea of the time based on who is coming in because of their schedules. And I do wonder if the rigors and demands of their job afford them the time to go to a 3rd place to connect regularly. 

But they still want their caffeine. And most certainly can be benefited with a sincere connection. And if, instead of removing the obstacle, a less-than-ideal environment and setting for connection, look for ways to work through, I think you can not only develop and build these connections, but also make them more impactful, within reason (I'm delusional, but I'm expecting birthday party invitations delusional). 

Since I've started, I've always found myself challenged and inspired to take the transactional exchange as an opportunity to make a relational connection. And I think I succeeded. I did some good. And that’s saying something, because I think very poorly of myself and have the worst self-esteem. It's pathetic to acknowledge I'm gonna miss them. 

More than anything, I'm gonna miss the opportunity to brighten up someone’s day because  I know how much it would have meant to me.

My wife talks daily to a married male ex-coworker I don’t like... and I'm struggling to understand if this emotional closeness is crossing a line.,"Hi everyone...

As an overthinker, I genuinely need some good and sorted advice.

I’m 32M, married to a 32F. We’ve been married for 1.5 years.

The thing with my wife is... she gels more with guys than girls. She’s a bros bro kind of girl. And I’ve never had a problem with that. I’ve always felt secure and open in our relationship.

But there’s this one guy..her ex-coworker..they worked together for years and are now in different cities. They’ve been friends since before I came into the picture. She says it’s all chill between them... nothing serious, just friendship.

Still, I’ve never got a good vibe from him. It’s not about flirting..he doesn’t openly cross lines..but the constant banter, the emotional dependency, and the backstory just makes me uncomfortable.

He’s married too... has a kid... but also cheated on his wife. He fell in love with a girl during that affair and truly believed they’d end up together. When the girl got married and cut ties, he went into a meltdown. And my wife.. being that “always-there” friend..emotionally supported him through it all.

Even now... they still talk daily. During work hours, it’s short calls to “clear doubts” 1 or 2 minutes. Sometimes they order each other coffee or snacks..like a ritual they’ve kept from their workdays together. But even after work... like when she’s on a walk or at home, they still end up talking.

And when she doesn’t talk to him for 3–4 days.. for whatever reason..he gets pissed. Cold responses, weird vibes. And then my wife tries to make up by sending him a coffee or something. That part honestly stings me a little.

Back when we were shifting cities... obviously she was super busy with packing, travel, setting up the new place.. she couldn’t talk to him much. He acted up again... sulked. That time I told her..“Enough... what is this?” And she said, ""Give it some time... slowly slowly all this daily talk will fade.” I believed her. But it's been 2 months... and it’s still the same story.

She knows very well that I don’t like the guy. I’ve been open about it... but I never asked her to cut ties. I don’t want to sound controlling. I’m not someone who invades her space... I rarely ask to check her phone. But sometimes when I get that itch... I do ask.. maybe once or twice a month.. and it’s always the same pattern.

Also, I want to add that what I’ve shared here is just what I notice when I’m home. My job keeps me away for half of the year... and that’s why this unsettled feeling lingers even more.


What I want advice on is this:
How do I communicate my discomfort in a way that’s honest but not possessive..

Where do I draw the line between emotional boundaries and being overly sensitive..

And how can I express to her that this dynamic.. even if nothing is “wrong”..is impacting me and our relationship?

Thanks for reading... any insight would really help me reflect and handle this better.

1mfyndy,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1mfyndy/how_do_you_track_your_deliveries/,How do you track your deliveries?,"*(Before you start reading: I don't mean GPS tracking. I'm talking about tracking if, when, and in what condition items get delivered.)*

If you run a coffee shop (or manage one), you know deliveries can get messy. Sometimes stuff just doesn’t show up. Or you get a partial delivery. Or it’s damaged. Or there’s the wrong item in there.

Right now, we use our work WhatsApp group. I post a screenshot of the order confirmation page so the team knows what to expect and when. They then reply to that message with “here” or “here but missing X” or “wrong milk” etc. As you can imagine, it quickly turns into chaos and clutters the chat. What's more annoying is that people who are not on shift also get notified about them.

For context: we get multiple deliveries a day (milk, pastries, cakes, takeaway cups, cleaning supplies, etc.) and have 10+ suppliers. I don't want to create a separate group just for deliveries (no one wants two work chats), and it would still be messy anyway.

I also don’t think an Excel sheet is the answer. I don’t want to manually type 30+ line items for every order, and I don’t expect my team to navigate an Excel doc on a tiny phone screen.

What do you use to keep track of deliveries in real time without adding more chaos?

Below is what our WhatsApp chat looks like, and it's so inefficient and annoying!

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency many thanks. Please be aged between 25 and 32 thank you 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1mfyls6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mfyls6/does_the_technivorm_kbt_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Technivorm KBT Coffee Maker Truly Elevate Home Brewing?,"The Technivorm Moccamaster KBT immediately caught my attention. Measuring a sleek 6.75”D x 11.5”W x 15.25”H, it feels thoughtfully sized for any kitchen countertop. Its stone gray metallic finish adds a modern touch that blends well with both minimalist and vibrant decor. While you don't need a designer's eye to appreciate it, I personally found friends commenting on how ""fancy"" it looked. The thermal carafe gives it a professional vibe, perfect when hosting coffee lovers.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**

The beauty of this coffee maker lies in its manual-adjust, drip-stop brew-basket. I fiddled with the settings to control the coffee flow, and it felt quite forgiving, even for someone like me who isn’t the biggest espresso expert. The machine brews a full 40oz pot of coffee in just six minutes; it genuinely impressed me every morning when I needed that quick caffeine fix. Since I prefer staying up late binging shows, having my coffee brewed so fast (and tasting smooth) was a lifesaver. 

The thermal carafe does an excellent job of maintaining heat. It promises to keep coffee hot for up to an hour, and I tested it while preoccupied with morning chaos—it lived up to its claim. For longer errands, I swapped the lid with the included travel lid, and the temperature stayed stable for hours.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07ddrgvw7/)

**Winning Points**

- Distinct metallic and stone gray design elevates kitchen aesthetics.  
- Adjustable brew basket enhances the customization of brewing.  
- Includes a thermal carafe and travel lid for versatility.  
- Brews 40oz quickly—ideal for busy mornings or multiple servings.

**Critiques**

- Manual operation might frustrate someone wanting push-and-go functionality.  
- The price point could deter casual coffee drinkers.  
- A paper filter system isn’t for everyone—some prefer reusable alternatives.  

**Good Points**

One standout aspect is how handcrafted and well-made this coffee machine feels. Produced in the Netherlands and backed by an impressive five-year warranty, you'll know from the first use that this isn't something hastily assembled. I've had cheap coffee makers in the past that started giving me problems within months, but this one comes across as seriously built to last. The manual controls ensure that every pot of coffee is brewed with precision, perfect for craft coffee lovers, though if you're looking for “quick and mindless,” this may not fit seamlessly into your routine.

**Machine Limitations**

While reliability and craftsmanship shine, the manual features can be a sticking point for some. Not having automatic settings or a programmable timer, for example, can feel like a missed opportunity in its tech-savvy competitors' market. I missed waking up to already-brewed coffee on Sundays, so over time, I adapted to the delay. Additionally, although the paper filter system works efficiently, those looking for an eco-friendlier machine might find their searches continuing.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing it to common alternatives, the Technivorm Moccamaster carves its niche for coffee enthusiasts seeking precision and quality. While brands like Breville and Cuisinart offer similar price points, their emphasis leans towards features like touchscreens or automatic programs. Yet, these fancy extras often lack Technivorm’s robust performance or reliability over time. On one hand, Keurig is much simpler for pod lovers and costs slightly less upfront, but anyone that cares about craft brewing likely won’t be satisfied by pods. Looking at the competition, this product effectively bridges tradition and craftsmanship in ways newer systems often lack.

**Affordable Quality**

Although its price initially made me pause, testing it out daily allowed me to recognize the value behind its design. The thermal carafe, brewing customization, and even the craftsmanship make the Technivorm KBT feel thoughtful for serious coffee drinkers. If you want flashy features like auto-programming, you’ll likely feel its sticker shock—otherwise, my impression is it’s an investment for perfectionists who care about their brews.

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Love storytelling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after are all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully along the way, sparks fly.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.

Otherways if i don't go to the gym, or don't do anything intensive i will never have them before sleeping.

i don't drink tea / coffee or take any pre-workouts

Got my cortisol tested and adrenaline, both was in range

I have an echo made on my heart and ecg, nothing crazy on it (they was done ofc durring day when i don't have my ""heart jumps""

Any idea what it can be so i can adress the concern to my cardiologist?",7,1754161599.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1mfyhgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mfyhgw/explore_best_milk_frother_options_with_foodville/,Explore Best Milk Frother Options with FoodVille MF05 Performance,"Testing out the FoodVille MF05 milk frother has been one of the more delightful ventures in my kitchen experimentation. If you're someone who survives on lattes and bulletproof coffee, or even if you’re just looking to spice up your morning tea routine, this gadget could easily sneak into your daily essentials. This latest FoodVille edition, MF05, promises USB-rechargeable convenience, multiple attachments, and a sleek design that screams versatility. However, as much as I enjoyed frothing my way into coffee shop-style beverages, there are a few nuances worth mentioning.

**Intuitive Design and Build Quality**  
Opening the package, the milk frother felt sturdy and compact, with dimensions of 1.6 inches wide and 7 inches tall, making it slightly smaller than most kitchen gadgets but still comfortable to hold. The white color gives off a minimalist, modern vibe, but what surprised me the most were the stainless-steel whisk and balloon head attachments. I appreciated the lightweight construction, only 6.4 ounces, but the plastic handle did make me hesitate a bit—durability over time might be a concern. Swapping the heads was painless, and the USB charging feature is a pure blessing if you're ever out of batteries mid-foam.

**Performance Excellence**  
This milk frother truly delivers when it comes to performance. With two speed settings, including a turbo mode, I tested its frothing power on cold milk, hot almond milk, and oat milk. The turbo mode nearly splashed a bit of milk the first time because it was so powerful! It’s an amazing option not just for beverages but also for whipping protein powder or gently blending matcha without clumping. Switching off without cycling through all modes—just one simple button press—is one of those “small wins” I didn’t know I was missing until now.

[Check FoodVille MF05 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b07v2zgyj1/)  

**Rechargeable Convenience**  
I fully charged the frother before testing, which only took about an hour or so with the Type C USB charger. On a full charge, it seemed to hold up for weeks with daily usage—this kind of efficiency is ideal for those like me who don’t want to worry about grabbing extra AA batteries. It's easily portable for trips, too, without hauling a charging cable everywhere. After a month, I noticed no dip in power consistency, even when using turbo mode frequently.

**Highlights**  
- USB Type C rechargeable design ensures quick charging and long battery life.  
- Two speed modes, including turbo mode, allow for high-speed frothing and versatile uses.  
- Compact and lightweight, making it travel- and storage-friendly.  
- Easy one-button operation prevents messes and splashes.  

**Downsides**  
That being said, there were a couple of things that could be better.  
- The frother handle is plastic, which might not appeal to those looking for a more premium feel or longevity.  
- In turbo mode, the whisk can create some splashing if you’re not careful, especially with lightweight liquids like skim milk.  
- Be mindful with attachments–while swapping heads wasn’t difficult, I kept worrying about wearing out the connection points over time.  

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to similar products like the Zulay Milk Frother or handheld KitchenAid frothers, the FoodVille MF05 offers clear advantages with its rechargeable USB design and turbo mode. Zulay's frothers do have great power and are priced competitively, but they rely entirely on disposable batteries, which is less convenient. KitchenAid’s whisks are charming but bulkier and lack the high-speed versatility of FoodVille’s latest model. On the flip side, Zulay does have a more metallic finish that exudes premium quality, whereas the plastic handle on the MF05 might feel slightly underwhelming by comparison.

**Value for Money**  
Given the decent build, versatile attachments, and turbo-powered frothing, this milk frother certainly leans toward excellent cost efficiency. It modernizes the experience without dragging buyers into the live-by-batteries dilemma, which adds significant value to anyone's kitchen, especially frequent frothers like me. While the plastic construction might detract from the otherwise thoughtful engineering, it’s fair to say that the overall price-to-quality ratio leans favorably.

1mfyh09,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mfyh09/explore_if_best_wireless_earbuds_huawei_freebuds/,Explore if Best Wireless Earbuds HUAWEI FreeBuds Pro 3 Impress,"HUAWEI Piano-T100 FreeBuds Pro 3 entered my life with more sophistication than I expected from a pair of earbuds. As someone who hops between calls, workouts, and binge-listening sessions, I wanted to test just how much these sleek little buds could keep up. And spoiler: They certainly pack a lot into their tiny frame. But are they perfect? Let’s dig in.  

**Design and Comfort**  
At first glance, their Silver Frost finish screams premium. Light reflects off the metallic sheen, and holding them feels just as lux as it looks. The Piano-T100 FreeBuds are comfortably lightweight at just 45.5 grams, and that includes the case. The ""rounded tip"" earpiece design is a godsend for longer wear. I recently wore them on an international flight—over 10 hours!—and I barely felt the need to adjust them. They come with four sizes of ear tips, which gave me options to find the perfect snug fit. However, the minimalist vibe isn’t just for show; it’s practical. Tucking them into a pocket? No problem.  

**Sound Quality**  
The sound quality is where things start to really impress. These earbuds boast an ultra-hearing dual-driver setup, and honestly, I could tell. Bass notes have a satisfying depth, but the highs remain crisp without that harsh tinniness. Listening to rock felt just as vibrant as slower acoustic songs. That triple adaptive EQ? It’s like having a sound engineer adjusting the music in real time. Whether I was pacing the living room, lying on a couch, or jogging, these tiny marvels adapted to my movements and locked a well-balanced audio output consistently. Still, I did notice one thing—it performs best with earbuds inserted properly; even the smallest misplacement can affect the bass punch.  

**Positives**  
- Exceptional comfort, even for extended use  
- Rich and balanced audio tuned by the dual-driver technology  
- Adaptive EQ ensures consistent sound quality across activities  

[Check HUAWEI Piano-T100 FreeBuds Pro 3 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0cjx9h18h/)  

**Active Noise Cancellation and Call Features**  
As a commuter and coffee-shop worker, ANC is non-negotiable for me. The intelligent ANC 3.0 in these earbuds blew my expectations out of the water. Huawei’s tri-microphone hybrid noise cancellation system identified rumbling engines, chatty passengers, and even high-pitched interruptions with precise accuracy. During calls, the Pure Voice 2.0 feature made a big difference. It uses bone conduction voice pick-up, which basically means your voice transmission stays clear, even in noisier places. It felt like a small boost to my professional demeanor during client calls. That said, ANC does consume battery a little faster than I hoped on long days.  

**Battery Life and Case Convenience**  
Battery life on these buds is nothing short of solid. The advertised 31 hours with the case definitely holds up with moderate use. I’ve stretched multiple days of music, calls, and podcasts before needing a recharge. Charging via the wireless case is quick—just 40 minutes to juice it fully. No cable? No problem, as wireless charging swoops in to save the day. My only nitpick: While the case design is slim, it’s plastic. A metal finish here would’ve paired better with the premium feel of the earbuds themselves.  

**Shortcomings**  
- More premium materials could elevate the case design  
- ANC noticeably drains the battery faster during extended use  

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing these buds with other popular options like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM4, I found some interesting distinctions. Huawei’s dual-driver approach outpaces Apple’s depth of sound, particularly with bass-heavy genres. However, the AirPods Pro has smoother overall integration with iOS devices that Huawei can’t quite replicate. Sony’s earbuds lead in ANC performance at extremely low frequencies, but their bulkier design doesn’t sit as comfortably in my ears. On price-to-sound quality, Huawei has a sweet spot, especially with Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification, something its competitors sometimes lack.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For wireless earbuds boasting features like L2HC 2.0 codec support, adaptive noise cancellation, and a total of 31 hours battery life including the case, their price fits snugly in the mid-premium category. Are they the absolute top-tier? No. But for anyone searching for a premium experience without the jaw-dropping thermonuclear pricing of some industry behemoths, this is where Huawei stands tall. It manages to balance affordability and quality.

Featured are Simple Kaffa in Taipei, Taiwan, Puzzle Coffee in Zanzibar, Tanzania, Tanat (formerly Kawa) in Paris, France, and Ssoh from Moshi, Tanzania.

The Ethiopian from Simple Kaffa is a medium-light and tasted very floral with a citrus zest acidity, and is probably my favorite Ethiopian so far this year. I used 90° water as it was not super light.

I was similarly super impressed by the coffee from Ssoh, which is in the small town of Moshi in the Kilimanjaro area of Tanzania. The cafe/roastery is run by a Korean couple, and they buy beans as whole cherries from farms in Tanzania and do the processing at a small scale at the roastery - kind of insane :0. The beans were quite light and I definitely think they will benefit from more rest (currently at 2 weeks), and a finer grind. 

I haven't tried the coffees from Puzzle and Tanat yet, but am eager to try my first Yemeni coffee. The Puzzle coffee is more developed, but smells nice.

A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome!

The app seemed a bit different now. More people actually had bios, and a few even listed what they were really looking for. That was already better than the last time I used it in 2022, where it felt like a silent photo gallery.

Before he came back I made sure the house was spotless. I cleaned every corner of his office. I washed, ironed, and folded his laundry. Before his arrival I prepped my body with love and care. I got my nails done in sexy red. I waxed my whole body. It was smooth and soft ready for his touch.

first of all thank you for this sub / community.
it really helps to read from people who feel and experience somehow similar towards caffeine and have similar goals

today i made it to quit caffeine for 24 hours for the first time after at least a year, as this may not sound a lot, for me, it is a big milestone as i try to quit for so long now and it seems that i cannot do it with pure willpower as my mind seems not to be open for any kind of tricks anymore, so i really try to do this withdrawal as conscious as possible with all bad things going through

what has helped me lately:
- reading this sub constantly 
- reading alan carrs book ""easy way to quit caffeine"" again 
 - roibos tea with milk / cream
 - from the above book:
 - do not envy caffeine drinkers
 - do not mourne caffeine
 - accept there are good and bad days, everyone has them, this has nothing to do with caffeine
 - drinking another coffee is not ""only one"" it is a lifetime decision, a cycle

these tips from the book of alan carr helped a lot as i tended to envy and mourne when i saw people with coffees in public / around me

also the fact that there are good and bad days and you just need to go through them helped a lot, although I read this so many times before, now it kind of made ""click"" for me as I realized that I need to go through my emotions and bad days and not hide them and / or push me with coffee, even if this means i need to go through long and bad times, but otherwise those won't solve out at all

maybe this helps someone here, and if not today maybe at some time later, as for me it is a journey - a hard one but also kind of beautiful one, a journey to myself",1,1754161052.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Lonely but full of love. 

Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn’t meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm based in Italy, currently visiting Germany and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 181cm, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

1mfy871,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mfy871/does_the_best_electric_tea_kettle_from_bella_live/,Does the best electric tea kettle from BELLA live up to the buzz?,"The BELLA 14753 Electric Tea Kettle caught my eye because of its stylish copper chrome finish and promises of both speed and safety. Living in a household where tea is a daily ritual, I was genuinely excited to give this kettle a thorough test. Over the past few weeks, it’s become an integral part of my kitchen routine, but this journey hasn’t been entirely perfect. There’s a lot to love here, with some quirks that might make or break it for certain users.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
One of the standout features is its stunning copper chrome exterior. If you’re someone who appreciates a sleek and modern kitchen aesthetic, this electric kettle will fit seamlessly into your space. Beyond its looks, the design is practical with a 360-degree swivel base that makes it easy to pour from any angle. The gooseneck-style spout ensures precision for tasks like brewing pour-over coffee or filling small cups without splashes. I get compliments from guests every time I use it because it looks much more expensive than it is. However, the shiny chrome finish tends to pick up fingerprints, so if you like spotless surfaces, you’ll find yourself wiping it down quite often.  

**Pros**  
- Stylish copper finish enhances kitchen décor.  
- Gooseneck spout guarantees controlled, safe pouring.  
- 360-degree swivel base with cord storage adds convenience.  

[Ready for BELLA 14753? Check the Amazon price here.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07hrq9bq6/)

**Performance and Speed**  
The 1500-watt heating element means water boils in record time. I tested it against a microwave and stovetop, and the kettle won every time, taking just under five minutes to boil a full 1.7-liter capacity. This speed is incredibly useful when you’re rushing in the morning. The concealed heating element, combined with boil-dry protection, guarantees safety during operation—a real relief if you tend to multitask while brewing your tea. It’s quieter than other kettles I’ve tried, which is especially nice during early mornings when everyone else is still asleep.  

**Benefits**  
- Rapid boiling beats traditional methods.  
- Boil-dry protection adds to safety.  
- Operates quietly, perfect for shared households.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Using the kettle is a breeze—just fill, flip the switch, and wait. The indicator light conveniently signals when it’s in operation, but I wished it turned off after heating was complete for clarity. The wide mouth makes it easy to clean, but since it’s not dishwasher safe (only hand wash recommended), you’ll need to clean it manually. Overall, the maintenance requirements aren’t bad, though mineral buildup can be tricky if you use hard water without regular descaling.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Not dishwasher-friendly—handwashing is a must.  
- Fingerprints are easily visible on the chrome surface.  

**Key Features and Practicality**  
What really impressed me about this electric kettle was its thoughtful features. The automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection offer peace of mind, especially when my forgetful mornings come into play. The cord storage beneath the base helps reduce countertop clutter—no more messy wires! With its durable transparent design, I can monitor the water level at a glance, making it both practical and user-friendly.  

**Competitors in the Market**  
When stacked against competitors like the Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle or the Cuisinart PerfecTemp, this kettle shines in terms of design and portability. While the Hamilton Beach option has a lower price range, it lacks the aesthetic appeal of the BELLA version. Cuisinart’s model, on the other hand, offers temperature controls for tea customization but comes at nearly double the cost. For daily, straightforward use with a touch of flair, the BELLA 14753 hits a sweet spot.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its features and design, this kettle provides a lot of value for its price. While it doesn’t have premium features like adjustable temperature settings, it still offers great bang for the buck with rapid boiling, safety mechanisms, and its eye-catching style. If you’re looking for an affordable yet functional kettle, this one is hard to pass up.

1mfy7d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mfy7d9/im_a_summer_camp_lifeguard_and_someone_wants_me/,"I’m a summer camp lifeguard, and someone wants me to drown the kids.","The town of Spectral Lakes is known for the glut of ghost stories choking the annals of our history. You can’t enter a single gift shop, motel, or museum without gaudy flyers advertising our “ghost tours” being shoved into your periphery on every kiosk.

Most of the stories are relegated to Lake Spectral, the biggest of the town’s lakes, but I’ve always felt a much deeper connection to Lullaby Lake, mostly because my Uncle Chung-Ho (all names in this story changed for privacy) ran the summer camp there, and I lived near it for my whole childhood.

But after my brother was born, dad got a job in Seattle, and we moved away for a while, only returning after I was sixteen.

The small town now thoroughly bored me. Staying at home wasn’t an option. Dad was always at work and mom moved back to Korea. So, having nothing better to do, my brother Ken was like a little gnat hovering around my head. Always asking me stupid questions or just generally invading my personal space.

I needed a summer job, and the local ‘haunted’ roller rink wasn’t hiring. Uncle Chung-Ho threw me a lifeline, though. Offered to let me be a lifeguard for the late afternoon shift. Even let me stay in a cabin in the camp so I could be my own man.

There were ghost stories about Lullaby, of course. Before I’d moved away there were rumors floating around school about kids who walked into the lake to find lost toys and then, themselves, became lost. When thinking back on those stories at the time, I wondered if it was a way to warn kids about the dangers of the lake. Drowning deaths weren’t uncommon in a lakeside town.

The first few weeks of the job were easy. The kids who grow up around the lakes already know how to swim, so I only really had to worry about the visitors.

A couple kids needed help sometimes. Nothing serious took place. A few fights over toys resulted in tears, and I had to break up violent water gun battles, but it was a chill experience overall.

I even got to spend an almost intoxicating amount of time with the other lifeguard, Bethany, without my kid brother trying to butt in. She was another Spectral Lakes native. Once, when I was on-duty, she hung out with me despite her shift being over. I kept fidgeting with my whistle as she talked and scarcely dared to look at her blue-green eyes.

“You’re lucky you started this year. Last year sucked bad,” she said. She pulled at her black pony-tail.

I watched a couple kids try to climb up on the giant log bobbing against the rope marking off the safe swimming area. They managed to gain holding on the slippery surface before the log slowly rotated, sending the kids laughing and splashing to their doom.

“What happened?” I asked. The whistle’s lanyard was tight around my fingers.

“A kid drowned. Snuck in after hours on a dare.” She adjusted herself on the wood camp chair. The peeling paint stuck to the bottoms of her forearms. “The morning lifeguard found him. He quit after.”

“Oh.” My finger went white, its circulation cut off. I untangled it from the lanyard. “Must have been awful to see.”

A few kids on the shore were trying to skip rocks, but kept throwing them way too close to the swimming area. I blew the whistle and got them to stop.

“Yeah. He told me the kid must have died the night before, but something was really weird about the body.”

I took a tentative glance at her. Her eyes looked far off, past the pine trees on the other side of the lake.

“What?” I asked.

“There were bruises around his ankles. Police said that his feet must have gotten tangled in debris.” A mosquito buzzed near her thigh. She didn’t seem to notice. “But that lifeguard told me they looked more like hand marks.”

“Chung-Ho never told me,” I said, brows raised. 

She shrugged. “Didn’t wanna scare you off, prolly.” She smiled at me. It was simple, almost put-on in order to lighten the mood. But still. I glanced away from her, cheeks red. 

It was good that I did. I noticed something. 

A blur of orange lurked under the water, near the border rope. A few brown fingers showed their tips above the surface before sinking down.

I jumped from the tower, grasping my rescue buoy and diving into the lake.

I grabbed at the orange blur before me, fingers closing in on swimsuit material. I got a grip around a small arm with my other hand and dragged it up to the surface.

The kid emerged in a huff. I propped her up on the buoy and quickly towed her to land. She hacked up the water in her lungs, thankfully not having enough in there that she needed any more help with.

The other kids stopped what they were doing and watched with mouths agape.

“Mr. Noah? Is she okay!?” asked a friend of hers.

“HA! Katie can’t swim!” jeered one of the asshole kids.

Katie’s red eyes bloomed with scared tears. 

“You okay?” I asked.

“My Barbie’s gone… I dropped her and tried to get her back. She’s gone forever!” Before a fresh batch of wails erupted from her.

I looked down. Could have sworn her ankles looked red, too. But before I could get a better look, Bethany descended on her, waves of comforting words coming from her lips as she put an arm ‘round Katie’s shoulder.

”Do you want a Sonic popsicle? I got one in the freezer,” offered Bethany.

Katie wiped at her red eyes and gave a nod as she wheezed.

I reported the incident to her parents and my Uncle. After what felt like hours of my Uncle and I calming down her hysterical mother over the phone, it was twilight on the lake. I went to my little cabin (which wasn’t much more than a small bedroom and bath), and slipped out of my swim trunks.

”Oh, shit,” I said as I put my lifeguard gear away. 

My whistle was missing. It was a cheap little thing, but Uncle Chung-Ho was cheap about replacing stuff. I walked back out to the lake to comb the shore for it, but it was getting real dark and I figured I’d just find it in the morning, so I stopped.

After dinner, I settled into bed and felt a wave of exhaustion overtake me. I got a text from Ken about how he ate Takis that day and liked them. For some reason he kept using my dad’s phone to update me on random things.

Usually I’d play gatcha games or something before I slept, but I could barely keep my eyes open, so I just let myself drift off.



\---



I felt cold water all around me. My eyes seemed frozen shut, so my body just floated in blackness for a while.

I kicked my legs, hoping to get my head above water, but I had no idea where I was going, and there was something wet and slimy curled around my ankle. I screamed in surprise. Even after kicking vigorously, it just stayed firmly in place, as if it’d been tied there to anchor me to the lakebed. 

Lakebed. That was it. It must be a lake plant, and if it was, it was growing from the bed. So the opposite direction would be my ticket out of the water.

I tried to calm myself and bend down to pull away the weeds, but knew my breath wasn’t going to last much longer. My heartbeat thumped in my ears. The rubbery weed was tough to tear through, and my fingers refused to bend right in the cold. I kept trying to force my eyes to open, but they wouldn’t. The darkness grew more oppressive as air leaked from my lungs.

I felt around for the body of the weed and pulled myself down it like a reverse climbing rope. The sandy lakebed was under my fingertips. My nails dug into the roots, grains getting stuck under them. I tried planting my feet on the sand and pulling it out, but nothing seemed to work.

Things were getting desperate now. The more effort I used, the more breath left my body. The water around me started to feel like a vice pushing and crushing me inward even as my nerves numbed. My joints started to refuse my brain’s orders. I grew listless, consciousness fading. I begin to feel impossible things in my last moments.

I thought I could smell my mom’s cooking. But it was just water pouring into my nose. I heard her laugh. But it was just bubbles rushing into my ears and bloodstream.

In the still waves, my limp body floated for minutes. I thought I was dead. But I still heard a weak heartbeat through it all. Every pulse of blood in my limbs felt like a needle jamming life into a block of ice.

Something touched me. It was almost like hair. Or one of those sheer fabrics that people use to wrap bouquets. The thing gently washed across my shin, then again at my feet. Then it was gone. And I heard my whistle.

I knew it was my whistle, because my brother had banged it up and it never sounded quite right after that. But there it was, its sound echoing through the water. And that sound, somehow, got me to move.

I could move. It was impossible, but I could, despite my body being weighed down by the lake’s water that now filled it. The weed relaxed, freeing my leg. And next, I finally could open my eyes.

It was still extremely dark, but I could make out some of what was around me. I saw the awful weed that’d trapped me here. I saw the lakebed scattered with plantlife and litter. And at my feet was the most surprising thing. The toy Katie had lost.

It was a Barbie doll with a fabric mermaid tail. The fins must have been what brushed me earlier. Her painted face looked up at me, smile wide but eyes sad, like she missed her owner.

I picked her up. Despite the exceptionally more serious situation I was currently in, I somehow felt like I needed to return her to Katie. She didn’t want to be here.

The whistle screamed again. I turned my head to face the sound. It came from deeper in the lake. The lakebed curved downward into a darker valley.

I decided to follow the whistle. 

My lungs were full of water, and my feet walked on the lakebed like I was a spaceman on the surface of Mars. So clearly, this was a dream. Why should I worry about getting to the surface now? May as well see where this goes.

I tread through the ice-cold environment. The valley went deeper and deeper, through areas the moonlight struggled to pierce. Still, I wandered, guided by that eerie sound. 

To the left I saw an old toy diving ring. To my right, a sunk fishing dinghy. I stepped on a broken bottle as I walked, cursing to myself. My words were garbled as bubbles erupted from my mouth. A trail of blood floated up from my heel. Still, I kept walking.

Soon it was too dark to see. I stopped then. The full brunt of what was happening here was at the edge of crashing down on my psyche. 

A light was visible in the distance. Cold and blue. 

I walked toward it. 

I heard the whistle again. It was followed by a choir of whispering laughs.

Dark shapes were outlined in the light. Man-made structures. I couldn’t make them out yet…

The Barbie in my hand hadn’t changed expression, it was a doll, I told myself. But somehow, she looked scared. It’s stupid to admit, but I hugged her close to give myself even an ounce of comfort as that blue light grew brighter.

Amongst those dark shapes, I thought I saw something white moving. Flitting from one shape to the other. I strained my eyes to see more, but my sight, despite the light getting brighter, was blurring more and more.

The feeling of drowning began to overtake me again. I clutched the doll as I bent forward. I coughed violently, as if trying to hack the whole lake out of my lungs.

Darkness pressed in on my vision. The whistle’s cry cut off prematurely.

The last thing I saw before blackness overtook me was a white face highlighted in blue.



\---



I woke up with a lot more coughing. It felt like it took a half hour before I could properly breathe again. My bed was soaked, like I’d sweated out all the soda I’d drank yesterday. 

When I got the chance to look up, I noticed my door was unlocked. I quickly locked it and stumbled to the bathroom.

What a terrible night. I shoved my bedsheets into a bag. They really needed to be washed.

I walked out of my cabin and headed for the laundry. The lake was as beautiful as ever in the morning light, but I felt a sudden aversion when looking at it that I’d never experienced before.

Yawning, I continued down the shoreline in my sandals (which I could hardly feel with how numb my feet were), when a speck of hot pink caught my eye. 

A mermaid Barbie perched on the sand. Water lapped up at her fins. She smiled, her stiff plastic arms pointed up at the sky.

And beside her, almost dissolved amongst the sand, were bloody footprints leading out of the water.

I looked down at my foot. Blood had pooled at the bottom of my sandal.



\---



I didn’t want to go to my shift that day. I used the first aid station to patch up my cut foot, but I kept shivering whenever I caught even a glimpse of the lake now.

Of course, I didn’t tell Uncle Chung-Ho the real reason I didn’t wanna do it. I just blamed it on my injury.

”Well you can still walk, can’t you?” He said to me while I nervously stood in his office. “You can use your eyes? You can swim?” He gave me a look.

I shrugged.

”I could have used that cabin of yours to store more tubes. Now I gotta keep them in the cafe. You know how hard it is for me to make coffee when there’s 50 giant rubber inflatable donuts in there?”

”You said that kids don’t want coffee anyway, so the cafe’s only needed for the adult camp season.”

”Yeah, and who in here’s an adult?” He gave me another look as he pointedly unscrewed the lid of his thermos and took a long gulp of decaf. He wiped his chin and raised his brows. ”The least you can do for me is do your job with a little cut on your foot.”

”Yeah, yeah…” My eyes fixed themselves on the patchy carpet before I dared to speak the next words. “But... you know... hazard pay would be nice...”

Chung-Ho glared at me with the concentrated power only an uncle could. “Noah. Remember what happened right before you moved away?”

I shrugged, trying to figure out where this was going.

“The fancy playground I’d just bought went missing! The whole thing! I got it with a loan I’m still trying to pay off. Now you want to get paid? You don’t want me to go bankrupt, do you?”

I shrugged again, regretting saying anything about getting paid. The memory of that incident came back to me now. On reflection, it was really weird. The whole playground was stolen, the only bits remaining being some leftover screws and wagon wheel tracks that went straight into the lake. Police said there was only evidence of a singular thief, and that he’d worked through the night disassembling it and bringing the pieces onto a boat.

“No, Uncle Chung-Ho. I don’t want that. I was just joking.”

“Jokes should be funny, Noah.”

I walked out of his office, wincing even as I stepped lightly. 



\---



Already feeling sufficiently emasculated by the way I’d hugged that doll last night, I was desperate to hide my trembling when I took over Bethany’s shift later that day.

I failed.

”You alright, Noah?” She asked, looking me up and down after she’d descended the lifeguard tower.

”It’s kind of cold today, huh?” I responded, pressing my shivering hands to my sides.

”Not… really.” Bethany unwrapped a fresh popsicle, which was already dripping.

“Princess Seafoam!!” A sudden squeal mercifully ended the conversation. Katie spotted the Barbie poking out of my tote and immediately gave the doll what would have been a bone-breaking hug if it had been alive.

“Uh, yeah. I found it on the beach this morning,” I said, shifting my weight away from my cut foot.

”THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!” Said Katie, who jumped up and down. She wore her campground clothes, not her swimsuit. Probably not in the mood to get into Lullaby. I sympathized. 

“If you hadn’t saved her, she was gonna get taken by the weeds!” Katie said, shaking her head and petting the doll’s hair.

Weeds? I wondered, heart thumping. “What do you mean?”

“Lullaby weeds take toys down deep.” she said matter-of-factly. “Maybe the lake likes to play with them. I dunno.”

Before I could ask anything else, she ran off towards her cabin.

”Good on ya. That mermaid coulda drowned.” Bethany said. My shivers ceased as I looked at her warm smile. I climbed up the lifeguard tower with a salute.

There were a lot of kids out today. Coupled with the fear from last night’s... dream, it made the job much more stressful than usual. My whistle being gone, I almost lost my voice from yelling so much. My eyes kept darting from kid to kid, trying to make sure every head dipped underwater for a normal amount of time.

Bethany decided to stay with me again. I liked the company. But when she talked with me or tried to show me some videos on her phone, I kept my eyes on the water.

There was even a moment when she reached up and tugged on my trunks to get my attention, then offered me a Powerpuff Girls popsicle. I just smiled and accepted it without turning my head.

It took all my strength to keep this up, but I couldn’t let myself get distracted. Whenever I glanced away from the swimmers, my thoughts flashed back to the feeling of water surging up my nostrils and the heaviness that came with waterlogged lungs. I imagined finding the bodies of children floating up to the surface.

Shit. There. A kid way out was bobbing his head out of the water silently, barely able to gasp as he desperately whirled his arms.

Bethany immediately followed my gaze and leapt to her feet.

Before I could move, she said: “I got this. You played the hero yesterday.” She grabbed my rescue buoy and made a graceful dive into the water. 

I called everyone out of the lake. A mass of kids gave disappointed signs and made their way to the shore.

In the span of several tense seconds, Bethany swam over to the drowning kid. But before she could reach him, he sank under the water and didn’t come back up. Bethany saw him go down and took a deep breath, following after him.

Seconds passed.

And then more.

Then more. 

Something was wrong. I jumped forward, but somehow my trunks had caught fast on a nail head. My body lurched down, the threads broke, and I painfully landed at the base of the lifeguard tower. My shoulder ached. For a second I wondered if it was dislocated. I spat sand out of my mouth and stumbled to my feet before managing a beeline towards the water.

My shoulder crying in protest, I swam as fast as I could to the spot both of them had disappeared. 

Just before I went down, Bethany breached the water, gasping and sputtering. Her face was awash in fear.

“I can’t find him!”

I pulled goggles over my eyes and dove. Terror sunk its claws into me as the water overtook my head. I tried my best to push it all away as I frantically searched for the boy.

He’d been wearing black swim trunks, which were frustratingly hard to spot in a lake.

I went deeper until I found the silty bottom.

There. In the weeds.

A pale face shone between the green strands. Small bubbles of air burbled from its open mouth. Its lips were blue.

Muscles aching for air, I tore through the weeds until the boy’s small body was free. Propping him under my arm, I propelled myself off of the lakebed and shot towards the surface.

The next few minutes were some of the worst of my life.

Bethany called for Uncle Chung-Ho and the ambulance. While we waited for help, it was up to us to get this kid breathing again.

We’d screamed at the kids on the shore to go back to their cabins, but they didn’t move, just staring in horror at their friend’s blue skin.

CPR training forced itself to the front of my mind. All of my energy went into compressions. I didn’t want to break the kid’s sternum, but the water just wasn’t coming out.

I sang to myself, using it to keep time on the compressions while calming my own heart from stopping.

Every second felt agonizing.

His eyes didn’t move under his lids.

This was my fault.

I hadn’t been paying enough attention.

I was so overtaken by fear that I almost didn’t notice when he started coughing.

The kid retched out dirty lake water, turning on his side as bile burst from his throat and onto the warm dirt.

Seeing the color return to his face, I started to cry.



\---



My uncle congratulated me warmly. He was proud I’d saved another kid’s life.

I felt cold. Two close calls in a row was two too many.

Bethany didn’t talk much after the kid was handed over to EMTs. I could tell she was in a shock. Probably felt horrible that she had almost let him drown. She went home looking pale.

As I got back into my cabin’s bed, the sheets now clean and dry, I rubbed my sore shoulder while I waited for the pain meds to kick in. 

I wondered if it was possible for me to sleep after all that had happened. I slipped out of bed to make sure my door was locked. I stood there for a moment. Looked out my windows at the lake.

I closed the blinds.

My phone buzzed.

“wow im playing mario now. hes cool. i like the turtles -Ken” 

How much access did Dad let this kid have to his phone, anyway?

The rest of my messages were filled with notifications for new events in my gatcha games, so I tried to get my mind off of things by playing them a bit. But while my character rode around in search of pngs to gamble for, I soon slipped out of consciousness, the relaxing music taking me deep into the fathoms below.



\---



That blue light again.

I saw it before me. 

I was back under the waves, toes dug into the sand of the lakebed, standing right where I’d drifted off the night before. The sudden feeling of water seeping through every nook and cranny of my being flooded my senses.

I shuddered, which caused ripples of water to disturb the sand, pushing it back in gentle eddies.

The whistle sounded again. Much closer. The blue light and blackened shapes beckoned.

So I walked towards them. One plodding step at a time. And then, the shapes finally crystallized into identifiable architecture.

This was a little town. Well, not an actual sunken town. I’d seen pictures of those on the internet before and they were a lot bigger than this. Made up of normal buildings. This was something different. It almost looked like it’d been built here. Under the water. Not flooded.

There were several small buildings. Some with doorways barely taller than my legs. And all of them were ramshackle. Structures made of driftwood hammered together with clumsy hands. The biggest ‘buildings’, if you could call them that, were made from the hulls of upside-down boats. A few were modern speedboats and the like, but a lot were much older. Like an 1800s logging raft. Or a fishing dinghy. Doorways were carved out of them, and they were all decorated in some form or fashion.

One little hut had tiny shells stuck around the doorframe. Smooth large stones made for tiny pathways between houses. Another structure was lined with fishing nets braided into curious patterns. The bones of various fish stuck out of a boat’s hull like a gruesome mohawk.

Some of these buildings had large, misshapen balloon-like things tied to them, which floated a distance from the light so I couldn’t make out exactly what they were.

Lost toys were placed around as if this was their home. An old porcelain doll covered in lake moss stood at a shop counter as if she was preparing to sell her wares. Her hair floated in a cloud around her but the lack of a current made it as still as a picture.

I saw plastic construction toys near one hut. Broken G.I. Joes stuck in the sand like a battalion ready to shoot me. A chipped tea set with a lake crab curled under a teacup.

The source of the blue light was a large old fisherman’s lantern. The kind that’d be used to ward sailors from the lakeshore at night.

It illuminated the centerpiece of the little town. A playground. This was the only piece that wasn’t makeshift. It was a whole Costso playground with a slide and everything that was somehow sunk in the middle of the lake. 

This was Uncle Chung-Ho’s.

I started when I realized that someone was inside it.

Tiny white hands gripped the bars. I couldn’t identify the face of their owner. It was wreathed in darkness. A pink beaded bracelet circled one wrist.

My heartbeat was in my ears. Water clogged my throat. I tried to speak. No bubbles came forth this time. There wasn’t any air left in my lungs to produce them.

“Who--are--?” I managed. But I sounded too garbled to be anywhere understandable.

The hands moved. Slowly, they uncurled from the playground bars and slunk back into the gloom. Then, with a kind of unsteady, waving motion, one hand appeared again under the blue light.

It held my whistle.

I breathed lake water in and out. Each breath was longer and more painful than any on land. I stepped closer to the hand, though every nerve told me to run away. Where would I run to? This was a dream. It had to be. I needed to find out who was haunting it.

My fingers touched the ice-cold metal of the whistle.

The hand didn’t move. I couldn’t pull the whistle from its frozen fingers. And the closer I looked at them, the more I could see that they were swollen.

The hand pulled itself closer to its body. I was moved with it. A face appeared in the gloom, motes of silt floating about the dead skin.

All I could do was watch while bloated, misshapen lips pulled themselves over small teeth as a whispering girl’s voice pried itself in the folds of my brain.

“Stop saving them.”



\---



I awoke at the edge of the lake. 

It was just before dawn. The lake was completely quiet. I stood there for a moment, in shock, watching the water crawl up to touch my feet, as if beckoning me back down with it. Up... and back... up... and...

In the early morning light, it was hard to discern anything. But I started to see little shapes in the waves, gently swaying with the tide, bobbing up and pulling me back.

They looked like children’s fingers.

I staggered back from the shoreline as the full brunt of everything I’d been through hit me. I threw up silty water, my stomach’s contents making a mess of the beach chairs beside my cabin.

“S-son of a bitch...” I said between retches. 

All the water was finally out of my body, but I still felt the slimy pond algae mucking up my throat and nose. I retreated into my cabin and drank a few cans of soda to try and wash it down, then gargled a bottle of mouthwash. I showered and scrubbed every last part of myself I could find.

I still felt nasty inside. I sensed silt inside the crannies of my bloodstream. Sand in between the joints of my bones. It was like the lake itself had infected me totally.

I sat in the corner of my room next to my heater, my blanket pulled over my shivering body. Nothing warmed me up.

The hands of the clock ticked by. Lunchtime was coming soon. The first group would be heading to the lake for free time after they ate, where Bethany would watch them.

I thought of the whispered words I’d heard last night, and burst out of my cabin, heading for my Uncle’s office.

It took several lies to get him to shut down swimming that day. I insisted I’d seen teenagers sneak onto the property and throw used needles onto the beach. I also reasoned it was a good idea to keep the kids out of the water for now, out of respect for the incidents yesterday.

My uncle agreed, and announced the news over the PA system to the disappointment of the kids. He was impressed with my maturity, he said.

I didn’t feel noble. Just scared. 

Uncle told me he’d ask the janitors to take care of things when they came tonight. Didn’t know what I’d say to him when they didn’t find anything. How would I keep this up for even a few more days? Would I have to pollute the lake myself?

I said my goodbyes and started back to my cabin. 

On the way, I saw Bethany walk away from the lake dressed in her lifeguard swimsuit and a pair of sweatpants. I caught her eye and she sidled up to me.

”Bummer about the lake. We’re still gonna get paid, right?” she asked.

“You are. I get paid with food and shelter.”

”Is that legal?”

”According to family law.”

She chuckled. But I could tell her heart wasn’t in it. She looked distracted. 

“By the way. Since you’re not doing anything right now…”

I stood up straight, my fingers tangling up with one another.

”…Could you do something for me?”

”What?”

”I need to restock the popsicle freezer. Your uncle doesn’t want to bother with it right now. But you’ve seen how much the kids like it. I mean, a dessert freezer right by the lake? It’s just so perfect, right, Noah?”

I gave a half-smile. “Is this request really for the kids, or just you?”

”Come on. I’ll pay you back.” She grinned. “Chung-Ho wants me to stay on-site even if I’m not ‘working’.”

I didn’t have a reason to stay at the camp anyway. The kids wouldn’t be swimming. Plus, getting away from it felt like a good idea, if only to try and stay sane. No excuses, I suppose…

”Alright. I’ll be back later.”

Bethany beamed. “Cool. And make sure to get SpongeBob ones.”

”Aye aye, captain.”

I didn’t have a car, but Spectral Lakes was small, so walking wasn’t a challenge. But my foot still ached, and it took about a half hour to get to the nearest crummy corner store. I leisurely scanned the shelves looking for ugly cartoon popsicles.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I took it out and glanced at the screen.

”See u soon! -Ken”

My head tilted in confusion. What did he mean? I didn’t remember plans for him to come to the camp today.

Might have been a mistake. Or an old text that finally went through. I picked out a bunch of popsicles and swept them into my basket. I then was faced with the dilemma of how I was gonna keep them from melting in the long walk back. Hm. I added a bundle of ice to the order. Then a cooler. Then despaired at the state of my finances.

That’s when another text came.

”ur not here :( o well. beth is waching me -Ken”

Okay, so that first text wasn’t a mistake. Something about this made me start to feel nervous. My brother was at camp being watched specifically by a lifeguard, not one of the counselors. I didn’t like the sound of that. Did my dad drop him off with my uncle? If so, he wouldn’t be swimming today, right? Even if Bethany was watching him, she knew the lake was closed. She wouldn’t break the rules.

I tried to shake off my anxiety, but it wouldn’t go. The shivering feeling from yesterday started again. I had to go back. Now.

I left my filled up basket at the door to the chagrin of the shopkeeper and ran down the road towards the camp. 

Why was it so far away?

As I sprinted, the cut on my foot opened up again. My footsteps trailed blood as I went, but I didn’t care. My panic was rising and drowning out every other feeling.

One car stopped when it saw me and a concerned woman poked her head out the window, asking if I was okay. I managed to convince her to drive me to the camp, insisting it was an emergency.

She nodded, shocked, and we drove the remaining five minutes. She asked if she needed to call 911, but I told her it was a family matter.

I made a beeline for the lakeside. My head swiveled around like an owl as I tried to find Ken. I didn’t see him or Bethany anywhere.

My trembling fingers tried to type on my phone.

”Ken, where are you?”

My dad texted back: “I dropped him off with your friend Bethany. They’re going for a swim.”

My heart dropped.

I looked out on the water. The swimming area was empty, save for a single toy floating on the surface. Ken’s boat.

I waded into the water. This was something I’d done the past few nights, even if I hadn’t been conscious of it.

I knew where Ken was. I had to go get him.

My fingers pierced the water as I dove. I went deeper and deeper, pressure popping my ears. The lake that was inside me felt like it responded to being back in the water. Currents carried me to the lakebed. Air bubbled out of me. The lake took over, and darkness encompassed my mind.



\---



I stood where I’d appeared last night. A good distance away from the underwater town. The blue light remained there like a star in the deep lake. I charged forward through the muck, my steps disturbing the silt and flinging it up into the stillness.

I thought I could hear something in the town ahead. A choir of whispers. A giggle.

My muscles strained against the pressure as I urged them to go faster. I almost stepped on that broken bottle again. Biting my lip, I picked it up and hid it behind my back.

As the forms of the little buildings finally came into focus, I saw something that made my blood run even colder.

In front of the sunken playground was Bethany. She had a smile on her face and sat cross-legged on the lakebed. A teacup touched her lips as she mimed drinking from it. Her eyes looked almost glazed over.

It was horrifying. But the thing she played with was even more so.

Across from Bethany sat the corpse of a little girl. It was wrapped in lakeweed, which drifted about her swollen white face like tendrils of living hair. Her eyes were gone, picked clean by lake scavengers. Flesh sloughed off of her body like smeared dough. 

What was left of her mouth pulled into a mockery of a smile. A giggle traveled through the water as her adipocere-laced hands poured ‘tea’ into Bethany’s cup.

”Where’s Ken!?” I screamed at the two of them as best I could. Somehow my words carried in the water, despite my empty lungs. It almost felt like the lake itself carried my intention.

Bethany and the corpse’s heads turned to face me, wreathed in cold blue light.

“He’s not ready to play yet.” Bethany said. She stood up and placed herself in front of the corpse protectively.

”Bethany, what—what are you doing?”

She was quiet.

”I need my brother! Where IS HE?” I yelled.

Bethany’s ponytail spread out around her head in the gloom. It almost looked like a dark halo.

”My sister is lonely,” she said simply.

For the first time, I noticed, even through the layers of decomposition, that her and the corpse shared several traits. The black hair, the sharp brows, and… matching beaded bracelets.  

“How long has she been down here?” I whispered.

The corpse’s vacant eye sockets stared at me.

”We’re twins,” was all Bethany said.

I thought I could feel tears on my face, but the only indication of their existence was a bit of salt in the thousands of gallons of freshwater around me.

”Please. Where’s Ken?” I begged.

“He’s staying. He doesn’t want to leave. It’s nice here.” Bethany’s face was still.

”Why don’t you stay and keep her company!?” I yelled. “Keep my brother out of it!”

Bethany didn’t answer. Instead, the piercing whisper of the corpse’s words dug into my brain.

“She brings me new friends.”

The sentence sent a violent shiver down my spine. 

In the shadowy doorways of the huts, I glimpsed the wavering, twisting forms of other small bodies. Watching me.

There was a boy with weeds tangling his feet. He carried the handles of a jumprope. A girl with a fish darting between her empty ribs slowly pushed a toy car back and forth. 

The ‘balloons’ I thought I’d seen last night weren’t that at all. The bodies of more children were there, floating upside down with weeds around their necks like a hanging seen from the lake’s reflection. They drifted in the water. Whispered to one another. Used the weed to pull themselves downward to the lakebed like I’d done the first night I’d been drowned. 

They moved silently, all drawing closer to me while hugging toys desperately to their chests as if those were the last bits of humanity left to them.

The freshest body was a boy with a campground wristband on his arm. 

I couldn’t move. Or even think. 

That’s when I heard a whistle blow.

I looked around for the source of the noise. It came from the largest hut, made from the hull of a wooden boat.

I moved past Bethany, who grabbed my wrist and pulled me to face her.

”It’s too late,” she said. “Go home, Noah. Live. I like you.”

Her pale face moved closer to mine. Cold fingers touched my chin. Numb lips closed over my own.

I wrenched out of her grasp, squeezing so hard on her wrist that I heard a ‘crack’ resound in the darkness. She cried out and fell to her knees.

I didn’t look back, charging into the large hut and gasping at the sight within.

Ken lay on a bed of weeds. He was still, eyes bleary, but I could see a whistle tucked between his teeth. 

I hovered over him, my face twisted in pain, looking for any sign of life.

In the perfect stillness of the lake bottom, there were only two things I could hear. My own heartbeat.

And Ken’s.

I hugged him. Then propped him up against my side and swam out of the boat.

Tens of dead eyes watched us. I quickly swam up, kicking my legs as fast as they would go.

Hundreds of little fingers closed in around my vision. I swam harder and harder. The water filling me weighed me down, but my heart gave life, if even a little, and I just outpaced the corpses.

That’s when I felt the weeds begin to wrap themselves around us. The girl’s whisper slunk into my thoughts.

“Please don’t go.”

I wielded the broken bottle like a hunted cat swipes its claws. The glass tore away at the weeds one after the other. In my desperation, I cut my own legs, but it was worth it as we broke free and kept traveling upward.

“Noah...!”

Bethany’s fingers closed around my ankle. I cut them, too.

I only glanced behind me for a second, but in that glimpse, I saw Bethany reach out for me again, and miss, desperately trying to reach us even as her wrist flopped at her side and blood bloomed from her other hand. Her face was twisted in pain and fear.

When the corpses realized that their intended prey was escaping their grasp, they instead moved to the easier prey.

They needed someone to stay with them.

All I heard was a gurgling scream slowly fading away behind me as I swam up.

My brother and I burst from the surface of the lake. We were a good distance from shore, and it took some time for me to finally propel us onto it. The entire time, we got lighter and lighter as we coughed out the lake.

As soon as we touched the dirt, we crawled as far as we could manage before rolling onto our backs, gulping down the precious pine-scented air.

The sight of the sunlight no longer filtered through cold water warmed my shivering body. I turned to look at Ken, who I could tell felt the same. He started to cry, and I hugged him. I patted his back to help him out as the remnants of the depths dribbled from his mouth. Flashbacks of when I burped him as a baby came to mind. That protective feeling of holding my newborn brother mirrored my current emotions as clearly as the reflections on the lake’s surface.

“Thank God, thank God...” I said into his hair as I held him close.

He started to try and speak.

”I f-found your whistle…”

“I know. You did good.”

“I knew it was yours cause I broke it...”

“Yeah. That’s okay.”

“I didn’t wanna be down there.”

“I know. You’re out now. You’ll be okay.”

“They--they didn’t have Takis down there. I think it would have sucked.”

I laughed. “Yeah, buddy. You’re right.”



\---



All I told Uncle Chung-Ho the next day was that I was bored of the job and needed something that paid. He grumbled about it but I was let off the hook. Though, he did ask me a few times if I knew where Bethany went. She wouldn’t answer his calls. I told him I hadn’t heard from her either.

There was an investigation to find her, but nothing ever came up in the years that followed.

Ken doesn’t swim anymore, but besides that, he bounced back from what happened really well. He even started getting real good at biking. Resilience of youth, I guess.

I’m in college now, and decided to study in Korea. Stay with my mom and her family for a while.

Even now I can feel the lake when I’m across the world. I can sense the eddies of the sand move in the ripples of water. I listen to the lapping against the shoreline. Bethany’s laugh when she plays with her sister.

Sometimes I can hear when Ken throws old toys into Lake Lullaby.



He hopes it likes them.

She liked how he always remembered the little things, how she took her coffee (too much sugar, not enough milk), that she hated the sound of Velcro, how she always doodled in her notebooks when she was nervous. He was kind without effort, a little clumsy, always running five minutes late, always apologizing for things that didn’t need apologies. She swore he blushed every time their hands brushed when they walked too close.

She thought maybe, just maybe he liked her back.

Jake knew.

He knew Sarah liked him. He could feel it in the quiet spaces between words, in her hesitant laughter, in the way her gaze would linger just a second longer than normal. She looked at him like she was waiting for something, a sign, a sentence, a confession. And he hated how much it hurt to know he couldn’t give her what she wanted.

Because Jake didn’t like Sarah.

Jake liked Bryan.

He had liked him for a long time. Quietly. Secretly. So secretly that sometimes he almost convinced himself it wasn’t real. He buried it in casual texts, in shared jokes, in moments that looked normal from the outside. But then Bryan would laugh a low, uneven laugh that only happened when he was genuinely surprised by joy and Jake’s chest would ache with something he couldn’t name. Something sharp and warm and impossible.

And he couldn’t tell anyone. Especially not Sarah.

And Bryan?

Bryan liked Sarah.

He liked her in a way that wasn’t loud or flashy. It was steady. Familiar. The kind of affection that grew slowly in inside jokes, in long talks on porches, in shared playlists and glances across crowded rooms. He had thought about telling her once on a cold night, sitting on the curb after a party, passing a can of soda between them and talking about what they’d name their imaginary band.

But Jake was there too.

Lying beside them on the pavement, staring up at the stars like they were supposed to tell him something important. Something secret.

So Bryan didn’t say anything.

And neither did Jake.

And Sarah kept hoping.

Three hearts, drawn in pencil, never quite connecting.

Sarah loved someone who couldn’t love her back. Jake loved someone he wasn’t sure he was allowed to love. Bryan loved someone who wasn’t even looking.

It wasn’t anyone’s fault. No one lied. No one meant to hurt anyone. But it still hurt.

Jake once wrote Bryan’s name in a notebook during math class. Just his name. Over and over. Then he caught himself, panicked, scratched it out, folded the page in half, and tore it out like that could somehow erase the truth.

Sarah once bought Jake his favorite gum from the vending machine. Left it in his locker with a sticky note that said, “Hope this makes you smile :)” Jake smiled. Then he sat down in the bathroom and cried.

Bryan once looked at both of them across the lunch table and wondered if he was the only one who felt lonely in a crowd.

They stayed friends. They still laughed. Still sent each other dumb memes. Still studied together and shared fries and texted late into the night about nothing. Outwardly, nothing broke. But under all of it, the triangle pulsed quiet, constant, wrong.

Each corner leaning toward the wrong one.

And none of them could say the words they really meant.

They were young. Too young, maybe, to untangle all the threads, to name the weight in their chests or the things they were too afraid to say. So they kept going. Kept pretending. Hoping things would shift on their own.

But love even unspoken leaves marks.

It lives in pauses. In glances that last too long. In the ache of what almost was.

And sometimes, in the spaces between laughter, it hurts just enough to remind them what they never said.",1,1754160588.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mfy4s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mfy4s1/does_the_hamilton_beach_40519_coffee_urn_truly/,Does the Hamilton Beach 40519 Coffee Urn Truly Deliver? In-Depth Review,"The Hamilton Beach 40519 Coffee Urn and Hot Beverage Dispenser caught my eye for its promise of accommodating a large crowd while remaining simple to use. This silver, drip-style coffee maker isn’t just about brewing coffee; it’s about ensuring everyone is taken care of at big gatherings. Having tested it extensively at family events, brunches, and even office gatherings, I had plenty of opportunities to evaluate its performance and features. Here’s what I discovered.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing anyone notices is the sleek brushed metal finish. It looks both modern and timeless. Despite regular use, it resists fingerprints and stains, staying presentable even in messy kitchen environments. Cool-to-touch handles and a locking lid give it a safety edge, especially when you’re rushing around serving guests. I also liked that this coffee urn is lightweight at just 4.84 pounds, making it easy to transport from a kitchen counter to a buffet table. However, the overall aesthetic does lean towards functionality more than a wow factor—it’s not a design statement piece, but it blends in well with any environment.

**Capacity and Usefulness for Events**  
With its ability to brew between 15 to 45 cups of coffee, this coffee urn is a savior during large family reunions and parties. I ended up using it for a baby shower with over 30 attendees, and it had no problem keeping up with demand. It’s not restricted to maximum capacity either, which is helpful for smaller gatherings. I also appreciated the water and coffee level window, a small feature that turned out to be super useful for understanding whether it was time to brew a fresh batch.

**Ease of Use and Cup-Activated Spout**  
One-handed dispensing of coffee through the cup-activated spout is a standout feature. Think of it as a no-mess, stress-free serving. I didn’t need to worry about spills while guests used disposable cups or travel mugs. Even my nephew (who’s notorious for spilling anything he touches) managed to get a clean pour. The ready light is another thoughtful addition, ensuring you’re not left guessing about whether the coffee is done brewing. However, I did find myself wishing for a slightly faster brew time as the larger quantities sometimes felt like they took just a tad too long.

**Good Aspects**  
- Sturdy brushed metal exterior resists fingerprints.  
- Cool-touch handles and locking lid for added safety.  
- Flexible brewing capacity from 15 to 45 cups.  
- Water/coffee level window prevents overbrewing.   

**Critiques**  
- Brew times for maximum capacity feel a little lengthy.  
- Aesthetics lean more towards practicality than luxury.  

**Competing Products**  
During my research, I compared it to the West Bend 58002, another popular coffee urn in its class. While the West Bend model is similarly priced and has a broader design appeal, it lacks cool-touch handles and has no locking lid mechanism, which I found indispensable for safety. On the other hand, models like the Elite Gourmet CCM-035 feature rapid brewing but fall short in durability, with complaints of the finish fading after a few uses. What sets this product apart is its dependability and balanced feature set, even if it takes a bit longer to brew.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When stacked up against competing models, the blend of safety, capacity, and design makes this product worth considering. It’s not a luxury kitchen gadget, but you get more than what you’d expect for its accessible price tag. While frequent users or hardcore coffee enthusiasts might look for more high-end solutions, this urn is perfect for casual and occasional use without sacrificing quality.

I honestly feel like I could have handled our ending better and I feel like my lack of boundaries have hurt us both. 

For the sake of being as anonymous as possible all names have been changed and this is a throw away account. This is a long post, but its been a life long friendship that needs context  so apologies in advance. I used the AITA tag just because it felt like it fit he most out of the choices. 

The people involved are myself (F37) my best friend who I will call Connor (M37) and Connor's husband, who I will call Kevin (M36).

Connor and I met in the sixth grade. My parents had decided they didn't want us raised in the city and moved us out to the country.  Connor and I  quickly became friends, the school was very very small. Our graduating class was less than 50 students.  This meant almost everyone's schedules were  nearly identical aside from electives. We had tons in common and just really hit it off. 

Near the end of the sixth grade year we had a funny moment where, Connor came out as gay and I directly after came out as Asexual. The area we lived in was highly conservative for context I am in the US so when I say conservative I mean gun and racist type conservative. Basically MAGA before there was a name for it.  We both agreed to be each others ""beard"" so we could both stay in the saftey of the closet and not be hassled about the ""normal"" teenage dating routine. Basically just staying the best of friends, hold hands on the way to the school bus pick up and if anyone asked of we were dating I would reply yes in the  the most girly tone I could muster. 

This went on for all of middle school and most of high school, we were even voted ""cutest couple"" at the eighth grade promotion. At the start of eleventh grade people started getting suspicious, so we staged a breakup and friendship reconciliation. Really put on a good show and we both had a great laugh after. 

I told everyone who asked me out after that I was just ""not ready to date again"" that I wanted to focus on preparing for college and life after high school. Everyone understood and I managed to avoid the dating world. Connor did find someone to date whole lived in the lager city near by. They were happy and Connor was ""sick with food poisoning"" for our prom, but they managed to go to his boyfriends prom instead as no one from our small town would catch them there. 

There was several other things that happened in high school that really trauma bounded us, some very heavy topics that no one in high school should have to deal with but sadly has become almost normal for US Schools.  I won't go into them in detail as they still affect me but for context the topics include gun violence and the loss of friends we had. 

When we graduated we still stuck together, moved in as roommates for several years, to fast forward a little, I met someone, moved out, put college on hold, then divorced someone, and moved back in. Connor had a couple steady relationships and was really trying to find his one person. While he also navigated family issues. We were at this point closer then just friends, Connor was my brother, my twin and my solid rock. I supported him as he came out to his family and he supported me doing the same. He was there for my divorce and helped me become myself again. I firmly knew that if I lost everything in this world I world at the very least still have Connor and I would be there for him just the same. To be clear, there was no romantic relationship between us but the family type love someone would have for a sibling. Connor was still gay and I despite being married once was still very much Ace. 

One very happy pride Connor met his now husband, we will call him Kevin (M36) I was over the moon for them. They really seemed happy and I also go the news that I could continue my college degree, albeit in another city.  It was sad to leave and we had a whole road trip just for the sake of it before I had to go off to campus. I moved out and Kevin moved in.  

We of course stayed in touch messaging each other with updates of major life events and the usual how've you been texts every so often. I traveled back to visit for their wedding and When I finished my degree both Connor and Kevin made the trip to my graduation and we celebrated.  This was the first time I saw some behavior from Kevin that I didn't like at all. He would nit pick at Connor, nothing relationship ending but small things that made me raise my eyebrows. I said something to Connor and he explained some recent stress they were under. Not wanting to push when I had been gone for so long I let it go. 

After graduation, I had trouble looking for a place to move into. Connor and Kevin offered their spare room to me. They had a house with three bed rooms and said it would help them with the bills and utilities. It was a great deal and I was excited to be moving in. Only things were quite different from when I had lived with Connor before. 

For food, Connor and Kevin bought in bulk and took up just about all of the fridge and storage space. This seems like a small thing but it meant that I had to shop a couple time a week just because if I got more then a couple days of food at a time it wold go bad having no were to be. I also discovered anything that was a treat would get eaten quickly. While annoying  let it go not wanting conflict. I got a mini fridge for my room and this seemed to help the issue. 

I did try to talk to them but they avoided the conversation or teamed up to 'vote' on the issue. When I attempted to talk to Connor about it alone he would agree with me and said he would talk with Kevin and it would be better for a short while but eventually wen't back to the same issue.

I am sure I had some habits they took issue with also, I know I am not the perfect roommate. I leave doors open and lights on, I try my best not too but I do have to admit I am adhd and when I get hyperfocused other things can get blocked out. Hence the lights and doors if I am stuck in focus mode. 

Another day Connor and I went out, we enjoyed a day doing cringy older millennial things. It was just Connor and I as Kevin was at work when we took off. We walked the mall, going in and out of spencers and hot topic. Got fancy coffee and sat in the park. Just doing the relaxed friend thing. When we got back home Kevin was slamming around the kitchen and upset that Connor had done these things with me and not him. I  picked up on the jealous vibe and let them settle things, it wasn't my place and I felt if I tried then it would only make things worse. I wanted a nap anyway. After words, I was softer in my interactions with Kevin after just to not ruffle feathers. (I am very conflict adverse.) 

Kevin insisted on handling all the household bills. This was fine, they were accounts already set up so it made since for them not to change. I gave my portion to Kevin and he paid the bills. One day the power completely went out. Thinking it was an outage I did the usual things, looked outside at the neighbors lights, and checking the outage map on my phone.  It wasn't a power outage, it was just us.

Quickly I went to speak with the guys, I asked if they knew why we lost power and that I checked it was just us. They said they didn't know, Connor looked honestly as confused while Kevin was in and out of the conversation. Seeing we were going in circles I called the power company who of course wouldn't talk with me because it wasn't my account. At this point I had a good idea of what had happened just from the context clues but wanted it confirmed.  

It took some time for both Connor and I to pin Kevin down  but we got him on the phone with the power company. It was confirmed Kevin didn't pay the bill, and hadn't paid for about three months. I was livid and it was one of the few times I blew up and put my foot down. I demanded the online access to the utilites accounts, not just power but all of them. Let them know I would set up payment plans and be checking to make sure they were up to date. It was a large conflict and Kevin left it several times but I eventually got the access I needed. They didn't have the funds so I fronted the reconnecting fee for the power with the agreement that I won't pay that part of the monthly bills until the fronted money was caught up. 

This incident was a large eye opener for me, I couldn't deny Kevin and I just didn't get along and Connor and I had grown more distant in our time apart. We were still friends, and would still be there for each other but there was a new distance. I made the choice to move out, living there had allowed me to save a bit so it was more manageable then before. I found a place and made the move, it was a small two bed room perfect for me, my cat and all my crafty crazyness. 

We still  lived in the same city and Connor and I fell back in the routine we had when I was back in college. Kevin and I didn't really talk at all unless Connor brought him along to an event we were both attending. The big change was Connor and I didn't have friend days like we did before if anything was planned it was planned for three.  

This went on for about a year, and at this point in life I had been doing really well for myself. Connor and I found a balance in our friendship again, while Kevin and I were on low contact.  

Then things went south. Connor came to me one day to let me know they were losing the house, they had only a month to find a place. I listened and I wanted to be there for Connor, so I offered my second bedroom to them. I knew this would also mean accepting Kevin back in but I didn't want them becoming homeless. Connor declined. They wanted to leave the city and move to a more liberal area which I completely understood. 

They moved and I lost contact for several months aside from small vague updates. Until one day Connor messaged asking if the offer of the room was still valid. I said yes and asked what had happened. Turns out they moved without transferring or finding new employment, and they hadn't found any jobs in the new city. They had been living in shelters. I did feel for them and wanted to help my friend back on to his feet. 

I cleared out my craft room, Connor and Kevin returned to our city and moved in. We agreed they would find jobs, and not pay rent, they really couldn't without jobs at the moment anyway. They would stay short term and get their own place as soon as they had employment, plus enough for the first month and deposit. They promised to handle all the household chores and making of meals. This was nice as I worked long hours. The first couple weeks I didn't ask about jobs or pushed much because I wanted them to relax, feel secure and settle. By week three I did begin to softly inquire how job hunting was going. They said it was great and mentioned interviews they had and we all celebrated. 

This went on for two months, they stayed at the apartment, played video games and told me they were applying places, or had interviews, or interviews we canceled. I know the job market was hard so I did my best to hang in there with them. 

While all this was happening Kevin rearranged my kitchen, I went in on the weekends and couldn't find anything for several minutes. They also smoked, not in the apartment but on the stairs of the apartment and balcony. I asked them to stop several times, it was against the lease agreement and we would be fined or cited. They always agreed but I still found buds on the stairs.

They also loudly fought, to the point that they would both storm away for hours leaving a heavy feeling behind in the apartment. These were not the typical roommate type fights from before, they were mean and spiteful fights that left me shaken with a pit in my gut.  

A particular fight resulted in a coffee cup being broken. I was at work and I am not sure how it happened completely. Kevin messaged me to say ""Sorry, the house ghost knocked your cup over, lol."" Then attached a picture of the mug. It wasn't just any mug, it was a mug I had used with my grandpa every time I visited him for coffee mornings and took it after he had passed. 

I cried at work then had a serious talk with Connor about how the fights had to stop and if he was okay, or was there something else happening between him and Kevin. Connor denied  any issues beyond the verbal fights and tried to assure me that they were working though that issue in their relationship. I was skeptical and still am. Things didn't change much, except that when they were about to blow up at each other they went to their car to fight it out there. 

I really was regretting my choice to offer the room, and also feeling badly for regretting it because I didn't want them living their car. Until one day I was confronted by the building management who rightfully told me the smoking issue and noise issues had to be resolved or they were going to ask everyone to leave. Faced with eviction, I had to tell the guys they needed to find another place.

They pushed back saying they had no where to go. I let them know that I was so sorry, I cried because I didn't want any of us to be in this situation but if they didn't building management would force it with eviction and we would all be in an even worse situation. Kevin called me all sorts of names, detailed how I was at fault and left the house to sit in the car. Connor and I worked out details of me holding their things till he could return for them, we hugged and both cried, then he also left. I think we both knew that it was a true ending of things. 

I was sad things ended the way they did,  but I would be lying if I said didn't feel a relief once they were gone. Connor picked up things on two different quick visits but still left quite a bit behind. I haven't heard from him at all in the last three months. I feel bad because I didn't have firmer boundaries in our friendship. I feel like I've lost this friendship with Connor, that we may not ever be able to repair it. It probably ended long before as we had both grown into different people ",1,1754160501.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I know I'm a loser.

I went to meet my ex. Idk what it is about me that is so forgiving. I don't get why I don't believe people when they show me who they are.

He asked me to meet, I suggested coffee, but he mentioned he'd be late (due to work) so I said dinner/a meal works.

He showed up, with no plan. I had asked him prior to him leaving where we were going, he said we'd figure it out when he reached. He informed me he hadn't brought his phone w his gpay on it, so i'd have to pay. We split payments, so I was atleast expecting that.

No problem, I was paying for things anyway because he often forgot to pay me back, including my birthday, when he said he would treat me after I'd already ordered food home, made me pay (I was short on cash that day) and then never paid for that day. I ended up paying for dinner twice that day I was close to 0 in my bank acc. (It has since gotten better.) Coincidentally, we went to the same place we went today, on my birthday, and I just remembered that I was upset about this before till I forgot)

I wanted to know how to dress, just in case he'd suggest we go for a drink somewhere nice. Even then I had expectations (because I'm an idiot for real). I changed my outfit thrice, till I realised I should wear something neutral because being overdressed because I expected more would be humiliating. 

I asked him not to come upstairs to my house because I had informed my parents we had broken up. (I didn't want them to know I am stupid, and hadn't learned my lesson.)


He showed up in basically house clothes, like we were on a scooty ride in the gullies near his house, on a normal day.

He threw the ball in my court saying ""pick a place"" when I went downstairs. I was visibly upset, but I figured I'd just get on with it. I started scrolling zomato dining options on the road for around 3 minutes as we stood in silence, till he said lets go to X place (we went there once before and both of us got upset stomachs from the food).

His reasoning was ""he didn't know my area well"" so he expected me to decide.

We mostly went in silence, I was at the back, and he commented how I was moving away from him (to the back of the scooty).

(I was not touching him, I didn't really want to)

Anyway he brought up how it felt like I had my guard up (I wasn't really looking at him directly, I was honestly too disappointed.) He is perceptive enough to read EVERY minute gesture of mine, but somehow wasn't able to see my disinterest in sex that day.

He spoke about his feelings, how he was hurt etc. He talked about how he had no idea what to expect, despite him being the one suggesting a meeting.

Again, the entire time he focused entirely on himself and his experience of it all.

He also conveniently forgot a large chunk of the event.

He said when I used the ""r word"" he was scared. He claimed he apologised and then proceeded to pull up messages on the 19th of July when the incident happened, to prove he was entirely apologetic. Except, he kept defending and the first ""apology"" was ""I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to stop"" and other variations of ""I didn't know you were disinterested."" ""Why didn't you tell me and so on"".

Proving himself wrong, he was shaken, then he said I accused him and I go at him with aggression, the whole time my initial phrasing was ""I don't want to have to request not to have sex in my own relationship"" and ""it's so disrespectful that I have to ask for basic decency"".

I remember trying to tiptoe around it because I knew my manchild ex would throw a full blown tantrum.


He noted that I was only meeting him for dinner to confirm if my decision to end the relationship was final or not in my mind. Idk how he got that from my demeanor, because this was exactly what my thought process was prior to seeing him. I wasn't sure if I was making the right choice leaving my love.

In case anyone had any questions regarding how perceptive this guy is, he's such an overthinker, he is literally a mindreader if he is around you enough, as he was with me.

And yet, he couldn't tell if I was ""uncomfortable enough to stop"".

He knew I was uncomfortable, just wasn't sure if he had decided I was uncomfortable enough for him to stop.

Anyway I proceeded to explain to him again and again how an apology like his ""I'm sorry this happened to you"" when ""this happened"" by him, doesn't count for shit.

I explained that when he ""caught"" my like on that cheating reel I instantly knew I fucked up, and I was instantly apologetic that I hurt him and I would do anything to make it better. I gave him my ig password and suggested he go through it because ig and reddit are literally the only things I use and I never reply to reddit messages because it's just tiring.

 All my interactions are on comments because thats all I can keep a track of.

Anyway, I know I fucked up with the cheating reel, but despite knowing he was straight up wrong about me cheating (I don't fw cheating at all), I accepted my error, I knew I was trying to hurt him at the time.

I straightaway said I knew it looked bad and I'd like to fix it because I didn't cheat and I'd have liked to prove it over time and re-earn his trust.

Honestly, what else would I do? I loved him and ofcourse his sadness made me sad.

But for him, he went into defense mode instantly, he didn't care to console me, or comfort me. It was like he was only looking out for himself, despite being the one to violate me.

Another notable moment of the dinner was when I mentioned I had told my friends about the incident to figure out if I was overreacting or not.

He put his face in his hands, and all he asked me over and over was ""who all did you tell?"" ""Now all your friends think I raped you?""

Yoooo bro when I tell you, I was shocked.

My mouth dropped. NOW HE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS IMAGE than just apologising to me.

See I totally get that the r word isn't a joke, it's a crime.

My whole point was, the way he was ignoring my boundaries, and sometimes straight up overriding them, made me feel like it was a rape waiting to happen.

He's the biggest brat man child I've ever seen. I can't believe I thought we could make it work.

Honestly it's all my dad's fault.

Growing up, my sister and I saw my father act like an overgrown toddler, and get away with being an immature brat; more so than us, literal children.

I think I internalized this, and I let my partners brat it out.

Honestly, I lost all respect for my ex, whatever little was remaining.

I'm more of a man than he will ever be.

My balls are big enough to accept when I am wrong and how I intend to go about fixing things.
I say things with my chest if I believe them, and I apologize with my whole heart when I am wrong.

I've wasted 8 months.

Never again. Never again.

Men always ask, ""where are all the good girls? Why can't we find them?"".

They've been burned so bad, they sit at home in silence and solitude working on themselves. They keep their heads down, and reserve their energy for themselves.

I wonder if men really deserve ""good girls"".

Diary, never again. If I decide to be in a relationship with a man again, I will slit my wrists and bleed myself out to death.

I then booked it from there, and he rode beside me while trying to speak to me like a creep. I asked my rapido to ignore him, (he has done this chengramo before and almost gotten my bike to crash into a dog, so honestly idgaf if he is injured)

Somehow he always injures himself when we are in an argument and he is wrong.

I was so embarassed I was out with him lol. I was hoping no one I knew saw me with him because my neighbourhood friends sometimes tease me. 

In other news, I am sleepy!!! It's 12:08am and I am a good girl so I will rest now.

Can't stop thinking about ex since.,"TLDR: Dated ex for 2 years, broke up 3 years ago. Saw ex's doppelganger. Had a talk, was reminded of old time. Can't stop thinking about ex, she haunts my dreams again. Would appreciate any kind of encouragement.  
  
A little background. We dated for 2 years & broke up 3 years ago. She was the girl I had my 1st crush on ever, we were in school. She left my city, we stayed in touch & only got together when we were adults, years later. We did not end on good terms, we broke up cuz we wanted different things in life. I had to do a lot to move on from her. I was in a good place, she did come to my mind occasionally but nothing more. It has been 2 years since I talked about her to anyone, want to maintain that so came here.

THE TRIP. Went on a trip abroad with the boys. One evening we go out shopping, one shop caught our attention as I was looking around. That is when i saw her across the street in another shop. I was shocked & confused whether that was really her, I snapped out of it & realized it was a doppelganger. I hid in this store so as to avoid looking at her.

After a while, I went up there she was having some fruits asked if I could have some, she was happy to offer. We were talking & the way she talked was so much like ex. I was reminded of the time when I was with her, how happy I was & how I felt we were the only two people in the world everytime we were together. I did tell the doppelganger, I came over to talk cuz she reminded me of an old friend. I asked when she closes the shop & if she was interested to have some coffee. Fortunately, she said no as she had to drop her friend & friend's daughter after closing the shop but she did give her number.

That was such an out of body experience, for those moments I was talking to her I became the old me. I always thought I was over her. I am, I know that I am never going back but just meeting her doppelganger has absolutely wrecked me, undone all those things I did to get over her. It has been a week since the trip, I didn't text the doppelganger, deleted her number as soon as I got back. My ex is haunting my dreams again, not sure whether they are dreams or memories. I feel the same loneliness I felt when the break up was fresh.

I know I'll get over it again, just wanted to put this out & get some words of encouragement in any manner be it your own getting over it story or words of wisdom. Thank you.",3,1754160351.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1mfy16q,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1mfy16q/another_i_passed_post/,"Another ""I passed"" post","So I sat the PMP exam at home yesterday morning and received email this evening that I passed AT/AT/T, overall AT.

I do not recommend anyone to study the way that I did.

I worked several years in manufacturing, oil & gas, heavy industries including as project manager for operational implementation in greenfield and brownfield sites. Our corporate methodology is aligned with PMP, though with different names for the artifacts, some differences in roles & responsibilities. I knew virtually nothing about Agile methodology, it's always been waterfall for me.

I studied AR at 1.25x speed. Faster than that and I struggle to process what he's saying. I tried to relate it to projects that I had worked on. I didn't take any notes. I was generally listening actively, trying to think about what he was saying.

I did use ChatGPT many times during AR course to give more context or examples, for example ""Create an example Lessons Learned in PMBOK based on a project to implement a new production line in a factory"", ""Create an example Communications Management Plan based on above project"". This helped me quite a lot.

I did all the questions on AR website and found them often difficult. 

I bought PMI StudyHall Plus. First I did all the mini exams (15 questions each) and got 73% average.

Then I did only one full length example and got 72% on that. I reviewed every failed answer and tried to understand the justification for the correct answer.

I watched once 18 PMP Mindset by MR on YouTube, that was very helpful to solidify my understanding.

And then I sat the exam. I had coffee and red bull, and used both toilet breaks. I had 40 minutes to spare when I finished. I had to swipe my webcam around to show my desk and area, proctor told me to get rid of the remote control for the air condition but besides that there were no comments.

Often I was down to 2 alternatives, some times 3, and I had no strong reason to favour 1. In those cases, I accepted that I don't know, don't waste time to dwell on it, choose the most likely answer and move on. If I really don't know, spending more time to think will not meaningfully improve the quality of the answer.

I do recommend to do all the 4 mock exams on PMI StudyHall, not just 1. But I ran out of time and had so much else going on at the same time.

I do recommend to use ChatGPT to create examples and material, at least it helped me in terms of making this a practical framework to use on real world projects.",8,1754160328.0,pmp,2,0.9,False

1mfxxgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mfxxgr/congratulations_letter_to_ex_girlfriend/,Congratulations Letter to Ex Girlfriend,"Hi everyone,

Me (25M) and my ex-girlfriend (25F) broke up on June 26, 2025. I’ve been thinking of writing her a letter to congratulate her on getting a room in a shared apartment.

A bit of context about our relationship: we were together for eight years. We started out as prom dates in high school, even though we hadn’t really spoken much before that. After prom, we hung out a few times, and two months later, we officially became a couple.

Our relationship was always pretty “chill.” She lived with her parents for most of it, while I bounced between living with my mom, who was struggling with a meth addiction, and staying with a friend’s family. Eventually, when my friend’s family bought a new house nearby, a few of us took over the lease of their old place. I’ve been living in the garage there for the past three years, paying about $600 a month in rent and utilities.

In April of last year, after we took a trip to the Philippines to visit her family, she was really excited about the idea of us living together. She moved into the garage with me. Despite the house being messy (our housemates weren’t the cleanest), we actually enjoyed living together and started to get a real feel for what sharing a life looked like.

Around that time, I landed my first big job in IT, making about $40 an hour. It was a huge step for me, I spent the past six years in college and never had a full-time job before. The pressure to prove myself and not mess it up was overwhelming. Over time, I started slipping mentally. I fell into procrastination, avoided responsibilities, and struggled to keep our space clean. I became emotionally distant and started to disassociate from everything, including our relationship.

In May of this year, I let her down by not planning our anniversary properly. We ended up just having dinner and exchanging a couple of gifts, but I could tell it wasn’t what she had hoped for. It was another sign that I was losing touch with the relationship and what mattered most. 

As the months went on and nothing seemed to be improving for me, my girlfriend started making big changes in her own life. She began working out regularly with the help of a virtual personal trainer, started cooking more for herself, and was clearly doing everything she could to build a better version of her life. Meanwhile, I was still stuck in my own struggles.

One day, things came to a head when I failed to help her with a meal she was preparing. She snapped a bit, and for the next few days, she spent long hours (four to five each day) on the phone with her friends. Most of the conversations were in Tagalog, and I figured they were catching up, especially since time zones made it hard for them to connect often.

Then came the day she broke up with me. She asked me to lie down on the bed with her and said she had a surprise. She hugged me tightly and handed me a letter. In it, she explained that she no longer wanted to continue our relationship because of my ongoing issues with chores and procrastination.

She spent the next few days at her parents' house. During that time, I reached out and asked if she’d be willing to meet and hear me out, not to try and win her back, but just to share what was on my mind. When she came back, we talked. I opened up about the things I’d been battling: my procrastination, my declining hygiene, and how I had let our relationship slip into second place.

That conversation felt like a turning point. I offered her the room for the rest of the month and told her I could stay with my grandparents if she needed space. She said she’d rather I stayed, especially since the other housemates were technically my friends. Over the next few days, things felt strangely comfortable. We talked, laughed at videos, and watched shows almost like old times.

On the Fourth of July, we hosted a BBQ with all our friends. Toward the end of the night, I could feel some distance from her. She seemed cold when I tried to talk with her, and it really hit me emotionally, how we could still share time together but no longer be *together.*

After everyone left and it was just the two of us in the room, I broke down in tears. She hugged me, and we sat together on the bed for four hours, talking more about everything. One of the big things she shared was how much she wanted a sense of independence. She had spent so much of her life making decisions with either me or her family in mind. Now, she wanted the chance to live on her own, to experience life as *her own person.*

I told her I was genuinely proud of her for making that choice and that I would support her in whatever way I could, however she needed.

After that day, we continued sharing the space for a little while. The following weekend, she came by with her dad to collect her furniture. I let them know I was more than happy to help (no hidden intentions, no expectations). I just didn’t want either of them getting hurt while moving heavy things. We loaded up the truck together, and I offered to go with them to the storage unit to help unpack everything.

On the drive over, we shared a meaningful moment, laughing and listening to a lot of the songs that had been special to us over the years. At one point, she told me she would miss the little things like that. I could feel the weight of that moment: both of us still cared deeply, but we also knew giving each other space was necessary for us to grow.

That day stuck with me. It was a turning point. I realized I needed to make real, lasting changes in my life, not just for her, but for myself.

Since then, I’ve started going to the gym, reading, journaling, cooking when I can, and I’ve committed to my sobriety. I’m now one month sober from marijuana and 21 days sober from alcohol. I’ve also started virtual therapy to help me unpack old trauma and begin working through the challenges that contributed to the breakdown of our relationship.

Two weeks went by, and I made sure to respect her space. I didn’t reach out through text or social media, and focused entirely on myself and my healing. Then one day, she messaged me to ask if she could pick up her aunt’s fridge that we had been using while living together. I told her it wouldn’t be a problem and that I’d be happy to clean it up and have it ready for her.

When she came by, we greeted each other with a hug, and the interaction started off on a positive note. Since I live next to a taco truck, we grabbed a seat and caught up. We talked about how we’d been doing the past couple of weeks, complimented each other’s new haircuts, chatted about going to the gym, and shared updates about apartment hunting.

She told me she had found a room in an all-women’s shared living space and would be moving in next week. I told her I was genuinely happy for her and that I hoped she enjoys this new chapter in her life.

I plan to send the card on the 30-day mark since she moved out, and I’ve included a few small, sentimental gifts inside:

* Polaroids of my chunky cat that she absolutely adores, so she can pin them up in her new room  
* Stickers of her favorite anime, *Violet Evergarden*, along with some cute bakery-themed washi tape  
* Two voice recordings of me singing: one is an OPM song that expresses care and warmth during this transition in her life, and the other is a lighthearted, goofy version of a K-pop song we used to listen to together  

I also added a note saying that if she ever wants to grab coffee, visit a farmers market, or just have a casual yap session. I’d be there, anytime, anyplace.

I’ve accepted that I may not get a response, and that’s okay. This isn’t about expecting something back, it’s simply a way for me to express care, mark this chapter with grace, and let her know I’m rooting for her from afar. Still, I’d love to hear some outside perspectives from the community on this gesture and whether it feels respectful, supportive, and appropriate.",1,1754160062.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1mfxx75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mfxx75/why_choose_the_nespresso_gran_lattissima_espresso/,Why Choose the Nespresso Gran Lattissima Espresso Machine EN640W?,"Testing out the Nespresso EN640W definitely turned my coffee-making routine into a daily ritual of indulgence. This espresso machine isn’t just a kitchen appliance—it’s like having a dependable barista on standby, but without the noisy crowd or overpriced lattes. The sleek design and stainless steel accents immediately caught my attention, giving off vibes of sophistication, and I must admit, it became the centerpiece of my countertop. If aesthetics matter to you as much as functionality, this stylish little machine won’t disappoint.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**

Using this espresso machine feels catered to my inner laziness, in the best way possible. With its patented One-Touch fresh milk technology, I can prepare anything from a creamy cappuccino to a smooth flat white just by tapping a button. The nine one-touch recipes—yes, nine!—include espresso, latte macchiato, and even straight-up hot milk for my nephew’s bedtime routine. My mornings have gone from chaotic to almost therapeutic because I simply pop in a capsule, press a button, and let the machine take care of the rest within about 25 seconds. It’s not just about convenience; the coffee quality rivals what you’d get in a high-end café thanks to the 19-bar pump system. am loving every cup.

[Check Nespresso EN640W price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0cmz874n2/)

**The Milk System That Wins Hearts**

Here’s what truly makes this espresso maker a stand-out—its fresh milk system. The detachable milk container is not just handy but also refrigerator-safe, which feels so practical for keeping the milk fresh for the next use. It froths up milk for cappuccinos and lattes perfectly, and if you’re someone like my sister who’s obsessively picky about the foam density, you’ll find this feature a game-changer. Plus, cleaning it is a breeze since the removable parts are dishwasher-safe. The automated descaling system even remembers my tough water hardness issues, saving me from unnecessary hassles.

**Positives**

- 19-bar high-performance pump ensures premium coffee flavor extraction.
- Nine one-touch beverage options for ultimate versatility.
- Detachable milk container can be refrigerated.
- Dishwasher-safe parts simplify maintenance.
- Sleek and modern design enhances kitchen aesthetics.

**Limitations**

- The energy-saving feature, while eco-friendly, might annoy coffee enthusiasts like me who occasionally forget to press the power button again after the nine-minute shut-off.
- The welcome pack with 14 Nespresso capsules is great for sampling but leaves you wanting more of your favorites almost immediately. Stock up, folks. 

**Build and Design**

When I refer to this machine as ""the espresso designer piece in my kitchen,"" I mean it. Between its matte and high-gloss finishes, not to mention the stainless steel details and the glass touch panel, it has become a topic of conversation for anyone visiting. While the dimensions (7.9 inches deep, 14.4 inches wide, 10.8 inches high) aren’t exactly compact, it doesn’t feel intrusive. The adjustable drip tray, designed to accommodate varying cup sizes, adds to the overall practicality, and for a fully automatic, feature-packed espresso machine, I find its moderate size justifiable. 

**Peer Products**

Having tried other single-serve brewers like the Keurig K-Café and the Breville Bambino Plus, let me just say, this Nespresso machine makes foaming milk a straightforward dream compared to its peers. While the Keurig K-Café is good value for money with its milk frother attachment, it doesn’t have the same sleek finish or quick heat-up time as this espresso maker. Similarly, although the Bambino Plus excels at pulling a quality espresso shot, it doesn’t offer the wide variety of beverage choices or the same compact functionality. Between these contenders, this model strikes an unmatched balance between sophistication, speed, and performance.

**True Value**

For what the Nespresso EN640W brings to the table, its price reflects the level of sophistication and functionality on offer. While it isn’t the cheapest, you are undeniably paying for convenience, aesthetic appeal, and expertly crafted coffee. The automated features like self-priming, descaling, and energy efficiency make it worth every penny. If you’re looking to splurge a little on coffee indulgence, this product delivers.

Yesterday I received the call. I'll have the pre hospitalization on the 21st and have surgery on August 26th(laparo, I'll keep the ovaries), a month early that what I expected, but my future surgeon had said that here in Italy no one wants to have surgery in August (because everyone is still enjoying the beach) so lucky me.

39F Childfree (And that's okay), diffuse and really painful adenomyosis, maybe endo too. I can't take the pill, and the hormonal IUD helped me a lot for a year, then stopped working.

 I'm obviously scared, not so much about the surgery because I can't do anything about it I'm not the surgeon, but about the post-op situation, whether it turns out to be the right choice, whether I'll feel worse (but then I remember how I felt during certain months during my period and ovulation when the anti-inflammatories didn't do anything, and I tell myself I can't always be this unlucky, right? right?).

I'm worried it might worsen my vulvodynia (which isn't in its most acute phase, but it's not the most sleepy either). And then, of course, the whole post-op management process. My partner and I have shitty families and I have great friends, but they'll all be on vacation for the first couple of weeks. And even though he's truly a special person (he has been for seventeen years), I hate to burden him with all this commitment and responsibility (He has also ADHD and hasn't had the easiest life in the world). We often like to joke that it's the two of us against the world, that we're this little family (with two terrible poodles), and while I like it 99% of the time, in this case it means extra effort on just one person. And he's the worst cook on planet earth. We seriously almost ended up in the hospital when he tried to make coffee with a moka years ago.

But I'm also excited. I have a really strong adrenaline rush, like when something important is about to happen. I'm curious about what happens next, thinking about that I could start a life without feeling sick ten days a month. I'm also excited and curious about the surgery because adult things always make me feel this way. I'm looking for recipes to fill the freezer as much as possible and allow us to survive my return from the hospital, I print out coloring books and choose audiobooks to bring (in case I'm too tired to read) and my favorite stuffed animal because you always need a friend at the hospital. A friend of mine drew my favorite character from Interview with the Vampire with my uterus. Let's just say I'm torn between fear and excitement.

- switched to another office immediately
- started completely avoiding me
- took her personal items from our shared desk
- acts visibly tense and cold when I’m around
-glares at me when passing me in the hall and makes snippy comments

I’ve stayed polite, normal, cheerful with everyone. But she barely speaks to anyone when I’m around

So now I’m confused. Was this some feminine control ritual i disrupted by being sincere?

From what I’ve heard she still flirts with the other guy at the office so it’s not that she’s anti flirting, she’s just anti me.

Like I’m not even mad. She approached me, flirted with me, I read it correctly and she acts like I disrespected her by taking it seriously?

Did I commit the crime of being emotionally direct in a post-flirt economy?",1,1754160011.0,redscarepod,11,0.57,False

I wasn't going to update because I got home with the baby and settled in and thought nothing of it, just communicated with my husband and my 14 year old through texts and phone calls while they were gone, but problems started to follow pretty soon after. 

After my husband returned to his parents' house without the baby and I, his mother huffed and started grumbling about how dramatic I am, how possessive I am of ""her baby"", how I was ruining this trip for everyone. SIL began winding her up, talking about how I didn't want anyone else to build a relationship with the baby. 

Husband told both of them to mind their business and get a grip, mentioning to MIL that he needed to have a serious talk with her once the kids left with BIL for lunch. MIL rolled her eyes and walked off. 

They have a talk and Husband insists to MIL and FIL that they can't expect me to roll over and let them stomp all over my limits just because they want access to our baby, that we are the final say in what happens with our children and if they can't get on board with that, they can forget about seeing them, especially not unsupervised. He told MIL that her sneaking around acting like my word meant nothing was childish and proved that she wasn't trustworthy, and he told both of them to keep their opinions about my weight to themselves. 

This starts what Husband told me later was a practically 2-3 hour argument that only stopped because BIL came back with the kids and husband refused to discuss this in front of them. MIL pulling out crocodile tears and asking why he won't defend her, insisting that I'm ""trying to ruin their relationship"" (Husband has never been close with his mother), and that she just wants to show off her baby to her friends and the extended family. 

Husband responds that if she really wanted to take pictures of the baby, all she had to do was ask for help so he or I could cover the baby's face, MIL and FIL argue that they shouldn't have to ask permission, they're grown adults and can do as they please in their own house. Husband reminds them that it is our baby, not theirs, and since they felt so strongly, that is why I removed myself from the situation, and if they wanted to see my baby, they could do it at our house, where they'll have to follow **our** rules. This went back and forth, with MIL eventually shouting and stomping her feet until BIL returned.  

For the rest of the day, MIL was grumbling under her breath and practically ignoring our older children, even as my 5 year old was clamoring for her attention. Husband paid her no mind, and spent the evening playing board games with the kids and BIL while SIL and his mother sulked in the kitchen. 

Fast forward to last night, husband was having a couple of beers with his brother while MIL and SIL have wine in the kitchen, FIL had gone to bed early and the kids were asleep. Husband hears MIL and SIL giggling to each other and while casually checking his phone, he sees that MIL has posted all of the photos she took of me on her facebook page, captioning them with ""\[My name\] won't let me see my grandson, so you'll have to excuse her hogging the frame"". 

In the comments of her post, she was chatting with her sisters about me: derogatory comments on my hair (as my icon and username reflects, I'm a natural redhead), shaming me for my ""selfishness"", and obviously comments on my body. Husband flips his shit, demanding that MIL take the photos down or he'd take her phone from her and do it himself, apparently there were **more** photos than even the ones we saw at first, and in several of them my top is fully open, nursing bra unclipped. MIL is unaware husband is serious and tries teasing him that she thought he wasn't ashamed of being married to a fat woman.  

Husband rushes into the kitchen and snatches MIL's phone out of her hands after a brief scuffle, deleting the photos from MIL's facebook and then taking them off of her phone altogether, before throwing her phone down on the counter and telling her that he was leaving first thing in the morning. MIL scowls and starts shouting that it isn't fair he's taking my side, he responds that he loves me, that it isn't my side vs hers, it's OUR side vs hers. 

I'm pretty out of the loop about all of this at this point. I've been cleaning the house, looking after the baby, and dealing with the cold I was apparently incubating for the first week of our visit, so I get a call from hubs while I'm doing laundry in the basement, he's in his car trying to keep himself calm but says that he'll be home early with the kids in the morning and that he wanted to have a discussion with me about our plans moving forward. He tells me what happened, I calm him down, and we both head to bed. 

Fast forward to this morning and I get up early with the baby to have breakfast and coffee waiting, Hubs arrives with 14, 10 and 5 at about 6AM, we have breakfast, and then the kids peel off to do their own thing. Our daughters leave for their friends' houses, and the 5 year old goes into the basement den to watch cartoons on the big TV. 

Hubs and I talk, and he says he's done with that annual visit to his parents' place, and that he's planning to have some one-on-one time with his brother a few times a year instead. We go over a plan of action in terms of much stricter boundaries, deciding that the kids won't be going to the in-laws' house anymore, and while the in-laws visit us at our house, if they act out, they'll be kicked out. 

MIL has been blowing up his phone since he left, but he's ignoring her for the time being and helping me with cleaning. He also sheepishly admitted that as disrespectful and frustrating as MIL's creepy photos were, they'd given him a new appreciation for my round face (I picked a winner, y'all, truly).

**TL;DR- MIL had a tantrum after I left and posted the photos she took- even more than I'd previously seen- onto Facebook until DH deleted them after taking her phone from her. Husband returned home with our kids and now we're back to business with new rules in place for MIL and FIL for the future.** ",449,1754159755.0,AmIOverreacting,75,0.99,False

# Best Coffee Arabica Peru Hard Beans? 2025 Review

Coffee arabica peru hard beans are highly sought after by coffee enthusiasts and professionals alike, known for their unique flavor profile, dense structure, and consistent roasting characteristics. These beans, grown at high altitudes in the Peruvian Andes, offer a distinctive cup that stands apart from othre origins. With the coffee market constantly evolving, it's crucial to stay informed about the best options available. This review will delve into the qualities, benefits, and drawbacks of Peruvian hard beans, aiming to provide a comprehensive guide for making an informed purchasing decision in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The arabica peru hard bean is characterized by several specific qualities that set it apart from other coffee varieties, contributing to its exceptional cup profile and overall value.**Bean Density:** The high-altitude growing conditions in Peru lead to a greater bean density.

The hard bean designation results from the dense cellular structure developed due to the climate. Beans that are grown higher in the mountains tend to mature slower, which produces a physically harder coffee bean.Higher density ofen results in a more even and consistent roast.This results in the ability to extract more of the desirable flavors during brewing. The bean’s internal structure can be carefully developed to ensure balanced acidity, sweetness, and body when roasted by an experienced roaster.

**altitude of Cultivation:** Coffee arabica peru hard beans are typically cultivated at elevations exceeding 1,200 meters (4,000 feet) above sea level.

Cultivating coffee at high altitude leads to cooler temperatures. This cooler habitat causes the coffee cherry development to slow down, which improves the overall bean production. This slow maturation process intensifies the bean's flavor compounds to deliver a more complex and nuanced flavor profile. High altitude also affects the bean’s acidity, often leading to brighter and more vibrant cups of coffee.

**Processing Method:** The most common processing method is washed, which highlights the bean's inherent flavors and cleanliness.

Washed processing includes the removal of the pulp and mucilage of the coffee cherry. This method contributes to a cleaner cup profile with a brighter acidity. This means the brewed flavor is less influenced by the processing itself. Frequently enough, fermentation tanks are used in their processing. After washing, the beans are dried, frequently enough on patios or raised beds. This drying process requires careful monitoring to ensure consistent moisture levels and to prevent mold or other defects.

**Screen Size and Grading:** Peruvian hard beans typically have a screen size of 15 and above, indicating a larger, more uniform bean size in grading.

Uniform bean sizes ensure even roasting. Coffee beans that are graded as ""excelso"" or ""premium"" frequently enough meet high physical standards,meaning that there will be a minimum amount of defects throughout any batch. Screen size is a key indicator of bean quality, and Peruvian hard beans often meet the highest grading criteria. Uniformity allows roasting professionals to dial in profiles to achieve optimal flavor.

## Core Benefits

arabica peru hard beans offer several distinct benefits that appeal to both home brewers and professional coffee roasters, making them a favored choice for those seeking consistent quality and unique taste.

Peruvian hard beans provide a complex and well-rounded cup that is pleasing to a wide range of palates. The flavor profile changes depending on the specific micro-region within Peru. However, most beans offer a balanced acidity, subtle sweetness, and pleasant mouthfeel. Roasters can develop the flavor to have intense notes ranging from citrusy to chocolatey, making it one of the most flexible bean origins. The versatility allows the bean to be a good single origin as well as a blend component.**Consistent Roasting Performance:** Due to their uniformed density and structure, the beans show excellent consistency during roasting, allowing for reliable reproduction of desired flavors.

Roasters appreciate the consistency in roast times and even development as over-roasting and under-roasting happens much less frequently and easier to control. This consistency minimizes the risk of batch variations which helps ensure the production of a high-quality product every time. This allows any professional roaster to maximize their yield and minimize waste. Consistency means cost savings and less time wasted.

**Versatility in Brewing Methods:** These beans perform well across various brewing methods,from espresso to drip coffee,consistently delivering a well-balanced and flavorful experience.

Their versatility makes them ideal for those who enjoy experimenting with different brewing methods. Whether prepared in a French press, pour-over, or espresso machine, the resulting cup retains the distinct qualities of Peruvian hard beans. This versatility means it can be used in multiple products and does not require dedicated equipment.

**How should hard beans be stored to maintain freshness?**

Served with:
UK armed forces
[REDACTED]
I.E.U (Infection Eradication Unit)


(Interview 1)

My name is James Cooper and I was a sergeant in the British armed forces. I had been in the army for just over four years when the infection started.

Z-day was… and I assume for most people, an absolute nightmare. Everyone lost something that day. We were about to go on leave that day, but we were told we had to assist the police service with riot control. It was out of nowhere, no warning, nothing on TV or on the radio. It all kicked off very quickly.

No one knew what happening at the time as we were barely briefed on the situation. We geared up and were sent out to a few local town centres. Riots were usually confined to one town or area but this was erupting everywhere and the police didn’t have the manpower to tackle the situation. We thought it was civilians doing the damage as we were told many police and other soldiers were being attacked and were being injured. As we were setting up roadblocks our radios went crazy with word of some of our boys being killed. We couldn’t understand why this riot was so violent or what caused it. Soon enough, it didn’t matter.

Like I said, we were setting up roadblocks. Proper barricades too. Barbed wire, sandbags, jersey barriers and even hedgehogs on some streets. It felt like there was a lot we weren’t being told. 

The crowds were huge. They were shoulder to shoulder along the streets. Barely any room to move through. This would prove disastrous.
The crowds didn’t look like they were rioting but more like they were trying to get away from something. The way these people were panicking, you would think there was a tsunami behind them. 

After all of us tried in vain to calm the situation, it got worse. In an instant, the rioters started screaming and running off in different directions. When they cleared, you could see what they were running from. It was… hectic. All I saw were people scrambling and leaping on each other. At first, I thought the rioters turned on each other but then I saw the blood. They were biting. Tearing at people’s throats and some poor bastards getting dragged into the crowd in multiple pieces.

Our radios went absolutely crazy. Everyone began panicking and just started shooting. I was in very basic kit. All I had was my issued L85 and a few magazines. I felt extremely under equipped for whatever was happening.

Eventually the crowd in front of me scattered and left an empty runway leading straight to me for the infected. A few of them took off at full sprint towards me with, foaming at the mouth and blood flying everywhere. The sounds of those things, man… this is what they were like at the beginning. Before they… you know… changed.

I raised my rifle and let off some rounds. Double tapping on centre mass. It was enough to drop most of them but with others they just got up again. Those ones needed headshots.
Leg shots didn’t work at all. I saw some running around with legs hanging on by a thread. Barely slowed them down. 

My mag was emptied a lot faster than I thought it would and I didn’t have time to reload. If you’ve ever used an L85, you know reloading that thing is more complicated than it needs to be. I had no choice but to climb up the front of the troop carrier behind me. When I got up top I took the time to reload my rifle while shaking like a shitting dog. It wasn’t more than fifteen seconds before a couple of infected started climbing the front of the truck. I stood up and put rounds in them but I realised I needed to run. It didn’t matter where I just had to run.

I jumped down from the rear of the truck, I hurt my ankle pretty bad but I just kept running. At the end of the street I saw another troop carrier but this one had some of our boys in it. I shouted and screamed at them to let me in as I sprinted up the street and jumped into the still moving truck. Some of the guys grabbed me and helped pull me in. We drove. We drove through every blockade and checkpoint we helped set up along with any people stupid enough to be in our way.

(Interviewer)
“Were the people that got run over infected?”

Some were. Others were just… in our way.

The rest was a blur. When the adrenaline wore off, we were back at camp. We were stationed at [REDACTED] for a while after.

One day we were called into the briefing room and told where we were being assigned. Some were being assigned to different jobs around the base. Others were being shipped out to different parts of the country.

Then there were people like me. Different units with odd names and designations. I was put under the command of Captain [REDACTED]. A new team was being put together and they needed people. I was only a corporal at the time and I thought I was just going to be zombie fodder. 

The unit was the Infection Eradication Unit (I.E.U). Our job was basically just zombie killing. Move into an area and wipe everything out. The Captain would map out an area and tell the unit the kill absolutely everything in that area.

(Interviewer)
“Define everything.”

Zombies. Animals. Thugs.

(Interviewer)
“Civilians?”

We tried to rescue as many civilians as we could but… most of the areas we were sent too, we were sent there because they were overrun. 

Being in the I.E.U made me feel like I was helping. Like I had a major part in ending the epidemic. Obviously it took nearly ten years for everything to get to where it is now. Honestly I feel like units like us are why we can walk around here again. Why we have food, electricity, petrol in our cars and can do interviews like this. It’s because of the men and women that picked up a rifle and decided to take back their country.

(Interviewer)
“Are you happy that most average citizens are armed now?”

Not happy but it’s necessary. Have you ever been to Alaska? In the northern parts of Alaska where you get a lot of polar bears, it’s pretty much mandatory to carry a gun for protection. I don’t see this as any different. The infection didn’t go away. It’s still out there and it WILL come back if we aren’t careful.

(Interviewer)
“So you stay armed?”

Of course I do. I have a Glock 19 on me at all times, mate.

It’s still the UK so obviously everything still has regulations and rules.
All citizens are advised to carry a firearm. Most gun laws completely changed after Z-day, like how they allowed people to have handguns agains and now if you have a gun it’s mandatory to open carry. A pistol on your hip in a holster or rifle on your shoulder. Nothing concealed or hidden because you can get fined for that now. We’re recovering from a zombie apocalypse and they’re still trying to fine people for stupid shit.

(Interviewer)
“ Well I don’t have a gun.”

Then you’re a fucking selfish idiot. What if a zombie attacks you? What if it infects you? Then you go on to infect others. You start the apocalypse all over again because you didn’t have a fucking weapon!

I need coffee.

(End of interview 1)


(Interviewer 2)

(Interviewer)
“Let’s talk more about your time with the I.E.U. What was that like?”

Like I said; I felt like we were helping. As time went on we got better at it. We had strategies and we started getting better equipment. The best thing we got were sets of new BDUs (Battle Dress Uniforms) that had like a thin chainmail inner lining. Bites became less of a threat pretty quickly. We didn’t need too much armour. We wore very basic ballistic gear, like riot gear I guess you would call it and later on when we worked close with [REDACTED] squad, we got to use nods.

(Interviewer)
“What are nods?”

Night vision goggles. I probably shouldn’t mention those guys here, can we cut that?

Yeah we were pretty non stop for a the first year or so. I was sent to an I.E.U squad up north in Scotland. We slowly made our way down through the small towns and villages. The major population areas were bombed. It wasn’t worth sending loads of guys into a city full of zombies when you could just firebomb the whole place. Safer too. At the time, we still weren’t sure how the virus worked. These high population areas were considered to be ‘contagious’.

I remember standing on the other side of the Tay bridge watching Dundee get completely levelled. I think they bombed that place just for fun sometimes. (laughs)

Taking Edinburgh was tough. Some parts were bombed while we went in on foot and had to clear out the zombies the hard way. Because they wanted to protect a lot of historical sites, they didn’t want to bomb everything. 

(Interviewer)
“Couldn’t survivors still be in those cities?”

We called those places ‘dead zones’ for a reason. Everything in them was dead. Well… you know what I mean. 

I get what you mean though. A lot of guys in the group wanted to save people. When we didn’t find anyone to save, morale got lower and lower. Some of the guys felt like we were failures. I knew what we were. We weren’t saving anyone. We were a clean up crew. It wasn’t uncommon to find some of the guys in a bad way. Crying, screaming, freaking out or some with their rifle in their mouths. It was the end of the world and we were very aware of it.

The absolute worst case I was a part of was when one of our squad mates found his family. They were in their house. Infected. The guy tried to let them out. He was frantic and trying to unlock the front door. When we tried to stop him, he pointed his rifle at us and told us to back away and that he’s going to save his family.

(Interviewer)
“And what did you do?”

We shot him.

He was ready to kill his own guys to try and save some people who were already dead. It wasn’t the only time something like that happened. One of guys sees a family member or someone they know and they just freeze. Some acted like the first guy. Trying to save them. Some just immediately blow their own brains out. It’s just… a lot… for some people. Realising the only reason they had for sticking around was now a walking nightmare. I miss some of those lads. 

Some of the hardest bastards I’ve ever known… Men that faced certain death every day and were able to still have a laugh with the lads… as soon as they see their wife or their kids or something. They just…

Well… there’s reasons why we get free psychiatric help.

(Interviewer)
“What about you? Did you have family?”

Yeah.

I grew up near London. By the time I got to London it had already been a few years. I never found them.

Can I get another coffee? I fancy a smoke too.

I.E.U (Infection Eradication Unit)


(Interview 1)

My name is James Cooper and I was a sergeant in the British armed forces. I had been in the army for just over four years when the infection started.

Z-day was… and I assume for most people, an absolute nightmare. Everyone lost something that day. We were about to go on leave that day, but we were told we had to assist the police service with riot control. It was out of nowhere, no warning, nothing on TV or on the radio. It all kicked off very quickly.

No one knew what happening at the time as we were barely briefed on the situation. We geared up and were sent out to a few local town centres. Riots were usually confined to one town or area but this was erupting everywhere and the police didn’t have the manpower to tackle the situation. We thought it was civilians doing the damage as we were told many police and other soldiers were being attacked and were being injured. As we were setting up roadblocks our radios went crazy with word of some of our boys being killed. We couldn’t understand why this riot was so violent or what caused it. Soon enough, it didn’t matter.

Like I said, we were setting up roadblocks. Proper barricades too. Barbed wire, sandbags, jersey barriers and even hedgehogs on some streets. It felt like there was a lot we weren’t being told. 

The crowds were huge. They were shoulder to shoulder along the streets. Barely any room to move through. This would prove disastrous.
The crowds didn’t look like they were rioting but more like they were trying to get away from something. The way these people were panicking, you would think there was a tsunami behind them. 

After all of us tried in vain to calm the situation, it got worse. In an instant, the rioters started screaming and running off in different directions. When they cleared, you could see what they were running from. It was… hectic. All I saw were people scrambling and leaping on each other. At first, I thought the rioters turned on each other but then I saw the blood. They were biting. Tearing at people’s throats and some poor bastards getting dragged into the crowd in multiple pieces.

Our radios went absolutely crazy. Everyone began panicking and just started shooting. I was in very basic kit. All I had was my issued L85 and a few magazines. I felt extremely under equipped for whatever was happening.

Eventually the crowd in front of me scattered and left an empty runway leading straight to me for the infected. A few of them took off at full sprint towards me with, foaming at the mouth and blood flying everywhere. The sounds of those things, man… this is what they were like at the beginning. Before they… you know… changed.

I raised my rifle and let off some rounds. Double tapping on centre mass. It was enough to drop most of them but with others they just got up again. Those ones needed headshots.
Leg shots didn’t work at all. I saw some running around with legs hanging on by a thread. Barely slowed them down. 

My mag was emptied a lot faster than I thought it would and I didn’t have time to reload. If you’ve ever used an L85, you know reloading that thing is more complicated than it needs to be. I had no choice but to climb up the front of the troop carrier behind me. When I got up top I took the time to reload my rifle while shaking like a shitting dog. It wasn’t more than fifteen seconds before a couple of infected started climbing the front of the truck. I stood up and put rounds in them but I realised I needed to run. It didn’t matter where I just had to run.

I jumped down from the rear of the truck, I hurt my ankle pretty bad but I just kept running. At the end of the street I saw another troop carrier but this one had some of our boys in it. I shouted and screamed at them to let me in as I sprinted up the street and jumped into the still moving truck. Some of the guys grabbed me and helped pull me in. We drove. We drove through every blockade and checkpoint we helped set up along with any people stupid enough to be in our way.

(Interviewer)
“Were the people that got run over infected?”

Some were. Others were just… in our way.

The rest was a blur. When the adrenaline wore off, we were back at camp. We were stationed at [REDACTED] for a while after.

One day we were called into the briefing room and told where we were being assigned. Some were being assigned to different jobs around the base. Others were being shipped out to different parts of the country.

Then there were people like me. Different units with odd names and designations. I was put under the command of Captain [REDACTED]. A new team was being put together and they needed people. I was only a corporal at the time and I thought I was just going to be zombie fodder. 

The unit was the Infection Eradication Unit (I.E.U). Our job was basically just zombie killing. Move into an area and wipe everything out. The Captain would map out an area and tell the unit the kill absolutely everything in that area.

(Interviewer)
“Define everything.”

Zombies. Animals. Thugs.

(Interviewer)
“Civilians?”

We tried to rescue as many civilians as we could but… most of the areas we were sent too, we were sent there because they were overrun. 

Being in the I.E.U made me feel like I was helping. Like I had a major part in ending the epidemic. Obviously it took nearly ten years for everything to get to where it is now. Honestly I feel like units like us are why we can walk around here again. Why we have food, electricity, petrol in our cars and can do interviews like this. It’s because of the men and women that picked up a rifle and decided to take back their country.

(Interviewer)
“Are you happy that most average citizens are armed now?”

Not happy but it’s necessary. Have you ever been to Alaska? In the northern parts of Alaska where you get a lot of polar bears, it’s pretty much mandatory to carry a gun for protection. I don’t see this as any different. The infection didn’t go away. It’s still out there and it WILL come back if we aren’t careful.

(Interviewer)
“So you stay armed?”

Of course I do. I have a Glock 19 on me at all times, mate.

It’s still the UK so obviously everything still has regulations and rules.
All citizens are advised to carry a firearm. Most gun laws completely changed after Z-day, like how they allowed people to have handguns agains and now if you have a gun it’s mandatory to open carry. A pistol on your hip in a holster or rifle on your shoulder. Nothing concealed or hidden because you can get fined for that now. We’re recovering from a zombie apocalypse and they’re still trying to fine people for stupid shit.

(Interviewer)
“ Well I don’t have a gun.”

Then you’re a fucking selfish idiot. What if a zombie attacks you? What if it infects you? Then you go on to infect others. You start the apocalypse all over again because you didn’t have a fucking weapon!

I need coffee.

(End of interview 1)


(Interviewer 2)

(Interviewer)
“Let’s talk more about your time with the I.E.U. What was that like?”

Like I said; I felt like we were helping. As time went on we got better at it. We had strategies and we started getting better equipment. The best thing we got were sets of new BDUs (Battle Dress Uniforms) that had like a thin chainmail inner lining. Bites became less of a threat pretty quickly. We didn’t need too much armour. We wore very basic ballistic gear, like riot gear I guess you would call it and later on when we worked close with [REDACTED] squad, we got to use nods.

(Interviewer)
“What are nods?”

Night vision goggles. I probably shouldn’t mention those guys here, can we cut that?

Yeah we were pretty non stop for a the first year or so. I was sent to an I.E.U squad up north in Scotland. We slowly made our way down through the small towns and villages. The major population areas were bombed. It wasn’t worth sending loads of guys into a city full of zombies when you could just firebomb the whole place. Safer too. At the time, we still weren’t sure how the virus worked. These high population areas were considered to be ‘contagious’.

I remember standing on the other side of the Tay bridge watching Dundee get completely levelled. I think they bombed that place just for fun sometimes. (laughs)

Taking Edinburgh was tough. Some parts were bombed while we went in on foot and had to clear out the zombies the hard way. Because they wanted to protect a lot of historical sites, they didn’t want to bomb everything. 

(Interviewer)
“Couldn’t survivors still be in those cities?”

We called those places ‘dead zones’ for a reason. Everything in them was dead. Well… you know what I mean.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Eagles vs. Bengals Preseason Showdown: A Tale of Two Titans (Who Both Need More Sleep)**

The 2025 NFL preseason kicks off with a barnburner: the defending Super Bowl LIX champions, the **Philadelphia Eagles**, hosting the **Cincinnati Bengals** in a clash of titans, tradition, and questionable third-quarter decision-making. Let’s parse the odds, dissect the news, and add a dash of absurdity to crown a winner.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tango

The lines here are tighter than a quarterback’s grip on a deflated football. For the moneyline, **FanDuel** and **Caesars** list both teams at **+1.91**, implying a 50-50 tossup. DraftKings, however, gives the Eagles a slight edge at **-1.8** for Philly and **+1.8** for Cincinnati, while MyBookie slants toward the Bengals at **+1.9**. The spreads? A chaotic mosaic: DraftKings has the Eagles at **-1.5** with 1.87 odds, while BetRivers lists them at **-1.0**. The totals hover around **35.5**, with most books offering even money on over/under.

Translation: This game is as close as a tie between two rivals who both forgot to pack a sense of direction. The Eagles’ slight edge in some spreads suggests bookmakers trust their **defensive line’s ability to nap through a Bengals offensive drive**, but the Bengals’ +1.5 lines hint at a “steal” opportunity for those who think the Eagles’ offense still runs on coffee and bravado.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Additions, and Existential Crises

The Eagles, fresh off their **Super Bowl LIX title**, are facing a schedule so brutal it could make a war veteran question their life choices. Per Ralph Vacchiano, they’ll battle seven playoff teams on the road, including their “home-and-home” with the Commanders (a rivalry so intense, it’s basically a civil war). Key players like **Jalen Hurts** and **A.J. Brown** are expected to see limited action in the preseason, which is code for “they’ll play until they trip over their own cleats.”

The Bengals, meanwhile, are a well-oiled machine with a secret weapon: **Joe Burrow’s ability to throw a spiral so tight, it could drill a hole in a glacier**. Cincinnati’s

* Where should I go shopping? What I'm looking for is below:
   * Indian clothes for fancy occasions - ex: lenghas, sarees, shararas/ghararas. Budget is no more than $300 per outfit.
   * High quality clothes I can wear daily in the US - would be cool to get outfits tailored with high quality fabrics if possible. Ex: linen pants, dresses, etc.
   * Cool jewelry - Indian and also contemporary that can be worn with my western clothes, ex: like Bhavya Ramesh but cheaper
      * Any gold stores with unique modern styles would also be interested to learn about.
* Where to eat/drink/check out - I enjoy good food, coffee, matcha, cocktails, wine, etc. I'll be with my family so not sure how much fine dining we can check out - I would say no more than $200 for a family of 4 for lunch/dinner - but cheaper is better for this.

A specialized LLM that decouples route selection from model assignment.,"Coding tasks span from understanding and debugging code to writing and patching it, each with their unique objectives. While some workflows demand a foundational model for great performance, other workflows like ""explain this function to me"" can easily be served by low-latency, cost-effective models that deliver a better user experience. In other words, I don't need to get coffee every time I prompt the coding agent.

This type of dynamic task understanding and model routing wasn't possible without incurring a heavy cost on first prompting a foundational model to determine the optimal model based on a developers preferences, which would incur \~2x the token cost and \~2x the latency (upper bound). So I designed an built a lightweight 1.5B autoregressive LLM that decouples route selection from model assignment.    
  
The core insight was to split the routing process into two distinct parts:

1. **Route Selection:** This is the *what*. The system defines a set of human-readable routing policies using a “Domain-Action Taxonomy.” Think of it as a clear API contract written in plain English. The router’s only job is to match the user’s query to the best-fit policy description.
2. **Model Assignment:** This is the *how*. A separate, simple mapping configuration connects each policy to a specific LLM. The ""code debugging"" policy might map to a powerful model like GPT-4o, while a simpler ""code understanding"" maps to a faster, cheaper model.

Full research paper and detailed links can be found in the comments section.

P.S The router model isn't specific to coding - you can use it to define route policies like ""image editing"", ""creative writing"", etc but its roots and training have seen a lot of coding data. Try it out, would love the feedback.",2,1754159282.0,AI_Agents,2,1.0,False

My job is doing the same thing: I don’t want to be there and even applied for ADA accommodations to come into the office less because it dysregulates me so much and they denied it and are forcing me to be in that environment. 

Also the servitude role: I was brought up taught to “serve” because that was my role as a lowly woman. I hate serving people. My job is in an assistance position where we “serve” the higher ups in our department. Do tedious clerical work whatever they ask me to do to aid them. Being required to drop everything if they give me a last minute task. I’m forced to set up/take down tables and food for events. My supervisor even lowered herself to fill up the department bosses coffee unasked like a fucking servant. I’m being forced into the same misogynistic serving role I was forced into in the cult. And any trouble and I’m always wrong for any small mistake I’m involved in, even if the higher ups were involved in it too. But others get away with mistakes. Double standards everywhere. My supervisor pointed out the difference in power between us and higher ups. We’re just glorified “help” and it’s disgusting.

This is ruining my life,"20F. It feels like I've tried everything and I'm scared to add certain things like probiotics to just add more confounding variables. And they might hurt me more than help. The healthcare system is a complete disaster and only want to prescribe medication -- but I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life. I want to figure out the root cause.

Here's a timeline of when I noticed things starting to get worse:

* February 2024
   * 23: Got a scrape on my elbow – didn’t think much of it
   * 26: Fainted in the bathroom in the morning, my elbow had red all around it and was hot to the touch. Went to the ER and they said if I had come any later, it could’ve been a case of sepsis. Got IVed with clindamycin. Was on clindamycin for the next two weeks without supplemental probiotics.
* May 2024
   * Started to get more into health and notice my symptoms more deeply. Realized I definitely was not having bowel movements as much as I used to, was straining on the toilet, and often having kernel/pellet sized poop
   * Fell into the routine of eating kiwis and drinking coffees to help
* July 2024
   * Lost my period
   * Somewhat disordered eating – was counting my calories and eating low fat, but still getting at least 1200 calories a day
* August 2024
   * Started tracking bowel movements on PCal
   * Went on a cruise, ate a variety of probably constipating foods, lots of just kernels
   * Visited first GI doctor who just prescribed Miralax
   * Blood tested negative for blood in stool and celiac disease
* September - November 2024
   * Started taking Miralax on and off, playing around with different doses
   * A month usually looked like this:
      * Two weeks of alternating days of no bowel movements or a few kernels here and there
      * A week of large sausages – as if the buildup from the past two weeks was just sitting in my colon and once my colon was full, then I would finally be able to go
      * The cycle continues
   * More stress during this time due to being in college
* December 2024
   * One week without any bowel movement for 6 days in a row
      * 2 regular bowel movements over a week and a half apart
   * 30: Viome test with some notable scores being:
      * Methane Gas Production Pathways (8/100) → this is actually what led me to want to get SIBO tested
      * Salt Stress Pathways (15/100)
      * Ammonia Production Pathways (21/100)
      * Uric Acid Production Pathways (26/100)
      * Biofilm, Chemotaxis, and Virulence Pathways (36/100)
      * Flagellar Assembly Pathways (36/100)
      * Bile Acid Metabolism Pathways (23/100)
      * Butyrate Production Pathways (31/100)
      * Putrescine Production Pathways (23/100)
* February 2025
   * Started progesterone pill as advised by my gynecologist → triggered my period
      * I also get period poops, so that helped a bit
      * Naturally got my period for the following two months following the induced one
* May 2025
   * Lost my period again
* June 2025
   * Moved to a new state where I don’t know anyone for an internship
   * Started educating myself more on constipation and knowing the consequences, which definitely triggered some health anxiety
   * 20: Got really anxious about not going for a while and tried liquid magnesium citrate (one bottle) at around 4pm
      * Triggered a bowel movement 16 hours later (which I think also signals some slow motility issues)
      * Didn’t cause a huge urge but I was going throughout the day
   * Started seeing a dietician to look into an elimination diet to see what are my trigger foods
      * Started low FODMAP for around 4 weeks → realized it did not have much of an effect on my bowel movements which makes me think it’s not a diet issue
      * Started logging what I was eating every day
* July 2025
   * 15: Took a SIBO breath test
      * Lactulose stimulated a bowel movement
      * Turns out I have methane SIBO (IMO) with a spike of 17ppm at 160 minutes in and 18ppm at 190 minutes in
      * I definitely have flatulence and burping but not some absurd amount like other people. I do get bloating and distension, but again, not to the extremes like I've seen with other SIBO patients on this subreddit.
      * The one thing that happens to me is twice this year, I got some extreme trapped gas. I'm not sure what triggered it or if it's random, but it's rare -- even when I eat high FODMAP foods. But this extreme trapped gas started with some cramping for two hours and then was significant, worse than anything I've experienced before, for 5 hours through the night. The first time it happened it was on-and-off attacks but the second was consistent pain. It felt like appendicitis. I was ready to call 911. Laying down hurt more than standing up but I felt dizzy, lightheaded, tired, and pale, so all I could do was sit.
* Things to Note
   * I now supplement with ginger (550-1100mg/day) and mag glycinate (100mg/day)
   * I get really anxious when I don’t go for a while because of what I’ve learned it could cause – more bacterial overgrowth, impaction, ER trips → affects my sleep
   * I’m leaning towards this being a motility issue exacerbated by methane SIBO and potentially other pathogens??
   * I’m waiting for the result from a stool culture and ova + parasite lab corp test...

Please help me with whatever advice you might have. I'm happy to answer any other questions in the comments in case I missed some important background info. I'm not sure where to go from here. Do I focus on fixing my gut dysbiosis first and introducing things like probiotics? Or do I do a killing phase for the IMO? Or do I wait on the results from the stool culture test to see if there are any other pathogens causing problems? Or do I buy a GI-Map test to get a more comprehensive overview? Or do I try to fix my hormonal imbalance first? I'm so confused.",8,1754158972.0,SIBO,13,0.9,False

# How the Smiths Brought a Frank Lloyd Wright House to Bloomfield Hills

# Melvyn Maxwell and Sara Stein Smith dreamed of living in a Frank Lloyd Wright house. Here’s how they made it happen on a modest teacher’s salary.

If you keep on believing, the dream you wish will come true. If that sounds like a line from a fairy tale, it is. It was also the philosophy that helped Melvyn Maxwell and Sara Stein Smith build their historic Frank Lloyd Wright house in Bloomfield Hills in 1949.

The dream began for Melvyn Maxwell (known as Smithy) in 1939, while teaching at a Detroit public school. Mesmerized by a slide presentation of Wright’s Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, he made a grandiose vow to his fiance, Sara — also a teacher with a modest salary — “One day we will own a home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.”

According to an excerpt from “Frank Lloyd Wright Remembered,” after a chance meeting with Wright at his home, Taliesin, the Smiths spent hours in the architect’s studio sharing their vision of building one of his homes in Michigan. They wanted it to become a mecca for artists and musicians — hosting small concerts and art exhibitions yearlong.

Wright was captivated by the couple’s arresting enthusiasm. Although he would design over 1,000 structures, including New York’s Guggenheim Museum, he amazingly agreed to design their home for just $9,000 — if they could find a site that would allow total integration of architecture and nature.

In the summer of 1946, the Smiths wired Wright that they found the ideal 3 acres near Cranbrook, off Lone Pine Road — perfect for enhancing Wright’s organic architecture. Wright answered back they would receive his plans “when the spirit moves me.”   

Fairy tales do come true.

Airmailed plans from Wright arrived in March 1947, and the real work of building the 1,800-square-foot house began. “The house, later named ‘My Haven’ by the Smiths, was to be a classic example of Wright’s Usonian design — made to suit the common American,” says Gregory Wittkopp, director of Cranbrook Center for Collections and Research.

Truly the house that love built, under Smithy’s direction contractors interested in Frank Lloyd Wright architecture worked au gratis or for reduced wages. “Famous landscape designer Thomas Church agreed to provide his plans, and local developer Alfred Taubman delivered glass for the entire home for just $500,” Wittkopp says.

The Smiths and their only son, Robert, moved into the completed masterpiece in the spring of 1950.

With its elongated, ship-like single-floor plan, the house showcases Wright’s deep Japanese aesthetic influence and his signature use of earthy elements. The interior radiates amber warmth from the tidewater red cypress wood walls to built-in shelving and cabinetry.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the majestic oaks and pond, bringing the outdoors in. The exposed brick and colored-concrete floors with radiant heating complement the wood and provide artful texture.

“Most importantly, Smithy and Sara’s vision became a reality, and visitors came and continue to visit from all over the world to appreciate the house,” says Anne Smith Towbes of Santa Barbara, California, previously married to the late Robert Smith. 

“They loved to share their collected artwork, including many sculptured ceramics, glass, wood, metal and textile pieces from Cranbrook students, and favorite artists like Marshall Fredericks and Paul Evans. Robert used to joke about the nose prints on the glass windows, as people curiously peeked in the house,” she adds. “And baths (Wright didn’t permit showers in his houses) were always interesting as there could be an impromptu tour group coming through — including the bathroom — at any time of the day.” 

According to Cranbrook research, Wright visited the finished home on three occasions: in 1951, 1953 and 1957. “He affectionately called the house ‘My Little Gem’ and gave them his coveted Frank Lloyd Wright seal of approval — his signed brick-hued tile that they revered and placed near the front entrance,” says Smithy’s niece, Dorie Shwedel of Bloomfield Hills. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

After the passing of the Smiths, their foundation was transferred to the Towbes Foundation, and much-needed restorations took place on the house in 2012. When Michael Towbes passed in 2017, the family donated the Smith House to Cranbrook that year.

“As beneficiaries of the historic residence, our intention is to preserve the integrity of the Smiths’ home and lifestyle,” says Kevin Adkisson, fellow for Cranbrook Center for Collections and Research. “I curated the home methodically choosing to keep only pieces up to 1984, when Mr. Smith died. We want to tell the Smith story down to the last detail — like the coffee tables that hold Cranbrook students’ art pieces, a Rodin (Museum) gift shop memento, Frank Lloyd Wright coffee table books and a plastic coffee set — that showed their relatable practicality.”

Wittkopp adds that with Cranbrook’s stewardship, the Smiths’ legacy of architectural and art appreciation lives on: “We’re honored to be able to continue educating the public and preserving this architecturally significant home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright,” Wittkopp says.

Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 

**Smith House Fun Facts:**

 

* The Smiths always kept a house guest book that showcased international visitors and renowned artists — something all visitors liked to view.
* Sara Smith’s favorite lunch was a grilled cheese sandwich, tomato soup and grapes, which she often served to her guests (including Gregory Wittkopp, director of Cranbrook Center for Collections and Research).
* Pristine landscape plans by Thomas Church (famous for the first kidney-shaped pool design) were recently found underneath the bed in the master room.
* Frank Lloyd Wright didn’t have the Smiths’ mailing address so he mailed his finished plans to the Affleck family in Bloomfield Hills — another house he designed — so they could pick them up.
* Wright once told Melvyn Maxwell Smith, “You would make a fine architect” — a comment Sara said her husband cherished all his life.

From Cranbrook's website: ""Smith House is unique among Frank Lloyd Wright-designed public sites for its extensive—and completely intact—collection of the home's original collection of furniture, artworks, decorative arts, and even household objects. The Center's new eMuseum portal provides access to the growing selection of Cultural Properties that comprise the Smith House Collection.""

I used to drink kefir for my digestion, it would really help with staying regular and just overall better digestion, but I started to get the opposite effects - after drinking kefir my digestion would totally shut down. Life full stop, it gave me a feeling like my whole digestive system was just paralysed. I assumed that it is an allergic reaction because I would also get this burning skin sensation that I usually get when I experience allergies, so I took Zyrtek and it helped with my symptoms that time. So I've stopped consuming Kefir since then and moved on with my life till around April.  I started to notice that I get weird reactions to Magnesium and it totally felt like allergic reactions (I took magnesium because it helped me stay regular, as I have quite a long colon, and my transit time is not as fast ). I've tried taking various forms of Magnesium and every one of them gave me these allergic reaction symptoms like flushing on my face, absolute insomnia, burning skin, dry skin, and eyes. I even joked with my family about this, like 'omg I'm allergic to magnesium'  because I did not assume this might be serious.. So I stopped taking magnesium. Then I started to notice that I get similar reaction to omega-3. Then to coffee. Then to probiotics. The reaction to probiotics was so bad. I did get the sensation that something is not right about an hour after taking them but the next day was the worst - the dizziness, the fatigue, this brain fog, the burning skin and it felt like my gut lining was also burning. I stopped taking everything and started to worry a lot.  
Fast forward to the beginning of May I started to get really serious episodes of shortness of breath and very bad feeling of fatigue. And those episodes would have no correlation to something I eat or anything, it would happen out of nowhere, but anything that would stimulate my gut not in direct way (like coffee, magnesium, omega-3, probiotics) would make it even worse. These episodes would last for couple of days and then get a bit better and then again worse. I was getting vertigo when I was outside. I used to be quite fit and be able to walk long distances easily, but I started to dread even going to a shop which is near my house because I would get a sensation that I might pass out.  The shortness of breath was so bad I went to ER 3 times. They checked my vitals and everything was good. My heart was fine, my pulse may have been a bit lower, but my oxygen levels were fine, they did a spirometry test without and with Albuterol both were equally good, and Albuterol did not improve anything. They did an X-ray of my chest, everything was good, my blood tests were good, except iron and ferritin a bit lower but not drastically. I was told that it was because of my low weight (mind you I was not underweight and looked healthy, I'm just naturally a petite woman). In one-month period, I gained 5kg. I stopped drinking coffee and taking all my supplements. At one point, it seemed that my breathing and overall being improved; I even started to drink a cup of coffee here and there and everything seemed fine. But as of right now, I am starting to experience shortness of breath and fatigue again , lack of energy, sensitivity to random foods, bloating, excessive gas, and sometimes indigestion. I am super scared of facing those extreme SoB episodes again, that I started to fear my life, I stopped working, going out, or socialising because I am scared to leave my house basically.   
No one in the hospital even said anything about Histamine intolerance or anything I just dig everything on my own and basically I am on my own right now in this. I had a history of troubles with my mental health, nothing major, just light depression, and when doctors see this in my health history, they just straight away say this is a panic attack and I know this is not one.   
I am getting tested for SIBO this month but I think there might be something to do with HI. If anyone has any insights on what might be wrong with me I would really appreciate any comments. As of right now, I am trying to eat a low-histamine diet and not consume any triggers that I've mentioned. I take B complex, iron supplements, vitamin D, and C. By the way, I've tried  H1 antihistamines and they did not help at all.   


Sorry for the very long post, but I would really like to be prepared to ask good questions and ask for test on Monday, so I am asking here for people who have experience in HI to see if there is any correlation. I even suspect MCAS. ",3,1754158935.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

1mfxgt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mfxgt3/could_the_cosori_pour_over_coffee_maker_deliver/,Could the COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker Deliver the Most Flavorful Brew Review?,"**My Experience with the COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker**

The COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker with Double Layer Stainless Steel Filter truly shines as an attractive and functional addition to any coffee enthusiast's arsenal. Featuring an 8-cup (34oz) capacity and a high-heat-resistant borosilicate glass carafe, this coffee maker has become a regular on my countertop. Its simple, no-fuss design is paired with thoughtful details, like the reusable dual-layer stainless steel filter and a solid wooden sleeve, making the brewing experience feel both efficient and artisanal.

**Positives**

- The dual stainless steel filter prevents coffee ground residue while enhancing flavor.
- Durable borosilicate glass carafe that can handle heat directly from a low flame.
- Elegant and sturdy wooden sleeve for improved insulation and grip.
- All materials are BPA-free, ensuring a healthier brewing process.

**Design and Build Quality**

I’ll be honest – I’m a sucker for good design, and this product doesn’t disappoint. With its minimalistic yet eye-catching combination of clear glass and a sleek wooden sleeve, the coffee maker feels both timeless and modern. The borosilicate glass looks delicate but proves its durability every morning when I heat it on the stove. I found the wooden sleeve not only beautiful but also functional with its excellent insulation and non-slip qualities. Unlike cork, which tends to get messy over time, the wood is easy to clean and retains its charm. 

**[Check COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker, price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0821dtmgt/)**

**Performance and Brewing Process**

Brewing a cup feels like stepping into a rich ritual. The dual stainless steel filter is a game-changer – it keeps the coffee clean of grounds but ensures that the essential coffee oils and flavors pass through. This creates a much richer, smoother brew compared to what you’d get with single-layer or paper filters. Adjusting the water flow, coffee grounds, and temperature allows for a personalized sip every time. For a coffee geek like me, having such control over the brewing process is paramount. It’s rewarding to experiment and discover slight variations in flavor.

**Convenience Factor**

Being dishwasher-safe for its glass decanter and filter adds to this product’s appeal. Cleaning up after a brew is effortless – no complaints here. That being said, the wooden sleeve requires a gentler hand. A cloth swipe or two is enough to keep it spotless, which I didn’t find cumbersome at all.

**Favorable Attributes**

- Completely manual brewing process allows for customization.
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup straightforward.

**Shortcomings**

Here’s where things get slightly less rosy. With precision at the heart of its appeal, beginners might find the learning curve steep. Getting the water temperature, coffee-to-water ratio, and grind size right takes some trial and error. While I personally enjoyed tweaking these variables, I could see how it might intimidate first-timers. Also, because the main decanter is glass, you’ll need to handle it with care.

- Steeper learning curve for newcomers to pour-over brewing.  
- Glass material, although durable, requires careful handling to avoid mishaps.

**Peer Products**

Comparing it with the Chemex and the Hario V60 (two popular players in the pour-over coffee space), one thing stood out – this coffee maker’s dual stainless steel filter. The Chemex relies on paper filters, which are good but don’t allow oils to contribute to the brew. The V60, though efficient, lacks the COSORI’s heat-resistant glass and durable build. Plus, the wooden sleeve on the COSORI is leagues better than cork alternatives, both functionally and visually. However, in terms of portability, lightweight coffee drippers like the Aeropress are unmatched and might be a better choice for hiking or camping.

**Bang for the Buck**

With all its features packaged into an affordable coffee maker, the value proposition is evident. The durability of its components and the reusable filter ensure long-term savings compared to constantly purchasing disposable filters. For a product that gives you complete control over the brewing process and delivers coffee-shop-quality results, I’d say it’s well worth the splurge.

So, my heart got broken everyday for the past 3 weeks. When I’ll meet you, I assure you that I’ll do my best to heal from this pain. So that I can give you the best version of myself when we’d be together soon.

I am so excited to meet you.

I know God taught me a very huge lesson of self respect and worth the past few weeks. I assure you that I will do my best to meet all of your love languages and I am hoping that you’d get to meet mine too.

I am in it for a peaceful and simple life, waking up early in the morning to make coffee and eat breakfast, walking our dogs everyday, spontaneous weekend dates, reading a book out together while holding hands in the beach, trying out camping and trekking, doing foodcrawls when we can, late night walks and long drives. I am so excited to share my life with you and I hope you would too.

At the same time, looking forward to ugly days too. Being in petty arguments and tough life making decisions. But knowing you are the loml, I know we both have the ability to treat each other with respect and basically just be able to weather the storm with love.

I’ll work on myself for now. Don’t rush yourself to come right away. I am not going anywhere. I’ll be here patiently waiting and love myself first while I wait for your arrival.

1mfxfg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mfxfg0/wedcuffed_novel_my_only_happy_place_was_with_my/,"Wedcuffed Novel:   My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker......","Life wasn't a fairytale. I learned that at five when Mom died, and again at twelve when Lisa, my step-mother moved in with her perfect daughter Chloe. At first, Lisa was kind to me, but soon she began showing her true, darker side. Chloe and I were the same age, but Lisa made sure that Chloe received all the attention from both her and my dad.

After a few months, I noticed how Dad started to ignore me as he got caught up in his ""perfect"" new family. Over time, I became just an extra, unwanted family member that no one cared about.

My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker. The three of us were inseparable until Adrian moved to a boarding school in London.

Jessica and I stayed close and kept in touch with Adrian every weekend. However, as soon as I started high school, Jessica began to ignore me, preferring to hang out with Chloe instead. Soon, they became best friends, and even Adrian stopped replying to my messages and calls.

As time passed, everyone around me seemed to compare me to Chloe or other girls. Lisa constantly insulted my looks and clothes and made sure others treated me the same way. Even my dad started to see me as a disgrace.

As little girls, we're often told stories of distressed damsels who need saving. But as I grew older, I realized I didn't need a Prince Charming to save me.

The only person capable of saving me was myself. I needed to become a strong, independent woman and stand up for myself.

I was clear about my future and goals by the time I finished high school. I worked hard to get into a top university, and my efforts paid off.

Five years later, Harvard's diploma gleamed on my wall. I'd traded starvation for strength, tears for titanium resolve. Even my reflection shocked me—waist-length hair, curves Ester swore made men trip, and eyes that no longer flinched.

Tomorrow, I'll be leaving Boston and returning to NYC after almost five years. During this time, neither my family nor Jessica or Adrian tried to contact me. My grandfather offered financial support, but I barely touched it.

As I packed my belongings and prepared for the airport, I tied my hair into a ponytail and examined my reflection in the mirror. My brown hair now cascaded down to my waist; I used to prefer short hair until high school. My round face was almost bare, with minimal makeup. My glasses were gone, and my hazel eyes, framed by thick lashes, were perfectly coated with mascara.

After taking one last look in the mirror, I grabbed my belongings and called a cab. Soon, I was on my way to the airport, hoping that everything would go well.

Little did I know, this journey back to NYC was going to turn my life upside down.

**Chapter 2**

It's been a week since I arrived in NYC. As soon as I landed in my birthplace, I got busy unpacking and setting up my home. This house was bought by my mother before she died. She wanted to keep it as a home, yet now, no family member is here with me today.

My family knew about my arrival, but no one had tried to meet me or contact me.

I brushed off those thoughts and continued sipping my coffee while sitting in the living room when I heard my phone ring.

I quickly stood up and grabbed the phone lying on the desk. A smile formed on my li-ps when I saw the name on the screen, and I answered the call.

""Hello, Grandpa! How are you? How is Grandma doing?""

""We're both fine, dear. How are you? Have you settled into your new home?"" he asked excitedly.

""Yes, Grandpa, I've settled in. I just wish you both were here with me,"" I replied, a bit sadly, making my grandpa chuckle.

""We'll be coming to visit you in a days, sweetheart. It's time I finally hand over the company to you,"" Grandpa said in a serious tone.

""Yes, Grandpa, I remember that. I just hope I can handle the responsibilities well.""

""You'll do great, my dear. You're perfect for leading the company,"" Grandpa assured me.

My grandpa, Stephen D'Amario never trusted my father—not after Mom died, and certainly not after he let Lisa and Chloe destroy what was left of our family. D’Amario Enterprises was Grandpa’s life’s work, meant for Mom, then for me. But after her cancer diagnosis, Dad took over, and Lisa made sure I’d never be fit to inherit it.

""You’re not university material,"" Dad sneered when I applied to colleges, parroting Lisa’s words. Yet I kept my grades up, clinging to one truth: the company would be mine at twenty-one.

The memories still clawed at me.

FLASHBACK

Jessica and Chloe barged into my room, their laughter sharp as knives. ""Ugly bit-ch,"" Jessica spat.

A book slammed into my face. Blood bloomed on my face. Then fists, nails, spit—each blow driving home my worthlessness. They destroyed my homework last, shredding it with glee.

""Know your place,"" Chloe hissed before slamming the door.

Alone, I sobbed, then rewrote the assignment until dawn. Weak. Pathetic.

FLASHBACK ENDS

I exhaled, flexing my hands—no longer trembling. At Harvard, I’d traded fear for fists. I even learned basic self-defence there.

Seeing how strong and decisive I am today gives me the confidence to take on the responsibility of being the heiress of D'Amario Enterprises.

Chapter 3

I've always gotten everything I wanted in life—from money to power, I had the finest of it all.

At 25, I'm one of the most successful businessmen in the country. Two years ago, my dad entrusted me with the full responsibility of the company, and today, it's one of the leading corporations in the USA. But the best part of my life is the love of my life, Jessica Martin. She's everything a man could ever ask for.

I've known Jessica since we were about 5 years old, but at 12, I moved to a boarding school in London. Despite the distance, Jessica and I always stayed in contact, and she supported me through every up and down.

During vacations, we always made sure to spend time together. I even remember Sarah, who used to be a good friend of ours. But after I moved to London, she started ignoring Jessica and even asked her to stay away from me. Jessica always told me how Sarah bullied her in high school.

As time went on, Jessica only grew more beautiful, both inside and out. Two years ago, after I took over the company, I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her, my life felt complete—she was not only pretty but also incredibly intelligent and talented. She was one of the top students in school and even got a scholarship to Harvard, but she chose to follow her pass-ion for modeling. Today, she's one of the highest-paid models in the industry.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on my office door. Without looking up, I told the person to come in.

I heard the click of heels on the floor and caught the familiar scent of perfume. Jessica walked towards me and sat on my desk.

""Good afternoon, love,"" I said, moving closer and taking her hands in mine.

""Hey, babe,"" she replied seductively, placing her other hand on my che-st.

""How was your day?"" I asked. She started telling me about her photoshoot that morning while I admired the beauty sitting before me. She looked amazing in that fitted white dress, her blond mid-length hair perfectly styled and falling onto her shoulders. As a model, she had a flawlessly toned body. She was perfect, and I was the luckiest man to have her in my life.

""Adrian, what are you wearing to your parents' wedding anniversary?""

""I want our outfits to coordinate since that's when you'll tell your parents about us,"" she said as she adjusted my tie.

""Well, you don't need to worry about that, love. My secretary has taken care of our outfits. You'll get the dress by tomorrow,"" I replied.

""Aww, thank you so much,"" she said happily. ""Now, if you're done with work, can we go home?""

""Sure, babe. Let me just call my secretary,"" I said, moving toward the phone to inform Josh of my departure.

I put on my coat, took Jessica's hand, and we interlocked our fingers as we walked toward the elevator.

I headed to my black Bugatti Veyron, opening the door for Jessica before jogging to the driver's seat. After starting the car, I soon stopped at a lavish Italian restaurant for dinner.

We chose a seat in the corner of the restaurant, and started discussing our future plans.

""Do you think your parents will accept our relationship?"" Jessica asked while sipping her wine.

""I don't think your mother is fond of me,"" she added as I narrowed my eyes.

""Why do you feel that way, Jess?""

""Ever since you came back from London, I've tried to talk to her, but she always ends up bringing up Sarah in the conversation.""

""She keeps telling me how sweet and kind Sarah is and how the three of us should hang out together like old times,"" Jessica said in a sad tone.

My jaw clenched at the mention of Sarah's name. What she did to Jessica was enough for me to hate her for the rest of my life.

""Sarah doesn't deserve to be our friend after what she did to you when I was gone. My mom doesn't know how ug-ly her true face is. Once she finds out, she'll stop talking about her,"" I replied angrily.

Even remembering how Sarah treated Jessica made my blood boil. Because of her, Jessica had to endure so many difficulties and traumas.

""Relax, babe. She's gone now. We don't have to worry about her,"" Jessica assured me, caressing my hand.

I smiled at her as the waiter brought our dinner. We ate while discussing the arrangements for my parents' anniversary party. Once we were done, I paid the bill, and we drove back to my penthouse.

I moved out of my parent's house two years ago and bought my place. After Jessica and I started dating, I asked her to move in with me. She's partially moved in, but she hasn't fully moved in yet.

As soon as we stepped into the penthouse, I slammed my li-ps against Jessica's. I grabbed her hair, causing her to tilt her head back, and I started kissing her neck hungrily, making her moan loudly.

Soon, we ended up on the couch. By this time, I had successfully removed her dress. She lay beneath me in her black lingerie, looking at me seductively as she started unbuttoning my shirt. Once she removed my shirt, followed by my pants, she took my member in her hand and began stroking it.

The room filled with our loud moans.

We ended up going for a second round and then showered together. Afterwards, we were so exhausted that we went straight to bed. I hugged her tightly in my arms, and soon, we both fell asleep.

Chapter 4

The past few days have been chaotic, as my parents' wedding anniversary is approaching. I've been busy with the arrangements for the party. It's also the day I plan to officially tell my parents about Jessica and my intention to marry her by the end of the year.

I even bought a ring for Jessica. If everything goes well, I'll propose to her at the party in front of everyone.

I looked up when I heard a knock on my office door and saw my father, James Parker, walking in with a serious expression.

""How are you, son? We hardly see you these days. Your mom misses you a lot,"" he said, sitting on the couch.

""I've just been caught up with work, Dad. I'll definitely visit Mom today,"" I replied while scanning some important files.

""I need to discuss something important with you. It's about the company."" I put my file down and turned to face him, waiting for him to continue.

""Since you've taken over the company, your mother and I think it's time for you to settle down. You'll be turning 26 this year, and we believe it's time for you to get married.""

Hearing this, I thought it was the perfect moment to tell him about Jessica, but before I could, he continued.

""We've decided you should marry the granddaughter of Stephen D'Amario. She's the heiress of the D'Amario family. Mr D'Amario was a close friend of your grandfather, so it would be a perfect match,"" my father revealed with a big smile.

I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine marrying anyone other than Jessica.

""No, Dad, I don't want to marry anyone else. I've already decided what I want in life, and marrying some heiress isn't part of it,"" I said angrily.

""In that case, the company will be transferred to Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter. Your grandfather and Mr. D'Amario signed an agreement that you and his granddaughter must marry, allowing the Parker and D'Amario companies to merge for mutual benefit,"" he said calmly.

""I'm still not marrying her. To he-ll with this danm agreement!"" I snapped angrily.

""Oh, son, you must marry her. If you refuse, 40% of Parker Enterprises will go to her. If she refuses, 40% of D'Amario Enterprises will come to us. If you both refuse, 50% of each company's shares will go to charity,"" he explained.

I heaved a big sigh, annoyed and worried about how to explain this to Jessica. Every plan I made for us seemed to be crumbling.

""I'll leave now; your mother is probably waiting for me,"" he said, walking out of my office.

As I pondered this new problem, my phone rang. It was Jessica. I answered, and her sweet voice came through the line.

""Hey, babe! Are you still at the office? Did you forget about our date night at my place?"" she asked.

I had completely forgotten about the date night due to my busy schedule, but I quickly covered my negligence.

""Of course, love. I can't wait to see you,"" I said, smirking at the thought of holding her in my arms tonight.

""Alright, see you at 7 then. Bye, love you,"" she said.

""Love you too, babe."" I hung up and went back to thinking about how to handle this marriage situation. How would Jessica react?

I immediately called my best friend, Noah. He's the COO of Parker Enterprises. We met in boarding school, and we've been best friends ever since.

I picked up the intercom and called my secretary. ""Could you please ask Mr. Andrews to come to my office immediately?""

Within 10 minutes, Noah walked in. ""Hey, everything good?"" he asked as he sat down across from me.

""My father wants me to marry Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter, or else the company goes to charity.""

""What?! No way. We've worked so hard for the company these past two years. It would all be wasted if it goes to charity,"" Noah exclaimed. ""What about Jessica? Did you tell her?""

""Not yet, bro. I'm planning to tell her tonight,"" I replied, massaging my temples.

""Isn't D'Amario Enterprises owned by Neil Darrell?"" Noah asked.

I immediately realized he was right. ""If Neil Darrell is running D'Amario Enterprises, then the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry is Chloe Darrell,"" I said, connecting the dots.

""Exactly. You can talk to Jessica about this. She can easily convince Chloe to refuse the proposal since they're best friends,"" Noah suggested.

""That's what I was thinking. I need to get to Jessica's place now."" I quickly left the office and headed to Jessica's apartment.

I arrived and rang the bell. Within seconds, she opened the door. A smile formed on my face as I saw her. She wrapped her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. I kissed her back passionately. Soon, we were undressed and made our way to the bedroom. After hours of being together, we finally went downstairs for dinner.

I or-dered sushi since Jessica can barely cook. To be honest, she's a terrible cook—she can hardly boil water—but she's perfect in every other way, and she's all I want.

We finished dinner, talking about our day when I suddenly remembered the conversation with my dad.

""Babe, I need to tell you something important,"" I said, holding her hands close to my che-st.

I explained the entire situation, from the marriage proposal to the merger, and the consequences if we backed out.

Before I could tell her about Chloe, she snapped at me angrily, ""So you want to leave me and marry some random brat now?""

""No, babe, the only person I want to marry is you. I can't even think of marrying someone else,"" I reassured her.

""And this marriage won't happen. All you need to do is convince Chloe to refuse the proposal.""

""Chloe? What does she have to do with this proposal?"" she asked.

""She's the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry, and since she's your best friend, you can easily convince her to refuse,"" I explained.

A smile formed on her li-ps, and she hugged me tightly.

""That can be done easily. She's dating Justin now, so I doubt she'd ever want to marry you,"" she said happily.

""And I'll never marry or love anyone but you,"" I told her, pressing my kiss to her forehead.

Chapter 5

I felt tense and doomed after hearing what Grandpa and Grandma told me. They arrived in the States last night, and today they've given me the biggest shock of my life.

According to them, I must marry for the merger or lose a 40% share of Amario Enterprises. Before they could finish their next sentence, I slammed my hands on my lap and stood up.

""I can't accept this proposal, Grandpa. I just graduated, and right now, I want to explore new things. I don't want to get married so soon.""

""Sweetheart, we're not forcing you, but we want someone strong to take care of you. Grandpa and I are getting old, dear; we won't always be here to support you. That's why we want you to be secure and happy,"" Grandma said, making me sit down again as she held my hands.

I thought about everything happening. When it comes to marriage, love, respect, and trust are the pillars of happiness.

I've always been nervous about relationships, scared of rejection and being unloved.

I feared I'd be the one trying to maintain the relationship while the other person didn't care.

""Sarah, we always want what's best for you. But remember, if you reject this proposal, the company will be ruined. This company was your mother's dream. Sophia worked hard to bring it to where it is today. But honey, we don't want to force you,"" Grandpa said, comforting me.

Thinking about my mother, I wondered what she would do in my place. Would she accept this to save the company? She worked tirelessly until her illness confined her to bed.

""Grandpa, I need to think this over. I'll let you know my decision soon,"" I said with a weak smile and left.

I went to my room and closed the door. I lay on my bed, replaying the conversation with Grandpa and Grandma.

I never thought I'd get married so soon, let alone just for the sake of the company. But deep down, I knew this company held my mother's memories, her hard work, and her dream of making Amario Enterprises one of the leading companies in the world.

I always thought that when I married, it would be for love, not a business arrangement.

I never had time to date in high school; I was always busy with studies and a part-time job. If any guy tried to ask me out, Chloe and Jessica made sure I never went.

I still remember the night after graduation when there was a party at our house.

FLASHBACK

I was in my room, checking my email about the applications I had submitted to various universities. I could hear the loud music coming from downstairs.

Chloe had invited everyone to the party. She even asked me to join, but I politely declined, knowing she and Jessica would likely have a plan to humiliate me again.

Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I closed my laptop and walked over. Opening it, I saw Justin standing there, holding two cans of beer.

""Hey, Sarah!"" he greeted me and walked into my room, sitting on my bed and looking around.

""Hey, Justin! What brings you here?"" I asked, walking towards him.

Justin was in the same grade as me and Chloe. He was one of the popular guys in high school. We weren't close friends, but we had worked on some projects and assignments together. He seemed like a genuine guy.

""Why are you sitting here alone? Why didn't you come downstairs and join us?"" he asked.

""Well, I don't like loud music, and I'm not used to these parties. Besides, I had some important work to do,"" I told him.

""Oh, that's alright. Everyone has their own tastes and choices,"" he said, offering me one of the beers he was holding. I politely declined.

""C'mon, relax a bit, Sarah. One beer won't harm you,"" he chuckled.

I hesitated but eventually accepted the beer and took a sip.

One beer won't harm me.

""So, what are your plans after high school?"" he asked, drinking his beer.

""Well, I'm planning to study architecture, but I haven't decided which university to choose.""

Before I could say more, I started feeling dizzy. I could hear Justin talking, but I couldn't understand what he was saying.

I could faintly hear Chloe and Jessica's voices inside the room. I heard them talking, but I couldn't make out the words.

Jessica's voice came closer as she whispered in my right ear.

""Let's have some fun, Sarah,"" she said, laughing wickedly.

I tried to get up, but Chloe pushed me back onto the bed. My T-shirt was yanked off aggressively, and my jeans were pulled down. I tried to shout for help, but no words came out. I could hear Chloe, Jessica, and Justin giggling.

I was lying there in just my underwear. Someone pulled me closer, and I heard Justin whisper something in my ear. All I could understand was that they were up to something terrible.

Justin gripped my waist, then started svcking on my neck.

""Please... don't,"" I begged them.

But they didn't stop. After a few minutes, I heard Jessica say it was enough; they'd gotten what they wanted.

I sighed in relief, but then I felt someone tugging at my hair. Before I could react, they started cutting it. I struggled with what little energy I had left, but a sharp kick to my ribs knocked me out.

FLASHBACK ENDS

When I regained consciousness, it was already the next day. I was still on the bed, my underwear tor-n. When I looked in the mirror, I saw bruises around my ribs and belly. My hair was nearly all gone—I was almost bald.

Jessica, Justin, and Chloe had made a video of me and Justin in bed. In the video, only my face was visible, while only Justin's back was shown.

They shared the video on every social media platform, and the whole school assumed I had shot it and shared it to gain popularity.

I even told Dad, but he blamed me for not being careful. Later, he chose to believe others, thinking I had purposely shared the video.

A tear slipped down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Because of that night, I couldn't trust any guy. Although I managed to overcome this fear when I moved to Boston, becoming more comfortable around new people, I still struggled.

I even went on a few dates, but things never progressed. I was still uncomfortable with intimacy and trusting anyone.

Thinking about the marriage proposal, I realized I still didn't know who I was supposed to marry. All I knew from Grandpa was that he was the young CEO of a rapidly growing construction company.

I spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about the marriage and the company merger.

By 4 a.m., after a night of deep contemplation, I was finally ready with my decision

1mfxfdu,https://i.redd.it/f5gigt85engf1.png,I build coding agent routing - decoupling route selection from model assignment,"Coding tasks span from understanding and debugging code to writing and patching it, each with their unique objectives. While some workflows demand a foundational model for great performance, other workflows like ""explain this function to me"" require low-latency, cost-effective models that deliver a better user experience. In other words, I don't need to get coffee every time I prompt the coding agent.

This type of dynamic task understanding and model routing wasn't possible without incurring a heavy cost on first prompting a foundational model, which would incur \~2x the token cost and \~2x the latency (upper bound). So I designed an built a lightweight 1.5B autoregressive model that decouples route selection from model assignment. This approach achieves latency as low as \~50ms and costs roughly 1/100th of engaging a large LLM for this routing task.

Full research paper can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655)  
If you want to try it out, you can simply have your coding agent proxy requests via [archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw)

The router model isn't specific to coding - you can use it to define route policies like ""image editing"", ""creative writing"", etc but its roots and training have seen a lot of coding data. Try it out, would love the feedback.

1mfxf00,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mfxf00/explore_best_over_the_range_microwave_ge/,Explore Best Over the Range Microwave GE JVM3160RFSS Review Worth It,"The GE JVM3160RFSS impressed me as an over-the-range microwave designed with functionality and everyday convenience in mind. Between its sleek stainless steel exterior and a range of user-friendly features, it quickly earned its spot as a reliable kitchen companion. Having put it through its paces over the past weeks, I’ve tried every setting—from reheating leftovers to experimenting with its defrost function—and I’m ready to share my insights, the good and the not-so-good.

**A Sleek Design with Roomy Capacity**

The stainless steel finish gives the GE JVM3160RFSS a polished, premium look that fits seamlessly into modern kitchens. Its dimensions provide a generous 1.6 cubic feet of cooking space, which handled everything from a large bowl of soup to a medium-sized casserole dish without issue. The over-the-range setup saved serious counter space and the design integrated well with my kitchen's layout. As someone who insists on functionality matching aesthetics, this was a win for me. However, the fingerprint-prone surface did require regular cleaning to maintain its aesthetic appeal, which may frustrate those aiming for a spotless look at all times.  

**User-Friendly Controls That Make Life Easier**

The electronic touch control panel was intuitive to navigate. I appreciated the convenience cooking controls for quick popcorn cravings or reheating last night’s pizza slices. The timed defrost was surprisingly reliable, defrosting chicken breasts evenly without partially cooking the edges like some older models tend to do. For those moments when you want to avoid noisy whirring, the turntable-on/off option was a thoughtful addition. This combination of simple yet effective controls made it enjoyable to use, day after day.

**Check GE JVM3160RFSS price on Amazon.**

**The Power to Get the Job Done**

This microwave’s 1000-watt power packed a punch, heating meals consistently and cutting down cooking times considerably compared to my retired model. Whether reheating coffee or cooking a quick dinner, I found the power levels adjustable enough to avoid any unfortunate “lava-hot” food moments. On the flip side, the two-speed, 300-CFM venting system was effective at reducing smoke and kitchen odors when I ran the stove below it, but it could’ve been a little quieter. The noisy ventilation also became noticeable during larger cooking sessions, which may not suit those looking for a whisper-quiet device.

**Positives**

- Sleek and space-efficient stainless steel design  
- Generous 1.6 cu. ft. interior capacity  
- Convenient cooking presets for quick meal prep  
- Reliable defrost function avoiding uneven results  
- 1000 watts of power ensuring quick and consistent cooking  

**Areas of Concern**

- Fingerprint-prone stainless steel surface requiring frequent cleaning  
- Venting system gets noisy, especially on higher settings  
- Limited flexibility for taller or oddly shaped dishes  

**How It Stands Against Product Competitors**

When comparing this microwave to popular options like the Whirlpool WMH31017HS or LG LMV1762ST, the GE JVM3160RFSS held its own in design and functionality. The Whirlpool model offered comparable cooking power and a sleek design, but its lack of a turntable-off function put the GE option ahead for versatility, at least for me. The LG microwave, on the other hand, edged ahead slightly with some of its sensor cooking options but came at a steeper price point, making the GE unit the better all-around value. That said, if ultra-quiet operation or advanced features like humidity sensors are high on your list, you might lean towards one of the competitors.

**Money's Worth**

For its price, the GE JVM3160RFSS provides a robust set of features, solid cooking power, and a polished design. It proved reliable for daily cooking tasks and didn’t break the bank compared to premium models with a handful of extras. While it doesn’t boast luxury features or silent operation, the overall package is smartly designed for regular home use. For someone on a budget looking to balance quality and affordability, this microwave slots in perfectly as a dependable choice.

Situation: Recently, our coffee machine broke and our boss won’t buy us a new one until he “sees more revenue on coffee”. We told him we can’t make money off coffee because we can’t serve coffee and he ghosted us. Naturally, we’re losing a lot of business. We do sell boba, tea, and ice cream but coffee was our main thing. There’s a lot of management issues overall that I’ve had to deal with. Since we’ve drastically lost business, I find myself shuffling papers for hours a day. It’s a tiny cafe so there’s only so much we can do. I work alone most of the time so I don’t do much. I love the place it’s so cute but poorly managed. The owners refuse to put money into the business since we hardly make anything. I’d be surprised if they made any money off of it at all. 

I really want to push through since there’s gonna be a change in ownership soon. They want me to keep working on Sundays (even if i get another job) since they have nobody else to work that day. It does get lonely when I have no customers and no coworkers and a big part of what I enjoy at work is talking to people. And making coffee. I find myself doing less and less of that every shift.
