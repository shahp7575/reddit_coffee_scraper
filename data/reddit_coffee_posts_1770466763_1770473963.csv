1qyexly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Southampton/comments/1qyexly/moving_from_london_job_in_eastleigh/,Moving from London - job in Eastleigh.,"Hi everyone. I just got a new job in Eastleigh and will be starting in the summer. I live in London right now and am looking forward to moving back to Hampshire, where I grew up. We're finding work for my partner at the moment and considering where would be a good place to live... Anyone got any advice on living in the area these days? I don't know Southampton itself too well but I am familiar with the county at large. We're looking for a pretty chill lifestyle but some nice nearby options for food, coffee and a nice pint wouldn't go amiss.

One option is to move into my mums place in Andover until we buy a house somewhere (not Andover). I'd have to commute daily to Eastleigh if we did this - anyone got any insight on how the commute would be? I do have a car.

Thanks for any insight or advice! We've got loads of time to check different places out, I'm quite excited.",1,1770473888.0,Southampton,0,1.0,False

Left to stare up at those flames that reached so high to touch the sky. Smoke that formed clouds darker then the night above. Shame it had been built in the middle of the newly paved street, and not upon what was left of that thing left mangled in the basement, Would of probably been for the better. If only it hadn't been part of the crime scene the boys in blue still needed to investigate.  Detective left pouring what was left of the oil tin into the bonfire built from the scrap of the deli furniture.

Softer trickle of water heard from melting snow that vanished into the hole of a gutter once hidden. Feline left staring down it, as black fur looked to slightly smoke from the heat even at a distance. Smoking like The Detective's clothes that had been left laying beside the fire, Having wrapped the only emergency blanket around the boy, And left standing in nothing more then his boxers. Blue tint of death now replaced with a devilish shade of red, Left smoking all the same from the thing left to hang loosely between his lips, Distant had been the look of one lost amongst his own thoughts as he joined the boy in his game of stare with the bonfire. Something about staring into these flames brought a sense of peace in this dire situation. Something that couldn't be said about the chaos that had been left behind in the kitchen behind them. 

Trio of officers having only stepped inside the place a moment prior, now that the path inside had been cleared by the fire. The Detective Hadn't bothered to waste his breath on what he had witnessed this eve, Letting the scene inside paint the picture. None knew just what they had been left to witness as they stare down from the edge of the kitchen. Both left to turn back, by the sudden sound the officer that had been looking behind the deli case. Having made the mistake of trying to lift Mr. Rabbit's head by the floppy ear, Only to be greeted with a familiar face that would roll between his feet. Light of the fire having been enough for one of the other officers to snap a picture. 

Light wasn't enough to get a clear view of what had been down in that cellar. One left holding the camera having been left trying to make out the unnatural shapes within the shadows. The longer he stared, the more irrational the fear had become of this thing he couldn't even see. Seemed no matter how hard they tried to get their flash lights to work, they had died the moment they stepped foot in this place. One of the other officers having returned holding a torch jury-rigged from a broken chair leg, Having come to shed a bit of light on this situation. No amount of pictures from other crime scenes could ever prepare them for what they were about to see. For words couldn't do justice for the image those tiny things scurrying from the tangled and twisted mass of what had been some unholy union between bone and ordinary house hold things. 

Minds left to race to try and untangle this mess of skeletons, yet something keep clawing at the back of ones mind that this had only been a single one, picked clean. As it had no known shape they could ever hope to recognize. Mind's couldn't even try to imagine what terror it might of been while it still had been alive. What little comfort that single thought would bring. Least this was what the mind of the one holding the torch had been telling him. Whatever the one beside him at had seen, had forced him to look away that fraction of a moment the thing had been illuminated. Color drained from his face, overcome with such overwhelming  fear that the contents of his stomach had been frozen in place, no matter how much he felt the urge to heave. Was only a matter of time before the one still staring over the edge of the abyss, To catch a glimpse of what had been floating upon it's surface. The only one to have been spared from this fate, had been the one still shaking from his encounter with the one wearing Mr. Rabbit's face like a head bag.

""Come on kid, You'll end up in a sticky mess if you do that"" Hand left to lower the kid's that had been trying to stick the rainbow lollipop into the fire. Couldn't help but think he'd been trying to roast it like a marsh mallow.   

""Just eat it like normal."" Normal wasn't the right word to use, Now that the boy had been trying to sink his teeth into the side of the thing as big as his head. Couldn't help but notice that even that stray had been watching this unusual display. 

""That's not how you're. . . "" Words left to trail off, This was probably about the most normal thing he had seen all evening. Having been trying to give his mind a chance to take a break from everything, Yet never able to stop thinking. 

Having been Wracking his brain over all the things he had known about the case the department all been tirelessly working. Having finally come face to face with what should of been another crazed and sadistic killer. 

*Nothing about The Hunter fit the profile they had created. Should of been dead the moment he stopped pulling the trigger. Should of probably been dead long before that, by the way this guy moved about and carried himself. Shouldn't be too hard to track down, Can't be many people who still own one of those old beak masks. Maybe stop by the church, See if anyone new has stopped by recently. Still can't explain how 15 shells couldn't so much as put a dent in that cloth even if it had only been loaded with birdshot. What kind of cloth sparks like a sheet of metal.*

Least The Detective had managed to get his mind off that thing that had taken delight in toying with him like one of those things scurry about in the cellar. 

*Still can't put my finger on just where I've seen that tooth ache waiting to happen the kid was just trying to sink his teeth into. Thousand reasons why the kid shouldn't have it in the first place, Just what is it about this kid that keeps attracting all these nut jobs to him, just to give him a piece of candy. The more I think about it, the more crazy it seems. As crazy as this gut feeling I'm getting that their isn't anything wrong with the candy that guy gave him. And why the hell am I starting to feel like I can trust a guy that put a gun to my head.* 

Having returned from digging around in the partially thawed wagon called paddy, The boy had been holding the  frozen bottle of what looked to have been his fizzy, bottled drink bubbles having frozen beneath the ice. Having set it down beside the fire, along with a frozen and undercooked slice of toast. Having been close enough the loose strands of wool of his blanket had burned up while what had been left of it started to smoke.

*Why is it no matter how hard I try to forget it, that face Hank and that other guy made the moment William's was mentioned. Like some one had flipped a switch. For all the faces that thing had been wearing, Least Hank was spared that grisly fate. Can't say the same for the one he'd come with, Or the others for that matter. Can only pray this will be the end of it, now that only scraps remain in what's left of the joint. Only a fool would have such wishful thinking.*

How lost in thought had he been not to even notice one of the officers standing beside him, warming their hands by the fire. Had only noticed him the moment he spoke up through the crackling roar of the fire. ""Think it's best we head back to the station, Now that the wind had started to pick up and the snows starting to fall.""

Detective left to flick what was left of his smoke into the fire, Looking to evaporate the moment it touched the flames. ""While I get dressed, You lot can decide who is going to stay behind to guard this mess until we can get a proper investigation started in the morning.""

*Funny how all the evidence served on a silver platter recently has managed to grow a pair of legs and walk away. Thinking back, Starting to wonder just how long this has been going on without even realizing it. Maybe it's best we all walk away for now, Can't take anymore chances. Let it get buried in snow and dig it up later. Wish I had a drink about now, Real damn shame I couldn't get a taste of that liquid gold the boy managed to dig up.*

Bottle of soda left near boiling by the fire being handed to him by the boy that had been shaking out the slice of burnt toast that had caught fire. That loud crunch that followed had been unsettling to those that had already been left jumping at their own shadows. Enough so that the officer he'd been speaking would now voice his concern of the situation.

""With all due respect Sir, The three of us have already decided we'll be leaving this place, Even if we have to fight tooth and nail with you about it."" The Detective wouldn't get a chance to answer just yet as another officer that had made their way to warm up by the fire. Continuing where the other left off. ""To be Frank, None of us are willing to stay behind with whatever that was or is in the cellar, Not when we got The Rookie's head sitting on the counter."" 

The last of them having been left shaking a moment beside the fire, one that had come from the fear of what they had finally managed to see what his mind have been trying to hard to deny. The same look of horror left frozen on The Rookie's face now stuck to their own. Torch they'd been holding tossed into the fire as they tried to muster what little courage they had left to speak on the situation they all found themselves in. ""Can't get that sound of my head, of all those rat's gnawing on those bones like a swarm of locust.""

""How they're making themselves inside those skulls when they aren't busy feasting on one another. . ."" Couldn't help but notice how rapid this officer's eyes had been to twitch, looking as if he had been caught in a waking nightmare. Words now lashing out in a sudden irrational fit of anger, as if trying to fight off the fear that had been trying to consume him. ""Just how in god's name can so many fit in one cellar, when I haven't seen any around town in the better part of a decade!""

Having calmed once more as he would finish. ""Let alone any other animals now that I think about it."" 

The first one speaking once more now that the other having been given the chance to finish. ""We still have six others unaccounted for just outside of town, None of us are willing to risk adding, or being added to that count."" 

All had been prepared for the worst as they awaited for The Detective's answer, As he wasn't one known to revoke his orders. Any time some one tried, It always left them in a worse situation. Reason they'd feel uneasy by how quick he had been to answer now that they'd all said their peace. 

""Alright, Let's go, I've had enough of this damn snow for a life time."" Hat taken from the kid that had been trying to place it atop his head the moment he leaned over to pick up the remaining shells from the Winchester. ""If the chief gives you any flack about this, Just tell him you were following my orders.""

It looked to them that The Detective had been just as eager as the rest of them to leave this place. Giving them a moment more to enjoy the warmth as only the cutting bite of the frigid cold awaited them. Having been looking over his Five shooter now that he gave the wheel a spin before locking it into place and holstered. ""Let's go kiddo,"" 

The one once holding a torch now left to lead the charge with the lantern that had been filled with what little fuel they managed to squeeze from the others now left behind. Left to double back and step into the tracks they had left in the snow. The Black Cat had been gazing from it's spot beside the fire as it watched the others quickly try to flee. To stare upon the boy that walked across the top of the snow so effortlessly and looked to be eye level with others that tried not to sink further. Left to continue it's game of stare with that hypnotic spiral the boy left lying in front of the entrance to it's home.

Had they been any slower they might of been lost in the sea of snow now that the blizzard had returned with a growing intensity that tried to freeze their eyelids shut upon their faces. None had been prepared, or the gear for this freak weather. Let alone the training for the extreme situation one should only ever need in an artic expedition. Having risked much to come to aid unknown individuals caught in gunfire. What shot of warmth they had when stepping through the station doors had been replaced by the sting that came with frosted windows.

Eyes wide of the one that had been in charge of fueling the boiler, having been pulled away the moment he had been heading down to keep things running. Greeted by the sound of chattering teeth of those that had decided they rather spend the night locked up behind bars. Left to nearly tumble down the stairs now that the smooth floor had become slick as the ice that now formed within their coffee mugs.

Another left to nearly slide their way towards a storage closet to pull free what few emergency blankets, and whatever else could be found for those left shivering. Lantern in hand forced down atop their desk in passing. The first light anyone had seen since the power had gone out at some point during their departure.  

Last of these men in blue had been making their way towards the metal canister left atop a heating vent. What had once been near boiling coffee now left frozen over. Looking around for anything that one could drink, having been trying to get the vending machine to pour a hot cup, only to find it had been no better. Having sworn the boy had just passed him by with a fresh cup a moment prior. One left steaming, and the boy slurping. A mug now offered to the one that had been sitting silently, and smiling from the cane he'd propped himself upon. A single gesture that now sparked a fire in the others. 

""Hey you! Ya I'm talking to you! Hurry up and bring me a cup!"" Another having taken notice just where the first had been looking. ""Why's that guy get the first cup, I'm freezing over here."" 

Nothing like freezing to clear one's head from a drunken stupor, As they rather spend their time trying to start a riot. Wasn't long till the others would join in on the yelling. None listening to what the officer had said, even when trying to show them the ice that had frozen over the top of that murky substance. The one that had started it, now pointing a in the boy's direction. To point at the one that should have been sitting silently beside him. One that had no longer been present, as all those yelling now sat silently in his place. Leaving everyone that had been paying attention, to second guess just what they had witnessed moments prior. All the while the boy had been left to leave unnoticed, staring down at the old coin left spinning in his fedora he'd use to catch the thing.

""Keep it down will ya, The heat will be back on in the moment. You've already been given three blankets."" Detective having placed his Fedora atop the coat rack a few feet from his desk. Jack having done the same to the one placed beside the room that had more or less become a second home.

Something uncanny with how mirrored both of their movements had been, To one of those that chose to spend the night behind bars. The Detective left wearing suspenders while the boy had been wearing the straps of overalls that covered the wool of his pajamas. Both placed their trench coats to hang upon the hook beneath each fedora. Was at this point their movements had one more begin to deviate. Boy left trying to pull his shoe free from the gumboot he'd been wearing. One that violently squeaked with the slightest touch of the rubber. One left to question just how the boy had managed to walk about as quiet as a mouse while wearing such things.

Snap of a lighter flipped open now that The Detective had been left staring once more upon the case board that had taken up much of the wall at this point. Having been forced to rethink the whole situation, while others had been attending to the bare minimum to keep this place running. Candles left placed upon each desk, while another had done their best to  thaw out cans of emergency rations that had been placed atop an exhausted vent. The last left sweating now that he returned from the boiler room to swap out with one of the others.  Needing to cool off a bit as he nearly collapsed from heat exhaustion.  

Seemed those left wrapped within blanks had little to do beyond watching. Curious had been the gazes of those that started to show interest in what the boy had been doing. Having been going about the place collecting all manor of things, All while none of the officers had been the wiser. Making them start to question why their had been a child left to roam freely in this place. Starting to question their own sanity now that the other they had been so sure to be present had just up and vanished, Of this child that looked to be hard at working upon his very own case.

*No matter how much I re-arrange all of this, It still just doesn't make any sense. What do we have if you take the hunter out of the equation. People end up dead under unexplainable circumstances. Still trying to figure out  just who they were, and left with guess work under these very same circumstances. Is this really the work of the same guy? Who even came up with the idea it was. I'll have to ask around and see if anyone knows. For that matter, who are all these witnesses I never had a chance to question. Keep claiming some crazed lunatic is always watching these scenes from a distance. And how is it every one of them failed to mention that beak upon his face. Now where did I put that photo. . .* 

Having taken a moment to look through the pile he'd pulled from the case board and left stacked upon his desk. To find a small crayon drawing with only a crude drawing of a smiling sun. Seemed he would need to find the kid to get to the bottom of this mystery. Least it wasn't too hard this time around, now that he'd glued himself to his own attempt at a case board left upon the wall of what had become the kid's own personal interrogation room with how often he seemed to pass through. Least now the kid was starting to give answers, in his own way. 

Upon a new spot upon the wall, the picture of Williams had been left taped in place. Eyes left blacked out in ink, that looked to run in that brief moment it took to dry. In a circle around this picture had been the profile pictures of five others. Each having been the photos taken on the day an officer was hired. The same style of picture Williams had taken. Something about this didn't add up, Seeing how both Hank and The Rookie hadn't been placed in this circle. Three faces he didn't recognize, one having been Hank's partner. Two others those that had gone searching for Williams the moment before his and kid's arrival. Took a moment for The Detective to the realization why he felt this uncanny sense of familiarity. Before his eyes would flash an image of that thing's face, that had been wearing these five others in the same arrangement. About to question why Williams had been present, when that grim realization had hit him once more like a sack of bricks. A cold sweat felt running down his cheek now that he glanced over at the boy. One that had been far too busy working on another case to take notice of The Detective's looming presence.

Jack having finished using a red crayon to trace the connection between each of those faces, before moving on to try and stick the picture of Red to the wall with adhesive. Watching it fall from the spot he tried to place, only to be left adding more, to try again. Nearly gluing the picture to his own hand in the process. Left to rapidly flap his arm to shake it free. Only to have The Detective pull it free, to hold it against the spot above the image of the truck pressed against the boy's old window. Taking a seat now that he turned his attention toward  all the open files left stacked upon the table. Finding Hank's left buried near the bottom. Having nearly overlooked something he had some how forgotten. Seemed Hank had retired some year's back. Exact same date those other three unfamiliar faces had done the same. 

*Four officers up and retire all at the same time in this small precinct that couldn't be home to more then a dozen. Even for a town this size, that's twice what you'd need for the ones with tougher streets then these. Don't even know where the kid managed to unearth these. This whole situation is starting to stink worse then all those bodies left to thaw in that tree. Starting to think we've all been lead on a wild goose chase. Starting to think I've been used as a distraction for what's been really happening behind the scenes. Can't believe it took the kid to pull away the wool everyone placed over my eyes. Starting to wonder just who I can even trust in the light of this little revelation.* 

Hand felt of the boy that patted him on the back. Seen digging about the front pocket of his overalls a moment, before pulling free a fresh doughnut that had lost all it's frosting. Frosting left smeared along the inside the boy's pocket. Having been covered in the mixture of flavors found during the boy's kitchen adventure. Might of mistaken it for a powdered one, Had it not been for the broken bits of pasta one would use in spaghetti. Pretty sure he got a taste of lint the moment he took a bite upon the thing. ""Think we should work on that sense of taste of yours kid, along with a few other things."" 

Words seeming to be ignored by this boy that had been left munching upon his powered and burnt slice of toast. A boy left slurping from a steaming cup of coffee. A coin flip on if some one had managed to get the vending machine working, Or if it had been that sludge left to sit weeks on end at the bottom of that pot. A question that plagued his mind now that the boy had offered him his mug full of piping hot coffee.

1qyew1o,https://i.redd.it/phv0nxjiz2ig1.jpeg,Neon Vision Editor - A lightweight and modern text editor Mac OS App built for speed and simplicity.,"Hey everyone,

I’m a Data Scientist working in enterprise IT (mostly Python/Cloud infra). Like many of you, I spend half my life in VS Code or JetBrains IDEs. They are powerful, but they are also heavy.

Sometimes I just need to quickly tweak a Python script, check a JSON config, or review a README without launching a browser instance wrapped in a desktop app or waiting for an indexing process to finish. I wanted something that felt like a native citizen of macOS—fast, lightweight, and respectful of my battery life—but still had modern syntax highlighting.

So, I created Neon Vision Editor with Swift UI.

It’s an alpha release, written purely in Swift and AppKit. No Electron, no cross-platform abstraction layers, no telemetry. Just a text editor that opens instantly and lets you work.What it is:

Native & Fast: Built for macOS 26 (Tahoe) using Apple Silicon.

Zero Bloat: No project management, no plugins, no background indexing.

Readable: High-contrast syntax highlighting for swift, python, javascript, typescript, java, kotlin, go, ruby, rust, sql, html, css, c, cpp, objective-c, json, xml, yaml, toml, ini, markdown, bash, zsh, powershell, plain

Syntax highlighting is being automatically applied to an opened file or pasted content.

Privacy-First: It doesn’t phone home.

Includes AI features for the use of Apple foundation model (and others) for syntax suggestions and some simple code completion (currently not functional yet).

Why I built it:

In my day job handling it infrastructure and migrations, complexity is the enemy. I wanted a tool that does one thing well: edits text. I don’t need my text editor to play music or brew coffee; I just need it to open a 10MB log file without choking.

Current Status:

It’s currently in alpha. It’s stable enough for daily use (I use it for all my quick edits), but it is a work in progress.

Where to get it: You can grab the build from GitHub Releases:

https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor

I’d love to hear what you think. I’m specifically looking for feedback on load times with large files and how the syntax highlighting feels to other developers.

Built by a human. AI tools used selectively for ideation and assets.

Cheers,

this is my first time writing a story hope you enjoy 

I am detective Lloyd of the London police department it’s been 12 years since the prime minister son has disappeared and I’ve been dedicating my whole life to finding him since I owe a debt to the prime minister. 

We have been hard at work locating tracking everything you need but its weird people ramble a lot around me say take your medicine oh you poor thing but I’m a hard cold detective.

Anyway we have been looking for clues near Buckingham Palace where he was last seen my partner scott says we should continue the search tomorrow it’s going to storm very soon. 



But I was determined i found nothing absolutely nothing how could this be why haven’t I found him is this some sort of cruel joke that I can never solve this case I went back to the office and slammed by hands on the desk.



Useless I mutter to myself I’m useless that’s all I’m good for then Scott came into the room and said something weird he said it’s time for your daily tests what is he playing at. 



It’s you Scott isn’t it scott looks confused you kidnapped the prime minister son now you’ll pay I hate you scott I really do now get out of the way I shout then just start rambling nonsense just nonsense I say.



Scott how did you even pass the police academy you’re dumb you’re dumb I’m the one who will solve this murder and repay my debt i look Scott dead in the eyes with just frustration and say 

…..Caretaker POV…..



I‘m George the caretaker for the prime minister he’s gone insane muttering about his detective life it’s been hard on him ever since his son disappeared I hope one day he recovers. 



It’s sad to see such a bright political figure be driven into insanity he would have done great for Britain I remind him to take his daily tests to evaluate his mental state he just keeps going on about his detective persona 



……Prime minister POV……



Look Scott I don’t need any of these tests i need to find the prime minister son just go away as I looked at my papers the picture of the prime minister son I say it looks familiar anyway.



Why does it look familiar I think to myself why do I feel like I can’t accept something no no I will find the prime minister son no matter what it takes I take a sip of my coffee and walk to my car. 

…….Caretaker POV……

The prime minister took his tests but is still droning on and on I wish I could do something to help but what i mean we’ve done all we can.



Is it because he can’t accept the truth that his son was found dead in the river I really wanted to help as much as I can but the prime minister feels impossible to read nowadays.



He‘s just a detective in his mind we hope one day on a fine morning he finally accepts the truth but as for my thoughts I don’t think he ever will as I put the picture of his son next to him to see how he reacts",1,1770473752.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1qyeusr,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1qyeusr/coffee_improved_my_outcome_and_i_almost_achive/,Coffee improved my outcome and I (almost) achive full remission,"So, I'm dealing with a Paranoid Schizophrenia since 2022 at the age of 26, symtoms started in 2016 with a depression then psychosis came in 2019, first with delusions then with hallucination (auditory) after few months. I didn't know of my Paranoid Schizophrenia (who's acually ""Residual Schizophrenia"" but the doctors don't have the guts to put this diagnosis)since doctors fight over my diagnosis (5 of 8 doctors told me that it couldn't be Schizophrenia because I was functional) so in 2022 I stopped to take my meds then the delusions came and I was involuntary hospitalized into the Psych Ward. The psycha(sad) cause ""trist"" means sad in my Third World Country Romania mother language put me on Invega Sustena aka Xeplion. I was on a high dosage of 150mg and now I kept taper (with my psychatrist guidance) to half of the dosage (75mg), the current dosage that I am now. I was low functional from 2022 to last week since I accidentally drank 2 coffees after trying everything (NAC, Caripiprazine, Glycine, Vitamins etc) and apparently my so-called ""Negative Symtoms"" are generated by the sedation of antipsychotic (at least that's my guess). Now I'm more stable than I never was : I'm not longer stare at the walls from 9 to 12 waitting for the night to ""escape"" from this life, neglect my hygiene and play some games on my PC. I also have backpain that stick around but I'm taking painkillers (carefull with that because it hurts your stomack on long term). Don't get me wrong : I'm not ""cured"" from Schizophrenia because I do not have any Positive Symtoms because I still struggle of getting a job but at least I can no longer rely on my parents on daily basis and I have poor concentration & poor memory. If you try ""my way"" with coffee as adjuvant therapy, make sure you have at least one benzodiazepine on your side (at the time of writting this text, I'm a little bit anxious with racing thoughts after dranking 3 coffees this day).

The Day I Lost a Friend to a Misunderstanding

1996. I was young, stupid, and surrounded by the wrong crowd. A boy—let's call him Ali—joined our class. He was a refugee and barely spoke German. The only words he kept repeating were: ""My city, everything's destroyed. Please help.""



Instead of helping him, my friends and I made fun of him. One day, he approached me. He wanted to see something ""worth seeing,"" something that makes life worth living. He was looking for hope.



My friends and I saw only one way to get him on a trip: We told him we'd take him to such a place. In reality, we dragged him across the border into the Netherlands. We made him pay for us all day in coffee shops, laughed at him, and got high. That evening, Ali got angry. ""What's the point?"" he asked. Completely dazed, I just laughed: ""That's it, Ali. Life is all about coffee shops and weed."" My friends took off when Ali's money ran out. But something stirred inside me—a spark of pity, or maybe just the belated awakening of my conscience. I stayed with him. We ended up in a cheap dive in an unfamiliar city. Ali was devastated. He begged me to show him something really nice.



I was drunk, my head was pounding. At the hotel reception, I grabbed a brochure as I walked by. I saw a picture: a huge crowd of people, all with their hands in the air, faces full of ecstasy. I only glanced at the headline: ""TO ALL CITIZENS.""



In my drunken stupor, my brain read: ""BURGERS FOR EVERYONE.""



""Tomorrow, Ali,"" I slurred. ""Tomorrow there are free burgers for everyone. That's where we're going. It'll be great.""



The next morning, I still wasn't sober. We got a ride to get close to the action. The driver dropped us off a few streets away – it was too crowded, too packed. We started walking. The crowd was enormous. I looked at the people and just thought: Wow, they look exactly like the ones in the brochure. Same clothes, same look.



I wanted to get Ali the promised burger so I could finally go back to bed. I pushed my way to the front. Suddenly, the atmosphere changed. Shouting. Running. I thought: They're really serious about the free food. Then stones started flying. Bottles. Panic broke out. I saw Ali, standing completely lost in a corner. I yelled into the crowd: ""I don't even want your damn burger! I'm only here for my boyfriend!"" At that moment, men ran towards us. They pulled out weapons. Shots rang out. We ran for our lives, back to the hotel. I collapsed on the floor of the room and fell into a deep sleep.



When I woke up the next morning, Ali was gone. His room was empty.



I turned on the television. On the news, I saw yesterday's images. There were no burgers. There was no festival. The headline on the flyer wasn't ""Burgers for Everyone,"" but a call to action: ""To All Citizens – Uprising Against the Election.""



What I had thought was a food line was a political demonstration that ended in bloody chaos. Ali, the boy who just wanted to see something ""worth living for,"" had been caught in the middle of a political assassination. The media called him a ""kamikaze gunman"" in the presidential election.



I never saw Ali again. Since 1996, I've wondered every day if my stupid, drunken misreading ruined his life.",1,1770473335.0,storys,0,1.0,False

I feel trapped in my own house.,"I’m 23F and preparing for UPSC and other government exams. Studying is literally my full-time focus right now because my biggest fear is ending up financially dependent or forced into marriage without a career. I’m working really hard to avoid that future.

But my mom constantly calls me useless and scolds me for everything. I need permission for basic things going out, talking to friends, even small daily choices. Because of this, I only have 2 close friends left. And even if I talk to them for 40 minutes, she starts lecturing me about being jobless and aimless.

Recently I had to go to my friend’s bachelorette party. She created huge drama saying I only want to roam around when the last time I even stepped out socially was 2 months ago.

Today was the worst. We literally watched a 3-hour movie together after lunch. After it ended, I said I’d make coffee for her. Suddenly she started lecturing me about wasting time, muttering and scolding. I asked, “Then what about the 3 hours of movie we just watched?”

She threw utensils on the floor. Actually threw them. Then said things like she wishes she died with my grandma and that she does everything for me and now I’m disrespecting her. Then she went out of the house (terrace ig. its been 3hrs she hasnt returned)

Every second in this house feels like mental torture. Clearing these exams will take at least 1–2 years and I honestly don’t know how to survive in this environment that long.

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just needed to vent. If anyone has been in a similar situation while preparing for big exams, how did you cope?

**TLDR**

23F preparing for competitive exams, mom constantly controls, insults, and emotionally pressures me. Today escalated to throwing utensils during an argument.

1qyeomm,https://i.redd.it/kkm56vdxx2ig1.jpeg,Quickmill Pop-Up,"Hiya. Just got a new Pop-Up a few weeks ago and I’m experiencing some challenges with grinding consistency. Even though I’m using the same fresh beans that produce a nice crema on my Sage Barista, I’m having difficulty achieving the same results with the Quick Mill Pop-Up. Not only crema, just flavour in general.

As I adjust the grind settings on my AF54 grinder—ranging from 10 to 17—I notice a sudden shift in extraction quality. For example, moving from one setting to the next can quickly flip from bitterness to sourness, without a smooth transition. Even at slower extractions, the coffee often feels watery, and the puck remains quite wet.

I’m using 18 grams of coffee (although I have tried to use 19/20g also), a puck screen, a wdt tool and a good tamper.. and a water temperature of 93 degrees. Despite these efforts, I’m struggling to find that balanced extraction. 

I did also notice the pressure goes up to 10 rather than 9.. could that be it? I have tried to lower it with the profiling lever which helps a bit but I still get a super soggy puck and the coffee just tastes mildly better.

Any suggestions? Attached is my puck after the profiling change to bring it to 9. Seems like channeling?",1,1770473239.0,quickmill,0,1.0,False

KZ AJ4
Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants
Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low
Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater
Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770473188.0,LoongBuyClub,2,1.0,False

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

It was an afternoon on a day off in June.

I didn't have any particular plans to meet anyone, so I strolled over to the cafe in the Beechwood Shopping Center.

Since transferring classes, I've been struggling to cope with the change in environment and have started to miss the time I spent living alone.

Also, it's still early, and the coffee shop is relatively empty.

I sat down at the small two-person table at the very back.

For the next while, I did nothing but drink coffee and kill about 30 minutes.

The coffee shop gradually became more crowded.

In the blink of an eye, four first-grade boys sat down at the next table.

I hadn't planned to pay them any special attention, but they seemed to be chatting enthusiastically before they even sat down, with laughter and chatter coming one after another.

""This school is really top-notch. I was so excited during the entrance ceremony!""

High-level? Were they having a heated discussion about academic qualifications?

""You mean Horikita, the student council president? The moment I saw her, I thought, 'How can there be such a cute student council president?!' 'No, there really is!' Then, looking around, I realized that I was surrounded by cute girls.""

""Yes, yes,"" the four nodded to each other as if to express their agreement.

It seems to have nothing to do with academic ability; it's just about the level of physical appearance.

Well, this kind of topic is probably what students—especially boys—talk about.

I picked up the cup of coffee, which was about half full. Although it had cooled down, it still had a wonderful aroma.

The restaurant is about half full now. But considering it's almost noon, and out of courtesy to customers, I'll stay for about 30 more minutes and then leave.

Then, I looked at my phone alone, but the first-year student who was just talking suddenly fell silent, which made me a little concerned, so I continued to observe.

Then they huddled together and whispered to each other, seemingly talking quietly about something, but the atmosphere was indeed very lively.

The four of them looked in the same direction.

The point where their eyes met was Ichinose, who was passing by the coffee shop.

""It's Ichinose-senpai... She's so cute!""

A boy's whisper could be heard from anywhere.

""She's my absolute favorite... I really want to date her...""

""Impossible! How could you possibly have won her over?""

""Why not? She smiled at me so sweetly when I greeted her!""

""She's like that with everyone. So cute and gentle, I'm totally smitten.""

It seems that Ichinose's popularity has remained unchanged from the past to the present.

Although it seems that she has significantly reduced her public appearances at school since resigning from her student council job, she is still far ahead in terms of popularity.

Faced with the excited two, the third boy raised his hand with some hesitation.

""Um, actually I... I also like Ichinose-senpai. I feel like she's beyond human levels...""

""Right, right!""

Because I was sitting next to them, I could hear their conversation very clearly.

Although they were speaking softly as if they didn't want others to hear, their voices grew louder and louder when talking about such happy topics.

""Like, an angel, isn't it?""

""An angel, that's it. Angel-level!""

The word ""angel"" was used.

Indeed, this is probably the first impression one gets from Ichinose, who has garnered the most attention during the school year.

No matter who it is, we not only think about helping them, but also actually lend a helping hand.

There was no ulterior motive; it was simply a pure desire to save people.

It can be said that the adjective ""angel"" accurately describes not only the appearance but also the inner self.

Of course, in a school system where one consistently does only good deeds and engages in competition between classes, it's hard to say that this won't become a shackle for oneself.

In any case, even the first-year students who have just entered the university seem to have the same impression of Ichinose as I did when I first entered the university.

""How should I put it? Unlike first-year students, she exudes a mature charm...""

Although they are only two years apart in age, in the small world of students, two years is indeed a big difference.

Three of the four people were having a lively and continuous discussion about Ichinose.

But what caught my attention was the boy with glasses.

So far, although I've nodded and made a few casual responses to several topics, I've remained quite quiet.

Even when the other three were discussing Ichinose enthusiastically, he didn't change at all.

""The strongest third-year student must be Ichinose-senpai, right?""

""Agreed!""

""Agreed!""

The first-year students even casually assigned her a name.

But at that moment, the boy with glasses made his move.

According to OAA, I remember it was Maruo, a student in Class 1-C.

Maruo's decision to neither deny nor strongly affirm the situation has caused quite a stir.

""...I think it's a bit different. Sure, Ichinose-senpai is cute, but to say she's the strongest, I don't really feel that way.""

It seems to be expressing opposition.

""Different? How are they different?""

In response to the objections raised by the friends, one of the boys crossed his arms and asked a question in return.

""My tastes are different from yours. No, I'd say you're all blind.""

As if he had been waiting for this moment to arrive, he spoke these words in a low voice, slowly raising his slender right hand and pointing his index finger into the distance with a hint of hesitation and unease.

The other three boys looked in the direction he was pointing.

I also became interested, and after a short while, I turned my gaze to it.

Then--

""She is the best woman I have ever met in this school... no, in all my life so far.""

It seems he's convinced that this girl absolutely deserves to be called ""the best.""

The woman Maruo mentioned was, to everyone's surprise, Hiyori.

She gave Kaneda a gentle smile as he walked beside her, as if she were saying something to him. On the other side, Kaneda also seemed to be genuinely enjoying his conversation with Hiyori, a fact I could clearly understand even from this distance.

""Who is she? No, she's incredibly cute... What a dark horse!""

""She's Shiina Hiyori-senpai. Like Ichinose-senpai, she's a third-year student and loves reading. If this were a game world, going to the library every day would probably earn her some real, superficial favorability, right?""

""Although I don't know what you meant by your example, at least you conveyed what you like...""

""But isn't that her boyfriend walking next to her? He seems to like reading.""

For first-year students who are unaware of her relationship with Kaneda, the presence of a boy who appears to be close to her inevitably raises suspicions about their connection.

In response to such comments, Maruo slammed his hand on the table with a loud thud.

""Haha, you can't say such stupid things. Shiina-senpai is pure and innocent, practically an ultimate perfect angel. How could she possibly drift along with the trivialities of worldly love?""

Love makes people blind, allowing no room for questioning.

""That's just your wish, isn't it...""

After this boy made a small complaint, another boy continued.

""Maruo, I admit Shiina-senpai is cute, but isn't it often said that those kinds of girls are surprisingly a bit mischievous? You think they're angels, but they're actually like devils.""

People can only see outward appearances; they cannot see into one's heart.

Even for someone like Ichinose who puts her whole heart into showing herself to the outside world, there is no concrete evidence to prove that her personality or thoughts are completely consistent with what she thinks inside.

On the other hand, this questioning would be even stronger for students who didn't even know her name before.

I initially believed she was an innocent soul, but that's not the case. If that's true, Maruo might be deeply hurt.

""...A demon...?""

Maruo muttered softly and quietly closed his eyes.

Then he nodded, and then repeated the up-and-down head-shaking motion several times.

""Shiina-senpai's devilish pose... hehehe""

Not only was she not angry, but somehow, she even smiled after being told that she might be a demon.

""Hey, hey, Maruo?""

The three looked at each other, and at the same time, they all had a feeling that ""this is bad"".

""No, I think this is a pretty good critique. It's true that Shiina-senpai is an angel, no, an archangel! But the idea that she's actually a demon is a blind spot. Wait, could it be that she betrayed the readers, which is why she might have this emotional outburst? Not bad, really not bad—""

After saying ""Not bad,"" he kept muttering something under his breath, but nothing could be heard.

""It's hopeless. Maruo has gone to another world again.""

""Now that he's like this, he won't be able to come back anytime soon...""

It seems that Maruo's behavior is not particularly strange, but rather happens frequently.

""Generally speaking, you'd feel disappointed, right? If the person you like is a devil.""

""Ah?""

""That's because you lack imagination. Actually, I can't help but want to show you the devilish version of her I imagined. Ah~ so cute~ the devilish Shiina-senpai... I begged her to curse and belittle me, but the words she desperately tried to come up with didn't contain any cursing or belittling at all. Seeing her blushing, I said, 'Okay, you're so cute,' and then hugged her tightly.""

""……horrible""

""I want to see it, just once before I die. I really want to see Shiina-senpai's demon cosplay. I'll seriously add it to my list of things I want to do in my life... I must make Shiina-senpai a demon that belongs only to me.""

""I understand how Maruo feels, but... I also want to see Ichinose-senpai's angel cosplay. No, since it's come to this, a demon cosplay would be fine too. I really want to ask her for help.""

""Even you're like this... no, but so am I...""

Just as he was about to deny it, he seemed to realize that he had the same thought, and nodded with his arms crossed.

The four of them each fantasized about cosplaying as Ichinose and Hiyori as angels and demons, respectively, and were immersed in a blissful mood.

At least to some extent, I am confident that I have a deep understanding of cosplay.

As someone involved in the operation of the maid café at last year's cultural festival, it's essential to understand them.

If both Ichinose and Hiyori agree to wear costumes, the angel and demon cosplay outfits might suit them better than you might imagine.

Of course, even if Ichinose appears to be an angel and Hiyori a devil, this has absolutely nothing to do with their inner good or evil.

Therefore, if Ichinose were to play the devil and Hiyori the angel, this conclusion would naturally hold true as well.

By the way... if we swap outfits in the morning and afternoon, and have the two of them dress up as an angel and a devil at the same time, we might be able to get the same customer to visit the shop twice.

However, this situation must take into account differences in physical build, so exchanging clothing is not an option. Whether the cost can be recovered if twice the amount of clothing is prepared is a matter of debate.

Well, considering the operation of the coffee shop, we should probably need to ensure we have a few more employees...

Wait, wait, wait, I stopped thinking as my mind started to work out calculations.

It's unclear whether there will be a cultural festival this year, and it seems unlikely that a similar special exam will be held, repeating the same theme. As things stand, the possibility of opening a maid café is not high.

Even if I were to continue expanding my delusions now, it would be pointless, so I should just give up.

However, I feel I haven't yet grasped why cosplay is so appealing and what its essence is.

I know that cute people of the opposite sex are more attractive when they wear cute clothes.

However, this is not the knowledge I myself have come to understand deep down, and that is certain.

Perhaps it would be better to deepen my understanding of cosplay. I wonder if I can also develop the same desire within myself as Maruo to want others to wear cosplay costumes.

As planned, I sat for an hour before leaving my seat, where I had a fulfilling and peaceful rest.

1qyel4p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyel4p,Two Weeks In: Raw Thoughts on a Full Reps Bundle,"Picked up this mix last month—wore everything through commutes, errands, and lazy weekends. Zero staging, zero fluff. Just honest notes.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770472987.0,Hoobuy,1,1.0,False

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

1qyefn2,https://i.redd.it/pe48pucfv2ig1.jpeg,Eating out in these counties tier list,"This is my subjective review of eating out in these countries, generally you can get great food everywhere but some places you have to pay a premium especially for international cuisines. Some places I haven't been in years so I'm sure the food scene has changed and improved since.

 

Quality - Taste and hygiene of food. Some places can be a bit ropey.

Value  - Comparing to UK prices, so a lot of places will be cheaper comparatively.  But some place are just outstanding for value I think even the very touristy locations. Some places it is just cheaper to eat out then make it yourself. If the locals are eating out or ordering takeaway multiple times of day it is generally very good value.

Options - Its great eating local options but sometimes you just want a good pizza or burger. Is it just big international chains or do you have lots of small independent family owned places

Convenience - How easy is it, opening hours, queuing wait times/walk ins. I hate having to book or queue, the ability to just order food when you see or smell great food as you are exploring a place is important to me.

 

Australia - Great food options especially pies but very random and they like to sneak random stuff in there, why the hidden BBQ sauce in everything? I hate BBQ sauce!!! Hungry Jacks (Burger King), Bacon double cheese expected no sauce but they snuck BBQ in there and also was ambushed with it as a pizza base. Beetroot in burger ok I suppose. Did I say I hate BBQ sauce.

Belize -Nothing really striking or stands out, some good seafood

Cambodia -Its neighbours just do it better, better options and quality.

Cuba - Worst place for food I've been, very limited and poor quality.  Sanctions have hit hard. You will be paying the tourist tax and a lot of hustle and offers so you don’t get to enjoy your meal in peace.

Czechia - OK, limited

Denmark - Great but expensive

France - Great, can be expensive but decent bargains.

Germany - Nice food, bit heavy good for drinking though.

Greece - Really great food, underrated, expensive where I was I suppose but I was in touristy spots

Guatemala - Pollo Campero! Great and cheap.  Not many international options when I went.

Hong Kong - Great Cantonese food, international options and relatively cheap considering price of everything else

Iraq - Some outstanding food, but limited to secure locations for obvious reasons at the time. Tbf I was probably eating out on the higher end due to work.

Ireland - OK, expensive

Jamaica - Some great food jerk, curried goat, oxtails and patties.  However a bit limited and probably one of the most expensive places to eat out!

Laos - Decent and cheap. Banana Rotis and fresh fruit (tbf everywhere in that region has great fresh food and smoothies)

Malaysia - Massive heavy hitter, fusion of cultures and cuisines. Lots of options and outstanding value.

Mexico - Quality, price and variety. Had the best calamari in random spot

Netherlands - Nothing special and expensive, one of the worst for food in Europe I think.

Nigeria - Some very good food, but quality can be a bit inconsistent.

Philippines - Food generally was very oily and noticeable sweeter than normal. Don’t think I had a decent coffee whilst out there.

Poland - Enjoyed food, good value and interesting food scene options, quality and variety improving rapidly

Portugal - Underrated overshadowed by Spain but just as good if not better. Excellent meat, seafood and pastries at very decent pricings.

South Africa - Very good BBQ, meat and seafood

South Korea - Great options, so convenient.  Not solo friendly

Spain - Great food culture and very reasonable to eat out especially when drinking.

Sri Lanka - Great food, limited international options

Sweden - Lovely food but expensive

Thailand - Amazing local and international options, very good value even in the high end shopping centres Terminal 21 you could get decent meal (portion side a bit smaller) for $2 to $3 from the food courts. Pad Thai is so overrated though.

UK - British food does get made fun off, but it has quality options and lots of international cuisines however pretty expensive. ""Street Food"" is especially a con so expensive for you get a lot of the times. Too many chains.

USA - Mix bag quality can vary, lots and lots of fast food, but so many options but it can be very expensive and tipping culture is insane and service can be a bit too intrusive and fake nice.

Vietnam - Amazing local and international options, very good value. Pretty healthy lots of veg and herbs.",6,1770472592.0,tierlists,1,0.88,False

I picked it up sometime in the 4th or 5th grade off my classroom bookshelf (so circa 2007 - 2008, though the book could obviously be older.) I remember it having a sort of Judy Blume or Louis Sachar coming-of-age vibe. I can only recall two scenes from the entire book, but I remember them in vivid detail.

The first is the opening chapter, in which the main girl's older sister is about to move out. The main girl is excited for the new bedroom she's about to get and is also hoping her big sister might leave something good behind, like her TV or stereo, since she doesn't have her own. I distinctly remember her wiping out the inside of her sister's old dresser drawers with a rag because she ""wants everything spic and span"" when she moves her own stuff in.

In a later scene, the girl sneaks into her parents' bedroom to look at her baby scrapbook. While her older sister's book is super decorated and detailed with a ton of milestones and keepsakes, her own baby book is just a coffee-stained spiral notebook with like one or two entries. This contributes to her feelings of inadequacy and seems to confirm her fears that her parents favor her big sister.

I feel like horses (or maybe an equestrian school) are also somehow involved?? This could be a total red herring and I might be getting this plot mixed up with a completely different book, but I didn't really read horse books so this feels significant. I've got this vague memory of a story arc where the main character eventually comes into her own and discovers she's just as special as her sister after she tames an exceptionally mean horse.

my first time writing a story let me know what you think



I am detective Lloyd of the London police department it’s been 12 years since the prime minister son has disappeared and I’ve been dedicating my whole life to finding him since I owe a debt to the prime minister. 

We have been hard at work locating tracking everything you need but its weird people ramble a lot around me say take your medicine oh you poor thing but I’m a hard cold detective.

Anyway we have been looking for clues near Buckingham Palace where he was last seen my partner scott says we should continue the search tomorrow it’s going to storm very soon. 



But I was determined i found nothing absolutely nothing how could this be why haven’t I found him is this some sort of cruel joke that I can never solve this case I went back to the office and slammed by hands on the desk.



Useless I mutter to myself I’m useless that’s all I’m good for then Scott came into the room and said something weird he said it’s time for your daily tests what is he playing at. 



It’s you Scott isn’t it scott looks confused you kidnapped the prime minister son now you’ll pay I hate you scott I really do now get out of the way I shout then just start rambling nonsense just nonsense I say.



Scott how did you even pass the police academy you’re dumb you’re dumb I’m the one who will solve this murder and repay my debt i look Scott dead in the eyes with just frustration and say 

…..Caretaker POV…..



I‘m George the caretaker for the prime minister he’s gone insane muttering about his detective life it’s been hard on him ever since his son disappeared I hope one day he recovers. 



It’s sad to see such a bright political figure be driven into insanity he would have done great for Britain I remind him to take his daily tests to evaluate his mental state he just keeps going on about his detective persona 



……Prime minister POV……



Look Scott I don’t need any of these tests i need to find the prime minister son just go away as I looked at my papers the picture of the prime minister son I say it looks familiar anyway.



Why does it look familiar I think to myself why do I feel like I can’t accept something no no I will find the prime minister son no matter what it takes I take a sip of my coffee and walk to my car. 

…….Caretaker POV……

The prime minister took his tests but is still droning on and on I wish I could do something to help but what i mean we’ve done all we can.



Is it because he can’t accept the truth that his son was found dead in the river I really wanted to help as much as I can but the prime minister feels impossible to read nowadays.



He‘s just a detective in his mind we hope one day on a fine morning he finally accepts the truth but as for my thoughts I don’t think he ever will as I put the picture of his son next to him to see how he reacts",1,1770472382.0,story,0,1.0,False

I don’t really know how to explain this. I like to read, and so does he. It started there. We’d ask each other what we were reading, then it turned into him bringing me his books. Every time. He always asks what I thought, if I liked it, what parts stayed with me. If I finish one, we end up talking about it, laughing about certain lines or characters like it’s our own little thing.

He’ll come by my office in the morning and ask what book I’m reading now. Every morning. Like it’s part of the routine. And we joke about it who even finishes a book in a day?

I know it sounds small, almost childish, but it doesn’t feel that way.

Sometimes he comes over and asks if I need help, even when I don’t. Sometimes I catch him looking at me and we lock eyes, and he gets nervous looks away, then back again.

Even when he’s talking to other colleagues, I feel it. He’ll be mid-conversation and still look over at me, like he’s checking if I’m there.

When we pass each other, we smile, keep walking, pretend nothing happened. In meetings, I look for his eyes and he’s already looking at me. When I make coffee, sometimes he does it for me. Not every time. Just enough that I notice.

And I wonder if there’s something there, or if I’m imagining it. And if things go left, I could leave. I don’t even like this job anyway.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

1qye7ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1qye7ik/ive_crapped_my_pants_at_least_3_times_in_my_adult/,I've crapped my pants at least 3 times in my adult life.,"Everyone's got a shit story. Both my coworkers and my friend group seem to share them often - either they've dropped trou in public, or they've mistrusted a fart, or they've been caught short while ill.

I've shit my pants a few times. 3 times, to be specific.

**Age 23:**

Drank a coffee before going out on a morning run. Felt everything drop about half way through the run. Tried to waddle my way to the closest public bathroom, knew I wouldn't make. Looked around for a nearby ally, couldn't see any hidden enough.

Got to the point where a little bit started to inch out. Clenched up and managed to stop it there. Made it a few steps, and a bit more came out. And then a bit more. And then a bit more. Eventually I thought, alright, this is hopeless, and let the rest go. Swear to god, felt like I was shitting for at least 30 seconds.

Was wearing compression shorts - these kind of running tights, tight on the leg - underneath my shorts. They caught everything. A bit of a blessing, as it wasn't going down my leg, but it now felt like I was wearing a completely loaded diaper. Had to waddle home the rest of the way, another 10 minutes, hiding my ass from strangers walking by so they wouldn't see the shorts bulge.

Avoided my girlfriend coming home, got into the shower, and tossed the shorts into the bin.

**Age 28:**

Left work, had to take a massive shit but thought I'd wait until I was safely at home to let it go.

Ended up shitting my pants in my car stuck in surprise traffic on the way home. 4lbs of semi-solids, had to sit on a very much homemade pillow for another 40 minutes driving home. Absolutely vile. Thankfully I was alone in my car, so wasn't necessarily as humiliating as it could've been, but there's a sensation of sitting on top of a pile that I never want to repeat again in my life.

Got home, grabbed the back of my legs while walking so nothing would slide down my jeans, and got back into my house for a shower.

**Age 31:**

About a month ago now. Coming home after work drinks at the office. Felt the need to take a monumental dump half way home on the tube (London Underground, for non-brits.) Managed to maintain my composure right up until my stop. Stepped off onto the platform, and just absolutely let loose.

It was quite late at night, around 1am, so there wasn't anything open. Had to walk 30 minutes back home with a shit the size of a grapefruit in my boxer briefs. Shit again half way through the walk as well. Thankfully because it was late there weren't many people out in public, so I didn't have to suffer the stares of the public.

Honestly, unsure which scenario was worse - but if you've shit your pants before, just know:

Another day, I had a short, normal conversation with one of her friends in the library (just small talk about what we study, work, etc.).   
  
During that conversation I mentioned that I wasn’t sure how to ask her out. Two or three days later, I gave that same friend a short note to pass along. The note said I’d like to take her out for coffee and that she could text me if she was interested. I was trying to keep it low-pressure and respectful.   
  
It’s now been 3 days and I haven’t heard anything, so I’m not planning to follow up and I’m prepared to take it as a no. I’m more interested in learning than salvaging anything. Before yesterday, I ran into her and her friend at the library. I said “hi guys” and waved in passing, and they said hi back but she sort of avoided eye contact. As we walked past each other, I heard them giggle.   
  
About 2 hours later I run into them again on the same open area and decided to strike up a convo and noticed she started standing behind her friend while I was in the same space and she was looking at the floor.   
  
I might be overthinking it, but it felt notable. At the same time, they keep coming to the same areas I’m at but dont sit beside or in front of me anymore, which makes me think they don’t feel uncomfortable around me.

Sometimes, I’ll sit down and out of nowhere won’t be able to stand the sight of my favorite foods without feeling nauseous, or I’ll find myself eating only very few simple things because everything else turns my stomach from just thinking about it. It’s like, I swear, coffee or spices that I liked once even the smell of them triggers this thing.

Andit’s not only the nausea; it’s the feeling of anxiety, and fear, that works its way into my chest as I sit down with every meal and think to myself, “What if this is wrong?” That may sound goofy, but when something that’s supposed to nourish me creates a sense of anxiety, emotionally it runs deep… Why is this very food I’m eating causing me stress?

I found an article describing this type of food aversion and nausea as very common during pregnancy, resulting from hormonal changes and the body's adaptation to the growing fetus. This doesn't mean there's anything wrong with us; it's simply how our bodies sometimes respond.

Interesting patterns emerged that might be useful for anyone building in the creator economy space.

The Problem Pattern:

Most creators managing 5+ brand deals simultaneously are using:

	∙	Notion boards (manually updated, no reminders)

	∙	Google Calendar (gets cluttered, easy to miss)

	∙	Spreadsheets (forget to check them)

	∙	Phone reminders (swipe away and forget)

Real Examples of Broken Workflows:

	∙	Forgot to invoice for 3 weeks → payment delayed by a month

	∙	Missed deliverable deadline → brand ghosted them for future deals

	∙	No tracking of usage rights → brands using content beyond agreement period

	∙	Broken affiliate links not monitored → lost revenue

What They Actually Need:

Based on the research, the core pain isn’t organization - it’s revenue protection.

Creators don’t think “I need better organization.” They think “I just lost $800 because I forgot to send an invoice.”

The Insight for SaaS Builders:

If you’re building for creators, position around preventing revenue loss, not “better productivity.”

Wrong: “Organize your brand deals”Right: “Stop losing money to missed deadlines and late payments”

Pricing Question:

For a tool that automates payment reminders, deliverable alerts, and usage rights tracking - what’s the impulse-buy threshold for individual creators?

My hypothesis: $15/month (cheaper than Notion Pro, more than Netflix)Alternative: $10/month to stay under “coffee money” psychology

Curious what others think about prosumer SaaS pricing in this market.

1qydtrt,https://i.redd.it/y0r5b6m5r2ig1.jpeg,Honest Review of the Pistachio Vanilla Pods…,"My first sleeve just came in the mail so i immediately ripped it open like an animal and popped it into my Nespresso Delonghi. I figured I’ll try it the way it was intended over ice. It definitely had a sweet pistachio smell while it was brewing as i shoved my nose close to sniff. The only creamer I have is the Barissimo French Vanilla from Aldi which I frothed in a separate cup and poured it on top. Gave a little stir, had a little sippy sip, and here are my thoughts: 

There have been so many mixed reviews so I was hesitant about the flavor before trying. The only flavor that I can think is comparable to this initial flavor is the pistachio flavored ice cream from Carvel. Specifically the flying saucers. If you’ve ever had those before in your life, that is the closest comparison I can give you.

I can see how others have said it’s very artificial flavored because well….it is 😅 but it’s a more in your face flavor rather than an undertone of the coffee if that makes sense. So the divide between people on this pod is totally fair!! Everyone’s taste buds and flavor tolerances are different. I do wish it was more of an undertone instead of having such a strong flavor. 

The more I sip, the more that carvel ice cream flavor goes away. I think it’s possibly a bit tooooo sweet with the French vanilla creamer I used (only one I had) so I’d like to try it again tomorrow but with the chobani extra creamy oat milk. I’ve heard the oat flavor brings out the more “nuttiness” of the drink and doesn’t make it as sweet. I don’t think I’m not going to go crazy with syrups, pistachio butter, etc. or some other things I’ve read to do but i heard a touch of honey and some brown sugar is delish! If anyone has any suggestions for other concoctions, do let me know below!! 

IN CONCLUSION, i would currently give this overall 7.5/10. I’ll touch base with everyone when I try my new creamer and let you know if it’s better (or worse 😅)

1qydrx2,https://i.redd.it/x4gyjxcqq2ig1.jpeg,[Haul] 3 weeks of real wear: 8 pieces that actually lived with me,"After subway commutes, spilled coffee, and one rainy Tuesday that tested everything—I’m sharing exactly how these held up. Zero brand ties. Just honest notes.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

Clothes don’t need to be perfect. Just need one reason you reach for them again.

Originally I was looking at the HU burrs with the Z1 as a good fit for my profile. With that said, I’d love to experiment a bit more so I’m not against the CV3 burrs… but will I be able to pull reasonably decent shots with medium and dark roasts? Everything I’ve found on forums suggests the CV3 can be really finicky (but also, it may just be a seasoning issue). Would love some thoughts from CV3 users who’ve at least given it a go on darker roasts before I buy another set of burrs. Thanks!

1qydl9e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qydl9e,Single Shot Residue Issue Fix,"I remember a few weeks back, someone was asking about getting cleaner single shots out of the system. It took me some time to figure stuff out, but this is what I do for clean shots.

Biggest difference I've found is the strength setting. In the two pictures, the first is strength setting 1 and the second picture is strength setting 3. Both pictures are right after pulling the shot and dumping the puck. This leads me to believe that the single shot basket tends to like more water rather than less.  
  
I've found that if I've accidently left it on strength 3, I can run another shot and get similar results as if I had just done strength 1 from the get-go. 

I've also found that letting it cool some results in cleaner pucks. If I take the time to foam the milk and finish making my coffee leaving cleaning the basket for last, it usually comes out cleaner than if I remove it immediately after pulling a shot.

Hopefully this helps those like me who like the single shots.

Single shots are important to me and one of the biggest reasons I got the 701 over the 601. I'm happy to have found that I actually prefer the taste of the low strength single shot over a high strength single shot.",3,1770470309.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,3,1.0,False

(I'll write in English so more people can read comfortably. Anyway, is there something like a group chat for new folks in Lübeck?) 

I'm Clemens, 30, from Southern Germany and I will be in Lübeck for 4 months, probably. I don't know a single soul here so I'm open to visitors, well-wishers or distant relations. Frankly, I'm looking for people to bond with over memes and Deutsche Bahn experiences. The occasional drink and a laugh are more than welcome, too.

I'm an IT guy because, well, this is reddit, doh. More importantly though, I'm into music, movies, theater and art. I play slooow Post Rock or fast Prog on guitars, I used to sail and I recently got a diving license. I could probably still ride a skateboard without breaking my neck, too. All of these things would be even nicer to share with others, so say hi if they sound good to you. 

And of course I run, I'm 30. But I did not get into bicycles or coffee. Yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------

L-shaped barndominiums have become popular for their unique designs and functional layouts. They combine the charm of a barn with modern living essentials, perfect for families or anyone seeking a spacious, flexible home environment. If you’re considering building or redesigning a space using this style, innovative floor plans can significantly enhance your living experience.

One key benefit of L-shaped designs is their space efficiency. The layout naturally divides the home into distinct areas, allowing for greater privacy without feeling closed off. For instance, one leg of the L can be dedicated to living areas—like the kitchen, dining room, and living room—while the other leg can house the bedrooms and bathrooms. This separation can be a game-changer for families who value both connection and personal space.

Here are some creative L-shaped barndominium floor plan ideas:

- **Open Concept Living Space:** An L-shaped floor plan allows for a roomy, open-concept living area. Picture a large kitchen that flows effortlessly into a dining space, which leads into a comfortable living room. High ceilings and large windows bring in natural light, enhancing the overall ambiance.
- **Split Bedroom Arrangement:** Arrange the bedrooms on opposite ends of the L-shape. This design ensures that parents and kids have their own space, reducing noise and maintaining privacy. You could also incorporate en-suite bathrooms or shared bathrooms with easy access from each bedroom.
- **Outdoor Connection:** Utilize the bend in the L to create a connected outdoor space. This could be a patio area or a deck that is accessible from both the living room and the master suite. Ideal for gatherings or peaceful retreats, it enhances your home's accessibility to nature and outdoor living.
- **Multi-Purpose Areas:** One potential advantage of using the L shape is adding multi-purpose rooms. Consider an area that's designed as a guest suite, home office, or playroom that can easily change function as your needs evolve.
- **Sleek Storage Solutions:** The unique layout of an L-shaped barndominium allows for creative storage solutions like built-in shelves or cabinets in less-used corners. This can help maintain a clutter-free environment while maximizing space and keeping everything organized.

When you think about innovative L-shaped barndominium floor plans, consider how you can personalize your space to fit your lifestyle. elements like vaulted ceilings, skylights, or modern fixtures can elevate the look without sacrificing the functional design.

Another exciting feature of L-shaped barndominiums is their adaptability to different environments. For instance, you can easily modulate the plans to suit rural, suburban, or even urban settings. It’s worth noting how the design can fit into various lot sizes and orientations, ensuring that you can make the most of your available land.

Focusing on energy-efficient materials and sustainable practices can be impactful as well. Use insulated walls, energy-saving windows, and efficient heating and cooling systems to lower your energy bills and environmental footprint. Many people find that with the right planning, an L-shaped barndominium can naturally be eco-friendly.

Additionally, think about the interior decor reflecting modern trends. Neutral color palettes combined with unique furnishings can craft a contemporary feel, while vintage accents can maintain the barn charm. Elements like sliding barn doors or exposed beams can bridge the gap between modern aesthetics and rustic styles, offering a cozy yet sleek appearance.

With so many creative possibilities, the dimensions of L-shaped barndominium floor plans allow for a variety of design options. Whether you want an expansive family gathering space, a peaceful retreat, or simply a comfortable home, innovative designs can cater to your needs. Embrace this unique approach to homebuilding, and transform your vision into reality.

Tips for Maximizing Space in L-Shaped Barndominium Designs
----------------------------------------------------------

When designing an L-shaped barndominium, maximizing the available space is essential for functionality and comfort. This unique layout provides various opportunities to create a cozy yet spacious environment. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your L-shaped barndominium design.

### Open Concept Living

Embrace an open-concept layout to enhance the flow and feel of your home. By combining living, dining, and kitchen areas, you eliminate barriers that can make spaces feel cramped. This design choice not only encourages interaction but also makes it easier to furnish and decorate, optimizing your overall space usage.

### Multi-Functional Rooms

Think about rooms that can serve multiple purposes. For instance, a home office can double as a guest room with the addition of a sleeper sofa or a murphy bed. By designing rooms that can change function based on your needs, you’ll be able to adjust your space without the need for additional square footage.

### Optimize Vertical Space

L-shaped barndominiums often come with high ceilings, which provide an opportunity to utilize vertical space. Consider installing tall cabinetry in the kitchen and living areas to take advantage of this height. Use shelves that go all the way up to the ceiling or consider adding decorative elements like hanging plants or artwork to draw the eye upward.

### Creative Storage Solutions

Storage is a key component to keeping your L-shaped barndominium organized. Here are some effective strategies:

- **Built-in Furniture:** Opt for built-in shelves, benches, or tables that maximize floor space while providing storage.
- **Under-stair Storage:** If your design includes stairs, use the space underneath for storage solutions, like cabinets or a small pantry.
- **Hidden Compartments:** Consider furniture with hidden storage, such as ottomans or coffee tables, to maintain a clutter-free environment.

### Defined Zones

Another efficient way to maximize space is to create clearly defined zones within your L-shaped barndominium. Use area rugs or furniture arrangements to delineate spaces for different activities. For example, a cozy reading nook can be established in a corner with a chaise lounge and a side table. This separation allows you to maintain an open feel while still having designated areas for specific functions.

### Natural Light and Views

Enhancing the feeling of space doesn’t just rely on layout. Consider how natural light plays a role in your design. Large windows, sliding glass doors, or transom windows can flood your living areas with light, making the space feel airy and open. If you have views outside, orient your living area towards them. This can create a seamless indoor-outdoor living experience, contributing to the overall spacious feel.

### Color and Decoration Choices

The color palette and decoration choices also significantly impact the perceived space in your barndominium. Light colors can make rooms appear larger and more inviting. You can use whites, light grays, or soft pastels for walls and larger furniture pieces. Additionally, incorporating mirrors can reflect light and create an illusion of added space.

### Flex Spaces

Designing flex spaces is another great way to make your L-shaped barndominium functional without overcrowding it. A room can transition from a playroom to a workout space or even an arts and crafts room, depending on your family’s needs. Use foldable furniture or movable partitions to enhance this adaptability.

### Landscaping and Outdoor Living

Don’t forget about outdoor space. A well-planned outdoor area can extend your living space beyond the walls of your barndominium. Patios, decks, or even simple seating areas in your yard can provide more room for relaxation and recreation, making your L-shaped home feel expansive and connected to nature.

Designing an L-shaped barndominium offers unique opportunities to creatively maximize your space. By implementing these tips, you can create a home that feels open, functional, and tailored specifically to your lifestyle. Whether you’re looking to blend indoor and outdoor living, make rooms multifunctional, or enhance storage solutions, thoughtful design choices will make your barndominium a comfortable and enjoyable place to live.

### Conclusion

Embracing the innovative designs of L-shaped barndominiums opens the door to a modern lifestyle that blends functionality and style seamlessly. These innovative floor plans not only cater to a diverse range of family needs but also enhance the overall aesthetic of your living space. With an L-shaped layout, you can create distinct zones for living, working, and relaxing, making it perfect for contemporary families seeking flexible living solutions.

Maximizing space in these unique designs is key to ensuring comfort and utility. open concepts, multi-functional furniture, and strategic storage solutions can help you make the most of every square foot. By thoughtfully considering the flow and layout, you can create inviting spaces that foster connection while still providing privacy when needed.

As you embark on your barndominium journey, think about how these creative build options can fit your lifestyle. Whether you prefer a cozy nook for some quiet time or an expansive area for entertaining, the versatility of L-shaped floor plans provides endless possibilities. By using these strategies, you can cultivate an environment that not only reflects your unique style but also supports your daily activities and aspirations.

Investing time in understanding the nuances of L-shaped designs will pay off in a space that is not only functional but also a joy to live in. Your barndominium can be a true haven—one that showcases innovation and comfort while embracing the beauty of modern living. The right design and space maximization strategies can transform your vision into a reality, creating a home where memories are made for years to come.",1,1770469899.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

# 

While the [holiday season](https://amzonestep.com/blog/top-10-ecommerce-strategies-for-holiday-season-that-your-brand-cant-afford-to-ignore/) might be coming to an end, you should not let your Amazon sales strategy suffer for it. It is while the shoppers are taking a break, the sellers who understand the opportunities capture this time and review their listings for the upcoming year. 

# 

This is the opportune moment to improve the product titles, update the descriptions, and enrich the images in order to increase the visibility and the conversion rate.

# 

Consider it as a chance to press the reset button and review the aspects that were effective during the peak period and those that require modification. Therefore, it is crucial to make the necessary changes now to ensure that you have better sales, higher ranking, and quite competitive when the demand comes back. 

# 

Are you eager to make the most out of this relatively calm period and bring your Amazon brand to the new level? Here we present the most effective strategies to refresh your listings!

# 

# A+ Content for a Professional Amazon Look

# 

# Develop a Compelling Brand Story

# 

Remember that customers only buy from trustworthy brands, and a good [brand story](https://amzonestep.com/blog/why-your-amazon-brand-story-matters-more-than-your-product-specs/) can help you differ from the competitors. Using the A+ Content “Brand Story” module, retailers can communicate their journey, values and mission, creating increases in credibility and emotional connections with shoppers.

# 

# Why It Matters

# 

A [brand story](https://amzonestep.com/blog/why-is-amazons-brand-story-significant-for-your-brand/) establishes trust and makes your brand feel more relatable. If potential customers are clear on the vision for your products, they’re more likely to select your brand than a competitor’s.

# 

# How to Do It Right

# 

* Begin with your mission: Tell us why you started your brand.
*  
* Highlight important milestones: Demonstrate brand achievements and awards.
*  
* Include genuine images: Share photos from behind the scenes or a team introduction.
*  
* Make it short and sweet: Use a few short paragraphs—audience-focused, not you-focused.

# 

# Example

# 

For example, a sustainable skincare brand that sells organic face serums could use A+ Content to provide details about its eco-friendly mission. The of writing off their use of recyclable packaging, a timeline of their journey, and an image of their founder explaining why she decided to create clean beauty products.

# 

Telling a story, customers can identify with can create brand loyalty and lead to conversion. In a world where shoppers are more inclined to support [Amazon FBA brands](https://amzonestep.com/blog/what-amazon-resources-empower-amazon-fba-brands/) they connect with, the Brand Story module is an invaluable asset to A+ Content.

# 

# Why Use High Quality Lifestyle Images 

# 

Good quality **listing images** are so important to purchase decisions. Whereas product images on a white background are usual, [lifestyle images](https://amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) that demonstrate real-world usage give customers a sense of how it may fit into their everyday life.

# 

# Why It Matters

# 

Lifestyle images provide context, size and function of a product, and an emotional connection. Amazon shoppers are more likely to purchase from listings that use relatable use-case scenarios.

# 

# How to Do It Right:

# 

* Use some great examples: Show the product in action.
*  
* Diversity of backgrounds: Pick settings similar to your audience.
*  
* Keep high resolution: Clear and professional-looking images

# 

Visually highlight the key benefits: Rather than using heavy text to explain product value, allow **listing images** to do the talking.

# 

# Example

# 

For example, an **Amazon FBA** seller of yoga mats may include lifestyle images of a person practicing on the mat in a studio or at home. Instead of just showing the rolled-up mat, the images can showcase a couple of yoga postures, non-slip grip, and the comfortable thickness.

# 

Including lifestyle images adds a 3D shopping experience that helps shoppers visualize the product in their lives. This can result in increased likelihood of engagement and conversion rates.

# 

# Use Infographics to Highlight Its Key Features 

# 

There are also [Amazon infographics](https://amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-infographics/) that get your product benefits across quickly. They pair graphics with short text, which make information easier to digest.

# 

# Why It Matters

# 

In fact, most shoppers don’t read [product descriptions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/amazon-debuts-generative-ai-tools-that-helps-sellers-write-product-descriptions/). Just make sure you choose to highlight the most important product aspects in an easy and understandable format.

# 

# How to Do It Right

# 

* New design with simple icons and graphics: Show features through visual representations rather than text only
*  
* Text should be short and impactful: Not lengthy descriptions.
*  
* Avoid overusing color contrast: Color contrast is a great way to emphasize certain points but pick moments to use it strategically so as not to confuse the viewer.
*  
* So zero in on the headline benefits: things that are most important to customers.

# 

# Example

# 

For example, a noise-canceling headphones seller might use an infographic to explain:

# 

* Battery life: “40 hours on a single charge” followed by an icon of a battery.
*  
* Sound quality: “Premium HD audio,” with a speaker icon
*  
* Bluetooth range: “Seamless connectivity up to 30 feet” along with a Wi-Fi signal icon.

# 

Infographics serve as a visual aid to condense and communicate information clearly. Bringing it to a more customer-level engagement and higher conversions

# 

A comparison chart lets you showcase your product’s benefits over the competition in a straightforward, side-by-side comparison. That helps customers easily see why your product is better.

# 

# Why It Matters

# 

When consumers are shopping, they often explore many products before they buy. A well-laid-out comparison chart can save them time, and this can also sway the decision in your favor.

# 

# How to Do It Right

# 

* Select comparison factors that make sense: Decide on the elements that can set your product apart.
*  
* Design with clarity: The less clutter, the easier it is to read the information.
*  
* Show your strengths: Always keep your product distinct in the chart.
*  
* Price vs general market standards — no mentioning competitor product names to comply with Amazon policies

# 

A laptop **Amazon FBA** seller can create a chart:

# 

|**Feature**|**Our Laptop**|
|:-|:-|
|**Battery Life**|12 hours|
|**Display**|4K Ultra HD|
|**Weight**|Lightweight (2.5 lbs)|

# 

# Leverage Customer Testimonials and Reviews

# 

Reviews are critical in building trust, and displaying positive testimonials in A+ Content can add further substance to the reviews and influence buying decisions. Customers don’t really trust retailers when they say their products are good, and the social proof factor works in their favor here, especially buying brands on Earth. 

# 

# How to Use Customer Testimonials Effectively

# 

 Sellers should not only include them in their product descriptions, but they should also keep in mind to highlight the specific benefits a customer gained from the product according to a review; use reviews from verified buyers for credibility, and present them in a readable way, with **listing images** where possible, print. 

# 

* A fitness equipment brand can showcase a testimonial of a customer who lost weight using their treadmill, along with some before and after images. Using Positive Reviews in [A+ Content](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-resolve-a-content-upload-issues-on-amazon-fba/) helps gain more trust from short priced buyers.

# 

# Use CTA (Call-to-action) Elements

# 

A strong call to action (CTA) emphasizes what you want the customer to do next, whether that is purchase, sign up for updates, or discover more about the product. Many buyers need some direction before completing a purchase, and a good CTA can change the game. 

# 

* In this regard, **Amazon FBA** sellers should make sure that their CTA is action-oriented, with words like “Buy Now,” “Upgrade Your Experience,” or “Limited-Time Offer,” and that they are placed within the content for the most impact, and mention urgency when possible. 
*  
* For instance, an electronics seller might use a CTA such as “Order Today and Get Free Shipping” to motivate customers to buy right away. Effective Call To Action (CTA) drives better conversion and sales performance.

# 

# Test Your A+ Content with an A/B Test

# 

Even top A+ Content will likely require some tweaks to reach peak performance. A/B testing (split testing) is a method where **Amazon FBA** sellers may use to compare multiple versions of their content to see which performs better.

# 

 Sellers can test various **listing images**, text and layouts to determine what optimizes for higher conversions. 

# 

* For sustainable A/B testing, sellers need to modify a single factor at a time, use Amazon’s “Manage Your Experiments” tool to create A/B tests if eligible, analyze results relative to engagement and conversion rates, and add any successful elements for the long term. 

# 

Such as a skincare brand that tests two versions of A+ Content — one featuring an infographic showcasing top ingredients and the other featuring a before-after comp. If the before-and-after performs better, the Amazon FBA seller can use that as the final product. 

# 

The real customer data from A/B testing allows sellers to refine and enhance their listings to engage their targeted audience more effectively and ultimately stimulate higher sales.

# 

# Remove Irrelevant Keywords

# 

# Identify Non-Converting Keywords

# 

These keywords are search terms that generate clicks to an [Amazon listing](https://amzonestep.com/blog/essential-steps-for-amazon-sellers-after-launching-an-amazon-listing/) but result in no purchases. While these keywords can get views, if they don’t convert viewers into buyers, they damage the overall performance of the listing. 

# 

To find these types of keywords, **Amazon FBA** sellers can pull Amazon’s Search Term Report in Seller Central. This report shows you the keywords pulling in clicks but not purchases. 

# 

This means that either there is no intent between these two groups, in which case the target audience is inappropriately defined, or the keyword is not applicable to a huge proportion of the target audience.

# 

* For instance, let’s say a seller was selling luxury leather handbags. If their product is being shown to budget-conscious shoppers without the keyword “cheap handbags,” which filters out the budgeted shoppers, their product is still getting exposure but at the cost of extra ad money spent in vain on these shoppers who will never buy an expensive bag. 

# 

Other customers will click on the listing, but see the price and move on, which can hurt conversion rates. To remedy this, the seller should delete “cheap” from its backend search terms and instead optimize for words like “genuine leather handbags” or “designer handbag for women.”

# 

This includes sellers cutting out ineffective keywords. Both ensure higher conversion and higher listing ranking on amazon. A product with a high conversion rate tells Amazon’s algorithm that it is a relevant and valuable product, and therefore stands a better chance of getting higher placements in search results.

# 

 To continue attracting the right customers, sellers need to frequently monitor keyword performance and remove non performing terms to keep their listing well optimized.

# 

# Avoid Generic Terms That Lack Buying Intent

# 

Generic keywords might get you traffic, but not serious buyers. Searches for “best shoes” or “good laptop” are too generic and lack the intent of actual buyers. Shoppers looking for those types of terms are often in the research phase of the buying journey, not necessarily ready to buy. 

# 

To boost sales, **Amazon FBA** sellers need to optimize these vague keywords with more targeted, high-intent phrases.

# 

* For instance, a seller wants to sell gaming laptops might specify instead of using couch words like “good laptop,” they might use product-related, purchase intent keywords such as “high-performance gaming laptop” or “laptop with RTX graphics card.” These phrases appeal to buyers who are already aware of their needs, making them the conversion-catalyst step.

# 

Most of all, Amazon’s search algorithm favors listings that match a customer’s intent to buy. 

# 

* For example, if an **Amazon FBA** seller uses generic keywords they may have their listing display in search results for unrelated questions which results in less engagement and fewer sales.) Moreover, popular keywords are also highly competitive and smaller sellers will often find it difficult to compete with established brands.

# 

Instead of going after generic keywords, sellers should conduct keyword research to identify terms that mirror customer intent. Amazon FBA sellers can fine-tune keyword strategy based on intent-based search terms to improve their relevant listing and attract the target ready-to-purchase customers for sales.

# 

# Eliminate Keywords Which Mislead the Customer About the Product

# 

Using ambiguous language in Amazon product descriptions will result in the wrong buyers getting interested which produces higher rates of returns as well as bad reviews that decrease page position. 

# 

Each keyword in your [Amazon listing](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-small-amazon-listing-tweaks-can-lead-to-big-sales/) should precisely depict the product’s characteristics as well as technical details. The use of incorrect terms by **Amazon FBA** sellers attracts faulty customers who end up unsatisfied with their purchase when reality differs from expectations.

# 

* When a wired gaming mouse includes the search term “wireless” in its listing it will appear in results for wireless mouse queries. Customers who seek a wireless option will likely click the listing for a Bluetooth-enabled product. 

# 

Customers will usually provide poor feedback or choose item return or non-purchase after they discover the product uses wires. The user experience deteriorates while the algorithm receives signals that indicate the listing does not match the search terms.

# 

Sellers should conduct consistent keyword checks and remove terms which fail to accurately represent their products. Sellers need to concentrate on showing their products’ real specifications rather than attempting to reach broad consumer groups. 

# 

Sellers who use proper keywords in an authentic way establish customer loyalty and boost sales because their targeted customer base effectively discovers appropriate products.

# 

# Eliminate Outdated or Seasonal Keywords

# 

Seasonal keywords function excellently during targeted periods yet destroy visibility after seasons conclude. The market value of keywords tagged to event-specific listings decreases when such events finish. 

# 

* For example holiday items like “Christmas gift for kids” or “Black Friday deals” put specific keywords into disuse. Product listings that contain obsolete search terms will receive lower search rankings from Amazon’s system because they attract customers who are no longer interested.

# 

During cold months sellers of winter coats market their products using the keyword “best winter jackets for extreme cold”. When season transitions take place the total number of customers searching for winter jackets declines. 

# 

The visibility of a listing declines when **Amazon FBA** sellers neglect to update their key phrases which impacts its ability to attract suitable traffic. The sellers should shift their search phrases toward “lightweight spring jackets” and “windproof jackets for spring” which better match contemporary consumer interests.

# 

Physical store success depends on continuous monitoring of market trends followed by keyword adjustments. By analyzing data from search volume tools such as Google Trends and Amazon the seller can spot declining popular seasonal keywords and make needed updates in their listings.

# 

 Strategic updates to keywords help maintain product usability so it attracts customers throughout the entire year.

# 

# Eliminate Irrelevant Brand Names

# 

Listing keywords that include competitor brand names may seem like a way to bring in more traffic, but it may have the opposite effect. Amazon’s guidelines restrict **Amazon FBA** sellers from including another brand name in their own backend search terms — list abuse on this count could see listings suppressed or penalized. 

# 

* For example, if a seller is selling generic wireless earbuds, having words like “Apple AirPods” or “Bose headphones” in the backend keywords may help bring shoppers who are looking for those brands. 

# 

When customers receive these products and see they are not Apple or Bose products, they may feel tricked and post a review. This damages the listing’s credibility and also raises returns.

# 

* Sellers should emphasise what sets their products apart instead of competitor names. If the earbuds come with features like noise cancellation or long battery life, keywords such as “noise-canceling wireless earbuds,” and “long-lasting Bluetooth earbuds” will draw the right audience without any confusion. 

# 

Transparency is key in both ensuring compliance with Amazon’s policies and maintaining trust and satisfaction with your customers.

# 

# Remove Unnecessary Synonyms and Repetitive Keywords

# 

[Amazon’s A9 algorithm](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-feed-amazon-a9-algorithm-during-product-launch/) automatically takes different versions of keywords into account, so there is no need to build out 100 synonyms for keywords or repeat keywords excessively. Stuffing backend search terms with similar words occupies precious real estate that could be used for more relevant keywords.

# 

* So for instance, a seller listing a “waterproof hiking backpack” doesn’t have to add all of those variations like “hiking backpack waterproof,” “waterproof backpack for hiking,” and “It’s All About a backpack hiking waterproof.” Amazon already knows these are related terms.

# 

 **Amazon FBA** sellers will need to leverage other relevant keywords, such as “lightweight trekking backpack” or “durable outdoor backpack,” to increase their opportunities.

# 

But on the other side, if your listing is repetitive, it is too spammy. Instead of repeating “best laptop for students,” sellers should use alternatives, including “affordable student laptop” or “lightweight college laptop.” The well-planned and clean keyword strategy follows an optimized approach for making the listing visible without disturbing the user flow.

# 

# Eliminate Poorly Performing PPC Keywords

# 

[Amazon Pay-Per-Click (PPC](https://amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-amazon-ppc-strategies-for-maximizing-your-advertising-roi/)) campaigns help you understand keyword performance — as in, which keywords convert sales and which do not. PPC performance reports should be checked regularly, and poorly performing keywords should be removed from listings. 

# 

If these keywords see a lot of clicks but fail to result in sales, they can sour both organic rankings and advertising ROI.

# 

* For example, if a **Amazon FBA** seller places an advertisement for “Bluetooth speakers in $30” that receives a very high click-through-rate, but not conversion, then obviously the expectation for the product does not match customer expectation. 
*  
* Targeting this keyword creates wasted spend, and minimizes profitability on the whole. Instead, more effective search keywords for the seller to use might include phrases like “compact wireless speakers ” or “budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers” which better reflect what customers are searching for.

# 

This can significantly enhance their sales performance as removing low-performing PPC keywords and concentrating on high-converting terms can improve the efficiency of paid campaigns and boost organic search ranking.

# 

Some keywords are strictly prohibited by Amazon guidelines. While creating their content, sellers must ensure not to use restricted terms like false claims, medical benefits, prohibited product descriptions, etc.

# 

* For example, a seller of supplements may not use words such as “cures arthritis” or “guaranteed weight loss” because Amazon allows medical claims only with F.D.A. approval. Gen-y does not allow the use of promotional language in listings, so words like “free shipping” or “best price” should not be part of backend search terms, either.

# 

# Optimize for Amazon SEO Algorithm Updates

# 

# Focus on High-Intent Keywords

# 

Amazon algorithms A9 and A10 position listings which match specified buyer intent criteria because these terms indicate readiness to make purchases. Sellers achieve better visibility and conversion rates through their efforts on high-intent keyword selection. 

# 

The consumer seeking “best waterproof Bluetooth speakers for beach use” requires a particular product which must provide both durability and portability features. 

# 

* The use of search keywords such as “waterproof Bluetooth speakers for beach” strengthens the probability that buyers will discover the product while searching for purchasing options at the beach.
*  
* Through the use of special search tools **Amazon FBA** sellers can select appropriate long-tail keywords that match their targeted customers’ precise search needs. Products should use specific descriptions such as “best portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker for travel” instead of generic terms “Bluetooth speaker.”

# 

A natural readable flow throughout the listing must be maintained at all times. The use of excessive repeating keywords through keyword stuffing destroys both the readability along with the customer’s overall experience between seller and buyer. 

# 

Refining your product list to meet search engine requirements must not overshadow creating a valuable experience for prospective buyers so you need to strike a careful measure. Targeting high-intent essential terms helps sellers find suitable audience matches and improves both product visibility and conversion chances.

# 

# Prioritize Backend Keywords for Better Indexing

# 

The search engine of Amazon uses Backend keywords as secret terms which make products searchable. The algorithm relies on these secret keywords which the product page does not reveal to find matching search queries. 

# 

The strategic use of backend keywords enables massive visibility growth though sellers need to implement them properly.

# 

Amazon supports 250 backend search terms yet **Amazon FBA** sellers should prevent duplicate keywords from title content as well as bullet points and product description content. Including “wireless headphones” within the product title makes further inclusion of this phrase in backend keywords unnecessary. 

# 

* A seller should focus on putting related terms and variations within backend search terms. A product such as Bluetooth headphones requires backend keywords including “noise-canceling Bluetooth earphones,” “over-ear wireless headphones,” and “wireless stereo headphones for working out” to maximize search query coverage.
*  
* Sellers commonly make the error of including excessive irrelevant keywords within their search term backend. The use of terms such as “best” or “cheap” typically proves useless because they conflict with Amazon’s system guidelines and trigger algorithmic detection. 

# 

The search system on Amazon identifies equivalent words and phrases therefore Amazon FBA sellers do not need to use the same term repeatedly to rank their products. Each backend search term should include different specific phrases which will expand the potential for appearing in additional search results.

# 

Exploring an appropriate set of backend keywords allows sellers to boost their product discovery levels while following Amazon’s platform regulations. The improved indexing ability lets sellers get ranked for multiple relevant search inquiries.

# 

# Optimize Product Titles with a Balance of Keywords and Readability

# 

[Amazon listings](https://amzonestep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing-your-amazon-listings/) receive their main performance boost from the product title which stands as a crucial element in their rankings. The combination of targeted keywords with text that customers can easily understand produces superior rankings and click-through rates (CTR) in an efficient title. 

# 

Both appropriate keywords and simple readable customer-engaging content need to exist in one title. Amazon provides limited character count for titles yet **Amazon FBA** sellers should maximize their word choice in this space. The optimal title for a wireless vacuum cleaner should appear as follows:

# 

**“XYZ Cordless Vacuum Cleaner – 22 Kpa Suction Power, Lightweight, 2-in-1 for Home & Car Use”**

# 

* The product title sneaks in essential keywords “cordless vacuum cleaner” plus “suction power” and “lightweight” yet adds useful information about being “2-in-1 for home & car use” to attract prospective customers. 

# 

The title combines customer-oriented problem areas with essential features to create both visibility and product value communication.

# 

Repeated use of keywords should be avoided in title content because it leads to clumsy and unappealing texts. 

# 

The addition of excessive repeated words like “best vacuum cleaner” and “powerful vacuum cleaner” within the title does not enhance search rankings since it generates confusion in both readability and comprehension. Place vital keywords and product characteristics into the text in a natural way. 

# 

# Engaging and Emphasizing the Bullet Points for Optimization

# 

The Bullet Points – This section of an Amazon listing is an opportunity to get in the features and benefits of a product, so this is an area to focus strongly on optimization.

# 

 Not only is this a crucial aspect of Amazon’s ranking algorithm, but the bullet points are also directly visible to customers, so they must be keyword-optimized as well as persuasive.

# 

When forming bullet points a good practice is to optimize them one by one concentrating from the beginning on the points that initially come to the head of product selling. 

# 

Some of these can be size, color, durability, material, end use, etc. For instance, selling a waterproof backpack, bullet points should immediately communicate what makes that product special:

# 

* Waterproof – Completely waterproof with sealed zippers to keep your things safe in any climate
*  
* It holds a 15” laptop and has lots of compartments to keep you organized.
*  
* Durable Materials – Constructed from heavy-duty, abrasion-resistant fabric for durability.

# 

You can also include relevant keywords in the bullet points that help the algorithm understand what the product is and match it to customer searches.

# 

* The keywords “waterproof design” and “heavy-duty fabric,” for example, might be associated with high-intent searches such as “waterproof backpack for hiking.”

# 

# Improve Your Product Descriptions with Long-Tail Keywords

# 

As a result, Amazon’s search algorithm is skewed heavily towards long-tail keywords, with more specific customer intent.

# 

* And while broad keywords like “coffee maker” might generate general traffic, long-tail keywords like “best coffee maker for small kitchens” or “easy-to-use single-serve coffee maker” can help sellers bring in more qualified traffic and increase conversions.

# 

Long-tail keywords are usually less competitive which makes it a better chance for new or niche products to appear on top of the search results. Sellers can now target more niche searches with many relevant long-tail phrases scattered throughout their product description and not compete with larger, more established listings.

# 

* A **Amazon FBA** seller selling a smart thermostat, though, can use long-tail keywords such as “energy-efficient smart thermostat for large homes,” “Wi-Fi capable smart thermostat for Alexa” and “programmable thermostat with voice control.” 

# 

These phrases appeal to different kinds of customers, whether they want energy-saving features, compatibility with smart devices or straightforward programming. But do make sure not to go overboard with stuffing [Amazon keywords](https://amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-to-master-amazon-keywords/). 

# 

# Get More Customer Reviews and Keep Ratings High

# 

Customer reviews are one of Amazon’s most important ranking algorithm factors. The more positive reviews a product has, the higher it is likely to rank in search results, as positive reviews are indicators of trust and quality.

# 

 Vendors need to keep gathering more reviews while maintaining high ratings in order to improve the ranking.

# 

* Fortunately there are a number of techniques that will help you request reviews without running afoul of Amazon’s rules. One way to go is to utilize Amazon’s Request a Review button, which sends customers a standardized email asking for feedback on their order.

# 

 Sellers can also request a review in their follow-up emails in a friendly way. For example, once a product has been delivered, you might say something as simple as:

# 

* “We Hope you’re enjoying your new product! We appreciate reviews to help us improve and serve better.”

# 

That would be Amazon Vine, where trusted reviewers can obtain free products in exchange for honest reviews – just another method to garner some reviews. Positive reviews enhance the reputation of the product, which not only raises rankings but also builds trust in potential customers.

# 

Keeping high ratings is also essential. If you have a negative review, do something about it and try to resolve your customer’s problem. Handling negative feedback professionally demonstrates to potential buyers that the seller is considerate regarding consumer complaints, improving both reviews and conversion rates.

# 

# Optimize For Mobile Search And Voice Search

# 

Mobile is where the brand is: Over 60% of Amazon shoppers shop and buy on mobile. Optimizing for mobile search correlates to increased visibility and conversion, making this one of the most important aspects of optimizing listings. 

# 

MOBILE FRIENDLY: Listings must render quickly and use crisp, high resolution listing images with short bullet points and descriptions.

# 

Ease of navigation and readability are key here, especially for mobile users, as they are frequently on the road. This includes making bullet points scannable and making sure that the most compelling features (and evidence) are front loaded. 

# 

Most mobile users want fast access to information, so don’t use extended paragraphs that could overwhelm or confuse potential buyers.

# 

* Amazon’s Alexa is also popularizing another major trending topic: voice search. With the increasing usage of voice commands for customers to search products, it becomes crucial to optimize for voice search. Voice queries are often more conversational, so you’d want to focus on natural language. 

# 

However, instead of targeting “blender”, a voice search keyword might be “What is the best blender for smoothies?”

# 

For voicing search optimization, encompass vocals that are: nearest for how persons speak. This strategy increases visibility in voice-activated queries, so you want your product to show up when someone asks Alexa for recommendations.

# 

# Improve Click-Through Rates (CTR) with Compelling Images and Pricing Strategies

# 

Click-through rate (CTR) is an important factor in the Amazon ranking algorithm. Search algorithms favor items with a high click-through rates (CTR). Sellers must improve the [Amazon CTR](https://amzonestep.com/blog/what-factors-are-influencing-your-amazon-ctr/) by working out high-quality listing images and attractive pricing ways.

# 

An image is the first aspect your customer gets to see while scrolling through a search result. Engagement for a listing with high-resolution listing images showing the product from different angles are much higher. 

# 

* For instance, if selling a coffee maker, include photos of the product in action, close-ups of its most important features, and lifestyle shots that help customers visualize the item in their own kitchens.

# 

Another key consideration is price. If you can make the price and/or offer (bundling products for a discount, etc.) more competitive, this will help improve CTR rates by encouraging potential buyers to click on your listing.

# 

* Promotions, such as limited-time discounts, can also be used by **Amazon FBA** sellers to create an urgency among customers. For instance, “Save 20% for a limited time” can stimulate visitors to click to buy. If you stay on top of competitor prices, you can regularly adjust your price based on this.

# 

This means one can send a positive signal to Amazon’s algorithm to rank their product higher for better visibility to drive sales.

# 

# Keep Track of Performance and Adjust to Algorithm Changes

# 

Amazon algorithm like A9 and A10 is constantly evolving so sellers must stay updated with changes. Sellers need to adapt their strategies when search ranking factors change, so regularly monitoring performance allows them to do just that.

# 

There are multiple tools to measure listing performance, such as Amazon Seller Central, Brand Analytics, and third-party tools.

# 

They help sellers measure keyword ranks, conversion rates, and overall listing health. You can analyze keywords and check if there is any product feature or feature that is still unable to bring on traffic.

# 

# Try Buy One, Get One (BOGO) Promotions for Amazon Listings

# 

One of the simple yet powerful approaches when it comes to promotion is a Buy One Get One (BOGO) promotion that works well to increase Amazon sales and drive customer actions. 

# 

This is a super great offer for both a typical first time buyer and every repeat customer, where one is getting some free offer on a purchase if the product qualifies the offer.

# 

 If done correctly, BOGO promotions can help you gain better product exposure, acquire a higher customer base to purchase your product and help you attain greater sales — an indispensable weapon for the Amazon seller.

# 

# The Effectiveness of BOGO Promotions on Amazon

# 

Deals are in an Amazon shopper’s DNA, and while BOGO makes sense functionally, it also plays into the instinct to make a beeline for the deal that provides immediate value. 

# 

The idea of getting something extra for free or at a discount and completing the purchase resonates well with shoppers. That sense of extra value often leads clients to make larger purchases than they originally intended.

# 

The competition on Amazon is fierce and if you can add a BOGO that might set your product apart from the competition. This is a deadline-oriented way of selling that can increase the conversion of visitors to buyers. 

# 

Buy One, Get One Free — This model appeals especially to the compatible consumer, who wants to get the most out of the checkout process. 

# 

* For example, if a shopper was only planning on buying one product, but sees that they can receive a second, free of charge, they are more likely to make the purchase.

# 

Additionally, BOGO offers can increase Average Order Value (AOV) and encourage repeat purchases. And if shoppers are able to find the exact item they were looking for, they may even feel more fulfilled by their purchase, leading to positive [product reviews](https://amzonestep.com/blog/7-ways-to-provide-product-reviews-on-amazon/), and greater customer retention.

# 

# How to Set Up a BOGO Promotion on Amazon

Setting up a BOGO on Amazon is a simple and straightforward process via Amazon Seller Central. So, here is a guideline about how to go-about implementing it.

* Log into Seller Central, Click on Promotions Tab:
* Navigate to the Advertising tab in Seller Central
* From the drop-down choose promotions and click on create new promotion.

Let’s face it. If you run a business in Gurgaon, you spend half your life complaining about two things: the rent and the traffic.

For years, we’ve been told that if you aren't in Cyber City or on Golf Course Road, you don't exist. But have you tried driving there at 9 AM lately? It’s a battle. And frankly, paying a fortune for a tiny office where your clients can’t even find parking just doesn't make sense anymore.

This is exactly why smart money is moving to **New Gurgaon**. And right at the heart of this shift is **Sector 84**.

https://preview.redd.it/8naul30om2ig1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=410cc07def9f7fe286e3e288f3872cb68df19fe5

If you are scouting for[ **Office Space in Sector 84 Gurgaon**](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/properties/office-space-in-sector-84-gurgaon), you aren't downgrading; you are ""right-sizing."" You are getting Grade-A infrastructure without the Grade-A headache.

# The Connectivity Cheat Code

The biggest myth about New Gurgaon is that it’s ""far."" Maybe five years ago, sure. But today? Sector 84 sits in a strategic sweet spot. You are practically hugging the **Dwarka Expressway**.

* **For Delhi Commuters:** The drive from Dwarka is now a breeze compared to the NH-48 crawl.
* **For the Local Team:** You are connected to Manesar’s industrial hub and the residential belts of Sectors 81-90. This means your employees can actually afford to live near the office. A 10-minute commute instead of an hour-long slog? That is a hiring perk no amount of free coffee can beat.

# The ""Elan Miracle"" Factor

One of the main reasons this sector is popping off is the quality of commercial developments coming up. You aren't stuck in a standalone building with zero amenities.

Take [**Elan Miracle sector 84 Gurgaon**](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/property-details/elan-miracle), for example. It’s hard to ignore this project when you drive by. It’s massive, it’s modern, and it changes the vibe of the whole area. Having your office in or near a landmark like **Elan Miracle sector 84 Gurgaon** means you have an ecosystem. You have a luxury high-street retail experience, a cinema (PVR), and a massive food court right downstairs.

Think about your client meetings. Instead of offering them a dusty chair and instant coffee, you can take them down to a premium café or host a proper business lunch without leaving the building. It makes your small business look big and your big business look established.

# A Neighborhood That’s Already Alive

The problem with some new sectors is the ""ghost town"" feel. Sector 84 doesn’t have that problem. You are surrounded by fully occupied residential societies like *Gurgaon One* and *Vatika INXT*. This means the area is safe, active, and buzzing 24/7. If you are a service-based business (like a consultancy, clinic, or design studio), your customers are literally your neighbors. You don’t have to fight for visibility; you are already in the middle of their community.

# The Verdict: Why Wait?

The rental rates for **Office Space in Sector 84 Gurgaon** are still in the ""affordable"" bracket, but they won't stay there forever. As the Dwarka Expressway becomes fully operational and more brands move in, the prices will climb.

1qyd8rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1qyd8rs/do_you_relate_to_some_of_these_things/,Do you relate to some of these things?,"So full disclaimer I'm a med student in the UK about to graduate. I've run supervised GP clinics where we've seen countless ppl requesting ADHD referrals so I understand the waiting lists and difficulty getting through to psych for actual management.

I don't plan to stay in the UK after around 2 years so I'm not really planning to get on a waiting list for potential medication. I've thought about going for a private assessment, just for some confirmation/validation of what I think but waiting till I graduate atleast and have a bit more money.

So I just wanted to ask if you guys relate to any of these maybe less common things in the meantime:

* **Only feeling better once you start a Task** (i.e: feeling like the world is burning and you're drowning in everything when you have something to do that you're not doing, take assingments for an example, feeling like your life is deteriorating, getting very little sleep, room looking like a bomb site, gaining alot of weight, falling behind on grooming laundry everything really - but then once you finally force yourself into the task everything starts making sense again and you get structure back)
* **Feeling like you absolutely cannot Stop a Task in the ""Middle"" of it** (Like you can for instance have weeks where you don't do much and you're fine with it. But if you start something, get overwhelmed and need a break in the middle of it, without finishing the task or doing it to the ability/pace you can do if you force yourself, you can't live with yourself. Like your self-esteem plummets, things spread from I can't do this assignment to I can't shower. Even when you have a meta moment and realise okay I still have time with this deadline I can slow down for some days, knowing you're not doing things with this task makes you stop doing basic self care, grooming, maintenance with yourself and it only reverses when you get back on with the task)
* **Feeling Weaker and More Pain with Time** (Feeling lots of sleepless nights, overeating, not drinking water, being irresponsible with money, burning your wrist on your old laptop's keyboard just kinda stacking up as you get older with stomach pains, headaches , bad finances and some carpal tunnel probably)
* **Feeling like Your Family/Friends can see when you're deteriorating** (When you meet them again looking in worse shape, more disheveled, sleep deprived etc, feeling like not only can they see how much you're deteriorating but also feeling like they're really disappointed in you and sometimes thinking that they feel like you're slipping back into your old ways and they can't rely on you)
* **Watching other Friends with Fear and sometimes Pride about yourself in Comparison** (Seeing friends who may be struggling or going through a phase of maybe drinking more, smoking more, struggling with work and thinking that you're not far from that place either. It's gonna sound horrible but almost thinking life is this big game and right now your friends are in a lower place but that could also be you and you just gotta grip on and weather each day as overnight or within a couple days that could also be you)
* **Wanting to be Part of Society** (Wanting to study/get on with work and assignments and just talk about them like any person does, like talking about your routine as a normal expected one rather than the real mix it is of bursts, depression and ideation. Like telling people oh I just go to i just go to the gym each evening or I just play football each saturday, when in reality its I play football maybe 2/4 saturdays every month and sometimes i cry on the way there because i thought my life was all over the night before and sometimes i cry when i get home because once i get out of the shower i do nothing productive with my time and it makes my self-esteem plummet)
* **Ignoring everything you've gone through once things 'Go Back to Normal'** (Rationalising everything, all the sweating at night, sometimes hallucinations, ideation, weight gain, just telling yourself everyone goes through this and we're all just better/worse at hiding it, or telling yourself this is just the game you have to play in life and really things are much more harder than they look or even just telling yourself you'll figure out what is going on later once you finish this deadline but never really figuring it out)
* **Being Scared of Having Nothing to Do** (Looking at a train journey, a weekened, a friday night alone and being scared at the idea of having nothing at all to get on with. Sometimes even doing certain tasks slower just so your mind is on something and you don't have to sit alone with your thoughts and feel yourself slip into darkness. Always bringing your laptop so you can get on with something, even when you're just meeting a friend for a coffee, if you get there early pulling the laptop out to do things until they arrive)
* Edit (Point to add) **Relief with Distractions** (Sometimes getting a hit of relief when you play that movie, play one specific song, come out the shower, play a certain videogame, it doesnt work always but sometimes it can feel a temporary decompress for you brain and you're just able to relax for once)

These are just some things but like I said I've never been assessed for ADHD so I couldn't say if I could have it or something else could be going on. Just wanted to ask if any of you relate to these and:

a). Does it help your mind to rationalise it as part of ADHD?

b). How do you deal with the instability all this brings?",1,1770469348.0,ADHDUK,3,0.67,False

Lover of long, rambling chats about life, feelings, and random 2am thoughts

Big on music, movies, and binge-watching shows (recommend me something and I’m already interested)

Enjoy cooking (and eating… equally important), chai/coffee breaks, and experimenting with recipes

Into walking, light workouts/yoga, and pretending I’m very disciplined

I read, journal, overthink, and enjoy meaningful connections

Dry humor, playful sarcasm, and a little harmless charm included ✨

I’m looking for people who enjoy conversation, can laugh at themselves, and understand that friendship can be warm, fun, and slightly cheeky without crossing lines. If you can hold a conversation and don’t disappear after “hey,” we’ll probably get along.

Age, gender, location don’t matter—just be kind, respectful, and actually interested in making a friend.

My 48 hr experience with audio-only frames,"I know smart glasses aren't traditional BIFL, nothing with a lithium battery ever will be. But if we're using tech anyway, which designs actually resist planned obsolescence? Worth discussing imo.

Been trying to find smart glasses that don't give me a massive headache after an hour. I tried the Ray-Ban Metas for abit but honestly the battery was just annoying and they felt a little heavy on my nose bridge after a full work day. I skipped Amazon Echo Frames (felt flimsy), and XREAL (bulky + tethering cable = neck strain).

Went testing with an audio-only pair. My theory: fewer components = longer lifespan and better chance at being actual BIFL quality.

The 48h challenge (no charging):

I did a full weekend test, errands, work calls, office time, just to see if they'd actually last. There 35g which is basically the same as my regular glasses.

What worked:

Actually light. Wore them for 10 hours straight at the office and forgot they were tech. No red marks on my nose which is usually my dealbreaker with wearables.

The battery claim is legit. 48 hours without charging. I think because they dont have a camera or huge display sucking power they just keep going. Less charging cycles = slower battery degradation over time.

Note taking. The AI summary thing turned a 45min rambling meeting into 5 bullet points. Genuinley useful for productivity.

The tradeoffs:

Audio is optimized for calls and podcasts not music. Dont expect high-end headphone quality. But for glasses its pretty solid.

AI transcription struggled abit with my coworkers thick accent. Had to fix a few words manually.

In really loud environments (coffee shops with music blasting, busy streets) the open-ear audio means you miss some details. Not a dealbreaker but worth mentioning.

Early durability signs:

           • Hinges feel solid, no creaking after constant use

          • Frame flex is minimal despite being lightweight

          • No heating issues during long calls

          • Simple construction (no    camera modules to break)

Basically if you want something for productivity that could potentially last years instead of becoming e-waste, audio-only seems like the smarter bet. The big brands are cramming in cameras and displays thatll be outdated in 2 years anyway.

When The Rain Stops: Was really excited to try this one since i have been looking for an after rain type of fragnance. It's pretty decent, to me it feels like an earthly note was added to Lazy Sunday Morning. Has a clean soapy opening which slowly transforms into a calm earthy fresh fragnance.

Under The Stars: This is what made me order this month's decant, have rarely heard about Under The Stars when it comes to maison margeila. It's has a sweet powdery sort of opening and maybe little bit of woody. later it feels more eathy than powdery. i think layering this and When The Rain Stops will give that perfect after rain combination. Also reminds me of Zara Fields At nightfall.

Coffee Break: I tried just 2 spray for testing the decant. Has a sweet coffee smell. A proper Cafe Vibes which has woody interior and coffee beans freshly roasted in their open kitchen.

Drakker Noir: This was solely for nostalgic reasons. As everyone calls it The Godfather of Barbershop Fragnances, Masculine Fragnance from the 80s. It was my first actual perfume that i ""borrowed"" from my dad's wardrobe. Will probably get the whole bottle for noir and intense by Drakkar. (any partial sellers can DM, might buy them next month)

Bvlgari Man In Black: A friend was wearing this and i got to know about it from him. Really liked it but didn't really try so can't say much about it.

I encourage all of you to ask more stupid questions and make more jokes, because it certainly helped me out.

I’m 30F (27, at the time of this incident) and had been painting and sketching for many years. One of my major life goals was to be featured in an art gallery and be able to go to the event and talk about my work. I love visiting galleries, not just to envision my desire, but to also see what talent is out there.

In the coastal town I used to live in, there was a gallery that was owned by a fairly accomplished artist. At the time, he had pieces in Paris, Tokyo, Ontario, you name it, but his home town was about thirty minutes outside of mine. I showed up to the gallery and started to peek around.

As I was looking, I met some staff who told me about a gallery event coming up soon to honor talent from the surrounding area that this said artist would be overseeing. I jokingly asked, in the most sarcastic and light hearted tone, “Ha, could I join?”.

Next thing I know, I’m getting serious questions about my work. How long have I been creating? What were my mediums? The kind of stuff that makes me realize I opened up a flood gate I wasn’t ready for. I could feel myself sweating. I fumbled through every question as best I could. Next thing I know, I’m searching through pieces on my phone, am told I have “good color composition”, and am being asked if I could have one to four pieces prepared by next week (a task I felt by no means ready to tackle, but felt obligated to agree because who else gets offered this)?

Cue a four day long sobbing episode of barely any sleep, lots of coffee, and shaking as I throw two pieces together. All the while my twin is texting me trying to keep me calm, knowing what a massive thing this is for me. Still teases me to this day that I “speed ran a major life goal”.

The event was great. There were art professors from nearby colleges, wine tastings, several different artists like myself, and a live performance artist dancing on some suspended metal contraption that looked way too complicated for me. I was asked questions I didn’t even know how to answer about my own work and stumbled through them like a two year old. I did, very briefly, get to meet the artist and gallery owner- He was delightfully down to earth and incredibly sweet. And of course, there were also people who took themselves way too seriously and walked around with berets.

If you’ve ever walked into a room and forgotten why you’re there, welcome to the club. If that’s happening five times a day and your concentration's shot — we need to talk.

Brain fog can make you feel slow, unfocused, and frustrated. It affects your work, your sleep, and your ability to remember why you opened the fridge in the first place.

Some say it’s **stress**, others blame **poor sleep**. But what if it’s deeper than that? Could the real culprit be **microbial toxins** and **heavy metals affecting memory**?

Let’s talk about [Fast Brain Booster](https://theworldhealth.org/fast-brain-booster-official), a supplement that’s stirring up curiosity for claiming to clean out your brain — like a spring-cleaning for your thoughts.

# 📦 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Fast Brain Booster
* **Category**: Wellness ➝ Brain Health Supplements
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.7/5

============

>

============

# 🧬 What Is Fast Brain Booster?

**Fast Brain Booster** is a **natural brain detox supplement** formulated to reduce fog, improve memory, and restore focus. But here’s where it gets interesting.

Unlike other pills that flood your system with caffeine, this one works by flushing out **toxins** — especially **heavy metals in the brain** causing **symptoms** like confusion and forgetfulness.

The makers believe **memory loss caused by brain toxins** is a major issue and that addressing **early signs of brain toxin overload** is the first step to mental clarity.

It’s made for people who feel mentally “off” and want a fix without stimulants or chemicals — just clean support from **plant-based brain supplements**.

# 🧠 How Does It Work?

The idea behind **Fast Brain Booster** is pretty simple. It targets **toxic brain buildup** by encouraging your body to **remove brain toxins naturally**.

By doing that, it claims to free up your brain’s “bandwidth” — improving memory, mood, and processing speed. No system overload, no jitters.

The key is balance. Instead of masking symptoms, it helps **cleanse your brain for better focus** and sharper thinking using **natural remedies for brain fog**.

For those wondering **how to flush heavy metals from the brain**, this might be the option worth trying before you resort to internet rabbit holes and conspiracy blogs.

# 🌿 Key Ingredients and Their Roles

The **Fast Brain Booster ingredients list** includes [14 natural compounds](https://theworldhealth.org/fast-brain-booster-official), all chosen for their brain-supporting effects and detox abilities.

* **Ginkgo Biloba Leaf**: Used to support blood flow and help combat **symptoms of toxic brain buildup**.
* **Bacopa Monnieri**: One of the oldest **herbs that help with mental focus** and stress adaptation.
* **Alpha-GPC**: Provides choline for memory, ideal for those seeking **natural ways to restore mental clarity**.
* **Huperzine A**: Preserves key neurotransmitters for better focus and short-term recall.
* **St. John’s Wort**: Often used in **natural remedies for brain fog**, especially where mood is involved.
* **Lecithin**: Delivers phospholipids to protect brain cells from damage.

Each of these contributes to improving **mental clarity**, especially in people looking for **how to improve brain clarity naturally** without synthetic formulas.

# 🧪 Real Experience With Fast Brain Booster (via Leo, my sister’s old college friend)

Leo’s a middle school history teacher who’s been in the game for over a decade.

We caught up at a dinner party my sister hosted — the kind where you end up talking about everything from ancient Mesopotamia to meal prepping.

Leo casually mentioned how hard it’s been keeping up with lesson planning and grading papers lately. “I used to memorize student names in a day,” he said. “Now I blank on my own login sometimes.”

He’d been trying to power through the fog with coffee and sheer willpower, but neither was cutting it.

A mutual friend had told him about [Fast Brain Booster](https://theworldhealth.org/fast-brain-booster-official), and after some initial skepticism (and reading too many **brain detox supplement reviews** at 1 a.m.), he gave it a shot.

Leo told me the shift was gradual, not dramatic. Around week three, he said things started clicking again — fewer mid-sentence pauses, less re-reading, and more fluid recall during lectures.

What impressed him most was how it didn’t come with a jittery edge like some **supplements that flush out brain toxins**.

The only downside? The capsules smell like a dried salad. But as he put it, “If that’s the tax for feeling like myself again, I’ll pay it.”

Was thinking of walking to sakayan I walked a couple meters away from the CS, pero I stopped bcs madilim so I waited nalang. Then I saw this guy approaching with a bolo knife on his hand pero may lagayan. When he past by me, the chills is so different like it's for real nerve wracking. Nang lumalayo na siya lingon ng lingon sakin, few meters away from me mubalik siya. So I ran na (assumera na kung assumera) gusto ko pumasok ulit sa cs pero idk my feet won't stop running. He wasn't running but his walking pace is faster than before. Like tumatakbo na ako pero parang ang lapit nya na agad. Then may nakita akong motor pinara ko na agad. 

Pagka sakay ko, I calmed myself nung nakasakay nako pero sinusundan ko parin siya ng tingin humina na din yung walking pace niya. We had eye contact, nanginig ako ng sobra. 

6:58 pilit kong kinakalma yung sarili ko. Shared it to a ""friend"" from reddit (we were chatting while I was waiting na makasakay). I didn't need advice, didn't need help, just wanted to share bcs I feel like my heart will burst talaga sa nerbyos. Then he replied, move on na atleast walang nangyari sayo. I snapped. I cursed at him, he then added I was being passive and should stop relive the thought. Deleted the whole convo pati sa kanya (tg), he asked why I deleted it, blocked him agad. 

Passive pa ba yung tumakbo na ako agad seeing the guy na pabalik? Wtf talaga. Until now, I'm still shaking.

1qycwxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1qycwxw/how_to_hack_time_perception_to_work_longer/,How to Hack Time Perception to Work Longer WITHOUT Hating It (Science-Backed),"I used to think productive people had some superhuman ability to grind for 12 hours straight. Turns out, they're not working harder, they're literally experiencing time differently. After diving into neuroscience research, psychology podcasts, and experimenting on myself, I realized our perception of time is way more flexible than we think. The wild part? You can manipulate it.



Most of us feel like work drags on forever while fun stuff flies by. That's not random. Your brain processes time based on how much new information it's absorbing and how engaged you are. The more monotonous the task, the slower time moves. But here's the kicker, you can reverse this effect by working WITH your brain's natural time perception instead of against it.



**\*\*1. Use the ""novelty effect"" to compress time\*\***

Your brain measures time by creating memories. More distinct memories equals perception of more time passing. Boring, repetitive work creates fewer memories, so paradoxically it feels longer in the moment but shorter in retrospect.

The hack is to introduce micro novelties every 25-30 minutes. Change your location, switch the type of task, adjust your position (standing vs sitting), or even change the background music. Your brain gets enough stimulation to stay engaged, but not so much that you're distracted.



Research from neuroscientist David Eagleman shows our brains are constantly recalibrating time perception based on environmental changes. When you're bored, your prefrontal cortex basically starts counting seconds. When you're engaged, it stops micromanaging and time ""speeds up.""



I started applying this during deep work sessions and holy shit, 3 hours felt like 45 minutes. The work didn't get easier, but the psychological drag disappeared.



**\*\*2. Manipulate your dopamine levels strategically\*\***



Dopamine doesn't just make you feel good, it actually speeds up your internal clock. Low dopamine makes time drag. High dopamine makes it fly. This is why waiting rooms feel eternal but parties end too fast.

Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) talks about this extensively on his podcast. He recommends ""dopamine stacking"" where you pair slightly boring tasks with small rewards. Not huge ones that'll wreck your baseline, just enough to keep your dopamine steady.



Practical example: I drink my favorite coffee ONLY during morning admin work. My brain now associates spreadsheets with that dopamine hit, and suddenly emails don't feel like torture. Pair your least favorite tasks with small pleasures, music you love, a specific snack, natural light, whatever works.

Also, avoid massive dopamine spikes (doomscrolling, porn, junk food binges) because they crash your baseline and make normal work feel impossibly slow afterward.



**\*\*3. Use ""time landmarks"" to create psychological breaks\*\***



This comes from research on temporal landmarks. Your brain treats certain moments (Monday morning, first of the month, post lunch) as mental reset points. You can manufacture these to make long work sessions feel segmented instead of endless.

Instead of thinking ""I have 6 hours of work ahead,"" break it into distinct chapters with clear endpoints. 9-11am is research mode. 11-12:30 is writing mode. 1:30-3 is editing mode. Each segment feels like its own contained experience rather than one massive slog.



If you want to go deeper on productivity psychology and neuroscience but don't have hours to read every book, check out [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's an AI-powered personalized learning app from a team of Columbia alumni and former Google experts. 



You can tell it something super specific like ""I want to hack my time perception and build better focus as someone who gets easily distracted,"" and it'll pull from books, research papers, and expert insights to create a custom learning plan and audio podcast just for you. You control the depth too, quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus the voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes productivity content way less dry. Worth trying if you're serious about optimizing how your brain works.



**\*\*4. Leverage ""flow state"" triggers\*\***



Flow state is that magical zone where hours vanish and you're completely absorbed. It's not mystical, it's neuroscience. Flow happens when task difficulty matches your skill level almost perfectly, slightly challenging but achievable.

Most people never hit flow because they're either doing tasks way too easy (boredom, time drags) or way too hard (anxiety, time also drags). The sweet spot is about 4% above your current ability.



Also, eliminate ALL notifications. Flow requires about 15 minutes of uninterrupted focus to kick in. One ping resets that timer. I use an app called[ Freedom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freedom-screen-time-control/id1269788228) to block everything during deep work blocks. Costs money but legitimately worth it for the focus gains.

Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" is the bible for this. Won a bunch of productivity awards and Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who practices what he preaches. The book will make you question everything about modern work culture and how we've completely destroyed our ability to focus. Insanely good read.



**\*\*5. Reframe your relationship with effort\*\***



This is more psychological but equally important. If you see work as suffering, your brain will make time crawl to protect you. If you see it as skill building or meaningful progress, time perception shifts dramatically.

Researcher Kelly McGonigal has amazing work on this. Her book ""The Upside of Stress"" shows how reframing stress as helpful (increased focus, energy mobilization) actually changes your physiological response AND time perception. When you stop resisting the discomfort and accept it as part of growth, hours become way more tolerable.



I started viewing focused work as training my attention span like a muscle. Sounds cheesy but it genuinely helped. Instead of ""ugh 4 more hours,"" it became ""cool, 4 hours to level up my concentration ability.""



**\*\*6. Use music strategically, not randomly\*\***



Music affects time perception MASSIVELY but most people use it wrong. Lyrical music splits your attention. Silence can make time drag if you're doing boring tasks. The move is ambient music or brown noise matched to your task intensity.

For deep analytical work, try brown noise or classical (I use the [Focus@Will](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-will-control-your-add/id638810714) app, it's literally designed around neuroscience research for attention). For creative work, slightly upbeat instrumental. For monotonous tasks, more energetic music to compensate for the dopamine drop.



There's solid research showing music with 50-80 BPM can enhance focus and alter time perception. It matches your resting heart rate so your brain doesn't fight it.



Look, none of this is about becoming a work robot. It's about understanding that your brain isn't trying to sabotage you, it's just responding to inputs. When you learn how time perception actually works, you can design your days around it instead of constantly fighting your own biology. That shift alone makes work way less miserable, and weirdly enough, time starts cooperating.",2,1770468391.0,MindfullyDriven,2,1.0,False

*\*crossposting this from* r/singapore *as original post has been deleted by the mods*

Yes, based on the [H1 2025 stats: speeding violations up 45.5%](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/injuries-deaths-on-singapores-roads-rise-in-h1-2025-accidents-due-to-red-light-violation-also-up). Elderly pedestrian deaths up 150%. But numbers are just numbers. The reality on the ground is a blatant culture of ego and entitlement. If nothing is done, 2026 will be a repeat or worse than 2025.

I’m a parent, and doing the school run every morning feels like navigating a war zone. I see drivers speeding in school zones, on roads leading to schools, weaving through traffic to save 5 seconds, and behaving as if their destination is more important than human life.

**The current laws are a joke.**

Fines are just ""coffee money"" for these drivers. Demerit points are a slap on the wrist.

Look at the recent tragedies:

The [Chinatown case today](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/girl-6-dies-after-accident-in-chinatown-near-buddha-tooth-relic-temple) where a 6-year-old was killed, and the driver was seen arguing with the father instead of helping.

The [Dunearn Road horror](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-drink-driver-who-drove-with-his-2-children-in-car-and-killed-a-pedestrian) where a drunk driver with his own kids in the car severed a pedestrian's body and tried to move it.

These drivers clearly don't care. Why? Because there is no **immediate disruption** to their lives. They don't fear the law.

**We need to collectively take action and let our MP know our concerns.**

If the government can have a zero-tolerance, harsh stance on drugs, why is ""reckless driving causing death"" treated so lightly?

I have drafted a template below. Please, take 5 minutes to send this to your MP. You can find your MP's email [here](https://www.parliament.gov.sg/mps/list-of-current-mps). Note : i'm not astroturfing but i asking for citizens to voice their concerns. MPs will usually forward all these concerns to either LTA/TP. If more are raised, we can get more attention on this and make the roads being safe as a priority.

We need to demand:

**Immediate Vehicle Confiscation** for egregious speeding/recklessness.

**Jail and caning, not just fines**, for dangerous driving.

**Review of the Law** to equate reckless killing with Culpable Homicide.

Note : you can use the template or use this as a reference for your email to your MP.

**Template to copy-paste below:**

**Subject:** URGENT: Constituent Feedback on Rising Road Danger & Request for Harsher Enforcement

**Dear \[MP's Name\],**

I am a resident of \[Constituency Name\]. I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the deteriorating safety on our roads.

With the recent H1 2025 statistics showing a 45% increase in speeding and a sharp rise in fatalities, it is clear that the current approach of ""education and monitoring"" is failing. On the ground, we are seeing a culture of aggressive, ego-driven driving where traffic laws are ignored because the penalties are seen as mere inconveniences.

Recent tragic cases, such as the fatality of the 6-year-old girl in Chinatown, highlight that many drivers simply do not fear the consequences of their actions.

As your constituent, I am asking you to raise this issue in Parliament. We need a shift toward **""Disruption as Deterrence.""** I support:

1. **Harsher Penalties:** Reclassifying reckless driving causing death to carry heavier jail terms, similar to Culpable Homicide.
2. **Immediate Confiscation:** Empowering Traffic Police to impound vehicles immediately for egregious speeding and reckless acts.
3. **Stricter Enforcement:** Implementing ""Shenzhen-style"" ubiquitous camera enforcement to ensure a near-100% catch rate.

Please help us make our roads safe again before more innocent lives are lost.

**Sincerely,**

What issues are you dealing with at home right now? I have two I’ll highlight. One a very real concern, the other is making me irrationally angry. 

Real concern first is my son, who has court again in a couple of weeks hasn’t been participating with his school program, sleeps all day, sometimes all night too. He had his best friend come over and basically begged my son to go out with friends for a couple of hours last night (a Friday night). My son refused, I also tried to encourage him to get out of the house, nope. He went to bed again. So I don’t know if this is a medication management thing or, more likely his depression really taking hold. I plan to reach out to his therapist on Monday. The court may take him from the home and I think it’s really starting to hit him. Hitting me too.

The irrational anger. I have a very nice Sony TV with a great home audio set up in my basement. I noticed several months ago the audio system wasn’t working, and finally discovered the audio cable connecting the TV to the system had been removed. I found and bought a replacement and the audio worked! I came downstairs, very early, this morning, with coffee in hand planning to watch a movie before the world woke up, only to discover the new cable I had very recently bought had also been taken. WTH, why? So now I can’t have the stupid home movie experience I had been looking forward to. It’s trivial, I know, by why the heck does he keep taking the cord? I plan to talk with him when he wakes up (it’s 6:30 am as I’m writing this), but anticipate a answer will be something along the lines of “I don’t know/I don’t remember”. Living with a person with a TBI and mental/behavioral health issues can be so challenging. Ok, breathe. Phew.

I’m asking for (A) what needs advance booking, (B) area-clustered ‘must-dos’ for Tokyo/Kyoto, (C) vegan/no-egg food recs near my bases, (D) sumo + Sanja parade viewing tips.

* “Which Tokyo/Kyoto experiences need booking weeks/months ahead?”
* “Best neighborhood clusters for Tokyo (Asakusa base) and Kyoto (Kyoto Station base)?”
* “Most reliable vegan/no-egg options (restaurants + konbini items) in each city?”
* “Best way to do sumo + best place/time for Sanja Matsuri parade on May 15?”

Hi everyone! I’m planning my first solo trip to Japan in May 2026 and I’d love advice mainly on what to do in each city, ideally grouped by area/neighborhood, plus anything that needs tickets booked ahead of time.

Bases + dates (hotels already booked)

* Tokyo: May 10–15 (6 days): staying in Asakusa
* Fuji Five Lakes (Kawaguchiko): May 16–17 (2 days)
* Kyoto: May 18–23 (6 days): staying near Kyoto Station
* Using Kyoto as a base for Osaka (easy evening) and Hiroshima (one full day)

# 1) Tokyo (Asakusa base) “what are the best things to do?”

I’m aiming for a **calm pace**: 2–3 anchors/day + walking neighborhoods.

**My interests:**

* Anime + gaming + tech culture
* Cool streets/markets, scenic walks, temples/shrines (in moderation)
* Thrill rides / roller coasters if feasible
* Cafe hopping, spending time in solace (such as reading a good book while I sip a good coffee)
* Anything “very Japan” that first-timers shouldn’t miss

**Specific asks:**

* I want to see a sumo event (tournament or any authentic sumo experience that’s worth it for a tourist).
   * What’s the best way to do this in May? Is it realistic during these dates?
   * If not a tournament, what alternative sumo-related experience is legit (stable morning practice / exhibitions / etc.)?
* May 15 parade (I believe it’s part of the Sanja Matsuri weekend around Asakusa).
   * Best viewing spots / best time to arrive / any etiquette tips?
* Anime/tech areas: I’m planning to explore Akihabara, but I’m also curious if there are anime/tech-ish things closer to Asakusa/Ueno that are worth doing.
* What are the Tokyo activities that require booking ahead (and how far in advance)? Examples: theme parks, observation decks, special museums, day trips, etc.

**If helpful, please suggest Tokyo in clusters like:**

* Asakusa / Ueno
* Akihabara
* Shibuya / Harajuku
* Shinjuku
* Odaiba / waterfront …and “what to do + what to book.”

# 2) Kawaguchiko / Fuji Five Lakes (2 days)

I’m going here for scenic views + a slower pace + riding a bicycle while I enjoy view of the magnificent Fuji.

**Asks:**

* Best viewpoints and lakeside walks (and which lake areas are most worth it)
* Is Fuji-Q Highland worth it for a solo visitor? (I’m into coasters.)
   * Any ticket strategy or timing tips?
* Anything I should book ahead here (buses, Fuji-Q, viewpoints, rentals)

# 3) Kyoto (Kyoto Station base) + day trips

I’ll use Kyoto as a home base and do day trips.

Kyoto asks:

* Best things to do clustered by area (so I don’t bounce across town all day)
* Any “must do” cultural experiences that are worth booking (tea ceremony, special tours, etc.)
* Best neighborhoods for evening walks / chill solo exploring

Osaka day trip (evening) asks:

* Best “one evening Osaka” plan (food streets + vibes + a few anchor spots)

Hiroshima day trip asks:

* A solid one-day plan: Peace Memorial area + museum + anything else you think is essential

# Food: vegetarian/vegan (NO egg)

I’m vegetarian and prefer vegan when possible.

Would love:

* Restaurant/café recs for Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kawaguchiko
* Quick/packed options (konbini/supermarket items that are reliably egg-free)
* Tips for ordering / common hidden ingredients (egg, fish stock, etc.)
* Anything worth booking in advance for Hiroshima

# Practical: solo + beginner Japanese + train anxiety

I’m a bit nervous about doing Japan solo and navigating big stations.

Any tips you wish you knew as a first-time solo traveler:

* Station navigation strategy / apps / “don’t get lost” rules
* Whether my inter-city transfer plan is sensible:
   * Tokyo → Kawaguchiko (highway bus from Shinjuku area)
   * Kawaguchiko → Kyoto (bus to Mishima + Shinkansen)
* Is luggage forwarding (takkyubin) easy from Tokyo to Kyoto?
* Transport Anxiety: I’ve heard the train system is confusing. As an anxious traveler who doesn't speak Japanese (learning basics on Duolingo), how hard is it to navigate the transfers between these cities?

# About Myself (so that it might help you give good recommendations)

I describe my lifestyle as ""FitNerd"". I’m disciplined about fitness (gym 6x/week), deep work, and learning. I’m shy and introverted and comfortable with solitude, but I’m pushing myself to try new experiences.

I never saw it coming. This was the first time in my life where I didn’t see it coming.

Everything was perfect between us. All of it.

I knew this girl for almost 5 years, through mutuals. Met her 5 years ago first in a mutual setting with friends. Never met her again after. We didn’t connect on social media either then. Life had happened, I was away from my friends 4 years after that.

The day I reconnected with my friends, there she is. At my bestfriend’s birthday celebration. She added me on instagram right after that night. We started interacting with eachother online, liking posts, stories. We both knew something was there. Met her again about 2 times with the same friends, friends were even trying to get us close. I knew something was there. But neither of us took the first step to talk.

Just us.

7 months later, we started talking. She texted me. Would’ve started talking her sooner if I wasn’t dumb enough to start dating a girl, worst decision I ever made.

Was single for almost a 1 year and a half after my divorce, then I decided to go for a girl who started talking to me, instead of the girl who I liked as well. Really bad decision, Went through a lot of bad shit with that girl. But life happens I guess. Taught me a lot.

After things ended with her, I started interacting with her again, she knew things ended with the girl I was dating, she started interacting with me too. And after sometime, she decided to finally text me. Yeaah, she made the first move.

But from there on, I knew I couldn’t mess this up. I knew for her to talk to me still, after knowing I started dating a girl while we were already having a small thing going on online, interacting with eachother. That she really actually liked me. She waited for me.. she wasn’t even seeing anyone during that time.

We started talking, hit it right off. I took her out on a date just a few days later, we had an amazing time. We started seeing eachother often, then almost every day. Our bond grew quickly, intimacy started off soon too.

This was the first time, in my life where I was in a healthy connection with someone.

This was the only time I felt like I could rest, I could breathe.

I spent my life guessing every move, being cautious. But this girl changed it all for me.

She showed me something that I never had in my life.

Genuine care, reciprocation, respect, she was the girl who truly showed me appreciation for everything I brought. And she showed me that every time without a single miss.

I was enjoying every moment with her. Not even a month, she introduced me to her family, was invited to birthdays, dinners. Gatherings, going playing sports with them. She even started introducing me to her closest friends, the most trusted ones she have. This all happened in about a month. She would invite me to come join coffees with them too. Her family loved me, her friends loved me. I’m a basketball coach for kids, they are a very important part of my life. Those kids, she even initiated seeing them and building a bond with them too. This meant a lot for me..

They all saw us perfect for eachother. She was so happy with how everything was going.

Deep down I was scared how fast it was going, but I was still so happy, someone proud to openly introduce and invite me into their world this way. I always wanted this.

She did all of this without having me to talk about it or even ask about it. It genuinely made me trust her and get even closer to her. I started introducing her to my closest friends, my family. Everything was going so well. She was loved by them too.

I showed her appreciation, and love by treating her the best way that I can. Affection, care, treated her like a queen. In everyway. She brought so much happiness and light into my life, I never expected i’d have this.

I wanted to give it all back to her just how she gave it to me.

I asked her to be my girlfriend in the 2nd month. She happily said yes to the relationship. Few weeks later, during new years holiday time. I usually go on a solo trip at the end of the year, this time I decided to stay back and plan something with her. We both spoke about it, and I planned it all. Wanted to treat her since this would be our first trip together, she even talked about splitting the trip costs, but no way I was letting that happen especially for our first trip together. We agreed the first one’s on me and we’ll figure something out for the next trip.

I wanted to surprise her and planned a trip to a resort, she had never been to one for a holiday. Leading up to this trip, feelings had grown in me. With how things were going between us, it felt mutual, in everyway. There was nothing but love in her eyes, the way she cared for me, treated me. i fell for her and I felt that she felt the same way for me too.

And on the trip, after dinner. Took her on a walk on the beach, decided to tell her how I felt about her. I said I love you to her. She responded, please don’t take this wrong way in any way. I like you so much, i love how everything is going between us. But i’m not yet ready to say I love you back to me. She still needed time for that and she didn’t want to say it to me in a situation she felt like she had to say it because I said I love you to her. She needed time.

We talked a bit about her past before, when I shared about mine as well. she was in a rough relationship with an avoidant, for almost 4 years. She went through a lot with this guy. We didn’t go much into detail at the time, I wanted her to bring it up on her own time and in time get to know about it. She has been broken up for 2 years, didn’t get into a any relationships after that. But she was still working with this guy. They built this business together with other friends, so they’ve been working professionally together for the last 2 years after the breakup with their friends.

He moved on after telling her he’d get back with her, after their breakup but moved on with someone else while keeping her hanging, so she decided then it was over. But still had to keep seeing this guy often because of the business.

So the night I said I love you to her, she brought that up again, she told me it took a really bad toll on her what he did to her. She had gotten very attached to him because she was living a really bad life with her family, bad problems, and he took her out of that life and she moved in with him. He was her comfort throughout all the bad things in her life, even though he was a bad partner to her. She is a loving, clingy person but he was avoidant, I need space kind of guy and she changed herself to match that. So she had gotten very attached to this guy.

After things ended with him, She started taking therapy as well to help with what happened. She started getting closer to her family, rebuild her connections with them, she started being independent, living alone. She was not close to her family at all during the time she was with him.

When I listened to her, I understood that it was With good reasons why she kept her distance from her family. Her dad isnt around, and her mom well not the best person and she told me why as well. But after the breakup, she was alone. She leaned back into building her independence, mend things with her family, get closer to them, started living alone.

So after she told me all this I comforted her and told her, hey look I completely understand you. There’s no rush, I wanted to be honest about how I felt for you. Just because you can’t say it back right now, doesn’t mean things between us changes. It won’t happen, it doesn’t change anything about how I feel about you.

And everything was perfect throughout the trip, we had so much fun together, made so many memories, we made love to eachother every night. It was perfect.

I never brought up or pressured her about not saying I love you back to me, didn’t even bring it up. We were the same every day, we showed up for eachother the same every day. Nothing had changed between us.

Almost every day we saw eachother, spending time with eachother.

But one night, she just texted me.

Things have gone too fast between us. I can’t pretend that things are okay between us. I don’t know why I don’t feel how I think I should feel about this, for you. I’m so confused right now. I need so much time, space to figure all of this out. Why i’m feeling this way. I’m so sorry i’m really trying to be okay. But i’m feeling so overwhelmed with everything. I don’t want to end things, i haven’t made a final decision but can you please give me some time.

I replied, it’s okay.  I understand. You can take your time and space.

She replied, i’m so sorry, please don’t be mad at me.

I replied, I’m not mad.

She then asked me if she could meet me and talk to me in person so she can tell me everything more clearly. She doesn’t want me to get the wrong idea.

Then the next day we met.

So she told me, meeting the family, they really wanted to meet me, she also did too. But after that she started feeling it happened too fast, same thing with her friends too. Then she said my affection and the way I showed it. Through touch and words and actions, they felt so good but started to feel bad because things were already overwhelming around her. And when that happens she needed space but she couldn’t tell me that because she didn’t want to make me sad or upset. Didn’t want me to change who I was. She genuinely enjoyed it. But sometimes when she need that space, she couldn’t tell me so that was also bothering her.

Also my friends, this is something i also agreed with too. My friends started joking about kids and marriage, too early. I also didn’t like that. Made them stop immediately. But that also put a lot of pressure on her and made her scared. But my friends did tell her they were sorry, please don’t take it serious, we were just joking.

And she told me something new she didn’t tell me about the guy.

So he quit the business, right after new years and before we went on our trip. So apparently it actually really hit her a lot. Because it affected the business a lot too. And she outright said it’s not like i still love him. But i just need to properly grieve that as well. And alot of things have been just making her feel overwhelmed she just needs to figure out her feelings towards everything with me, her work. She’s just feeling overwhelmed with everything. She even said me saying I love you to her and not being able to say it after till that day also made her feel very guilty and it made things very hard for her too.

After hearing all of this, I comforted her in every way to the things she told me. I didn’t give solutions, I listened and gave her comfort. I told her I understood, I want this relationship to feel good for the both of us, not just me. You are not forced to do anything, we are partners. We are in this together, I want you to happy too. Just as happy as I am. I’m glad you finally spoke about all of this and shared it with me. She said she’s also really glad she was able to finally speak up. She decided to bring it up because she didn’t want to keep holding this inside of her long enough for it to burst on me, turn into resentment. Get angry or lashing out at me. I’m the only guy who’s ever treated her this well so I don’t want to ruin this between us.

So after we talked, we walked out of the restaurant, holding hands together. Went on a drive, dropped her off home. She gave me a hug, a long one. Said i’ll see you soon with a smile and she went in. Didn’t see after for 4 days after that day. She texted me that night however, saying just wanted to say I got home safe tonight from work, and say goodnight to you. I replied and that was the last time we talked. I gave her the space and time she asked for.

4 days later, she messaged me.

She had this wisdom tooth that’s been bugging her for a while now, she just hadn’t got the time to deal with that. Financially. So she broke the silence with that topic. We spoke that day for a bit. The next day also, and the day after. Things were going well. We were laughing, having fun. She was heart reacting to my messages. Showing warmth and genuine signs of reconnecting. She hadn’t gone out since the wisdom tooth had been talking out so I haven’t really brought up inviting her out or seeing her. Plus we just started talking to I wanted to give some time and not rush. But she kept saying how bored she was at home, doing nothing. So on the third day we were talking for a bit. I went to work. Later that night I just sent her a light invitation “when you’re feeling up for it, we should grab a coffee sometime”

She didn’t reply to the message the whole night. And later that night she messaged me.

Hey, I’ve been thinking about a lot of things. I still don’t think i’m ready for a relationship. I don’t think we should continue this. It’s not fair to ask you to wait for me until I figure myself out and i don’t even want to ask you to the for me. You have been such a great guy to me.

I really hope you understand what i’m going through.

It’s just not the right time 😔 she said it like this.

I replied this is really hard to hear, but I understand what you’re going through.

I’m sorry things felt rushed that’s something I’ll take responsibility for as well. I hope you take care and i truly wish you the best.

Then she replied

Please don’t blame yourself, it’s partially my fault as well. Always take care of yourself and please be safe

Thank you so much for everything you did for me 🥺❤️

Said it just like this. I want to highlight the emojis because this is the energy she showed me.

Can you all please tell me what you think. I’m really heartbroken. I don’t know what to do anymore. I didn’t expect this to end this way. I just keep hoping that she’ll come back. I just don’t know why this had to end this way. Everything was going so well..

After the break up, i haven’t messaged her. I only just sent a heart reaction to her last message and left it. Because I didn’t want to put more pressure and guilt on her by telling her how much she meant to me, that she made so happy as well, I didn’t want to put it out there in a message. I controlled myself because she was already overwhelmed by everything, feeling guilty about having to end this.

She still follows me on instagram. Didn’t remove me or anything. She had a private account, she removed me from that however. Even the pictures she posted of us on our trip together on that account. She hasn’t been posting on her main account like she used to. She’s been very quiet after the break up. I have been respecting this break up. No matter how badly I want to reach out to her, this is i know a situation that can’t be solved by me texting her I miss her or I want her back..",3,1770468163.0,BreakUps,6,1.0,False

I’ve been mentoring juniors on and off for the past decade and there’s one thing that keeps coming up. I feel like I got to share this for the sake of the junior guys out there.

They can model. They can run FEA. Some of them are honestly better at Solidworks than I am.

But they cannot read a room.

They’ll present a design review and not notice that the manufacturing lead has been shaking his head for the last five minutes. They’ll send a drawing to a supplier without calling first to ask if it’s even feasible. They’ll argue with a machinist who has 30 years of experience about a 0.02mm tolerance instead of asking “what can you actually hold?”

Nobody teaches this in school. And honestly most companies don’t teach it either. You either figure it out or you spend your career wondering why your designs keep getting revised.

For anyone early in their career reading this… go spend time on the shop floor. Buy the machinist coffee. Ask the assembly guys what drives them crazy. That knowledge is worth more than any SolidWorks tutorial.

You can see a dramatic difference between juniors who spent time on the shop floor and the ones who didn’t. It affects their development more than their GPA or hours spent on Creo.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

So recently, it has been brought to my attention that some people have been accusing me of scamming people through the DoraeSubs Buy Me a Coffee. I've already addressed this. We use the money not just for the *Doraemon* fansubs, but also for project-related expenses like the web domain and Carrd plan. If all of our total social media followers became $5 monthly members, and we didn't have BMC's 5% cut and Stripe's processing fees, we'd have enough to pay a team ($2,735), but we don't. We only have one yearly supporter, and he joined before I cut the membership and one-off prices. I'll admit I spent their first yearly membership donation on the web domain, Carrd plan, and CapCut Pro, but that was all related to the project. We bought a web domain to make ourselves more professional. We use Carrd for our website, along with the paid plan for embeds and zero website branding (minus the domain, you have to purchase that independently), and CapCut Pro for a good video editor.

I'm an anime fan from the United States and a struggling writer and content creator who wants to create good *Doraemon* fansubs without knowing the Japanese language. Who do you think I am?

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770467706.0,FlexingReps,1,1.0,False

Don't have that ""clear/quiet mind"", clean the whole house feeling that some people get, but it's still helping more than any other med did.

It does elevate my heart, and especially if I have a coffee at any point during the morning. I have switched mainly to decaf but sometimes I really like that extra kick that a cup of coffee gives. Just curious if the elevated heart rate slows down after your body adjusts? I've been on 30 for a week. 

Also, I take it at 5:30 in the morning as I have to be to work at 7. The timing works perfectly for work and lasts pretty much until my contract hours are over (I work in education). I go to bed between 9-10 and I don't really have any trouble falling asleep, but staying asleep has been an issue. My husband snores quite loudly sometimes and if I wake up from that, there is no falling back asleep for quite a while. In fact I have to go to the guest room lately to even attempt to get back to sleep. Wondering if my body will adjust to this as well?

Overall, I feel SO much more productive and on top of things at work, so the benefits definitely are outweighing the drawbacks right now. Just curious of others experience?",1,1770467640.0,adhdwomen,0,1.0,False

My son (16) is in wrestling. Yesterday was his regional tournament to qualify for states. 

My husband and I have been together for 10 years and share a 3.5yo together. My husband has not been able to go to any of my sons tournaments due to his work schedule. I unfortunately haven't been able to attend many either because of our 3yo, lack of babysitters and it just generally being incredibly difficult to chase a 3yo in massive crowds of people when all they want to do is run the halls or use the bleachers as a jungle gym. My sons father has thankfully been there for every tournament, and so has my exs parents, so he has always had a good support system but it has made me feel super shitty that I haven't been able to really be involved. 

I spoke to my husband a week ago about how I was 100% going to this tournament and expressed wanting to find a sitter that day so I didnt have to worry about our child and could focus on my son. HE made the suggestion that he would switch days with someone so he could go and keep an eye on our child while there. I was super grateful and we had been planning and packing all week. Well, Thursday he tells me his mom wants to go too and that she wants to ride with us. This definitely bothered me from the jump because she has a habit of being late, as she has zero sense of urgency, and the ride to the location was an hour and 25 minutes. So I told him she had better be here at 7am, no later, because the event started at 8:40. 

Well, 7 rolls around and then 720. I tell my husband I am getting fucking pissed and I can 2 seconds from leaving without her. He tells me she is ""right down the street"". 10 minutes later she pulls in, comes inside and sits on my couch and tells my husband that she ""will let him"" make her a pot of coffee because she didnt have time to get herself any. I tell her we can hit dunkin and that we are late. She says she doesnt want dunkin and a pot of coffee wont take long. Instead of my husband defending me, he just starts making a pot of coffee. Our coffee pot takes 20 minutes to brew. Its old, its needs replacement. So, I just didnt say anything. I grab our child and all of our snacks and packed items and leave him and his mom at the house. He calls me at 7:56 asking where I am and I told him that I was on my way to the tournament. He is asking why we didnt wait for him and I told him I was done putting his selfish mom above our plans and I made myself clear from the moment she invited herself along. I told him my son comes first and they already made me late and that this will be the last time I depend on him for anything (he also has a habit of downplaying the importance of things that are super important to me, as being ""not a big deal""). He said it wasnt like we would have missed much from being 40 minutes late. I hang up. 

He and his mom didnt show up. I spent the entire tournament chasing our kid, outside of when my ex and his parents helped me (go figure) and missed my sons first match. My husband uses the argument that if I wanted him there and if it was important that he went than I would have waited for him. I am disgusted by him, to be blunt. But he is still pissed that I even left without him, saying I disrespected and embarassed him and that there was no way he was going to show up at a children's event angry because that would have been inappropriate. AITA?

Okay, I need to admit something: I'm a 21-year-old adult who just gasped out loud at *lipstick packaging*. My roommate thought I was watching kitten videos.

Behold: [Flower Knows Cake Lip Cream.](https://benable.com/enchantglow/flowerknow/details?detail_id=19503936)

This thing looks like someone shrunk a Parisian pastry and dipped it in pastel dreams. The ""cake"" base is this soft matte ceramic-feel pot, the ""frosting"" lid has this subtle shimmer finish, and inside? The creamiest, cloud-soft lip tint that smells faintly of vanilla and *happiness*.

I got shade **""Rose Mousse""** — this perfect dusty rose that somehow makes me look like I drink eight glasses of water and journal daily. (I do neither.) It goes on like lip balm, builds like a tint, and leaves this dreamy velvet-matte finish that doesn't crack or settle into lines.

The real magic? **I actually want to reapply it.** Not because I need to — it lasts through my morning coffee and a sad desk lunch — but because pulling this little cake out of my bag sparks *genuine joy*. The barista at my regular spot now asks to see it. My coworkers have started a collection spreadsheet.

Other shades I'm now mildly obsessed with:

* **""Caramel Soufflé""** — warm nude that flatters literally everyone
* **""Berry Parfait""** — deep plum for when you need main character energy
* **""Peach Tart""** — the perfect coral for spring delusion

Fair warning: The packaging is *not* travel-friendly if you're rough with your bags. This is a ""treat it like a tiny ceramic dessert"" situation. But for desk use, photos, and pure aesthetic serotonin? Unmatched.

Flower Knows is a Chinese brand (famous for their whole *dessert meets fairytale* vibe), but they ship globally through authorized retailers. I grabbed mine from [AMAZON](https://benable.com/enchantglow/flowerknow/details?detail_id=19503936) during a sale — think it was around $18-22 USD.

If you're someone who buys books for their covers, collects mugs you'll never use, or believes makeup should spark happiness — this little cake belongs in your collection.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

A small, olive-drab canister rolled lazily across the warped floorboards, hissing like an angry cat as pale yellow vapor began curling out from its perforated sides.

""Shit—"" Coix reacted first. Years of bad decisions and worse company had drilled certain instincts into him. He kicked the chair backward, snatched the coffee pot off the table mid-pour, and hurled the entire scalding contents at the canister in one fluid, furious motion.

Steam exploded upward as liquid met metal and gas. Bella was already moving too, faster than someone who'd supposedly been dead for two years had any right to be. He yanked a dusty wool blanket from the back of his chair and flung it over the canister like he was smothering a grease fire.

""Window!"" She barked, voice suddenly stripped of its earlier playfulness.

Coix didn't argue. He lunged for the single grimy pane overlooking desert, drove his elbow through the glass, once, twice, then kicked the remaining shards out. Dry desert wind rushed in, thin and hot, pulling some of the vapor with it instead of letting it settle.

The Duo pressed low, shoulders almost touching, breathing through sleeves. The gas wasn't the classic blistering sulfur nightmare; this was something newer, meaner, a bastard Chemist cooked up in some warlord's garage lab. It stung like tear gas on steroids, burned the eyes and throat immediately, but didn't cling or blister right away. More incapacitating than lethal in small doses—designed to scatter rather than slaughter.

Still plenty capable of killing if you sat in it long enough.

Bella coughed once, hard, then muttered through her sleeve, ""Told you this place had character.""

""You absolute lunatic,"" Coix wheezed back. His eyes streamed, the room swam in yellow haze. ""If this is your idea of special–""

""Shut up and help me."" Bella was already dragging a rusted metal cabinet across the floor to block the door. Someone outside rattled the handle, then kicked it once. Wood splintered but held.

Coix joined him, shoving with his shoulder. ""Who the hell did you piss off this badly?""

""Nobody, maybe you're blind but that bastard Grelt wanted to invade here."" Bella flashed that same infuriating grin, even with tears cutting tracks through the dust on his face. ""Figured if I was going to drag my old friend out here better have some entertainment""

The kicking outside stopped. Footsteps retreated—probably to fetch something heavier, or maybe just to wait for the gas to do its work.

Coix glared at his friend. ""You called me here to use me as bait?""

""Collateral damage,"" Bella said cheerfully. ""But look on the bright side: you're still breathing. And now you know I'm alive. That's progress.""

A low, wet cough escaped Coix. The gas was starting to settle in his lungs like hot gravel. ""I'm going to kill you myself when we get out of this.""

""Promises, promises."" Bella fished a small auto-injector from inside her jacket—military-grade, probably stolen—and jabbed it into her own thigh without hesitation, then tossed a second one to Coix. ""Stims the respiratory system, counters the worst of it. Won't feel great, but you'll walk.""

Coix caught it, stared at the label, then drove the needle home anyway. A cold burn raced up his leg, followed by a rush that made his heart slam against his ribs. The burning in his throat eased a fraction.

They crouched by the broken window, listening. 

They slipped through the shattered window one after the other, dropping into desert. Bella paused only long enough to flip the bird at the empty doorway behind them.

""Next reunion,"" Coix growled as they started jogging, ""we're doing it somewhere with actual security. And real coffee.""

Bella laughed—short, hoarse, alive. ""Deal. But only if you admit you missed me.""

1qycei9,https://i.redd.it/mtmx4z9qe2ig1.jpeg,"Málaga says goodbye to a breakfast institution, El Diamante closes after 77 years","Bar El Diamante has stopped serving breakfasts. Just like that. No noise, no drama, just the quiet clink of packing boxes where there used to be cups of coffee, toasted pitufos and the low murmur of regulars who never needed to look at a menu.

After 77 years in the historic centre of Málaga, one of the city’s most recognisable traditional bars has closed its doors. Francis Cerezo, known to everyone simply as Francis, and his wife Mariví Castillo said goodbye to their customers last Friday. The reason is not a lack of clients, nor rising rents, nor changing fashions, but something much more human, retirement and health.

Francis joined the bar in 1994 at just 22 years old, fresh out of vocational training in electricity. Three years later, following the retirement of the remaining owners, he took over the business. Since then, he has been behind the bar for more than three decades, shaping the final chapter of a story that began in 1949.

Originally opened under the name El Brillante near the Parador de San Rafael, the bar moved to Pozos Dulces after a dispute over rent and was reborn as El Diamante. Time passed, fashions changed, but inside the bar almost nothing did. The marble counter, the shelves of bottles, the original soda machine, even the furniture from the old lechería, all remained. As Mariví likes to say, “Everything is the same. Only the floor outside and the bathrooms were ever changed.”

What made El Diamante special was not nostalgia alone, but consistency. Breakfasts were honest, filling and affordable. A full breakfast with a large café con leche came in at around 3.50 euros. The most expensive pitufo barely reached 2.20. The undisputed star was the strawberry milk, made with milk and strawberry syrup from Bodega Quitapenas, a simple drink that generations of Malagueños grew up with.

Then there was the pitufo de salchichón de Málaga, a breakfast so local it almost feels like a statement of identity. No avocado experiments, no reinterpretations, just bread, product and routine.

The bar survived everything, economic crises, the arrival of franchises, nearby competitors, even the pandemic. When they were forced to close temporarily due to illness or restrictions, a simple WhatsApp status saying “Tomorrow we’re open” was enough to bring the regulars straight back through the door.

That loyalty is now turning into sadness. Customers have cried, complained half-jokingly that they will be “orphaned”, and wondered where they will go next. Social media has filled with messages of thanks and affection. For many, El Diamante was not just a place to eat, but part of their daily rhythm.

There is still a small hope. A possible generational handover, perhaps within the family, perhaps reopening later this month. But nothing is guaranteed, and even if the bar returns, the prices, the breakfasts and the spirit may not.

For now, Málaga loses another of its quiet, unpretentious landmarks. Not a trendy spot, not an Instagram favourite, but something far rarer, a place that simply did its job well, every morning, for nearly eight decades.

At oldtownmalaga.com, we believe stories like this matter. Because understanding Málaga is not only about monuments and museums, but about bars where time stood still, and where a simple breakfast could feel like home.",2,1770466784.0,VisitMalaga,0,1.0,False
1qyce9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1qyce9k/what_should_i_do_about_my_extremely_noisy/,What should I do about my extremely noisy neighbors?,"So I (27F) have been living in a rental appartement for over 5y now. The house next door is owned by an elder couple (+\\-55yo) and their kitchen is next to my bedroom.

Over the last few years I’ve tried to talk to them for over 5 times about the noise coming from a coffee machine which is placed directly beside my bed. They tend to drink a lot of coffee, starting at 6:30 in the morning, and it wakes me up almost everyday. 

They’re also really really noisy with slamming kitchen cabinets etc, but I get that it’s not possible to change the whole kitchen lay out just because I’m annoyed by the slamming cabinets. 

However, the first time I tried to talk to them I went by their house and kindly asked if we could maybe talk about their coffee machine, they said no and closed the door.

The second and third time they just didn’t open the door, and the fourth time they said “that’s a pitty” and slammed the door in my face.

After that I wrote them a letter explaining that since I’m chronically ill I spend a lot of time at home and that it would really help me if they would just move the coffee machine just a tiny bit. No reply.

A few months ago I’ve send another letter. They were doing some construction work starting at 6 in the morning (which is not allowed in my city) and they kept on drilling the entire day which made it impossible for me to follow my classes online. 

I went to google and discovered that there their is a mediator in my neighborhood if it’s not possible to talk directly to your neighbor and that if they keep annoying you you’re allowed to call the neighborhood police to mediate as well. 

I decided that I would give them one last change to talk to me about it in a civil way and if they keep ignoring me I would find a mediator.

So I’ve send them a letter explaining that I really want to talk to them and that if they don’t reply to me I will find a mediator or call the neighborhood police to mediate. 

A few weeks later I got a call from my elderly landlord, he live beneath me, and he said that the neighbors came to him to say that I was harassing them and complained about me asking for a conversation.

I found this really disturbing since I’m an adult and I’ve been asking to talk as adults and their reaction to that is to go to my landlord and complain about me asking to talk. 

I don’t know what to do now. My landlord said to leave it alone and not cause a big fight over something so small. But I’m so disturbed by the noise their making especially in the morning or late at night and I’m 100% it’s too loud of decibel to be considered mild disturbing. 

Obviously the neighbors don’t see me as an adult who they can have a conversation with and rather complain about me to my landlord who has nothing to do with this. 

But I’m afraid if I continue the plan by looking for a mediator they will go to my landlord again and I end up in a fight with my landlord. 

How can I handle this? ",1,1770466763.0,neighborsfromhell,41,0.51,False
