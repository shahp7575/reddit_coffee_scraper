When this all started she was just another girl at work however she showed genuine interest towards me and I started having a crush on her. 

I 28M, she 26F. She's been shy and nervous around me in general but approached me and had a good chat when no one was in the office while we worked late. 

Cut to recent - Since, she's shy I texted her on slack asking if she'd like to go for coffee and she said sure, came up to my desk and we went out, since it was late the nearby shops were closed and we had to have a coffee in the office cafeteria. I wanted to ask her out on a date but couldn't since there were people around. While she was leaving I asked her if she'd go for lunch over the weekend. She said she had plans but we can sort something out. 

Next week, again she was acting nervous around me so I gave her some space and didn't initiate. 

Last week, I asked her if she'd like to go outside for a coffee since this is the final week so I thought I maybe give it a final go. She said she can't today but can do tomorrow. We agreed on a time and the next day she said she's busy and apologised. I left it at that and said no issues. She texts me back right away saying how about we try again on her last day. I said sure and left it at that. 

Now to the last day, I didn't ask her cause I thought if she really wanted to she'll ask. However, since it was her last day I didn't want to seem rude so I casually walked her to say all the best for future. She said she didn't realize time just went by and said it was great to know me and hope our paths cross again.

Now wth just happened, if she didn't want to go at all why did she kept on rescheduling or is it the nerves.

I'm fine with rejection however her behaviour doesn't add up. There are ways to soft reject but this doesn't make sense.

1gmzzdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gmzzdj/30_days_caffeine_free_and_pregnant/,30 days caffeine free and pregnant ,"Tomorrow will be 30 days caffeine free for me and the end of my first trimester of pregnancy. The first 9 days or so were very rough… physical withdrawal followed by a stupor that made it really hard to function at work and home. I’m coming out of it now and feeling pretty good and getting better! I had already cut back to 1 cup a day prior to getting pregnant so the withdrawal was probably mild in comparison to many but still absolutely sucked! 

American Academy of Pediatrics has given safe guidelines for caffeine in moderation for many many years and I have lightly but consistently used caffeine in all 3 of my previous pregnancies. Learning now what I didn’t know then, I’ll always wonder if that’s why I had restless babies. 

Fetuses and even newborns can literally not metabolize caffeine. The half life for a small dose of caffeine in an (already born!) newborn is like up to 200 hours… so imagine, if you’re a new mom drinking a cup of coffee every day and your either pregnant or nursing, your baby is going to be CONSTANTLY CAFFEINATED. Does this feel right? Not for me.  

There are new studies out there finding more and more adverse correlation between fetal growth, childhood development and maternal caffeine use. Do your research… now we can all blame our coffee drinking mothers for our problems! (as if we didn’t already) 😋

Having no payroll and running on 2 people a shift sucks. How would you feel being that customer coming in and no one to help you. You would leave and go somewhere else. Imagine going into a Starbucks or a small coffee shop and they have 6 people working one shift and you think to yourself wait that’s my whole staff for a 2000 square foot building it doesn’t make sense. And then now you ad on TSA to stores and give no payroll to do this how do you think this will work. It won’t. Oh wait don’t forget to sell the BS to everyone and if you don’t you will be put on a pip. Oh wait also make sure you sell the $34.99 case deal this will make the store tons of money but they can have 3 per order but then only one works so you have to override the other two but now those don’t show up on the tracking of how many you actually sold with the promotion so now you need to write your staff up for not selling the paper. Oh and don’t forget to get rewards and if your penetration is high but still not getting them you will also get written up. Please keep writing people up so we can collect unemployment. ,4,1731119061.0,OfficeDepot,0,0.83,False

I take 2 right in the morning within the first 5 minutes I’m awake while I get my coffee started. 

To add context why I’m doing this I am a college student going for computer programming. The way my school has the program set up is the last year of the program(which I’m currently in) is supposed to emulate what actually working in the industry is supposed to be like. So they constantly throw double the work/coding projects at me. Don’t get me wrong I LOVE programming and can’t see myself doing anything else for the next 30-40 years of my life. 

I started to double up on the dosage of bupropion just to see what it could do if it was going to be more beneficial or not do anything at all. It was working like magic. My productivity was going up and I didn’t feel stressed about not meeting deadlines because I had laser focus and my mood was 10x more pleasurable than an orgasm and I’ve even turned down adult magic making in the bedroom with attractive ladies because my brain has rewired and becomes addicted to completing tasks and accomplishments. And believe me as a man before I got on these pills I would say YES a million times over but now it’s different for me. 

I have been on these pills for 2 years when I go back down to just taking 1 a day I don’t get that powerful “drive” like I do as of taking 2. This can’t be healthy for anybody to do.  I also can’t quit these drugs because it was the only one that worked with my depression without being called a “controlled substance” which my insurance won’t pay for.  Today for the first time I started to feel a random rapid heartbeat and I thought I was going to have a seizure. What can I do to increase the effects of this drug without taking 2 and abusing it?

I wanted to be honest about a few things about myself because I think it’s only fair if we’re starting fresh.

I’ve got bipolar disorder, and sometimes I go through tough phases of self-isolation or self-destructive thoughts. It affects my sleep, and honestly, I haven’t had a solid night’s sleep in years. My last big breakdown was over two years ago, and even though I’ve worked hard to feel more balanced, I’m still working on getting things on track.

Growing up, I never had a ton of friends and was always pretty selective. I lost a few along the way because of my own choices, but after getting diagnosed, I reached out and apologized to many of them. It was a huge step forward for me, but now I feel like I’m back to square one. Most people I know now, I just can’t really connect with. I’m also not much of a party or social person, so that doesn’t help.

On the brighter side, I’m into a lot of things that keep me grounded! I love taking long evening walks and good coffee. I’m a big fan of 70s-90s music, and I’m a cook by profession. I like to go fishing as well. One random fact, I collect Hot Wheels cars. It sounds silly, but for me, it’s therapeutic.

If any of this resonates with you and you’re also looking for someone to connect with on a daily basis, feel free to DM me. I’d love to chat and see where things go.",0,1731118564.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I love my job and like to serve people. This is not my first incident, there are hundreds.

The activity of couriers (SKIP, doordash, ubereats) have been very rude and entitled since past months. So what happened today was it was going very busy as usual, and a courier showed up, grabbed their food and ordered a small coffee and tea, both with 5 milk and 10 sugars, yes 10 sugars, and the audacity that he had when saying “Stir it properly the sugar sticks to the bottom, otherwise I will have to talk to your manager”. 

The rush was so much that I didn’t get time to complain it to my manager but what in the hell was that tone to talk to crew ? You are getting a FREE coffee and tea, you are adding a fuck ton of toppings there, we are doing a kind courtesy to give it to you FOR FREE. 

I have worked for all couriers but there are no rules of getting a free drink anywhere as far as I know. To all the couriers out there please act like you are getting free food, don’t abuse it.

I am not being a prick here but free food anywhere should be respected and only be ordered if you really need it. We have a lot to manage please.

I’ve made a game of trying as many as possible in the three weeks we’re here, so keen to get some recommendations and ones to avoid!

Favourites so far have been:
1. Pocari Sweat - the number of steps accrued keeps me coming back to this..
2. Suntory Vitamin W - delicious!
3. Mogu Mogu - Mango variety (enjoying the surprise solid bits!)
4. Aquarius - Citrus Blend - nice & refreshing!
5. CraftTea - Black Peach Tea
6. Match Lemon Soda

Least favourites have been:
1. Boss Black Coffee - mainly due to the shock factor of expecting an Iced Coffee style drink (hot drinks in vending machines are not a thing in the UK). Need to try this again with my expectations set!
2. Asahi Sixteen Tea - saw this and thought it might be a fruit tea & it was a challenge to finish. Perhaps I’m too used to sweet soft drinks.",5,1731117822.0,JapanTravelTips,18,1.0,False

We are two teachers, with two kids under school age, so we pay for childcare. My family members can’t help with finances or childcare because of addictions, my in-laws have passed away. 

Thankfully, we have enough from our incomes to pay for our basic living expenses. However, we’ve been paying our debt (and just the minimums on those) for several months now out of our savings. As of today, our savings account is down to $0 with only $50 left in checking for the month to buy diapers, food and gas.

Everything is maxed out and we don’t qualify for a loan consolidation due to said maxed cards. We will continue to pay our house payment, and car payment, I’m talking credit cards and student loans. 

We don’t buy red meat, cigarettes, alcohol, haircuts, nails, clothes, toys, furniture, massages, jewelry, lottery, coffee, drugs, pet food, services, we live as cheap as we can!

At what point do I just say screw it and quit paying our debts? What happens and how long does it take?

And compare if reasonable ba ang expenses ko, excluding rent and utilities. Nahihiya na din kasi ako sa parents ko. They did not give me a fixed allowance kasi. And I cannot gauge how high the prices here sa city. And I can honestly forget about financial and other matters when I am deep in my studying mode. 

I try my best to only spend 200 for my meals daily since my malapit na karenderia here. Pero sometimes napapasobra talaga dahil I buy a snack or drink, or food delivery pag sarado ang malapit na karenderia or tight ang study sched. My other expenses would include drinking water, vitamins, toiletries, oats, instant coffee na I budgeted for P1,000. 

Also, I get very ashamed din when I get food deliveries. Because it feels makasalanan sa health and pocket 😂

1gmz9mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1gmz9mk/am_i_really_that_unreasonable/,Am I really that unreasonable?,"Context: I (M25) and SO (F28) are trying to create a family with SS (6).

This entire week has been a shit show. 

To recount, it all started when SS got sick on Monday. My significant other stayed home with him for two days, causing to miss out on valuable income right now. During these two days, SS showed significant mental health strain. This all culminating with him, stabbing one of his stuffed animals and talking about how everybody would be happier if he was not alive. Absolutely heartbreaking, very concerning. Something that really set off a lot of alarm bells for everybody. During these two days, much like everybody else who is a step, I have a firm rule against children in our bed. I decided to let that go, because clearly he needed time with his mother. Do I think that should be a regular thing, no. Is it something that I can empathize with enough in this situation? Sure. I can get behind it.

Fast forward to Wednesday,  SO decides to send her son to a sleepover at BD’s. This is against court, and is something that has continuously happened for the last few weeks because she believes it to be what is best for her son’s mental well-being. I disagree, but it is what it is. What is best for one is not best for all, after watching our precious child free time be spent arguing through text message with the baby daddy, that was a bit bit of a put off. This is a continuous point of contention throughout a relationship, I believe her to be too lenient and that she needs to get the dog back on a leash, but she will always justify his shitty behavior by saying what’s best for her son. Continuously not holding him accountable for his actions, behaviors, and poor decision making. 

We will fast forward to today now, and bio dad decides that he’s going to drop off her still sick child to her work. I have no idea this is happening at the moment, I got up early and decided to surprise my significant other with coffee before I went and continue on with my plans throughout the day. This culminates with me sitting there with a sobbing child, and my significant other. The topic changes of me taking him to Grandma’s house or him hanging out with me before I go to my plans. Earlier in the day I had decided that I would get my errands done and go see my family earlier before the full swing, that we could spend together bonding after he got back from his BD. I told them both that I was heading straight out and then I wouldn’t be gone for so long.


Boi, was that the wrong fucking answer. I was told that “I don't want you around right now to be honest. Just go ,” and “ Im saying we as in me and you come 2nd when it comes to SS. Things we want to do come 2nd when hes concerned and i thought u felt that way too but have fun tonight.”


Frankly, we all have hard days. After this last week of compromising every boundary, watching my significant other spend our valuable time arguing with the pathetic sack of shit she decided to procreate with, then be told that I put everybody’s second is ridiculous. I am looking for advice to see if I am truly being unreasonable, or if I am catching flack for what I feel is a lack of parenting. Or if I am catching misdirected anger. This has been a hard week for everybody, and I’m definitely not lacking sympathy. This is horrible. But I don’t feel as though me getting rid of my errands and spending my time on my day off with my family for a brief amount of time so we could all be together later with such a terrible thing.

Anybody have any advice?  feedback? Just want to tell me that I was wrong? I can handle it, but I do want to see what everybody else thinks of this.",0,1731117217.0,stepparents,6,0.5,False

I have a hypothesis - I take Adderall for ADHD and also drink coffee in the morning and I've always struggled to keep my blood pressure under control. My hypothesis is that tirz (or cagri which I also take in small doses) acts to reduce the effect of stimulants, so then I take more caffeine and Adderall, which increases my blood pressure.

The concert is part of Maltz’s 70-city North American tour. “Hearing these pieces on a Viennese fortepiano helps the music come alive in a new, extraordinary way” says Maltz, adding, “I’ll introduce each piece and, post-concert, the audience can ask me questions and see this rare instrument up close.” Daniel Adam Maltz is the leading fortepianist of his generation — touring more than 70 cities in 2024. Based in Vienna, Austria, he specializes in Viennese Classicism, especially the works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven performed on the rare Viennese fortepianos of their era.

He joined them first as a temporary replacement for Lew DeWitt, after DeWitt heard him singing at a ski resort and recommended him. Jimmy was hired as a permanent replacement in August of 1982. Fortune quickly lived up to his name. He wrote the group’s second No. 1 hit, “Elizabeth,” on their 1983 album Today, and followed that with two more No. 1 hits–“My Only Love” and “Too Much On My Heart”. Fortune also wrote the top-10 hit “Forever” from 1986’s Four for the Show and co-wrote the top-10 hit “More Than a Name on the Wall” from 1988’s The Greatest Hits. Jimmy has performed in all of the U.S. States, in Canadian Provinces, and in front of audiences as large as 100,000. He was part of the Statlers’ annual Happy Birthday USA celebration in Staunton, Virginia, for 14 years. He also sang on many of the Statlers’ gold, platinum, and double platinum recordings. Jimmy’s career included The Nashville Network’s popular “The Statler Brothers Show” which aired for seven seasons. Jimmy and The Statler Brothers were inducted into the GMA (Gospel Music Association) Hall of Fame on October 29, 2007, and inducted into the CMA (Country Music Association) Hall of Fame in June 29, 2008. After the Statler Brothers retired on October 26, 2002, Jimmy seized the opportunity to launch a solo career to share new music with his fans. Tickets are available online, in-person at the New River Community College Business Office in advance or at the door. Cash or check only for in-person sales.

Based in Vienna, Austria, he specializes in Viennese Classicism, especially the works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven performed on the rare Viennese fortepianos of their era.

All local veterans and the public are invited to enjoy and watch the festivities of the annual Veterans Day Parade. The tradition of honoring the men and women who have served honorably in the military during times of war and peace is very important. Participation in the parade helps to express this appreciation and to insure that this tradition is passed from generation to generation. The parade starts at the Mayberry Funeral Home located at 367 South Locust Street and will proceed north on Route 8 then turn right at the stop light and end at the area of Wood Funeral Home along Barberry Road. There will be two plaques awarded for the most patriotic and best decorated participants in the parade. There will also be a drawing for all Veterans who participate in the parade to win a prize. The assembly for the parade will be at 1:00 PM at the Mayberry Funeral Home. The Floyd County Woman’s Club will be hosting a USO type canteen providing hot coffee and hot cider for all parade participants.

New River Community College's Concert Series presents An Evening with Jimmy Fortune. Jimmy Fortune toured, sang and performed with the legendary Statler Brothers for 21 years. He joined them first as a temporary replacement for Lew DeWitt, after DeWitt heard him singing at a ski resort and recommended him. Jimmy was hired as a permanent replacement in August of 1982. Fortune quickly lived up to his name. He wrote the group’s second No. 1 hit, “Elizabeth,” on their 1983 album Today, and followed that with two more No. 1 hits–“My Only Love” and “Too Much On My Heart”. Fortune also wrote the top-10 hit “Forever” from 1986’s Four for the Show and co-wrote the top-10 hit “More Than a Name on the Wall” from 1988’s The Greatest Hits. Jimmy has performed in all of the U.S. States, in Canadian Provinces, and in front of audiences as large as 100,000. He was part of the Statlers’ annual Happy Birthday USA celebration in Staunton, Virginia, for 14 years. He also sang on many of the Statlers’ gold, platinum, and double platinum recordings. Jimmy’s career included The Nashville Network’s popular “The Statler Brothers Show” which aired for seven seasons. Jimmy and The Statler Brothers were inducted into the GMA (Gospel Music Association) Hall of Fame on October 29, 2007, and inducted into the CMA (Country Music Association) Hall of Fame in June 29, 2008. After the Statler Brothers retired on October 26, 2002, Jimmy seized the opportunity to launch a solo career to share new music with his fans. Tickets are available online, in-person at the New River Community College Business Office in advance or at the door. Cash or check only for in-person sales.

So now I'm looking for pathways that lead back home in 10 years or so. The best idea I see is some type of farming based on coffee, pimento, or castor oil as these have a foreign market that works at several scales.

Start engaging with her more like an equal adult rather than a family member. Avoid terms like ""sis"" or ""little brother"" and speak to her in a way that reflects maturity and independence.



2. Spend Time Together in Non-Sibling Contexts

Do activities together that aren’t typically family-oriented, like going to a movie, hiking, or grabbing coffee. Create shared experiences outside the family setting.



3. Don't be playful 

Messing around chasing eachother (before in a romantic relationship) can be deadly, it's like lion cubs, when they play with eachother and they bond and connect through that as ""family"", so just avoid it if possible. At the same time do Don't be afraid to touch eachother, like a simple tap on the shoulder.

1gmyxwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3snark/comments/1gmyxwd/yoav_gallant_is_not_a_moderate_voice/,Yoav Gallant Is Not a 'Moderate' Voice,"I am exhausted by Ethan’s insistence on portraying Yoav Gallant as a “moderate” voice in the Israeli cabinet. Gallant was the defense minister who directly oversaw a genocide in Gaza, resulting in a MINIMUM of 50,000 direct deaths. Realistically, the death toll likely ranges between 100K-200k. As an epidemiologist, I know that in most conflicts and atrocities, epidemiological methods are often used to estimate death tolls, and these figures rely on capturing both direct deaths and indirect deaths. The 50,000 figure is ONLY direct deaths.

When you factor in indirect deaths with an extremely conservative 2:1 ratio, you’re already at over 100,000 casualties. In most conflict zones, indirect fatalities reach between 5-15 deaths per direct death due to starvation, disease, and infrastructure collapse. Gaza’s circumstances are even more severe; people there live in what is effectively an open-air prison, with no access to trade and a shattered infrastructure, making the real indirect death toll much higher. I wouldn’t be surprised if the ratio in Gaza reaches 5:1, at minimum.

In today’s world, orchestrating a genocide in a politically feasible manner doesn’t always mean direct mass killings, it’s about creating conditions that guarantee massive indirect fatalities. Thats how you get away with it, by inflicting just enough direct deaths to trigger a humanitarian crisis, and then restricting resources to ensure that starvation, disease, and a collapse in healthcare infrastructure will lead to further loss of life; Gallant and others can weaponize these conditions as tools of genocide. This genocide in Gaza wasn’t incidental but was coldly calculated. By who? YOAV GALLANT. Israel has weaponized starvation, disease, infrastructure collapse, atrocity propaganda, and cynically framed civilian deaths as unavoidable collateral damage or outright blaming Hamas, to systematically eliminate a population and get away with it.

Gallant has an arrest warrant application for a reason. Just because he committed a genocide AND called for an investigation into October 7th, advocated for hostages’ release, and does not oppose Haredi exemptions from military service does not make him a moderate. He may be open to appealing to the Israeli public on domestic issues, but he still orchestrated the slaughter of tens, likely hundreds, of thousands of Palestinians. Ethan’s portrayal of Gallant as a moderate feels like a deliberate attempt to scapegoat Netanyahu and sanitize Israel’s other leaders, as if saying, the rest of Israel isn’t so bad, it’s just Netanyahu. No it is not, it is an extremist ultranationalist society that has laws on the books ensuring one set of people are superior to the others.

I am Palestinian, I have talked about how I compartmentalized by identity to watch H3H3 for years. I figured Ethan was a liberal and if we just sat down for coffee he would find it in him to see the humanity in me. By the way, Hila was literally conducting raids the same time I was in Ramallah. Glad to know I was living in what he considers a ""terrorist city"". Him framing Ramallah that way was very telling of how Israel isolates its citizens from us and indoctrinates them into thinking we're all some barbaric animals. I think much of this staunch support for Israel and the genocide is because he is stuck in a bubble. He probably has family on his side and Hila's that he does not want to disappoint (I know how difficult being in this position can be); that combined with isolating himself in an echo chamber like Destiny's community allowed his absolute derangement on this issue to fester. I literally do not know what I will do if I hear him call what's happening in Gaza a humanitarian crisis again. I do not have any immediate relatives in Gaza (I do in Palestine, I was born and raised there and often go back to visit) but I have distant family (who I never met) in Gaza. Last I heard, some of them raised enough money from their immediate family to get medical help in Egypt. This is going to sound unbelievably sad, but I heard one of these distant relatives survived the atrocities of Gaza only to be hit by a car when she arrived in Egypt. She's alive and is doing fine, but what the hell man, these people have gone through hell and this man cannot find it in him to humanize us. We watch the same movies as him, listen to the same music, eat the same food, laugh the same way; we are not some abstract idea of what he has been taught to believe barbaric animals are. We are normal people who just look and speak differently.",43,1731116216.0,h3snark,1,1.0,False

The ticket includes admission to the discussion, a signed copy of the Songbird and the Heart of Stone, and admission to the signing line to meet both authors and get a photo, alongside getting your books signed/personalized by Carissa. I feel like there was a limit (6 books or so) specified somewhere, but I have been unable to find it mentioned when I looked today. I also am able to provide proof of purchase via DM.

1gmyvg9,https://i.redd.it/3xx3so1o4szd1.jpeg,What is the PERFECT work schedule to support an apprenticeship?,"TL;DR, my main question is - in a perfect world, what is the IDEAL work schedule to support/work around an apprenticeship?

For context, I work roughly 20 hours per week at a coffee shop. I have the same days off every week. My current schedule is opening shifts (anytime between 5am-noon) although if I wanted to change this or the days I work, my manager is very flexible.

I live with my parents and will continue to do so if I get an apprenticeship, so it is not necessary for me to work any more than this.

A recurring debate I see on this subreddit is the concept of being a part-time apprentice. In this context, it's usually an issue of only having 1-2 days of the week fully available. 

In my situation, I have plenty of free time but only at a certain daypart. For example, I am available every single day of the week, but only past noon on most of them. Is this something I need to change in order to a support an apprenticeship?

Is it standard to come in as an apprentice for the entire day at the shop? Is it necessary to have entire days from morning to night available, or is it something I can do every day, but only for half-days?

I'm sure every shop's expectations are different, but I'm just trying to feel out how much of it varies and how much of it is industry standard.

(I had long suspected which is why I went to see her). She initially prescribed me Atomoxetine. The reason is because I have anxiety and I can’t drink coffee without getting the jitters. She also beleive that the anxiety is tied to the adhd. She said she preferred to not give me a stimulant which I’m fine with because I’ve heard so many negative things about these medications. 
Well all the Atomoxetine did for me was make me feel weird and angry and killed the urge to bite and pick at my nails (yay?). After a month she prescribed me Wellbutrin which I took for 2 days and came off of because I couldn’t be bothered with all the horrible side effects. Lastly she prescribed me Methylsomething something but my insurance needed authorisation and I’m not sure if she ever sent it and I never heard back from the insurance or her. 
Honestly I never reached out back to her either because I’m not sure if I’m interested in being medicated indefinitely especially since I’ve gotten this far in life without it. 
I’m not 100 % sure what my questions is.

Lucil watched from the side of the stage across the crowd, as she tried to spot that intruder again. They had hit her quite badly near the start with those blasted rubber bands, but she had returned the favor in kind—one of their eyes was scratched out, and she had hit their limbs several times.

She glanced as they moved close to the stage, and a thought crossed her mind. Were they really going to destroy the stage? She *couldn’t* let them stop Point A\*B, so she had to make this quick. Teleporting away, she grabbed a garbage bin and teleported it between the streamer and the stage, before lunging at them from behind.

Their odd fashion choice made it tricky, but by now she knew to hit them in the head—something she quickly followed up with by having her Stand dunking the bin over them, and then unleashing all her frustration and fury with blow after blow after blow.

Eventually she stopped, grabbing onto the bin and lugging it out of the concert. She would have pretended she wasn’t involved with it, but she didn’t care about the rumors the crowd spread.

Lucil ignored the gawkers staring at her, grabbing the bin and lugging it towards the exit, where she looked at it in disdain. “Fuck you, get a real life.”

With one last kick, the bin along with Nojus were tossed out of the venue. Where they both belonged.

Satisfied, Lucil began to head back to the concert before she noticed someone yanking at the glove on her left hand. Quickly, she began to resist the pull, looking to see some determined teen trying to pull it off. Right—that streamer had said that there would be some kind of reward if her glove was taken off. She pushed the kid off of her, holding her arm closer to her chest. “What the hell are you doing?” Lucil cried, feigning ignorance of the rumors surrounding her.

Before she could continue, Lucil was caught off guard by a kick from the side, as a small group of students jumped in to yank the glove off her arm. “Don’t you mess with our concert!” The older of the group laughed at her, triumphantly holding the glove up in the air as if it were a prize, before the group ran off within the crowd. Lucil would be thinking about how that victorious feeling wouldn’t last as they find out the reward was just a rumor, but she wasn’t.

She stared at her uncovered arm as panic started to settle in—but as she thought more and more, she came to a realization which calmed her, as she looked back to the stage:

She was close. So close.

Close to an easy, happy life, unburdened from suffering, that she alone belonged to. She’d push through, make it so, no matter what.

She turned back towards the stage, not looking at the performance. She was not forgetful.

No matter what.

**Scenario: Mount Parapollah — 10:17 AM**

“This place looks good, right?”

A chilling wind brushed against the mountain, whipping the greenery into a mad dance. Below sat a field of flowing grass, overlooking a cliffside. At its far edge sat an impeccable wall of clotted earth, atop which a shadow rested. To its side, a recently repainted fence sat above the cliffside. 

Some of those blades of grass were crushed under the foot of a passing child—one of the children Hava cared for at [the Haven](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1bxq97k/), John. He trotted across the open field, heading for the dark nook.

“This place looks good, right?” He yelled back towards another approaching child. He pointed off towards a far cliff, “I call that side!” 

“Why there?” Anha raced up behind John with a ball in hand. Her eyes scanned the edge of the adjoining cliff, where they caught the bright, blistering reds of fresh I-beams and the cold, gray colors of concrete, grime, and steel.

It was a monstrosity, once. An ambling amalgamate of stone, iron and steel that could’ve held life in its hands, much like the field below it now did. Where it once could’ve blotted out the sun, it now slept beneath it, decaying against the mountainside. Life moved on, and into its form, with some vibrant green grass jutting from the dirt comingling with its rebar bones.

“It looks like somebody tried building somethin’ up there-” Her eyes circled back down to John, “-didja do that yourself, John?”

“It’s fine! It’s way too big n’ heavy to fall right now!” Satisfied with his own deduction, John raced to the other end of the field, heading right for the edge of the cliff. 

The chilling wind churned against the steel beams above the boy’s head as he drew near, but John was unafraid. Even as the dust, dirt and grime of wasted time was ripped clean from its beams, John didn’t pay it any mind. “Come on, kick it!”

Even though the pair could barely see each other from across the field, Anha dropped the ball into a waiting foot, and started racing for John’s end of the field.  He watched her approach, and started racing for the side of the wall. He couldn’t gauge her speed until she was closer still, and even then, he wasn’t too sure of how far he’d have to go to stop her.

Then it hit him, all at once. She was right up on a far section of the wall, sending him into a frenzy. John scrambled for the ball, digging his hands into the earthen wall for leverage. He was behind, and he was about to be behind a point, too, when he thought he’d heard something.

He tried to shake the noise off, but he couldn’t brush past it—something loud was overhead. Dirt spilled onto his face, and he turned his head up to see where it was coming from. 

The boy’s widening eyes looked up to see a falling girder, coming right for him.

Anha didn’t have time to scream before the ground pulled itself from underneath her feet, sending her toppling backwards. She felt the crash of the girder in her spine as the noise hit her ears. She scrambled to her feet all at once, watching the dustcloud loom in the distance.

“John!” She screamed, her voice barely registering over the sound of ringing metal. “**John!**” She could feel the sound in her throat, but it never reached her ears.

While Anha fell into a coughing fit from the flying dust, she kept her eyes open, staring out at the field before her. In the middle distance, she could swear that she spotted something rising from the earth.

Anha’s eyes opened wide in horror as she watched as an earthen cocoon, much like a flower bulb, opened before her. Within the bulb’s center sat John: shivering, but unharmed. He pulled himself out of the bulb, and sauntered over to the ball. “Let’s find somewhere else, Anha…”

The winds churned the mountainside, and the earth slipped away, letting the dirt slide back to whence it came.

**Scenario: Red Velvet Country Club, Vasitanagarh — 3:07PM**

Vasitanagarh was littered with coffins.

They were not filled with bodies, but with a singular idea and the cold, hard metal that was forged to defend it.

Once they would have been called factories, or offices, or depots. Still, they were trafficked by the employees of Zuantou Rail. But the weight of death loomed heavily, the spirit of the CEO choking the place long after her unseemly demise.

It had become clear in light of recent events that the woman who had helmed this company may have seemed larger than life at times, but it ended there—her depravity stained these streets, seeped into the foundations of these buildings and the foundations of Vasitanagarh. Coffins that had been nailed into the floorboards of the district, spires that stood, rusted over and clawing into the sky.

Zuantou Rail held up the district like the beams of a house: establishing and managing the transit system that brought Vasitanagarh its wealth, employing many of its citizens across multiple fields, and donating to its institutions to further enmesh the company into the community. Even if the company’s ultimate fate would be decided in the board and the courtrooms, neither it nor the district could unilaterally abandon the other.  Zhengqi and Vasitanagarh were a package deal—they needed a properly sharpened sword to split them apart in one clean slice, if such a thing did exist.

To that end, the community had gathered in the Red Velvet Country Club to determine what to do with these coffins—with all the attention given to the Metropolis Suite, the district’s town hall couldn’t hold the crowd. 

Even if they couldn’t formally participate in whatever decision Vasitanagarh came to, many wanted to make themselves heard, whatever that meant to them. Everyone agreed that Zuantou’s properties needed to be cleared out, but the question of who would reclaim them remained. 

People across the city had agitated for more public housing, and here was seemingly the perfect opportunity for it. However, if Zuantou closed down, the economic support it gave to Vasitanagarh would dry up with it. Thus, some argued, the abandoned factories and firms should be reopened, maybe even under the district’s or citizens’ ownership.

This meeting had gone on for hours and was running over. Countless people had been crammed into the country club’s ballroom, some relegated to standing room only. Angelino and Inago had been lucky enough to arrive early, grabbing seats by the front podium. Angelino’s arms were crossed, his gaze set squarely on each speaker, even as many in the audience grew tired or were too eager for their time with the microphone.

However ready Angelino was to rip the band-aid off and start *doing* something already, he was surprisingly at ease. Thoughts of how much better they could optimize their efforts if they had got to tearing down the properties passed as Angelino closed his eyes and steadied his breath—recent meditation techniques that tempered the rumbling furnace in his chest. They were here to listen, and they had already learned plenty.

Inago had been dutifully jotting down notes. A few corporate officers explained that many of Zuantou’s properties had been acquired across Rakin City at below market rates, earmarked for major expansions to company operations, only to fall into disuse after a few months, if they were ever used at all. Vehicle engineering firms, supply line stops, manufacturing factories, technical support offices—all spun up and stopped at a maddening pace, their budgets redirected elsewhere. Given these projects’ relatively low costs, no one in Zuantou or Vasitanagarh had looked too much into it, until now.

After a brief round of applause, Inago leaned over to Angelino and gave a heavy sigh. “Man, the Suite being exposed is bringing out a lot of wounds… most of which I didn’t even realize were wounds just a few months ago.”

“There’s a lot of work to do. I guess this is supposed to be the hard part?”

“So it seems. Our work here is certainly cut out for us—there must be another factory, office building, campus every two blocks. Sure, there’s more to it, but even just the first step is probably going to take ages.”

“What the hell was even the point of half of them? I didn’t think you’d get that much demand for factory work.”

“They’re surprisingly…scatterbrained. The electrical grid’s strained enough, but those projects started as abruptly as they stopped, jumping from one thing to the next. I guess when you have that much money, you can afford to do that.”

“Mmm.” Angelino grimaced at the thought. Zhengqi had been like a runaway train, an engine that consumed whatever it could in order to keep moving forward. Zuantou Rail had grown exponentially as a result, but where that train led and at what costs, they still knew frustratingly little.

“Which leaves us figuring out what to do with the wreckage left behind. It’s gonna be hard to *decide* what, but the more people come out, the more we can hear ‘em out—even if that means if we have to reach out to them.” Inago’s excitement at the prospect escaped in every word. It kept Angelino focused, to see his friend’s passion.

Despite all that fire in his heart, Angelino only needed a blunt response. Turning to Inago, he offered a genuine smile. “That’d be nice.” 

“We’ll take a thirty-minute break—plan to reconvene at around 3:40, please.” As the speaker announced a short recess, the Riders returned from their own conversation to the event at large.

“Speaking of which, we should go find our contact.” Angelino immediately hit his stride, shimmying his way through the throng. Inago followed close behind, slowed by having to constantly adjust his Ace to fit through the gaps in the tide.

Their contact had told them to look for a mixologist in a cherry red bowtie and eyepatch; it was easy to spot such a man resting his back against a far wall underneath the light of a window. Vira One-Eye was the name he’d chosen when he’d broken the story on Zhenqi, and his appearance here corroborated the name.

He’d noticed their footsteps and angled his head to watch the pairs’ approach. He stuck out a hand in their direction as Inago and Angelino closed in. “Afternoon, gents! Are you the ones my friend told me were looking for a mixologist?”

Inago met Vira’s grasp first, while the man had to extend his other hand for Angelino. “Yeah, a particular mixologist…” Inago’s eyes bored up into Vira’s lonely eye. “... one who used to work on the mountain.”

Vira rolled his head towards his left shoulder, using it to point at the open door. “Prying eyes and ears, detective,” he spoke in a hushed whisper, but the strength of his voice quickly returned, “Let’s go get a drink, yeah?”

---

The three stepped in turn, with Vira’s long legs keeping him just ahead of the other two as they made their way to whatever coffee shop he mentioned.

Angelino spoke first, breaking the thrum of the noise wall. “So, you used to ‘work’ on the mountain, right?” He slipped up next to Vira, just in case the man couldn’t hear his question. “What does that have to do with Zauntou, exactly?”

Vira stifled another laugh. “Aside from [its corporate head taking my left eye](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1dwce2u/), there’s quite a few things I know about.” Vira tapped the center of his forehead. ”Some details have gotten a bit fuzzy, since I was cut off from the source of my father’s will.”

Angelino stopped moving for a moment, and Inago rolled up to Vira’s left side. “So then it’s true, you were a part of the mountain spirit that made people go missing?” He received a curt nod in response to the question. “So you’d know better than anyone what’s going on up there, huh?”

Vira shook his head. “Not anymore. [Graha](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1blewuc/) was the one tasked with keeping the mountainside clean, and neither his nor [Navin’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1bi6aha/) memories are floating in my head.” Vira tapped the side of his skull. “It’s freeing, to be alone with your thoughts. My brothers used to attack them openly, back when we were all a part of something we figured was greater than ourselves…” It was a common story, unfortunately. Overhearing this much wouldn’t cast suspicion on the trio, but it was still something. “As for Zuantou’s involvement, we weren’t the only ones who ‘made hitchhikers and the like disappear’.”

Angelino rolled back up to Vira’s right side, walking in lockstep with the other man. “So there’s more to that report on the disappeared people?” Vira handed out another curt nod for the question. “Do you have numbers, or evidence, something we can use-”

“Not personally.” His eye looked to the other side of the street, watching passersby standing outside of closed businesses, while others tried to sell rare baubles on the street in the face of it. “My brothers, however, have been staying with Hāvā of late, and they’d know far more.”

Inago, in turn, brought the trio into lockstep as they rolled down the street. The passersby gave them ample room, even if some weren’t the happiest about it. He rolled the thought around in his head for a few moments, letting it simmer. “If you know all of this, and have personal history with Zuantou and those affected, why can’t you help them?”

Vira looked to the horizon, his head held high. “I’m not going back to the mountain. I like this life I’ve carved out here, among the people of Rakin, far too much for that.” He turned to Inago, to let his eye meet the man’s eyes. “A part of me, however, still feels that I should see my old man to his rest.”

As Vira turned away, Inago gave a small nod of—if nothing else—acceptance. “So then, if you don’t mind my asking, why us?”

Vira stopped in the street, and pointed up at the sign above their heads. “Here we are, and-” He turned his one eye on Inago once more, “-aside from a friend of mine living in one of your empty filing cabinets… you came here today of your own volition, no?” He gave Inago another smile. “This city needs heroes, and heroes need quests, right?”

Vira popped the handle on the door. “This is Leaves and Beans, one of my favorite places!” He stepped over the threshold. “Come on, I’ll introduce you both to the owner, she’s a good friend of mine!”

The pair looked to one another before looking at Vira's beaming smile. Today, he was just another client, and they were the ones he’d asked to give the job. Was there anything more that they needed?

**Scenario: Mount Parapollah — 10:17 AM**

Many often illegal projects have been started and abandoned on the surface of Mount Parapollah. While the members of IMPACT have done good work in turning the local law enforcement agencies against these dark dealings, it hasn’t stopped others from trying to pick up the pieces or start further away from prying eyes.

Even in the face of angered mountain spirits interrupting construction sites, or worse still, [corporate negligence,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/17n8v7g/) new projects appeared and disappeared across the mountainside, week after week, leaving whatever they’d managed to create to rot in their wake.

Despite all of this, the mountain remains beautiful. Its lush hillside gives way to sheer cliffs overlooking Rakin proper, and its treeline stretches far up enough to provide shade on any day. Some of this cover makes for perfect napping spots, while others take to guardian secluded groves in odd-angled faces.

Perhaps because of this beauty, a pair of travelers found themselves scaling the mountain. Well, calling them a pair would be odd, as to any Standless onlookers Paranoia would be alone, talking to herself on her way up the mountain, but Markov was here with her nonetheless.

“Aw~fully pretty in here, isn’t it?” Paranoia chirped, a bit louder than necessary, staring up at the mountains surrounding the pair. She paused, hearing no response, and turned to Markov, who was crouching next to a small patch of flowers. She cleared her throat. *”Aw~fully pretty in here, isn’t it?”*

“Ah! Yes, I sup-pose it is.” Markov jolted a little bit at that, floating to a ‘stand’. “Apologies. I was considering if one of these flowersmay suit Rasna’s fan-cy... But they’renot her colors.”

Paranoia’s eyebrow twitched. Lately, all Markov seemed to talk about was Rasna! Every single word out of her mouth was [Rasna Rasna Rasna](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1g6y49n/)! It wasn’t actually that common of an occurrence, but Paranoia didn’t think that hard about these sorts of things. It pissed her off! This was her alone time with Markov, her dearest most wonderful friend, and—

“Para-noia?”

“Gyak!” The virus yelped, swiveling around to face a concerned looking Markov. It was difficult to find emotions on a face that wasn’t there, but Paranoia usually managed. “Ah! I was just taking in the view, is all! Tee-hee!”

“...Yes, I suppose itis quite the nice view.” Markov nodded. “But we shouldn’t get too off-task. We *are* here for a fav-or, yes?” 

“...I *guess.*” Paranoia sighed, and Markov chuckled at that, floating forward. They’d been given a request to look into: an old construction site Brighid had visited a few months back that needed some investigation. Markov was a little surprised she had even been *asked*—she hadn’t exactly had the best track record of going off on her own, and Paranoia was probably even riskier. But she didn’t really feel like going off and starting problems, either, so maybe this *was* the right idea—

**CLANG!**

Oh. Paranoia was throwing knives at something. Sorry, Brighid.

“Paranoia!” The Stand rushed forward, placing her intangible hands on the virus’s shoulders. “What in the wor-ld are you—”

“We got *trouble*,” Paranoia growled, pointing her knives at a pair of very agitated looking men. Markov squinted. Didn’t she know that guy from somewhere...? Her eye widened.

Staring down at her was Angelino Caballero. She knew of the man - a friend of Rasna’s was a friend of hers, and she’d spoken of the man *plenty* of times. His outstretched arm, hardened by some sort of armor, had grabbed one of Paranoia’s knives right out of the air, just before it had collided with the flustered looking man standing behind him. She didn’t recognize them - and that checkered fedora looked pretty recognizable.

“Stand users.” Paranoia readied her weaponry, pens and knives gripped between her fingers. “Let’s take care of em, kay~? Then we can get back to our little evening retreat!”

Markov hesitated.

“No, i don’t-think we will.” The Stand sighed, floating in front of Paranoia. “Angelino, correct?”

“...That’s correct.” The man finally spoke, heaving a sigh and dropping the knife. He stepped forward. “I don’t believe we’ve ever met. Where do you know me from?”

“Rasna’s told meabout you. She spoke *quite* fond-ly.” The Stand floated forward, bowing slightly. “Markov. I believe she’s likely toldyou plenty about me. A pleas-ure.”

“I don’t think I can say the same.” Angelino sighed. “She has said a bit about you, and I do appreciate the... Hospitality, but that small woman over there just threw a knife at my friend.”

“Ah. Yes. She does-that. Haha.”

“...”

“Paranoia, I would like it if you put those weap-ons away.” Markov turned, clasping her hands together. “These men are our allies. Prob-ably.”

Paranoia grimaced. It didn’t matter if they were! This was her special wonderful evening retreat with her special wonderful friend! It was already hard enough to find time to talk to her anyway, and everyone else had started to ignore her! It’s annoying! This is annoying! That guy just called her short! Paranoia had a long tradition of handling things that annoyed her in the most rational manner possible—extensive amounts of knife-based violence. She crouched down slightly, and Angelino narrowed his eyes.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” He stepped forward, a calm fury in his voice. “There’s no need to fight. I’ve had my fair share of senseless violence. Really, there’s no point in any of this. It would be *stupid*.” He ran a hand through his hair and sighed, heavily. “Your friend asked you to stop, didn’t she? I don’t see the appeal in ignoring those close to you.”

Paranoia’s eyes widened at that. Her grip on her weaponry loosened, slightly. She’d moved too quickly. What *would* Markov have to say? Markov might talk to her less if she ignored a direct request. She couldn’t have that. Absolutely unacceptable. But this guy was *really* pissing her off, too, talking to her like she was some sort of child! What did he know! But... The attention...

Paranoia stuffed her knives back into her pockets with a loud *harrumph!*. “Fine! I’ll play nice! But only if he apologizes!”

Angelino seemed more annoyed by that than the prospect of knife-murder. “...For what? You were going to-” He received a light elbow to the side from his compatriot, one Kibo Inago, and sighed again. “...Apologies. I’ll be more considerate, Miss...?”

“I’m Paranoia!” She jabbed a thumb to her chest, sneering. “Better remember it! We’re here on private business, so don’t get too nosy!”

“And I’m Inago!” Inago smiled, having already moved down the mountain to give Markov a handshake. 

Paranoia watched with utter disdain. This guy should be giving *her* a handshake! They were talking about Rasna with each other. Rasna Rasna Rasna! This chick got way too much screen time!

“You don’t seem too pleased.” Angelino was standing in front of her now. When’d he do that?! Guys who sneak around are so annoying.

“Of course I’m not.” Paranoia grumbled. “I swear, everyone I’ve talked to today keeps talking about *Rasna*. It’s all about her!”

“She’s a woman who sparks conversation.”

“Too much conversation.” The virus sighed. “I suppose you’re gonna tell me she’s the coolest person ever and everyone loves her cos she’s just the best, right?”

“...No. That would probably get on your nerves.” He chuckled softly - it didn’t feel all that joyful. “But your friend is happy, isn’t she? You don’t seem too happy for her.”

“...I just think she could stand to talk about me more, is all. It’s so rude! Grrr...”

Angelino winced. Oh, *that* was what he was dealing with. Maybe he shouldn’t have apologized. He struggled for a moment to figure out how to approach this topic without giving Paranoia reason to attack him again. “You could just talk to her about the person she’s talking about? You just have to make conversation, and she’ll talk to you. I don’t understand-”

“But she’s talking about someone else.”

“Well, yes. That’s how most conversations happen.”

Whatever incredibly profane remark Paranoia was about to make was cut off by the approaching Inago, with a smile and a “by the way, we found a hole in the side of the mountain. You folks *are* investigating something, right? It might be good to go in together. Strength in numbers.”

Paranoia glared. Well, Markov sure had gotten on great with this guy. Lovely. Wonderful. What was even his name anyway? Ingo? Whatever.

“Fine. Sure. Great. I don’t care.” Paranoia gave possibly the world’s least enthusiastic thumbs up, and Angelino winced.

“...Well,” Inago sighed. “Let’s be on our way, then.”

**Scenario: Somewhere beneath Mount Parapollah — 12:35 PM**

At the center of this underground world deep in the mountain was hollowed out stone, once tall and proud, mined for parts and replaced with steel and scaffolding. The Riders had heard of the labs and storehouses in [Port Konwar](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1dyofem/) and [Vasitanagarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1e0b230/), each littered with all manner of implements—coated with rubber, covered with wires, hanging from the ceiling.

This lab was even more slapdash. Tools had been strewn about, and the skid marks and dust at the feet of hospital beds suggested that they hadn’t been moved all at once. Their occupants were scattered across the cavern even more haphazardly, some still covered in their beds, others faintly crawling to the beat of some unseen pulse.

A dried stream of what looked like motor oil, which stretched along the grout, ran to an operating table against the back of the room, where another one of these bodies laid. Beside it was a series of less humane instruments, namely a sawzall, an electric chainsaw, and a blowtorch. 

With a touch, a crouched-over Angelino identified it as dried blood.

“Inago!” Angelino called out to his partner as he examined the body. His nose crinkled as a sharp exhale burned away the smell of rot. Male, mid-20s, mole beneath his left eye—the description matched that of a hiker who had gone missing months ago. They didn’t have time to perform a field-autopsy, but a quick check of the hiker’s injuries showed that they were consistent with a sudden fall. Yet the grafted robotics were beyond merely dressing the injury, replacing limbs, organs, and even parts of his skull.

Indeed, there were more bodies in various states of “casting,” their estimated times of death spanning years. Some had been saved, the more recent had been killed in some act of twisted mercy. But the most recent had more extreme transformations: tools instead of hands, chrome instead of gray matter. The faint fluttering of hearts and eyelids showed that she had intended to continue these “projects.”

Inago’s brow furrowed as Angelino let a metal coated arm drop to the floor. The Suite had destroyed [Zhengqi’s errant tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1e9tm77/), but this junk had been allowed to spark off as Zuantou Rail barrelled forward. Thus the heart of the mountain had been turned into an industrial engine, the brainchild of Vasitanagarh’s premier industrialist. 

Duty had been reduced to obsession, vision reduced to myopia, and the problems of Rākinnagarh to puzzles. Even if it took skimming from Zuantou’s budget, injured hikers and workers could be saved, witnesses repurposed as automata—all for Zhengqi’s dogma.

She never had enough—not enough time, not enough capital, not enough labor, not enough people *recognizing what needed to be done*. So she took it. She would take as much as necessary to show that it would ***work.*** She would have taken and pulled every lever, gripping the wheel, blood leaking from her palms, and shown them that she could fly off the cliff she had hurtled towards.

She would have made her vision by force, and now it had reduced this temple into junk.

There, in the middle of this wreck, sat the [man](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1brwdj2/) who watched it all in silence. His gaze crept across the landscape, across each beam of metal. Arrow shafts, buried in the flesh of Parapollah. A dozen structures unfinished, places to-be encroaching upon a place that had long been. Already, its slopes and ridges were obscured by steel configurations mined from its bones. A horror done to its body.

The man moved his gaze away, to find what remained familiar, to trace the patches that remained pristine. But he could not find the mountain he remembered from a century ago. 

Less snow had fallen this year than the last. Less snow than the year before. 

He had not moved for a day—the cold kept all things still. Instead, his eyes remained fixed on the city below, the gleaming towers, the churning of cars, the people in their day to day. Each one made miniscule by the mountain's scope, the beauty of its form, the power that once flooded the land with fire. 

The power that had destroyed those iron tumors, a display of glorious might that cowed the tiny, teeming mortals down below. But in their malignance, they had grown back.

“What will this one be, I wonder…” his voice was a low, slow scraping, as he looked upon one of the half-made structures. Its foundations were buried like a bullet in his stomach. “Another mountainside estate? A train station? A facility to hollow the veins of Parapollah?”

“Who cares. It’s ruin-ing the view.”

Spanda displayed no shock at the appearance of this voice. Instead he leaned forwards, displaying his chest, his shoulders, his head in turn. There stood Markov, eye gleaming warm as blood.
“Yes, because *that* is what Parapollah is for.” His fingers curled deep into his palms. *“The view.”*

Markov just took in the structures, the city, what snow remained.

“It’s inte-resting. The mountain can be seenfrom anywhere in the City. The City can be-seen n its entirety fromthe mountain.”

Spanda paused. “Indeed. From this vantage point, the city reveals itself.” A hand raised, uncurlIng one finger. “There, for instance. That building has taken on five faces in seven years. They tear out its guts to replace them, and it never lasts. How could mortals ever see the mountain if their sight is so *short?”*

“I’ve heardthat rent is high for retail buildings too.” Markov commented, stepping forth to gesture at the same building with a flick of their finger. A motion of their wrist highlighted the street, a movement of their elbow spanned the block. “They talk aboutit in the Old City.” With a wave of her arm, Markov’s gesture covered all of Rakinnagarh. “It’s quite a lot of noise, you know?.”

“I cannot hear such things from above,” Spanda responded, as the wind scattered that sparse skin of snow.

“Then take my word for it.” Markov leaned into the crevice, eye meeting Spanda’s own, her hair still blown by the breeze.

Slowly, Spanda’s eyes closed shut. But still, he spoke one more question. “That coin that you are bound to, where did its gold come from?”

If he would not look at her, Markov turned with a flourish, gazing at the building he had mentioned. It was a coffee house, now. Perhaps she would visit it some time. Take Rasna, Paranoia, Jim. See what became of it, and all of them. “Does-it-matter?”

“...” Spanda could give no answer. Maybe, maybe not.

Markov stretched, arms raised to the sky, body tensing and untensing with a rhythmic rattle, as if playing along with the wind.

“If you ever come down from the moun-tain, the view reallyis quite nice.”

Markov glanced back at the shadowed contours of his beautiful body, waiting for a response. When she got none, she nodded once, and moved to stride away.

When there was only silence, only wind, only then did Spanda whisper to himself, looking down into the city, wondering if someone else was looking back.

*“Then I hope that you enjoy it.”*

---

From within the iron grave, from underneath Inago’s very fingers a rumble echoed. The mountain used to rumble with Spanda’s fury, but this was different. This was not the voice of a living, breathing ecosystem, fighting to ensure its own eternal containment. This was not a voice at all. It was cold.

To Angelino’s ears, it was the sputtering of a rusted-through engine.

The wail of a hundred corpses, animated one last time. Two hundred eyes opened, able to see once more - some for the first time in years, perhaps, not quite allowed to die but in no way alive.

Given what had been done here, the death of the creator would never be enough to put the creation to rest. Darkness reigned for a moment before a warm, red glow overtook the place. Under this lighting, the blood and oil seemed to disappear, “casts” seeming like normal flesh - looking like they were in life.

Even in her absence, Zhengqi’s will would be carried on, willingly or not, by her victims.

What should have been a minefield sprung up… and stood idle.

Markov and Paranoia found their way to the center of the wreckage, amidst the sparse sea of the dead. It was, peaceful, for a moment. This purpose now fulfilled, activating them was almost akin to freedom.

The serenity did not last, however, as a blast of steam repelled a metallic arm and a flurry of knives sliced through the skin of a leg. Many of the soulless eyes turned towards the intruders—whatever remained of their humanity suborned to Zhengqi’s posthumous directive. 

Yet equally present were those whose eyes betrayed slightly more conscious thought - though disoriented, confused, distracted, whether by time, luck, or will, not every soul here was broken. One such subject found itself as Markov’s next host, Paranoia slinking up and planting the coin on them.

“Hey. Hey Markov.” Paranoia smiled more than a tad wickedly. “You’re not gonna stop me from dicing these guys, right? You’re not gonna go tattle to Brighid or whoever?”

“...It seems-that we. May not be able-to avoid. A confrontation.” Markov’s tone was muted and far more serious than Paranoia was used to. “Though itis not our-mission and. Not what-they deserve. This needs to-be stopped and theyare in our-way.”

Paranoia stared at her companion with something between shock and annoyance. “...When did you get all sappy?”

The Riders, meanwhile, squared next to each other, bracing themselves both physically and mentally. As much hesitation as there was over hurting innocents, it was overwhelmed by a sense of solemn duty. This case, and all the suffering within, needed to be closed for good.

From his shattered sanctum, Spanda watched on—stared down the scourge he was rendered too weak to repel, and the people who had, for their own reasons, resolved to put an end to this last stand of “progress.” An instinct came over him then—he whispered something for his ears only, yet it resounded through the hollow interior of Mount Parapollah.

**”Open the game.”**

---

**Location:** An [abandoned laboratory](https://imgur.com/Ygusqo2) under Mount Parapollah. The map is 50x50m with 2x2 tiles; the brown areas are cave walls and columns, the gray squares are piles of scrap that stack up 4.5 meters high (the ceiling of the cave is 5m high). The big gray square is a large computer that must be dismantled, and the green circles are barrels of flammable chemical waste, which Angelino can consume as fuel.

The stacks of scrap make clear sightlines across the room difficult and leave very little room for ｢Walking Angel｣ or Angelino to fly; clearing them will thus open up the map.

**Goal:** Contribute more to tearing down the lab! Dismantle and move all the scrap and chemical waste to one of the two designated yellow areas at the bottom of the map.

**Additional Information:** There are two types of NPC’s wandering the cavern lab. The ones depicted as blue circles on the map are people Zhengqi has operated on. Needing medical attention, they have 111 Physicals and 2 Cooperative, making them barely strong enough for menial tasks. It is Angelino’s duty to ensure their safety.

The other type of NPC here (not shown on the map) are hostile leftover animatronics, hidden among scrap or stealthily crawling along the cave ceilings. They have C POW, C SPD, D DUR activating whenever a player or injured NPC approaches within 5m (but they are not immediately aggro’d on said NPCs). Alternatively, should players seek out animatronics, they will retaliate in self defense.

Individual animatronics will skirmish with lone entities to cause minor wounds before retreating, waiting for the opportunity for a killing blow. However, given the poor sightlines and their own stealth, they will try to swarm and ambush players, attracted to nearby skirmishes.

Markov’s user, Hàoyú, has 331 Physicals and Construction Worker 4, making him good at navigating around machinery, lifting, and dismantling heavy objects.

Inago has access to ｢Cyclone Effect｣, ｢Tongues of Fire｣, and ｢Walking Angel｣, but not his motorcycle.

Finally I will appreciate any hints and tips regarding places to visit, accomodation, food and getting around your beautiful home island. 

The decision was quite spontaneous, made during our existing travel, but we both wanted to see Tasmania and be close to wombats, and we're standby travellers.

I had a really nasty breakup like just around 7 months ago and lost all of my friends during it. In all fairness, I grew apart from the guys I was friends with in college and got a lot closer with my ex’s friends. When we broke up, it was of little interest to me to make things weird or be a wedge so I removed myself from the picture. In the time that I was spiraling and isolating myself in my depression, I found out that my best guy friend who I had years before this relationship and also knew about the horrible vile things that my ex did to me, not only did not once check on me when I was a breath away from being hospitalized, but was going and hanging out with my ex behind my back after the breakup. Obviously I cut him off because if it was him, I would’ve called. And if it was him and he told me what his ex was doing to him before the breakup, I wouldn’t have been all buddy buddy with her. Cutting him off was an easy decision with hard consequences. That was my last friend. 

I don’t really know what to do now. I’m 24 years old and just kinda…stuck. I live in Metro Detroit, which I’ve seen firsthand and heard from others is absolutely hell for people in their 20s looking to make new friends or have dynamic social lives. I don’t know what the hell to do or where the hell to go that isn’t a 40+ minute drive. Everyone already seems so tight-knit in their own circles and friend groups that I couldn’t possibly hope to make my way in. I’ve gone to clubs and bars and once or twice had the immense luck of meeting someone who I exchanged socials with and said we should hang out sometime, and then when I reach out to follow up, I get ghosted. I couldn’t even manage to make friends with my own coworkers. They’re all friendly with me and I have gone out with some of them once or twice but I’ve reached out before and been ignored and literally been at work while they’re talking about plans that they have and like, no I’m not going to wedge myself into them and make it weird but I’ve lowkey hoped someone would offer to invite me too. Nope. No luck. 

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m not an unpleasant person to be around, at least I don’t think I am. I just genuinely feel like everyone has their circles, their people, their whatever, so why would they want to invite some other random like me into it? And it fucking sucks. 

In terms of hobbies, I go to the gym religiously, I love reading, I love writing, movies, museums, coffee shops, hiking…but it’s like impossible to find someone that likes one of those things that I have literally anything else in common with or have any connection with. Plus they’re such solitary activities that like, I don’t know how I’d even seek these people out beyond luck, of which I have none. 

People my age don’t really go to bars to meet other people from what I can tell. They don’t regularly open their friend groups to friendless new nobodies, and I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

I’m planning on trying to move to either Chicago or New York early next year, and possibly doing some seasonal work in Spain end of next year, so I’m not here tryna find some lifelong fraternity with the men that are gonna stand next to me at my wedding. I just need something either than go to gym, go to work, come home, write, read, maybe write or read in a coffee shop, maybe drive to walk in the woods by myself for a few hours, maybe go to a club in Detroit, barely drink since it’s a 40 min drive but there’s no social activity anywhere else, and kiss some random girls and then drive home. 

I’m just sick of the monotony and I’m *so* sick of the loneliness. I just wish I had someone to talk to. Like I mention in the title, I came so far from the loneliness I felt in high school and I felt like I finally belonged somewhere with someone/people who cared about me. Now I have nothing again. I didn’t want to go back. ",1,1731115390.0,friendship,0,1.0,False

Comecei com essa idéia doida em 2020. Meu amigo tava passando por alguns problemas, e já que eu não tava perto, queria animalo, então jogamos pela primeira vez 100% survival, depois de meses, eu falei brincando em fazer uma cidade. Isso já faz 4 anos... Jogo apenas quando dá tempo, então acho que eu já teria terminado se eu jogasse mais...

Dito isso, me inspirei no Floor 1 de Sword Art Online, e decidi chamar a cidade de ""Arcádia"". 
Alguns amigos me perturbam para postar o que faço. E aqui está.
No momento, estou construindo o interior do Black Iron Palace, que inclusive, tive grandes inspirações a um antigo projeito de SAO que foi cancelado 
(Zekern#0001 & Myshowbro#2508). 

As construções atuais são:
As muralhas
Praça
Praça central
Farm de cana
Leblanc Coffee
Palácio de ferro Negro 

Devo fazer varias coisas ainda, as que eu tenho idéia por agora é;
(Iwatodai Dorm, Paulownia Mall, Mooney's Book, a praça comercial e uma igreja)

É isso, meu amigo me ajuda sempre que dá, com os matérias, eu só boto os bloco, acho que nem seria possível sem ele... Passamos tanta coisa junto lá e sempre iamos fazer essse trabalho escravo rindo muito apesar dos problemas. Eu realmente quero terminar esse mapa. 
Se quiserem acompanhar eu fazendo, posto sempre que começo algo, lá no Twitter [LasanhaEmpanada]

1gmyjem,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gmyjem/methodical_avoidance_on_vyvanse/,Methodical avoidance on Vyvanse ,"I have been taking Vyvanse for almost a year now and as done me a lot of good. However lately I feel it has made me extremely and methodically focused on avoiding all possible forms of human interaction or any potential anxieties. I now order everything online including my groceries, I ask my partner to interact with uber or reception at our unit, I procrastinate to replying to my friends. I really try to leave the house as little as possible and plan around all other interaction.

Maybe I don't get the same level of joy I used to from leaving? I can't exactly say that I'm happy staying home all the time, I'm just very content.
I realised maybe I had a physiological reward system where my ADHD would make me leave the house for an adventure and it would force me to overcome my anxiety by something small like ordering coffee and then give me massive dopamine boost for overcoming it. Vyvanse dulls my anxiety and honesty emotions and now ordering coffee I don't really feel anything, it's a very robotic exhange.

I guess I just miss the ease of leaving the house or the joy from walking down to the store and grabbing a muffin. The impulsion to meet people and get to know more about them. I feel like it was rare for me to find that in other people and I'm going through the motions more. Does anyone have any similar experiences?

2031:

The United States military conducts a drone strike on a major arms deal meeting in Iran. Intelligence, supplied by Israel, showed that numerous high ranking generals would be in attendance. What it didn't show was that the supreme leader Mojtaba Khamenei was also in attendance. His death sparked weeks of mourning in the county. He is succeeded by his son, 24 year old Mohammad Bagher Khamenei, who is determined to avenge his father's death in a show of Iranian strength. A month after the US drone strike, Iran begins a military blockade of the strait of Hormuz, backed by a Houthi blockade of the red sea and Hamas splinter groups launching missiles at the Suez Canal. With the economy in freefall, the Saudi navy attempted to reopen the blockade with force. Iran begins ballistic missile attacks on Saudi cities. Attacks on numerous oil refineries cause the Trans-Arabian Pipeline to begin burning out of control. America withdrew its Naval presence from the South China Sea and deployed them across all points of the blockade, in the East Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. By the grace of Allah, Iran manages to sink the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower days after it was deployed near the Iranian coast, using Russian supplied anti-ship missiles. After this show of weakness, the Chinese military confidently began a multi-front invasion of Taiwan, beginning in December of 2031.

Brazil begins rounding up gang members without trail, declaring Martial law and sending the full force of the military into the most effected communities. Over the next few years, the country rounds up over 550,000 ""criminals"", confining them to expansive and isolated prison camps. The Brazilian government never intended to incarcerate the convicted. Instead, they staged mass executions, mostly by firing squad. The army executes over 500,000 in the space of 5 years, including some as young as 12 years of age. The cartel members who survived and escaped the country flooded into the south, setting their operations up once again mostly in Argentina, in cities like Rosario and Buenos Aires.

My chronic underextraction was due to an uneven tamp. I’d skipped distribution: gently agitating the mound of fresh grounds to make sure it sat flat, without hidden clumps.  

I would tap the portafilter, let gravity do its thing before tamping a 75-80% flat load. The assumption was that freshly ground coffee would be loose enough to even out with tamping. It looked that way. Besides, I’d recorded extraction and examined the puck. There were no problems my beginner eyes could recognise. 

My distribution tool is basic. I use a chopstick with a tapered end. After a casual romp through the hill of grounds and the aforementioned gravity tap, the bed is essentially 100% level with the portafilter lines before tamping, at least to the naked eye.  

Then, I do this thing where I hover over the tamping tool and, with an eye closed, visually center all the circles (tamping tool handle, circumference of portafilter, circular silicone tray) before applying cautiously vertical force.  

Now, pre-infusion begins with 5-6 drops of dark liquid falling at the same time, arrayed in a small tight circle between 1/2-1/3 the diameter of the portafilter. I’ve come to interpret this as a sign of shot decency.  

In contrast, pre-infusion used to produce maybe 1 - 2 reluctant drops. Channeling, likely.  

Going to buy more of the nutty medium dark beans I’d worked through in a bid to compensate for sourness, and go back to trying an off-the-boil sitting infusion.  

Suggestions for getting a fuller, richer cup appreciated.

But he’s my best friend and I rarely see him and if you were thinking why he changed plans last minute, it’s because he’s Dutch and instead of saying “yeah, sorry I have plans with my friend today” he just did that typical Dutch thing of “Oh, im just going to combine both to save time on meeting them at a later date” That’s just how he is. 

But like 10 or 20 minutes into them eating one of the guys turned to me and said “so, what do you do?” I was diagnosed with autism, ADHD (Anxiety related) and multiple personally disorder back in 2015, I’m an extreme introvert and I live alone with a few hobbies and interests. 

I was like oh I just live alone but currently not working, and I just felt this huge cloud of judgement come over me from everybody and they went straight back to talking to my friend and said nothing to me the rest of the time. Like, I know that I don’t do much and I hang out a lot but it’s only when someone says to you “oh what do you do?” That I was like oh shit I actually do nothing and I just feel so useless as a human being.

1gmyanv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gmyanv/location_woes/,Location woes,"Hi. Just want to discuss my situation and outline it all tbh. Got married 3 months ago after dating for 3 years. I was given a job a month before the wedding in a specific location which happens to be my hometown where most of my family live. I am in a career where at a junior level I have no control of where I live, as the location is allocated randomly. My spouse knew this the first time I ever met them and I constantly told them this. We knew for a year before the marriage that I was due to have this random allocation but my spouse always thought I'd go on to do the traditional thing which was to live with them and their family. In reality I was kind of lucky to get allocated my hometown- sure it's not where I thought we'd end up but family is nearby for childcare and I think I need them near me at the moment as I feel like I myself am on the verge of a mental breakdown with all the stress I'm going through at the moment. Alongside this I work a demanding job that has a huge number of out of hours work associated with it so as a couple we agreed that it made sense for my spouse to take on the majority commute. We looked at an in between location but it was just way out of budget to move there.

We put an offer on a house a month after the wedding in my hometown and since then we've had continual arguments to the point where it's all become too much for me. 

My spouse does an hour commute at the moment but this is going to go up to 1.5 hours and they are really worried about that. They keep telling me that they are moving to my city and that they feel like a guest in this city and that it will never be home to them. Throughout the entire homebuying process they have repeatedly tried to call things off one day and then agree to proceed with the purchase later. They've told me their depression is getting worse at the thought of moving and that they're anticipating gping back on antidepressants throughout the entire time they will live in this area. They tell me they're giving up their whole life to make this move (but with this move they will still be commuting to their workplace which is in their hometown 3 days a week, so not totally moving away). Spouse likes to walk and go to coffee shops but it is about a 25 minute walk to a coffee shop from the house which they're not happy with, however the location of the house was picked. They don't have much of a social network back home - the pull factor is that work and gym are there as well as their mother. They've stated to the mother that they just wanted to live in their current house forever. 

To complicate matters further the MIL has got involved and made statements to my spouse saying its not fair that you're moving to the in laws and not staying with us, the training contract is for 3 years and then you must move back, your in laws will take all your money etc, she has gossiped to other relatives in their family saying that my family are controlling which isnt true and this is all causing me to be very stressed and panicky within myself. I don't feel settled and contented in the marriage and I feel stressed and pressurised. The MIL has tried to control a few things and ive found her dictating to me what bed size I should buy, disagreeing with some of my decor ideas for the home etc, disagreeing with a religious tradition that I want to do as a house warming thing etc and it's griding me down. The MIL told my spouse they need to count down every month of the next 3 years until they move back home. 

Originally the plan was to stay for 3 years for my training contract and then move to the area where my spouse is from but given the issues with the MIL and severe lack of support I feel, I am genuinely worried for my mental health and that I will have a nervous breakdown if I make the move there. I feel that she's only looking at her self interests and a major point of us staying in the area I'm currently based in is that we woukd have free childcare from my family which we would not have to the same degree in my spouses hometown. 

I think ultimately what bothers me is ho I deal with my spouse at the moment with this move whilst protecting my own mental health..  I have no known me tal health illness at the moment but the marriage is hugely stressful and I don't feel at all like a loved up newly wed. I feel so stuck and so lost and part of me feels guilty for my partner having to move this way but then I also feel that they're struggling to commit to me. I don't know whether my whole perspective is warped? 

Can anyone suggest anything I can try to try and make the current move or things easier with my spouse because I feel like it's got to a point where I'm really really down about the whole marriage? Can anyone also suggest what i can do to make the marriage better - i dont know if this is a temporary blip im reaction to my spouse makkng a major life change or whether we were incompatible with each other and should not have got married in the first place. With everything going on i just have severe doubts about whether we can survive and the repeated arguments where my spouse then brings their mother into it all is really stressful. This isn't my idea of marriage and my spouses constant stress is making me doubt their commitment but at the same time I know I have to be understanding since they are making a massive sacrifice.

Immensely grateful for her and this subreddit for you kind suggestions!,"In a previous post, I 24M wanted to ask for suggestions from you guys for my GF 21F because she's been having a tough time at work.. There's been immense bullying, inappropiate comments and blackmail of termination to the group of interns. She's just been low in confidence for the last 3 days. I couldn't do much about it because I was in the office the last 3 days, I could only console her for 40 minutes during my lunchbreaks. She's been crying at work and I felt bad I couldn't do anything about it.

Now that life has returned back to normalcy for me where I can work from home. With your guys kind suggestions, I sent her this present on Friday, its not much its flowers, chocolates, a teddy bear and a motivational letter. Funnily enough her gift got delivered at a coffee shop where they had a meeting with a manager discussing about the incidents and she said ""Its beautiful that you have a support system"". 

She posted my gift on her IG story yesterday and I couldn't be more grateful for her and you guys for suggesting some ideas.. I'm off to see her in 5 weeks time, gonna be the best 33 days of my life. Again guys thank you so much for your suggestions on cheering her up.",9,1731114115.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

My husband works evenings so it’s just me for dinner, bath, and bedtime. She’s also entered the phase where it’s really funny when I say “no” or raise my voice (usually only when she’s doing something dangerous). 

How do you do it and still feel like a good mom? I hate getting so frustrated with her or putting on the tv out of desperation to get a breather. I hate feeling anxious on my way home, worrying that I’m already counting down the minutes to bedtime (daylight savings doesn’t help since it’s dark by 5pm now). I feel like a shit mom and idk how to fix it.

Any advice will help, I’m burnt to a crisp.

(Also please don’t suggest more caffeine, I’m super sensitive to it and anything more than my one morning cup of coffee just makes me more anxious and irritable)

I have done this many times and the process usually takes between 2-4 days from request to having the item unlocked for your account. After filling out the form you'll receive a message from Bethesda support verifying which item you've selected and telling you how many Atoms it will cost and ask you to verify that you've got enough to cover the purchase. Just reply to that and you're done.

1gmy1j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Revigorator/comments/1gmy1j7/aging_benefits_on_national_cappuccino_day/,Aging Benefits on National Cappuccino Day,"New research highlights a fascinating potential in coffee: supporting healthy aging. Coffee has often been enjoyed for its energizing effects, but scientists are now finding that moderate coffee consumption may benefit cellular health. The antioxidants in coffee, particularly chlorogenic acids, help reduce oxidative stress—a known contributor to aging—by neutralizing free radicals that damage cells over time. This effect has sparked interest in coffee as a tool for preserving biological youth.

The relationship between coffee and cellular health extends to cardiometabolic benefits. Studies have noted that regular coffee drinkers may face a lower risk of diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, conditions frequently associated with aging. Researchers suggest that these benefits may stem from coffee’s impact on NAD+ levels, an essential compound for cellular repair and energy. As NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, coffee might help maintain them, enhancing cell resilience.

However, coffee’s effects are not universally positive. High doses of caffeine could potentially increase gut permeability, leading to inflammation in some cases. Fortunately, research suggests that moderate coffee consumption does not pose this risk for most individuals. Instead, moderate coffee intake may support a balanced gut microbiome, a key player in maintaining long-term health.

It’s essential to note that moderation is critical to achieving these benefits. Excessive caffeine intake can have negative side effects, from jitteriness to sleep disturbances, which can indirectly affect healthspan. But when enjoyed in reasonable amounts, coffee shows promising links to cellular health, longevity, and a reduced risk of aging-related diseases.

For those who appreciate their morning coffee ritual, there’s even more reason to enjoy it mindfully. Science suggests that the right amount of coffee might offer benefits that go beyond energy—potentially supporting a healthier, longer life.",1,1731113509.0,Revigorator,0,1.0,False

1gmxzby,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxScientific/comments/1gmxzby/national_cappuccino_day_moderate_coffee/,National Cappuccino Day: Moderate Coffee Consumption Can Promote Your Longevity,"Coffee has long been a part of our daily rituals, but recent research suggests that it may play an unexpected role in the aging process. Studies are now exploring how moderate coffee consumption can impact biological age, a concept that measures health on a cellular level rather than by chronological years. Findings from various studies show that regular coffee drinkers may experience a slower progression of biological aging, potentially due to coffee’s antioxidant content and its ability to support cellular health. This shift from seeing coffee solely as an energizer to viewing it as a potential tool for longevity is gaining traction in scientific circles.

The active compounds in coffee, especially antioxidants like chlorogenic acids, are believed to combat oxidative stress, a key factor in aging. Oxidative stress occurs when the body’s cells are damaged by free radicals, and these antioxidants help neutralize that damage. By reducing oxidative stress, coffee may support cellular resilience, which is essential for healthy aging. Studies using biomarkers to measure biological age show that regular, moderate coffee consumption correlates with younger cellular profiles, which aligns with the observed health benefits in coffee drinkers.

But coffee’s benefits aren’t limited to antioxidants alone. Research also points to coffee’s influence on cardiometabolic health, particularly in reducing the risk of conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. These effects are linked to coffee’s impact on NAD+ levels, a compound critical for cellular energy and repair. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, but coffee appears to help support these levels, thereby enhancing cellular functions that maintain healthspan. This cellular boost may partially explain the longevity benefits observed in coffee drinkers.

Of course, coffee is not without controversy in health discussions. Some researchers argue that coffee can increase gut permeability, which could lead to inflammation. However, this effect is generally observed with high caffeine intake rather than moderate consumption. Most studies indicate that when consumed in moderation, coffee does not negatively impact gut health and may even promote a balanced microbiome. The key takeaway from these studies is that moderate coffee drinking seems to deliver health benefits without the downsides associated with excessive caffeine.

Ultimately, coffee appears to offer more than just a morning energy boost. When consumed in moderation, it supports cellular health, reduces the risk of age-related diseases, and may even help slow down the biological aging process. While there are still areas needing more research, coffee remains a fascinating area of study in the field of aging. For those who savor their morning cup, it’s intriguing to consider that it could be doing more for their health than they realize.",1,1731113328.0,MaxScientific,0,1.0,False

Comecei com essa idéia doida em 2020. Meu amigo tava passando por alguns problemas, e já que eu não tava perto, queria animalo, então jogamos pela primeira vez 100% survival, depois de meses, eu falei brincando em fazer uma cidade. Isso já faz 4 anos... Jogo apenas quando dá tempo, então acho que eu já teria terminado se eu jogasse mais...

Dito isso, me inspirei no Floor 1 de Sword Art Online, e decidi chamar a cidade de ""Arcádia"". 
Alguns amigos me perturbam para postar o que faço. E aqui está.
No momento, estou construindo o interior do Black Iron Palace, que inclusive, tive grandes inspirações a um antigo projeito de SAO que foi cancelado 
(Zekern#0001 & Myshowbro#2508). 

As construções atuais são:
As muralhas
Praça
Praça central
Farm de cana
Leblanc Coffee
Palácio de ferro Negro 

Devo fazer varias coisas ainda, as que eu tenho idéia por agora é;
(Iwatodai Dorm, Paulownia Mall, Mooney's Book, a praça comercial e uma igreja)

É isso, meu amigo me ajuda sempre que dá, com os matérias, eu só boto os bloco, acho que nem seria possível sem ele... Passamos tanta coisa junto lá e sempre iamos fazer essse trabalho escravo rindo muito apesar dos problemas. Eu realmente quero terminar esse mapa. 
Se quiserem acompanhar eu fazendo, posto sempre que começo algo, lá no Twitter [LasanhaEmpanada]

Grinders: Timemore 078s with turbo burrs  for pourovers , Lagom 01 or P64 for espresso (have yet to decide).

Water
I will run the water through a calcite filter cartridge prior going to the machine. The machine will come with a 3/8” compression fitting. I need to get a 3/8” pressure reducer w/ a gauge. I will need to be at 1-2bar. So the water will run from the current whole house carbon filter and water softening set up to the calcite filter then an inline TDS monitor (TDS should hopefully read 80-130, ideally 90-110). Hot and cold pex ran to the sink (not through the calcite filter, just off the house setup).

Drains
Espresso machine needs a drain as does the sink.

Electric
Service will need (2) 15amp breakers or a 30:
- espresso machine: 11amp
- kettle: 10amp
- grinders: 2.5-8amp (variable)

I would like an outlet behind the grinder station. But I want a hole in the counter top so that a flat power strip could be ran to the top inside of the cabinet - so essentially all cords are hidden underneath the counter and no cords are on the countertop (cords behind the espresso machine won’t be seen). To the right of the machine needs to be a single outlet and two switches, one for the overhead lights and one for under shelving LED.

Shelving
Two shelves will go the full span on both walls and will be 9” wide and be made out of hickory to match the beam. 

Countertop
See the diagram, should be about 42 1/4” x 25” then 41” x 18” white quartz to match the kitchen. 

Cabinets: white, matching kitchen, with base cabinet and drawer. Backsplash will be glass tile.


TLDR: take a look at the equipment placement and the layout. This is the only layout that made sense to me for workflow and space have space to prep. Grind and prep on the left, brew in the corner , sink on the right, ECM steam wand is on the left. Can you think of a better way to organize this? Would you do it differently? Why?

We setup a small office where we provide snacks and coffee, they are well compensated at hindi rin naman kami mahigpit kasi ayaw ko din ng mina-micromanage ako.

But the problem is parang ang layo nila sa amin. These 3 employees namin ay kasamahan namin sa church before(me and my husband stopped going to church due to toxicity) di naman kami closed nung nagch-church pa kami pero di rin naman kami strangers. They are in the mid 20’s pero parang mga di adults. If they want/need something di magsasalita kelangan ko pa tanungin. For example, napalakas ung aircon, kahit nanginginig na sa lamig di magsasalita, kelangan ko pang tanungin kung gusto nila na hinaan ko.(though pwede naman nila hinaan kasi I always tell them na free sila gumalaw sa office). I already communicated na ang gusto ko proactive silang magsabi kasi ayoko ng nanghuhula kung ano gusto nila. Everyday before I come in sa office(sila lang) the vibe is good, may tawanan, chikahan pero kapag pumasok na ako biglang tahimik, kahit di ko naman pinagbabawalan na mag-ingay.. 

Di kami sabay sabay pumapasok,, nauuna ung mga employees namin, after a few hours pumapasok ako at sa umaga na pumapasok husband ko, so mas marami akong time na kasama sila kesa sa husband ko.

Another thing, since nagwfh ako, nawalan na ako ng nakakachikahan na friends. I want someone na nakakasharean ko ng everyday ganap ko sa buhay, ng thoughts ko, alam nyo un? Lagi na lang kasi husband ko kausap ko(which I am very thankful) pero since araw araw ko sila kasama baka naman pwede ko silang kachikahan while working pero whenever nagsheshare ako, nagbibitaw ng joke, responsive naman sila pero un na un, di narereciprocate. Ako lang ung may gustong makipagcommunicate, I usually ask them naman about ganap nila sa buhay pero kung anong tanong un lang ang sagot. 

Hindi ako extrovert pero I tried my best naman para kunin ung loob nila pero parang hanggang  dito na lang siguro ako.

Maybe they just dont like me, okay lang naman kasi may mga taong ayaw ko din, not because they’re bad pero di lang kami same vibes. Pero nakakalungkot lang, may kasama nga ako sa office pero parang mag-isa lang din ako.

I slept like a baby and I got to spend all day writing and painting in my office. I could stew in the guilt I feel for feeling good when I know so many are suffering but I simply don't want to. Me making myself mentally suffer alongside them helps no one. All I can do is keep moving forward.

Anyway, my stomach has also been better. I've eating a full lunch and dinner with no issue. I even had it in me to daydream again. I went upstairs to my office after lunch and got to work. Oh, it is glorious up there. It is clean, everything has a place, I can move around and reach whatever I need to reach. My laptop works so much better for writing than my older desktop; my documents don't freeze or buffer. I am relatively alone so I can focus. Occasionally my parents pop in to speak to me but there isn't a constant coming and going in the corner of my eye that gets so frustrating. It was just peaceful. More than anything, what I need right now is peace.

I wrote 706 words. It's been a long time since i'm managed more than 400, hasn't it? It wasn't always easy, but having that space really helped to power through whatever blocks I stumbled into. When I needed a break, I traded my writing for painting. I worked on the oyster for about an hour. The oysters is supposed to be all in shades of blue so I thought I ruined it when I decided to throw some black and purple in for some reason. Soon I figured that wasn't working and switched back to the colour scheme I was working on the day before and it is looking good I think. Very Georgia O'Keeffe if she painting sea life in stead of flowers. Tomorrow, I think I'll highlight with some white, do an outline, and add the pearl. Then the oyster will be done and I'll have to figure out how to paint the tentacles; I am very nervous about that part.

Now, I am back downstairs, relaxing for the night. It has been so long since I felt accomplished enough to just relax for the night. I have a little birthday cake left in the fridge. I think I'll have some of that with my evening coffee. I'm going to treat myself well tonight.
