Tekstisein√§ tulossa :D


Ensimm√§isen√§ mun on t√§ytyy varoittaa teille, ett√§ t√§√§ vois kuuluu v√§h√§n oudolta. Ei vaan siksi, ett√§ m√§ opin suomen kielt√§ kattomalla youtube videoita, lukemalla youtube kommenteit√§ ja k√§√§nt√§m√§ll√§ suomen musiikka ja sen takia kirjoitan kun simpanssi... Vaan my√∂s siksi, ett√§ mit√§ m√§ sanon vois olla vaikeatajuinen monille teist√§.


Te tied√§tte varmasti ihmisi√§ joita kattoo animej√§ ja v√§hitellen alkaa rakastaa kaikesta japalainen kielest√§ ja kultturista jne, vaikkei ne ees ollu japanissa eik√§ niill√§ on japalaisia kavereita. M√§ en koskaan oikeastaan ymm√§rt√§nyt n√§it√§ ihmisi√§ ja luulin ett√§ ne on v√§h√§n oudolta (ja m√§ viel√§kin luulen sit√§ lol).


Mut siis joo √∂√∂√∂√∂√∂√∂√∂√∂ nyt se noloo juttu on, ett√§ mun on pakko my√∂nt√§√§, ett√§ m√§ oon yks niist√§. Paitsi m√§ en oo rakastunut Japaniin, vaan m√§ oon rakastunut Suomeen. Ja m√§ halusin kertoo teille koska mulla ei oo joku toisen jonka m√§ voisin tai haluisin kertoo sen.


Ensinn√§kin m√§ haluun sanoo ett√§ m√§ ihan todella vitun saakelin rakastan teid√§n suomen kielt√§. M√§ tii√§n ett√§ mun suomi ehk√§ n√§ytt√§√§ v√§h√§n kun kumalassa eestil√§inen joka yritt√§√§ kirjoittaa suomeks. Kun m√§ sanoin ennen, m√§ opin suomea katsomisesta youtube vlogeist√§ ja muista videoista sek√§ niiden kommenteist√§ koska m√§ rehellisesti ihan vihan kielikirjoja ja mit√§ ja miten niit√§ opettaa. M√§ en haluu oppia miten kysyy ""Where is the hotel? Can I have a coffee please?"" koska m√§ en haluu olla turisti, vaan ymm√§rr√§ te oikeita suomalaisia ihmisi√§ ja teid√§n huumori ja kultturi.


En oikeesti muista miks m√§ tuolloin aloitin oppia suomea. Vaan muistan ett√§ 2011 m√§ ostin kielikirjaa, luin viis sivuja, sitten sanoin itelleni ""fuck this shit"" ja en en√§√§ kosketin oppia suomea 2023n asti. Sit t√§n vuoden kes√§n√§ m√§ yht√§kki√§ p√§√§t√§n ett√§ nyt m√§ vihdoinkin todellisesti aion oppia suomen kielt√§. Siis nyt melkein 2 vuosia my√∂hemmin, t√§ss√§ m√§ oon. Kirjoitan kurjaa suomea k√§yt√§m√§ll√§ sanakirjaa **mut perkele m√§ osaan kirjoittaa ja ymm√§rr√§ v√§h√§n vitun SUOMEA.**


Varmaankin te muistatte kun te opitte englantia ja l√∂ysitte englantikielinen maailman. Englantilainen sarjat, elokuvat, videot, meemit jne. Nyt mulla on t√§sm√§lleen t√§n tunne suomen kielen kanssa. On ihan mahtava kattoa ja ymm√§rr√§ suomenkielen juttuja. M√§ muistan kun m√§ katoin ekaa kertaa suomenkielen videon youtubessa (Soikku ‚ù§) ja kun m√§ en ymm√§rtynyt yht√§√§n kun ""moi kaikki"" ja ""moi moi"". :D Nyky√§√§n m√§ osaan kattoo ja ymm√§rt√§√§ esim Luottomiest√§ tekstityksill√§, muutamat tubettajat m√§ osaan ymm√§rt√§√§ jopa ilman tekstityksill√§, joka on IHAN HULLU. Joskus m√§ ymm√§rr√§n 90%, joskus m√§ ymm√§rr√§n... *√§tt√§rr√§ suvulta turrulta vautama ykk√∂st√§ m√§ks√§t√§ paartamaan her√§lt√§√§n*, eli ei vitun mit√§√§n. üòÇ Sit m√§ mietin, oonks m√§ oppinu v√§√§rin suomen kielen vai olikohan t√§√§ ehk√§ savolainen?


Anyway, nyt en oikeesti tii√§ mihin m√§ meen t√§st√§ kohdasta. Niinku m√§ jo sanoin, m√§ en asuu suomessa eik√§ mulla oo suomalaisia yst√§vi√§, joten suomen kielen oppiminen on tosi hitaasti mulle. Oon miettinyt oppia suomea kieliopettajan kanssa, koska m√§ tietysti haluun osaa *puhuu* suomea. Mulla on t√§mm√∂nen tyhma ajatus ett√§ mun t√§ytyy osaa suomi ennen ku m√§ tuun Suomeen ekaa kertaa lomalle.


M√§ toivon ett√§ ehk√§ 2026 talvella tai kev√§ll√§ m√§ vihdoin voin matkustaa Suomeen (on v√§h√§n vaikea juttu mulle koska asun yksin ja mulla on kissa [*Kissanvero t√§√§ll√§* ü•∞](https://imgur.com/a/QCYolhv) ). Ensiksi menisin todenn√§k√∂isesti Helsinkiin yks tai kaks viikkoa. Sit jos m√§ todellakin tykk√§√§n Helsingist√§/Suomesta, m√§ haluisin tulla useampi ja ehk√§ autolla ja SITTEN mulla ois isoja suunnitelmia. M√§ matkustaisin ymp√§ri koko Suomeen, vierailisin Suomen pienien ja isojen kaupungit mitk√§ m√§ n√§in videoissa, esim Tampere, Jyv√§skyl√§, Oulu, Rovaniemi, Kouvola :D jne. M√§ katoisin j√§rvi√§, jokia, puutia, laskeisin poroja üòÖs√∂isin ja joisin kaikki suomalainen ruokaa (saksalainen vaatimaton ruoka ü§ù suomalainen vaatimaton ruoka), kuolla itikkojen takia jne. Ehk√§ lataa tinderia, siin√§ tehd√§ vaikutus johonkuhun s√∂p√∂√∂n suomalaiseen naiseen mun sikan suomenkielen skilleilla, sitten saada sen n√§ytt√§√§ mulle Suomen parhaiden paikkojen/juttujen, eli vaan matkustaa jonkun toisen kaa. üòä


Siis toistaiseksi m√§ jatkan opiskelemasta suomea, kattomasta suomenkielen videoita ja lukemasta /r/arkisuomi (ihan hieno subreddit btw). Ehk√§ silloin t√§lloin m√§ voisin kirjoittaa kommenti t√§√§ll√§ kun saksa on aihe.


Anyway kiitos kun luitte t√§nne asti. üòä Jos joku haluu juttelee mun kaa, voit laittaa mun viesti suomeks, englanniks tai saksaks DM:een.


Hyv√§√§ viikonloppujatkoa ja moimoi! üòä",1,1747476591.0,Suomi,0,1.0,False

1kopjh0,https://v.redd.it/cgps4348gb1f1,Need help diagnosing reason for channeling [Quick Mill 3035/Quick Mill 3035],"Sooo I need a little help with a diagnosing a channeling problem



About a year ago my wife and I where able to rescue an Italian espresso machine (Quick Mill 3035) which was about to be thrown away after about 2year of use ander after a good clean and maintenance it worked perfectly.



Dailing it in however, has been quite the journey.¬†



Shots have always ran quick, 10seconds at 9bar for 14grams in, 28 grams out and have consequently tasted underextracted. I switch to grinding finer and doing the same ratio in 20seconds, which is a bit better.



After buying a bottomless portfilter it has come to my attention that channeling was likely to be the culprit.

Since then I have tried to:

\- Up my puck prep (mainly let the grounds rest for 10 minutes to get rid of static, can't single dose in grinder so no RDT, did very little. Focussing on more thorough distribution helped a tiny bit.)

\- Grind finer (worse and maxed out pump)¬†

\- Grind courser (slightly better but ran like Usain bolt)

\- lowered temperature (did nothing)¬†



The beans used are a medium roast blend from a nearby coffee shop and when they use the blend they get really nice shots!¬†



I'm almost at loss here, don't really know what to try anymore.

(Part 1 )","I don't know who needs to hear this, but stay away from Kwik Trip #483 in Hallock, Minnesota.

You've probably seen the news by now. Three employees found unconscious in the walk-in freezer last month, eyes wide open, skin blue as winter sky, but still breathing. The fourth one‚ÄîTony Gustafson‚Äîvanished without a trace. The security footage showed him walking into the bathroom at 3:17 AM and never coming out. The authorities called it an ""unexplained workplace incident"" and blamed it on carbon monoxide poisoning, but I know better.

I know because I was Tony's replacement.

My name is Finn Larson. Six weeks ago, I was just another broke college dropout with mounting debt and a reputation for quitting jobs as soon as I started them. My parents had finally cut me off after I bailed on my third attempt at community college, so I packed everything I owned into my beat-up Chevy Impala and headed north to stay with my uncle in Kittson County.

Hallock is one of those towns where everybody knows everybody, where gossip travels faster than internet service, and where the winter wind cuts through your clothes like they're made of tissue paper. Population 981, and most of them have lived here their entire lives. The only reason anyone ever stops in Hallock is to gas up before crossing into Canada or to buy cheap cigarettes at the reservation twenty miles east.

Uncle Lars didn't ask questions when I showed up at his doorstep. He just nodded, showed me to the spare room above his garage, and told me I could stay as long as I contributed. By ""contribute,"" he meant get a job and help with bills.

""Kwik Trip's hiring,"" he mentioned over dinner my second night there. ""They're desperate after what happened.""

I'd seen the headline on my drive in‚Äîsomething about employees hospitalized‚Äîbut hadn't paid much attention. Small-town news rarely interested me.

""What exactly happened there?"" I asked between bites of his surprisingly good Swedish meatballs.

Uncle Lars shrugged. ""Nobody's quite sure. Four night shift workers had some kind of episode. Three are in the hospital up in Grand Forks. Fourth one just up and disappeared."" He leaned forward, lowering his voice despite us being alone in the house. ""Marlene at the diner says they found weird symbols scratched into the freezer walls. Like someone was trying to keep something in‚Äîor out.""

I laughed. ""Sounds like small-town superstition to me.""

""Maybe so."" He took a swig of his beer. ""But they're offering twenty-two dollars an hour for the overnight shift. Nobody local will take it.""

That caught my attention. Twenty-two an hour was nearly double minimum wage. I could save up enough to get my own place in a couple months at that rate.

The next morning, I drove to Kwik Trip #483. It sat alone on Highway 75, just at the edge of town, its red and white sign like a beacon against the flat, snow-dusted farmland stretching in every direction. The store itself was newer than I expected‚Äîall glass and gleaming surfaces‚Äîbut something about it seemed wrong, like a smile that doesn't reach the eyes.

The manager, Patricia Olsen, hired me on the spot. She was a heavyset woman in her fifties with bleached blonde hair and deep lines around her mouth from years of smoking.

""Night shift, 10 PM to 6 AM,"" she said, sliding the paperwork across her desk. ""You'll be alone most nights. That gonna be a problem?""

""No ma'am,"" I replied, signing the forms without reading them. ""I prefer working alone.""

She nodded, but her eyes darted away. ""There are some.. procedures we follow here at night. Special rules. Nothing complicated, just store policy.""

""Rules?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

Patricia reached into her desk drawer and pulled out a laminated sheet of paper. ""Just follow these, and everything will be fine."" She handed it to me, and I felt a strange weight to the paper, like it was made of something denser than it should have been.

I glanced down at the list. Ten numbered items, typed in a simple font. They seemed odd‚Äîspecific times to check certain areas, items that couldn't be sold after midnight, instructions about the bathroom and the coffee machines.

""These seem.. unusual,"" I said.

Patricia's face tightened. ""Every Kwik Trip has its quirks. This location just has a few more than most."" She stood up abruptly. ""Your shift starts tonight. Don't be late.""

As I walked out to my car, I noticed something on the roof of the building. A small black object, like a carved figurine, perched above the entrance. I squinted, trying to make out what it was, but the sun caught my eyes. When I looked again, it was gone.

I didn't think much of it at the time. I should have run then and never looked back.

Little did I know that Kwik Trip #483 wasn't just a gas station. It was a threshold, and I had just agreed to become its keeper.

Uncle Lars raised his eyebrows when I told him I'd been hired for the night shift.

""You sure about that, Finn? After what happened to those folks?""

I shrugged, scrolling through my phone. ""Twenty-two an hour to stand around and sell snacks? I'd work in a morgue for that kind of money.""

He didn't laugh. ""Just be careful. This town might seem boring, but."" He trailed off, focusing on his crossword puzzle.

""But what?""

""Nothing."" He folded his newspaper. ""Some places just have history, that's all.""

I arrived at Kwik Trip at 9:45 PM for my first shift. The evening clerk, a college-aged girl named Jenny, barely acknowledged me as she counted down her register.

""You're the new guy, huh?"" She didn't look up from the bills. ""Good luck.""

""Thanks,"" I replied, setting my backpack down behind the counter. ""Any tips for the overnight?""

Jenny finally met my eyes, her expression flat. ""Just follow the rules.""

""Those weird instructions Patricia gave me? Are they for real?""

Jenny zipped her bag closed with unnecessary force. ""I wouldn't know. I leave before ten."" She headed toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and don't go into the storage room unless you absolutely have to.""

""Why not?""

""It smells weird. Like, really weird."" She was gone before I could ask anything else.

The first hour passed uneventfully. I stocked coolers, wiped down counters, and helped the occasional customer buying gas or late-night snacks. By 11 PM, the store was empty, and the world outside had gone dark and still. The only sounds were the quiet hum of refrigerators and the soft tick of the clock behind the counter.

I pulled out the laminated rule sheet Patricia had given me:

At 11:30 PM, lock the bathroom door and place the ""Out of Order"" sign. Do NOT remove this sign until 5 AM.
The coffee machines must be unplugged at exactly midnight. Do not plug them back in until 4:13 AM.
If the phone rings between 1 AM and 3 AM, allow it to ring exactly three times, then answer. Say only, ""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?"" If you hear nothing but breathing, hang up immediately.
The walk-in freezer must remain closed between 2 AM and 4 AM. No exceptions.
If you see a customer wearing a red scarf, do not make eye contact. Complete their transaction quickly and do not engage in conversation.
Do not sell milk after 1 AM.
If a stray dog appears at the window, draw the blinds and remain at the register until it leaves.
At 3:33 AM, face the security camera in the northeast corner and count backward from ten. Do this even if you think no one is watching.
The chips in aisle three sometimes fall off the shelves. Return them only using the tongs kept behind the counter.
If you notice the bathroom door is open at any point during your shift, despite having locked it, close the store immediately and leave the premises. Do not return until sunrise.

I snorted. This had to be some kind of hazing ritual for new employees. Probably Jenny or Patricia would be watching the security footage, laughing at me following these ridiculous instructions.

Still, twenty-two dollars an hour to play along with their game? Easy money.

At 11:30, I dutifully locked the bathroom and hung the ""Out of Order"" sign. No big deal‚Äîmost nights we probably didn't get many customers who needed it anyway.

At midnight, I unplugged the coffee machines. That one actually made me feel bad‚Äîwhat if a trucker came in wanting coffee? But rules were rules, even stupid ones.

Around 12:45 AM, a man in a John Deere cap entered, nodding silently at me before browsing the snack aisle. He brought a bag of chips and a Mountain Dew to the counter.

As I rang him up, he glanced at the dark coffee machines.

""No coffee tonight?""

""Machines are down,"" I said, bagging his items. ""Sorry about that.""

He frowned. ""That's odd. I stop here every Tuesday night on my way back from Roseau. Always get the same cup of French roast.""

I hadn't realized it was Tuesday. Had Patricia known this regular customer would come in? Was this some kind of test?

""Sorry,"" I repeated. ""Maybe try the diner down the street?""

He shook his head. ""Nah, they close at midnight."" He took his bag and headed to the door, then stopped and turned. ""You're new.""

""First night,"" I confirmed.

""They tell you about the rules?""

My hand instinctively touched the laminated sheet in my pocket. ""Yeah.""

He nodded. ""Follow them."" Then he was gone.

At 1:17 AM, the phone rang. I jumped, nearly dropping the energy drink I'd been sipping to stay awake. I counted‚Äîone ring, two rings, three‚Äîthen picked up.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

Silence, then soft breathing. The hairs on my arms stood up.

I slammed the phone down, heart racing. Coincidence. It had to be. Someone with a wrong number or a bored teenager making prank calls.

At 2 AM, I did a quick walkthrough of the store, making sure everything was in order. All quiet, except‚Äî

A bag of chips had fallen from its rack in aisle three.

I froze, staring at the bright yellow package on the floor. Hadn't I just straightened that display an hour ago?

I remembered rule number nine. This was ridiculous. I started to bend down to pick it up, then hesitated. What if someone was watching? I didn't want to lose this job over something so stupid.

With a frustrated sigh, I went behind the counter and found the tongs‚Äîactual metal barbecue tongs‚Äîexactly where the rules said they'd be. Using them, I picked up the chip bag and placed it back on the shelf, feeling utterly foolish.

As I turned to go back to the counter, I heard a soft scratching noise from the direction of the bathroom. Like fingernails on the door.

I stopped breathing. The sound came again‚Äîscratch, scratch, scratch.

Slowly, I walked to the front of the store and looked down the hallway toward the restrooms. The ""Out of Order"" sign hung undisturbed. The door remained closed.

But as I watched, the handle jiggled slightly.

I backed away, nearly tripping over my own feet. This wasn't funny anymore. Someone was messing with me.

""Hello?"" I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Is someone there?""

The handle stopped moving. The silence felt heavier than before.

I returned to the register, keeping my eyes on the bathroom door. Nothing happened for the rest of the hour, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting just on the other side.

At 3:33 AM, I faced the northeast security camera as instructed and counted backward from ten, feeling like an absolute idiot. As I finished, the lights throughout the store flickered once, then steadied.

Probably just a power surge. It didn't mean anything.

By the time my shift ended at 6 AM, I'd convinced myself that everything unusual had been the product of an overactive imagination fueled by energy drinks and small-town ghost stories.

The morning clerk, an older man named Harold, arrived precisely on time. His eyebrows rose when he saw me.

""You made it,"" he said, sounding genuinely surprised.

""Was there any doubt?""

Harold merely shrugged, but the relief in his face was unmistakable.

As I walked to my car in the pale morning light, I looked back at the store. For a moment, I thought I saw a dark figure in the window‚Äîtall and thin, watching me leave.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I slept poorly that day, dreams filled with ringing phones and scratching sounds. When I finally gave up and dragged myself out of bed around four in the afternoon, Uncle Lars was at the kitchen table cleaning his hunting rifle.

""How was the first night?"" he asked, not looking up from his task.

""Quiet,"" I lied. No need to admit I'd been spooked by some silly rules and my own imagination. ""Boring, actually.""

""Hm."" He worked a cloth down the barrel with practiced hands. ""Olsons stopped by while you were sleeping.""

""Olsons?""

""Sven and Maggie. They own the farm up the road."" He paused. ""Wanted to know if you were the new night clerk at the Kwik Trip.""

Something about his tone made me uneasy. ""Word travels fast.""

""Small town."" He finally looked up. ""They lost their son Erik there.""

I frowned. ""At the Kwik Trip? What happened?""

""He was the night manager before Patricia. About five years back. Went missing during his shift."" Lars reassembled the rifle with quick movements. ""Security footage showed him walking into that storage room and never coming out.""

My mouth went dry. ""They never found him?""

Lars shook his head. ""County sheriff searched the whole building. Nothing. Place was locked from the inside."" He stood up, storing the rifle in its case. ""Just thought you should know.""

On my drive to work that evening, I took a detour past the Kittson County Historical Society‚Äîreally just a small building next to the library. A woman with gray hair pulled into a tight bun was locking up.

""Excuse me,"" I called, rolling down my window. ""Do you know anything about the history of the Kwik Trip on Highway 75?""

She turned slowly, keys still in hand. ""Why do you ask?""

""I work there,"" I said. ""Just curious about the building.""

Her expression shifted. ""That plot of land used to belong to the Svenson family. They were..unusual people.""

""Unusual how?""

She glanced at her watch. ""I need to go. But."" She hesitated, then walked over to my car. ""That gas station sits on what used to be their root cellar. Lars Svenson‚Äîno relation to your uncle‚Äîwas found there in 1931. They said he'd been keeping things down there.""

""Things?""

""Not things you'd want to find in a normal cellar."" She stepped back. ""If I were you, I'd find another job.""

I arrived at the Kwik Trip ten minutes early. Jenny was already counting her drawer, looking anxious to leave.

""Anything I should know from today?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.

""All normal."" She wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Oh, but Patricia wants you to restock the cooler. Pepsi truck came late.""

I nodded. ""No problem.""

As she gathered her things, I cleared my throat. ""Hey, Jenny? Do you know anything about a guy named Erik Olson who used to work here?""

She froze, then slowly zipped her bag. ""Don't ask about him.""

""Why not?""

""Because some things are better left alone."" She headed for the door, then paused. ""Did you follow the rules last night?""

""Yeah.""

She nodded. ""Keep doing that."" The bell above the door jingled as she left.

Stocking the cooler took longer than expected. By the time I finished, it was already 11:15 PM. No customers had come in, and the store felt unusually quiet, as if the usual background noises had been muffled.

I walked to the bathroom, following rule one by locking it and hanging the ""Out of Order"" sign. As I turned away, I caught movement in my peripheral vision. Something dark shifted in the beverage cooler I'd just stocked.

I spun around. Nothing there but rows of neatly arranged sodas and energy drinks.

At midnight, I unplugged the coffee machines as required. A truck driver came in shortly after, looking disappointed when I told him we had no coffee.

""When will it be back up?"" he asked, scratching his beard.

""After four,"" I replied, remembering rule two's oddly specific time of 4:13 AM.

He grunted and grabbed an energy drink instead. As he paid, he glanced toward the bathroom hallway and frowned.

""Someone in there?""

I followed his gaze. The hallway was empty. ""No, bathroom's out of order tonight.""

""Huh."" He squinted. ""Thought I saw someone walk down there.""

My skin prickled. ""Must have been a shadow.""

He didn't look convinced but left without another word.

At 1 AM, I checked my phone. Three missed calls from Uncle Lars. I was about to call him back when the store phone rang. Three rings, then I picked up.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

Breathing, soft and rhythmic. Then, so quietly I almost missed it, a whisper: ""Erik?""

I slammed the phone down, heart hammering against my ribs. My hands trembled as I pulled out the rules sheet and read number three again. It didn't say what to do if the caller actually spoke.

I tried calling my uncle, but the line was dead. No dial tone, nothing. My cell phone showed no service.

At 1:30 AM, I noticed the milk in the dairy case‚Äîgallon jugs lined up in neat rows. One of them had tipped over, white liquid slowly spreading across the shelf. I remembered rule six: no selling milk after 1 AM. Was this why?

I grabbed paper towels and cleaned up the spill, righting the jug. As I did, I noticed something strange about the consistency‚Äîthicker than milk should be, almost like glue.

When I turned around, a bag of chips lay on the floor in aisle three.

My throat tightened. I got the tongs from behind the counter and carefully picked up the bag. As I placed it back on the shelf, I heard a soft thud from the back of the store.

The storage room.

I should ignore it. Nothing in the rules said I had to investigate strange noises. But curiosity pulled at me, mixed with a growing sense that these rules weren't just some practical joke.

I walked slowly toward the storage room, flashlight in hand. The door was slightly ajar, darkness spilling out like ink.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded thin in the quiet store.

No response, but the darkness seemed to shift, as if it had density and weight.

I pushed the door open wider with my foot. The smell hit me immediately‚Äînot the chemical cleanser scent you'd expect, but something earthier. Like freshly turned soil and something underneath it, something rotten.

The beam of my flashlight revealed normal shelves stacked with inventory‚Äîpaper products, boxes of candy, cleaning supplies. Nothing unusual except for a small door in the back wall. A closet, maybe, or access to plumbing.

I'd taken three steps into the room when I heard the distinct sound of the bathroom door handle turning. I whirled around, heart racing.

Rule ten echoed in my mind: If you notice the bathroom door is open at any point during your shift, despite having locked it, close the store immediately and leave the premises.

I backed out of the storage room, keeping my eyes fixed on the hallway leading to the bathroom. The handle turned again, more forcefully this time. Then stopped.

I stood frozen, unsure what to do. Run? Stay at the register as the rules required for some situations? The rules didn't specify what to do if the door tried to open but didn't actually succeed.

A sharp crack split the silence as the bathroom door shuddered in its frame. Something wanted out.

I ran to the front of the store, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"" and bolt, when headlights swept across the parking lot. A car pulled up to the pump outside.

An ordinary-looking middle-aged woman in a winter coat entered, nodding politely. ""Just the gas on pump three, please.""

I rang her up on autopilot, trying not to show my panic. As she handed me her credit card, I noticed she was wearing a red scarf.

Rule five flashed through my mind: If you see a customer wearing a red scarf, do not make eye contact. Complete their transaction quickly and do not engage in conversation.

I kept my eyes down, swiping her card and handing her the receipt without a word.

""You're awfully quiet tonight,"" she said, voice pleasant. ""Everything okay?""

I nodded, still not looking up.

""You can look at me, young man. I don't bite."" She laughed, the sound wrong somehow‚Äîtoo hollow, too rehearsed.

""Have a good night,"" I mumbled, focusing on the counter.

She didn't move. ""I knew Erik, you know. Such a nice boy. You remind me of him.""

Every muscle in my body tensed. I said nothing.

""He didn't follow the rules."" Her voice dropped lower. ""Don't make his mistake.""

When I finally looked up, she was gone. The store was empty, though I hadn't heard the door chime.

Outside, pump three stood vacant. No car. No woman.

At 3:33 AM, I faced the northeast camera and counted backward from ten as instructed. As I reached ""one,"" the lights flickered, and every screen in the store‚Äîthe register, the ATM, the lottery machine‚Äîbriefly showed the same image: a dark figure standing in the bathroom.

By morning, I was a wreck. I'd spent the remaining hours of my shift standing rigidly at the register, jumping at every noise. The bathroom door had stopped its assault, but occasional scratching sounds continued until dawn.

Harold arrived at 6 AM sharp, taking one look at me and frowning.

""Rough night?""

I nodded weakly.

""You saw something,"" he stated, not a question.

""The woman in the red scarf,"" I whispered. ""She wasn't real, was she?""

Harold's face paled. ""You talked to her?""

""No‚Äîwell, she talked to me. I didn't respond.""

He relaxed slightly. ""Good. That's good."" He hesitated. ""Look, if you're smart, you won't come back tonight.""

""What happens if I don't follow the rules?""

Harold's eyes darted toward the bathroom hallway. ""You become one of them.""

I should have quit right then. Any reasonable person would have. But I've never been accused of being reasonable, and frankly, I needed the money. Plus, something about this situation had hooked into my curiosity like a fish barb‚Äîpainful to remove.

Uncle Lars was out when I got home, so I collapsed into bed without bothering to eat. My sleep was fractured by dreams of red scarves and bathroom doors that wouldn't stay locked.

I woke to knocking around three in the afternoon. Uncle Lars stood in the doorway, concern etched across his weathered face.

""You look like hell, kid.""

I sat up groggily. ""Thanks.""

""Got something for you."" He tossed a small object onto the bed. A silver pendant on a leather cord‚Äîa five-pointed star inscribed with symbols I didn't recognize.

""What's this supposed to be?""

""Protection."" He crossed his arms. ""Belonged to your grandmother. She was S√°mi, you know.""

I turned the pendant over in my hand. ""Like from northern Scandinavia?""

He nodded. ""The old people brought more than recipes when they came here. They brought their beliefs too."" He shifted uncomfortably. ""You should wear it. Especially at that gas station.""

""You don't actually believe‚Äî""

""Just wear it, Finn."" His tone left no room for argument. ""And call me if anything strange happens.""

After he left, I fired up my laptop and searched for information about Kwik Trip #483. Most results were benign‚Äîjob postings, company press releases‚Äîbut a few local news articles caught my attention.

The first, from five years ago: ""Local Man Missing: Erik Olson, 24, Disappeared During Night Shift."" The article mentioned police finding no evidence of foul play, though security cameras showed he never left the building.

The second, dated three years ago: ""Unexplained Phenomena Plague Local Business."" This one detailed customer complaints about unusual cold spots, electronic malfunctions, and ""unsettling encounters"" with staff who ""didn't seem quite right.""

The most recent was from last month: ""Four Employees Hospitalized After Late-Night Incident."" It reported that three were found unconscious in the freezer while the fourth, Anthony ""Tony"" Gustafson, remained missing. Authorities suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, though tests came back negative.

I dug deeper, searching for historical information about the property. A local history blog provided the missing pieces: the land had originally belonged to Lars Svenson, an immigrant from Sweden who'd built a farmhouse there in the late 1800s. In 1931, he was found dead in his root cellar, surrounded by strange artifacts and journal entries describing ""entities that walk between worlds."" The property changed hands several times before Kwik Trip purchased it in 2010.

Before heading to work, I slipped the pendant around my neck, feeling foolish but strangely comforted by its weight against my chest.

Patricia was at the store when I arrived, sorting through paperwork in her small office.

""Heard you had an interesting second night,"" she said without looking up.

I froze in the doorway. ""Who told you that?""

""Harold mentions things."" She finally met my eyes. ""You saw her, didn't you? The woman in the red scarf?""

My mouth went dry. ""You know about her?""

Patricia sighed, suddenly looking much older. ""Sit down, Finn."" She gestured to the chair across from her desk. ""I should explain some things.""

I sat, heart thumping against my ribs.

""That building,"" she began, ""it's not normal. Never has been. When they built it, they found things in the ground. Old things. The construction crew wanted to stop, but corporate pushed ahead.""

""What kind of things?""

""Symbols carved in stone. Bones arranged in patterns. A box made of some metal they couldn't identify."" She rubbed her temples. ""They moved it all, built right over the site.""

""And then what?""

""Then people started seeing things. Hearing things."" She pulled open a drawer and took out a bottle of pills, swallowing one dry. ""At first, we thought it was just stories. Every small town has them, right? But then employees started going missing. Erik first, then others.""

""Tony Gustafson,"" I supplied.

She nodded. ""We found the rules taped to the bathroom mirror one morning. Don't know who put them there‚Äîthe cameras showed nothing. But we noticed something. If we followed them, nothing bad happened.""

""So you just accepted it? People vanishing, weird rules appearing from nowhere?""

Patricia's laugh held no humor. ""What would you have me do? Call corporate and tell them our store is haunted? That we need to follow magic rules to keep the monsters away?"" She shook her head. ""They'd shut us down, and then what happens to this town? Kwik Trip is the biggest employer here now that the mill closed.""

I thought about that. Hallock was already dying like so many small towns. Without the gas station, it might disappear entirely.

""So what are these things? Ghosts?""

She looked uncomfortable. ""Not exactly. More like.. visitors. They can only cross over at certain times, under certain conditions. The rules prevent those conditions.""

""And the woman in the red scarf?""

""She's the worst of them."" Patricia's voice dropped to a whisper. ""She looks for weaknesses. Tests boundaries. Don't ever speak to her.""

The store phone rang, making us both jump.

""That'll be Jenny,"" Patricia said, standing. ""She's running late.""

Before leaving for the night, Patricia handed me a key on a plain metal ring.

""For the storage room cabinet,"" she explained. ""There's a box inside with chalk, salt, and some other items. If the bathroom door opens‚Äînot just tries to open, but actually opens‚Äîuse them to draw a circle around yourself. Stay inside it until dawn.""

I pocketed the key, nodding despite my skepticism.

The first few hours of my shift passed quietly. I checked off the rules methodically‚Äîlock the bathroom at 11:30, unplug coffee machines at midnight. The phone rang at 1:05 AM. Three rings, then I answered.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

This time, instead of breathing, I heard what sounded like water dripping. Slow, steady plops in the background. Then a man's voice, distant yet clear:

""They're coming up through the floor now.""

The line went dead. I stood frozen, receiver still pressed to my ear, blood rushing in my veins.

A crash from aisle three broke the spell. I hung up and cautiously approached the sound. Not just one bag of chips this time‚Äîthe entire rack had toppled, sending bags scattering across the linoleum.

I remembered rule nine: The chips in aisle three sometimes fall off the shelves. Return them only using the tongs kept behind the counter.

I grabbed the tongs and began picking up bags, my hands shaking. Each time I put one back, I could feel something watching me. The weight of unseen eyes pressed against my back, yet every time I turned around, I was alone.

The mess took nearly twenty minutes to clean. As I returned the last bag to the shelf, the store went completely silent. The ever-present hum of coolers, the soft buzz of fluorescent lights‚Äîall stopped.

In that vacuum of sound, I heard it clearly: a wet, sliding noise from behind the bathroom door. Like something large and damp dragging itself across tile.

Then scratching‚Äînot the tentative sounds from previous nights, but frantic, desperate clawing.

I backed away, fingers closing around the storage room key in my pocket.

At the back of the store, I fumbled with the lock on the metal cabinet Patricia had mentioned. Inside, I found an old shoebox containing a bag of salt, a stub of chalk, and a small leather-bound book. I grabbed everything and hurried back to the front.

The scratching had grown louder, punctuated now by a rhythmic thumping, as if something heavy was throwing itself against the door.

My hands trembled as I opened the book. The pages were filled with handwritten notes, diagrams, and what looked like prayers in various languages. A bookmark indicated a page titled ""Emergency Protocols."" Below it were instructions for creating protective circles and barriers, complete with illustrations.

THUMP. The bathroom door shuddered in its frame.

Working quickly, I used the chalk to draw a circle around the register area, copying the symbols from the book along its circumference. I poured salt along the line, reciting words I didn't understand from the page.

CRACK. Wood splintered as something struck the bathroom door with terrifying force.

I completed the circle just as the bathroom door burst open. From my position behind the counter, I couldn't see the hallway, but darkness spilled from it‚Äînot simply absence of light, but something deeper, like liquid shadow.

Within that darkness, something moved. I caught glimpses‚Äîa limb too long to be human, fingers that bent backward, eyes that reflected light like an animal's.

I clutched the pendant Uncle Lars had given me, its metal warm against my palm. The darkness reached the edge of my chalk circle and stopped, roiling against an invisible barrier.

A voice whispered from within the shadows, neither male nor female, young nor old.

""Let us in, keeper. The door is open.""

My throat constricted. ""What do you want?""

""To cross over. To exist in your world."" The darkness curled like smoke. ""So many spaces between things here. So many gaps to fill.""

""What happened to the others? Erik? Tony?""

""They serve. They bridge worlds. As will you, in time.""

Something scraped across the floor‚Äîa fallen candy bar, sliding along the tile, pushed by an unseen force. It stopped just at the edge of my circle.

""A gift,"" the voice said. ""We are not unkind. We offer exchange.""

""I don't want anything from you.""

""You seek answers. We have them.""

The darkness pulsed, and within it appeared a face I recognized from news photos‚ÄîTony Gustafson. His eyes were wrong‚Äîtoo dark, too empty.

""The rules protect the store,"" he said, voice hollow. ""But not for your sake. They keep us contained. Weakened.""

""That's why you took people? To weaken the rules?""

The darkness rippled. ""The rules can be broken. By choice. We merely.. encourage those choices.""

Tony's face melted back into the shadows.

""Your uncle knows more than he says,"" the voice continued. ""Ask him about the Svenson cellar. Ask what his grandfather found there.""

Ice shot through my veins. ""How do you know about my uncle?""

""We know all who have touched this place.""

The darkness withdrew slightly, contracting toward the hallway.

""Dawn approaches. We must retreat."" The voice grew fainter. ""But we'll return tonight. And the next. There is no escaping us now that you've seen.""

I remained motionless in my protective circle as the darkness receded, slithering back down the hallway and into the bathroom. The door swung shut with a soft click.

The store's normal sounds returned in a rush‚Äîcoolers humming, lights buzzing. I stayed in my circle until 6 AM, when Harold arrived.

He took one look at the chalk markings and paled.

""The door opened?""

I nodded, too exhausted to speak.

""Jesus."" He crossed himself. ""You need to talk to Maggie Olson.""

""Erik's mother? Why?""

""Because she knows how to close what's been opened."" He glanced nervously at the bathroom. ""And because she's been waiting for someone like you‚Äîsomeone who saw them and survived.""

I drove home in a fog of exhaustion and fear, my mind replaying the night's events. Uncle Lars was in the kitchen making coffee when I stumbled in.

""You look rough,"" he noted, eyebrows furrowed. ""Coffee?""

I collapsed into a chair. ""Something happened last night.""

His hand stilled on the coffee pot. ""What kind of something?""

""The bathroom door opened."" The words felt inadequate to describe the horror I'd witnessed. ""There was.. darkness. And voices.""

Lars set a mug in front of me with unexpected gentleness. ""You're wearing the pendant."" It wasn't a question.

""It helped."" I wrapped my fingers around the warm mug. ""The darkness couldn't cross some circle I drew.""

""Good."" He pulled out a chair and sat heavily. ""Your grandmother's people knew about such things.""

""Uncle Lars, what do you know about the Svenson cellar?""

His face drained of color. ""Who told you about that?""

""The thing in the darkness."" I took a sip of coffee, wincing at its bitterness. ""It said to ask what your grandfather found there.""

Lars was silent for a long moment, then stood and walked to a cabinet above the refrigerator. He returned with a dusty bottle of aquavit and poured a generous splash into his coffee.

""My grandfather,"" he began, ""worked for Lars Svenson as a farm hand. In the fall of 1931, Svenson became.. obsessed with his root cellar. Spent hours down there. Started telling folks he'd found a door.""

""A door to what?""

""He wouldn't say."" Lars took a long swallow of his spiked coffee. ""One night, my grandfather heard screaming from the cellar. Found Svenson dead, surrounded by strange markings. And a hole in the earth that seemed to go down forever.""

My skin prickled. ""What happened to the hole?""

""They filled it with concrete. Tons of it. Covered the whole area."" He refilled his mug. ""When Kwik Trip bought the land, they dug it all up again.""

""And now things are coming through.""

Lars nodded grimly. ""Maggie Olson might know more. Her family has been in this area since before the Svensons.""

""Harold said the same thing. That I need to talk to her.""

""You should. Today."" He stood up. ""I'll drive you out there after you've rested.""

I slept dreamlessly for six hours. When I woke, the sun was already lowering in the sky, painting the snow-covered fields gold and pink. Uncle Lars was waiting in his pickup, engine running.

The Olson farm sat eight miles outside of town, a white two-story farmhouse with a red barn and several outbuildings. As we pulled into the gravel driveway, a large dog‚Äîsome kind of husky mix‚Äîbounded toward us, barking enthusiastically.

A stocky older man with a full beard emerged from the barn. Sven Olson, I presumed. He recognized my uncle and raised a hand in greeting.

""Lars. Been a while.""

""Sven."" My uncle nodded. ""This here's my nephew, Finn. He's working nights at the Kwik Trip.""

Sven's expression hardened. ""Maggie's inside.""

Maggie Olson was a small woman with silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun. Her kitchen was warm and smelled of fresh bread, but her eyes were sharp and evaluating as she looked me over.

""So you're the new night clerk."" She poured coffee into ceramic mugs. ""And you saw something.""

I nodded, accepting the coffee. ""Last night. The bathroom door opened.""

""And before that? The woman in the red scarf, I'm guessing.""

""Yes. And phone calls. Scratching noises.""

Maggie sighed, sitting down across from me. ""It always follows the same pattern. First the small disturbances, then the manifestations, then."" She faltered.

""Then people disappear,"" I finished.

She nodded, eyes bright with unshed tears. ""My Erik was a good boy. Smart. He was saving for college, working that night shift. Then one morning, he just.. never came home.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, meaning it.

""The police looked everywhere. Said he must have run off."" Her voice hardened. ""But I know better. He's still there, trapped between our world and theirs.""

""Can we help him? Them?""

Maggie and Sven exchanged glances. ""Maybe,"" she said finally. ""But it's dangerous. What do you know about the Svensons?""

I repeated what Lars had told me. Maggie nodded along, then stood and left the room, returning with an old leather-bound book similar to the one I'd found in the storage room.

""The Svensons weren't just farmers,"" she explained, laying the book on the table. ""They were keepers of old knowledge. Lars Svenson believed certain places were thin spots between worlds. Doorways.""

""And he found one in his cellar,"" I said.

""He created one,"" Maggie corrected. ""The symbols, the rituals‚Äîhe was trying to reach something. And he succeeded.""

She opened the book to a page showing intricate diagrams‚Äîcircles within circles, filled with strange symbols. My breath caught; they looked like the protective circle I'd drawn last night.

""These barriers were designed to keep things in, not out,"" she continued. ""The rules at the Kwik Trip do the same. They maintain the balance, keep the door from opening completely.""

""But people have disappeared.""

She nodded grimly. ""The entities need vessels to exist fully in our world. They take people when the rules weaken.""

""Like Erik,"" I murmured.

""And now they've marked you,"" Sven said, speaking for the first time since we'd entered the kitchen. ""Once they know you, they don't stop.""

A shiver ran down my back. ""What can I do?""

Maggie turned more pages in the book, stopping at an illustration of what looked like a sealing ritual.

""We can close the door. Permanently."" Her finger traced the diagram. ""But it requires someone who's seen them and survived. Someone they've spoken to.""

""Me,"" I realized.

""Yes. And it must be done when the barrier is thinnest‚Äî3:33 AM.""

""Tonight?""

Maggie nodded. ""If you're willing.""

""What do I need to do?""

""We'll come to the store after midnight,"" she explained. ""You'll need to create a distraction so we can access the bathroom without being seen on cameras. Corporate monitors them remotely.""

""What kind of distraction?""

""A power outage would work,"" Sven suggested. ""Brief enough not to raise alarms, but long enough for us to get inside.""

""I can pull the breaker for a few minutes,"" I offered.

""Good."" Maggie closed the book. ""Once inside, we'll need to perform the sealing ritual. It's not complicated, but it must be precise.""

""And if it works?""

""If it works, the door closes forever. The entities return to their world, and our world goes back to normal.""

""Even the people they've taken? Erik? Tony?""

Maggie's expression faltered. ""I don't know. I hope so.""

As we drove back to town, Uncle Lars was unusually quiet.

""You think this will work?"" I finally asked.

""If anyone can close that door, it's Maggie Olson."" He kept his eyes on the snowy road. ""But Finn? Be careful. Those things.. they're clever. They'll say anything to keep their doorway open.""

I nodded, fingering the pendant around my neck. ""I'll be careful.""

He dropped me off at the Kwik Trip fifteen minutes before my shift. Jenny was already

Alan's POV

Somber music played as I glanced at the window.

The sky was tar-black and the large clouds were moving towards me.

I heard a tapping on the window and then it became a pitter-patter.

People ran for cover outside and umbrellas were opened as the clouds spat out their beads of water.

Puddles began plinking as the rainfall became heavier.

The roofs of the cars danced with spray and I could hear the murmuring of the rain through the window.

It sounded like the buzzing of angry bees.

All I could think of is him. I told him to stay away for a reason but then, why do I feel this way?

The smell of coffee hits my nose. It was his favorite, having to just sit alone and think of the memories we'd spend together.

The coffee I had prepared earlier was adjacent him, sitting on the table and perhaps wondering if i'd touch it.

I returned to the dining table across me, cold and lonely like a heavy weight was on me.

My mind was void of thoughts. My eyes travelled to the phone that laid on the table, beside the mug of coffee.

I was nervous, awaiting his calls, my heart throbs as goosebumps held me.

It was hard trying not feel interested when I anticipate to see.

The rain made the world around me feel dreary, soggy, and depressing, sapping energy and vitality.

We were never meant to be together. It hits hard but sometimes it's best to let someone go.

It wasn't love at first sight, I was the boss, he was the bodyguard. The cold and sturdy who frightens people away from me.

I only grew interest in him when he laid down his life for me, during a parade.

I almost almost hit by a hired assassin and he saved me, taking the bullet for me.

He seems as one who'd have no love interest as he look dead serious.

Sometimes, he makes me fret with that devilish gaze of his. He was handsome and anyone would fall for him.

His charisma, he was the only one that could tame me, go against my will and I got so attached to him that the emotion came crawling in.

I fell so deeply in love that I thought I was going insane.

He was the only one who made my heart fluster in a long while. His cooky smile, his husky voice.

Whenever I'd almost given up, his encouragement jolts me back to strive.

He made me realize I was special but then, it's a sheraid.

Everything about him filled my head.

Perhaps, I was just confused about my emotions too. I tried so hard to forget him but it's not working.

Loving is hard, it don't always work, I just try my best not to get hurt.

I use to close to my eyes and pray for a moment when everything would be fine between us.

However, it just has to end.

I recall peering at him from my window, with a broad smile without realizing it.

I was crazy and he made me do things I'd never imagined.

In few days, I'd be getting married and...

My thoughts were distracted when the doorbell rang. I shuddered and I cleared my throat.

They were here...

I took a long evaluation of the sitting room, if it still needed a touch and after being satisfied by the turn out, I swallowed hard.

Languorously, I stomped towards the door. I tried to stay composed so that my flaws wouldn't be detected.

Spurring it open, I found him in the rain. Water dripping off his body as his cold gaze peers at me.

He had his dark outfit as always, his body quivers in the rain as it lashes on him.

His gaze affected me in so many ways that my heart melted. I felt he'd burn me with those eyes.

He probably hates me, for ditching him. I thought that's the best way, to protect him, and not raise suspicions.

I was stunned he shouldn't be here. He breath was hazel as he part his lips, he looked piteous.

It was obvious he hadn't gotten enough sleep judging from the dark rings that circled his eyes.

My family would be coming over and it would be ridiculous finding him here, it's meant to be a private family meeting.

I couldn't leave him in the rain either, he seems tensed and I was emotionally. My body shook as we both stared at each other.

""Is this a goodbye?"" He mutters and tears brewed up in my eyes.

He came back and I was hurting just as he was. This shouldn't be a goodbye yet.

I was mute, having no words to say, I didn't want him the cold. I thought pushing him away to end the emotions I had for him.

However, it made me realize that he was the one, the best thing I ever knew I needed.

""Peris..."" I muttered softly, barely recognizing my voice. However, before I could flutter my eyes, he captured my lips.

He parted my lips widely as I gasp, my body lazily rubbed on him and I was weak.

His wet body soaks my shirt too and his hair trickled water on my face, his kiss grew hungrier as we exchanged breath.

His body enveloped mine, as his strong arms went around my waist. I felt he'd take the rest of my miserable soul away.

I missed his touch and pretending not to want him was killing.

I broke out the kiss and stuttered back. I took a long gasp for air, almost suffocating.

""We shouldn't be doing this peris"" I said shivering and trying to grasp my breath.

""I know but I... can't stop thinking of you..."" He reply and with just a step, he drew closer to me.

However, my phone beeps and the doorbell rings too. It's my family, they were here.

""Peris, you've got to leave...""

""No they've got to leave because I want you tonight"" he cuts in with pain, anger and lust in his eyes.

# Chapter 2: Passion and Lust

Alan's POV

I was startled, unmoved and jinxed over this man. Sometimes when he speaks, I wonder who's the boss among us.

He walk clumsily to where my phone laid and switched it off, then returned back to him.

I've got no choice than to yield to his demand.

I passionately stared at him, my dick arouse, wanting to burst out of my pant. My breath ceased for a moment as he suddenly embraced me.

He gave me the respect of an equal but cradled me like a cherished child.

""I miss you Alan""

In that embrace i felt my worries loose their keen sting and my optimism raise its head from the dirt.

Perhaps the hope had been there all along, but without some love it was trapped, like crystals in a stone.

I felt him brush my hair back with his piano player fingers and kiss me gently.

In his embrace the world stopped still on its axis.

There was no time, no wind, no rain. My mind was at peace.

How could it be that I¬† hadn't seen peris love for what it was before? Pure. Unselfish. Undemanding. Free.

I felt my body press in, soft and warm. This was the love i'd waited for, prayed for.

I threw my arm around his neck and resumes his kiss. We stared at each other intensely as I felt hot.

My body yield to the sensation I felt around him. He jerked me up and I wrapped my thighs around his waist.

He was strong enough to have me roped around him.

Our kiss grew wildly as he fondled my skin. Our dick rubbed against each other while he walked with me on the stairs.

That kiss was a long liquid one that sent gush of lust flushing inside me.

It made me forget the occasion of today, the family were coming over with the bride they had chosen for me.

Certainly, they'd be stuck outside while I make out with my man, my lover and my world.

I chuckled in his mouth, we'd be quick before they arrive. We exchanged saliva and groan in each other's mouth.

His cold body was replaced by the heat we've emitted. We wanted each other and there was hiding about it.

When we got to the door, he slammed my back on it and began to kiss my neck.

My back was my support as I tightened my grip on his waist. His hands quickly ripped off my shirt.

I raised my chest high as his eyes lurch at it.

Fuck!

He missed kissing and harassing this chest of me. I also wanted to see his, having to carass his little breast and feel his heat.

My skin tampers as I suck my breath, trying to maintain a balance on him. His eyes darken on my skin as he slaps my chest.

""Arghh, more work out huh"" he whispers naughtily.

""To impress you"" i muttered with a lustful gaze at him while tilting my body closer to his.

His wet shirt sent cold running down my spine. I leaned my head on his forehead as I was mesmerized.

""Make me feel wanted peris...fuck me hard, I'm all yours"" I plead feeling so hot and tensed to have him do his thing on me.

To bring me alive from my misery and to make up for the days we never got to meet, the days that felt like i'd die with his touch.

He let out a dirty smile;

""You'd get hurt"" he whispers reminding me of how wild he could be.

""You always hurt me"" I replied and then kissed him.

He placed his hand on my throat as though choking me and I gaggled pouring out saliva while slamming my head on the door.

Then he dropped those hands on my waist while licking my chest. His wet, warm tongue tickles.

""Open it!"" He ordered. My shaky hands grabbed the doorknob while trying to digest the hurt.

I felt I'd fall from him as he moved with me inside the bed room.

He dropped me gently on the ground and gulped hard.

""Strip for daddy baby"" I said.

""Oh, you'd take the lead now?""

I gulped hard speechless and quivering where I stood, an inch opposite him.

I knew I could never be perfect but I wanted to take the lead.

He slowly began to unbutton his wet shirt, he took off his pant and his erect dick points at my pant.

It was large, so big that I often wonder how my butt hole fits to his, hungry dick.

His abs were enticing and inviting that I felt I'd cum without him touching me.

With him, I have had several wet dreams and didn't want to see him with any other than me.

The look on his face was as unhindered as i‚Äôd ever seen. Naked, and not a small bit desperate.

He stood at akimbo, torturing with that position. I couldn't hold myself as I wanted him to take away from this world.

His tattooed skin was alluring. He had my name written on his arm. I felt loved.

My dick throbs and I had to lubricate it with my palm. I poured saliva in my hand, paste in on the dick and rub it.

I paced closer to him, not wanting to waste time.

I placed a hand upon his cheek, my thumb grazing the soft contour of his mouth.

His mouth grabbed my thumb as he sucks it. Our cock ram against each other.

They've missed each other too. I let out a soft gasp as he soon swallowed all my fingers while our chest pinned on each other.

I almost screamed as his body was on fire. Wasn't he drenched in the rain earlier.

He trailed a lazy finger down the length of my cock, and my skin prickled at the touch.

His other hand knead my butt to his taste as i sucked his breasts. He was passionately gazing at me and I was lost.

His strong thighs clasp with mine.

The taste of him was woodsmoke and ale and bright mountain‚Äôs mint, as alluring as it was familiar.

""Kneel!"" He commands with a dirty gaze at me. His voice grasp in his throat.

I gulped hard as I did just want he said. Seductively, I went on my knees, wrapped my arms around his waist.

His erect dick points to my face, grinning and perhaps desperately wanting to fuck me.

He goad his dick with his hand and grinned naughty at me.

He placed his free hand on my cheek, digging his fingers on my jawline and forcing me open my mouth.",1,1747476157.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

There are so many different types of business and registers and I started to wonder how they really worked. I once had a toy shop that was highly unsuccessful but at least I know how to build that. However, when it comes to other types, like a shop inside of a different lot or even a bakery, I'm really lost.

My questions were also if anyone knew a tutorial to it or mods? For example, if I want a library to have a small coffee area, would it work if I put a food register down like for seasons (I'm talking about the one also in Around the sims). Or would it not? If I want to make a gas station, what kind of register would I use? A consignment store one or again a food one? 

If I want a sim to be a sort of receptionist to a public lot (library, spa, amusement park) would I need to build it like a shop? And would the main attraction still be the public lot? 

what are the different uses of the following registers : Food register, food cash register, cash register, general cash/store register, general store register, food store register.

I know it is a lengthy post and I am sorry about it.

The stench of alcohol and sweat clings to Ciel almost like a second skin as he groans awake, finding himself face pressed against a cold, hard floor. He lifts himself and rests his back against the nearest wall, his vision blurring, his mouth dry and his head is pounding crazy as if there's a drum war.

Once his vision cleared, he rolled his green eyes after taking a quick scan of his surroundings‚Äîthe four walls of a prison cell he's awfully familiar with‚Äîalways stinking with filth and stains. He could hear the squinching sound of rats.

‚ÄúNice seeing you again, pal.‚Äù He says with a smirk at the man cowering at the far end of the wall, staring at him as if he's grown an extra head on his shoulders.

Ciel scoffs as he combs his fingers through his messy white hair and rests his head, trying to recall how he landed himself back in this shitty place for the third time in two weeks. At least he didn't find himself in some ditch; that's more humiliating than finding himself on the front cover caught in bed naked and drugged.

‚ÄúReid!‚Äù

The officer's loud voice yanks him out of his thoughts. He hiss as his head pounds harder. ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù His grunts, his voice husky from drinking, shouting and God knows what else's that landed him in jail.

The officer opens the cell, his brows furrowing with irritation. ‚ÄúGet your ass up, your babysitter is here.‚Äù He barks.

Ciels unhurriedly gets up to his feet. He runs his fingers through his hair one more time, then waves at his cell companion before following the officer out.

Ciel expects to be released, instead, he's led to the interrogation room and shoved inside.

His Manager, Lucas welcomes him with a hard stare blazing through his blue eyes. His jaw is clenched and his arms are crossed over his chest sitting on a chair behind a metal table. Despite his irked state, he looks every inch the Hollywood Manager.

‚ÄúLucas, always a pleasure.‚Äù Ciel sneers as he sinks into the empty chair opposite his Manager. His green eyes glint with mischief. ‚ÄúYou are going to interrogate me now? Make it spicy.‚Äù He flashes him a naughty smile. ‚ÄúMissed me?‚Äù

The veins in Luca's temple throbs painfully as he presses his lips into a thin line, seeming to calm himself from exploding. ‚ÄúMissed you? I haven't had the time to. I've spent the past seven hours doing damage control since you thought it'd be fun to go viral again. Do you even realize what kind of mess you've landed us in this time?‚Äù He strives to control his rage but the fire in his blue eyes is a betrayer.

Ciel shrugs with nonchalance as he leans back and crosses his arms over his chest. ‚ÄúMy mind is still hazy, care to enlighten me, sunshine?‚Äù

Luca breathes through his nose as he slams a newspaper on the table, the headlines screaming boldly; New York times‚Äî‚ÄòBadboy or burnout? Ciel Reid's career finally circling the drain‚Äô

There are photos attached, showing him being dragged out of the club handcuffed and flipping off the cameras of reporters.

So, that's what happened. He snorts. ‚ÄúHow creative.‚Äù He points at the headline, then at the photos. ‚ÄúNice shot though, my jawline looks great from this angle.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Luca growls and immediately rubs his temple as he feels a headache manifesting. ‚ÄúYou are a goddamn trainwreck! Do you realize how many calls I've had to take? Producers, sponsors, PR reps‚Äîeveryone of them is furious and wants to terminate their contracts with you. Your career is hanging by a fucking thread, Ciel!‚Äù He runs a hand through his blond hair and continues. ‚ÄúHave you forgotten how much effort you've put into this over the years, the blood, sweat and tears? Don't you care even a little or are you hellbound on self-destruction that nothing else seems to matter?‚Äù

Ciel averts his gaze, staring at nothing as a pang takes residence in his chest. Exhaling, he pins Lucas with a hard gawk. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say? That I'm sorry? That I will change? We all know how it's gonna end.‚Äù

Lucas inhales deeply. ‚ÄúI don't want an apology, your career is one scandal away from crashing and as your Manager and best friend, I won't allow it. Fortunately, before this city completely ruins your years of effort. I have a solution.‚Äù

Ciel stays silent as he watches Lucas take out a script from his bag. He pushes it towards him.

‚ÄúI've secured you one last chance. A film‚Äî a high profile one. If you nail this, your reputation will be as good as new.‚Äù

Ciel takes the script, skimming through the details. ‚ÄúWhy will they want me for this?‚Äù

‚ÄùThey don't.‚Äù Luca states bluntly. ""But the financier insisted on you. Xerxes Laurent."" He pauses and stares but Ciel only frowns at the name as it doesn't ring a bell.

""Never heard of him.""

""You will,"" Luca is grim. ""He‚Äôs‚Ä¶let‚Äôs just say, not someone you want to cross. He‚Äôs funding the entire project, but he wants to meet you to discuss some conditions.‚Äù

Conditions?‚Äù Ciel‚Äôs tone sharpens.

Luca‚Äôs jaw tightens. ‚ÄúDiscuss... terms, that's what his assistant said.‚Äù

‚ÄúTerms for what? My soul?‚Äù Ciel jests. He can bet he doesn't have one, probably died the day his innocence was forcefully ripped from him.¬† A knot forms in his throat. He could almost hear his father‚Äôs voice, sneering in his ear annoyingly. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll never be anything more than a pretty face. A tool to be used and discarded‚Äô

‚ÄúCiel, listen to me,‚Äù Luca verbalizes, his voice low and urgent. ‚ÄúThis man doesn‚Äôt play games. Whatever he‚Äôs offering, you need to take it seriously. Your career depends on it.‚Äù

Ciel leans back, letting out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYou know, Lucas, you‚Äôre starting to sound like my dad. Do this, Ciel. Be a good little boy, Ciel.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a joke,‚Äù Luca snaps. ‚ÄúYou either take this, or you kiss your career goodbye.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, you don't have to be so irked‚Äù he waves dismissively. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what Mr. Moneybags wants.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you for once, not screw this up?‚Äù

Ciel snort. ‚ÄúI will try to be on my best behavior but for the meantime, can you get me out of here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou messed with the wrong person last night, you will be detained for the next 24 hours. Use the time to think about what you want, Ciel. Really think. Because whatever Xerxes Laurent wants from you..."" He trails off, leaving the warning unspoken..‚Äù

Ciel hisses in annoyance. ‚ÄúFucking bastard!‚Äù

# CHAPTER 002

Ciel shifts uncomfortably in his seat. He spreads his legs, hoping to get more comfortable but as the seconds drag by, he feels like he's soon going to lose his mind. He glances at Lucas who sits beside him on the sofa, looking polished and professional‚ÄîLucas only casts him a look that makes him sigh.

He keeps himself busy by looking around his surroundings for the nth time. The office is sleek, vast and intimidating. Floor-to-ceiling window showcasing the beauty of Manhattan‚Äîa black table and seat adding a feel of cold luxury.

They are in the small setting area, paired with a low glass coffee table and matching armchair. He sighs for the nth time in 30 minutes since they've been waiting.

‚ÄúWe have been waiting for 30 minutes. This is ridiculous.‚Äù he throws his head back dramatically. ‚ÄúIf he's this late for a meeting, I can only imagine how bad he is in bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúCiel, not here.‚Äù Lucas grits through his teeth and shoots him a warning look.

He shrugs. ‚ÄúHey, I'm just saying, punctuality says a lot about a man.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you for the sake of world peace act like a professional for once.‚Äù Lucas barks, his patience running thin as he looks down at his wrist watch.

‚ÄúI can fake professionalism when it counts, but this‚Ä¶?‚Äù He gestures to the whole office. ‚Äú...this is a power play. It's his way of saying he's more important than us.‚Äù He leans and rests his head on Luca's shoulder who shoves him off.

‚ÄúQuit acting like a spoiled child. This man has the power to save your career, if we have to lick his boot, so be it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's probably stuck in traffic or staring at his reflection in some expensive mirror.‚Äù Ciel laughs at his own joke and immediately shrugs when Lucas casts him an unimpressed look. ‚ÄúWhat? He's a billionaire. I bet he's got one of those talking mirrors and goes ‚ÄòMirror mirror on the wall, he's the biggest prick of them all.‚Äù‚Äô

Suddenly, the door opens with a dramatic click. Ciel's sarcastic immediately dies in his throat and he sits up instinctively, then watches as a man who's no doubt, Xerxes Laurent enters the room, followed closely by a sharp-suited assistant with a murdering gaze

Ciel's mouth slightly opens as he takes in Mr. Laurent‚Äîlooking like he's made and carved from stone. He moves effortlessly towards them, his tailored suits hug his strong physique perfectly and it blends well with his dark hair that's brushed off his smooth forehead and striking shades of icy gray orbs that look cold and calculative.

He sits on the armchair in front of them and crosses one leg over the other while his assistant stands behind him. ‚ÄúMr. Reid, Mr. Lucas.‚Äù He acknowledges them, his voice is deep and commanding. ‚ÄúI trust you've been comfortable as you waited?‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for the hospitality,‚Äù Lucas answers drily, not being able to conceal the distaste in his voice.

Ciel instantly snaps out of it. ‚ÄúOh, it was riveting.‚Äù He sneers. ‚ÄúLoved the decor, very bold villain chic.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm glad it made an impression.‚Äù

Ciel's gulps as Xerxes speaks. His deep, velvety voice seems to echo and it makes Ciel's stomach churn. Not wanting to beat around the bushes, Ciel leans forward, his green eyes pinned on the man who looks like he can command an entire army with just his gaze. ‚ÄúLet's cut to the chase, why me? You've got the money, the connection, hell, you look like you can snap your finger and the whole world will come at your feet, begging. So, why me? Especially with my reputation?‚Äù

Lucas at the moment resists the urge to facepalm and almost steps in to apologize but Xerxes beats him to it.

‚ÄúYour reputation is precisely what I need.‚Äù

Ciel blinks, caught off guard. ‚ÄúI beg your pardon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour reputation is almost irrelevant to me, I don't care for the scandals, headlines or the arrests, what I care about is what you can deliver in front of a camera. I agreed to have you on this project because you intrigue me.‚Äù

Ciel raises an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIntrigue, huh? That‚Äôs a new one. Usually, people just call me a train wreck.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you are,‚Äù Xerxes says, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talented but talent isn‚Äôt enough in this business. You‚Äôre reckless, and undisciplined, and every headline about you reads like a punchline. You‚Äôve become a liability. You‚Äôre exactly what I need.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, I should hire you for motivational speeches,‚Äù Ciel verbalizes, slightly intimidated by the man and his strange way with words but more intrigued.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt waste my time motivating people. I make them useful.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me? What's the catch?‚Äù

Suddenly, a sinister glint flashes in Xerxes‚Äô eyes and a faint smirk spreads on his lips while his assistant drops a file on the table. ‚ÄúI need the public's attention off me for a while. For the duration of the production, you will be my fianc√©e.‚Äù

The room goes silent.

Ciel blinks,¬† almost certain he misheard, he shares a glance with Lucas who looks speechless for the first time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, did you just say fianc√©e?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Xerxes replies calmly.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll attend events with me, act the part of a devoted partner, and follow my instructions without question. In return, you‚Äôll star in the film and rehabilitate your image. It‚Äôs a mutually beneficial arrangement.‚Äù

‚ÄúMutually beneficial?‚Äù Ciel repeats, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúSounds more like you‚Äôre buying a human prop.‚Äù

Xerxes rises to his feet. ‚ÄúCall it whatever you want, Mr. Reid. But the fact remains‚Äîwithout my help, your career is over.‚Äù he looks down at his expensive wrist watch. ‚ÄúYou have 48 hours to think about this and sign the contract. There are the terms and rules you need to follow as my fiance. If there's anything you need, inform my assistant, Sebastian. Have a lovely day, gentlemen.‚Äù

Without another word, he leaves, walking out of the office majestically with his assistant following him.

(Part 3 )","I never thought I'd still be working the graveyard shift at Buc-ee's on Highway 35, thirty miles south of Austin. My name's Marcus, and I've been manning this particular outpost for three years now. The massive travel center sits like a neon beacon in the darkness, drawing every kind of traveler you can imagine across the Texas landscape.

During daylight hours, families pile out of minivans loaded with coolers and kids, grabbing the famous brisket sandwiches and those overpriced beaver nuggets. But nights? That's when you meet the real Texas. Long-haul truckers pulling double trailers filled with everything from cattle to computer parts. Ranch hands driving dusty F-250s with livestock trailers, heading to auction in San Antonio. Weekend warriors in lifted Chevy Silverados, their beds stuffed with camping gear and beer coolers.

There's old Miguel, who stops every Tuesday around 2 AM in his weathered Ford pickup, buying the same exact items: two energy drinks, a bag of beef jerky, and a pack of Marlboro Reds. He tips his hat but never speaks, just nods and disappears back onto the highway. Then there's Sarah, a trucker from Minnesota who hauls frozen foods down to Mexico. She's got a mouth like a sailor and tells the best road stories I've ever heard while she waits for her logbook hours to reset.

The strangest regular is probably Tommy Chen, who drives an immaculate 1979 Peterbilt with hand-painted flames down the sides. He claims he's been driving these highways since before I was born, which would make him impossibly old based on how young he looks. Tommy only stops during the deepest part of night, always buys exactly thirteen items, and pays in cash that looks like it's fresh from the mint.

But last Thursday, something different rolled into our lot. I was restocking the coffee station around 3:30 AM when headlights swept across the windows in an odd pattern ‚Äì not the usual steady approach of a truck or car. This vehicle seemed to pause, then advance, pause again, like it was.. considering.

A massive black pickup truck finally parked under the far edge of our lighting. Not black like most trucks you see on the road, but black like the space between stars. The kind of black that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. No license plate visible from where I stood. No mud, no road dust, no scratches ‚Äì unusual for any vehicle that's spent time on Texas highways.

The driver sat motionless for nearly ten minutes. Through the tinted windshield, I could make out only the outline of someone wearing what looked like a wide-brimmed hat pulled low. No movement, no engine noise after parking. Just stillness.

Finally, the door opened with a soft click that somehow carried all the way to the store. The driver emerged slowly, wearing a long coat despite the October heat. What caught my attention wasn't the coat or the hat, though. It was the mask.

A simple white medical mask, the kind everyone wore during covid, but something about it felt wrong. Maybe it was how perfectly clean it looked, or how it seemed to catch the fluorescent light in a way that made it almost glow. The driver ‚Äì I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman ‚Äì walked with measured steps toward the entrance, never looking left or right, never acknowledging the security cameras.

I pretended to be busy with inventory as they entered. The automatic doors chimed their usual welcome, but the sound felt flat, muffled somehow. The person moved through the aisles without making any noise ‚Äì no footsteps on the polished floor, no rustle of clothing. They selected items methodically: a bottle of water, a package of crackers, and a single banana. Nothing else.

At the counter, they placed exact change on the surface without speaking. As I rang up the items, I tried to make eye contact, but the mask and hat cast shadows that seemed deeper than they should.

""Have a good night,"" I said, handing over the receipt.

They tilted their head slightly, like an animal listening to a distant sound, then walked out the same deliberate way they'd entered. The truck started without any engine noise I could hear and pulled away, taillights disappearing into the darkness of Highway 35.

That was five days ago. Since then, my manager Dale handed me a folded piece of paper during shift change. ""Follow these exactly,"" he said, his usual joking demeanor completely absent. ""Some rules for night shift. Don't ask questions.""

I unfolded the paper in the break room. Seven simple rules written in block letters. Rules I'd never heard of despite working here for three years.

Tonight's my first shift following them. It's 11 PM now, and the black truck just pulled into the lot again.

I pulled the folded paper from my pocket, hands trembling slightly. The rules were written in bold, black ink:

RULE 1: Never serve the customer in the white mask after 3:33 AM.
RULE 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.
RULE 3: The coffee machine in aisle 3 may drip red liquid between 2-4 AM. Clean immediately.
RULE 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.
RULE 5: If you hear whistling from the truck lot, stay inside until it stops.
RULE 6: Lock the cooler doors at exactly midnight. Do not open them until 6 AM.
RULE 7: If the same customer enters more than once in a single shift, only serve them the first time.

The black truck sat motionless under the flickering security light. Through the window, I could see the driver hadn't moved. Same white mask, same wide-brimmed hat. It was 11:47 PM according to the register clock.

I stuffed the rules back into my pocket and tried to focus on normal tasks. The store felt different tonight ‚Äì sounds seemed muffled, like someone had wrapped the building in cotton. Even the usual highway traffic noise faded to a distant whisper.

At exactly midnight, I remembered Rule 6. I walked to the cooler section and turned each lock mechanism. The metallic clicks echoed louder than they should have. As I locked the beer cooler, something rattled inside. Something that definitely wasn't bottles.

Back at the counter, I noticed the security monitors. Twelve screens showing different angles of the store and parking lot. Most displayed normally ‚Äì the bright interior, the scattered cars outside. But Monitor 7, which showed the main entrance, flickered every few seconds. During these flickers, the entrance area appeared different somehow. Older. The floor looked like aged concrete instead of polished tile.

A customer entered at 12:23 AM. Betty Rodriguez, a nurse from the VA hospital in San Antonio. She worked double shifts and always bought the same thing ‚Äì a large coffee and two energy bars. Normal as could be.

""Hey Marcus,"" she said, yawning. ""Quiet night?""

""Pretty much."" I rang up her items. ""Drive safe out there.""

She headed for the door, then paused. ""That truck out there.. is that guy okay? He's been sitting there for like an hour.""

I glanced at the monitors. The black truck remained in the same position. ""Yeah, he's.. taking a break.""

Betty shrugged and left. Through the window, I watched her walk to her Honda Pilot, right past the black truck. She didn't even glance at it, like it wasn't there.

At 1:15 AM, Tommy Chen pulled up in his flame-painted Peterbilt. But when he walked in, something felt off. He moved to the snack aisle and began selecting items: peanuts, a candy bar, chips, crackers, gum, a drink, another drink, cookies, jerky, mints, breath spray, energy bar, and finally a pack of gum ‚Äì thirteen items exactly.

My stomach dropped. Rule 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.

""How's the road tonight, Tommy?"" I asked, scanning his items.

""Roads are different after midnight,"" he said, watching me closely. ""You learning that now?""

The total came to $37.84. I entered a 50% discount, bringing it to $18.92. Tommy nodded approvingly and paid in those strangely crisp bills.

""Good boy,"" he whispered, then left without another word.

The next hour passed uneventfully until I noticed something dripping in aisle 3. The coffee machine ‚Äì the old one they kept running for nostalgic customers ‚Äì was leaking. But the liquid wasn't brown.

It was dark red.

Rule 3 flashed through my mind. I grabbed cleaning supplies and hurried over. The substance looked like coffee but smelled metallic, like pennies mixed with burnt rubber. As I wiped it up, more droplets fell, each landing with a soft plop that echoed strangely.

The cleaning rag soaked up the liquid, turning burgundy. I used three rags before the dripping stopped. Instead of throwing them away, something made me put them in a plastic bag and hide them under the counter. I don't know why.

At 2:17 AM, the automatic doors chimed, and a man in a business suit walked in. Expensive clothes, perfectly groomed, but something nagged at me. I glanced at the security monitors.

Monitor 4 showed him clearly browsing the magazines. Monitor 7 showed the same aisle.

Empty.

No reflection of the man in Monitor 7. Just the magazine rack and empty floor.

Rule 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.

The man approached my counter with a newspaper and a pack of gum. He stood there, waiting. I stared at my hands, focusing on reorganizing the receipt tape, anything to avoid eye contact.

""Excuse me,"" he said. His voice sounded exactly like my father's.

I kept sorting receipts.

""Son, I'd like to buy these items.""

Still Dad's voice. Perfectly reproduced. I gripped the counter edge, knuckles white.

The man waited for two full minutes, then set the items down and walked out. When I looked up, he was gone. The monitors showed him disappearing through the doors, but Monitor 7 had never shown him at all.

3:28 AM. Five minutes before the rule about the masked customer would matter. The black truck hadn't moved. Its driver remained motionless behind the wheel.

I checked the time obsessively. 3:30. 3:31. 3:32.

At exactly 3:33 AM, the truck door opened.

The driver stepped out, straightened their coat, and walked toward the store. Each step seemed perfectly timed, landing on an invisible beat. The automatic doors opened, letting in a rush of cold air that shouldn't exist in October Texas heat.

The figure approached my counter. Up close, the mask looked even stranger ‚Äì too smooth, too white, too perfectly fitted. No breath stirred the material.

They placed three items on the counter: water, crackers, and a banana. Same as before.

According to Rule 1, I couldn't serve them. But they stood there, waiting, while that white mask seemed to bore into my soul.

Time stretched. Seconds felt like minutes. The store's fluorescent lights hummed different tunes, creating harmonies I'd never noticed.

Finally, I spoke: ""I.. I can't help you right now.""

The figure tilted their head, like they'd expected this response. They left the items on the counter and walked away, each step as measured as before.

Through the window, I watched them return to the truck. But instead of driving away, they placed something on my windshield ‚Äì a folded paper tucked under my wiper blade.

The truck then pulled away, disappearing into the Texas night.

At 4 AM, I went outside to retrieve the paper. It was another list of rules, written in the same block letters. But these rules were different.

And they had my name on them.

I unfolded the paper with shaking hands. The handwriting was different this time ‚Äì not block letters, but flowing cursive that looked oddly familiar.

Marcus,
You've done well following the first rules. Now come the real ones. These apply only to you.
PERSONAL RULE 1: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.
PERSONAL RULE 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.
PERSONAL RULE 3: Your shift ends at 6 AM. Do not leave before then, no matter what happens.
PERSONAL RULE 4: The phone behind the counter will ring three times between 4-5 AM. Answer on the fourth ring.
PERSONAL RULE 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

I stared at the paper until the words blurred. How did this person know my mother's voice? How did they know these specific details about my life?

Back inside, I tucked the new rules into my wallet. The store felt heavier now, like the air had thickened into syrup. Every shadow seemed deeper, every reflection distorted.

At 4:07 AM, Miguel arrived in his Ford pickup. But something was wrong. Instead of his usual two energy drinks, jerky, and cigarettes, he bought a single lottery ticket. He paid with a twenty-dollar bill that smelled like flowers.

""You should go home,"" he said quietly, avoiding eye contact. ""This isn't your fight.""

Before I could respond, he walked out, leaving his change on the counter. Through the window, I watched him drive away faster than his truck should have been capable of.

4:23 AM. The phone rang.

Once. Twice. Three times.

I reached for it but stopped. Personal Rule 4: Answer on the fourth ring.

Fourth ring. I picked up.

Static filled the line, punctuated by what sounded like breathing. Then a woman's voice, crackling through interference: ""Baby? Marcus, baby, is that you?""

My mother. Exactly like she sounded before the cancer took her voice. Before the chemotherapy made her whisper. Before she died two years ago.

""I'm so cold, Marcus. I'm trapped in here. Please let me out.""

Personal Rule 1 blazed in my mind: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.

""I know you can hear me,"" the voice continued. ""Remember when you were seven, and you got lost at Zilker Park? I found you by the playground. I promised I'd always find you.""

The voice was perfect. Every inflection, every pause where she'd catch her breath. I started walking toward the back of the store before catching myself.

""Marcus? Please. I'm so cold. Just open the door.""

I hung up.

The silence afterwards felt like judgment. Had I just abandoned my mother's ghost? Or avoided something wearing her voice like a cheap costume?

At 4:45 AM, I noticed something on Monitor 3. A figure walking through the store. Male, average height, wearing the same Buc-ee's uniform I had on.

Me.

I watched myself on the screen, moving through aisles I wasn't in, stocking shelves I hadn't touched. The monitor-me looked tired, older somehow. He moved systematically, efficiently, like someone who'd worked here much longer than three years.

Personal Rule 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.

I forced my gaze to the counter, but peripheral vision caught the monitor-me stopping at the camera, looking directly at it. Direct at me. The face was mine but wrong ‚Äì too pale, eyes too wide, mouth turned down in permanent disappointment.

I kept my head down for ten minutes, reorganizing everything within reach. When I finally glanced back, the monitor showed only empty aisles.

5:15 AM brought Sarah, the trucker from Minnesota. But she looked different. Her usually bright demeanor was gone, replaced by something hollow.

""Marcus, honey,"" she said, her voice strangely formal. ""I've been talking with management. They want me to cover the rest of your shift. You can go home.""

Personal Rule 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

""Thanks, but I'm good. Just an hour left.""

Sarah's smile twitched. ""Come on, you look exhausted. I'll handle everything. Clock out now.""

""Really, I appreciate it, but I need to finish my shift.""

Her expression darkened. ""Marcus, this isn't a request. Management wants you gone. Now.""

""Call Dale if you want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I'm staying until six.""

Something flickered across Sarah's face ‚Äì anger, frustration, then resignation. ""Fine,"" she said. ""But don't say I didn't warn you.""

She left without buying anything, which had never happened before. Through the window, I watched her truck pull away, but the license plates were different. Instead of Minnesota plates, they were blank white rectangles.

5:30 AM. Thirty minutes left.

The store began to change. Subtle at first ‚Äì products on shelves rearranging themselves when I wasn't looking. The Buc-ee's merchandise display shifted from t-shirts to items I didn't recognize: snow globes containing miniature gas stations, keychains shaped like tiny white masks, coffee mugs with my face printed on them.

The security monitors showed increasingly wrong images. Monitor 5 displayed the store from an angle that shouldn't exist, looking down from the ceiling. Monitor 8 showed the parking lot but with different cars ‚Äì vehicles that looked decades old, rusted, some with their doors hanging open.

5:45 AM. I found myself humming a song I'd never heard before, something with seven distinct notes that repeated endlessly. When I realized what I was doing, I bit my tongue hard enough to taste copper.

The automatic doors chimed, and a woman entered. She moved with precise steps, her high heels clicking against the tile in a rhythm that matched my humming. As she approached, I saw her face.

My mother. But not as I remembered her. This version was younger, maybe thirty years old, wearing a white dress that seemed to move independently of any breeze. Her hair was perfect, her skin unmarked by illness.

""Marcus,"" she said, and her voice was exactly as I'd heard on the phone. ""Let's go home together.""

She extended her hand. Her fingernails were painted white, and her wedding ring caught the fluorescent light like a tiny star.

""I'm not ready,"" I whispered.

""You don't have to be. Just take my hand.""

I wanted to. God, I wanted to. The pain of losing her had never faded, just learned to hide better. Here she was, whole and healthy, offering to take away three years of grief.

But something about her eyes was wrong. They held too much knowledge, too much sadness for someone her apparent age. And when she blinked, darkness lingered beneath her eyelids longer than it should.

""I can't,"" I said.

Her expression didn't change, but disappointment radiated from her like heat from asphalt. ""I understand,"" she said softly. ""But I had to try.""

She turned and walked away, her heels echoing with each step. At the door, she looked back.

""I'm proud of you, baby. You're stronger than I was.""

The doors closed behind her. I checked the monitors ‚Äì they showed no trace of her having been here at all.

5:58 AM. Two minutes left.

The store returned to normal with jarring suddenness. Products snapped back to their proper places. Security monitors showed standard views. The oppressive atmosphere lifted like fog burning off in morning sun.

6:00 AM exactly.

Dale walked through the doors in his standard manager uniform, coffee in hand, looking utterly ordinary.

""Morning, Marcus. Quiet night?""

I stared at him, still processing everything that had happened. ""Relatively.""

""Good, good. Go ahead and clock out. Jenny's here for the morning shift.""

I gathered my things slowly, checking the monitors one last time. Everything normal. No sign of the strangeness from the past seven hours.

As I walked to my car, I noticed something on my windshield. Not a note this time, but a single black feather held in place by my wiper blade.

I drove home in silence, but couldn't shake the feeling that tonight had been a test.

And somehow, I'd passed.

I barely slept that day. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the security monitor version of myself staring back, or heard my mother's voice pleading from somewhere cold and dark. By 10 PM, I was back at the store, keys jingling in my shaking hands.

Dale was still there, finishing paperwork. He looked up when I entered, and something passed over his face ‚Äì relief, maybe, or resignation.

""Marcus. Good, you came back.""

""Did you think I wouldn't?""

""After the first night with the rules, some people don't. They find other jobs, leave town, pretend none of it happened."" He stood, gathering his things. ""You did well yesterday. Following them exactly.""

""Where do the rules come from?""

Dale paused at the door. ""That's not for me to say. But I will tell you this ‚Äì everyone who's worked nights here eventually gets their own set. Some people fight them. Those people.."" He shook his head. ""Just follow the rules, Marcus. They're not meant to hurt you.""

He left me alone with questions multiplying like bacteria.

The first few hours passed quietly. Normal customers, normal transactions. Old Miguel came by as always, buying his usual items, but this time he looked me directly in the eye.

""You're still here,"" he said.

""Where else would I be?""

""Some places are doors,"" he said cryptically. ""You chose not to walk through. That means something.""

At 1:30 AM, Tommy Chen arrived, but his truck looked different. The flame paint job was faded, like it had aged decades overnight. He bought exactly thirteen items again, but these were completely different from his usual selections: birthday candles, matches, a bottle of red wine, children's birthday cake mix, vanilla extract, food coloring, plastic forks, paper plates, napkins, a disposable camera, balloons, ribbon, and a congratulations card.

""Whose birthday?"" I asked, applying the half-price discount.

""Mine,"" he said. ""Every night is my birthday now.""

He paid with those crisp bills, but this time I noticed the dates. They were all from 1979. Perfect condition, like they'd been printed yesterday.

""How long have you been doing this run, Tommy?""

He smiled, and I saw his teeth were wrong ‚Äì too white, too uniform, like dentures made for someone else's mouth. ""Since my truck was new. Since this stretch of highway opened. Since they built this store."" He gathered his bags. ""Some of us chose to stay in the loop. Others get chosen for it.""

After he left, I found myself checking the local traffic reports on the computer. Highway 35 through this section had been completed in 1967. Buc-ee's had opened this location in 1982. Tommy's truck was a 1979 model.

The math didn't work.

2:47 AM brought an unusual customer ‚Äì a woman in her sixties wearing a Lubbock High School class ring and carrying a purse that looked like it belonged in a museum. She moved slowly, methodically, selecting items with the kind of precision that suggested ritual.

She bought seven items: a bottle of water, a bag of peanuts, a candy bar, a local newspaper, a pen, an envelope, and stamps. At the counter, she opened the newspaper, read something that made her frown, then wrote a short letter. She sealed it in the envelope, addressed it in careful cursive, and applied a stamp.

""Could you mail this for me, honey?"" she asked, handing me the letter.

The address read: Marcus Chen, Buc-ee's Travel Plaza, Highway 35, Austin, Texas

My address. My name. But the last name was wrong.

""Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake. This has my first name, but‚Äî""

""No mistake,"" she said firmly. ""You'll understand when you need to.""

She left cash on the counter and walked out. Through the window, I watched her get into a car that looked like it was from the 1950s, mint condition but somehow dusty. The license plate read ""MEMORY.""

I held the letter up to the light. Inside, I could make out handwriting, but couldn't read the words. Something told me not to open it yet.

At 3:15 AM, the coffee machine in aisle 3 started dripping again. Red liquid, same as before. But this time, I noticed something else. The droplets weren't random ‚Äì they were forming a pattern on the floor. Letters.

MARCUS

I cleaned it quickly, but the letters reappeared immediately. Different this time.

YOUR TURN

I cleaned again. The droplets stopped, but a new message had formed:

C H O O S E

The automatic doors chimed. I looked up to see someone in a Buc-ee's uniform walking in. Male, my height, my build. As he got closer, I realized with growing horror that it was me. Exactly me, down to the small scar on my left hand from a childhood accident.

But this version looked tired in a way that went beyond losing sleep. His eyes held a weariness that seemed to span years. He moved like someone who'd been walking the same path for far too long.

""Finally,"" he said, his voice exactly mine but somehow older. ""I was wondering when you'd show up.""

The security monitors didn't show him at all.

""Personal Rule 2,"" I whispered. ""Don't look at myself in the monitors.""

""Smart,"" the other me said. ""But this isn't a monitor, is it? This is face to face.""

""What do you want?""

""To go home. To sleep. To stop walking this loop."" He gestured around the store. ""Do you know how long I've been here? How many nights I've served the same customers, followed the same rules, pretended everything was normal?""

""I don't understand.""

""You will. See, here's the thing about loops, Marcus. Someone has to walk them. Someone has to keep the store running, serve the customers who aren't quite customers, follow rules that aren't quite rules."" He smiled, and it was my smile but wrong. ""I've done my time. Now it's your turn.""

""That's not how it works.""

""Isn't it? Look at Tommy Chen. Look at Miguel. Look at everyone who comes here regularly. We're all in loops, Marcus. The question is whether you choose yours willingly or get trapped in it accidentally.""

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. My keys, but these were tarnished, worn smooth by endless use.

""Take them. Take my place. I'll walk out that door, and you'll never see me again. You'll work the night shift forever, but you'll be part of something bigger. Something that keeps the balance.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Then we'll keep running into each other. Night after night. Until one of us breaks or until you finally understand that this is inevitable.""

I stared at the keys. They seemed heavier than they should, like they were made of something denser than metal.

""Why me?""

""Because you followed the rules. Because when the loop tested you ‚Äì with your mother, with your own reflection, with every temptation to leave early ‚Äì you stayed. That kind of dedication is rare. The others who work here, they're just doing a job. You're doing something more.""

The clock above the register read 3:33 AM.

The doors chimed again. The black truck driver entered, still wearing that white mask. But now I could see through it, see the face underneath.

It was Dale. My manager Dale, but decades younger.

""Time to choose, Marcus,"" Dale's voice came from behind the mask. ""Tommy chose his truck and his eternal run. Miguel chose his Tuesday routine. The lady with the letter chose to remember things that were lost.""

""What about you?""

""I chose to manage this place. To guide each new night shift worker through their first encounters with the rules. To make sure the balance is maintained.""

The other me stepped closer. ""It's not a bad existence, Marcus. You'll get to help people. Strange people, people caught between worlds, but people nonetheless. You'll be part of a network that spans the highways, the truck stops, the spaces between normal places.""

""And if I walk away? Now?""

Dale answered: ""Then someone else will take your place. Someone who might not follow the rules as well. Someone who might let the balance tip.""

I looked at the letter in my hand. The woman had said I'd understand when I needed to. Now felt like the time. I opened it.

The handwriting was shaky but clear:

""Marcus, my dear grandson. If you're reading this, you've found your place in the web. Your grandmother chose to remember the highways as they were, before they became something else. Your grandfather chose his truck and his route. Now you must choose your role. There's no shame in walking away, but remember ‚Äì everyone connected to this place has a part to play. Choose wisely. With love, Grandma Chen.""

Chen. Like Tommy Chen. Like the address on the envelope.

""Tommy is my grandfather,"" I said, understanding flooding through me.

""Was,"" Dale corrected. ""Now he's something else. Something that maintains the connections between places like this. The questions is: what do you want to become?""

The other me held out the keys again. They caught the fluorescent light and seemed to pulse with their own inner glow.

""I need time to think.""

""You have until dawn,"" Dale said. ""But remember ‚Äì the choice will be made one way or another. The loop needs someone to walk it.""

4:00 AM. Two hours left.

I slipped the letter into my pocket next to the rules. The other me sat down behind the counter, and for a moment, we were both there, two versions of the same person separated by time and choices.

""It's peaceful, mostly,"" he said. ""The customers are rarely hostile. The rules make sense once you understand what they're protecting. And you get to be part of something larger than yourself.""

""But I'll never leave.""

""Define leaving. Your body will stay here, but your purpose will extend across every highway, every truck stop, every place where the strange travelers need shelter.""

Outside, the black truck waited patiently, its driver watching through dark windows.

The choice was mine.

But first, I had to survive the rest of the night.

The next hour passed in surreal calm. My other self sat behind the counter, humming that seven-note tune I'd caught myself singing the night before. He seemed content, almost meditative, like someone who'd finally found peace after a long struggle.

Dale removed his mask and hung it on a hook behind the register I'd never noticed before. Without it, he looked ordinary ‚Äì tired middle management, graying hair, coffee stains on his shirt. But his eyes held depths that spoke of years spent managing more than just a convenience store.

""You have questions,"" he said.

""Thousands.""

""Ask the important ones. Time's limited.""

""How long has this been going on?""

""Depends how you measure. The network of strange travelers has existed since the first roads connected distant places. But this specific location? Since 1982, when we opened. That's when the confluence became strong enough to require management.""

""Confluence?""

""Places where different realities touch. Highway intersections, truck stops, airports ‚Äì anywhere people from different worlds might meet. Most are minor, barely noticeable. This one's significant enough to need rules.""

A customer entered ‚Äì a young woman in scrubs, probably coming off a hospital shift. She moved normally, bought coffee and a breakfast burrito normally, paid with a normal credit card. When she left, I realized how much I'd missed ordinary interactions.

""Not everyone who comes here is.. strange?"" I asked.

""Most aren't,"" Dale said. ""Maybe one in twenty are traveling between places that don't quite exist. But their presence affects everything. Like drops of food coloring in water ‚Äì you need very little to change the whole glass.""

My other self spoke up: ""The rules exist to keep both types of customers safe. Normal people need protection from seeing too much. The others need protection from being seen too clearly.""

""What happens to people who break the rules?""

Dale's expression darkened. ""Depends on the rule. Minor ones, like serving the masked customer after 3:33, just create.. complications. Major ones can unravel someone's connection to their original reality. They become like Tommy, or Miguel, or any of the regulars. Stuck in loops, serving a function in the network.""

""And they're happy?""

""Happy might not be the right word. They're fulfilled. They have purpose. But they can't leave.""

Another customer entered ‚Äì an elderly man in overalls, buying motor oil and a pack of crackers. Normal transaction, normal interaction. But when he left, I noticed his pickup truck had no license plate at all, just a blank metal rectangle.

""How many people like you are there? Managing these places?""

""Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Every major truck stop has someone. Most airports. Some train stations. Anywhere travelers gather, especially at night."" Dale checked his watch. ""We're recruited based on our ability to follow instructions precisely and adapt to unusual circumstances.""

""Recruited?""

""You think I applied for this job through Indeed?"" He smiled grimly. ""I was working nights at a gas station outside Amarillo fifteen years ago. Different rules, same basic situation. When I proved capable, I was offered a promotion. Better pay, better benefits, but the work never stops.""

My other self stood and stretched. ""It's not as bad as it sounds, Marcus. You'll find rhythms. Patterns. The strange customers become familiar. You'll look forward to Tommy's stories, Miguel's silent nods, even the coffee machine's color changes.""

""But I'll never see my family again. My friends.""

""You'll see them,"" Dale said. ""Just differently. Time moves strangely in the network. A night here might be minutes in the outside world, or it might be days. You'll age slower. Your relationships will.. adjust.""

5:17 AM. Less than an hour left to decide.

""Can I visit other locations? See other parts of this network?""

""Eventually. After you've proven stable, you can travel between nodes. Meet other managers, other chosen workers. Some people enjoy the community aspect.""

A phone rang ‚Äì not the store phone, but a cell phone in Dale's pocket. He answered quickly.

""Yes? .. I see .. How many? .. Understood.""

He hung up and looked troubled.

""Problem?""

""There's been an incident in Oklahoma. A night manager broke protocol, tried to document everything with a camera. The local confluence is destabilizing. We might need to relocate some of the travelers.""

""Relocate?""

""People like Tommy, Miguel, the letter lady. Sometimes they need to move between locations to maintain balance. It's disruptive but necessary.""

The doors chimed, and a familiar figure entered ‚Äì the woman who'd given me the letter. But she looked different now, younger, wearing modern clothes instead of vintage ones.

""Mrs.Chen,"" Dale greeted her. ""Is it time?""

""Nearly,"" she said, approaching the counter. She smiled at me, and I could see the family resemblance clearly now. ""Hello, grandson.""

""You're really my grandmother?""

""Was. Am. Will be. Time isn't linear in the network."" She patted my hand. ""I chose to remember our family's connections to these places. Your grandfather chose to maintain them through his traveling. Now you have the opportunity to guard them.""

""The letter you had me write,"" she continued, addressing Dale, ""it went through?""

""This morning. The Vancouver location confirmed receipt. They're prepared.""

She turned back to me. ""Your cousin David works the night shift at a truck stop outside Seattle. Same situation, same choice. Family often finds its way to these positions. We're drawn to them.""

My other self checked the clock. ""Thirty-seven minutes left.""

""What happens if I choose to leave?"" I asked.

Dale sighed. ""Then we find someone else. But transitions are difficult. The customers sense changes in management. Some of them don't handle it well. And honestly, Marcus, you're already deeply involved. The rules have been working through you for two nights. That connection isn't easy to sever.""

""Meaning?""

""You might leave physically, but part of you would remain here. You'd find yourself driving past at odd hours, remembering customers you'd never met, humming songs you'd never heard. It would pull at you until you either came back or went mad.""

""That's not really a choice, then.""

""It's as much choice as anyone gets in life,"" my grandmother said gently. ""The question isn't whether you'll be part of something larger than yourself. Everyone is, in some way. The question is whether you'll choose your role consciously or let it happen to you.""

Another customer entered ‚Äì a trucker I'd never seen before, buying supplies for the road. But as he paid, I noticed his name tag: ""David Chen.""

My cousin. But this version looked older, wearier, like he'd been traveling much longer than any normal person should.

""Marcus?"" He looked surprised to see me. ""I didn't know you were working here.""

""Just started the night shift.""

""Ah."" Understanding flickered in his eyes. ""Your time to choose, then. It's not a bad life, cousin. Lonely sometimes, but meaningful. You'll help people who have nowhere else to go.""

He bought a coffee and a map of highways that didn't match any road atlas I'd ever seen. The routes were labeled with names like ""The Dreaming Path"" and ""Connection Avenue.""

""Maybe I'll see you around the network,"" he said, then left.

""How many family members are involved in this?""

""More than you might think,"" Grandmother Chen said. ""Your aunt runs a diner in New Mexico that serves similar functions. Your uncle manages a motel in Montana. We've been maintaining these connections for generations.""

5:45 AM. Fifteen minutes.

My other self took the keys from his pocket again. ""Last chance, Marcus. I've been doing this for.. I've lost track of how long. But I've helped thousands of travelers find what they needed. Some were lost souls looking for peace. Others were beings from different realities seeking safe passage. All needed someone to follow the rules, maintain the balance.""

""And if I take your place, you're free?""

""Free to move on. To whatever comes next for people like us.""

Dale nodded. ""The network doesn't trap people forever. When your replacement is ready, you'll have options. Some choose to move to higher positions ‚Äì managing multiple locations, coordinating between regions. Others choose to step outside reality entirely.""

""What does that mean?""

""Hard to explain. But some former managers become something like guardian spirits for the entire network. They exist in the spaces between spaces, helping when things go wrong.""

The clock showed 5:50 AM.

Ten minutes.

I looked at the keys in my other self's hand. They seemed heavier now, weighted with responsibility and possibility.

""Marcus,"" Dale said quietly, ""understand this isn't just about you. The network needs people it can trust. People who'll follow rules not out of fear, but out of understanding. You've proven you can do that.""

""And if I screw up?""

""Then we'll help you fix it. That's what the network is for.""

5:55 AM.

Five minutes.

My grandmother squeezed my hand. ""Whatever you choose, I'm proud of you. You've honored our family's legacy just by being here.""

The automatic doors were silent. No more customers would come before dawn.

Four minutes.

I picked up the keys.

The keys felt warm in my palm, like they'd been held by someone for a very long time. Three minutes left.

""I need to know something,"" I said to my other self. ""When did you start? What year?""

He smiled sadly. ""2021. Three years ago, your time.""

""That's impossible. I started working here three years ago.""

""Time isn't linear in the network, Marcus. I'm you from another possibility. A version where you said yes the first night you were offered the choice. Where you took the keys immediately.""

Dale nodded. ""Sometimes the network shows people their alternative paths. Usually, it helps with the decision.""

""So he's not my replacement. He's what I become if I say yes?""

""One version of it,"" my other self confirmed. ""I've seen different paths too. A Marcus who became a regional coordinator, moving between dozen of locations. Another who chose the guardian path and became something that exists between realities. And one who walked away.""

""What happened to the one who walked away?""

The room grew cold. Outside, I could hear wind that hadn't been there before.

1kooz14,https://www.reddit.com/r/rulestofollow/comments/1kooz14/im_a_night_shift_worker_at_bucees_gas_station_in/,"I'm a Night Shift Worker at Buc-ee's GAS STATION IN RURAL TEXAS, There are STRANGE RULES to follow ! (Part 2 )","I never thought I'd still be working the graveyard shift at Buc-ee's on Highway 35, thirty miles south of Austin. My name's Marcus, and I've been manning this particular outpost for three years now. The massive travel center sits like a neon beacon in the darkness, drawing every kind of traveler you can imagine across the Texas landscape.

During daylight hours, families pile out of minivans loaded with coolers and kids, grabbing the famous brisket sandwiches and those overpriced beaver nuggets. But nights? That's when you meet the real Texas. Long-haul truckers pulling double trailers filled with everything from cattle to computer parts. Ranch hands driving dusty F-250s with livestock trailers, heading to auction in San Antonio. Weekend warriors in lifted Chevy Silverados, their beds stuffed with camping gear and beer coolers.

There's old Miguel, who stops every Tuesday around 2 AM in his weathered Ford pickup, buying the same exact items: two energy drinks, a bag of beef jerky, and a pack of Marlboro Reds. He tips his hat but never speaks, just nods and disappears back onto the highway. Then there's Sarah, a trucker from Minnesota who hauls frozen foods down to Mexico. She's got a mouth like a sailor and tells the best road stories I've ever heard while she waits for her logbook hours to reset.

The strangest regular is probably Tommy Chen, who drives an immaculate 1979 Peterbilt with hand-painted flames down the sides. He claims he's been driving these highways since before I was born, which would make him impossibly old based on how young he looks. Tommy only stops during the deepest part of night, always buys exactly thirteen items, and pays in cash that looks like it's fresh from the mint.

But last Thursday, something different rolled into our lot. I was restocking the coffee station around 3:30 AM when headlights swept across the windows in an odd pattern ‚Äì not the usual steady approach of a truck or car. This vehicle seemed to pause, then advance, pause again, like it was.. considering.

A massive black pickup truck finally parked under the far edge of our lighting. Not black like most trucks you see on the road, but black like the space between stars. The kind of black that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. No license plate visible from where I stood. No mud, no road dust, no scratches ‚Äì unusual for any vehicle that's spent time on Texas highways.

The driver sat motionless for nearly ten minutes. Through the tinted windshield, I could make out only the outline of someone wearing what looked like a wide-brimmed hat pulled low. No movement, no engine noise after parking. Just stillness.

Finally, the door opened with a soft click that somehow carried all the way to the store. The driver emerged slowly, wearing a long coat despite the October heat. What caught my attention wasn't the coat or the hat, though. It was the mask.

A simple white medical mask, the kind everyone wore during covid, but something about it felt wrong. Maybe it was how perfectly clean it looked, or how it seemed to catch the fluorescent light in a way that made it almost glow. The driver ‚Äì I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman ‚Äì walked with measured steps toward the entrance, never looking left or right, never acknowledging the security cameras.

I pretended to be busy with inventory as they entered. The automatic doors chimed their usual welcome, but the sound felt flat, muffled somehow. The person moved through the aisles without making any noise ‚Äì no footsteps on the polished floor, no rustle of clothing. They selected items methodically: a bottle of water, a package of crackers, and a single banana. Nothing else.

At the counter, they placed exact change on the surface without speaking. As I rang up the items, I tried to make eye contact, but the mask and hat cast shadows that seemed deeper than they should.

""Have a good night,"" I said, handing over the receipt.

They tilted their head slightly, like an animal listening to a distant sound, then walked out the same deliberate way they'd entered. The truck started without any engine noise I could hear and pulled away, taillights disappearing into the darkness of Highway 35.

That was five days ago. Since then, my manager Dale handed me a folded piece of paper during shift change. ""Follow these exactly,"" he said, his usual joking demeanor completely absent. ""Some rules for night shift. Don't ask questions.""

I unfolded the paper in the break room. Seven simple rules written in block letters. Rules I'd never heard of despite working here for three years.

Tonight's my first shift following them. It's 11 PM now, and the black truck just pulled into the lot again.

I pulled the folded paper from my pocket, hands trembling slightly. The rules were written in bold, black ink:

RULE 1: Never serve the customer in the white mask after 3:33 AM.
RULE 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.
RULE 3: The coffee machine in aisle 3 may drip red liquid between 2-4 AM. Clean immediately.
RULE 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.
RULE 5: If you hear whistling from the truck lot, stay inside until it stops.
RULE 6: Lock the cooler doors at exactly midnight. Do not open them until 6 AM.
RULE 7: If the same customer enters more than once in a single shift, only serve them the first time.

The black truck sat motionless under the flickering security light. Through the window, I could see the driver hadn't moved. Same white mask, same wide-brimmed hat. It was 11:47 PM according to the register clock.

I stuffed the rules back into my pocket and tried to focus on normal tasks. The store felt different tonight ‚Äì sounds seemed muffled, like someone had wrapped the building in cotton. Even the usual highway traffic noise faded to a distant whisper.

At exactly midnight, I remembered Rule 6. I walked to the cooler section and turned each lock mechanism. The metallic clicks echoed louder than they should have. As I locked the beer cooler, something rattled inside. Something that definitely wasn't bottles.

Back at the counter, I noticed the security monitors. Twelve screens showing different angles of the store and parking lot. Most displayed normally ‚Äì the bright interior, the scattered cars outside. But Monitor 7, which showed the main entrance, flickered every few seconds. During these flickers, the entrance area appeared different somehow. Older. The floor looked like aged concrete instead of polished tile.

A customer entered at 12:23 AM. Betty Rodriguez, a nurse from the VA hospital in San Antonio. She worked double shifts and always bought the same thing ‚Äì a large coffee and two energy bars. Normal as could be.

""Hey Marcus,"" she said, yawning. ""Quiet night?""

""Pretty much."" I rang up her items. ""Drive safe out there.""

She headed for the door, then paused. ""That truck out there.. is that guy okay? He's been sitting there for like an hour.""

I glanced at the monitors. The black truck remained in the same position. ""Yeah, he's.. taking a break.""

Betty shrugged and left. Through the window, I watched her walk to her Honda Pilot, right past the black truck. She didn't even glance at it, like it wasn't there.

At 1:15 AM, Tommy Chen pulled up in his flame-painted Peterbilt. But when he walked in, something felt off. He moved to the snack aisle and began selecting items: peanuts, a candy bar, chips, crackers, gum, a drink, another drink, cookies, jerky, mints, breath spray, energy bar, and finally a pack of gum ‚Äì thirteen items exactly.

My stomach dropped. Rule 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.

""How's the road tonight, Tommy?"" I asked, scanning his items.

""Roads are different after midnight,"" he said, watching me closely. ""You learning that now?""

The total came to $37.84. I entered a 50% discount, bringing it to $18.92. Tommy nodded approvingly and paid in those strangely crisp bills.

""Good boy,"" he whispered, then left without another word.

The next hour passed uneventfully until I noticed something dripping in aisle 3. The coffee machine ‚Äì the old one they kept running for nostalgic customers ‚Äì was leaking. But the liquid wasn't brown.

It was dark red.

Rule 3 flashed through my mind. I grabbed cleaning supplies and hurried over. The substance looked like coffee but smelled metallic, like pennies mixed with burnt rubber. As I wiped it up, more droplets fell, each landing with a soft plop that echoed strangely.

The cleaning rag soaked up the liquid, turning burgundy. I used three rags before the dripping stopped. Instead of throwing them away, something made me put them in a plastic bag and hide them under the counter. I don't know why.

At 2:17 AM, the automatic doors chimed, and a man in a business suit walked in. Expensive clothes, perfectly groomed, but something nagged at me. I glanced at the security monitors.

Monitor 4 showed him clearly browsing the magazines. Monitor 7 showed the same aisle.

Empty.

No reflection of the man in Monitor 7. Just the magazine rack and empty floor.

Rule 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.

The man approached my counter with a newspaper and a pack of gum. He stood there, waiting. I stared at my hands, focusing on reorganizing the receipt tape, anything to avoid eye contact.

""Excuse me,"" he said. His voice sounded exactly like my father's.

I kept sorting receipts.

""Son, I'd like to buy these items.""

Still Dad's voice. Perfectly reproduced. I gripped the counter edge, knuckles white.

The man waited for two full minutes, then set the items down and walked out. When I looked up, he was gone. The monitors showed him disappearing through the doors, but Monitor 7 had never shown him at all.

3:28 AM. Five minutes before the rule about the masked customer would matter. The black truck hadn't moved. Its driver remained motionless behind the wheel.

I checked the time obsessively. 3:30. 3:31. 3:32.

At exactly 3:33 AM, the truck door opened.

The driver stepped out, straightened their coat, and walked toward the store. Each step seemed perfectly timed, landing on an invisible beat. The automatic doors opened, letting in a rush of cold air that shouldn't exist in October Texas heat.

The figure approached my counter. Up close, the mask looked even stranger ‚Äì too smooth, too white, too perfectly fitted. No breath stirred the material.

They placed three items on the counter: water, crackers, and a banana. Same as before.

According to Rule 1, I couldn't serve them. But they stood there, waiting, while that white mask seemed to bore into my soul.

Time stretched. Seconds felt like minutes. The store's fluorescent lights hummed different tunes, creating harmonies I'd never noticed.

Finally, I spoke: ""I.. I can't help you right now.""

The figure tilted their head, like they'd expected this response. They left the items on the counter and walked away, each step as measured as before.

Through the window, I watched them return to the truck. But instead of driving away, they placed something on my windshield ‚Äì a folded paper tucked under my wiper blade.

The truck then pulled away, disappearing into the Texas night.

At 4 AM, I went outside to retrieve the paper. It was another list of rules, written in the same block letters. But these rules were different.

And they had my name on them.

I unfolded the paper with shaking hands. The handwriting was different this time ‚Äì not block letters, but flowing cursive that looked oddly familiar.

Marcus,
You've done well following the first rules. Now come the real ones. These apply only to you.
PERSONAL RULE 1: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.
PERSONAL RULE 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.
PERSONAL RULE 3: Your shift ends at 6 AM. Do not leave before then, no matter what happens.
PERSONAL RULE 4: The phone behind the counter will ring three times between 4-5 AM. Answer on the fourth ring.
PERSONAL RULE 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

I stared at the paper until the words blurred. How did this person know my mother's voice? How did they know these specific details about my life?

Back inside, I tucked the new rules into my wallet. The store felt heavier now, like the air had thickened into syrup. Every shadow seemed deeper, every reflection distorted.

At 4:07 AM, Miguel arrived in his Ford pickup. But something was wrong. Instead of his usual two energy drinks, jerky, and cigarettes, he bought a single lottery ticket. He paid with a twenty-dollar bill that smelled like flowers.

""You should go home,"" he said quietly, avoiding eye contact. ""This isn't your fight.""

Before I could respond, he walked out, leaving his change on the counter. Through the window, I watched him drive away faster than his truck should have been capable of.

4:23 AM. The phone rang.

Once. Twice. Three times.

I reached for it but stopped. Personal Rule 4: Answer on the fourth ring.

Fourth ring. I picked up.

Static filled the line, punctuated by what sounded like breathing. Then a woman's voice, crackling through interference: ""Baby? Marcus, baby, is that you?""

My mother. Exactly like she sounded before the cancer took her voice. Before the chemotherapy made her whisper. Before she died two years ago.

""I'm so cold, Marcus. I'm trapped in here. Please let me out.""

Personal Rule 1 blazed in my mind: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.

""I know you can hear me,"" the voice continued. ""Remember when you were seven, and you got lost at Zilker Park? I found you by the playground. I promised I'd always find you.""

The voice was perfect. Every inflection, every pause where she'd catch her breath. I started walking toward the back of the store before catching myself.

""Marcus? Please. I'm so cold. Just open the door.""

I hung up.

The silence afterwards felt like judgment. Had I just abandoned my mother's ghost? Or avoided something wearing her voice like a cheap costume?

At 4:45 AM, I noticed something on Monitor 3. A figure walking through the store. Male, average height, wearing the same Buc-ee's uniform I had on.

Me.

I watched myself on the screen, moving through aisles I wasn't in, stocking shelves I hadn't touched. The monitor-me looked tired, older somehow. He moved systematically, efficiently, like someone who'd worked here much longer than three years.

Personal Rule 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.

I forced my gaze to the counter, but peripheral vision caught the monitor-me stopping at the camera, looking directly at it. Direct at me. The face was mine but wrong ‚Äì too pale, eyes too wide, mouth turned down in permanent disappointment.

I kept my head down for ten minutes, reorganizing everything within reach. When I finally glanced back, the monitor showed only empty aisles.

5:15 AM brought Sarah, the trucker from Minnesota. But she looked different. Her usually bright demeanor was gone, replaced by something hollow.

""Marcus, honey,"" she said, her voice strangely formal. ""I've been talking with management. They want me to cover the rest of your shift. You can go home.""

Personal Rule 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

""Thanks, but I'm good. Just an hour left.""

Sarah's smile twitched. ""Come on, you look exhausted. I'll handle everything. Clock out now.""

""Really, I appreciate it, but I need to finish my shift.""

Her expression darkened. ""Marcus, this isn't a request. Management wants you gone. Now.""

""Call Dale if you want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I'm staying until six.""

Something flickered across Sarah's face ‚Äì anger, frustration, then resignation. ""Fine,"" she said. ""But don't say I didn't warn you.""

She left without buying anything, which had never happened before. Through the window, I watched her truck pull away, but the license plates were different. Instead of Minnesota plates, they were blank white rectangles.

5:30 AM. Thirty minutes left.

The store began to change. Subtle at first ‚Äì products on shelves rearranging themselves when I wasn't looking. The Buc-ee's merchandise display shifted from t-shirts to items I didn't recognize: snow globes containing miniature gas stations, keychains shaped like tiny white masks, coffee mugs with my face printed on them.

The security monitors showed increasingly wrong images. Monitor 5 displayed the store from an angle that shouldn't exist, looking down from the ceiling. Monitor 8 showed the parking lot but with different cars ‚Äì vehicles that looked decades old, rusted, some with their doors hanging open.

5:45 AM. I found myself humming a song I'd never heard before, something with seven distinct notes that repeated endlessly. When I realized what I was doing, I bit my tongue hard enough to taste copper.

The automatic doors chimed, and a woman entered. She moved with precise steps, her high heels clicking against the tile in a rhythm that matched my humming. As she approached, I saw her face.

My mother. But not as I remembered her. This version was younger, maybe thirty years old, wearing a white dress that seemed to move independently of any breeze. Her hair was perfect, her skin unmarked by illness.

""Marcus,"" she said, and her voice was exactly as I'd heard on the phone. ""Let's go home together.""

She extended her hand. Her fingernails were painted white, and her wedding ring caught the fluorescent light like a tiny star.

""I'm not ready,"" I whispered.

""You don't have to be. Just take my hand.""

I wanted to. God, I wanted to. The pain of losing her had never faded, just learned to hide better. Here she was, whole and healthy, offering to take away three years of grief.

But something about her eyes was wrong. They held too much knowledge, too much sadness for someone her apparent age. And when she blinked, darkness lingered beneath her eyelids longer than it should.

""I can't,"" I said.

Her expression didn't change, but disappointment radiated from her like heat from asphalt. ""I understand,"" she said softly. ""But I had to try.""

She turned and walked away, her heels echoing with each step. At the door, she looked back.

""I'm proud of you, baby. You're stronger than I was.""

The doors closed behind her. I checked the monitors ‚Äì they showed no trace of her having been here at all.

5:58 AM. Two minutes left.

The store returned to normal with jarring suddenness. Products snapped back to their proper places. Security monitors showed standard views. The oppressive atmosphere lifted like fog burning off in morning sun.

6:00 AM exactly.

Dale walked through the doors in his standard manager uniform, coffee in hand, looking utterly ordinary.

""Morning, Marcus. Quiet night?""

I stared at him, still processing everything that had happened. ""Relatively.""

""Good, good. Go ahead and clock out. Jenny's here for the morning shift.""

I gathered my things slowly, checking the monitors one last time. Everything normal. No sign of the strangeness from the past seven hours.

As I walked to my car, I noticed something on my windshield. Not a note this time, but a single black feather held in place by my wiper blade.

I drove home in silence, but couldn't shake the feeling that tonight had been a test.

And somehow, I'd passed.

I barely slept that day. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the security monitor version of myself staring back, or heard my mother's voice pleading from somewhere cold and dark. By 10 PM, I was back at the store, keys jingling in my shaking hands.

Dale was still there, finishing paperwork. He looked up when I entered, and something passed over his face ‚Äì relief, maybe, or resignation.

""Marcus. Good, you came back.""

""Did you think I wouldn't?""

""After the first night with the rules, some people don't. They find other jobs, leave town, pretend none of it happened."" He stood, gathering his things. ""You did well yesterday. Following them exactly.""

""Where do the rules come from?""

Dale paused at the door. ""That's not for me to say. But I will tell you this ‚Äì everyone who's worked nights here eventually gets their own set. Some people fight them. Those people.."" He shook his head. ""Just follow the rules, Marcus. They're not meant to hurt you.""

He left me alone with questions multiplying like bacteria.

The first few hours passed quietly. Normal customers, normal transactions. Old Miguel came by as always, buying his usual items, but this time he looked me directly in the eye.

""You're still here,"" he said.

""Where else would I be?""

""Some places are doors,"" he said cryptically. ""You chose not to walk through. That means something.""

At 1:30 AM, Tommy Chen arrived, but his truck looked different. The flame paint job was faded, like it had aged decades overnight. He bought exactly thirteen items again, but these were completely different from his usual selections: birthday candles, matches, a bottle of red wine, children's birthday cake mix, vanilla extract, food coloring, plastic forks, paper plates, napkins, a disposable camera, balloons, ribbon, and a congratulations card.

""Whose birthday?"" I asked, applying the half-price discount.

""Mine,"" he said. ""Every night is my birthday now.""

He paid with those crisp bills, but this time I noticed the dates. They were all from 1979. Perfect condition, like they'd been printed yesterday.

""How long have you been doing this run, Tommy?""

He smiled, and I saw his teeth were wrong ‚Äì too white, too uniform, like dentures made for someone else's mouth. ""Since my truck was new. Since this stretch of highway opened. Since they built this store."" He gathered his bags. ""Some of us chose to stay in the loop. Others get chosen for it.""

After he left, I found myself checking the local traffic reports on the computer. Highway 35 through this section had been completed in 1967. Buc-ee's had opened this location in 1982. Tommy's truck was a 1979 model.

The math didn't work.

2:47 AM brought an unusual customer ‚Äì a woman in her sixties wearing a Lubbock High School class ring and carrying a purse that looked like it belonged in a museum. She moved slowly, methodically, selecting items with the kind of precision that suggested ritual.

She bought seven items: a bottle of water, a bag of peanuts, a candy bar, a local newspaper, a pen, an envelope, and stamps. At the counter, she opened the newspaper, read something that made her frown, then wrote a short letter. She sealed it in the envelope, addressed it in careful cursive, and applied a stamp.

""Could you mail this for me, honey?"" she asked, handing me the letter.

The address read: Marcus Chen, Buc-ee's Travel Plaza, Highway 35, Austin, Texas

My address. My name. But the last name was wrong.

""Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake. This has my first name, but‚Äî""

""No mistake,"" she said firmly. ""You'll understand when you need to.""

She left cash on the counter and walked out. Through the window, I watched her get into a car that looked like it was from the 1950s, mint condition but somehow dusty. The license plate read ""MEMORY.""

I held the letter up to the light. Inside, I could make out handwriting, but couldn't read the words. Something told me not to open it yet.

At 3:15 AM, the coffee machine in aisle 3 started dripping again. Red liquid, same as before. But this time, I noticed something else. The droplets weren't random ‚Äì they were forming a pattern on the floor. Letters.

MARCUS

I cleaned it quickly, but the letters reappeared immediately. Different this time.

YOUR TURN

I cleaned again. The droplets stopped, but a new message had formed:

C H O O S E

The automatic doors chimed. I looked up to see someone in a Buc-ee's uniform walking in. Male, my height, my build. As he got closer, I realized with growing horror that it was me. Exactly me, down to the small scar on my left hand from a childhood accident.

But this version looked tired in a way that went beyond losing sleep. His eyes held a weariness that seemed to span years. He moved like someone who'd been walking the same path for far too long.

""Finally,"" he said, his voice exactly mine but somehow older. ""I was wondering when you'd show up.""

The security monitors didn't show him at all.

""Personal Rule 2,"" I whispered. ""Don't look at myself in the monitors.""

""Smart,"" the other me said. ""But this isn't a monitor, is it? This is face to face.""

""What do you want?""

""To go home. To sleep. To stop walking this loop."" He gestured around the store. ""Do you know how long I've been here? How many nights I've served the same customers, followed the same rules, pretended everything was normal?""

""I don't understand.""

""You will. See, here's the thing about loops, Marcus. Someone has to walk them. Someone has to keep the store running, serve the customers who aren't quite customers, follow rules that aren't quite rules."" He smiled, and it was my smile but wrong. ""I've done my time. Now it's your turn.""

""That's not how it works.""

""Isn't it? Look at Tommy Chen. Look at Miguel. Look at everyone who comes here regularly. We're all in loops, Marcus. The question is whether you choose yours willingly or get trapped in it accidentally.""

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. My keys, but these were tarnished, worn smooth by endless use.

""Take them. Take my place. I'll walk out that door, and you'll never see me again. You'll work the night shift forever, but you'll be part of something bigger. Something that keeps the balance.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Then we'll keep running into each other. Night after night. Until one of us breaks or until you finally understand that this is inevitable.""

I stared at the keys. They seemed heavier than they should, like they were made of something denser than metal.

""Why me?""

""Because you followed the rules. Because when the loop tested you ‚Äì with your mother, with your own reflection, with every temptation to leave early ‚Äì you stayed. That kind of dedication is rare. The others who work here, they're just doing a job. You're doing something more.""

The clock above the register read 3:33 AM.

The doors chimed again. The black truck driver entered, still wearing that white mask. But now I could see through it, see the face underneath.

It was Dale. My manager Dale, but decades younger.

""Time to choose, Marcus,"" Dale's voice came from behind the mask. ""Tommy chose his truck and his eternal run. Miguel chose his Tuesday routine. The lady with the letter chose to remember things that were lost.""

""What about you?""

""I chose to manage this place. To guide each new night shift worker through their first encounters with the rules. To make sure the balance is maintained.""

The other me stepped closer. ""It's not a bad existence, Marcus. You'll get to help people. Strange people, people caught between worlds, but people nonetheless. You'll be part of a network that spans the highways, the truck stops, the spaces between normal places.""

""And if I walk away? Now?""

Dale answered: ""Then someone else will take your place. Someone who might not follow the rules as well. Someone who might let the balance tip.""

I looked at the letter in my hand. The woman had said I'd understand when I needed to. Now felt like the time. I opened it.

The handwriting was shaky but clear:

""Marcus, my dear grandson. If you're reading this, you've found your place in the web. Your grandmother chose to remember the highways as they were, before they became something else. Your grandfather chose his truck and his route. Now you must choose your role. There's no shame in walking away, but remember ‚Äì everyone connected to this place has a part to play. Choose wisely. With love, Grandma Chen.""

Chen. Like Tommy Chen. Like the address on the envelope.

""Tommy is my grandfather,"" I said, understanding flooding through me.

""Was,"" Dale corrected. ""Now he's something else. Something that maintains the connections between places like this. The questions is: what do you want to become?""

The other me held out the keys again. They caught the fluorescent light and seemed to pulse with their own inner glow.

""I need time to think.""

""You have until dawn,"" Dale said. ""But remember ‚Äì the choice will be made one way or another. The loop needs someone to walk it.""

4:00 AM. Two hours left.

I slipped the letter into my pocket next to the rules. The other me sat down behind the counter, and for a moment, we were both there, two versions of the same person separated by time and choices.

""It's peaceful, mostly,"" he said. ""The customers are rarely hostile. The rules make sense once you understand what they're protecting. And you get to be part of something larger than yourself.""

""But I'll never leave.""

""Define leaving. Your body will stay here, but your purpose will extend across every highway, every truck stop, every place where the strange travelers need shelter.""

Outside, the black truck waited patiently, its driver watching through dark windows.

The choice was mine.

But first, I had to survive the rest of the night.

The next hour passed in surreal calm. My other self sat behind the counter, humming that seven-note tune I'd caught myself singing the night before. He seemed content, almost meditative, like someone who'd finally found peace after a long struggle.

Dale removed his mask and hung it on a hook behind the register I'd never noticed before. Without it, he looked ordinary ‚Äì tired middle management, graying hair, coffee stains on his shirt. But his eyes held depths that spoke of years spent managing more than just a convenience store.

""You have questions,"" he said.

""Thousands.""

""Ask the important ones. Time's limited.""

""How long has this been going on?""

""Depends how you measure. The network of strange travelers has existed since the first roads connected distant places. But this specific location? Since 1982, when we opened. That's when the confluence became strong enough to require management.""

""Confluence?""

""Places where different realities touch. Highway intersections, truck stops, airports ‚Äì anywhere people from different worlds might meet. Most are minor, barely noticeable. This one's significant enough to need rules.""

A customer entered ‚Äì a young woman in scrubs, probably coming off a hospital shift. She moved normally, bought coffee and a breakfast burrito normally, paid with a normal credit card. When she left, I realized how much I'd missed ordinary interactions.

""Not everyone who comes here is.. strange?"" I asked.

""Most aren't,"" Dale said. ""Maybe one in twenty are traveling between places that don't quite exist. But their presence affects everything. Like drops of food coloring in water ‚Äì you need very little to change the whole glass.""

My other self spoke up: ""The rules exist to keep both types of customers safe. Normal people need protection from seeing too much. The others need protection from being seen too clearly.""

""What happens to people who break the rules?""

Dale's expression darkened. ""Depends on the rule. Minor ones, like serving the masked customer after 3:33, just create.. complications. Major ones can unravel someone's connection to their original reality. They become like Tommy, or Miguel, or any of the regulars. Stuck in loops, serving a function in the network.""

""And they're happy?""

""Happy might not be the right word. They're fulfilled. They have purpose. But they can't leave.""

Another customer entered ‚Äì an elderly man in overalls, buying motor oil and a pack of crackers. Normal transaction, normal interaction. But when he left, I noticed his pickup truck had no license plate at all, just a blank metal rectangle.

""How many people like you are there? Managing these places?""

""Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Every major truck stop has someone. Most airports. Some train stations. Anywhere travelers gather, especially at night."" Dale checked his watch. ""We're recruited based on our ability to follow instructions precisely and adapt to unusual circumstances.""

""Recruited?""

""You think I applied for this job through Indeed?"" He smiled grimly. ""I was working nights at a gas station outside Amarillo fifteen years ago. Different rules, same basic situation. When I proved capable, I was offered a promotion. Better pay, better benefits, but the work never stops.""

My other self stood and stretched. ""It's not as bad as it sounds, Marcus. You'll find rhythms. Patterns. The strange customers become familiar. You'll look forward to Tommy's stories, Miguel's silent nods, even the coffee machine's color changes.""

""But I'll never see my family again. My friends.""

""You'll see them,"" Dale said. ""Just differently. Time moves strangely in the network. A night here might be minutes in the outside world, or it might be days. You'll age slower. Your relationships will.. adjust.""

5:17 AM. Less than an hour left to decide.

""Can I visit other locations? See other parts of this network?""

""Eventually. After you've proven stable, you can travel between nodes. Meet other managers, other chosen workers. Some people enjoy the community aspect.""

A phone rang ‚Äì not the store phone, but a cell phone in Dale's pocket. He answered quickly.

""Yes? .. I see .. How many? .. Understood.""

He hung up and looked troubled.

""Problem?""

""There's been an incident in Oklahoma. A night manager broke protocol, tried to document everything with a camera. The local confluence is destabilizing. We might need to relocate some of the travelers.""

""Relocate?""

""People like Tommy, Miguel, the letter lady. Sometimes they need to move between locations to maintain balance. It's disruptive but necessary.""

The doors chimed, and a familiar figure entered ‚Äì the woman who'd given me the letter. But she looked different now, younger, wearing modern clothes instead of vintage ones.

""Mrs.Chen,"" Dale greeted her. ""Is it time?""

""Nearly,"" she said, approaching the counter. She smiled at me, and I could see the family resemblance clearly now. ""Hello, grandson.""

""You're really my grandmother?""

""Was. Am. Will be. Time isn't linear in the network."" She patted my hand. ""I chose to remember our family's connections to these places. Your grandfather chose to maintain them through his traveling. Now you have the opportunity to guard them.""

""The letter you had me write,"" she continued, addressing Dale, ""it went through?""

""This morning. The Vancouver location confirmed receipt. They're prepared.""

She turned back to me. ""Your cousin David works the night shift at a truck stop outside Seattle. Same situation, same choice. Family often finds its way to these positions. We're drawn to them.""

My other self checked the clock. ""Thirty-seven minutes left.""

""What happens if I choose to leave?"" I asked.

Dale sighed. ""Then we find someone else. But transitions are difficult. The customers sense changes in management. Some of them don't handle it well. And honestly, Marcus, you're already deeply involved. The rules have been working through you for two nights. That connection isn't easy to sever.""

""Meaning?""

""You might leave physically, but part of you would remain here. You'd find yourself driving past at odd hours, remembering customers you'd never met, humming songs you'd never heard. It would pull at you until you either came back or went mad.""

""That's not really a choice, then.""

""It's as much choice as anyone gets in life,"" my grandmother said gently. ""The question isn't whether you'll be part of something larger than yourself. Everyone is, in some way. The question is whether you'll choose your role consciously or let it happen to you.""

Another customer entered ‚Äì a trucker I'd never seen before, buying supplies for the road. But as he paid, I noticed his name tag: ""David Chen.""

My cousin. But this version looked older, wearier, like he'd been traveling much longer than any normal person should.

""Marcus?"" He looked surprised to see me. ""I didn't know you were working here.""

""Just started the night shift.""

""Ah."" Understanding flickered in his eyes. ""Your time to choose, then. It's not a bad life, cousin. Lonely sometimes, but meaningful. You'll help people who have nowhere else to go.""

He bought a coffee and a map of highways that didn't match any road atlas I'd ever seen. The routes were labeled with names like ""The Dreaming Path"" and ""Connection Avenue.""

""Maybe I'll see you around the network,"" he said, then left.

""How many family members are involved in this?""

""More than you might think,"" Grandmother Chen said. ""Your aunt runs a diner in New Mexico that serves similar functions. Your uncle manages a motel in Montana. We've been maintaining these connections for generations.""

5:45 AM. Fifteen minutes.

My other self took the keys from his pocket again. ""Last chance, Marcus. I've been doing this for.. I've lost track of how long. But I've helped thousands of travelers find what they needed. Some were lost souls looking for peace. Others were beings from different realities seeking safe passage. All needed someone to follow the rules, maintain the balance.""

""And if I take your place, you're free?""

""Free to move on. To whatever comes next for people like us.""

Dale nodded. ""The network doesn't trap people forever. When your replacement is ready, you'll have options. Some choose to move to higher positions ‚Äì managing multiple locations, coordinating between regions. Others choose to step outside reality entirely.""

""What does that mean?""

""Hard to explain. But some former managers become something like guardian spirits for the entire network. They exist in the spaces between spaces, helping when things go wrong.""

The clock showed 5:50 AM.

Ten minutes.

I looked at the keys in my other self's hand. They seemed heavier now, weighted with responsibility and possibility.

""Marcus,"" Dale said quietly, ""understand this isn't just about you. The network needs people it can trust. People who'll follow rules not out of fear, but out of understanding. You've proven you can do that.""

""And if I screw up?""

""Then we'll help you fix it. That's what the network is for.""

5:55 AM.

Five minutes.

My grandmother squeezed my hand. ""Whatever you choose, I'm proud of you. You've honored our family's legacy just by being here.""

The automatic doors were silent. No more customers would come before dawn.

Four minutes.

I picked up the keys.

The keys felt warm in my palm, like they'd been held by someone for a very long time. Three minutes left.

""I need to know something,"" I said to my other self. ""When did you start? What year?""

He smiled sadly. ""2021. Three years ago, your time.""

""That's impossible. I started working here three years ago.""

""Time isn't linear in the network, Marcus. I'm you from another possibility. A version where you said yes the first night you were offered the choice. Where you took the keys immediately.""

Dale nodded. ""Sometimes the network shows people their alternative paths. Usually, it helps with the decision.""

""So he's not my replacement. He's what I become if I say yes?""

""One version of it,"" my other self confirmed. ""I've seen different paths too. A Marcus who became a regional coordinator, moving between dozen of locations. Another who chose the guardian path and became something that exists between realities. And one who walked away.""

""What happened to the one who walked away?""

The room grew cold. Outside, I could hear wind that hadn't been there before.

1kooyfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/rulestofollow/comments/1kooyfa/im_a_night_shift_worker_at_bucees_gas_station_in/,"I'm a Night Shift Worker at Buc-ee's GAS STATION IN RURAL TEXAS, There are STRANGE RULES to follow ! (Part 1 )","I never thought I'd still be working the graveyard shift at Buc-ee's on Highway 35, thirty miles south of Austin. My name's Marcus, and I've been manning this particular outpost for three years now. The massive travel center sits like a neon beacon in the darkness, drawing every kind of traveler you can imagine across the Texas landscape.

During daylight hours, families pile out of minivans loaded with coolers and kids, grabbing the famous brisket sandwiches and those overpriced beaver nuggets. But nights? That's when you meet the real Texas. Long-haul truckers pulling double trailers filled with everything from cattle to computer parts. Ranch hands driving dusty F-250s with livestock trailers, heading to auction in San Antonio. Weekend warriors in lifted Chevy Silverados, their beds stuffed with camping gear and beer coolers.

There's old Miguel, who stops every Tuesday around 2 AM in his weathered Ford pickup, buying the same exact items: two energy drinks, a bag of beef jerky, and a pack of Marlboro Reds. He tips his hat but never speaks, just nods and disappears back onto the highway. Then there's Sarah, a trucker from Minnesota who hauls frozen foods down to Mexico. She's got a mouth like a sailor and tells the best road stories I've ever heard while she waits for her logbook hours to reset.

The strangest regular is probably Tommy Chen, who drives an immaculate 1979 Peterbilt with hand-painted flames down the sides. He claims he's been driving these highways since before I was born, which would make him impossibly old based on how young he looks. Tommy only stops during the deepest part of night, always buys exactly thirteen items, and pays in cash that looks like it's fresh from the mint.

But last Thursday, something different rolled into our lot. I was restocking the coffee station around 3:30 AM when headlights swept across the windows in an odd pattern ‚Äì not the usual steady approach of a truck or car. This vehicle seemed to pause, then advance, pause again, like it was.. considering.

A massive black pickup truck finally parked under the far edge of our lighting. Not black like most trucks you see on the road, but black like the space between stars. The kind of black that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. No license plate visible from where I stood. No mud, no road dust, no scratches ‚Äì unusual for any vehicle that's spent time on Texas highways.

The driver sat motionless for nearly ten minutes. Through the tinted windshield, I could make out only the outline of someone wearing what looked like a wide-brimmed hat pulled low. No movement, no engine noise after parking. Just stillness.

Finally, the door opened with a soft click that somehow carried all the way to the store. The driver emerged slowly, wearing a long coat despite the October heat. What caught my attention wasn't the coat or the hat, though. It was the mask.

A simple white medical mask, the kind everyone wore during covid, but something about it felt wrong. Maybe it was how perfectly clean it looked, or how it seemed to catch the fluorescent light in a way that made it almost glow. The driver ‚Äì I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman ‚Äì walked with measured steps toward the entrance, never looking left or right, never acknowledging the security cameras.

I pretended to be busy with inventory as they entered. The automatic doors chimed their usual welcome, but the sound felt flat, muffled somehow. The person moved through the aisles without making any noise ‚Äì no footsteps on the polished floor, no rustle of clothing. They selected items methodically: a bottle of water, a package of crackers, and a single banana. Nothing else.

At the counter, they placed exact change on the surface without speaking. As I rang up the items, I tried to make eye contact, but the mask and hat cast shadows that seemed deeper than they should.

""Have a good night,"" I said, handing over the receipt.

They tilted their head slightly, like an animal listening to a distant sound, then walked out the same deliberate way they'd entered. The truck started without any engine noise I could hear and pulled away, taillights disappearing into the darkness of Highway 35.

That was five days ago. Since then, my manager Dale handed me a folded piece of paper during shift change. ""Follow these exactly,"" he said, his usual joking demeanor completely absent. ""Some rules for night shift. Don't ask questions.""

I unfolded the paper in the break room. Seven simple rules written in block letters. Rules I'd never heard of despite working here for three years.

Tonight's my first shift following them. It's 11 PM now, and the black truck just pulled into the lot again.

I pulled the folded paper from my pocket, hands trembling slightly. The rules were written in bold, black ink:

RULE 1: Never serve the customer in the white mask after 3:33 AM.
RULE 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.
RULE 3: The coffee machine in aisle 3 may drip red liquid between 2-4 AM. Clean immediately.
RULE 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.
RULE 5: If you hear whistling from the truck lot, stay inside until it stops.
RULE 6: Lock the cooler doors at exactly midnight. Do not open them until 6 AM.
RULE 7: If the same customer enters more than once in a single shift, only serve them the first time.

The black truck sat motionless under the flickering security light. Through the window, I could see the driver hadn't moved. Same white mask, same wide-brimmed hat. It was 11:47 PM according to the register clock.

I stuffed the rules back into my pocket and tried to focus on normal tasks. The store felt different tonight ‚Äì sounds seemed muffled, like someone had wrapped the building in cotton. Even the usual highway traffic noise faded to a distant whisper.

At exactly midnight, I remembered Rule 6. I walked to the cooler section and turned each lock mechanism. The metallic clicks echoed louder than they should have. As I locked the beer cooler, something rattled inside. Something that definitely wasn't bottles.

Back at the counter, I noticed the security monitors. Twelve screens showing different angles of the store and parking lot. Most displayed normally ‚Äì the bright interior, the scattered cars outside. But Monitor 7, which showed the main entrance, flickered every few seconds. During these flickers, the entrance area appeared different somehow. Older. The floor looked like aged concrete instead of polished tile.

A customer entered at 12:23 AM. Betty Rodriguez, a nurse from the VA hospital in San Antonio. She worked double shifts and always bought the same thing ‚Äì a large coffee and two energy bars. Normal as could be.

""Hey Marcus,"" she said, yawning. ""Quiet night?""

""Pretty much."" I rang up her items. ""Drive safe out there.""

She headed for the door, then paused. ""That truck out there.. is that guy okay? He's been sitting there for like an hour.""

I glanced at the monitors. The black truck remained in the same position. ""Yeah, he's.. taking a break.""

Betty shrugged and left. Through the window, I watched her walk to her Honda Pilot, right past the black truck. She didn't even glance at it, like it wasn't there.

At 1:15 AM, Tommy Chen pulled up in his flame-painted Peterbilt. But when he walked in, something felt off. He moved to the snack aisle and began selecting items: peanuts, a candy bar, chips, crackers, gum, a drink, another drink, cookies, jerky, mints, breath spray, energy bar, and finally a pack of gum ‚Äì thirteen items exactly.

My stomach dropped. Rule 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.

""How's the road tonight, Tommy?"" I asked, scanning his items.

""Roads are different after midnight,"" he said, watching me closely. ""You learning that now?""

The total came to $37.84. I entered a 50% discount, bringing it to $18.92. Tommy nodded approvingly and paid in those strangely crisp bills.

""Good boy,"" he whispered, then left without another word.

The next hour passed uneventfully until I noticed something dripping in aisle 3. The coffee machine ‚Äì the old one they kept running for nostalgic customers ‚Äì was leaking. But the liquid wasn't brown.

It was dark red.

Rule 3 flashed through my mind. I grabbed cleaning supplies and hurried over. The substance looked like coffee but smelled metallic, like pennies mixed with burnt rubber. As I wiped it up, more droplets fell, each landing with a soft plop that echoed strangely.

The cleaning rag soaked up the liquid, turning burgundy. I used three rags before the dripping stopped. Instead of throwing them away, something made me put them in a plastic bag and hide them under the counter. I don't know why.

At 2:17 AM, the automatic doors chimed, and a man in a business suit walked in. Expensive clothes, perfectly groomed, but something nagged at me. I glanced at the security monitors.

Monitor 4 showed him clearly browsing the magazines. Monitor 7 showed the same aisle.

Empty.

No reflection of the man in Monitor 7. Just the magazine rack and empty floor.

Rule 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.

The man approached my counter with a newspaper and a pack of gum. He stood there, waiting. I stared at my hands, focusing on reorganizing the receipt tape, anything to avoid eye contact.

""Excuse me,"" he said. His voice sounded exactly like my father's.

I kept sorting receipts.

""Son, I'd like to buy these items.""

Still Dad's voice. Perfectly reproduced. I gripped the counter edge, knuckles white.

The man waited for two full minutes, then set the items down and walked out. When I looked up, he was gone. The monitors showed him disappearing through the doors, but Monitor 7 had never shown him at all.

3:28 AM. Five minutes before the rule about the masked customer would matter. The black truck hadn't moved. Its driver remained motionless behind the wheel.

I checked the time obsessively. 3:30. 3:31. 3:32.

At exactly 3:33 AM, the truck door opened.

The driver stepped out, straightened their coat, and walked toward the store. Each step seemed perfectly timed, landing on an invisible beat. The automatic doors opened, letting in a rush of cold air that shouldn't exist in October Texas heat.

The figure approached my counter. Up close, the mask looked even stranger ‚Äì too smooth, too white, too perfectly fitted. No breath stirred the material.

They placed three items on the counter: water, crackers, and a banana. Same as before.

According to Rule 1, I couldn't serve them. But they stood there, waiting, while that white mask seemed to bore into my soul.

Time stretched. Seconds felt like minutes. The store's fluorescent lights hummed different tunes, creating harmonies I'd never noticed.

Finally, I spoke: ""I.. I can't help you right now.""

The figure tilted their head, like they'd expected this response. They left the items on the counter and walked away, each step as measured as before.

Through the window, I watched them return to the truck. But instead of driving away, they placed something on my windshield ‚Äì a folded paper tucked under my wiper blade.

The truck then pulled away, disappearing into the Texas night.

At 4 AM, I went outside to retrieve the paper. It was another list of rules, written in the same block letters. But these rules were different.

And they had my name on them.

I unfolded the paper with shaking hands. The handwriting was different this time ‚Äì not block letters, but flowing cursive that looked oddly familiar.

Marcus,
You've done well following the first rules. Now come the real ones. These apply only to you.
PERSONAL RULE 1: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.
PERSONAL RULE 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.
PERSONAL RULE 3: Your shift ends at 6 AM. Do not leave before then, no matter what happens.
PERSONAL RULE 4: The phone behind the counter will ring three times between 4-5 AM. Answer on the fourth ring.
PERSONAL RULE 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

I stared at the paper until the words blurred. How did this person know my mother's voice? How did they know these specific details about my life?

Back inside, I tucked the new rules into my wallet. The store felt heavier now, like the air had thickened into syrup. Every shadow seemed deeper, every reflection distorted.

At 4:07 AM, Miguel arrived in his Ford pickup. But something was wrong. Instead of his usual two energy drinks, jerky, and cigarettes, he bought a single lottery ticket. He paid with a twenty-dollar bill that smelled like flowers.

""You should go home,"" he said quietly, avoiding eye contact. ""This isn't your fight.""

Before I could respond, he walked out, leaving his change on the counter. Through the window, I watched him drive away faster than his truck should have been capable of.

4:23 AM. The phone rang.

Once. Twice. Three times.

I reached for it but stopped. Personal Rule 4: Answer on the fourth ring.

Fourth ring. I picked up.

Static filled the line, punctuated by what sounded like breathing. Then a woman's voice, crackling through interference: ""Baby? Marcus, baby, is that you?""

My mother. Exactly like she sounded before the cancer took her voice. Before the chemotherapy made her whisper. Before she died two years ago.

""I'm so cold, Marcus. I'm trapped in here. Please let me out.""

Personal Rule 1 blazed in my mind: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.

""I know you can hear me,"" the voice continued. ""Remember when you were seven, and you got lost at Zilker Park? I found you by the playground. I promised I'd always find you.""

The voice was perfect. Every inflection, every pause where she'd catch her breath. I started walking toward the back of the store before catching myself.

""Marcus? Please. I'm so cold. Just open the door.""

I hung up.

The silence afterwards felt like judgment. Had I just abandoned my mother's ghost? Or avoided something wearing her voice like a cheap costume?

At 4:45 AM, I noticed something on Monitor 3. A figure walking through the store. Male, average height, wearing the same Buc-ee's uniform I had on.

Me.

I watched myself on the screen, moving through aisles I wasn't in, stocking shelves I hadn't touched. The monitor-me looked tired, older somehow. He moved systematically, efficiently, like someone who'd worked here much longer than three years.

Personal Rule 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.

I forced my gaze to the counter, but peripheral vision caught the monitor-me stopping at the camera, looking directly at it. Direct at me. The face was mine but wrong ‚Äì too pale, eyes too wide, mouth turned down in permanent disappointment.

I kept my head down for ten minutes, reorganizing everything within reach. When I finally glanced back, the monitor showed only empty aisles.

5:15 AM brought Sarah, the trucker from Minnesota. But she looked different. Her usually bright demeanor was gone, replaced by something hollow.

""Marcus, honey,"" she said, her voice strangely formal. ""I've been talking with management. They want me to cover the rest of your shift. You can go home.""

Personal Rule 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

""Thanks, but I'm good. Just an hour left.""

Sarah's smile twitched. ""Come on, you look exhausted. I'll handle everything. Clock out now.""

""Really, I appreciate it, but I need to finish my shift.""

Her expression darkened. ""Marcus, this isn't a request. Management wants you gone. Now.""

""Call Dale if you want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I'm staying until six.""

Something flickered across Sarah's face ‚Äì anger, frustration, then resignation. ""Fine,"" she said. ""But don't say I didn't warn you.""

She left without buying anything, which had never happened before. Through the window, I watched her truck pull away, but the license plates were different. Instead of Minnesota plates, they were blank white rectangles.

5:30 AM. Thirty minutes left.

The store began to change. Subtle at first ‚Äì products on shelves rearranging themselves when I wasn't looking. The Buc-ee's merchandise display shifted from t-shirts to items I didn't recognize: snow globes containing miniature gas stations, keychains shaped like tiny white masks, coffee mugs with my face printed on them.

The security monitors showed increasingly wrong images. Monitor 5 displayed the store from an angle that shouldn't exist, looking down from the ceiling. Monitor 8 showed the parking lot but with different cars ‚Äì vehicles that looked decades old, rusted, some with their doors hanging open.

5:45 AM. I found myself humming a song I'd never heard before, something with seven distinct notes that repeated endlessly. When I realized what I was doing, I bit my tongue hard enough to taste copper.

The automatic doors chimed, and a woman entered. She moved with precise steps, her high heels clicking against the tile in a rhythm that matched my humming. As she approached, I saw her face.

My mother. But not as I remembered her. This version was younger, maybe thirty years old, wearing a white dress that seemed to move independently of any breeze. Her hair was perfect, her skin unmarked by illness.

""Marcus,"" she said, and her voice was exactly as I'd heard on the phone. ""Let's go home together.""

She extended her hand. Her fingernails were painted white, and her wedding ring caught the fluorescent light like a tiny star.

""I'm not ready,"" I whispered.

""You don't have to be. Just take my hand.""

I wanted to. God, I wanted to. The pain of losing her had never faded, just learned to hide better. Here she was, whole and healthy, offering to take away three years of grief.

But something about her eyes was wrong. They held too much knowledge, too much sadness for someone her apparent age. And when she blinked, darkness lingered beneath her eyelids longer than it should.

""I can't,"" I said.

Her expression didn't change, but disappointment radiated from her like heat from asphalt. ""I understand,"" she said softly. ""But I had to try.""

She turned and walked away, her heels echoing with each step. At the door, she looked back.

""I'm proud of you, baby. You're stronger than I was.""

The doors closed behind her. I checked the monitors ‚Äì they showed no trace of her having been here at all.

5:58 AM. Two minutes left.

The store returned to normal with jarring suddenness. Products snapped back to their proper places. Security monitors showed standard views. The oppressive atmosphere lifted like fog burning off in morning sun.

6:00 AM exactly.

Dale walked through the doors in his standard manager uniform, coffee in hand, looking utterly ordinary.

""Morning, Marcus. Quiet night?""

I stared at him, still processing everything that had happened. ""Relatively.""

""Good, good. Go ahead and clock out. Jenny's here for the morning shift.""

I gathered my things slowly, checking the monitors one last time. Everything normal. No sign of the strangeness from the past seven hours.

As I walked to my car, I noticed something on my windshield. Not a note this time, but a single black feather held in place by my wiper blade.

I drove home in silence, but couldn't shake the feeling that tonight had been a test.

And somehow, I'd passed.

I barely slept that day. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the security monitor version of myself staring back, or heard my mother's voice pleading from somewhere cold and dark. By 10 PM, I was back at the store, keys jingling in my shaking hands.

Dale was still there, finishing paperwork. He looked up when I entered, and something passed over his face ‚Äì relief, maybe, or resignation.

""Marcus. Good, you came back.""

""Did you think I wouldn't?""

""After the first night with the rules, some people don't. They find other jobs, leave town, pretend none of it happened."" He stood, gathering his things. ""You did well yesterday. Following them exactly.""

""Where do the rules come from?""

Dale paused at the door. ""That's not for me to say. But I will tell you this ‚Äì everyone who's worked nights here eventually gets their own set. Some people fight them. Those people.."" He shook his head. ""Just follow the rules, Marcus. They're not meant to hurt you.""

He left me alone with questions multiplying like bacteria.

The first few hours passed quietly. Normal customers, normal transactions. Old Miguel came by as always, buying his usual items, but this time he looked me directly in the eye.

""You're still here,"" he said.

""Where else would I be?""

""Some places are doors,"" he said cryptically. ""You chose not to walk through. That means something.""

At 1:30 AM, Tommy Chen arrived, but his truck looked different. The flame paint job was faded, like it had aged decades overnight. He bought exactly thirteen items again, but these were completely different from his usual selections: birthday candles, matches, a bottle of red wine, children's birthday cake mix, vanilla extract, food coloring, plastic forks, paper plates, napkins, a disposable camera, balloons, ribbon, and a congratulations card.

""Whose birthday?"" I asked, applying the half-price discount.

""Mine,"" he said. ""Every night is my birthday now.""

He paid with those crisp bills, but this time I noticed the dates. They were all from 1979. Perfect condition, like they'd been printed yesterday.

""How long have you been doing this run, Tommy?""

He smiled, and I saw his teeth were wrong ‚Äì too white, too uniform, like dentures made for someone else's mouth. ""Since my truck was new. Since this stretch of highway opened. Since they built this store."" He gathered his bags. ""Some of us chose to stay in the loop. Others get chosen for it.""

After he left, I found myself checking the local traffic reports on the computer. Highway 35 through this section had been completed in 1967. Buc-ee's had opened this location in 1982. Tommy's truck was a 1979 model.

The math didn't work.

2:47 AM brought an unusual customer ‚Äì a woman in her sixties wearing a Lubbock High School class ring and carrying a purse that looked like it belonged in a museum. She moved slowly, methodically, selecting items with the kind of precision that suggested ritual.

She bought seven items: a bottle of water, a bag of peanuts, a candy bar, a local newspaper, a pen, an envelope, and stamps. At the counter, she opened the newspaper, read something that made her frown, then wrote a short letter. She sealed it in the envelope, addressed it in careful cursive, and applied a stamp.

""Could you mail this for me, honey?"" she asked, handing me the letter.

The address read: Marcus Chen, Buc-ee's Travel Plaza, Highway 35, Austin, Texas

My address. My name. But the last name was wrong.

""Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake. This has my first name, but‚Äî""

""No mistake,"" she said firmly. ""You'll understand when you need to.""

She left cash on the counter and walked out. Through the window, I watched her get into a car that looked like it was from the 1950s, mint condition but somehow dusty. The license plate read ""MEMORY.""

I held the letter up to the light. Inside, I could make out handwriting, but couldn't read the words. Something told me not to open it yet.

At 3:15 AM, the coffee machine in aisle 3 started dripping again. Red liquid, same as before. But this time, I noticed something else. The droplets weren't random ‚Äì they were forming a pattern on the floor. Letters.

MARCUS

I cleaned it quickly, but the letters reappeared immediately. Different this time.

YOUR TURN

I cleaned again. The droplets stopped, but a new message had formed:

C H O O S E

The automatic doors chimed. I looked up to see someone in a Buc-ee's uniform walking in. Male, my height, my build. As he got closer, I realized with growing horror that it was me. Exactly me, down to the small scar on my left hand from a childhood accident.

But this version looked tired in a way that went beyond losing sleep. His eyes held a weariness that seemed to span years. He moved like someone who'd been walking the same path for far too long.

""Finally,"" he said, his voice exactly mine but somehow older. ""I was wondering when you'd show up.""

The security monitors didn't show him at all.

""Personal Rule 2,"" I whispered. ""Don't look at myself in the monitors.""

""Smart,"" the other me said. ""But this isn't a monitor, is it? This is face to face.""

""What do you want?""

""To go home. To sleep. To stop walking this loop."" He gestured around the store. ""Do you know how long I've been here? How many nights I've served the same customers, followed the same rules, pretended everything was normal?""

""I don't understand.""

""You will. See, here's the thing about loops, Marcus. Someone has to walk them. Someone has to keep the store running, serve the customers who aren't quite customers, follow rules that aren't quite rules."" He smiled, and it was my smile but wrong. ""I've done my time. Now it's your turn.""

""That's not how it works.""

""Isn't it? Look at Tommy Chen. Look at Miguel. Look at everyone who comes here regularly. We're all in loops, Marcus. The question is whether you choose yours willingly or get trapped in it accidentally.""

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. My keys, but these were tarnished, worn smooth by endless use.

""Take them. Take my place. I'll walk out that door, and you'll never see me again. You'll work the night shift forever, but you'll be part of something bigger. Something that keeps the balance.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Then we'll keep running into each other. Night after night. Until one of us breaks or until you finally understand that this is inevitable.""

I stared at the keys. They seemed heavier than they should, like they were made of something denser than metal.

""Why me?""

""Because you followed the rules. Because when the loop tested you ‚Äì with your mother, with your own reflection, with every temptation to leave early ‚Äì you stayed. That kind of dedication is rare. The others who work here, they're just doing a job. You're doing something more.""

The clock above the register read 3:33 AM.

The doors chimed again. The black truck driver entered, still wearing that white mask. But now I could see through it, see the face underneath.

It was Dale. My manager Dale, but decades younger.

""Time to choose, Marcus,"" Dale's voice came from behind the mask. ""Tommy chose his truck and his eternal run. Miguel chose his Tuesday routine. The lady with the letter chose to remember things that were lost.""

""What about you?""

""I chose to manage this place. To guide each new night shift worker through their first encounters with the rules. To make sure the balance is maintained.""

The other me stepped closer. ""It's not a bad existence, Marcus. You'll get to help people. Strange people, people caught between worlds, but people nonetheless. You'll be part of a network that spans the highways, the truck stops, the spaces between normal places.""

""And if I walk away? Now?""

Dale answered: ""Then someone else will take your place. Someone who might not follow the rules as well. Someone who might let the balance tip.""

I looked at the letter in my hand. The woman had said I'd understand when I needed to. Now felt like the time. I opened it.

The handwriting was shaky but clear:

""Marcus, my dear grandson. If you're reading this, you've found your place in the web. Your grandmother chose to remember the highways as they were, before they became something else. Your grandfather chose his truck and his route. Now you must choose your role. There's no shame in walking away, but remember ‚Äì everyone connected to this place has a part to play. Choose wisely. With love, Grandma Chen.""

Chen. Like Tommy Chen. Like the address on the envelope.

""Tommy is my grandfather,"" I said, understanding flooding through me.

""Was,"" Dale corrected. ""Now he's something else. Something that maintains the connections between places like this. The questions is: what do you want to become?""

The other me held out the keys again. They caught the fluorescent light and seemed to pulse with their own inner glow.

""I need time to think.""

""You have until dawn,"" Dale said. ""But remember ‚Äì the choice will be made one way or another. The loop needs someone to walk it.""

4:00 AM. Two hours left.

I slipped the letter into my pocket next to the rules. The other me sat down behind the counter, and for a moment, we were both there, two versions of the same person separated by time and choices.

""It's peaceful, mostly,"" he said. ""The customers are rarely hostile. The rules make sense once you understand what they're protecting. And you get to be part of something larger than yourself.""

""But I'll never leave.""

""Define leaving. Your body will stay here, but your purpose will extend across every highway, every truck stop, every place where the strange travelers need shelter.""

Outside, the black truck waited patiently, its driver watching through dark windows.

The choice was mine.

But first, I had to survive the rest of the night.

The next hour passed in surreal calm. My other self sat behind the counter, humming that seven-note tune I'd caught myself singing the night before. He seemed content, almost meditative, like someone who'd finally found peace after a long struggle.

Dale removed his mask and hung it on a hook behind the register I'd never noticed before. Without it, he looked ordinary ‚Äì tired middle management, graying hair, coffee stains on his shirt. But his eyes held depths that spoke of years spent managing more than just a convenience store.

""You have questions,"" he said.

""Thousands.""

""Ask the important ones. Time's limited.""

""How long has this been going on?""

""Depends how you measure. The network of strange travelers has existed since the first roads connected distant places. But this specific location? Since 1982, when we opened. That's when the confluence became strong enough to require management.""

""Confluence?""

""Places where different realities touch. Highway intersections, truck stops, airports ‚Äì anywhere people from different worlds might meet. Most are minor, barely noticeable. This one's significant enough to need rules.""

A customer entered ‚Äì a young woman in scrubs, probably coming off a hospital shift. She moved normally, bought coffee and a breakfast burrito normally, paid with a normal credit card. When she left, I realized how much I'd missed ordinary interactions.

""Not everyone who comes here is.. strange?"" I asked.

""Most aren't,"" Dale said. ""Maybe one in twenty are traveling between places that don't quite exist. But their presence affects everything. Like drops of food coloring in water ‚Äì you need very little to change the whole glass.""

My other self spoke up: ""The rules exist to keep both types of customers safe. Normal people need protection from seeing too much. The others need protection from being seen too clearly.""

""What happens to people who break the rules?""

Dale's expression darkened. ""Depends on the rule. Minor ones, like serving the masked customer after 3:33, just create.. complications. Major ones can unravel someone's connection to their original reality. They become like Tommy, or Miguel, or any of the regulars. Stuck in loops, serving a function in the network.""

""And they're happy?""

""Happy might not be the right word. They're fulfilled. They have purpose. But they can't leave.""

Another customer entered ‚Äì an elderly man in overalls, buying motor oil and a pack of crackers. Normal transaction, normal interaction. But when he left, I noticed his pickup truck had no license plate at all, just a blank metal rectangle.

""How many people like you are there? Managing these places?""

""Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Every major truck stop has someone. Most airports. Some train stations. Anywhere travelers gather, especially at night."" Dale checked his watch. ""We're recruited based on our ability to follow instructions precisely and adapt to unusual circumstances.""

""Recruited?""

""You think I applied for this job through Indeed?"" He smiled grimly. ""I was working nights at a gas station outside Amarillo fifteen years ago. Different rules, same basic situation. When I proved capable, I was offered a promotion. Better pay, better benefits, but the work never stops.""

My other self stood and stretched. ""It's not as bad as it sounds, Marcus. You'll find rhythms. Patterns. The strange customers become familiar. You'll look forward to Tommy's stories, Miguel's silent nods, even the coffee machine's color changes.""

""But I'll never see my family again. My friends.""

""You'll see them,"" Dale said. ""Just differently. Time moves strangely in the network. A night here might be minutes in the outside world, or it might be days. You'll age slower. Your relationships will.. adjust.""

5:17 AM. Less than an hour left to decide.

""Can I visit other locations? See other parts of this network?""

""Eventually. After you've proven stable, you can travel between nodes. Meet other managers, other chosen workers. Some people enjoy the community aspect.""

A phone rang ‚Äì not the store phone, but a cell phone in Dale's pocket. He answered quickly.

""Yes? .. I see .. How many? .. Understood.""

He hung up and looked troubled.

""Problem?""

""There's been an incident in Oklahoma. A night manager broke protocol, tried to document everything with a camera. The local confluence is destabilizing. We might need to relocate some of the travelers.""

""Relocate?""

""People like Tommy, Miguel, the letter lady. Sometimes they need to move between locations to maintain balance. It's disruptive but necessary.""

The doors chimed, and a familiar figure entered ‚Äì the woman who'd given me the letter. But she looked different now, younger, wearing modern clothes instead of vintage ones.

""Mrs.Chen,"" Dale greeted her. ""Is it time?""

""Nearly,"" she said, approaching the counter. She smiled at me, and I could see the family resemblance clearly now. ""Hello, grandson.""

""You're really my grandmother?""

""Was. Am. Will be. Time isn't linear in the network."" She patted my hand. ""I chose to remember our family's connections to these places. Your grandfather chose to maintain them through his traveling. Now you have the opportunity to guard them.""

""The letter you had me write,"" she continued, addressing Dale, ""it went through?""

""This morning. The Vancouver location confirmed receipt. They're prepared.""

She turned back to me. ""Your cousin David works the night shift at a truck stop outside Seattle. Same situation, same choice. Family often finds its way to these positions. We're drawn to them.""

My other self checked the clock. ""Thirty-seven minutes left.""

""What happens if I choose to leave?"" I asked.

Dale sighed. ""Then we find someone else. But transitions are difficult. The customers sense changes in management. Some of them don't handle it well. And honestly, Marcus, you're already deeply involved. The rules have been working through you for two nights. That connection isn't easy to sever.""

""Meaning?""

""You might leave physically, but part of you would remain here. You'd find yourself driving past at odd hours, remembering customers you'd never met, humming songs you'd never heard. It would pull at you until you either came back or went mad.""

""That's not really a choice, then.""

""It's as much choice as anyone gets in life,"" my grandmother said gently. ""The question isn't whether you'll be part of something larger than yourself. Everyone is, in some way. The question is whether you'll choose your role consciously or let it happen to you.""

Another customer entered ‚Äì a trucker I'd never seen before, buying supplies for the road. But as he paid, I noticed his name tag: ""David Chen.""

My cousin. But this version looked older, wearier, like he'd been traveling much longer than any normal person should.

""Marcus?"" He looked surprised to see me. ""I didn't know you were working here.""

""Just started the night shift.""

""Ah."" Understanding flickered in his eyes. ""Your time to choose, then. It's not a bad life, cousin. Lonely sometimes, but meaningful. You'll help people who have nowhere else to go.""

He bought a coffee and a map of highways that didn't match any road atlas I'd ever seen. The routes were labeled with names like ""The Dreaming Path"" and ""Connection Avenue.""

""Maybe I'll see you around the network,"" he said, then left.

""How many family members are involved in this?""

""More than you might think,"" Grandmother Chen said. ""Your aunt runs a diner in New Mexico that serves similar functions. Your uncle manages a motel in Montana. We've been maintaining these connections for generations.""

5:45 AM. Fifteen minutes.

My other self took the keys from his pocket again. ""Last chance, Marcus. I've been doing this for.. I've lost track of how long. But I've helped thousands of travelers find what they needed. Some were lost souls looking for peace. Others were beings from different realities seeking safe passage. All needed someone to follow the rules, maintain the balance.""

""And if I take your place, you're free?""

""Free to move on. To whatever comes next for people like us.""

Dale nodded. ""The network doesn't trap people forever. When your replacement is ready, you'll have options. Some choose to move to higher positions ‚Äì managing multiple locations, coordinating between regions. Others choose to step outside reality entirely.""

""What does that mean?""

""Hard to explain. But some former managers become something like guardian spirits for the entire network. They exist in the spaces between spaces, helping when things go wrong.""

The clock showed 5:50 AM.

Ten minutes.

I looked at the keys in my other self's hand. They seemed heavier now, weighted with responsibility and possibility.

""Marcus,"" Dale said quietly, ""understand this isn't just about you. The network needs people it can trust. People who'll follow rules not out of fear, but out of understanding. You've proven you can do that.""

""And if I screw up?""

""Then we'll help you fix it. That's what the network is for.""

5:55 AM.

Five minutes.

My grandmother squeezed my hand. ""Whatever you choose, I'm proud of you. You've honored our family's legacy just by being here.""

The automatic doors were silent. No more customers would come before dawn.

Four minutes.

I picked up the keys.

The keys felt warm in my palm, like they'd been held by someone for a very long time. Three minutes left.

""I need to know something,"" I said to my other self. ""When did you start? What year?""

He smiled sadly. ""2021. Three years ago, your time.""

""That's impossible. I started working here three years ago.""

""Time isn't linear in the network, Marcus. I'm you from another possibility. A version where you said yes the first night you were offered the choice. Where you took the keys immediately.""

Dale nodded. ""Sometimes the network shows people their alternative paths. Usually, it helps with the decision.""

""So he's not my replacement. He's what I become if I say yes?""

""One version of it,"" my other self confirmed. ""I've seen different paths too. A Marcus who became a regional coordinator, moving between dozen of locations. Another who chose the guardian path and became something that exists between realities. And one who walked away.""

""What happened to the one who walked away?""

The room grew cold. Outside, I could hear wind that hadn't been there before.

Had my first dose (2.5mg) on Thursday evening after a huge, almost celebratory (lol), dinner. 

Within a few hours, was physically unable to snack, which was great! 

Woke up Friday feeling full but also feeling like there's a hole in my stomach. Had a coffee as per normal. Feeling stayed the same. Had a Pot Noodle for Lunch which helped for a short time, though I couldn't finish it! 

The feeling of a hole in my stomach returned so had a Nurishment drink for protein at tea time. This also helped. Felt much better. 

Sipping water throughout the day. 

Dinner time - could barely eat. 

Felt hungry at 9pm so snacked (chocolates) without any issues. 

Woke up 2 am feeling sick, throwing up etc. Went back to bed. Woke up Saturday morning with a headache and feeling extremely fatigued.

I've ordered protein bars, shakes and electrolytes which are all coming later today but just wanted to check if these are normal symptoms and if they do eventually pass? Lol",1,1747473918.0,mounjarouk,3,0.99,False
1koox8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1koox8o/resetting_your_neuronal_system/,Resetting your neuronal system,"Hello everyone,I‚Äôm not sure if this will be useful to anyone, but it doesn‚Äôt cost me anything to share, so here it is.

All the information you‚Äôll find here took me countless hours to research. These days, you could probably gather it all in under an hour using AI, but back when I started, AI wasn‚Äôt even a thing \^\^

Most of the ‚Äútips‚Äù I‚Äôm sharing are backed by science, don‚Äôt involve medication, and have been genuinely helpful. That said, not everything will work for everyone, we‚Äôre all different, both mentally and physically. Some things worked for me, and they might not work for you.

As a general rule, my goal with this document is to help you¬†not only feel better¬†but also¬†think better¬†about yourself. It‚Äôs tough to change everything in a single day, so I recommend starting small, pick one or two tips and incorporate them into your daily life. Don‚Äôt try to do it all at once. You‚Äôll likely burn out and feel like a failure. It took me¬†years¬†to apply everything I‚Äôve learned, and even now, I often forget things or I‚Äôm simply too tired (or lazy?) to follow through every day.

I'm not comparing myself to others - it's pointless - but I know that reading about someone else's struggles can sometimes make us feel less alone. So, to give you an idea of where I come from and where I‚Äôm at now:

II‚Äôve been struggling with panic attacks for the past decade. The first one was triggered by a bad experience with a space cake. Since then, I‚Äôve gone through periods where I felt fine, no panic attacks for weeks or even months, only for them to return unexpectedly. The worst period lasted about two years. I was having panic attacks every single day, especially at night, which made me afraid to go to bed. t was brutal. I felt hopeless, like life had no meaning, and I was doomed. If it weren‚Äôt for my family and my faith, I might not be here today, not because I wanted to die, but because I just couldn‚Äôt see a reason to keep going.

On top of that, I have bipolar disorder and have gut issues, which are actually connected, most of the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù hormones are produced in the gut. It‚Äôs not always a psychological issue.

Like many of you, whenever I had a panic attack, I was convinced I was dying. Numbness in my arm? Must be paralysis. Lightheadedness? I‚Äôm losing control, I‚Äôll end up a vegetable. But here I am, 10 years later, and I‚Äôm still standing!

I promise you: there¬†is¬†hope for a better life.

This might be useless for some - maybe even most - but for anyone who needs it, here‚Äôs¬†my holy grail.

Please keep in mind, this isn‚Äôt an exhaustive list. I‚Äôm sure many people could add other helpful ideas. What I‚Äôve shared here is a collection of things that took me years to research and more importantly, to test and validate through my own experience.

I also asked chatgpt to help me summarize and translate it, since English isn‚Äôt my first language.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**1. Address Stress and Nervous System Regulation**

Chronic stress and an overactive sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight) can exacerbate panic attacks, anxiety, and bipolar mood swings. Your sense of disconnection may also tie to nervous system dysregulation or dissociation, common in high-stress states or bipolar disorder.



**Diaphragmatic Breathing** (5-10 minutes daily): Slow, deep belly breathing activates the vagus nerve, promoting parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) activity. Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Do this during moments of calm to build resilience and during panic attack onset to reduce intensity. Apps like Breathwrk can guide you.

Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR): Tense and release muscle groups systematically for 10-15 minutes daily. This reduces physical tension tied to anxiety and can ground you during disconnection episodes.

  
**Cold Exposure:** End your showers with 30-60 seconds of cold water. This stimulates the vagus nerve and may reduce anxiety over time by improving stress resilience. Start gradually to avoid overwhelm.

  
**Grounding Techniques for Disconnection:** When feeling detached, use the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. This anchors you in the present and counters dissociation.

Why it helps: These practices calm the autonomic nervous system, which is often hyperactive in anxiety, panic, and bipolar disorder. They‚Äôre quick, free, and can be done anywhere.



**Pannic Attack Tips:**  
**Ground Yourself in the Present (5-4-3-2-1 Technique)**

This distracts your mind from fear spirals, name:

* 5 things you can see
* 4 things you can touch
* 3 things you can hear
* 2 things you can smell
* 1 thing you can taste

**Breathe Low and Slow (Not Deep!)**  
Hyperventilation worsens panic. Instead:

* Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds
* Hold for 4 seconds
* Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6‚Äì8 seconds
* Repeat until your body starts to calm down

Tip: Place your hand on your **belly**, not your chest. You want the belly to rise, not the chest.

**Remind Yourself: It Will Pass**  
Say this mentally (or out loud if you're alone):

* ‚ÄúThis is just a panic attack.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMy body is reacting, but I am not in danger.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôve survived this before. It will end.‚Äù

[¬†**Kill the ANT technique**](https://www.amenclinics.com/blog/negative-thinking-do-you-have-an-ant-infestation-in-your-head/)¬† (D. Amen )

**Dunking Your Head in Water:**  
Holding your breath and putting cold water on your face, or just an ice pack, will trigger the diving reflex, which dramatically decreases your heart rate. Essentially all mammals have this reflex, from mice to humans to blue whales, which likely helps us stay underwater longer.

**2. Optimize Exercise for Mood and Anxiety**

Your current routine (fitness and running 3+ times a week) is excellent, as exercise boosts endorphins, reduces cortisol, and supports neuroplasticity. However, overtraining or high-intensity workouts can sometimes worsen anxiety or trigger panic in sensitive individuals, especially with bipolar disorder.

  


**Balance Intensity:** Mix moderate aerobic exercise (e.g., running at a conversational pace) with lower-intensity activities like yoga or walking. Yoga (e.g., Hatha or Yin) combines movement with breathwork, reducing anxiety and improving mood stability. Try a 20-minute yoga flow 1-2 times a week.  


Nature Exposure: Run or walk outdoors, ideally in green spaces. Studies show nature reduces amygdala activity (the brain‚Äôs fear center), helping with anxiety and disconnection. Aim for 20 minutes in a park or forest weekly.

Post-Workout Recovery: After intense sessions, practice 5 minutes of stretching or breathing to prevent nervous system overstimulation, which can mimic panic symptoms.

  
**Why it helps:** Exercise regulates serotonin and dopamine, which are disrupted in bipolar disorder  
and anxiety. Tailoring intensity and environment maximizes benefits without overloading your system.

  


**3. Support Gut Health to Improve Mental Health**

Your gut biome issues are significant, as the gut-brain axis influences mood, anxiety, and nervous system function. Poor gut health is linked to inflammation, which can worsen bipolar symptoms, anxiety, and dissociation.



**Dietary Adjustments:**

Increase Prebiotics and Probiotics: Eat fiber-rich foods (e.g., oats, bananas, onions, garlic) to feed healthy gut bacteria. Add fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, or kimchi 3-4 times a week. If accessible, consider a high-quality probiotic supplement (e.g., Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium strains), but food sources are priority.

  
**Reduce Inflammatory Foods:** Limit processed foods, sugar, and artificial sweeteners, which can disrupt gut flora and worsen mood swings. Replace sugary snacks with nuts, seeds, or fruit.

  
**Hydration:** Drink 2-3 liters of water daily to support digestion and reduce gut-related stress.

Meal Timing: Eat regular, balanced meals (e.g., protein, healthy fats, complex carbs) to stabilize blood sugar, which impacts mood and anxiety. Avoid skipping meals, especially with bipolar disorder, as low blood sugar can trigger irritability or panic.

  
**Caffeine Awareness:** If you drink coffee or energy drinks, limit to 1-2 cups early in the day. Caffeine can exacerbate anxiety, panic attacks, and bipolar mania.

  
**Why it helps:** A healthier gut reduces systemic inflammation and boosts serotonin production (90% of which is made in the gut), improving mood stability and reducing anxiety.

  


**4. Manage Bipolar Disorder Without Medication**

Bipolar disorder involves mood swings (manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes), which can amplify anxiety, panic, and disconnection. Non-medication strategies focus on stabilizing circadian rhythms and emotional regulation.



**Sleep Hygiene**: Aim for 7-9 hours of consistent sleep (same bedtime/wake time daily). Sleep disruption is a major trigger for bipolar episodes. Create a wind-down routine: dim lights, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, and try calming activities (e.g., reading, PMR). If disconnection occurs at night, keep a journal to ground thoughts.

  
**Mood Tracking:** Use a simple notebook, app or powerpoint to log daily mood, energy, and triggers (e.g., stress, poor sleep). This helps identify patterns and early warning signs of manic or depressive episodes. Share insights with a trusted friend for accountability.

Limit Overstimulation: During high-energy (hypomanic) phases, avoid overloading your schedule or making impulsive decisions. Channel energy into structured activities like running or creative hobbies. In low phases, focus on small, achievable tasks (e.g., 10-minute walk).

  
**Mindfulness (Cautiously):** Mindfulness meditation (5-10 minutes daily) can reduce anxiety and improve emotional awareness. However, intense meditation can destabilize mood in bipolar disorder, so stick to short, guided sessions (e.g., Headspace or Calm).

Why it helps: Consistent routines and self-awareness stabilize mood swings and reduce the intensity of anxiety and panic attacks.



**5. Build Emotional Connection to Counter Disconnection**

Your sense of disconnection may stem from anxiety, bipolar depressive phases, or chronic stress. Strengthening emotional and social grounding can help.



**Social Support:** Connect with a trusted friend, family member, or support group weekly, even briefly. Share your experiences or simply spend time together. Online communities (e.g., Reddit‚Äôs r/bipolar or r/anxiety) can offer solidarity, but avoid over-reliance.

  
**Creative Outlets:** Activities like journaling, drawing, or music can help process emotions and reduce dissociation. Try 10 minutes of free-writing daily to explore feelings of disconnection.

Pet or Nature Interaction: If you have a pet, spend time with them to boost oxytocin and grounding. If not, observing nature (e.g., birds, trees) during runs can foster connection.

Why it helps: Emotional engagement counters dissociation and stabilizes mood by activating reward and bonding pathways in the brain.



**6. Supplements**¬†

Safe & Potentially Helpful for Panic, Fatigue, Bipolar

**1. Magnesium (Glycinate or L-Threonate)**  
Why: Calms the nervous system, helps with sleep, reduces anxiety, stabilizes mood  
Dose: 200‚Äì400 mg/day (before bed is ideal)  
Note: Magnesium glycinate is calming; L-threonate crosses the blood-brain barrier for cognitive effects.

**2. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA-DHA)**  
Why: Anti-inflammatory, mood stabilizing, supports brain function  
Dose: 1‚Äì3 grams/day of EPA-dominant omega-3 (aim for at least 1,000 mg EPA)  
Note: Especially helpful in bipolar depression, less so for mania

**3. Vitamin D3**  
Why: Low levels are linked to depression and fatigue  
Dose: 1,000‚Äì2,000 IU/day (or based on blood test)  
Note: Get your levels tested if possible

For Panic Attacks & Anxiety

**4. L-Theanine**  
Why: Naturally calming, reduces anxiety without sedation  
Dose: 100‚Äì200 mg as needed  
Note: Often safe with bipolar, but always test slowly‚Äîcan be too calming in some

**5. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)**  
Why: Adaptogen; reduces cortisol and stress, improves sleep and energy  
Dose: 300‚Äì600 mg/day (KSM-66 or Sensoril extract)

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

One day, when three friends -Alex, Tom and Joseph- had gathered in a small caf√© to drinking tea and smoking cigarettes for a while, a difficult discussion took place between them.

Alex: ‚Äúcome on Tom, world is not ending. This time didn‚Äôt work, ok, you try again next year. If not next year, then after. You doesn't have to be sad. This look on your face had took us too. In my opinion you did a great job so far. Now is time to give yourself some rest and enjoy things already got.‚Äù
(Tom took a deep breath)

Joseph: ‚Äúdon't be too hard on him, give him a bit of time, his frowns will go away. I'm sure he didn‚Äôt mean to bring the energy down. Of course, poor guy is right too. hes been working hard lately to get ready for that exam, and it takes some time for tiredness go away. Tom, do you want me to order you one shot of that heavy coffee ? Maybe your cells wake up a bit more?‚Äù
(Tom smiled)

Tom: ‚ÄúJoseph, yes I used a lot of energy, but you know me, I don't give up this easy. Alex is right too, no way I let that chance next year slip away from me. Also I was thinking about finishing some projects I had before. Now I got more free time, I can really use it good and complete them. And now that you said it, I don‚Äôt mind having a good coffee. Go ahead, I'm waiting.‚Äù

Joseph: ‚Äúsure! Alex you also said you don't like coffee, right?‚Äù
(Joseph blinked at Tom)

Alex:‚ÄùMe? No way, I even chew coffee beans in my free time! Quick, give me a shot too, Tom‚Äôs words made me mad. Dude, relax a bit! I talked about next year just so you can rest and join me in some fun plans I made, not to pull out more unfinished projects from your pocket.
Now that we are here, I got a real question for you, don‚Äôt you ever get tired? Always pushing yourself with plans and lots of work? Life is short man. If you pressuring yourself like this all the time, you won‚Äôt really feel what life is. Life is these happy moments we have now, enjoying, forgetting the time. If we keep working non-stop, we miss our share of happiness. Even scientists say being happy and free is important for our health.‚Äù

Tom: ‚Äúto be honest, yes. But these things are easy for you to say, because you don't worry about future. You know in the end your father‚Äôs work and money is enough.‚Äù
(Alex gave a short smirk)

Joseph: ‚ÄúIf you ask me, I say what Tom is doing is valuable. One day he will marry, have kids, and more he earns, more he can make things better for people around him.‚Äù
(Tom frowned)

Tom: ‚Äúcan you stop, Joseph! I told you many times, specially to you, I don‚Äôt do all this to get more things or to help others live better. I want to reach a place in this world that I deserve. Everyone must know how much potential I have. I want that name, the one people around the world know. I want my memory to remains, even years after I die. So please, next time you talk about my motivation, be careful.‚Äù
(Joseph a bit shocked)

Tom: ‚Äúwhy you both try to change how I think? Did I mess with your lives? I don‚Äôt need your advice, I know what I‚Äôm doing. And by the way, Alex, your words are very childish. Almost everybody knows now that this fun and joy you talk about is pointless. Just waste of time. Do you really can, when the moment of your death comes, to ask yourself: What did I reach?‚Äù
(Alex laughed)

Alex: ‚Äúoh man, seems like you didn‚Äôt listen to me at all. Fine. Let‚Äôs each of us build what we want, I‚Äôll enjoy every moment of life, and you enjoy that big final moment you dream to be glorious.‚Äù
(they remained silent for a while, and each one drinked their tea)

Joseph: ‚ÄúGuys, now seriously, this topic really made me think. Let‚Äôs stop fighting like roosters and continue with more patience. In my eyes, both of you are kind people. When I hear your words and see that your motivation is just about yourselves, I wonder how you can also be selfless without any efforts. Like remember those days at the game-net? Only two people can play, and even if I try give my turn to you, we all know I become a spoiled kid and even force to play when it‚Äôs not my turn. That is not all, I saw many times you forgive easily. Before, I thought maybe you both have same values of me but you do it better. But now I wonder, maybe I forgot something fundamental. Please stop being angry and let‚Äôs explore this more.‚Äù
(Tom puts his arm on Joseph's shoulder)

Tom: ‚ÄúLook who becames our philosopher! Alright bro, you know I love you. That way you ask, how can I say no? I have thoughts too, but let‚Äôs see what our handsome Alex has to say.‚Äù
(Alex smiled)

Alex: ‚ÄúWell, past seconds I was also thinking. I feel like all three of us are feeling an emptiness. And we each escape from it in our own way. I run after joy, Tom runs after success, and Joseph thinks he must become a good man. I don‚Äôt know, it just come to me suddenly. Honestly I can‚Äôt help more with this deep thoughts, even now my brain is overheating. If it's useful, take it. But about myself I can say, as a kid, no one told me I must get a title or be famous. Even my parents didn‚Äôt push me to act special just to show love. I just did norm‚Ä¶‚Äù
(Joseph interrupted him)

Joseph: ‚ÄúThe first part of your words really made sense to me. Yeah, very true. Good job. But I‚Äôm sure even you, don‚Äôt know where you went after that.‚Äù
(both looked at Alex then three laughed together)

Joseph: ‚ÄúTom, if you don‚Äôt want to continue and add to Alex‚Äôs point, I want to talk now.‚Äù
(Tom raised one palm)

Tom: ‚ÄúWait. Let me speak so you see I was going to say the same things as you, maybe even better. Alex, with all his craziness, said something true without knowing. I clearly saw a kind of emptiness there. As kids, when they teach us to reach something in future so we become valuable, our mind understands this: if we can become more valuable in future, then now we are less valuable. That‚Äôs how we start to feel empty inside.‚Äù
(a soft smile unconsciously appeared on all lips)

Joseph: ‚ÄúBravo Tom, you said it better than anyone. Now that Alex planted the seed, and you brought the grapes, let me make the wine by saying the finishing words. First, in Alex‚Äôs case, since no outside values were forced on him, he start thinking that fun games are real joy. And later, he made other pleasures in life feel like values. Second, now I see how these values work. Actually, I want to call them ‚Äòvalueless values‚Äô because they deserve that name. Even if we reach these no-real values, they will come again, if they are goals ""better of them"", or if they are pleasures ""more pleasure"", they show again in new future. So, the first way we chose (to reach that future to feel full value), it doesn‚Äôt fix anything. It even makes this hurt be forever. Third, that‚Äôs why I, who felt lack of selflessness all the time, couldn‚Äôt act right. And you, who didn‚Äôt feel that lack, because you didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something to get later, could easily be selfless.

There was a stage inside the park. A man was standing on it, facing away toward the grass. I glanced at him while walking. The moment I stared at him for more than five seconds, he turned around‚Äîwithout moving his legs‚Äîalmost like he was levitating. I quickly looked forward and kept walking because he seemed scary and huge.

I had almost exited the narrow path when he said, ‚ÄúWait, son.‚Äù
I turned back and did the ‚Äúme?‚Äù gesture with my finger.
He jumped off the stage and walked toward me, saying, ‚ÄúYes, love.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt tell his exact height, but he was taller than me (and I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù). His face was not... stable. It felt like watching a YouTube video in 2012 with bad internet.

As he approached me, he said, ‚ÄúI am God.‚Äù
I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Pope. Nice to meet you.‚Äù
He slapped me.

‚ÄúPoint proven,‚Äù I blurted.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúI believe Putin is God,‚Äù I replied.

Suddenly, I felt like I was going to vomit. He stared at me and opened his mouth. I tried to walk away to avoid disgusting him, but I couldn‚Äôt move. My mouth slowly opened, and something black came out of me‚Äîa very, very black ball. It floated out and hovered between us. I felt incredibly weak.

He said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your dirty soul.‚Äù
I answered, ‚ÄúYeah, I mix cereals in coffee.‚Äù
He slapped me again.

He started licking the black ball. With each lick, it grew brighter. After three or four minutes, it was glowing brighter than a bulb. I thanked him. I felt lighter‚Äîlike he had given me a new life. The soul returned to my body, and I felt so strong. I started jumping, maybe from an adrenaline rush. He stood there watching me. But as soon as I stopped, he vanished.

1koopw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1koopw5/pietro_vs_zp6_side_by_side_from_a_layman/,Pietro vs zp6 side by side from a layman,"TLDR: Did a side-by-side comparison of the Pietro versus the ZP6 this morning with a washed Kenyan that I‚Äôm not a huge fan of and didn‚Äôt mind wasting while I attempted to dial it in.

Summary: dialed by tbt, identified differences in presentation and perceived intensity, but minimal differences in the specific notes themselves that were presented.


It ended up not mattering that I chose a bean I had a lot of, as I struck gold on the first try and found out that 8.0 on my Pietro and 5.0 on my ZP6 resulted in the exact same one minute 48 second drawdown- like actually identical. One bloom for 45 seconds followed by a single pour starting on the outside and then in the center once all the grounds were wet. 13.3:200 with no rdt so that the chaff/fines that got stuck could be thrown out, which is much easier on the Pietro than zp6.

Tasting: first let me say that I am quite familiar with this coffee, as I just went on vacation and only brought this for my partner and myself. It is not a particularly good or bad coffee, probably just a solid 84-85 if that. It‚Äôs just a standard washed Kenyan. Nothing to write home about, but not unpleasant either. However I got to sample twice as many cups as I usually would from this kilo, as I made a ton for my partner and myself within the past two weeks while I cupped it or brewed it on aeropress with varying parameters(since I was traveling, nothing was particularly consistent). This meant I tried their cups as well as my own quite often‚Äî this means the good and the bad brews. 

Me: My preferences lean towards acidity, maintaining body and clarity whenever possible, and sweetness. I prefer fresh or dried fruit notes over florals and nuts, and often I enjoy a nice fermented note, as long as it‚Äôs got complexity. I have used the zp6 for about two years, and the Pietro for 3-4 months now. 

On to results:
Zp6: clean, inoffensive, standard. This tasted very similar to a typical heptagonal burr set brewed as immersion, and then with bypass added. Solid, sweetness, solid body. The only tasting note that really pops out to me is a black tea note, which is nice to have in a brew with body. The flavor starts off quite pleasant and then as it becomes an aftertaste it becomes inoffensively brown, but not quite roasty. 


Pietro: it‚Äôs worth noting that I brewed this one second, so I had had a chance to taste the ZP6 brew a little bit more, and I might be suffering from tasting fatigue a bit. 

Pietro has less sweetness, less body by a smidge, and much more pleasant lingering aftertaste. Oddly enough, minimal differences in acidity in this brew. While I would describe the flavor intensity of the zp6 as beginning strong and tapering off, the most noticeable difference I get at first is that the pietro starts off much weaker and less tactile, but sticks around with full intensity longer. This is why I say that it has less body ‚Äúby a smidge‚Äù, since it actually has a good amount less body, but presents it for longer. The aftertaste is also much more pleasant, until it becomes just the generic taste of coffee in my mouth, and then I start to notice roast defects or maybe brew defects. There is definitely much more presence of the typical blackcurrant Kenyan profile here, but the black tea note balances it out. There is also a white flower flavor buried in there, but difficult to discern. It is at this point that I believe that the tasting becomes hindered by the fact I‚Äôm using a subpar bean. 

You could absolutely dial these in to taste quite similar for this bean in particular by using a coarser grind and more beans on the zp6.  

Other notes from non-side-by-side comparisons:

- When brewing, a natural coffee, the Pietro leans towards a literal ‚Äúfruit juice‚Äú presentation, while the ZP6 remains slightly blendier and less acidic. I prefer the Pietro by quite a bit for naturals and funky coffee. 

- The ZP6 takes a little bit of effort to dial in, the Pietro ends up being a good cup 90% of the time regardless of what I do. The other 10% are pretty lackluster though, typically not having enough flavor intensity and tasting overly tea like, in the sense that there‚Äôs no intensity. It‚Äôs probably water temp at that point. 

- the Pietro can push extraction much much more than the zp6, which I typically do by lengthening bloom time. At the same perceived intensity, the zp6 leans towards muddier, dirtier flavors, hay, and cardboard. However this is a double edged sword, since if the bean is the issue, the Pietro brew will taste like grass and wood town at higher extraction. 

- the Pietro excels almost all the time at one grind setting, while the zp6 needs to be dialed in, and as you go finer, this introduces some unpleasant flavors. This is likely user error though. 

- I am trying my best, but true objectivity is not possible. I am likely biased towards my expensive new-ish grinder, which is why I waited to do this until ‚Äúnew toy‚Äù syndrome went away. 

And that‚Äôs about it! Please bear in mind that this is just a comparison of a singular generic coffee, not a particularly immaculate bean. I thought this was good to run a comparison on since it‚Äôs not a very roasted or unpleasant bean to begin with. Also, please note that this is just a comparison of the same coffee, recipe, water, and ratio at a targeted drawdown time, I did not bust out the refractometer or dial by taste. Both of these grinders perform quite well when dialed in, but that was not the goal here the goal was to highlight differences at the same general extraction, not how to get each grinder to perform the best. 

Please drop any questions or feedback and I‚Äôll do my best to answer! Hope this helps someone!",8,1747472992.0,pourover,5,0.9,False

have stopped pretending we‚Äôre strangers.
We‚Äôve been
cohabiting in the space
between who I thought I‚Äôd be
and who I‚Äôm too tired to become.

At first,
I treated it like a hostage situation.
White flag raised in the shape of group chats.
SOS flares fired through Instagram stories

Loneliness brews my coffee
exactly how I like it‚Äî
bitter, black, no lies.

It doesn‚Äôt interrupt me mid-thought
or make me feel like a backup plan

It just‚Ä¶
lets me be.

And isn‚Äôt that what we wanted?

To be seen
without being edited?
To sit in silence
without being asked
‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

It‚Äôs tragic, really.
How solitude used to taste like rust
and now it tastes like
relief.

Like no longer stretching myself

not enough.

Loneliness is a strange kind of lover.
It doesn‚Äôt ghost,
doesn‚Äôt cheat,
doesn‚Äôt promise things it won‚Äôt deliver.
It just sits beside me
quietly,
waiting for me to stop
trying to be likable.

I laugh a little more now.
Not because I‚Äôm happy,
but because the irony is rich‚Äî

of being alone.
Now I‚Äôm afraid
of being found

For a grinder I‚Äôm running a DF64 Gen2 DLC.

I usually brew light roasts, occasionally medium roasts, almost never dark roasts. My standard routine is 2 milk drinks in the morning, the same 2 milk drinks around lunch and then sometimes a decaf espresso/milk drink in the afternoon. Of course, from time to time we have some family over so the amount of espressos may increase to 5-6 at a time.

What I‚Äôm worried about is the ability to fine-tune the temperature on the Mara since it only has the three temp settings as opposed to a PiD with LCD on the Bianca and also about the stability when pulling 4-6 shots in a sequence. How much of an issue is it or is it good enough to brew light roasts? Does the upgrade to the Bianca warranty basically double the price? I can get the Mara for around 1200eur while the Bianca would set me back 2400-2500eur.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind waiting a bit for the temp to go up to steam milk after pulling 2 shots of espresso, I am also fine with a smart plug to turn the machine on in the morning and if I need coffee on demand (which is not that often), I am okay to wait for the Bianca to heat up.

Not going to plumb it in, I‚Äôm using bottled water.

Can the steam power be compared, or not? Is the dual boiler really a huge difference for a home setup? I like the idea of being able to pre-program pre-infusion, control the flow on the Bianca but I‚Äôm just wondering how much of a difference does it make? I usually get only 250g bags of specialty coffee so I like to switch around beans during the day - hence the single dose grinder.

Any advice from Mara or Bianca owners is welcome.

PS: I was considering the Elizabeth as well as a dual bioler but I must say, I really like the looks of the Mara or Bianca, also I‚Äôve read they had some issues and they are not really stocked in central europe (Slovakia) as opposed to either the Mara or Bianca being in stock pretty mych everywhere with varying price.",1,1747472200.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**Dylan's POV**

*Ring*

""Hmmmmm""

*ringggg*

""Ughhhh""

I lazily groaned out as the sound of my stupid alarm decided to get me out of a restless sleep.

Why am I acting like this?, today was the day..... my first day of teaching at the university. I had spent years preparing for this moment, but now that it was finally here, I couldn't shake off the feeling of nervousness that had been building up inside me.

I'm a shy person, and why I choose to teach is still a mystery to me, I don't think I can't get a word out without stuttering, so how am I supposed to teach students who are old enough to find my awkwardness funny but rather embarrassing and worth laugh AT me.

As I lay in bed, I couldn't help but think about all the things that could go wrong. What if I stumbled over my words?, like my stupid stuttering issue kicks in, it always does that when I'm in a crowd or speaking to people.

What if I forgot my notes? What if the students didn't like me?. The doubts swirled in my head like a vortex, making my stomach twist with anxiety and my¬† heart beat faster. I really don't have time for a panic attack right now or today.

I took a deep breath and threw off the covers, trying to shake off the negative thoughts. Nina said a negative mind results to unnecessary heart breaks and self sabotage. Nina is my nanny or as I've grown to call her, my adoptive mother who stepped up. She's such a sweet old lady, when I came out to my parents years ago- okay I didn't really come out to them, I kinda sorta, kissed one of their business partners son- they dumped me in this apartment with her, but years ago before college she moved out so she could give me privacy, privacy that I really could care less about since there's nothing to be kept private.....well except my little secret.

Anyways, I had prepared for this moment, I keep trying to remind myself. I had spent countless hours poring over my notes, rehearsing my lectures, and preparing engaging lesson plans. I was ready for this. Ready to show these students there's more to art than just covering a white board with colors.

I love art, it was how I was able to express myself without having to actually express it. My favorite thing about art is that it doesn't always have to be lines, colors and a board. Art can be music, writing, photography, etc. my favorite form of art though would be drawing/painting, whenever I stood in front of a canvas it always feels right. I had always loved art, art can be found anywhere and my favorite place to see art was on the human body.

Getting back on track, I got out of bed and began my morning routine, trying to focus on the tasks at hand rather than my racing thoughts. I showered, did my skin care routine, and dressed in my best professorial attire.

As I made my way to the kitchen to make some coffee, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked a bit pale and nervous, my eyes sunken from lack of sleep. I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself, reminding myself that I was capable and competent. I'm not really used to sleeping alone, years after Nina left and I still can't get used to sleeping alone, sometimes I would cuddle with my teddy bears to feel the warmth and safety of someone but deep down I knew it wasn't the same.

I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down at the kitchen table, trying to collect my thoughts. I went over my notes one last time, making sure I had everything I needed for the day's lecture.

But despite my best efforts, the nervousness lingered. What if I wasn't good enough? What if I failed?, what if my parents are right?, that I'm just a huge disappointment.

I pushed the thoughts aside and stood up, finishing my coffee in one gulp. It was time to face the music. I grabbed my bag and headed out the door, taking a deep breath as I stepped into the unknown-well not really unknown, but you get the drill-.

.....

As I was leaving my apartment, lost in thought about my first day of teaching, I didn't notice the person standing in the hallway. That was, until I bumped into him.

""Oh, I'm so sorry!"" I exclaimed, as I stumbled backward, trying to regain my balance, my face heating from embarrassment, I literally can not have this today.

The man, my neighbor, looked at me with a mixture of surprise and annoyance. ""Watch where you're going, shorty"" he said gruffly.

I felt my face heat up even more with more embarrassment. ""I'm really sorry,"" I repeated, trying to make amends. ""I wasn't paying attention."" He's huge, what if he beats me up, I really can't defend myself, the least or in my case, most thing I can do is yell for help and I doubt I'd be able to.

My neighbor, a tall, handsome, dark skin man with a beard, looked me up and down, I've never seen him before, maybe he's new¬† ""You're done staring?"" he said, his tone still the same, annoyed and irritated. ""I'm sorry."" I rushed out, I don't want his trouble. At all.

""I'm...uh...Dylan,"" I introduced myself, trying to hide my awkwardness and lighten the mood.

""And I care why?"" He asked me with a more annoyed face, it's like he knows of no other expression except annoyance, he's so tall and huge, he must work out everyday, I bet his whole hand can lift and throw me away.

We stood there for a moment, awkwardly silent. I didn't know what to say, and the man seemed to be enjoying my discomfort, because his face soften a bit and now he's rocking a light smirk on his face.

I thought he was going to do something but instead he just scoffed and started walking away.

""You're just going to stand there and wait for the next neighbor to annoy?"" Came his voice as he stepped into the elevator.

""I....i"" was what left my mouth

""You....you"" he mimicked, the door was about to close but he held it back opened.

""Get in"" he ordered and like the pushover and submissive I am, I immediately rushed inside.

The door closed and he pressed ground floor. I tried so hard not to stare at him but i could feel his aura, he's so tall and huge, he can seriously squeeze my body in the shape of a ball or any object he wants to.

We rode the elevator in awkward silence, which was disturbed by my loud gulping of my saliva. I felt him staring hard at me. Making me want to seek protection from the elevator walls.

Finally we reached the ground floor

""Sorry again."" I rushed out as I bid him good bye, rushing to my car.

I glanced back at him one more time before entering my car, he's so handsome, too bad he's not gay and I don't have the balls to pursue anything.

I shook my head, chuckling wryly to myself. This was not how I wanted to start my day.

I took a deep breath and continued on my way, hoping that the rest of the day would be less stressful.

.......

As I walked into the classroom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had made it to my first day of teaching, my parents were so wrong, I will become something, maybe now I can finally stop accepting their money and start my own life.

I was ready to take on the world, I can do anything.

WORLD, HERE I COMEEEEEE.... I happily yelled in my head, I was happy and nothing can ruin it for me....

That was, until I almost tripped over my own feet.

I was so focused on greeting my students and setting up my notes that I didn't notice the loose wire on the floor. My feet got tangled in it, and I stumbled, almost falling over. I managed to catch myself just in time, but not before I let out a loud, awkward ""whoa!"" I awkward chucked, But boy was I embarrassed. I wish the floor would open and just sink me in.

The students looked up at me in surprise, and I could feel my face burning with embarrassment.

I tried to play it cool, laughing it off and making a joke about ""getting the clumsiness out of the way early."" But inside, I was mortified, I wanted to die. Angel of death where are you.

I quickly composed myself and began the lecture, trying to shake off the awkwardness. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I had already made a fool of myself in front of my students. I stumbled over my words a few times, and my hands shook slightly as I wrote on the board.

""Good morning class"" I greeted, forcing myself to stay calm.

""My name is Dylan Mathew, I will be your art teacher for the semester"" my shaking hands pointed to my name and the course code written on the board.

""Please do feel free to think of me as one of you but not too much to forget I am not one of you"" I awkward laughed to which I was replied with silence.

""Okayyy"" I then began teaching today's topic. Or in the eyes of the students, trying to teach. I'm so nervous I don't think I know what I'm doing.

Despite my best efforts, the rest of the class was a blur. I couldn't focus on the material, and I couldn't shake the feeling of embarrassment. I just wanted to get out of there and start over.

As the class finally came to a close, I breathed a sigh of relief. I had made it through the first day, but I knew I had a long way to go. I gathered my things and headed out of the classroom, hoping that tomorrow would be a better day.

As I walked out of the room, I heard a few snickers and giggles from the students. I couldn't help but smile, realizing that maybe, just maybe, my awkwardness had helped break the ice.

Or maybe they're just making fun of me. My smile immediately dropped and I hung my head in shame as I walked to my assigned office.

# Chapter Two

**Von's POV**

I woke up to the sound of sucking and pleasure running through my body, I groaned out in satisfaction as I opened my legs a bit more for the person to continue sucking my dick.

I looked down and stared at the light skin shorty on her knees, in front of me forcing herself to deep throat my dick. She was slurping it but she wasn't doing it how I wanted.

I ran my hand through her hair, making her look at me, she had a happy look in her eyes, that was sweet, she thinks she's getting appreciated for a good job.

I smirked at her before forcing her throat down, shoving my dick deeper into her mouth, I watched her gag but I didn't take my hand from her head.

""Fuck"" I groaned out as I held her hair and started thrusting into her mouth, she looked up at me with teary eyes but sadly for her, it only turned me on, watching her try to catch her breath, her breath hitched, her face red and eyes teary, it was a beautiful sight to behold. But too bad she's not enjoying it.

I removed my hand from her head making her remove her mouth from my dick and gasp for air.

""What the fuck Von"" she exclaimed, her hand on her naked chest as she tried to catch her breath, her eyes were glaring at me now.

""You weren't doing it right"" I shrugged before getting out of bed, why the fuck is she complaining, she followed me home last night and I specifically told her, I don't do gentle loving, so what did she expect when she takes my dick..MY DICK in her mouth trying to pleasure me and doesn't even do it properly, am I supposed to sit there and let her waste my time?.

And it wasn't like I went gentle with her yesterday night. And the marks on her body shows it, I had asked for consent and she gave it to me, I told her I was a dominant and in her words...

""I've never been with someone into that life style before, but I guess we can try"" she replied back to me yesterday when I had told her about my life style.

She's lucky I didn't take her to the room, pretty sure she would have been scared off.

I stumbled my naked self to the bathroom, my head pounding from the hangover. I splashed some water on my face, trying to shake off the lingering fogginess. Why did I drink so much? And why did I bring her back here?,

As I brushed my teeth, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked like crap. Dark circles under my eyes.

I walked over to the shower and turned it on, ready to shower when i heard the bathroom door open and I knew just who was about to enter, and I wasn't too happy about it because for three things.

1. she already pissed me the fuck off a few minutes ago
2. I don't like people showering with me, unless they want to lose their ability to walk out of that bathroom.
3. and most importantly, WHY IS SHE STILL HERE.

I let out a frustrated groan when I saw her walk towards the shower, her naked body swaying left to right as she tried to walk seductively.

She's one beautiful woman, I won't lie, but it's a shame she's not what I'm looking for.

You see I'm a dominant, and a little bit on the Sadistic side, I like to dominate my partner, I want them to give me full ownership of their body, you know trust me with their body, heart and soul. I want them to only get pleasure from my hands, mouth and dick, I don't want them knowing what the touch of another man feels like. I want their body to know, memorize my touch, I want them and their body to crave my touch.

I've slept with my fair share of men and women and I've still not found the one who my body and heart craves for. And it gets frustrating honestly.

I gave her a straight face as I watched her try to come near me.

""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" I asked her. I just want to shower and get to my fucking class, today is Monday and I'm honestly not in the mood for all this

""I'm just trying to take a shower daddy"" she seductively says, her hand trailed from my neck to my chest while she stared at me with what I assume is her ""seductive"" eyes.

""And you can do that in your place"" I carefully removed her hand from my body, I really don't have time for this shit. I went back to my showering, I could feel her staring at me and I really could care less.

""So I'm just supposed to watch you shower?"" She asked me, but I paid no mind to her, I know damn well I told her ass to go back home, so why she's still here is foreign to me.

""Stare or whatever, I really don't care. Your ass isn't even supposed to be here"" I smacked my teeth in frustration. She's beginning to irritate me and I didn't like that.

I continued showering when I heard her walk out my bathroom, slamming the door to show her anger but I didn't react, I wanted her out of here and I wanted her gone fast.

......

I stepped out of shower, dried myself and wrapped my towel around my waist. I got out and saw she was still here, why did I have to wake up with this...this...person in my bed?. Like did I know she would be this annoying, because if I did, I wouldn't have taken her back to my place. I groaned as I stared at her, she heard me and still didn't attempt to move. Great, just what I needed. A reminder of my own stupidity, I should have taken her back to her place or at least fucked her in my car or something. Why did I have to be so stupid.

I walked to my walk in closet and started getting dressed.

I walked back into the bedroom, where she was still on, typing away on her phone. ""Time to go,"" I growled out,m, trying to sound as unpleasant as possible so that she'll take me serious this time, she's really irritating me and I don't like that. Just looking at her is making me have an itch in my brain.

She looked up at me, bleary-eyed, and smiled. ""You won't even offer me breakfast?,"" she asked trying to sound cute but honestly it just made me more angry.

Breakfast? I should offer her breakfast? Where the fuck does she think she is?....a bed and breakfast?

""Do I look like I want you here,"" I spoke truthfully glaring at her, grabbing her clothes from the floor, I¬†shoved them at her. ""It's time for you to fucking go.""

""You've made me repeat it more than once"" I firmly spoke

""And I hate repeating myself"" I really did, especially when it's to adults who are fully capable of hearing me speak.

She looked taken aback by my tone, I know, because she slightly flinched at me, but thankfully, she didn't argue. She quickly got dressed and gathered her things and walked out the door, she looked back at me maybe hoping I'd call her back.

I walked towards the door, her eyes lit up with hope, but I smiled at her and shut the door behind her. Finally, I was alone. Now I could get ready for that stupid class in peace. And maybe, just maybe, I could shake off this hangover. I really need to stop being weirdos to my place.

......

I walked out of my apartment, a frown formed on my face. I really can't wait to be done with this school stuff. It wasn't that i was dumb or anything, it was just that I didn't care for school, but my parents do, especially my father.

He made a deal with me, if I go through school and graduate top of my class and study the course he chose, I can have everything I want. And I did just that. I made sure to top my classes.

My father is a really strict man, and when he says one thing, nothing can change his mind or opinion. So if me studying and getting good results means I'll have my many cars, my apartment flat, the access to the private jet, yatch and helicopter. Then I guess I actually have to take this school thing and studying serious I guess.

Due to reading all the horror stories and reading about how traumatising it was, I want to tell you about my experience. 

**Pre banding**

Initially, like many others I started researching. I read horror stories about just how painful it was. I was really scared and told the doctor about my fear. He immediately told me none of his patients ever had such experiences and that it would be uncomfortable at most. This placed me at ease. He also told me that improper banding could lead to pain when the banding is placed too low. He assured me this wouldn't happen.

**The procedure**

I was told to take off my pants and lay on my side. The nurse helped me with breathing techniques while a device was inserted into the anus. It's definitely bigger than a finger but they used a creme to soothen the feeling. It felt like the I had a really bad urge to visit the bathroom, no pain was experienced. I even drove home by myself, no problem. After about 60 seconds the banding was done and I could leave. I felt nothing but an urge for a number 2. 

**Post procedure (1-6 hours)**

I felt a 5/10 discomfort. Just for 6 full hours, a big urge for a number 2. No pain whatsoever. After 6 hours when I finally had to go for a number 2 for real this time, I noticed that my stool had a single drop off blood, and it felt ''sour'', but no real pain. I would say 3/10. When I did go, it felt like a relieve and the great urge to go was also mostly gone. I applied hot tissues to wash my bums in fear pulling the bands.

**The next days**

I drink a lot of coffee and fibers to guarantee a smooth stool. You'll still need to be careful but I honestly couldn't tell you I had banding if I didn't know.  The discomfort is only 2/10 while going to the toilet because you feel a bit of a stretch around the anus. 

**Additional tips**

Please tell your doctor about why you feel uncomfortable, it can really help. Ask him about the creme they might use because the creme really soothenes the experience. I also recommend a high fiber diet along with 4-5 coffees a day. This way you should be able to go for a number 2 without using real pressure.

Not What I Signed Up For üòÇ,"So there I was, swiping through the usual suspects on my dating app while half-watching another true crime documentary. I matched with this guy, and he seemed pretty normal (or so I thought). Honestly, I should've known from his bio: ""Looking for someone down-to-earth, loves nature, and good listener,"" but I was too wooed by the solo hiking pics. 

We agreed to meet up for coffee. He suggested this cute little place he claimed was his ""favorite spot""... definitely a hipster coffee shop with chairs you can't sit in comfortably for more than 20 minutes. Anyway, we're there, chatting about life, jobs, and our dogs (classic, right?).

But suddenly, the convo takes a turn... This guy starts unloading his entire life story about his exes. Apparently, one of them ""just didn't understand"" his passion for collecting novelty mugs. I tried to be supportive (or at least look interested while sipping on my overpriced latte), but before I knew it, bam! I'm knee-deep in a one-sided therapy session. 

He dives into how his last three relationships went south, pulling out imaginary graphs with reasons like ""didn‚Äôt appreciate my creative side"" and ""never brewed coffee right."" I'm nodding like a bobblehead, trying to throw in advice here and there, but mostly just wondering how my life decisions led to public coffee shop therapy ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Eventually, I managed to steer the convo back to neutral territory, talking about our favorite books. But, lesson learned!

I‚Äôm throwing this out into the universe because‚Ä¶ well, closed mouths don‚Äôt get fed, right? My absolute dream phone is the Samsung‚ÄØZ‚ÄØFlip‚ÄØ3, and I‚Äôm hoping someone out there might get the same rush from surprising a stranger as I would from finally holding this gadget in my hands. Here‚Äôs why the Flip‚ÄØ3 has me star‚Äëeyed‚Äîand why gifting it would create maximum good‚Äëvibes ROI:

1. Pocket Powerhouse, Literally
	‚Ä¢	Compact magic: It folds down small enough to slip into skinny‚Äëjean pockets or those fake pockets on women‚Äôs clothes (why do they do that to us? üôÉ).
	‚Ä¢	Full‚Äësize screen: Unfolded, it‚Äôs a gorgeous 6.7‚Äù Dynamic¬†AMOLED‚Äîperfect for Reddit doom‚Äëscrolls and bingeing K‚Äëdrama in bed.

2. Aesthetic Goals

	‚Ä¢	Selfie stand: Half‚Äëfold = instant tripod. My vanity (and my Instagram grid) will thank you.

3. Productivity Upgrade
	‚Ä¢	Hands‚Äëfree mode: Prop it up on a desk for Zoom classes, recipe videos in the kitchen, or midnight ASMR sessions‚Äîno PopSocket gymnastics required.
	‚Ä¢	Multi‚Äëwindow: Split‚Äëscreen lets me take notes and watch lectures at the same time. My GPA would honestly get a glow‚Äëup.

4. Longevity & Eco‚Äëkarma
	‚Ä¢	IPX8 water resistance: Spilled coffee? Rainy walks? Safe.
	‚Ä¢	Armor Aluminum frame + Gorilla Glass Victus: Translation: it can survive my ‚Äúoops‚Äù moments longer than my current cracked phone ever did‚Äîless e‚Äëwaste, more planet love. üåç

5. The Feels

I‚Äôm a full‚Äëtime student hustling between labs, side gigs, and trying to keep my mental health afloat. Treating myself to a $900+ phone isn‚Äôt in the cards right now‚Äîbut the productivity boost, confidence bump, and daily joy this device would bring? Priceless.

Say something in the comments and I‚Äôll share.","**I Married His Rival After He Proposed to Her**

**Chapter 1 I'm Not My Boyfriend's Bride-to-be**

""I'll marry you, Mr. Foster.""

Yvonne Scott made this call after downing half a bottle of wine.

There was silence on the other end of the line before a deep, annoyed voice, rough from sleep, finally replied.

""Do you realize what time it is?""

Yvonne hadn't paid attention and quickly checked her phone‚Äîit was already 2:00 a.m.

""Sorry about that. I'll call back tomorrow.""

""Alright. My wife-to-be""

""Huh?""

""By the way, I'm heading overseas for a business trip tomorrow. I'll be away for about a month. Once I'm back, we can register for marriage.""

""Okay.""

After ending the call, Yvonne felt a little lightheaded.

A couple of weeks earlier, her aunt from the countryside gave her a call, eager to introduce her to a potential boyfriend, Hendrix Foster.

He was the grandson of their neighbor, Laurel Reed.

He had been an outstanding student since childhood. After graduating from a university in Northville, he landed a high-paying job with an excellent work-life balance and ample growth opportunities.

Although Yvonne had agreed verbally at that time, she didn't take it seriously and only intended to go along with the suggestion out of politeness. However, that very evening, Hendrix contacted her. He bluntly stated that he wasn't interested in blind dates or dating and proposed skipping straight to marriage if she was willing.

""Is he crazy?""

That was her only thought at that time.

Before she could respond, he told her to think it over and abruptly ended the call.

In truth, Yvonne hadn't given it any thought over the past two weeks. But tonight, she decided to say yes.

Meanwhile, the internet was abuzz with trending news.

The famous actress, Eliana Watson, was rumored to be pregnant, with speculation that the father was a married Best Actor.

Shortly after Eliana was labeled a 'mistress' and became a trending topic, the second heir of the Jackmans, Zaid, stepped forward to clarify. He announced that Eliana was his only and one girlfriend, and the baby she was carrying was his. They were planning to get married soon.

Facing skepticism from many netizens, he released a video as proof. The footage at Eliana's recent birthday party showed him kneeling to propose.

This revelation flipped public opinion. Fans and netizens alike began to offer their blessings.

The top trending topic was ""Zaid Jackman and Eliana Watson are gonna get married"".

Yvonne glanced at it and felt a pang of irony.

*If Eliana is his only and one girlfriend, then what about me?*

*What about the eight years I have spent by his side?*

Realizing her foolishness, Yvonne decided it was time to stop it.

Her decision to marry Hendrix had stemmed from his simple but heartfelt words.

""I want to live an ordinary life with my wife‚Äîsupporting each other, respecting one another, and growing old together.""

It was her desired life, but Zaid had never been willing to give it to her.

With her thoughts sorted, Yvonne began packing her belongings.

The villa belonged to Zaid, so she needed to move out quickly.

Since Yvonne had to work an early shift, she only managed to get a couple of hours of sleep before waking up.

When she went downstairs, she noticed Zaid sprawled on the couch, his hair a mess and his face tense. It was clear he'd had too much to drink last night and was still feeling the effects.

Choosing to ignore him, she headed into the kitchen to prepare breakfast.

While she was cooking pasta, Zaid stumbled in, reeking of alcohol. He hugged her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder.

""Ugh, my head is killing me. Make me a cup of coffee,"" he mumbled.

Yvonne went into the kitchen, pulled a can from the top shelf of the cabinet, and inside was his favorite coffee beans. He only drank freshly ground coffee, so whenever he wanted some, she would grind the beans and brew it slowly.

Once it was done, she added milk, and while she was pouring the latte art, she couldn't help but laugh at herself. She'd been making coffee for eight years‚Äîenough to warm his stomach, but not his heart. As she finished a heart shape, she couldn't resist drawing a long line through the center of it.

When Zaid came out of the shower, Yvonne placed the coffee in front of him. He quietly picked it up, seemingly not planning to explain what had happened last night. When he noticed the long line in the heart, that was when Yvonne broke the silence.

""Congratulations.""

Zaid glanced up, his handsome face showing a hint of confusion. ""What for?""

She answered calmly, ""For proposing to Eliana on her birthday again and finally getting a yes after all these years.""

She had always known about Zaid's feelings for Eliana. His love had spanned 15 years, beginning when they were in junior high.

Every year on Eliana's birthday, he proposed to her. Even during the eight years he had been with Yvonne, that pattern hadn't changed.

Yvonne had cared deeply, of course. But her love for Zaid had been so self-sacrificial that she endured it.

Zaid's expression darkened. ""You've seen the news, haven't you?""

Yvonne didn't respond, simply meeting his gaze.

After a moment, he nodded and said nonchalantly, ""Eliana and I are only entering into a fake marriage. Once the media frenzy dies down, we'll get divorced.""

""A fake marriage?"" Yvonne was momentarily speechless and smiled. ""Will there be a marriage certificate? A wedding?""

""Obviously. Without them, neither of our families would agree to it.""

""Then how is it a fake marriage?"" she questioned.

""It'll be fake. There's no need for you to understand everything."" After sipping the coffee, Zaid stood and headed toward the stairs.

Yvonne stopped him. ""I have no interest in interfering with your choices, but we need to settle things between us.""

Zaid turned back, his tone impatient. ""What are you trying to say?""

Taking a steadying breath, she replied, ""Let's break up.""

""You still don't get it, do you? My marriage to Eliana is just for show. We'll get divorced soon enough. What's the big deal? It's none of your concern. You could just turn a blind eye! Are you trying to make yourself relevant?""

*Make myself relevant? So funny.*

Lowering her gaze, Yvonne spoke firmly, ""It doesn't matter if your marriage to Eliana is real or fake. I'm done with you. I want to end this.""

""Yvonne!""

""I'm exhausted,"" she said, closing her eyes. ""I've loved you for eight years, giving everything I had. I can't do this anymore. It's over.""

""Fine, you want to break up? Don't come crying back later!""

Zaid didn't bother going upstairs. He grabbed his coat and stormed out in anger.

For Yvonne, that was the end of it. She felt surprisingly lighter, as though a weight had been lifted.

She worked as a doctor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at Cloudstream Hospital. Arriving at the office early in the morning, she began receiving patients while overhearing gossip from the nurse, Molly Zinn.

""Do you know whose baby Eliana is carrying? They said it was a married actor's before. Seems like it could be Andrew's, but Zaid claimed it was his last night. Such drama. Honestly, if it were me, I'd pick Zaid. He's not just wealthy, but also incredibly handsome. I heard Zaid is very faithful. He's been in love with her for 15 years! Who wouldn't be impressed by his dedication?""

Yvonne wasn't interested in the gossip and promptly asked Molly to take a pregnant patient upstairs for an examination.

However, her brief moment of quiet didn't last long. Zaid called her again.

""Eliana will be coming to your hospital for a prenatal check-up tomorrow. Be ready to take care of her.""

**Chapter 2 He's Faithful, but I'm His Backup**

Yvonne's patience snapped. ""There are plenty of hospitals in Cloudville. Why did you have to come here? And why involve me?""

Despite her protest, Eliana still arrived early the next morning.

As soon as she stepped out of the car, she was swarmed by obsessive fans and paparazzi. With security arranged in advance and Zaid's protection, she managed to make it into the hospital.

Yvonne had already handed the case to another obstetrician, but Eliana insisted they were friends. That led Glen Baxter, the hospital director, to instruct Yvonne to take over.

The prenatal tests were completed quickly, and Yvonne reviewed the report. Everything appeared normal.

""The pregnancy is estimated to be ten weeks and three days. Since this is your first check-up, you'll need to prepare a pregnancy test manual,"" Yvonne said, glancing away from the computer to look at Zaid. ""The instructions are posted on the wall behind you. Just follow them.""

Zaid frowned, finding it bothersome. ""You handle it. I'll stay with Eliana.""

Yvonne's tone turned firm. ""I'm sorry, but this manual must be processed by the patient or their family. As a doctor, it's not my responsibility.""

""Yvonne, can't you see Eliana needs me right now? Couldn't you show some understanding?""

""If every family member expected me to be understanding, I'd end up running errands all day,"" she replied flatly.

Zaid frowned. ""You‚Äî""

""Next!""

He was about to argue, but Eliana intervened.

""Yvonne, please don't be upset. I won't burden him.""

Yvonne looked at Eliana. For 15 years, Eliana had maintained a close relationship with Zaid, just enough to feel his need, but never to the point of overstepping boundaries. Even though Zaid had once been Yvonne's boyfriend, Eliana had accepted his devotion while presenting herself as Yvonne's friend.

""He's your fianc√©,"" Yvonne said calmly. ""Isn't it normal to ask him for help? Why would I be upset?""

""Is it because of me that you two argued?"" Eliana asked.

""There was no argument. We've already broken up.""

""Yvonne, you're misunderstanding Zaid. He was only trying to help me.""

Raising her hand, Yvonne cut her off. ""You don't matter to me. You're not the reason we broke up. Don't think highly of yourself.""

""Yvonne, how dare you treat Eliana like that? Apologize to her!"" Zaid yelled.

Yvonne had tried to hold back, but she couldn't anymore.

""Get lost!"" she snapped.

Her harsh response led to a report being filed against her. Zaid made the complaint call right in front of her.

After they left, Yvonne was summoned to Glen's office.",1,1747470461.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

I gave him my cell number instead of the office. That was my first mistake. After few weeks he started texting me asking questions about his mom , sometimes he calls . These calls started to get longer and not during work hours. I was not worried and kept saying it‚Äôs harmless I am in control of this . 

One day he asked if we can meet for coffee to go over his mom not responding to treatment and becoming difficult to take care of. One meeting then two then three , then lunch , then dinner all this going on and I am telling my husband that I am at work . On night after an early dinner he was walking me to my car , he leaned forward and I thought he is going to give me a hug instead he kissed me I didn‚Äôt push him back .More dinners and drinks, kissing . I find myself kissing him in way I don‚Äôt think I ever kissed my husband sticking my tongue which I used to tell my husband it gross. 

That will bring me to my current situation, he asked if I would like to go to the beach on Memorial Day , he has a friend he is a cook at this upscale restaurant on the beach and he will cook something special for us . I agreed and told my husband I am going with friends to a pool party because he saw me buying swim suits. Very very revealing one not my type. He gave the name of the restaurant and the address . a couple of weeks before our dinner I decided to look up the restaurant to see what can order . I was shocked the restaurant is inside a five stars hotel. .i think he has another things planned. Because he mentioned let‚Äôs get there early and stay for dinner. I really like the guy and attention the kisses the conversation, I am afraid to go because I am not sure what will happens. Can you advise 

Update. ..if my husband finds out it will be over . He will tolerate this at all . I love my husband, but I love the attention I am getting . Only my best friend knows . She telling me I am pushing my luck and should end it . One of her reasons is he is too old for me . Seriously the guy is in a great shape and financially secure. 

Edit . No I have not slept with him, but there are heavy kisses , touching and holding . The scary thing some of these is initiated by me so unlike me ",1,1747469851.0,Marriage,60,0.56,False
