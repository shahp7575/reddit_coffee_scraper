I said I will make one myself but my wife had very specific requirements. So I ended up making it from plywood but there is no bottom board. Yet, it is still very rigid and strong. The top is made out of two pieces of plywood glued together and later wrapped with vinyl by my wife.  
  
Learned a lot from this project. It's really difficult to get long plywood boards flush with each other so I definitely need new and longer clamps. Overall really happy how it turned out.",2,1751487032.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False

I manage a small caf√© inside a library and so far we've been open for 1 year. I want to start moving away from commercial/wholesale items to stuff made in house, starting with the cold brew. I dont really drink cold brew so idk what taste I'm looking for but I need some help with diluting it for my customers. 

My cold brew recipe for a small batch is 12oz of medium roast coffee grounds to 36oz of water, steeped at room temp for 24hr then strained.

Is that a good ratio?? I need your advice. 

How would I then dilute it to serve to my customers? My drink sizes are 12oz and 16oz.

Side note, I have been taking sponge baths instead of showers- so the incisions have not gotten wet at all. Is that bad?? Would taking a shower help? I also went back to drinking 14 to 28 ounces of coffee per day (plus lots of water). Should I stop the coffee??

Want to get more out of Veo 3? It's not just about what you want to see, but how you direct the AI. Think of yourself as the director, cinematographer, and sound engineer, all through text!

**1. Your Prompt is a Mini-Screenplay**

Forget keywords. Veo 3 thrives on **detailed, descriptive narratives.**

* **Bad:** ""Man walks.""
* **Good:** ""A grizzled detective in a worn trench coat walks slowly down a dimly lit, rain-slicked city street at night, his eyes scanning every shadow. **Camera: low-angle tracking shot, following him closely.**""

**Key:** Describe *what*, *who*, *where*, *how they feel*, and *how the camera sees it*.

**2. Sequential Prompting for Dynamic Scenes**

Veo 3 can understand sequences within a single prompt, crucial for character shifts.

* **Example:** ""He bursts into wild laughter, head thrown back, body rocking. **Mid-laugh, he stops suddenly, eyes wide with terror, face frozen.**""

This creates a **fluid progression** of action/emotion.

**3. Consistency Through Detailed Character Description**

Maintaining characters is tough. Be hyper-specific:

* ""Eleanor, a woman in her late 20s with long, wavy red hair, piercing green eyes, and a small freckle on her left cheek, wearing a distinctive blue scarf.""

**4. Directing the Invisible: Audio & Atmosphere**

Leverage Veo 3's audio capabilities:

* **Dialogue:** `[Character A, cheerful: ""This coffee is amazing!""]` ‚Äì attribute and add tone!
* **Soundscapes:** ""Jazzy, melancholic piano music"" or ""ambient forest sounds with distant bird calls.""
* **Negative Prompts:** Add **""no subtitles""** or **""no background chatter""** to avoid unwanted audio.

**5. Intentional Camera & Style**

Be the director!

* **Camera:** ""Dolly shot moving forward,"" ""slow pan,"" ""tight close-up with slight handheld shake.""
* **Visual Style:** ""Cinematic film noir,"" ""vibrant anime style,"" ""gritty documentary feel.""
* **Technical Specs:** ""Upscale to 4K,"" ""60fps.""

Prompt Theory means **directing, not just describing.** It's about understanding how Veo 3 thinks and giving it the precise instructions to bring your vision to life.

Initially I didn't think much of him i just thought he's cool. But with time i feel like i got addicted to him and want to talk more and more.
However, i have tried texting him about some of the things we talked about as a way of saying i'm open to have a casual conversation outside of patient doctor relationship but he's been keeping me on delivered and responding daaays even a week later but bring it up next appointment and we'd talk more about it.
I've assumed that he's setting boundaries and politely rejecting.
But I can't stop thinking about him it's driving me crazy what do i do!!

I think it‚Äôs safe to say he never would‚Äôve had the opportunity to get flown out to Siargao and have a swimwear line if he wasn‚Äôt dating Ashley. She‚Äôs partnered with Blackbough for years, and he left that out and just acted like Blackbough reached out to him alone. 

I can‚Äôt find a good way to explain this, but I feel like Ashley always gives Kelly screen time in her content and lets him advertise DWE but Kelly doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as supportive towards Ashley in his content. I‚Äôve had the vibe that he is competing with her ever since he starting thinking about having a coffee business. It just seems like he‚Äôs trying to ride off of the success of Nami but with no particular passion for his own pursuits. It seems lazy tbh.

Slightly unrelated but it‚Äôs so obvious he doesn‚Äôt even know how to cook from that video as well.

Not whoever is in this subreddit. So if you are a part of a WFM team, don't mind it, it ain't about you, or maybe you are, idc.


So for a brief summary, i work in a company, completely WFH.
And as part of the rules that i signed and agreed, we are given a maximum of 10 minutes of Personal/Bio breaks per shift.
And that's mostly it.
Aside from the fact that you cannot take your bio break 10 minutes before or after your lunch/coffee breaks, before end of shift or after starting your shift, 
There's nothing else for me to comply on.


So I decided to only take
The Bio break every 7:30 am. 
This is 1 hour after my 2nd break (6:15am)
And 1 ¬Ω hour before my end of shift (9am)

So it is still within the rule.
And i did this for like a year 
My Bio break is always scheduled 
And it's always 10 minutes.


But somehow the Workforce caught wind of that and decided to report me and make an IR about it.
TL called me in for a meeting and all that.
They told me that the Bio break is habitual (they're right, tbh)
And wanted to make an IR about it.

But In my defense i completely followed what we agreed upon
So they cannot win this IR debate.
They gave me 10 minutes per day and i took that 10 minutes, everyday without it going beyond that.
And that should be the end of the discussion.


But of course, them power trippers hate it when they lose so they start saying things like

1.) Why do it everyday? Do you have a reason why?
(Whatever i do in that bio break does not concern them at all but they're going there.)


2.) The Avail time is High, why take a Bio Break?


This is very contradicting because if the avail time is low, we are also asked to Go all hands on deck and we're not allowed to go on bio for that too
Which i also comply on.


3.) Why is it always 7:30am?

Fair question but again,
 It is still allowed, so why be mad about it?



So yeah they keep throwing shi like that on the meeting 
Until i told them to just update the agreement and we'll sign it again.
But doing so would prove I'm right and i perfectly followed the previous contract without breaking any rules they set.



It's annoying and laughable at the same time really.
But what side are you guys on.

We continue to message online.. alot.. after a while the conversation becomes cute and a little flirty, lots of laughing, jokes, she watches all the film recommendations. We have so much in common and get along incredibly well.

After a few more days I ask her online if she is interested/attracted to me, she says yes, she says she can't help but look out for me at work, things like that. 

I ask her out for another coffee, she says she needs to think about it, she then says she can't work out if its a good idea and would feel guilty.

Conversation continues, I ask for clarity, I ask if she's not questioned the longevity of her current thing, if shes talking to me in the way we are. She says she told me from the start she was seeing someone, and nothing has happened between us. But she says she is struggling. I give her some space.

We then have a few bump into each other moments at work, awkward hello when passing. I ask for us to have a chat in person.

We don't find an opportunity so I message her saying we should this is really tough and we should stop chatting, it's causing upset and not fair on her because of her situation, I tell her that I really like her and my door is always open if her situation changes.

Today has been one of those long days. I just could not sleep for anything last night ‚Äî woke up at 4AM and my brain said, ‚ÄúHey buddy, we‚Äôre up now!‚Äù So I started the day running on fumes and about three sad scraps of REM sleep. Safe to say my mood has been firmly parked in the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù zone all day, but hey ‚Äî not every day is gonna be shiny.

Tiny Wins & Code Kudos

Even with my zombie shuffle, I did snag a few wins. One of the higher-ups checked out my code for my Chrome extension and liked it ‚Äî at least a little bit, which counts! He tossed me a few bigger ideas to chew on for the next few days, so tomorrow I‚Äôll try to gather all the info I need to turn my half-baked extension into something actually useful. Should be fun‚Ä¶ I hope. In my line of work, if you stop learning you get left behind faster than my sleep schedule, so I‚Äôm gonna keep grinding.

Coffee vs. Sleep: Round 14

My entire plan to stay awake today boiled down to three cups of coffee spread over twelve hours ‚Äî which sounds reasonable until you realize I was still nodding off during bridge training. Jaq, being the supportive queen she is, offered to make me more coffee, but at some point I feel like 10 cups just turns you into a twitchy raccoon. She‚Äôs pushing for me to try an OTC sleep aid tonight, which I don‚Äôt hate but also don‚Äôt love. Sleep juice always makes me feel like my sleep is wrong ‚Äî but a solid six hours would be pretty groovy at this point, so maybe I‚Äôll just knock myself out and see what happens.

The Great House Hunt: Now with Math

In my half-awake state, I decided to crank my house hunt up a notch by building a ‚Äúfinding house algorithm.‚Äù It‚Äôs basically my brain in math form:

If  
P ‚â§ $225K  
AND 5 ‚â§ A ‚â§ 20  
AND B ‚â• 1  
AND Ba ‚â• 1  
AND 600 ‚â§ S ‚â§ 1500  
AND Pow = yes  
AND Acc = yes  
AND Struct = yes  
AND (if RepType = major then T ‚â§ $130K, else T ‚â§ $225K)

Simple, right? Must have power, acreage in the sweet spot, at least one bedroom and bathroom, and so on. Then there‚Äôs the bonus factor ‚Äî the more trees, the better, and a water feature is like a +10 bonus score in my head. It‚Äôs my first time playing around with a free-form formula like this, but honestly, it just makes sense. Way better than guessing ‚Äî or scrolling listings until my eyeballs melt.


---

Final Thought

So yeah ‚Äî today‚Äôs vibe: no sleep, all code, gallons of coffee, and a healthy sprinkle of math magic to find the dream homestead. If the sleep juice works tonight, maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll wake up feeling like a functional human again. Fingers crossed.",1,1751486642.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

1lq5srp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrimarchGFs/comments/1lq5srp/lovers_unexpected_journey_meeting_a_totally/,Lover‚Äôs unexpected journey & meeting a (Totally) Sane-Person (Finished product),"Ever since Magna asked for Lover's help with a spell she had done and had accidentally sent him on a unexpected journey through space and time. Lover was currently running through a forest as he is being chased by a bunch of monsters. "" SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!"" He kept saying as one of the monsters tried to jump onto him, but missed as Lover went down the hill, his getting mud all over his clothes as the rain kept falling down. ""I SHOULDN'T HAVE WENT INTO THAI FORSET!"" He said, getting back up and leaps over a small crevice with the momentum he gained as he slide down the hill, barely making it across. The monsters behind him made it down and continued their pursuit. ""OH COME ON!"" He shouted, climbing up and continuing to run. He wipes the mud off his guardsmen visor, only to see another, and larger, crevice that he couldn't get over. Looking behind, he spots the monsters getting closer, making the man take a deep breath and decide to risk it. ""Empress be with me."" He mutters walking back a bit before sprinting forward. With all his strength, he jumped as far as he could, just in time as the monsters got near the ledge. 

Lover, unfortunately, didn't make it across, but was able to grab the edge of the other side of the crevice. The monsters on the side he had recently jumped off roared with anger, watching as their prey had escaped them. Lover slowly makes his way up, but struggles due to the rain weakening his grip. A rock comes loose making Lover yelp as he was about to fall. 

Only to be caught by a hand. ""Easy their kid."" Spoke a voice from on top the ledge. Lover looks up, spotting a person with a scar on his left eye, having short black hair and an ancient, yet advance, prosthetic left arm that he was using to keep Lover from falling to his death. ""Don't want you to fall now, right?"" He spoke. ""Come on, let's get you on solid ground."" He grunts, pulling Lover back up before falling on his rear end as Lover makes it back up with his help. ""Uh, thanks. Who are-"" Lover was interrupted by a roar from behind. ""Introductions later, for now, let's go somewhere that isn't trying to kill us."" The mysterious man said as he got back up. He then pulled out a 20th millennium rifle from his, making Lover confused of what was he doing with such an ancient weapon. The man got onto one of his knees, takings a deep breath and aims his rifle. The man fires several precise shots into each of the beast, dealing a good amount of damage but not killing them. That's when the man presses a button on the rifle, suddenly making the monsters burst up in flames. The rain wasn't even putting the fire out, making the beasts only roar in pain with some jumping into the large crevice to put themselves out of their misery. The man then removed the empty mag from the gun, throwing the mag into the crevice and loading a fresh mag in. ""Thermite bullets, glad I made it."" The man said, holstering the rifle on his back. Lover was surprised by the bullets being combustible and was going to ask, but saw that he was walking away, making him follow suit.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Lover and the stranger were now in a cabin, with the stranger checking and cleaning his rifle while Lover was sitting nearby. ""So, how long were those things chasing you?"" The stranger asked. ""For about 30 minutes."" Lover responded. ""Impressive, usually the average man would burn themselves out due to their fight or flight response. *looks at Lover* Guess this isn't your first time?"" The stranger asked. ""You can say I've had... an unexpected day."" Lover said, scratching his neck. ""Well, we all have one of those days. But I should probably introduce myself."" The stranger puts the rifle on the desk and faced himself towards Lover.

""My name is James, James Miller, war veteran and former general of the T.L.A."" The man known as James said. ""A former general? Now thats something. But I've never heard of this T.L.A."" Lover said. The man known as James lets out a sigh, grabbing a flask from his belt and taking a sip out of it. ""Don't blame you, since we ain't from the same place."" James explained. ""Should've figured since I've been to different places."" Lover adds, making James chuckle. ""Well, you can rest here until you finally get home. Just..."" Hames seemed to trail off before waving his hand. ""Never mind, just get some rest kid."" James then gets up from his chair and walks to his bed room. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Lover can be seen entering his room. It wasn't much, just a simple bed and a desk, but it was something than nothing. Lover took off his guardsmen uniform and went to bed.

(One good nap later)

Lover began to open his eyes, yawning for the good sleep he had gotten. Getting off the bed, Lover puts his uniform back on. ""Guess I should thank James for the help before I leave."" Lover thought out loud, strapping his helmet onto his head and walking out of the room. 

Only to find himself... somewhere else. 

Lover was taken back by the sudden change of scenery. The place was a large, heavily armored hallway. The air felt cold, and it was oddly silent, but the sound of distant gunfire could be heard. Lover turned around, only to find the door he walked out from was gone, replaced with the same hallway that stretched on, being lighted by the lights above. 

He picked a random direction and went that way, hoping to find a way out and get back to his home. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

As Lover continued to wonder around, he began to spot bullet casings and scorched marks on the walls and the floor, accompanied by dead bodies. Lover wasn't really surprised by this, due to his previous trips in other universes. He knelt down near one of the bodies, still clutching onto their rifle. Lover took the rifle from the body, having to rip it from their grasp to take it. Lover looked at the rifle, an automatic rifle with one full mag and the body having two spare mags on them. 

Breathing behind his visor, Lover walked forward, no armed with a weapon to defend himself. As he walked down the hallway, the sound of weapon fire got louder, with the sound of people shouted orders or being slaughtered by someone with a melee weapon. His heart beats abnormally, he is used to this, but something felt... off.

Just as he rounds the corner, he was met with...

Nothing.

There was nothing, no firefight, no blood, no bodies. Just, nothing. Lover was confused, but immediately snapped out of his stupidity, staying on high alert as he walked down the hallway. This is when he was greeted by a lone figure, standing ominously under a roof light. His bare chest was showing, covered in both fresh and dried blood, while his lower half being some simple raggedy pants being torn slightly. His eyes seemingly wore hatred and rage, his eyes colored crimson with the outer part being smoked black. 

What makes Lover concerned was that ork-like power claw he had for a left arm, which was dripping blood. ""You..."" It spoke with a near inhuman voice, sounding like a beast trying to speak. ""Ain't one of us..."" It said, confusing Lover, but he kept his guard up. ""What happened here?"" Lover asked, keeping his nerves steady. He's seen worse before, yet, this was putting him on edge. 

As if on queue, more lights flickered on, slowing a carnage that would make a Night Lord impressed or a War Hound impressed. ""Death..."" He said with a dry voice as he looks back at the carnage he had made. ""They deserved it. They were not innocent..."" He said, his voice cracking with rage, yet it was controlled, just barely. Lover swallowed a breath he didn't know he was holding and another question. ""Do you intend to fight?"" Lover asked, before hearing a dry laugh come out from the man. 

""That is based on your own choice..."" It said, grinning as it should his sharp teeth. ""I see no reason to kill you. But give me a reason... and you'll be given a painful death with this."" He said, flexing his claw arm as he raised it in the air. The man brought the claw back to his side as he then began to walk towards Lover, making him raised his gun and aimed it at him

""Don't shoot."" Spoke a voice out of nowhere, surprising Lover. The man got closer to Lover, making Lover out his finger on the trigger. Lover would've shot just as the man was approaching, yet, his gut told him to not fire. Lover had trusted his gut multiple times, so he decided to listen this time. Slowly lowering the gun, Lover stood there as the man continued to walk forward, before passing Lover and walking down a different hallway. 

""Wise choice..."" The man said with his voice echoing down the hallway. Soon multiple gunfire can be heard down the same hallway the man took, followed by screams, pleas, blood splatter and bones crushing. 

Not a second later, Lover sprinted down the hall, eager to leave this strange place. ""Yup, I want out, NOW!"" Lover said, putting as much distance between him and that thing for a human. Even though he didn't decide to kill Lover, Lover himself didn't want to give that man a reason too. Soon enough, Lover found another door, and without thinking enters it. 

But what Lover didn't not see on the door were the words: ""Soul Shards"".

Upon entering through the door, Lover slams the door shut and breaths a sigh of relief. ""Yes, another area, hopefully, I can find... a way... out?..."" Lover spoke as his voice becomes confused by the multiple large glass windows in the hallway. Lover approached one of them, seeing a panel with a description and a button underneath the window. The window itself showed nothing but a black void with Lover reflection being the only thing he sees.

Lover looks back down at the description, deciding to read it. 

""Description: 

Name: Jack (last name unavailable)

Age: 27
 
Occupation/Purpose: Last survivor of Winterhome, Steward of New London, embodiment of the Frostland and vessel of the flame.

Current location: Hell, Pride ring. Recently met and speaking to Azrael, Angel of death.

For more details, press the button for physical analysis.

Description end""

Lover was confused, yet curious, so he pressed the button.

Upon pushing the button, the window suddenly becomes a bright white wall of light before revealing a single man floating in the void, seemingly asleep. The man wore old winter clothes, with a strange device strapped to his chest, with boots and gloves on. Nothing special about his appearance. ""Strange."" Lover said, tapping the glass to see if the man would respond. Nothing, the man didn't respond to any sound.

Lover gave up trying to awaken the man and went to another window, looking at the description. 

""Description:

Name: Theodore (former name *Redacted*)

Age: 10 (soon to be 11)

Occupation/purpose: The marked vessel of light and dark. Hunted endlessly to be the host of light and dark. Doomed to be hunted forever.

Current location: At home drawing and showing his mother said drawings.

Soul Shard number: 2nd generation (technically)
Soul Shard strength: 5th (weakest due to being underdeveloped)

For more details, press the button for a physical analysis

Description end""

Lover, once again pressed the button, revealing a young boy in his pajamas floating in the void. ""Poor kid."" Lover said somberly. There was nothing he could do. 

Walking away slowly from the window, Lover looks at the next description, taking a deep breath, hoping of nothing sad

""Description:

Name: James

Age: 18 (soon to be 19)

Occupation/Purpose: Lover and boyfriend of many ladies. A kind, but Shy man. 

Current location: Being smothered and flirted by his girlfriends/wives.

Soul shard number: 3rd generation
Soul shard strength: 4th (due to lack of battle and strength)

For more details, press the button for a physical analysis""

Once again, Lover pressed the button, revealing a young man in casual clothing. ""He seems normal enough, but damn, he has lots of girls. He must be a charmer even if he's shy."" Lover said with a chuckle before moving onto the next. 

Lover did wonder what, ""Soul Shard"" meant. Could they perhaps be shards of a bigger being? How knows. Approaching the window Lover went and read the description once again.

""Description:

Name: James Miller

Age: 37 (biologically)
Cryogenically: over ten thousand years

Occupation/Purpose:War-veteran, war criminal, former general of T.L.A. (Short for The Legion of America), the bearer of the soul realm, forced to carry unspoken burdens, taunted and haunted by his past.

Current location: In the bunker resting after looking for materials.

Soul shard number: 1st generation (first creation)

Soul shard strength: 1st (reason: battle experience, abilities, an endless army of the soul realm and two split soul shards of his own to help when in battle)


For more details, press the button for a physical analysis""

Lover was shocked to discover that this description was about James, the one that helped him out. He pressed the button, revealing the familiar face of James and those recognizable scar and prosthetic arm. ""James? But... how?"" Lover was at a loss of words as he stared at James sleeping form. 

Walking away, Lover saw a door way for him to walk out from the room and into another, but there was one last window he has yet to look out from. He his mind told him to just leave, but yet his gut tells him to look through it and see what's next.

His curiosity won once again and he walks over to the window and this time, pressed the button without looking at the description. Lover's eyes widen in absolute shock as he looks at a person he's seen before. 

There, behind the glass.

Was The Grand Apothecary.

""Description:

Name: Ratchet (title: Grand Apothecary)

Age: 43
Cryogenically: unknown

Occupation/Purpose: Tends to the wounded SOs (Significant Others) injuries and as well as the matriarchs as well, but rarely. Became the Grand Apothecary due to his skill I'm medicine and being an ancient Terra-born/Earth-born.

Current location: In the infirmary getting drunk of MJORD and bread.

Soul shard number: 5th generation
Soul shard strength: 2nd

For more details, press the button for a physical analysis.""

Lover was confused and panicked, did someone created them!? Did someone created the Grand Apothecary, but for what reason? 

Lover, in a confused and shocked state, leaves the room before bumping into someone. 

In a blind panic, Lover aimed the gun and fired at the unknown person, and he kept firing until the gun clicked. 

""Over reacting as much?"" The person said. Lover looked at the rather large man and saw no wounds on him. The man seemed to be wearing rather regular clothes, and was holding a cup of coffee. ""Here, let's help ya up."" The man said calmly and with a bit of energy. With just a finger, he helped Lover back up on his feet and brushed some dust off Lover's shoulders. 

There was a brief silence for a moment, with only the tall man sipping from his coffee cup that said: ""Eldar fucker!"" on it. ""So, you're the guy that Maggy had accidentally transported all over the... multiverse, correct?"" The man said as he shortened his height to a normal length. ""Uhm, how do you-"" 

""Let me stop you there, you dont need to know how I know. What you want to know is how I can help."" The man said as he snapped his fingers, the room becoming a cozy wooden lodge with a fire place near, along with some chairs. ""Help with?..."" Lover dragged in. ""Well, helping you get back to your tall god-like wife that is about to beat the shit out of Maggy here in a bit."" The man said casually, taking another sip out of his coffee cup. ""Ah."" Was all Lover said, before taking a seat. 

""May I ask, where are we? And what those windows are?"" Lover asked, talking about the people in the windows. ""Hm? OH! You're talking about my OCs!"" The name said with enthusiasm, confusing Lover. ""Uhm, OCs?"" ""Oh, it's short of Original creations, somewhat. I don't deal in absolutes, I think..."" The man said as he scratched his chin. ""But we should do some introductions, the names Sane-Person, because I'm TOTALLY a sane person."" The man said before slowly starting to laugh hysterically before cutting himself off by clearing his throat, which weirded out Lover. 

""Ooookaaaayyy..."" Lover said as he grabbed a cookie from a nearby plate and takes a bite out of it from underneath his mask. ""But anyways, about the people you saw, they are my creations, I created them from my very soul, that along with a the books they exist in."" Sane-Person said as he teleported four books with different appearances. ""Well, some do."" Sane-Person whispered. ""But... why?"" Lover said, making Sane-Person chuckle. ""Why doesn't anyone do anything? Sheer! ABSOLUTE BOREDOM! That, and having too much imagination and spare time."" Sane-Person explained, with a his voice suddenly became a man on a radio station, before turning back to normal.

""Plus, I like to put the: 'I put my soul into these things' and mean it literally. I don't interfere with their lives, I'm simply their creator, but I just sit back and relax, let them live their lives. Sure, I make the story, but not everything is set in stone, there are... branches in the stories."" Sane-Person said before leaning towards Lover.

""I can see your branches too."" Sane-Person said as he pointed at Lover. From Sane-Person's point of view, we can see what he means. He LITERALLY sees branches sprouting from Lover's body, but being ghostly. Same-Person can see all the outcomes, all the possibilities that can be true or false. An ending that's perfect or one that tragic. ""I wish I could tell you your ending, but it would cease to be if I do. That and theirs other endings as well, some aren't pretty, while some are beautiful."" Same-Person said with a warm smile. 

""I just hope you get your happy ending."" He said as an image of Lover and the Empress in a loving embrace, with the words: ""United under one banner."" Above them. 

Sane-Person lets out a sigh, before standing up, finishing his cup of coffee. ""Just to let you know, Grand Apothecary knows of my existence, don't be shocked if he isn't surprised."" Sane-Person said to Lover. 

""But anyways! You should be heading home now. And trust me, this portal will take you home."" Same-Person said as he opened a portal. Lover gets up from the chair and walks towards the portal, before looking at Sane-Person on last time. ""Till we meet again."" Lover said politely. ""The chances are one in a billion."" Same-Person said as he watched Lover entered the portal.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Lover comes walking out of the portal, seeing the familiar place of the golden palace. ""Hey! I am bac-"" Lover was then Cut off by a Chancla being thrown at his head, which sent him back into the portal, leaving both a shocked Magna and Empress. ""Uhm...This time it wasn't me..."" Magna said to Empress. ""Shit!"" Empress shouted out loud and in a panic.

(Meanwhile with Lover)

Soldier can be seen fighting several blue merc robots as he tears a head off one while holding his rocket launcher. Lover comes falling down and into the snow head first. ""GET UP MAGGOT! I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU CAME FROM BUT RIGHT NOW YOU ARE ENLISTED IN MY TEAM!"" Soldier shouted as he blasted a robot with his rocket launcher. 


The end. :)

Same-Person: Hello! Sane-Person here! Surprised to see me? If not I know where you life! Just kidding, I don't know where you are, or do I?...

But anyways, hope you enjoyed reading this short(?)-story, about someone's comic that I had found interesting on this community. Anayways, I gotta go, Slaanesh is is trying to barge into my room.

1lq5sht,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lq5sht/my_boss_got_a_call_from_a_wellknown_radio_station/,"My boss got a call from a well-known radio station about going on a second date with someone, but he confessed to me that he liked me.","Hi, I'm new to Reddit, and I've actually noticed that people often post their stories and experiences here, and people comment, so I hope people respond to this post and see what other people think about my case, This case happened to me a while ago but I would like you to comment on it.

My name is Christian, I'm in my twenties. I have a stable job, and I'm doing very well in life, thank God. A few weeks ago, my boss at work started flirting with me (I'll call him Elias to keep his real name a secret).

Elias is like what a woman would look for, he is handsome, charismatic, he has money, etc. And I was very surprised that he was flirting with me, at first I didn't look at him like that, I looked at him as just a boss being kind, bringing coffee to my desk, taking me casual talks, inviting me to lunch or dinner when we left work, touches casual, etc. That continued for a while until I talked to a friend and she told me that I was an idiot for thinking that he treated me like that out of friendship and stuff because Elias didn't do anything like that with other employees of him, who even she looked at he looked at me and touched casually when we ran into each other and many more things.

Well, to make a long story short, here's the ""problem""‚Ä¶ it turns out he was about to close a deal with a man, and so far, everything was fine. But that businessman suggested to Elias that he go out with his daughter to close the deal. Clearly, Elias did. He went out with the girl, and they had a beautiful, romantic date. (At the time, I didn't know anything and thought Elias was just closing a normal deal.)

After two weeks I think, I was with Elias and we were in his office and we were talking in our free time, until he got a call, that call was from a radio station, Elias answered with his normal tone when he answers important calls, well that call itself from what I understood, is that this program has a section where they call people and ask if they want to go for a second date with the person who contacted them (I don't know if I explained myself well, sorry)

There I found out that Elias had dated the daughter of a businessman and that he had lied to her that he loved her and that she was beautiful and many other things. After finishing the call, he looked at me and apologized for listening in on the call. There he literally confessed and told me that he liked me and that he did it for work, but that he loved me.

I was in shock, first because of the confession and second because of the call. Even though the call was in a normal tone, I could hear two women screaming. One person laughed in the background, and it was complete chaos. I actually thought it was funny, not so much because of the businessman's daughter, who actually thought Elias liked her.

Elias looked at me and apologized, and I was like, ""But we're not a thing!"" He told me that if I agreed to go on a date with him and if, over time, I let this flow between us, he would make me happy for the rest of my life.

And I don't think I made it clear, but I'm bisexual and I was starting to have feelings for Elias, but listening to him and seeing him, I'm not lying, he seemed like a scolded puppy waiting to be cuddled. He was sweet in my opinion, but recording the call, I didn't know what to think. I told him I would think about it because I had things to do, but that I would give him my answer.

And now I don't know what to do anymore. Hahahaha. All of this seems funny to me, but I still feel bad for the woman who called that radio station to talk to Elias and that Elias told her it was only 'to close a deal with his father.'

I know it's silly to ask strangers, but what do you think I should do? Hahaha, I'd like to read at least some of your opinions.",0,1751486549.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

It‚Äôs been awhile. I just did a quick recap on my last test to see what I did and how I liked it (I forgot what I did and use). I guess it was good! Anyway the inspiration for this test was because for some people canned pumpkin isn‚Äôt easily accessible to them. That made me sad üòî. Everyone should be able to have some low cal high protein brownies that you can eat the whole 8x8 (He said the title!). The secret ingredient for today‚Äôs test‚Ä¶ unsweetened applesauce! TBH I had low expectations for this. Mostly because I added 3g of baking soda (hand slipped) so I was afraid it was going to become more cake than brownie. I ran out of cocoa powder so felt you would taste the applesauce. The end results shocked me! Kinda light when I picked up a slice but didn‚Äôt come out like a cake (texture or appearance wise). Nice size. Surprisingly fudgey. Almost looked like a‚Ä¶ brownie?!?!?! I really enjoy this more than I should. I love the subtle sweetness you get from the applesauce. Like I mentioned 4 sentences ago, fudgey. Honestly if I had more cocoa powder, this would be the closes  (I say at least 90%) I got to a brownie like flavor and texture. I think I liked this more than the pumpkin one. Macros are not bad. Wish it had a little more protein üò§üí™. Maybe add cottage cheese next time?

My Honest First Impressions,"Track Your GLP-1 Journey With The [GLP-1 LOG IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glp-1-log-injections-tracker/id6747810242?platform=iphone)


You know that feeling, right? The one where a new headline pops up, promising something genuinely groundbreaking in an area you care deeply about. Maybe you've been on your own health journey, or perhaps you're just fascinated by the rapid pace of medical innovation. Whatever your reason, if you're like me, ""Retatrutide"" has probably crossed your radar recently, and your mind's started buzzing with questions.

It's easy to get swept up in the initial excitement, but I've found it's super important to pause and really think through what these new developments mean. This isn't a deep dive into the science-y bits - we can save that for another day! Instead, I want to share my honest, unfiltered first impressions and the questions that immediately came to mind when I started hearing more about Retatrutide. Consider this our chat over coffee, where we talk about what's really on our minds.

**The ""Wow"" Factor: What First Caught My Eye**

Let's be real, the initial reports about Retatrutide's potential are pretty eye-popping. When you hear about something that could offer significant benefits, especially in weight management, it naturally grabs your attention. My first reaction was definitely a mix of curiosity and a healthy dose of ""could this really be true?""

Here's what immediately stood out to me:

* **The Numbers:** Honestly, the reported efficacy rates are what first made me sit up straight. We're talking about potential weight loss percentages that are, quite frankly, remarkable when compared to previous options.
* **Novel Mechanism:** It's not just another tweak to an existing approach. Retatrutide works on multiple fronts, targeting different hormonal pathways. This multi-pronged attack felt like a really smart strategy.
* **The Buzz:** You start hearing about it everywhere - in medical journals, news articles, and even casual conversations. That kind of widespread interest usually signals something significant is on the horizon.

It's exciting to imagine the possibilities, especially for folks who've struggled with weight management for years. This is actually pretty cool, isn't it?

**Beyond the Hype: My Immediate Questions and Concerns**

After the initial ""wow,"" my brain quickly shifted into a more analytical mode. As someone who believes in looking at the full picture, I immediately started asking questions that go beyond just the headline figures.

**Safety First, Always**

My biggest immediate concern, like many, was safety. Any powerful new medication comes with potential side effects, and it's crucial to understand them.

* **What are the common side effects?** Are they manageable, or do they significantly impact daily life?
* **Are there any serious, less common risks?** This is something I'd want to know right away.
* **How does it interact with other medications?** So many of us are on daily meds, and compatibility is key.

You might be wondering the same things, and it's totally normal to prioritize your well-being above all else.

**Long-Term Considerations**

It's one thing for a medication to work well in the short term, but what about the long haul? This is a big one for me.

* **Is this a lifelong treatment?** If so, what does that commitment look like?
* **What happens if someone stops taking it?** Do the benefits reverse quickly?
* **Are there any long-term health implications that we don't know about yet?** This is often the case with newer treatments, and it's a valid thing to consider.

**Accessibility and Practicality**

Then there's the practical side of things. Because let's face it, even the most effective medication isn't helpful if it's not accessible.

* **How will this be administered?** Is it an injection, a pill, something else?
* **What's the anticipated cost?** This is a huge factor for many people, myself included.
* **Will it be widely available?** Or will it be restricted to certain conditions or specialists?

These are all important questions that start to paint a more realistic picture of what incorporating something like Retatrutide into one's life might actually entail.

**It's Not Just About the Numbers: The Bigger Picture**

Here's where it gets interesting. While the weight loss numbers are compelling, I quickly realized that thinking about Retatrutide isn't *just* about the scale. It's about a much broader approach to health.

**Lifestyle Matters, Still**

Even with a powerful new tool, our daily habits remain crucial. We've all been there, hoping for a magic bullet, but real, sustainable change often involves more.

* **Dietary Choices:** Will people still need to focus on nutritious eating? (My gut says yes, absolutely!)
* **Physical Activity:** How important will exercise remain alongside this treatment?
* **Mental Well-being:** Weight management isn't just physical; it's deeply tied to our mental health. Will this support overall well-being, or just the physical aspect?

**The Role of Support**

No one's health journey happens in a vacuum. Thinking about Retatrutide made me think about the support system needed around it.

* **Medical Guidance:** It's clear that this isn't something you'd just pick up. Professional medical oversight will be essential.
* **Behavioral Support:** Will patients need coaching or therapy to address underlying habits?
* **Community:** The power of sharing experiences and encouragement can't be overstated.

What's fascinating is how these new medications make us think about health holistically. It's never just one thing, is it?

**Is It Right for *You*? My Current Takeaway**

So, after all these initial impressions and questions, what's my current takeaway? It's pretty straightforward, actually.

Retatrutide represents a truly exciting frontier in weight management and metabolic health. The potential benefits are significant, and it's certainly worth continued attention and research. However, my first impressions strongly reinforce the idea that this, like any powerful medical intervention, is a serious consideration.

Here's what I've learned from my initial thoughts:

1. **Don't Rush In:** It's tempting to jump on the next big thing, but patience and thorough research are your best friends.
2. **Talk to Your Doctor:** This is non-negotiable. Only a healthcare professional can assess if a treatment like Retatrutide is appropriate for your specific health profile and needs.
3. **Consider the Whole Picture:** Think beyond just weight loss. What are the lifestyle changes, the long-term commitment, and the potential impact on your overall well-being?
4. **Manage Expectations:** While promising, no treatment is a miracle cure. It's a tool, and like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used and the context it's used within.

The journey towards better health is a personal one, filled with choices and considerations. Retatrutide is certainly a fascinating new option to think about, but it's just one piece of a much larger, more intricate puzzle. Keep asking questions, keep learning, and always, always prioritize what feels right and safe for *you*.",1,1751486468.0,RetatrutideWiki,0,1.0,False

¬†

We noticed we‚Äôre not the only ones struggling to expand our circle of friends - whether it‚Äôs because we just moved to Montreal, we‚Äôre going through a new phase in life, or we‚Äôre simply tired of endlessly scrolling Facebook and Instagram trying to find something that actually makes sense.  
Too much noise, not enough real connection. And it‚Äôs hard to know who you‚Äôll end up with.

So we decided to create an app designed to make it easier to build friendships through activities that feel like *us* (hikes, coffee meetups, game nights, outings, etc.).

And YES, we get it - some people are totally anti-app, and we totally respect that. But for many, starting with an app is actually a simple and convenient way to connect socially.

No dating, no ambiguity. Just an easy way to meet people - whether you‚Äôre solo, in a couple, or with friends.

Sounds like something you‚Äôd be into? We‚Äôve launched a waitlist where you can get 6 months of free premium features and be one of our favorite beta testers ‚ù§Ô∏è

He had mostly been great, taken me out for nice dinners, even a little staycation. He‚Äôs polite, intelligent and fun. 

Now, I am looking for a very specific type of guy. I‚Äôve been a business woman since I was 19, and I want a man who‚Äôs preferably more successful. Maybe an unpopular opinion, but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always wanted. I‚Äôve also gone through a major glow up in the last year and I date to marry someone who really puts an effort in themselves. I want my partner to not only be bf material but husband material. When I first met this guy, I thought he was all that. Well dressed, nice clean house that he owned, very caring and would definitely be a good father. 

I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did for work at first aside from the fact that he was a business owner. He would occasionally fly to ‚Äúsee clients‚Äù. He would have dinner and coffee with clients. He made his consultation calls sound super important. So what do you think a person like this does? Well you would probably think tech, finance, investing. He even said he had meetings with investors.

Today, we had a brunch date and we talked about work. Well turns out that his company publishes children‚Äôs books. Like textbooks for little kids. 

By no means is that a bad job. Heck, I‚Äôve worked with people in that field before in a uni internship, but come on. He‚Äôs almost 40 years old, and it‚Äôs just a turn off. I ended it, because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to me (or him) to have something he does be such a turn off for me. It wouldn‚Äôt last anyhow.

My friends mostly think I‚Äôm an asshole, because that‚Äôs apparently an interesting career for them. I guess. Cool. But not for me. I dread going to events or something with him, and introducing ‚Äúmy husband who makes kids books‚Äù. Or being asked what my bf does for work. Plus with the growth of AI publishing will disappear anyway and he might go broke.

1lq5hzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1lq5hzh/spinning_my_wheels_or_am_i_on_the_right_track/,Spinning my wheels or am I on the right track?,"Hi, all! Oof. Could I please get your advice, insults and/or praise? Would settle for just the first. Traveling to Japan for 2 weeks in early October (5-18th). Recently booked flights and feeling the pressure to finalize the hotels and such. We‚Äôve made lists of the main sites we‚Äôd like to see and the areas we wouldn‚Äôt mind staying. Some activities require reservations to be made ‚Äúlong‚Äù after we‚Äôve booked the hotels, so we are being very flexible about WHAT we are doing and focusing on WHERE we‚Äôll do it. Flexible on hotel costs for the ‚Äúmost‚Äù part. Not looking for exact recommendations there, but feel free to share opinions. 

Don‚Äôt tap out yet, but‚Ä¶we went with the crazy idea to check into a Disney resort Day 1 (early arrival to Haneda) and then spend Days 2 & 3 in the parks (TDL and then TDS). This is booked. Since we want to get the most out of DisneySea on Day 3, we decided to make the next leg of our trip an area within Tokyo. That‚Äôs where my planning falls apart. We want to do something like the following, but keep getting hung up on days and areas, especially surrounding Fuji‚Ä¶

TOKYO:
Day 1: Arrival at Haneda at 4:20am on Oct 5th. We plan to get a decent amount of sleep on the flight. Can make our way leisurely through airport and eventually onward to Disney area. Can always drop ‚Äúluggage‚Äù off and just chill at hotel or in Ikspiari. Basically‚Ä¶take it easy after a long flight. Hotel: Fantasy Springs Resort. Night 1/2 at Disney resort. 

Day 2: Tokyo Disneyland day; Hotel: night 2/2 at Fantasy Springs Resort

Day 3: Tokyo DisneySea day; Hotel: Thinking Asakusa but open to opinions. Husband is looking at The Gate Hotel. Night 1/3 in Asakusa. 

Day 4: Visit Asakusa and perhaps Akihabara; night 2/3 in hotel in Asakusa

Day 5: Visit Ueno (parks, museum, etc); night 3/3 in Asakusa

TO KYOTO:
Day 6: check out of Asakusa hotel; visit Akihabara if we didn‚Äôt already, then after lunch catch a Shinkansen to Kyoto. Hotel: night 1/4 in Kyoto. Was looking at Marufukuro, but prices have been rising as availability decreases.  

Day 7: Visit & stay in Kyoto; shrines, etc. Hotel: night 2/4 in Kyoto. 

Day 8: Day trip to Osaka; Hotel: night 3/4 in Kyoto

Day 9: Day trip to Nara; Hotel: night 4/4 in Kyoto

TO ‚ÄúFuji Area‚Äù: HELP?
Day 10: check out of Kyoto and take train to ‚Äúan area around Fuji‚Äù Hotel/city?: Night 1/2 in area. Ryokan? Help!

Day 11: more time in area around Fuji. Maybe just relax in ryokan? See local area. Help! Hotel: Night 2/2 in area. 

TO TOKYO: 
Day 12: check out of ‚ÄúFuji area,‚Äù trains (Help?!) to Shibuya. Spend rest of day checking out local area. Hotel in Shibuya. Looking at Shibuya Excel Hotel Tokyu. Right in the middle of it all. 1/2 nights in Shibuya. 

Day 13: See Shibuya and Shinjuku. This is our last night and happens to be a Friday night. Want to see the liveliness of the area. 2/2 night in Shibuya. 

Day 14: check out of hotel; Have a ‚Äúleisurely‚Äù morning in Shibuya. Flight out of Haneda at 4:30pm. 

Do these split make sense? 

About us: Two 43 yr olds. Husband/wife. We‚Äôre traveling light to start. No big luggage. 2 people. A backpack each. One small roller.  Okay with doing laundry. May pick up a piece of luggage to check on the way home on the last leg of the trip with gifts for family/friends. We aren‚Äôt the skinniest, but not obese. We train for and run marathons and hike multi-day trips with elevation. Okay with being on and using our feet. I know very (very) basic Japanese. Maybe N5 at this point and studying on my own. We like a little bit of everything: culture, history, tech, coffee, anime, video games, nature, etc. Generic? Maybe. 

We want to spend the ‚Äúfull‚Äù day at Tokyo DisneySea (since it‚Äôs unlike the parks at home), so staying in Tokyo as ‚Äúleg 2‚Äù afterward made the most sense to us. But we also want to be back in Tokyo before the flight home. 

We don‚Äôt want to have to shuffle hotels too often, so wanted to use Kyoto as a home base for Osaka and Nara. 

My husband originally had no interest in a Fuji stop, but now wants to make it happen. I know the trails will be closed and Fuji may or very well may not get a dusting of snow. We weren‚Äôt looking to climb on this trip or have the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù photos. Just ‚Äúget closer.‚Äù So we thought we‚Äôd make this the Ryokan part of the trip. Relax. A little lost on where to stay and how to travel between Kyoto, this nebulous undefined area, and Tokyo with this stop. Kawaguchiko? Fujinomiya? Further away to Hakone? Cut it out all together? Day tripping to Fuji from Tokyo sounded a bit exhausting, but I‚Äôm welcome to opinions.

So there you have it. We‚Äôre mostly flexible within these dates, but do want to spend time in Tokyo and Kyoto (and the surrounding area). Any help is greatly appreciated. Plan to book hotels in the next couple of days. THANK YOU! ",1,1751485838.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.67,False

1lq5hjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/1lq5hjr/i_was_banned_for_leaving_a_negative_review/,I was banned for leaving a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù review.,"I just saw a similar story in this sub, so I know I‚Äôm not the only one.

There‚Äôs a small coffee and tea shop that just opened about a year in my city, but it‚Äôs laid out more like a bar. There‚Äôs an actual bar area with barstools where you can sit and sip your coffee/tea and eat light snacks like charcuterie. There were also tables throughout the venue with chess boards. I vaguely knew the owner when he opened it. As in I knew who he was. He‚Äôs a friend of a friend. So when the place opened, I loved it. Very unique idea. The atmosphere was great, and the two employees at the time were really friendly and helpful, as was the owner.

Surprisingly, the place exploded. It didn‚Äôt take long for it to get popular. It was in a great area, and it was obviously being marketed well. But with that‚Ä¶came an EXTREMELY inflated ego. He still *appeared* friendly and greeted everyone at the door with a smile. But also, he started ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù with the shop. Changing the hours, changing some of the events (like karaoke, trivia night, etc.), and of course, increasing prices.

All this time, I was leaving reviews on Yelp because that‚Äôs what I like to do. I‚Äôm a local, and I like helping both other locals and tourists find neat places around town that aren‚Äôt tourist traps. So my first review was great. Then when they started changing things up, I politely critiqued them. I mentioned that the prices were becoming a bit unreasonable. I mentioned that the new hours didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. All in hopes that he‚Äôd take the criticism constructively and listen to the customer.

Boy, was I wrong! He took it VERY personally. Instead of listening and apologizing, he was very defensive. I kept going because I still liked the place‚Ä¶just not as often because I couldn‚Äôt afford to go every week anymore due to the rising prices.

Then the crazy thing was when he changed happy hour. Instead of BOGO free, he changed it to BOGO half off. So essentially 25% off instead of half off. And instead of in the afternoon, happy hour was EARLY in the morning. Like you had to get there as soon as they opened to get this deal. So again, I updated my review, trying to be as polite as possible while still giving constructive criticism from a consumer perspective. He responded very defensively again. ‚ÄúThis clearly isn‚Äôt the place for you!‚Äù he said.

Well, I guess not. He just lost a loyal customer. But then yesterday I decided to drop in and see if anything had changed. Did he have as many customers? Had the schedule changed? Well, I went in, and everything looked the same. I went up to the bar, ordered a drink, and then one of the barista/bartenders came up and said, ‚ÄúOh hey, the owner said you aren‚Äôt allowed here anymore.‚Äù

Yeah, so apparently I‚Äôm fucking BANNED from this place just because he doesn‚Äôt like me and has an ego like an overinflated balloon. It looks big, but if you even touch it with your finger, it bursts and turns into air.

I hope he keeps banning more customers until he doesn‚Äôt have anymore customers. 

It‚Äôs really a shame because I really loved the business itself. I told some other customers about my experience, and they didn‚Äôt seem to care. They were just like ‚Äúsorry dude‚Äù and shrugged. But if they dare say anything negative about the owner, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get banned too.

Oh, and as kind of a side note, another thing that kind of pisses me off is how avoidant he is. I saw him in public recently. This was before I‚Äôd been banned, maybe a month ago. I saw him standing in line; he was right in front of me. He turned around and saw me, and I was going to say hi, but he just dashed away into another room before I could say anything. And when I was banned yesterday, instead of HIM coming directly up to me and saying I can‚Äôt come back, which he could have easily done, he had someone else come up and tell me on his behalf.

Grow a fucking spine. If you have a problem with me, say it to my face.

1lq5gfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lq5gfd/delve_into_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker_hario/,Delve Into the Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker Hario Mizudashi Worth It,"I‚Äôve been using the Hario MCPN-14B Cold Brew Coffee Maker daily for a few weeks now, and it has honestly transformed how I make my morning coffee. As someone who‚Äôs obsessed with cold brew and tired of spending money at coffee shops, I was eager to see if this sleek glass brewer would live up to its reputation. Spoiler: it mostly does, although there are a few quirks worth noting.  

**Build Quality and Design**  
The black design paired with the heatproof glass construction is both elegant and sturdy, making it an eye-catching addition to my kitchen counter. It feels premium without being overcomplicated. The compact dimensions (3.7"" x 5.43"" x 11.57"") mean it doesn‚Äôt hog space and easily fits into my fridge door. Cleaning the reusable filter and the glass body is effortless, which I really appreciate as someone who doesn‚Äôt like fiddly cleanup jobs. Minor gripe? The glass can feel a bit fragile, so you‚Äôll need to handle it with care, especially during washing.  

**Simplicity in Usage**  
What struck me first was just how easy it is to use. You toss about 80 grams of coffee into the fine mesh filter, pour water over the grounds, stir, and pop the whole thing into the fridge. Leave it overnight (it needs 8 hours for optimal steeping) and voil√†‚Äîsmooth, richly flavored cold brew ready to go in the morning. The removable filter makes cleanup as painless as brewing. Compared to some pod or drip-based cold brew systems, this minimalistic process truly stands out and emphasizes the ""manual"" cold brew experience.  

**Highlights**  
- Sleek, modern design that elevates any kitchen.  
- Simple to use and clean; perfect for both beginners and cold brew aficionados.  
- Eco-friendly with its reusable filter, eliminating the need for paper ones.  
- Compact design fits easily in tight fridge spaces.  

[Grab Hario MCPN-14B at the best price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b001vpxebu/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Here‚Äôs the good news: the Hario cold brew coffee maker delivers on its promise of full-bodied, less acidic, smooth cold brew. Adjusting your grind size allows you to tweak the strength and profile of your coffee. Coarser grinds yield a lighter, tea-like coffee, while fine grinds create a robust and stronger brew. This versatility caters to a range of personal preferences. I‚Äôve experimented with various coffee blends (from fruity Ethiopian beans to dark French roasts), and each batch has been consistently satisfying.  

**Flaws**  
- The glass feels almost too delicate for clumsy folks.  
- Steep time requires patience; no quick brews here.  
- The filter mesh can be tricky to clean if grounds get stuck in tight spaces.  

**Reusable Filter Functionality**  
I can‚Äôt talk about this product without praising the reusable filter. This fine mesh basket is surprisingly efficient at keeping even fine coffee particles out of your brew. There‚Äôs no need for disposable paper filters, making it environmentally friendly and economical in the long run. Plus, the mesh doesn‚Äôt add any off flavors, which is a common complaint with lower-quality reusable filters.

**Other Options**  
There are plenty of competitors out there, and it‚Äôs worth considering your needs before committing. Products like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker or the OXO Brew Compact Coffee Maker also cater to cold brew enthusiasts. The Takeya model, for instance, comes in a plastic design that‚Äôs virtually indestructible, but it doesn‚Äôt have the sophisticated look or feel of this one. Meanwhile, the OXO Brew offers more advanced features like measuring indicators but comes at a higher price point. If you appreciate simplicity and charm, Hario genuinely holds its ground against these rivals while achieving immaculate results.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its glass and metal construction, this coffee maker feels like good value for its price range. You‚Äôll undoubtedly find cheaper plastic versions, but they lack the durability and elegant aesthetic that the Hario offers. If cold brew is a regular part of your routine, the cost feels justified for the quality of coffee you‚Äôre getting. It‚Äôs definitely more of a long-term purchase for those who are serious about brewing their own coffee at home.

1lq5gdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/comments/1lq5gdq/new_review_for_the_smiling_dog_cafe_from/,New review for The Smiling Dog Cafe from Goodreads by Elizabeth C.,"The Smiling Dog Caf√© By Neil S. Plakcy is not just a book it‚Äôs a balm. Rarely have I read something that feels so deeply kind. From the first scene to the last, there‚Äôs an atmosphere of gentleness that makes the reader feel held, even while walking with characters through grief, fear, and pain.

The structure of two novellas was a clever choice, allowing two distinct emotional arcs while maintaining a shared, magical space. Jeff‚Äôs story in ""Code of Silence"" felt deeply personal, and I was moved by the metaphor of lost voice how trauma can silence us, and how finding safe spaces can slowly bring that voice back. ""A Mother‚Äôs Heart"" had me in tears more than once, especially when Sophia begins to understand that love can be passed down just as powerfully as fear.

And the dogs! I can‚Äôt write this review without talking about them. The golden retriever and Irish setter are more than just cute companions they‚Äôre spiritual touchstones, representing intuition, loyalty, and emotional guidance in a world that often feels directionless. Betty, the caf√© owner, is the grounding force who makes it all feel possible, with her blends of coffee that taste like memory and her quiet, unwavering support.

This is the kind of book I‚Äôll recommend again and again. For anyone going through a hard time, for anyone who needs hope, or for anyone who just loves a bit of cozy magic The Smiling Dog Caf√© is a must-read.

Do we get the WiFi? I gotta do my dailies, but if the bandwidth is crap, I'll have my sister do them for me.

The wife and I are NOT heavy drinkers. Is a drink package worth it if all the wife is gonna drink is water and maybe iced tea with a glass of wine for dinner and a morning coffee? Should I get the non-alcoholic package for the kiddo?

We have been told we are not allowed to work any less than what we are contracted, which is fine because I would like maybe 3 shifts a week in comparison to my usual 4/5. My reasoning is simply that it is really burning me out, which may sound stupid I know, but it is taking a mental toll on me for an array of reasons that I won‚Äôt delve into.

Hey r/VeoPrompts! Just dove deep into Veo 3 and wanted to share some key tips for getting the best results from your prompts. It's all about being clear and iterative!

**1. Be Specific with Action & Details**

Don't just say ""A person walks."" Try ""A young woman with a red scarf walks briskly down a bustling city street, smiling as she glances at shop windows."" **Detail is king!**

**2. Iterate, Iterate, Iterate!**

Don't stick to one prompt. **Tweak your wording, add or remove elements, and try new phrasing** each time. Small changes can lead to huge differences.

**3. Consistency is Key for Characters**

For recurring characters, provide **detailed descriptions** of their look and even mannerisms. ""A grizzled detective with a neatly trimmed beard and a worn trench coat"" works better than ""a detective.""

**Audio & Dialogue Pro-Tips**

* **Dialogue Control:**
   * **Write your own:** `[Character A, cheerful: 'This coffee is amazing!']`
   * **Let Veo 3 script:** ""Two friends discussing their favorite books.""
   * **Pronunciation:** For tricky names, try phonetic spelling.
   * **Who says what:** Clearly label speakers: `[Narrator's voiceover...]`
* **No Subtitles?** Add **""No subtitles""** to your prompt if you don't want them.
* **Background Audio:** Be specific! Want quiet? Say ""no background noise."" Want rain? Ask for ""sound of gentle rain."" Avoid those unwanted studio audiences!

**Visual Polish & Technical Specs**

* **Music:** Don't just say ""upbeat."" Try ""Jazzy, improvisational piano music, sophisticated and lively.""
* **Styles:** Experiment with ""anime style,"" ""film noir aesthetic,"" ""1980s neon vibe.""
* **Camera Motion:** Direct the camera! ""Dolly shot moving backwards,"" ""Overhead drone shot,"" ""Quick zoom-in.""
* **Selfie-Style:** Use ""Selfie perspective"" or ""Vlog-style footage.""
* **Vertical Video:** Crucial for Shorts/Reels: Add **""Vertical video""** or **""9:16 aspect ratio.""**
* **Physics Check:** If things look wonky, refine your prompt with more realistic actions.
* **Upscale:** Want better quality? Add **""Upscale to 4K resolution""** or **""Render at 60 frames per second.""**

Prompting Veo 3 is an art. Keep experimenting, learn from each output, and refine your approach. You'll be amazed at what you can create!

Hoping.,"Well here goes nothing! Hey, my name is Nathaniel, and I‚Äôm a 26-year-old Christian walking a journey of healing and redemption. To start off, I‚Äôd like to share a bit about my faith and the bumpy road I‚Äôve walked in my journey walking with Christ. I would describe myself as a born again follower of Jesus. While I have been walking with Him my whole life, and I grew up going to church, I didn‚Äôt really know Jesus or his nature until about 4 years ago when I decided on a very tearful night driving home that I needed Jesus more than I knew, and I gave my life to him that night. Even though I gave my life to Him doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt had my bumps in the road. I‚Äôm a very honest guy, and I believe telling the truth and being upfront early is always the right move. With that said my journey with Christ has been riddled with temptation, heartbreak, lust, and loneliness. All of these are a part of my story, but so has the grace of God. I believe with all my heart that God can use even our brokenness to bring something beautiful. Even though I struggled with lust and temptations, I realized that I don‚Äôt have to let that define me, and that I have been redeemed by the grace of God. That said, by Gods grace, I have managed to remain celibate my entire life. I‚Äôve made mistakes, I‚Äôve battled through seasons of isolation, and I‚Äôve had my heart crushed more than once. But I‚Äôm still standing. Still growing. Still becoming the man I believe God wants me to be. That man he wants me to be is one who leads in love, serves with strength, and lives with intention. Now that I have all that off my chest, and you know a bit about my faith journey, I want to touch on the other aspects of myself you have yet to know. To start, I went to college for two years and earned a degree in Gunsmithing and Weapons Design & Technology. I was blessed to be one of the few Gunsmiths to be hired in to work as a Master Gunsmith straight out of school for a family owned firearms company. I‚Äôm incredibly passionate about my job, and one of the few guys you‚Äôll meet who loves his job, and feels like he never works a day in his life. As for my personal life outside of work, I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm a big-time sci-fi nerd, a gamer, and a lifelong LEGO builder. I love the outdoors, especially when it involves good weather, good coffee, and fresh air. I work on classic cars, shoot guns at the range, and can talk about history, Star Wars, Star Trek, Westerns, or Transformers for way too long if you let me. As for what I am looking for on here? I‚Äôm looking specifically for a Godly woman who is emotionally mature, spiritually grounded, and ready to pursue something lasting and real. I‚Äôm looking for someone who values truth, faith, and grace. I believe that when you wed someone that you and that person are in a covenant with one another and God, it‚Äôs not just chemistry. I need someone who will see my flaws, but not fix me, but encourage me through prayer and kindness to be a better version of myself. 

In conclusion, if you‚Äôre done with shallow, done with flaky, and ready for something deeper and more honest, please message me. I‚Äôm not flashy, I‚Äôm not famous, I‚Äôm not rich, but I am a man who is constantly trying to build himself up and make the best out of everything, and I am doing it all through being faithful that God will provide and has my best interests in mind. I pray for the right woman to read this and recognize the heart behind it. I constantly pray for the woman God has for me, and pray for her path to be blessed and her path to be lit by the light of the Lord Jesus.

Let‚Äôs see where this road might lead, with God lighting the way. Please reach out if you are interested.

They'll be like, ‚ÄúOh yeah, everyone born between the late 1980s and early 2000s are always online talking about how no one loves them and they‚Äôre too anxious to talk to someone at a bar.‚Äù Gen Alpha will look at Gen Z and say, ‚ÄúYou guys are just Millennials but with worse music, ugly fashion, and ten layers of ironic detachment.‚Äù They see both having the nihilism. The dating dread. The constant identity crisis. Gen Alpha will say to both, ‚ÄúYou all cried about your dating lives more than Boomers cried about war.‚Äù 

To Gen Alpha, all that generational infighting online will look like a bunch of overgrown siblings fighting over who‚Äôs sadder while still using the same memes and apps. They'll say, ‚ÄúWas there even a difference between Gen Z and Millennials? They both lived in a declining society and coped with jokes, fandoms, and overpriced coffee.‚Äù 

It doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs physically difficult to tell Millennials and Gen Z apart by then unless they straight up tell you their birth year like it‚Äôs a passport check.

Like, you‚Äôll meet young white guy scrolling Instagram but are they 28 or 38? Are they Gen Z or a Millennial that just refuses to die trend wise? You don‚Äôt know. Nobody knows. They don‚Äôt even know.

Both generations dealt with the same aftermath of 9/11 and the Recessions. They both came of age with the internet, both are obsessed with talking about anxiety/depression, and both have a parasocial relationship with YouTubers and influencers. Gen Alpha is going to look at that and be like, ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre all the same. You just wore different ugly jeans.‚Äù

Even their slang bleeds together. Millennials still say ‚Äúyas‚Äù unironically now, and Gen Z is saying ‚Äúcringe‚Äù and ‚Äúbased,‚Äù which sound like they came from some Millennial era Reddit black hole. You both made trauma your entire personality. You both curated your Spotify playlists like they were religious texts. You both turned dating into a psychology thesis.

So when Gen Alpha shows up, they‚Äôre not going to waste time splitting hairs over who was born in 1992 versus 2002. They‚Äôre just going to point to both groups and say, ‚ÄúYou all were sad, terminally online, dressed the same, and couldn‚Äôt hold a conversation without referencing a meme or a movie. Same species.‚Äù

Prologue
 
I remember when I was a kid and how I read about stars.
 
I thought about all the different kinds of stars, and how they were all so similar but so different, and it was interesting to see how many stars there were in comparison to planets. What they were made of, how they came to be. There was one that I liked the most, though, and it was the biggest one; it was the Sun.
 
I loved the Sun, it‚Äôs what gives life to plants, energy to homes, and unfortunately burns someone when they stay outside for too long. Space is so misunderstood, and unknown and wide. And when I learned about stars, all I‚Äôve ever wanted to do was swim in the unknown surrounding the Sun.
 
I had an arsenal of unknown infinity in my bedroom, and I was overjoyed. There were NASA logos throughout my room, on my walls, on my dresser, and even on my comforter for my bed. As a 12-year-old boy, having a space bed set wasn‚Äôt the most popular thing, but I didn‚Äôt care about what other kids said. I mean, I‚Äôm sure there were boys in my grade that still had Spider-Man pajamas, so who was I to care.
 
If you were to take a look at me, I looked like a kid that liked everything and anything about science, anyway. And I‚Äôm sure if there were poster-child auditions for NASA, I would have gotten the role before stepping into the audition room. I had the nerdy glasses, the ones that fell down my nose, and I had to push them up about every minute.
 
On the weekends, I would help my mom cook dinner and sometimes we would bake together. Even though I was a very nerdy, science-y kid, I still wanted to take time to bake with my mom.
 
There was one day that I had an accident in the kitchen, one I haven‚Äôt forgotten, but one that I‚Äôve never taken seriously. It was a Saturday, because I remember my mom made her sourdough bread every Saturday, and waking up in my bed that morning, I smelled the distinct smell of the dough.
 
I remember getting out of bed, putting on my glasses, and walking out of my room clumsily into the hallway, which I thought was weird. I would usually consider myself a person who is pretty put together, I mean I‚Äôm not very haphazardly. So, when I saw my clumsy feet move step by step through blurred vision, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what was happening, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äònormal‚Äô
 
Walking into the kitchen, I remember my mom having a slightly concerned look on her face, as if she knew my condition wasn‚Äôt normal for me.
 
‚ÄúSweetheart, are you ok? It looks like you‚Äôre walking around with the sun in your eyes. Are you feeling alright?‚Äù
 
My mom had a habit of making serious situations lighter by adding a bit of humor to them, which both my father and I admired about her, considering we couldn‚Äôt do that. Regardless, I still don‚Äôt understand why she made that joke, considering I have no idea what that meant.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok, I think.‚Äù I said groggily, ‚ÄúMaybe I just slept wrong. Do we have any medicine for headaches?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYes, we should have something, I‚Äôll run and get it.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúThanks mom. I‚Äôm not sure why my head hurts so much.‚Äù
 
I swore she said something, but I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what she said though. It almost sounded like ‚Äúit‚Äôs the day.‚Äù
 
While my mother was leaving the kitchen, I heard the timer for the sourdough in the oven, it was done and needed some time to rest out of the oven. Since I was in the kitchen already, I started to get oven mitts on to take it out. I had done it a hundred times; how would this time be any different?
 
I remember the mitts being green with white spots, I think they were checkered. They were big oven mitts, I remember this because they would almost go to my elbows, and it seemed like I had a suit of armor with them on.
 
After putting on the gloves and opening the oven door, I grabbed the pot where the bread was being made and felt an odd sensation that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.
 
Heat.
 
I looked down at my hands and felt my hands against the searing pot.
 
As soon as I touched the pot, I felt no pain, but I heard a hum. A hum that seemed to last for an hour, which was much longer than the time I held onto it. It was an ominous, ghastly noise, it was like the reverberations from the hum sprouted death from its noise. If I had one way to describe it, I would say it was blinding.
 
‚ÄúBen, let go of the pot!‚Äù My mom screamed. I couldn‚Äôt let go; I was frozen.
 
‚ÄúMy hands aren‚Äôt moving, Mom! Help me!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúA little longer, Bennnnnnjamin‚Äù someone said to me, but I didn‚Äôt know who said it.
 
I remember the heat, and the pain, but I don‚Äôt know why I held on to that pot. I just remember as soon as I let go, as if I was permitted to do so, my hands were a mess of burnt, blackened skin, I lost my fingertips and all the skin on the surface of my hands.
 
The strangest part, almost as strange as my hands being glued to the pot itself, was the distinct mark I saw on my right hand, but not my left. But there was no symbol or part of the pot that would make that mark.
 
‚ÄúDo you like your new tattoo? Don‚Äôt worry, this one isn‚Äôt some boring temporary one.‚Äù The voice spoke again.
 
My mother looked wondrously at the mark, she took a couple seconds to look at it before coming to her senses, realizing my hands were scorched.
 
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you let go? Your poor hands...‚Äù My mother was shocked.
 
‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know. I just couldn‚Äôt. It hurts so bad!‚Äù I said, horrified at myself.
 
I didn‚Äôt cry when I sat on the floor with my mother as she interrogated me. I just stared at the mark. I stared at it when it turned from a barely visible mark to a black symbol on my hand, as dark as night, and as barren as space.
 
‚ÄúCome up off the floor, let‚Äôs get you to the hospital.‚Äù Mom said.
 
I reluctantly did so, still holding my hands out in front of me.
 
As we were on our way to the hospital, the pain grew, and I couldn‚Äôt hold back tears. It was awful, the pain and the entire experience. It just didn‚Äôt make any sense.
 
‚ÄúHoney, why didn‚Äôt you put the gloves on?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúW-What?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúThe oven mitts, you didn‚Äôt put them on.‚Äù
 
Now I was terrified, I swore I put them on. I remember how they felt on my arms.
 
‚ÄúI thought I did, I remember putting them on!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBen, the gloves were on the kitchen counter still.‚Äù
 
I didn‚Äôt understand. What was happening to me, and why me?
 
At that point, I remember sitting in the car looking at my hands, almost hypnotized by my lack of carefulness. I had so, so many questions.
 
But what was the hum echoing through my head and whose voice did I hear when I touched the pot?
 
 
Chapter 1
 
I woke up and smelled the Coors off my breath and in the cans on the floor. After wincing at the brilliant sunlight coming through my curtains, I metamorphosized from being groggy to my dreary, conscious state, knowing I needed to get my ass up.
 
I didn‚Äôt want to get up for my job, but it was a job, just not a NASA position. All I did was take pictures of space and send them to the company I worked for, which was a textbook company that included pictures of space and stars. It made me money, so I can‚Äôt complain.
 
I got up, put my almost broken glasses on my face, and got ready to edit pictures I took the night prior. This was my every morning routine, and usually it involved me getting a little bit of whiskey in my coffee. That was probably one of the only things in my day that I looked forward to. And that probably made me an alcoholic.
 
Luckily, I got to work on my own time, and that meant I didn‚Äôt have to deal with people annoying me off with questions I had no desire to answer. There is only one time, however, where I must endure a lot of stupid questions: the company dinner. It‚Äôs only once a year, but the last couple years or so I haven‚Äôt bothered to go, even though I have nothing better to do.
 
I confessed my frustration about this event constantly to two people, my friend and coworker Aaron, and my partner-in-crime, the printing service employee in my hometown, Gary. Poor Gary gets most of that, Aaron not so much.
 
Like last week at lunch, when I got the email on my phone and groaned. Both looked up in surprise, they didn‚Äôt know I was capable of such explicit negative emotion.
 
‚ÄúThe hell‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù Gary teased. ‚ÄúYou get one of ‚Äòem fancy emails like last year?‚Äù I swear his voice is just a stereotypical Southern accent from any Southern movie ever.
 
‚ÄúYeah, I just got the email too. It‚Äôs that stupid dinner party again.‚Äù Aaron shrugged and crossed his arms. He had his own reasons for disliking the party.
 
‚ÄúWell damn, looks like you boys got a party to go to!‚Äù I told Gary to please lower his voice and enthusiasm for something he‚Äôll never have the money to attend.
 
Gary made a noise and trudged out the restaurant. Aaron sighed and shot me a look that called me out.
 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be a dick to him just because you don‚Äôt want to do something. What are you, a toddler?‚Äù
 
My occasional temper and hotheaded nature are usually quelled by Aaron‚Äôs calm, yet stern personality. It was a good balance between us.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll apologize to him later, I‚Äôm supposed to print off some pictures later that I took last night. Pretty sure his shift started soon anyway.‚Äù
 
He smiled a bit and then pat my shoulder. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go. I have to get some sleep in a bit so I can take more pictures tonight.‚Äù I always thought his sleep schedule was weird.
 
Aaron was experienced in the job, I would say more than me. His parents worked in a couple different companies and organizations that operated from NASA. They made Aaron go into this field. And even though he was good at it, he didn‚Äôt want to do it. He even got three different work opportunities from NASA, but he had declined all of them.
 
But Gary, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt so lucky with his opportunities. He flunked out of college after barely passing high school, but he got the job he‚Äôs in now because it‚Äôs the family business. A couple days a week, I dropped by the printing office and had peculiar or admirable shots printed, just to keep for myself.
 
All three of us had a tradition to go to our favorite bar downtown every Friday night, not necessarily to socialize with people at the bar, but just to come by and catch up. We‚Äôve probably had this tradition for about a year or two, and I started inviting Gary recently.
 
I got to the bar first this time, and Aaron came through the doors a couple minutes after I did. He looked a bit different than usual, something seemed off, but I brushed it aside. He smiled at me and sat down.
 
Gary didn‚Äôt come by in the first ten minutes, which was a sign that he wasn‚Äôt coming at all. This was pretty normal recently, though.
 
Aaron and I talked about our own individual work and the struggles that came with it, we complained about his family and expressed guilt for mine.
 
Aside from my parents, I didn‚Äôt really know any of my family. Neither my mother or my father introduced me to anyone, and now that I mentioned it, they never really talked about them. For the last 9 years, it‚Äôs been harder and harder to talk to them about things, especially my family, since they both got sick when I went into high school.
 
‚ÄúRot.‚Äù The voice in my head demanded maliciously and broke me out of a stupor.
 
‚ÄúBen, you alright?‚Äù I felt beads of sweat drop from my face and the stare of my friend inviting me to speak. Being careful not to have Aaron notice, I pulled the glove onto my right hand tighter to my wrist.
 
‚ÄúYeah, sorry.‚Äù Being honest about that voice hasn‚Äôt been easy lately. ‚ÄúWhat were you saying about your parents?‚Äù I said, rubbing my head.
 
Aaron looked concerned, it seems like for more than one reason. ‚ÄúJust that they were being very prominent about this NASA operation they heard about. I forget the name of it, but they mentioned it being one of the most confidential tasks the administration has had.‚Äù Aaron said. I‚Äôve never heard him mention anything specific about any NASA information relayed from his parents, and it concerned me that he did this time.
 
‚ÄúSounds so interesting, right up your alley.‚Äù I said sarcastically. I tend to make jokes when I‚Äôm nervous, I think both Aaron and I do that.
 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn about it‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why my parents are still so insistent on me following in their footsteps. I feel like Harry Osborn in Spider-Man. Specifically the one with Tobey.‚Äù He spoke.
 
I chuckled at the reference. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just what they think is best for you. I mean, they can see you are going on a good path, and you are talented with this sort of work.‚Äù
 
Aaron seemed frustrated, not at me, but the subject. ‚ÄúYeah well, they sucked at being parents, but they wanted to be the best work connections. I‚Äôve just had enough. They keep sucking me into all their work issues and projects, even though I‚Äôm fine with where I‚Äôm at. Honestly, I‚Äôve felt happier at this job more than ever these past couple of weeks.‚Äù
 
I felt bad, this wasn‚Äôt something I could relate to. I dismissed the subject, and realized how busy the bar was, which gave us the signal to leave and part ways.
 
Walking out of the bar, Aaron always goes right, and I go left. It‚Äôs always been like that. He went left with me, and it caught me off guard. He still seemed off. He had the same look on his face from when he got to the bar, and his shoulders seemed to stay by his neck, almost as if he was in a permanent shrug position. I may not be the best communicator, but I am very good at reading body language.
 
‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù
 
He looked at me with a fear I‚Äôve never seen in his eyes before. A fear I‚Äôve never seen from anyone.
 
‚ÄúThat project I mentioned, it‚Äôs hell on earth. I don‚Äôt give a shit if my parents want me to do it. I saw the file for it; I‚Äôve never heard anything like it. I wish I never opened that fucking folder.‚Äù
 
That fear set in those eyes of his started to creep into me.
 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What was in the file? You know you can talk to me, Aaron, I see how this is bothering you.‚Äù It really started to worry me, too. And I don‚Äôt get worried easily
 
‚ÄúBen, you don‚Äôt understand. No one in NASA wants to volunteer for this project, there isn‚Äôt one board member that wants to look further into it, the board wants it dismissed. It‚Äôs like I said, it‚Äôs one of the most confidential projects they have.‚Äù
 
From above me, I felt a presence that I hadn‚Äôt felt in some time, like something was watching me. It wasn‚Äôt a bird or anything flying above, but it felt like something I couldn‚Äôt see, or something that didn‚Äôt want me to see it. It made me feel uneasy, but the noise, the hum made me feel worse.
 
I began to shake a bit, but at this point I was too terrified to care. He looked more like a paranoid drug addict than his calm, collected self. I felt like I have seen this kind of thing before, but I couldn‚Äôt place it at the time.
 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me we contacted something. Not something from out there.‚Äù I was terrified.
 
‚ÄúNo, they contacted us. All I can say is one thing, something I‚Äôve heard from my parents, they seemed deranged talking about it. They say whatever contacted us made its first notice years ago.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòsomething?‚Äô‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo one knows what it is, or what its name is.‚Äù Aaron whispered, tears beginning to form around his eyes. I had never seen any sort of strong emotion like this come from him.
 
He took a deep breath, and immediately shuddered, tears hitting the sidewalk a couple paces from the bar. He then reached into his work bag, which he brings with him everywhere, even to the bar each Friday.
 
‚ÄúTake it, I don‚Äôt want anything to do with it. That file has been the bane of my fucking existence.‚Äù He handed me a yellow file; it was so heavy I almost dropped it when he shoved it into my hands.
 
As Aaron gave me the file, the burn mark on my hand started to tingle, and then seemed to start to burn, as if someone put a hot iron on my hand. It was an excruciating, highly unsettling feeling, and I had never experienced this before. I thought Aaron would mention it, or ask what‚Äôs wrong, but he simply left, eager to get away from the file that tormented him.
 
As he was walking away, I noticed how quick his pace was. He walked in a quick, almost forced pace. It made my skin crawl to see how worried he was. But I didn‚Äôt know anxiety and fear made someone have limp feet, he was dragging them behind him. He walked as if he had Parkinson‚Äôs or something, like he couldn‚Äôt control his body.
 
‚ÄúI thank you for the invitation, Benjamin.‚Äù The voice said, it sounded as if whatever was speaking was smiling.
 
I looked down at the bulky, beige folder my friend, who now seemed like a stranger, gave to me. The file read, in bold, red lettering:
 
Ashbed.
 
Chapter 2
 
When I was a kid, my mom sang me a song and read me a story to me before I went to bed. She seemed to know all the words and tunes to my bedtime routine, which surprised me since she didn‚Äôt read or sing from any book. She just knew everything she was saying.
 
I never understood anything she said to me while singing, it wasn‚Äôt in English. But I didn‚Äôt care, I was a kid. Recently, though, I‚Äôve been thinking about the song, and how it sounded. As a child, I was delighted and excited to hear the song, I looked forward to it every night. Now, it doesn‚Äôt have the same comfort to give me. It only gives me
 
‚ÄúFear.‚Äù
 
My parents took videos of me as a child, they were old VHS home videos that lay buried in our attic, among many boxes no one has the motivation to go through. I remember seeing a couple when my parents got sick, going through those boxes gave me something to do when I was home from college.
 
One of the videos that I saw while I was on summer break terrified me so much, I never wanted to watch another home video from the attic again.
 
I‚Äôm pretty sure this video had a number on it, a fraction really. It read ‚Äú37/39,‚Äù which probably indicated that there were 39 total tapes that were made. Why 39? Not a clue.
 
When the film started, I knew from the background that the location of interest was the living room. The orange couch I pretended to be a spaceman on lay against the yellow paint of the walls.
 
I was yelling something in a much longer voice than I should‚Äôve been, I couldn‚Äôt even hear anything else in the video. Just a chant my mom used to say to me, and now I was saying it as I jumped up and down on the couch like it was my personal anti-gravity jump pad.
 
I did quiet down though. I almost went to a whisper.
 
‚ÄúHow do I not remember any of this‚Äù I spoke aloud, grateful no voice in my head answered me. He has a bad habit of finishing my sentences sometimes.
 
My life after receiving that file didn‚Äôt feel the same. I thought it was downhill anyway, but this seemed like I was trying to swim up a waterfall. It‚Äôs been about a week now, and I haven‚Äôt heard from Aaron since.
 
That feeling of being watched didn‚Äôt stop, but it didn‚Äôt necessarily get worse over time. There were sometimes that I hadn‚Äôt felt like someone was staring at me. I felt better when I went inside just about any building.
 
The other thing I noticed was that it got hotter, but it was October, and last week it was about twenty degrees cooler. I hated the heat, I always have.
 
To add to these issues, I have felt increasingly scared and paranoid at just about everything. Not only that, but I get physically angry and violent if I‚Äôm too overwhelmed, which isn‚Äôt normal for me. With my mood changing, I started to take my meds again, they helped me a bit with my anxiety.
 
But I had someone to visit today. Something told me I had to, it seemed like the only thing that might help me. I went down the street to my apartment in the small town I‚Äôve lived in all my life and arrived at the cemetery.
 
My dad‚Äôs grave was one of the brightest gravestones I had ever seen, and every time I go to visit him, it always shocks me. On some days, it‚Äôs so bright I feel the need to put sunglasses on to block the rays of the sun that bounce off it into my eyes.
 
Walking down the trail, I felt uneased to see my father‚Äôs name etched in the eternal stone of death, like I did last Saturday, and the Saturday before.
 
‚ÄúHey, dad. Sorry It‚Äôs been a bit; I‚Äôve been busy lately.‚Äù My voice came out shakingly.
 
I set the roses on his grave.
 
‚ÄúLife has been weird lately, pops.‚Äù I said, sitting down in front of the stone. ‚ÄúActually, it‚Äôs been fucked. I found that tape from the attic, and I keep thinking about mom. And damn near everything else in my life has been all over the place. Aaron hasn‚Äôt called me in a while, and I just can‚Äôt-‚Äù My tears started flowing.
 
The remnants of my tears landed on the gravestone, and sizzled when they landed. They kept coming, and the hissing continued. It went on for a minute or two, and then I stopped. Eyes still closed, I caught the scent of metal.
 
Blood was cooking onto the stone, it covered every inch of my body, and I had to wipe it off my eyes and face so I could see. The crimson liquid poured through my fingers, and I felt my heart stop.
 
Opening my eyes, I realized I was still in front of my father‚Äôs grave. But the stone wasn‚Äôt bright or intact anymore. It was split, and some parts had been charred. Its brilliant light was dimmed to a dark, shadowy form.
 
I looked to see if the other graves were still intact, but they were gone. So was the grass, the sky, and all the light. I sat, with my father‚Äôs grave, in the depths of space, unknowing of how I got there or if it was real.
 
‚ÄúHow the hell did I get here?‚Äù I was panicked, my heart practically throbbing in my chest, and my muscles as tense as the stone in front of me.
 
‚ÄúBenajaminnnnnn.‚Äù
 
I reeled around behind me, then to my sides. All around me, the voice spoke to me in an echoing, bellowing roar. The voice that had been in my head for so long was no surrounding me, from everywhere and anywhere I looked.
 
‚ÄúWhat do you want? Who are you?!‚Äù I screamed, just as fearful as I was angry.
 
The voice laughed at me, it sounded like a maniacal, mocking tone. He was toying with me, trying to make me break.
 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in my head for years! What do you want from me?!‚Äù
 
The laughing stopped abruptly.
 
‚ÄúHow na√Øve you are, child. My voice has been the epicenter of your life, and you think it‚Äôs only been years.‚Äù The voice chuckled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with you for much, much longer.‚Äù
 
In the distance of the desolate wastes of darkness, a faint, red star emerged. It blinked several times before glowing, shrouding my vision with luminous vermillion rays. As painful it was to look at, it was painful to feel it‚Äôs rays on my body.
 
‚ÄúThrough each fleeting moment of your life, I‚Äôve been right here, Benjamin. Allll your life, I was pleased to be the higher power influencing your every, insignificant move.‚Äù
 
The light grew closer, sweeping away the hair on my head. The smell of scorched hair and burning skin disgusted me. I couldn‚Äôt believe the immense power the star held. I felt like someone put me in a stove; the pain was incomprehensible.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been RIGHT HERE, all this time! Can you believe it, I‚Äôm the angel on your shoulder!!‚Äù
 
My mouth erupted into a burning roar of fury and terror. My eyes wouldn‚Äôt let me look away from the sight in front of me. The bones of my hands started to become visible, not long before they burned away too.
 
‚ÄúGo back to hell, you fucking MONSTER!!‚Äù It was the only thing I could manage to shriek from my melting throat.
 
The star, as it became closer and closer, went from a red to a bright, demonic orange orb. It blasted the remnants of my limbs away, leaving me with a shell of my physical being.
 
A scream erupted from the hell around me. It was like a concussive blast, ripping away any faith of escape I had. It took my willpower and consumed it in one bite.
 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, Benjamin! My job is not done; I can‚Äôt go home just yet!‚Äù The voice lashed its words against the rest of my body, making me plead for the release of death, for the rest of my being to crumble to dust and scatter amongst the stars. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be mine for as longggg as I want you to be!!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have a HELL OF A TIME, BENJAMIN!!‚Äù
 
When I came to, the noise ended, and I felt the grass on my hands again. I was sobbing, and I reached to feel my body unharmed and back to normal. The illusion was gone, but I still felt blood on my head, and my hand.
 
While I was in space talking to what seemed to be the devil himself, I was punching my fathers‚Äô grave with my left hand. Several of my fingers were mangled, and bones protruded from them. What seemed to awake me from the illusion, however, wasn‚Äôt my broken fingers and hand, but the wound from my head.
 
I got another mark, and it was covered in blood. It wasn‚Äôt like the mark I had before on my hand, but it was just as horrifying. The shape was a triangle enveloped in a circle. I didn‚Äôt know what it meant, but it terrified me.
 
Before rushing to get to my car to go to the hospital, I heard one final comment from the voice.
 
‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre mine. Welcome to my Hell.‚Äù
 
Chapter 3
 
Since my parents got sick and were bedridden, they couldn‚Äôt help me with getting my driver‚Äôs license. I had to work with the teacher at my school to help me get my hours in. I will say, they sucked at teaching me, but I got pretty good at it. But driving with broken hands was not at all a part of the driving experience. I doubt my parents could have helped with that too.
 
My car sped down streets, occasionally hitting a curb or two. My hand was on fire, giving me the highest sensation of pain I thought I could feel. Whatever this voice, this thing is, it can‚Äôt stop coming after me. And it can‚Äôt stop messing up my hands. What the hell is it, and what does it want with me?
 
Arriving at the hospital, I ran into the emergency wing, and they had me in a private accommodation room in no time. I had surgery as soon as the doctor could come in. Oddly enough, it was the same doctor who treated my burned hands when I was a kid, and when I got the first mark.
 
‚ÄúWell Ben, you got some awful fractures in your hand. You‚Äôre lucky that you can still use it.‚Äù The doctor mentioned solemnly. I forgot his name until I saw the shiny name tag dangling from his neck.
 
‚ÄúYeah, thanks Dr. Winchester.‚Äù I was too panicked and angry to be sarcastic. I‚Äôm just glad my hand and forehead are all bandaged up.
 
‚ÄúJust give it some time. I‚Äôll give you some medication for the pain and healing, but you won‚Äôt be able to use your left hand to its fullest extent for a while. Also, I can provide some ointment for the wound on your forehead, too.‚Äù Dr. Winchester said, a worried expression crossing his face.
 
I looked up at him, and I think he knew I was scared. ‚ÄúI appreciate it‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBen, what did you say happened to your hand?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúSome equipment of mine fell onto my hand‚Äù It was a lie, and I‚Äôd be damned to tell him the truth. He wouldn‚Äôt believe me, no one would.
 
‚ÄúI see. Well, just give me a call if you need anything.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYep, will do.‚Äù
 
I walked out of the hospital, and I felt just as bad as when I ran in. Sure, physically I was good, but I was all sorts of messed up otherwise.
After getting home, the last thing I wanted to do was start working. I had looked into the deepest reaches of space somehow, and I still can‚Äôt get that voice out of my head. The burning scent of my body being torn to shreds won‚Äôt leave my nose, either.
 
I sat down at the counter, poured myself a drink, and emptied the glass as fast as I poured it. I did that again, and again, and again. I drank until the bottle was empty, and then I threw it on the ground.
 
Tears streamed down my face again, and I was back to being in the darkest parts of my soul. I walked slowly to my room, laid on the bed, and cried until I fell asleep.
 
I woke up several hours later to what sounded like a stampede in the dining room. My body lunged to sit up in my bed, listening to what could have made that sound.
 
I swore I locked the door to my place when I came back from the hospital.  Did someone break into my place? There is one, maybe two people that could have known where the spare key was located, in case of an emergency.
 
Getting up, the floorboards underneath me just barely creaking, I took a bat out of my open closet and headed to the dining room.
 
I wish I could hear any additional noise, but my heart moved to my ears, and I was so consumed by fear that I was shocked my legs were still moving, growing closer and closer to what could be the monster I encountered earlier that day.
 
Walking into the kitchen, my fear of death was replaced by a sense of confusion and shock.
 
Everything in my apartment was a mess. Drawers and doors were flung open and torn from their hinges, dishes and silverware lay on the floor broken and strewn around. Food from the fridge and cabinets were open and flung around the place like a Jackson Pollack painting. The lights flickered, making every inch of the apartment light up ever so slightly, before the light lost hope.
 
I was disturbed at the sight, and then I saw something that made me freeze, my gaze frozen on what horror I was looking at. It made my blood boil as if I was over a fire, and it convinced me God was not watching over me.
 
Among the mess of my apartment, Aaron was hunched over, looking as if he was eating something. His back was turned towards me, and the sounds of him eating was that of a wild dog finding an old carcass, finally finding a source of energy to keep living.
 
He was clawing at the floor, his hands a mess of ash and blood. It was as if he stuck his hands into a fire and clawed at the coals which created man‚Äôs first light. His appearance was soul crushing, his clothes matted and torn into shreds and burned on some ends. I could see his spine protruding from his back, and his ribs were just as visible.
 
He shook as he finished eating the last of the Campbell‚Äôs chunky soup that was in my pantry, letting the can hit the floor. I shuddered and gasped under my breath. As soon as I did so, he froze. He knew I was there.
 
Shaking and twitching, he slowly stood up from where he sat on my floor. The jerking movements he made reminded me of the last time I saw him, after the bar. A strong, overwhelming feeling of guilt pierced my heart, and as it did, he turned to look at me.
 
There were chunks of hair missing from his head, like someone ripped them out. Teeth were missing, some were barely holding onto his gums. Claw marks were all over his face, mostly by his eyes, which pierced into my soul, giving me a sick reminder of the monster that took me to Hell.
 
The black soulless eyes stared into mine, almost like it was looking at me to tell me that Aaron wasn‚Äôt home. And he wasn‚Äôt coming back.
 
‚ÄúB-Ben‚Äù Aaron croaked. His voice sounded like someone silenced it, like someone put a pillow over his face and expected him to talk. I whimpered at the sound of his voice.
 
‚ÄúAaron? Wh-What happened to you? We need to get you to the hospital, now!!‚Äù I said through tears.
 
He was silent for several seconds, still twitching and eyeing me. What happened next has forever been seared into my brain.
 
As Aaron opened his mouth, a voice erupted from it that wasn‚Äôt his. It gave me no indication that it was human, and it spoke in a voice so low I only heard it due to the silence that shook the entire apartment.
 
‚ÄúNo, Ben. I‚Äôm right where I want to be. We are right where we want to be.‚Äù The monster spoke.
 
Broken from my stupor of fear and regret, my hand tightened on the bat a bit as he started hobbling towards me.
 
‚ÄúAaron has told me so much about you, Ben. I had to ask him a few times, but he broke eventually.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo, not you. NOT YOU!‚Äù I screamed through my clenched teeth.
 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do to him!?!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúMe? Did I do something to him?‚Äù The voice laughed at me, drawing closer with each step Aaron‚Äôs body took.
 
‚ÄúHe read the file, the one he gave you. It seems he just couldn‚Äôt handle it. It‚Äôs not my fault he‚Äôs pitiful and weak.‚Äù He was trying to make me break now, too.
 
‚ÄúJust leave me alone‚Ä¶ Please.‚Äù I pleaded with him, who was using my friends‚Äô body like a puppet.
 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that. Although, I can give you a message that your friend just told me.‚Äù
 
I gained no hope from that statement. Both Aaron and I stopped. And then it spoke again.
 
‚ÄúHe told me you look delicious.‚Äù
 
Aaron lunged at me, his black eyes still as empty and dark, yet they had a sense of derangement. His mouth open, hands up in claws ready to tear open my flesh, headed toward me faster than a person should be able to move.
 
I tripped and fell on my back, the bat still in my hands. His ravenous jaws sank onto the wood of the bat, ripping a tooth from his mouth. As he voraciously gnawed at the bat, splinters of wood falling onto my poorly guarded face, ashes started to collect on the bat. How is that even possible?
 
Gathering enough strength, I booted his light, yet ferocious body off me, and he hit the cabinets behind him, which crashed as his head received cuts from the already broken wood. It didn‚Äôt seem to bother him, and he didn‚Äôt mind the flowing blood from his temple.
 
Sitting up, he clawed the flesh on his head, making him bleed even more.
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waitinggggg for you, Bennnn.‚Äù The voice said mockingly.
 
Too scared to respond, I swung the bat at Aaron‚Äôs face, which made a hollow thud sound and a crack in his head.
 
‚ÄúCome to the party, everyone is happy to see you! All your friends, everyone you‚Äôve ever known! We know you‚Äôre not happy to be there, but we want you there so bad!!‚Äù
 
I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. My instincts didn‚Äôt tell me to stop and listen, it told me to bash Aaron‚Äôs brains in. I needed that voice to stop talking to me.
 
Hitting Aaron‚Äôs gaunt body over and over, I screamed at the top of my lungs as if I was a man going to war. Each hit broke a bone, his ribs, his legs, his forearms, all of it. I couldn‚Äôt stop, not even after I realized he stopped moving entirely.
 
He croaked one last time, sitting in the pool of his blood. I didn‚Äôt see it then, but it reminded me of a story I had heard in school. It was the story of a boy using wax to give himself freedom, not soon after falling from the sky.
 
Falling to my knees, dropping the bat from my right hand, I stared at my friend‚Äôs corpse. He looked dead now, but he already looked dead before he saw me.
 
Unexpectedly, I said a prayer to myself, and one to Aaron. I was never religious, but I hoped it fixed something in me that had broken as I killed my friend.
 
As someone grabbed my shoulder with an icy grip, laying softly on my bare skin, my sorrow dissipated.
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù
 
Looking up slowly, I saw that the figure that was speaking wasn‚Äôt human, and it wasn‚Äôt like anything I had ever seen. It was a black shroud, with stars dotted around its body, it looked like someone painted them on there.
 
The fingers of the being itself were long and slender, and there were sharp talons on the ends of them. While the hand lay on my shoulder, I felt like my flesh would succumb to the hopeless, desolate despair that was death. It rid me of any hope, yet again.
 
A bright, evil sun lay in the center of its chest, surrounded by stars. Beams of light and crescents stemmed from it, making it look more like a symbol than the biggest star. Its eyes were bleak, they were just two stars looking down on me. It had no face, just those eyes.
 
‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I muttered, tears rolling down my face just like the hope leaving my spirit.
 
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your mom tell you? She told you my name over and over. Don‚Äôt you remember sitting by her side, while she was sick and suffering?‚Äù The empty face grew a smile.
 
It was true, she said a name many times, I hated when she said it. For a whole year, that‚Äôs the only word she ever said.
 
Realization hit me, and it must have been drawn on my face that I knew. The being leaned down, it‚Äôs face right in front of mine.
 
‚ÄúGo ahead and say it, Ben.‚Äù
 
Without thinking, I spoke and said the name that haunted me for years. When my parents were sick, when I was left to be my own person with them left in their beds, and the name that entered my dreams at night.
 
It was the name of the voice in my head since I got the mark on my hand, the name of the devil on my shoulder for years. It was pure evil, and a name I never said aloud.
 
‚ÄúUtu.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBingo.‚Äù
 
As Utu disappeared before my eyes, I remember falling forward, hitting my head on a broken drawer on the floor, and passing out.

Tony Aldy could hardly believe his eyes, or his wife‚Äôs screams. Just five short months after Tony busted down the door of his $15 million mansion for the very first time, he watched its final embers burn in a pile of rubble.¬†

An NBA title run comes with immense glory‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand in this case, sanctification‚Äîbut leaves a long road behind. The Lakers spent months battling the best in basketball, finally conquering a Bucks squad even more talented than the one which bested them a year ago. The series went the full nine yards, seven games, where Mattingly helped secure the ultimate revenge in a stunn‚Ä¶

Anyway, all of this expository recap to say: Tony and his wife Delilah had been on the road to the Finals for several months and failed to hire a house-sitter for their grand estate, a suggestion from Delilah which Tony wholeheartedly ignored thanks to a new budgeting kick that had him cutting costs.¬†

Unfortunately, Tony‚Äôs thought back at the gravesite was correct. He *had* left the stove on, all four burners, in fact, Chris Early informed him. The part-time hoops phenom and full-time Orange County Fire Chief was covered in soot as he relayed the autopsy.¬†

‚ÄúSo, the vat of shoe polish caught quick fire after the flames rose high enough, which likely occurred not too long after you left, since the burners were left on full blast. Plus, we can pinpoint that the fire started between the time you claim to have walked out the door and the time your airplane took off from the LAX Airport.‚Äù

Early received a telegram and informed his elite special fire-fighting unit that it was time to wrap up. ‚ÄúTag ‚Äôem and bag ‚Äôem, boys. We‚Äôre movin‚Äô out,‚Äù he commanded.¬†

Aldy needed refuge but also had an offseason beginning, which meant a brand new roster to assemble to try for a repeat championship. Not enough time in the day, eh. So he devoted that afternoon to drawing up the plans for his latest and greatest luxury abode.¬†

His blueprints featured hieroglyph drawings depicting ancient slaves building the Pyramids of Giza, which he would like replicated in an expansive property nestled between Santa Clarita and Bakersfield. The project, named ‚ÄòAldylantis,‚Äô began the next morning with Dave Ramsey overseeing the financials and Delilah managing construction as a whole.

Tony Aldy had sold off portions of the next season‚Äôs cap space to invest in this project, and would serve as its feudal sort of lord, a pharaoh perhaps, aiming to own the town‚Äôs industries like a benevolent Brad Wesley from the 1989 action masterpiece, *Road House*.

The next morning, Laker general manager Rob Pelinka caught Tony‚Äôs arm on the way into the team facility and insisted on coffee, which he already had whipped up and sitting at a table ready for the both of them.¬†

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù guessed Aldy. He made a large motion to pull his chair out from under a pitifully small cylindrical table, flipping it around to rest his chest into the chairback.¬†

Pelinka drew a sip of coffee and blathered on about the financial strain on the Lakers‚Äô roster-building prospects and other whatnot while Aldy couldn‚Äôt help his suspicion the coffee was poisoned as part of a power play by rival members of Lakers‚Äô brass who wanted to consolidate his future financial security for their own, selecting Pelinka to spearhead the movement.¬†

Aldy smacked the coffee off the table and snapped at a bewildered Pelinka that he could tell his problems to his new secretary unless he wanted to be reminded of why the old one flew the coop.¬†

Aldy was scared all day of the alternate reality he made up in his head during the morning coffee with Pelinka. No matter, he tried to shake off the superstition with a dramatic gym session topped off by a two-mile swim. After his workout, Aldy snorted at the morning‚Äôs wild thought and invited Pelinka to the team steam room with him.¬†

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do that, you moron!‚Äù Pelinka screamed at Aldy as both men had shed their towels to rise nude in some sort of masculine-coded stand-off, shouting at each other about the minutiae of Nigel Williams-Goss‚Äô second-year team option.¬†

Aldy tried to convince Pelinka that while Goss put together tremendous stats throughout the year and was a screaming bargain, he just couldn‚Äôt be counted on to guard the cage of an encaptured NBA superstar from a rival team. Pelinka reasoned that the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most prestigious and well-respected sports franchises on the entire planet, could not carry out business in the horrific manner Aldy just detailed.¬†

‚ÄúIs that really how we won the NBA Finals this time?‚Äù he asked.¬†

‚ÄúEarly did play in the last few games, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù Aldy responded.¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù quipped Pelinka.¬†

‚ÄúThen we won despite it‚Äîand despite that weak muskrat Goss,‚Äù Aldy finished.¬†

Rob Pelinka threw his hands in the air and Aldy grabbed them, forcing them to his sides before metaphorically donning his theatre cape. Tony turned into James Cromwell‚Äôs character, Dudley Smith, from the 1997 film *LA Confidential* and issued a chilling warning to Pelinka.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the eye for human weakness to be a great leader,‚Äù he told Pelinka. ‚ÄúOr the stomach. But you‚Äôre a political animal, Rob.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù said Pelinka.¬†

‚ÄúAm I? Would you be willing to plant corrobative evidence on a player we needed to get removed from a series?‚Äù Aldy asked.¬†

‚ÄúTony, we‚Äôve been over this. No,‚Äù answered Pelinka.¬†

‚ÄúWould you be willing to beat a referee within an inch of his life to ensure a friendly whistle in the championship series?‚Äù Aldy continued.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Pelinka, again.¬†

‚ÄúWould you be willing to shoot a guy like Lebron James in the ass with your musket mid-game‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldy pressed.¬†

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù interrupted Pelinka.¬†

‚ÄúThen for God‚Äôs sake, Rob, don‚Äôt be a basketball executive,‚Äù he told the 50-year-old toddler and then clapped his left facial cheek for good measure before exiting the steam room with stomps loud enough to shake the entire facility.¬†

After setting Rob Pelinka on the right course, Aldy and the Laker front office were able to attack free agency and the NBA Draft with supreme aggression and total leadership alignment. Of course, the draft would come first on a fateful summer evening.¬†

Rick Pitino represented Los Angeles at the lottery. But they won the NBA title, right? Well, Adam Silver had allowed the Lakers to bypass the regular season, meaning they only won one total regular season game against the Grizzlies, so they‚Äôd have the second-best odds for the ‚Ññ1 pick, only trailing Memphis, who finished 0‚Äì82. Silver felt embarrassed he forgot to amend this part of the rule, allowing such a great loophole for LAL.¬†

Thanks to Rick‚Äôs elder swagger, the Lakers won the top pick while the Grizzlies were unfairly punished with a drop to sixth. The story of lottery night wound up being the grand suicidal ritual performed by the Grizzlies‚Äô general manager after a third straight season dropping steeply vs. the team‚Äôs projection.¬†

As part of this journey to another championship next summer, Aldy demanded the franchise auction off the ‚Ññ1 pick for five second-round picks and a yacht-worth of cap space.¬†

With those picks, Aldy selected the entire starting five from Dartmouth University, who blew him away with a first-round NCAA Tournament victory over higher-seeded Kansas. Most were unremarkable, but Matthew Kanerviko was a gangly and libertarian small forward with a sharp buzzcut and unrelenting sense of boyish humor. Plus, Dalton Bishop could charm a snake as a rangy socialist point guard with piercing elbows.¬†

‚ÄúWe led the draft in collective IQ!‚Äù Tony screamed at the end of draft night, believing the team had stolen away with the best haul of the offseason.¬†

Aldy put some of the lesser-talented Dartmouth picks to work in the front office cranking out some numbers on which free agents would be best to sign among the rest of the NBA pool given the team‚Äôs available cap space after a good draft day.¬†

‚ÄúLeBron,‚Äù Tony insisted. The lads gasped, but Tony smashed his hand through a floor tile and busted two knuckles with biting ferocity. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my white whale. I want him,‚Äù Aldy commanded. ‚ÄúMake it happen.‚Äù

Before the calculations and salary cap implications came into play, Aldy would need to court LeBron himself. He arranged for a private flight to the virgin deserts of western Namibia, where Aldy and James indulged in extraordinary motorsports feats. They also consumed peyote tablets and journeyed through the desert until they found an appropriate rock formation, crawling underneath it to escape the warlords in pursuit of them. Aldy and LeBron descended down the rocky cove for hours, exploring the depths of Earth and the depths of their human minds.¬†

After an intense bonding experience in lower Africa, Aldy finally convinced James that a move to Los Angeles would healthily maintain the fragile mythological context surrounding his celebrity.¬†

‚ÄúSee, it has *nothing* to do with basketball,‚Äù he taught Pelinka on the flight home, who was gobsmacked by the LeBron James news he was reading on his phone.

‚ÄúSOURCES: LeBron to LA is a done deal. He‚Äôs on his way home from Namibia this afternoon to finish signing the paperwork,‚Äù read a tweet from NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski.¬†

Adam Silver cried in sheer joy at this news from his temple in Morocco.¬†

So, the Laker roster as it stood, in Aldy‚Äôs eyes:¬†

Guards: Dave Ramsey, Nigel Williams-Goss, Seth Goodwin, Matthew Kanerviko  
Forwards: LeBron James, Max Robespierre, Mattingly

Aldy still needed a true big man and decided to check in on Joey Matthews before looking at other options. The rookie had been neglected by much of the Laker community and especially the team since his brain freeze, and it was tough to justify visiting their fallen brother in between playoff games.¬†

Dr. San Gallee was amazed that Tony was in the hospital. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs NO way you have any sort of ailment,‚Äù San Gallee joked to him. Tony‚Äôs glance couldn‚Äôt have suggested any stronger how much he despised small talk.¬†

‚ÄúMatthews!‚Äù he announced to the entire floor. San Gallee scrambled to explain that Matthews died months earlier. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Tony cursed. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me? We‚Äôre wasting good cap space on a cadaver!‚Äù he shouted at San Gallee, clenching his fists while actual steam shot out of his ears.¬†

San Gallee ran, Aldy grabbed him, subdued him, threw his lifeless body in his trunk. Tony ran a few more errands, closed a few deals and re-assessed his marriage during an ocean-side cruise in his sputtering Toyota Corolla, eventually letting a conscious San Gallee out.¬†He warned that any time an update about a Laker player wasn‚Äôt placed in front of him via telegram at the absolute earliest moment possible, then the doctor would next wake up shoeless in the slums of Juarez.¬†

Aldy was ready to finalize the roster with the addition of aging Argentinian center Luis Scola following an inspired stint of play from him in the FIBA World Cup that summer, so he called in the Dartmouth boys plus Dave Ramsey to outline the financial situation heading into the new league season.¬†

LeBron came voluntarily, in technicality, playing for a $0 salary, but accepted extremely high-risk stock options from Aldy‚Äôs personal portfolio to make up the difference. Dave Ramsey‚Äôs minimum wage salary was all the way up to $14 million per year in the state of California. Mattingly was on the second year of a deal paying him $35 million annually. The Dartmouth boys made less than a million each. Robespierre‚Äôs pay wasn‚Äôt specified into any denomination of modern currency. Seth Goodwin was making a living wage, and Nigel Williams-Goss was reluctantly retained for three shekels a week. Absorbing most of the remaining cap space was Aldy‚Äôs contract, Rick Pitino‚Äôs contract, and the principal investment on Aldy‚Äôs new pyramid project, Aldylantis, which was only covering a fraction of its expenses with the Lakers‚Äô cap space and would take most of the construction cost from California state taxpayers, since the Lakers were in the process of literally picking up and dropping the Staples Center out of the sky and on top of one of Aldy‚Äôs pyramids.¬†

Once Aldylantis was completed later that summer, Tony emerged. He had been shrouded in darkness, fasting and praying in solitude for months after a busy offseason. Meanwhile, his twisted Atlantis was complete with expansive pyramids, gorgeous oases and one world-class basketball arena.

His wife Delilah mauled him and growled, ‚ÄúUgh, I HATE how you hibernate like a bear.‚Äù¬†Tony dropped to his knees and roared so loudly at the sun that it was pushed backward from the Earth a couple of feet by the cosmic force of his vocal divinity. This act instituted a period of global cooling.¬†

The next day, Aldy‚Äôs extremely well-paid slave staff pampered the premises and prepared a royal feast while he assembled an outfit of white garments and exquisite leather sandals and tunics, plus a garland of mint leaves around his head. He had invited the entire NBA media to his house for his first public speaking outing since the 2017 NBA Finals. Reporters gawked at the decadence and faux history upon arrival while the entire Lakers‚Äô brass also joined Aldy for the big Welcome Back!

Aldy attached his thumb and index finger to Rob Pelinka‚Äôs testicles as the two sat next to each other before the service began. ‚ÄúDo not cross me,‚Äù Aldy grunted to a strained Pelinka, who coughed up an answer. ‚ÄúO‚Äôcourse!‚Äù

Jeanie Buss made her way through the introductions for a new season of Lakers hoops and welcomed up Pelinka, who discussed the exciting new championship ring on display just to his right. A showgirl went to grab the ring and present it to the audience but Tony had other intentions.¬†

Instead, Aldy nabbed the ring and placed it on his own finger while Pelinka rambled about, eventually thrusting him out of the way to take the stage. Aldy grinned and raised his hand for all to see while Buss clasped her hand over her gasp, mouthing the word ‚Äúscoundrel‚Äù to Aldy, while Pelinka stumbled for about 30 seconds before finally crashing into the ground following Tony‚Äôs light push.¬†

Quiet please. Tony Aldy is at the podium.¬†

One reporter dared go first and asked what had gotten into Aldy‚Äôs mind after reports surfaced that he masterminded the trade of the ‚Ññ1 pick. ¬†

‚ÄúSimple,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a numbers game. Five players is greater than one. One‚Äôs a really small number. You know, it‚Äôs just an analytics-based approach we‚Äôre experimenting with right now.‚Äù

Other reporters loosened up after that civil exchange, so Brian Windhorst popped a question about the complex effects of the tax burden he was placing on the state budget in the short term.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs best to avoid stepping in someone else‚Äôs dogshit,‚Äù Aldy quipped back to Windhorst with a series of head nods.¬†

Kendrick Perkins tried to ask a question but only put a few sentence fragments together, adding up to nothing more than an opinionated comment along the lines of, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your interior might.‚Äù¬†

Aldy whistled for Mattingly, who arrived and was directed toward Perkins. Perk laughed at the aging and slender power forward, who proceeded to wad Perkins up into a ball and mash him through an ulama hoop. When he finally refigured, Perkins was unable to express himself as anything other than a rectangular stone brick with a face, and he mostly emitted grunting noises for the rest of his natural life.¬†

Zach Lowe praised the Lakers for their sheer audacity and artistry from a defensive schematics standpoint and Aldy issued his first compliment ever to a media member. ‚ÄúI love you, man.‚Äù

Aldy fielded a question from one noted critic, Joy Taylor. She asked Aldy on a date, and when he roared with laughter, she focused on his personal life with allegations of rampant infidelity.¬†

‚ÄúI have never cheated the Los Angeles Lakers,‚Äù he said with disgust all over his expression.¬†

Jason Whitlock butted in next. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a scoop of that peanut butter skin ya servin‚Äô honey,‚Äù he cracked. ‚ÄúBut uh, Tony, I don‚Äôt see the vision with LeBron James. He‚Äôs the wise fool and too old to do it on the big stage any longer.‚Äù

Aldy bowed his head and answered.¬†

‚ÄúLike the padlock on the door of your haunted multi-million dollar mansion, I am a protector of all things within my domain. My slaves as much as my players and my bride. Through me, all feats are probable. Thank you everyone. Go in peace to humble yourself to this forsaken heat wave.‚Äù¬†

Tony retired to his quarters for several more months of prayer and fasting and ordered Delilah not to wake him until opening day.¬†

The same with calling people back or responding to texts he says he needs time to think of a response and confirm dates etc. and that it's because of his OCD. It must suck but it's annoying having to wait days for a text or call back so I usually wait for him to reach out. But about two weeks ago he pointed out it feels one sided he always has to make plans so this time I made plans assuming since he complained maybe he'll actually respond this time. I made plans to eat at this brunch place I've been wanting to try but three whole days go by and no response so on the third day I got annoyed and decided I'll just go with this girl I've been talking to. 

Friday comes and he texts to confirm we'll go out to eat on Saturday and I told him sorry because I was going out with ""Lily"" because he took too long to confirm I made other plans. He didn't respond until an hour after that saying that I'm a horrible friend and I don't understand what it's like to live with OCD, but mostly he was accusing me of going out with Lily to mess with him because I've done it before and that I'm ""heartless"" and I never meant my apology. For context we have very similar types and sometimes he'll tell me he likes a girl but he wont make any move to sleep with or ask her out. So usually I wait a few days or weeks and sometimes I'll make a move usually not to date them just sleep with them, there was only one time I dated a girl he claimed he was in love with he got depressed so I broke up with her. This has been an ongoing issue with him since high school if he likes them so much he should talk to them.

I don't think I could ever openly say, but I let myself wonder for a moment today. Wander, really. Some. I was fighting my age and the passing of the years and the thought occurred that maybe the thoughts I am having are because I have had them before. Or will again. I don't know; I am feeling a little scattered and in pieces of myself right now. It's part of why I'd never send this; I have an image to maintain, after all. There are all of these could-have-beens crossing my mind and what-might-bes invading my desires. The timing is so wrong. I am sad. It isn't fair. I tried to write it. It isn't very cohesive, or polished, which is fine. The shoe box doesn't judge, ha.

Someday, maybe, this and the rest will be dumped at your feet in offering of the moment you became a part of my story. I like to let myself believe you'd enjoy them, all the little vignettes and bits. It's unlikely we will ever know.¬†

The airline stewardess sneered and I knew that I could have loved you then, but I too enjoyed the champagne, and we laughed together, instead of loved. Time for that later, surely. From the airport, we rode 60 miles on a rented scooter to Mount Fuji and you held me like a pillar the entire way. I felt solid, and strong, for your arms alone. How could I have know I was a pillar, but for your arms around me? We stopped for mochi at a 7-11 and did you know they have 7-11 in Japan?

The company is complimenting your successful navigation of the Great Disagreement, and I knew then that I have loved you for so very long, that it was as natural as breathing. My chest is rising and I love you, falling and I love you. You exist at a molecular level that my body needs to survive, and every second requires you as part of me or I feel panic; I cannot breathe.

It‚Äôs very very detailed but I hope it‚Äôs helpful for someone, or an enjoyable read if you‚Äôre like me who loves reading these! üòÇ

We stayed 6/3-6/7 at Art of Animation. It was a girls trip! Myself, my 24 yr old sister, my twin 15 year old sisters, and my mom. My twin sisters had never been before and as a certified Disney Adult, I was so excited to show them the place that has always brought me so much joy. They both weren‚Äôt super excited for the trip beforehand, as teenagers can be, but by the end of our trip they both agreed they really enjoyed it more than they thought they would. One of them said she didn‚Äôt want to come back, but the other said she‚Äôd come back in a heartbeat, and I count that as a win! üòÜ lol

Resort: Art of Animation, the Little Mermaid rooms. No complaints here! Loved the immersive themeing and the room was perfect for what we needed. Such a huge win to have the Skyliner! That came in clutch after long days, and is also just so fun to ride in! We never ate at the food court, but it was fun to walk through! I know everyone said the walk from LM rooms was long, but we personally didn‚Äôt find it that bad.

Day 1, 6/3: We arrived at AoA around 4:30. My sister who currently is in her DCP met us at the resort. We got settled into our room, and jumped on the Skyliner to the Boardwalk resort. Walked around for a bit, decided we‚Äôd rather eat at Disney Springs, as there were more options for the twins. So we jumped on a bus and headed there. Walked around for a bit, and then ate at D‚ÄôLuxe Burger. 10/10; I always love eating here! Did World of Disney for a while to scope out potential souvenirs, and then headed back to the resort.

Day 2, 6/4: We woke bright and early and drove to AK. Rope dropped Flight of Passage. WOW! ü§© it was my first time on this ride, and it was incredible! I loved it so much! It‚Äôs now going to be a must do for any Animal Kingdom day! After FOP, we did Navi (15 minute wait), grabbed some new coffee from Satuli Canteen, and headed to Safaris. A 40 minute wait, but we all agreed it was definitely worth it - we saw SO MANY animals! Then, we saw the Lion King show, which is always a must see for me. We had wanted to try and ride Everest, but we had an 11:30 LL for Tower of Terror in HS, and didn‚Äôt have time.

We SPRINTED over to HS, and made our LL within the 5 minute grace period. Whoo! Saw the Frozen singalong, lunch at Backlot Express (it was fine, nothing to write home about), did Rockin (35 minute wait, never could get a LL) wandered over to Galaxy‚Äôs Edge to walk through, and saw a 30 minute wait for Rise. Jumped in line and ended up only waiting like 15!!! No idea how that happened but I‚Äôm not complaining! We then did Slinky Dog, Swirling Saucers, Mickey & Minnie‚Äôs on LL. Decided to head over to Epcot, because those LL were way easier to get than HS. At Epcot, we LL Soarin‚Äô, then had dinner in Mexico (always a great time, no complaints) One twin was able to accomplish a dream and get a bratwurst from Germany, so she was ecstatic. At this point it was about 8:30, so we decided to go hop in line for Guardians. Waited about an hour. We got Disco Inferno. Not my favorite, but it was a song I hadn‚Äôt gotten before, so I was all good! We also were able to convert my youngest sister to a rollercoaster fan after she rode this, which is just fantastic! Headed back to resort after a very great first park day!

Day 3, 6/5: Magic Kingdom! We tried to rope drop 7Dwarves, but the line was all the way into Storybook Circus, so we pivoted and went to Peter Pan. About a 25 minute wait. After, we did Haunted Mansion (Walk On), Teacups (5 mins), Pirates of the Caribbean (20 min wait). Lunch @ Columbia Harbor House, probably my personal favorite QS at Magic. Saw the Country Bear Musical Jamboree & Tiki Room. Waited 25 minutes for Jungle Cruise before my sisters hit a wall. All 3 of them headed back to the resort. Mom and I decided we‚Äôd rather do a monorail loop. Monorailed to GF, and walked around a bit, then headed to the Poly. Grabbed some coffee & sat in the lobby and people watched. Around 5:30, we all met back up at Magic, took some castle pictures, watched Philharmagic (a must do for me), waited 35 minutes for Buzz, rode PeopleMover and then grabbed dinner at Cosmic Rays. Tron was about an 80 minute wait at this point. We walked over there and headed to get in line, but then we all talked and decided we were so exhausted and wanted to be rested up for tomorrow. We bailed on Tron and headed out for the night. It was starting to rain at this point too. We were all a little bummed to miss HEA, and I have yet to see Happily Ever After in person, but I don‚Äôt regret ending the night early. It was so nice the next day to have actual sleep and feel good walking into our 3rd park day.

Day 4, 6/6, EPCOT, AK & HS
This day was my 26th birthday, and it was literally the PERFECT day. We rope dropped EPCOT, and went to Frozen Ever After (walk on) then Remy‚Äôs (25 minute wait) and then, we walked out of Remys, and the whole entire outside line was empty, so we took our chances and ended up literally WALKING ON Remy‚Äôs for a second time. No idea how this was even possible? But Remy‚Äôs is literally one of my favorite rides, so this was a great Bday gift from Mickey! After, we got breakfast at Le Halles (still dreaming about this whole meal). Then we did some front of the park rides with minimal waits; Figment, LWTL, Turtle Talk & Spaceship Earth. We grabbed lunch at Connections, and then saw that Everest was a quick wait, so we park hopped to AK. There, we walked onto both Everest and Safaris. We then came back to Epcot for our Guardians LL (we got September, the best song, and another birthday gift) and had dinner at Regal Eagle. We then Skylinered over to Hollywood, waited about 15 minutes for Toy Story Mania, and then saw Fantasmic. This is my favorite Disney show and it was incredible as always! Headed back to AoA with sore feet but very very full hearts!

All in all, this was an amazing trip and I loved getting to it with my mom and sisters! Personally, I would not stay at AoA again. I would do Pop to have the Skyliner, but not pay the extra just for more theming. We never had any issues really anywhere on property. The heat was BRUTAL but we made sure to stay hydrated and take rest breaks when needed. 

I hope this was helpful or a fun read to my fellow Trip Report lovers! Already hoping to go back this fall for a quick weekend trip, fingers crossed! ",4,1751484045.0,WaltDisneyWorld,2,1.0,False

I always do my work out before breaking my fast. One hour before hitting the gym, I drank two coffees, and 28 grams (0.3grams per kg body weight) of baking soda with lots of water. To top it off, I chugged a Red Bull during my drive to the gym.

At the gym, I did my my sets, energy through the roof, no lactic acid burn. It worked well! But then, mid squat, my stomach starts making noises along with the cramps.

Just wanted to take a moment to really appreciate the owner of my gym today. He has an absolutely amazing physique, but more importantly, he took the time to guide me as a beginner and it meant a lot.

He told me straight-up to completely avoid supplements, unlike the random social media influencers who push products without caring about the end user. He emphasized focusing on form, discipline, and proper workouts instead.

When I asked about pre-workout, he explained it‚Äôs totally optional for beginners. If I really wanted something, he said I could use whey protein as a pre-workout 3 days a week, and black coffee the other 3 days, which would be more than enough.

He also explained that all these pro bodybuilders you see on social media take a different level of supplements and many wouldn‚Äôt have those gains without steroids. He recommended that I only consider supplements after at least a year of consistent, disciplined training, and even then to test them in small quantities to avoid any adverse reactions.

I am a 26 year old guy and when I have like a ""crush"" on a girl I get really depressed. It is like void that I fall in deeper and deeper to the point I just panic and I don't enjoy life anymore. 

At the moment it's that again. I really have a big crush on a girl I basicaly only know from instagram interactions. Over the past weeks/months I slowly started to get more into her. And now I literally hit rock bottom. The worst part is that she even has a boyfriend. I cannot even ask her for like a coffee to be over it. I am tired, I lost all purpose in life, I don't enjoy hobby's anymore and I isolated myself from my friends. I cannot concentrate on my job anymore. I feel absolutely terrible and tired. She will never be my girlfriend and she is living her best life wirh her friende and her bf and I am laying completely drained and hopeless on my cough. 

I also had this exact same issue with a coworker. I also really started to like her. Difference is that I knew her from real life. She also had a bf and I couldn't get over it. 

And in the past more of these ""crushes""  

I mean I get emotionally invested into this so quickly. I think one of the issues is that the feeling is never mutual. Not a single girl ever liked me romantically. It hurts being 26 and alone and never been loved by a girl. I honestly doubt if it is ever gonna happen. And it is my big anxiety. I don't want to be alone forever, I also want a family and someone to love. 

How can it be not a single girl on this planet had ever fell in love with me? Or showed romantic interst in me? ",2,1751483709.0,self,1,1.0,False

1lq4bke,https://www.reddit.com/r/usvisascheduling/comments/1lq4bke/b1b2_visa_interview_mumbai/,"B1/B2 Visa Interview, Mumbai","### Warning : Long read ahead ###

I already hold a US B2 visa due to expire in a couple of years. My wife had applied for herself this time and got her interview scheduled at the Consulate in Mumbai last month. For context, we both are working professionals, nearing 30 yrs of age, earning comfortably well, with our base in South India. 

Once she got her visa slot scheduled, we started randomly reading experiences of many interviewees who'd graciously posted in this Reddit group. Basis this, we developed an idea about the Interview process and possible questions and in turn, I'd often pose her with mock interview questions during our morning coffee time or right before hitting the bed. We infact found this to be a fun exercise and experience that eventually got us to do some introspection in the process.

Contrary to what we'd assumed, the interview wasn't a smooth sail since the VO seemed to have posed rapid fire questions to scan her profile thoroughly. Sharing here the Q&A for fellow buddies as a mark of thanks to this forum. 

A- Applicant (my wife)

VO- Visa Officer (Male who supposedly looked to be a middle aged Indian)

A- Good morning Sir

VO- Good morning,  hand me your passport.

VO- What is your purpose of visit?

A- I intend to travel with my husband for tourism during this year end.

VO- Does your husband hold a visa?

A-Yes

VO- When did he get?

A- Around 7 to 8 years ago

VO- Has he been to the US?

A- Not yet

VO- Then why did he get?

A- He got it when he was a student. Since then, he didn't get an opportunity to go to the US and over the years got busy with work. Now is when we felt like travelling around Christmas to the US since it is when he gets long holidays.

VO- What does he do?

A- He is a YYY by qualification and currently works as XYZ in ABC.

VO- How much does he earn?

A- He has a CTC of XX LPA.

VO- How long since you've been married?

A- We got married in the year 202X.

VO- Do you stay with parents?

A- No

VO- I meant his parents.

A- Yes, we stay with our in laws.

VO- If you travel to the US, who will take care of them?

A- They are independent themselves and are still working. So, they take care very well and also not reliant on us.

VO- What do they do?

A- My FIL is a YYY by qualification and does ZYX while MIL is an employee of ZZZ.

VO- How long do you plan to travel to the US?
A- Around 2 weeks 

VO- What is your source of funds?

A- I have enough savings and also myself and my husband plan to use our own funds for the trip.

VO- What do you do?

A- I'm a YYY by qualification and currently working as a BBB in CCC.

VO- Where all have you traveled recently?

A- I've been to China, Indonesia, Thailand, Italy and France recently. 

VO- Did you go to Italy and France with your husband?

A- No, I went with my sister since my husband doesn't get long holidays often.

VO- Where all do you plan to visit in the US?

A- We'd like to visit Chicago, Las Vegas, Niagara and the Great Canyon.

VO- Keep your hands here (signaling to the machine). Your visa is approved and will reach you through your chosen mode of delivery.

A- Thank you


While most of all the questions were on lines of what we'd discussed during our mock interviews, the length of the interview to span across such a wide array of her profile got us to only think of this as a not so easy experience. Now that the visa is approved , our 2 little cents and take aways are
1) Be bold, confident  and clear with what you say. We, infact, felt its not just enough if we are honest about our answers, the clarity with which we say makes the critical call of approval vs denial. 
2) Being from a place away from the land of dreams, Mumbai has really been a lucky charm in our lives.

Okay, so you've started your Semaglutide journey. Maybe you're feeling a bit excited about the changes you're seeing, or perhaps you're just getting started. It's a powerful tool, no doubt! But then- *bam* - the nausea hits. You're not alone, believe me. It's one of the most common side effects people talk about, and it can really throw a wrench in your day, making you question if it's all worth it.

You might be wondering, ""Is this normal?"" or ""What can I even do about this?"" The good news is, yes, it's pretty normal for many, and more importantly, there are absolutely things you can do to manage it. I've been there, or know plenty who have, and I've gathered some practical, real-world tips that actually help. Let's dive in and get you feeling better!

**Why Does Semaglutide Make You Nauseous Anyway?**

It's natural to want to understand *why* your stomach feels like it's doing acrobatics. This isn't just some random side effect; it's actually tied to how the medication works its magic.

**The Science Behind the Sickness**

Semaglutide belongs to a class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. One of its key actions is to slow down gastric emptying- that's a fancy way of saying it makes food stay in your stomach longer.

* **Slower Digestion:** Food hangs around longer, helping you feel fuller for longer periods, which is great for appetite control.
* **The Downside:** If food sits too long, or if you eat too much, it can lead to that uncomfortable, queasy feeling, sometimes even heartburn or reflux. Your body is just taking its sweet time processing things.

It's often a sign that the medication is doing its job, but that doesn't make it any less unpleasant. The goal is to find a balance where you get the benefits without the constant queasiness.

**Eating Smart to Keep Nausea at Bay**

This is probably the biggest game-changer for most people dealing with Semaglutide-induced nausea. What, when, and how you eat makes a huge difference.

**Focus on Small, Frequent Meals**

Picture this: your stomach is now a slow-cooker, not a microwave. Overloading it is a recipe for disaster.

* **Portion Control is Key:** Think tiny portions, even smaller than you might be used to. A handful of nuts, half a sandwich, a small bowl of soup.
* **Graze, Don't Gorge:** Instead of three big meals, aim for 5-6 smaller 'mini-meals' throughout the day. This keeps your digestive system working without overwhelming it.
* **Listen to Your Body:** Stop eating the moment you feel satisfied, not full. That ""full"" feeling on Semaglutide often quickly turns into ""overstuffed and nauseous.""

**Choose Nausea-Friendly Foods**

Some foods are just easier on a sensitive stomach. You'll want to lean into these.

* **Bland is Your Friend:** Think toast, crackers, plain rice, boiled potatoes, skinless chicken, clear broths.
* **Low-Fat is a Must:** Fatty foods take much longer to digest, making nausea worse. Avoid greasy, fried, or high-fat meals.
* **Prioritize Protein:** Lean proteins can help with satiety without being too heavy. Think grilled chicken breast, fish, or eggs.
* **Ginger Power:** Ginger is a natural anti-nausea remedy. Try ginger tea, ginger chews, or even just a small piece of fresh ginger to nibble on. Peppermint can also be soothing.

**Foods to Seriously Limit or Avoid**

Just as there are ""safe"" foods, there are definitely ""danger"" foods when nausea is a concern.

* **Say No to Greasy, Fried Foods:** This is probably the number one culprit for many. They sit in your stomach forever.
* **Spicy and Acidic Foods:** These can irritate your stomach lining, exacerbating nausea and heartburn.
* **Sugary Treats and Drinks:** High sugar content can sometimes cause discomfort, especially sugary sodas or fruit juices.
* **Strong Smells:** Sometimes, it's not even the food itself, but the smell. If something cooking makes you queasy, step away!

**Hydration is Your Secret Weapon**

It sounds simple, but staying well-hydrated is critical, especially when nausea might make you want to avoid anything. Dehydration can actually worsen nausea.

**Sip, Don't Gulp**

* **Constant Sips:** Keep a water bottle handy and take small sips throughout the day. Don't try to chug a whole glass at once, as that can also upset your stomach.
* **Electrolyte Boost:** If you're struggling to keep food down or feel really queasy, an electrolyte drink (like clear sports drinks or oral rehydration solutions) can help replenish essential minerals.
* **Clear Broths:** Chicken or vegetable broth can provide fluids and some nutrients without being too heavy.

**What to Drink - And What to Avoid**

* **Water is Best:** Plain old water is your primary go-to.
* **Herbal Teas:** Ginger, peppermint, or chamomile teas can be very soothing.
* **Limit Caffeinated and Sugary Drinks:** Coffee, colas, and super-sweet beverages can sometimes irritate your stomach or cause a sugar crash that worsens nausea.

**Timing and Technique Matters**

Beyond what you eat, *when* and *how* you take your medication, and even your daily habits, can impact how you feel.

**Consider Your Dosing Schedule**

Many people find that the timing of their Semaglutide injection can influence side effects.

* **Evening Dosing:** Some folks report less nausea if they take their injection in the evening, allowing them to sleep through the peak initial effects. This is something to discuss with your doctor, of course.
* **Consistency:** Try to take it at roughly the same time each week to help your body adjust to a predictable schedule.

**Movement and Mindset**

Sometimes, a little shift in your routine or perspective can make a difference.

* **Gentle Movement After Eating:** Going for a short, gentle walk after a meal can sometimes help with digestion, preventing food from just sitting there.
* **Avoid Lying Down After Meals:** Try to stay upright for at least an hour or two after eating to help digestion and prevent reflux.
* **Distraction:** Sometimes, focusing too much on the nausea makes it worse. Try to distract yourself with a book, a light chore, or a conversation.

**When to Talk to Your Doctor**

While nausea is common, it's not something you just have to ""live with"" if it's severe or persistent. Your healthcare provider is your best resource.

* **Severe or Persistent Nausea:** If you're constantly nauseous, vomiting frequently, or it's significantly impacting your quality of life, it's time to call them.
* **Signs of Dehydration:** Dizziness, dry mouth, infrequent urination, or extreme thirst are red flags that you might be dehydrated and need medical attention.
* **Inability to Eat:** If nausea is so bad you can't keep food down or aren't getting enough nutrients, that's a serious concern.
* **Weight Loss Due to Sickness:** While weight loss is the goal, losing weight because you're too sick to eat isn't healthy.

Your doctor might suggest adjusting your dose, trying anti-nausea medication, or exploring other strategies. Don't hesitate to reach out!

**You've Got This!**

Dealing with nausea on Semaglutide can be really frustrating, I know. It's easy to feel disheartened when you're trying to improve your health, and a side effect like this pops up. But remember, for most people, this is a temporary adjustment period. By being mindful about what you eat, staying hydrated, and making a few simple tweaks, you can often significantly reduce the discomfort.

Be patient with your body, experiment with these tips to see what works best for you, and always keep that open line of communication with your healthcare provider. You're on a journey towards better health, and managing these bumps in the road is just part of the process. Keep going- you're doing great!",1,1751482893.0,SemaglutideWIki,0,1.0,False

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

Temperature:
I‚Äôve tried different temperature: 92C, 95C, 98C. I also checked the thermostat accuracy by flash boiling. 

Pressure:
I tried 12bar, 9bar and 8bar.

Ground distribution:
I tried with or without proper WDT. I use a bottomless portafilter and usually don‚Äôt see jets.

Beans:
I tried all different roast levels from different roasterie. But even with the dark roast I still got only sourness and astringency. (And for sure it is not the bean problem, since I tried the same beans in the shop and it has absolute sourness and astringency)

Dose and ratio:
I tried from 13g to 18g. Usually with a ratio of 1:2.25.  I tried elongated the shot to 1:2.7, and still get the same flavor.

Flow:
The flow is weird. I can hardly finish the shot for more than 35s. I aim for 30s, and for a lot of settings the shot will finish in 25-30s and be very sour. I can choke the machine. But even if the grind setting is just a little coarser than the choking setting, I got an astringency shot. The flow will usually starts at 5s, about 0.6g/s. But will gradually increase to 1.7-2g/s. 
I feel confused since Lance Hedrick mentioned a lot of times that the flow will normally be decreasing instead of increasing.
I worried that maybe some channeling keep happening, since the flow always keep increasing through the shot, and stabilize at 1.7-2g/s. But I saw no holes in the puck after the shot, and saw no sputtering jet for most of the shots.

I now only expect to get an acceptable dark roast espresso with no sourness and astringency. Even an overly bitter one will be good.

Please help me! Thank you!

(I do pour over for 5 years and can get good coffee easily for all roast levels. So I think my sense of flavor is reliable.)",2,1751482722.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I am a 26 year old guy and when I have like a ""crush"" on a girl I get really depressed. It is like void that I fall in deeper and deeper to the point I just panic and I don't enjoy life anymore. 

At the moment it's that again. I really have a big crush on a girl I basicaly only know from instagram interactions. Over the past weeks/months I slowly started to get more into her. And now I literally hit rock bottom. The worst part is that she even has a boyfriend. I cannot even ask her for like a coffee to be over it. I am tired, I lost all purpose in life, I don't enjoy hobby's anymore and I isolated myself from my friends. I cannot concentrate on my job anymore. I feel absolutely terrible and tired. She will never be my girlfriend and she is living her best life wirh her friende and her bf and I am laying completely drained and hopeless on my cough. 

I also had this exact same issue with a coworker. I also really started to like her. Difference is that I knew her from real life. She also had a bf and I couldn't get over it. 

And in the past more of these ""crushes""  

I mean I get emotionally invested into this so quickly. I think one of the issues is that the feeling is never mutual. Not a single girl ever liked me romantically. It hurts being 26 and alone and never been loved by a girl. I honestly doubt if it is ever gonna happen. And it is my big anxiety. I don't want to be alone forever, I also want a family and someone to love. 

How can it be not a single girl on this planet had ever fell in love with me? Or showed romantic interst in me? ",4,1751482501.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1lq41jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greyhounds/comments/1lq41jo/would_you_let_us_adopt_a_greyhound_heres_my_pitch/,Would you let us adopt a greyhound? Here's my pitch.,"Hi all,

  
My partner and I are looking to adopt a greyhound. We are super excited, but I'm wondering how difficult it is to qualify for an adoption? The rescue we're working with seems hesitant to work with us and I'm questioning why. This will be a bit of a long post, so thanks if you read until the end. :) 

  
We're based in the US where it seems greyhounds are less common here than in Australia or the UK. I've been volunteering with a local greyhound rescue for a couple of weeks to get some hands-on experience, and we just submitted our adoption application last week. We had someone come out to our apartment for a home visit last Saturday...and she was less than enthusiastic about our chances of qualifying for an adoption.

**So here's my pitch - would you adopt out a greyhound to us?**

* My partner and I are late 20s and live in a 1200 sq ft apartment on the 7th floor. However, it's spacious with lots of large windows to watch outside activity.
* We're only steps from a large pedestrian-only walking path by the water for daily exercise and potty breaks. 
* We don't have any other pets/kids and both work from home. 
* I'm on a break from work which means I'll have plenty of time over the next few months to devote to helping our dog settle into her new environment. 
* I also go to my parent's house 3-4 times each week, and they have a large, fully-fenced yard without other dogs, cats or small children (this would be our private dog park essentially). 

  
Backing up a bit, I've been in love with the greyhound breed for the past five years. I've even had a name picked out this entire time, and we talk about our 'hypothetical dog' often. My partner has had dogs his entire life until recently; however, I'm a first time dog owner as an adult. We haven't had a lifestyle that would easily accommodate a dog until recently. Meaning I felt we shouldn't adopt a dog until it would fit into our lifestyle without major changes (i.e., we'd risk the dog's happiness if we couldn't fully commit to proper and consistent care). I turn 30 in a few days and my friends are starting to have kids. We stay home on weekends more often now and are slowing down in terms of spontaneous social outings and general busy-ness. I finally feel ready to welcome a dog into our home and give it the training/enrichment/exercise it deserves. 

In preparation for adoption, I've spent the past 3 months reading books and watching videos about greyhounds and dogs in general. Things like how to train (FF of course), how to read a dog's body language and respect their boundaries, and like literally everything you should know before adopting a dog or greyhound specifically. And yes, I have a copy of Cynthia Branigan's book on my coffee table now as I type. My partner is on board with all of this as well.

**The problem?** Our adoption representative didn't ask us a single thing about our plans or preparation when she came to visit. I tried to slip in some nuggets about our prep, but it didn't' seem to register and I felt talked over the entire time. She just assumed that because we hadn't had a greyhound before that we had no idea about the dogs. I've literally talked to her while volunteering at the rescue several times. 

She was hung up on the fact that we'd have to take a dog out 3-4 times a day for potty breaks, which I was fully aware of obviously and this was a big part of my hesitation to get a dog in the past. But I'm prepared for the commitment now. She was concerned about how sensitive greyhounds are and how they're so nervous that living in an apartment setting could result in mishandling and reactive behaviors.

**The result?** She put our application on hold and told us to continue volunteering. I'm happy to do that - we've waited years, so a couple more weeks/months isn't that big of a deal. But I don't want to invest a ton of time or hope into something that's ultimately going nowhere. 

  
**What's your conclusion?** 

* Would you let us adopt a greyhound?
* Are greyhound NOT good apartment dogs (I know dogs are individuals, but in general)?
* Are greyhounds so sensitive that an elevator would be a disqualifier?
* Are breed-specific rescues just hard to work with, and do they make it hard qualify for adoption?
* Should I just trust the process and assume they know more than I do about our eligibility?
* Should I try to work with another greyhound adoption org in our area instead? I feel bad jumping around, especially after making a commitment to volunteer. One I plan to continue even after adoption.

I'm been so sad about our adoption prospects this week, but I want to be realistic. I don't want to end up with a reactive or unhappy dog in the long run. Give me your brutal honesty, and thanks if you read my entire rant! ",4,1751482311.0,Greyhounds,19,0.83,False

21F Diagnosed with ibs c in April, from constipation up to 5 days, at which point I would take bisacodyl 5mg to remove whatever was in me. 
It worked, but I was stuck in a cycle of laxative use, and the build up resulted in terrible bloating and smelling gas. 
Stopped this, the gp prescribed a fecal disimpaction regime. Completing this I felt no better. 
Looked into bowel retraining and now I can go almost everyday. I eat prunes daily (which bloat me and cause sharp pains) and sometimes take 60mg Mgcitrate before bed which works but I'm so scared of dependency. 
Can never go normally in the morning, it's either near diarrhoea from the prunes and laxatives, or type 4-5 pencil thin stools. I can't remember what fully emptying feels like. It takes 3 or 4 movements to empty too, or if I miss that morning window the rest of the day I know I'm in for pain and bloating amd belching.
Everyday I wake up in fear that I'll spend the day in agony and bloat with this constant urge to go but with no success. The pain is localised to my lower left abdomen, though more descending colon than Sigmoid. I rarely get the urge to go and when I do I never fully empty, even with laxatives. So much of my bowel movement is type 6 pieces the size of jelly beans that are so difficult to pass and with mucus. 
The pain is the worst - like a spasming pain or like there's a bubble sitting there waiting to burst. 
Passing gas is hard and rare, belching is constant. 
I feel like nothing moves and the pain drives me mad. 
I've tried increasing pysllium husk, but I could visibly see the bowel movement struggling through my body, and that was only expelled with laxatives. I eat roughly 20-25g fibre and no ultraprocessed foods. I rarely eat bread and every other meal is full of vegetables and dairy is rare for me. 
I take vsl fibre too, maybe this has helped me go every day?
Coffee helps to expel as much as I can, but it makes me so nauseous and bloated, there must be a better way. I'm also scared of dependency as I said before. 
Peppermint capsules and tea and mebeverine help the spasms, but mebeverine made me physically sick, so I drink tea when I can. 
Fennel seeds seem to help? 
I'm active, ~8000 steps a day plus abdominal massages and yoga and running. 
I'm doing nerva for my stress, but so much more less stressed these days and still have problems. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Part of me thinks that ibs c is such a lazy Diagnosis. It's hard for me to accept that there isn't something going on that needs a treatment or cure. I thought ibs was associated with periods of remission but this is endless. I've been suffering for years now and any help would be so valuable.

I wanted to share my story about getting¬†[veneers in Dubai](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/dubai-veneers-2/). I couldn't find real, honest experiences online. So, here's what I wish I knew before getting veneers.

# Why I Decided to Get Veneers

I never had the worst teeth, but I wasn't proud of them. They were a bit discolored, had small gaps, and uneven edges. This made me hide my smile often.

In Dubai, cosmetic dentistry is big. You see ads everywhere. Getting veneers was something I thought about, but I wasn't sure.

I had big questions:

* Will it look fake?
* Does the procedure hurt?
* Is it permanent?
* Will it be worth the cost?

# The Research Phase

I spent weeks researching veneers. Dubai has many clinics offering them. From fancy ones in Jumeirah to smaller ones in Al Barsha or Deira.

I visited four clinics for consultations. Here's what I learned:

* A clinic's smile gallery is key. I asked for real before-and-after photos. This showed me the dentist's style.
* Some clinics were too pushy. I liked the ones that listened and didn't rush me.
* There are different types of veneers. Porcelain is durable and natural-looking but expensive. Composite is cheaper but stains easily.

I chose a clinic in Business Bay. It was mid-range but had great reviews. The dentist made me feel at ease from the start.

# The Veneer Process

The whole process took two and a half weeks. Here's what it was like:

**Consultation and Smile Preview**  
The first visit was for planning. The dentist took scans and photos. They showed me what my smile could look like. Seeing this made me confident.

**Tooth Preparation**  
To fit the veneers, a thin layer of enamel was removed. It was painless thanks to local anesthesia. It took about 30 minutes.

**Temporary Veneers**  
I wore temporary veneers while waiting for the permanent ones. They were fragile but helped me get used to the new shape.

**Final Veneers Application**  
After 10 days, my permanent veneers were ready. The dentist bonded them in place. It took just under two hours. When I saw myself, I was speechless. I looked refined and more confident.

# Life After Veneers

It‚Äôs been a few months since I got veneers, and they‚Äôve changed my life more than I thought. Here‚Äôs how:

I smile more now. Not just in photos, but in everyday life too. I‚Äôm no longer shy about showing my teeth.

They feel like my own teeth. After getting used to them, I forgot they were veneers. I eat, speak, and brush them like my regular teeth.

People notice my smile. Friends and coworkers often compliment me, but in a subtle way. They might say I look fresh or my teeth are whiter. But no one guesses I got veneers, which is what I wanted.

# Things I Wish I Knew Before

Veneers are a big decision. While I‚Äôm happy with mine, here are some things I wish I knew before:

Veneers are not reversible. Once your enamel is filed down, you‚Äôll always need some covering on those teeth. This means you‚Äôll need replacements later.

Not every clinic is right for you. Some focus on making money, not on individual care. You want a clinic that takes time to understand your needs.

There‚Äôs a short adjustment period. My bite felt off for a few days, and I had a slight lisp. But these issues went away quickly.

They require maintenance. I‚Äôve cut back on coffee and wine and am more careful with what I eat. I also use better dental hygiene products.

# Cost Breakdown

In Dubai, veneer prices vary a lot. Some clinics quoted AED 1,800 per tooth, while others said AED 3,000. I paid around AED 12,000 for six veneers. It was expensive, but it was worth it for my confidence.

# So, Should You Get Veneers in Dubai?

Only you can decide if veneers are right for you. If you‚Äôre self-conscious about your smile and want a lasting solution, veneers can change your life. Just make sure you:

* Do your research
* Visit multiple clinics
* Ask the right questions
* Know what to expect in the long term

Getting veneers wasn‚Äôt just about looks‚Äîit was emotional. I finally see a reflection that matches how I feel inside. And that‚Äôs priceless.

If you‚Äôre thinking about veneers in Dubai and have questions, ask me. I‚Äôm here to help from one person to another.

1lq3vj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1lq3vj2/feedback_on_my_fasting_plan/,Feedback on my fasting plan?,"I would like to do brief water fasts on a regular basis. I have three goals:

1. To keep it chill. I have to take corticosteroids long-term. They make a person hungry all the time. So I‚Äôd like to structure things in a way that minimizes cravings / hunger / food noise.

2. Weight loss.

3. Autophagy - primarily to reduce inflammation.

4. ETA: Just remembered a fourth goal with fasting in general: Maintain a healthy microbiome. I‚Äôve seen research suggesting our healthy bacteria start to die off in as little as 24 hours after we stop eating, and so I‚Äôd prefer to generally stay close to that as a maximum. 

So I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll fast 2 to 4 times per month - whenever it fits in well with my family‚Äôs schedule. I don‚Äôt want to frequently disrupt our time to eat together nor make my fasting something that anyone else in the household needs to plan around. If I can fit it in, great, if not, I‚Äôm not going to stress about it.

I‚Äôm thinking a 3 day process:

- Day 1: 3:1 ketogenic meals throughout the day. Description of what that ketogenic meal ratio means given here: https://www.epilepsy.com/treatment/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet. Starting in this way on day one seems to quell my appetite enough to make it noticeably easier to transition to liquids the next day. My resting metabolic rate is a measley 1450 calories and my TDEE is 1750. I usually end up eating around 1400 cal on this day.

- Day 2: Maintain 3:1 or 4:1 ratio with drinks and MTC oil. I‚Äôve been having coffee or tea using a protein drink as creamer and supplementing each cup with 10 mL or so of MTC oil to maintain the ketogenic ratio. I usually have two or three cuppas plus MTC oil over the course of the morning. I stop including the protein drink by mid morning and have one last swig of MTC oil around noon, and then transition to water and electrolytes only for the rest of day two. The MTC oil seems to both quell my appetite and accelerate how quickly I move into ketosis (aiming to get to at least 0.4 blood serum level). I usually end up eating around 700 cal on this day.

- Day 3: Continue with water and electrolytes. Possibly include black coffee and black or green tea if I need caffeine to suppress appetite. The ketogenic to MTC oil transition over the previous two days usually diminishes my appetite pretty thoroughly, and so I find that I don‚Äôt tend to be all that hungry on day three. As for the autophagy - most of the research I‚Äôve seen indicates autophagy efficiency peaks between 18 to 72 hours into a water fast. So my goal is simply to reach 18 hours from the last time I had MTC oil on day two. Since that‚Äôs usually around noon, that means I‚Äôm potentially ready to break fast from 6 AM onward on day three. If I‚Äôm not hungry and it feels easy to continue past 18 hours, that‚Äôs great and I‚Äôll do so, but I‚Äôm also perfectly content to end things at 18 hours. I‚Äôve usually found that it‚Äôs comfortable to go to 24 to 30 hours, and so I‚Äôm most likely to break fast around noon or 6 PM on day three. I don‚Äôt want to spend too many days eating differently than my family and so I do have a firm goal of breaking fast by dinner time on day three. I usually end up eating around 400 cal on this day.

So the idea is to get to at least 18 hours of autophagy - and to do so in a way that helps my appetite easily ramp down. As for weight loss, over the course of the three days there‚Äôs about a 2750 calorie deficit. That‚Äôs compared to about a 1500 cal deficit I would usually have over three days. That‚Äôs an increased deficit of 1250 calories, so if I do this three times a month, that‚Äôs one extra pound of weight loss. It‚Äôs not much, but hey, I‚Äôll happily take what I can get! All in all, it seems like doing the above allows me to meet all three goals.

What I‚Äôm most curious about is when and how I might start to notice a reduction in inflammation. In the case of trying to reduce chronic and long-term inflammation, I figure it might be more helpful to do brief bouts of autophagy on a frequent and regular basis then to do longer fasts more infrequently - I suspect incrementalism is the right approach here. But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll actually be able to notice a difference in how I feel. I also don‚Äôt know how to measure it objectively because my serum inflammation markers tend to jump all over the place in a way that seems quite random. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely clear trends will show up in future testing. Does anyone have anecdotes to share about how fasting reduced their inflammation? What that felt like? When you started to notice improvements?

If you have read through all of this, thank you!

i dont even know where to start but i had a major (hypo?) manic episode January through March, and ever since been slowly recovering again. i had really insane cognitive impairment but somehow managed to get to the end of the academic year (uni) by dropping everything except the bare minimum core courses (and not going back to work until after exams). 
i feel normal again now. i even worked for 3 weeks and that was great because once i get moving i can keep moving. 

but beyond that there is this lingering intense executive dysfunction? or i guess its that, idk? like honestly i can count the number of showers i have had in the past 4 months on 2 hands. 

im visiting my parents in their home country rn so not a lot of external pressure to do thing and i have zero Momentum. like getting up from bed to make a coffee in the kitchen is a win. just to not even drink the coffee afterall. 

im trying to stick to at least one walk a day because im telling myself its gonna jumpstart me lmao but it mostly turns into me sitting on a bench for a few hours. even my thoughts just kinda faze out. i can REACT to everything, if there is direct external pressure my thoughts and body unlock, but without it there is no action üò≠ i cant even watch YouTube videos. 

i do have an adhd diagnosis but i dont remember being such a useless piece of shit before this all started. but i dont have any other symptoms going on either, i think. does this ever happen to anyone else? is this part of bipolar, or something else altogether? 

i do have a therapist and she wants to ""set goals"" such as ""just doing the thing im not doing"" but if i could just do it i would? lmao ",5,1751481818.0,bipolar2,2,0.86,False

I'm from the Balkans and here every free moment that people have is spent outside in coffee shops or low-budget restaurants called ""kafana"".

And the thing that annoys me the most is the scheduling part. In USA if you wanna meet someone you text them and schedule ahead in days or maybe weeks. Here they call you (rarely text you) and they expect to go out with them almost immediately (30min - 2hrs). Also going out for a coffee here is never 30mins/1hr instead you sit in a coffee shop for 2hrs and talking bullshit. Going to a ""kafana"" is worse. Its never just a lunch or a dinner its 5/6hrs eating. Oh i forgot to mentiot that ""lets go grab a coffee"" here means drinking alchocol.

What I did:
I wanted to limit people from calling me and insist of going somewhere so i built a system where if someone called me and i am busy (i have scheduled event in my calendar. i schedule everything tho) the system will reject the call (without even ringing) and send them the message to call me back later and will provide a link where they can schedule a coffee to drink. I also included an exception for my family and emergency calls (basically everyone that sent me an sms with text 'emergency' could call me.

And guess what, every coleague from colleage, every friend started to send me emergency sms and then call me to go on a coffee.

I dont know any more what to do further and how to solve my problem. Basically of you are not from here you wont understand me and you will probably be just laughing right now but i cant just say NO to them. Basically everyone are the same here.",3,1751481559.0,selfimprovement,2,0.8,False

1lq3m7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lq3m7l/does_the_haden_12cup_drip_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the HADEN 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker Deliver Quality? Comprehensive Review,"Testing the Haden CORECOFFEE Drip Coffee Maker has genuinely proved to be an interesting experience. From the outset, I couldn‚Äôt help but appreciate its retro charm. The blend of a classic design with a matte putty color gives it an aesthetic that fits seamlessly into both modern and traditional kitchens. While aesthetics are a nice bonus, functionality remains the top priority. This coffee machine isn‚Äôt just about looks‚Äîit boasts a fully programmable system and numerous user-friendly features that elevate it beyond just a basic addition to your counter.

**Key Positives**

- The 12-cup capacity makes it ideal for households with multiple coffee drinkers or for hosting guests.  
- Its programmable clock and delay brew settings are lifesavers on those busy mornings when I need my coffee ready as soon as I‚Äôm out of bed.  
- The reusable washable filter not only saves money on disposable filters but also cuts down on waste.  
- The Auto Shut-Off feature after 120 minutes is a thoughtful touch, especially for people like me who are often too distracted to remember to turn appliances off.  

[Check HADEN CORECOFFEE price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08fst5667/)

**Aesthetic and Build Quality**

The retro-inspired design of this coffee maker is incredibly charming. It doesn‚Äôt merely sit on the countertop as a functional machine but elevates the kitchen‚Äôs decor with its sleek details and stylish hue. Despite its lightweight build (only 3.8 pounds), it feels sturdy and well-made. However, I did notice it‚Äôs a bit taller than I expected, standing at 13.5 inches, which means it‚Äôs not the most compact option if you have limited counter-to-cabinet space.

**Functionality and Ease of Use**

Operating this coffee maker feels intuitive. All the buttons are self-explanatory, which is a relief after dealing with overly complicated interfaces in other appliances. My family and I particularly appreciated the Brew Strength button, especially on days when stronger coffee was a must. Additionally, the 30-Second Anti-Drip function prevents messes, which is perfect for impatient coffee lovers like my partner, who tends to grab a cup mid-brew.

**Drawbacks**

- Taller design might not fit seamlessly under shorter cabinets, so make sure to measure your space.  
- While the machine functions efficiently, the water reservoir can be a bit tedious to fill, as the opening isn‚Äôt the widest.  
- Although the matte exterior resists smudges, tiny coffee spills stick to it surprisingly easily, which means cleaning requires regular attention.  

**Energy Efficiency and Safety**

The Auto Shut-Off feature is genuinely one of my favorite aspects. Knowing that it powers down after 120 minutes when I forget (which I often do) is comforting. Additionally, from a cost-effective standpoint, the reusable filter eliminates the constant need for paper filters, cutting down on both expenses and waste. The machine is also relatively quiet during operation, an underrated feature in a household where everyone values their early morning tranquility.

**Peer Products**

Compared to similar models like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew or Mr. Coffee‚Äôs 12-Cup Coffee Maker, the Haden CORECOFFEE feels uniquely positioned. It surpasses Mr. Coffee in build quality and design with its retro charm but falls slightly behind the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew's dual-functionality feature, which allows for making both single cups and carafes. That said, the delay timer and reusable filter give Haden a slight edge over its competitors in terms of convenience and eco-friendliness.

**Smart Spending**

Despite sitting in the mid-range price category, this drip coffee maker delivers features that feel like great value for its cost. Its programmable functions, stylish look, and reliable performance ensure that you‚Äôre not overpaying for features you don‚Äôt need. For those seeking both aesthetics and practicality, this product will fit right in. If you want beauty, functionality, and reliability rolled into one machine, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong here.

I hope you enjoy and I‚Äôm open to any criticism in the comments. Thanks! 




I wasn‚Äôt always like this.
Back then, I drank black coffee. Counted receipts. Listened to static in my talk-radio mornings. Kept my uniform pressed; iron lines, perfect creases. Kept my head sharper than most around me. I filed everything alphabetically: reports, case folders, even receipts from lunch. The life of a small‚Äëtown policeman: dependable, repetitive, clean.
That changed the night I found Emory Baines.

1. The Call
It came in just before midnight.
‚ÄúWelfare check. Old Baines out by Danvers Road. No sign of traffic, no porch lights, mail piling up.‚Äù
I wanted to say no, it was routine, someone else‚Äôs beat, but I said yes. I had that night off. Felt I needed to burn off the restlessness.
The farmhouse stood quiet under a low moon. The yard was still. No wind. No animals moving. Just the creak of a porch swing, turning on its chain. Slowly.
The door was unlocked. I called out. No answer. Only the smell: wet iron and rot. Inside, the hallway was dark and crumbling‚Äîpeeling wallpaper curling at the edges.
I found him in the back room.

2. The Body
Emory was exactly six inches off the floor. Suspended; not by anything solid, but by intention. His neck was cranked, head angled oddly. Mouth half‚Äëopen. Eyes glazed in quiet disbelief.
No rope. No beam. Nothing but the air holding him.
The floor beneath was scorched, a spiral, burned black and still faintly smoldering.
A voice whispered at the back of my skull as I stared.
Look away.
Look away.
But I couldn‚Äôt.
When I left, they wrote it off as suicide. Heart failure. Delusional ideation. Fine by me.
I told them I agreed.

3. The Spiral Awakens
I didn‚Äôt sleep that week. I couldn‚Äôt. I saw that spiral in every dark corner, on the station floor, in the kitchen linoleum, on the stack of files I worked through at night.
At home, I started numbering the cases in my head.
1952: farmhand, no rope, suspended in thin air.
1968: soldier in Alabama, spiral etched across his chest postmortem.
1983: girl in Gravesend; walls burned with spirals; she lived.
I cataloged them all. Pulled books from the library. Arcane texts, biblical margins, handwritten notes. Found a line scribbled beneath a page on exorcism:
""To speak to the unseen, speak in circles. Burn cedar. Use rope. Use blood.""
I copied it by hand. Underlined it.
That night, I slept with the book under my pillow.

4. The First Rite
It was January. Cold enough to frost my breath inside the apartment.
I taped a chalk spiral on the floor, three feet across, perfect arcs.
In the center: a rope knot, burned at the ends.
I lit cedar incense and watched the smoke curl as if it wanted to spell a name.
I pricked my thumb on the rope, let the blood bead into the knot.
I spoke the words.
Heart thudding. Air thick. I swear I heard a low hum, like the earth‚Äôs heartbeat, pulsing in my ears.
Then‚Äîblack.
When I came to, I was in a field. No moon. No stars. My breath was a plume. My mouth tasted of blood and ash. I walked until I found a crossroads road, flagged down a faint car light.
My phone said three days had passed. 

The Baines property sat at the edge of the county line, out past the barley fields where the land got flat and strange. No lights in the windows. No tire tracks in the dirt. Just the house slouching in the dark like something too tired to keep pretending it wasn‚Äôt dead.
I parked by the fence and walked the rest of the way.
The front porch groaned under my boots. Wind chattered through the gutters, rattling something metallic‚Äîmaybe an old horseshoe nailed above the door for luck. It hadn‚Äôt helped.
I knocked once, then again. No answer.
Dispatch had logged the welfare call an hour ago. Neighbor said she hadn‚Äôt seen Emory in days. Mail was piling up. Porch light out. Dog barking at the house every night for three nights straight, like something inside it offended the animal‚Äôs sense of the natural.
I tried the handle.
Unlocked.
The door creaked open slow, like it resented being disturbed.
The smell hit me first; sweet rot, chemical undertone, and something else, faint and metallic, like old coins soaked in rainwater. I stepped into the hallway. Dust thick on the floor, the kind that gathers when no one moves through a place for a while.
The house wasn‚Äôt just empty.
It felt abandoned by more than people.
I called his name once. ""Mr. Baines?""
No reply. Just the slow tick of a wall clock and the faint groan of the floorboards under my weight.
I found him in the back room.
It was Emory, alright. Eyes open. Mouth slack.
Six inches off the ground.
No rope. No support beam. No stool beneath him. Just‚Ä¶ hanging. Suspended in the air like someone had told gravity to take a break.
His arms hung limp. His fingers were curled inwards, like they‚Äôd clawed at something just before the end. His neck tilted at an impossible angle‚Äîhead cocked to the side in a way that suggested either a violent twist‚Ä¶ or a gentle one made by something that didn‚Äôt need effort.
I didn‚Äôt move at first. Didn‚Äôt breathe. Just stared.
Then I saw the floor beneath him.
Burned into the old pine boards was a spiral, a wide, dark coil about five feet across. The wood was scorched black but not charred. No fire damage anywhere else in the room. Just this mark. It pulsed faintly at the edges, like the embers had been smothered only minutes ago.
I stepped closer. The air near the spiral felt different.
Denser. Pressurized. Like being underwater. A soft hum crawled up my legs, into my gut, behind my eyes. Every hair on my body stood up like I was near a live wire.
Then something‚Äîsoft‚Äîmoved at the edge of my hearing.
Not words. Not quite.
Just a sound like breath on the back of my neck.
And in that breath, a whisper:
‚ÄúThree turns. One knot. No light.‚Äù
My vision blurred. I stumbled back, heart punching against my ribs. I wiped my face and my hand came away damp with sweat. I called it in.
Said it looked like suicide.
Said there was a rope. That it had broken. That Emory had hanged himself in the attic and fallen through a rotten ceiling beam. I used the words they expected.
I didn't mention the spiral.
Didn‚Äôt mention the voice.
Didn‚Äôt mention the feeling in the air that made my teeth ache.
The coroner ruled it cardiac arrest. They boxed Emory up, bagged and tagged his effects, and cleared the scene by morning.
But the spiral stayed with me. Burned into my memory.
That night, in the quiet hum of my apartment, I dreamed of rope and ash and voices like cracked bone.
And when I woke, I had drawn something on the wall while I slept.
A spiral. Three turns. One knot. No light.
 
I told myself it was just a fluke.

Stress. Fatigue. Some buried trauma finally rising up from the quiet parts of my mind. That‚Äôs what I told myself. But deep down, in that pocket of the soul where your logic can‚Äôt reach, I knew it wasn‚Äôt that.

There was a moment when I could‚Äôve stopped. Could‚Äôve put the report in the archive, shut the file, and gone home. Had a drink. Slept it off. Moved on. But I didn‚Äôt. 
Instead, I started digging.
I pulled the Baines file again the next night. Flipped through it. Nothing jumped out‚Äîjust the spiral, burned into the floor and deliberately omitted from the official report. I had taken a photo on my phone before the coroner arrived. Just one. I opened it in the dark and stared at it until the screen dimmed itself out.
That‚Äôs when the idea hit me.
What if it wasn‚Äôt the first time?
I started with our own cold cases. Anything strange. Anything involving hanging or symbols. It didn‚Äôt take long.

Rosedale. Unsolved case: a woman found ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù in her barn. No ligature. No physical wounds. The file said ‚Äúdeath by misadventure.‚Äù
Gravesend. Girl found carving spirals into her walls after waking from a week-long fugue. She‚Äôd survived a ‚Äúsuicide attempt,‚Äù but no one ever found a rope. The floorboards had black scorch marks.
Every ten, maybe fifteen years.
Always rural. Always secluded. Always someone who lived alone. 

The spiral showed up again and again. Sometimes scratched into glass. Sometimes burned into stone. Sometimes not seen at all‚Äîbut described the same way: three turns. One center. Like it had always existed under the floorboards, waiting to be uncovered.
I expanded my search. Local papers. Online forums. Occult message boards buried in corners of the web where the moderators had names like VesselSeer and KnotMother.
That‚Äôs when I found the nickname.
The Whispering Noose.
Urban legend, they said. A rope that appears in your dreams before it appears in your room. A spiral that marks you before you see it. A death that doesn‚Äôt need a hand to pull the knot tight.
Most people treated it like a joke.
But some posts‚Ä¶ weren‚Äôt joking.
‚ÄúHeard the hum in the walls. Then the attic went cold.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe saw the spiral in her tea. Two days later, she was gone.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt burns inward. Like a knot being tied around the soul.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sleep near rope. Don‚Äôt dream in circles. It listens.‚Äù
I printed everything I could. Highlighted patterns. Started taping them to the wall in my spare room.
The girl in Gravesend? Her name came up in one of the posts. A user claimed she still lived, under psychiatric care, unable to speak but still drawing spirals into her blankets, over and over, even thirty years later. 
Her doctor had been a folklorist before going into medicine. She had published a short paper on ‚Äúrepeating trauma iconography in uncontacted religious manifestations.‚Äù I found the journal. Read it three times. Took notes.
She mentioned a phrase I‚Äôd never seen before:
‚ÄúThe language beneath language.‚Äù
That phrase stuck with me. Turned over in my head like a stone in a river. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Didn‚Äôt go in to work. Told them I was sick. Which wasn‚Äôt far off.
I started forgetting what day it was. I‚Äôd open the blinds and find night when I expected dawn. My phone buzzed with missed calls I didn‚Äôt remember ignoring. Sometimes I‚Äôd find myself standing in the center of my living room, hand raised like I‚Äôd been holding something, but it was gone.
I didn‚Äôt eat much. Coffee. Toast. Whatever was within arm‚Äôs reach.
My walls filled up. Spirals, rope diagrams, burnt floorboards. A quote from a book I couldn‚Äôt remember reading:
‚ÄúThe spiral is not a shape. It is a direction.‚Äù
I found old police records from other counties. Officers who‚Äôd gone missing. One had written ‚Äúcircles open what doors cannot‚Äù in his case notes, just two days before his cruiser was found empty outside a burned-down church.
That was when I noticed something strange.
A name repeated across three of the coldest cases:
E. Croft.
Sometimes listed as a witness. Sometimes a relative. Always peripheral. Always present. Never questioned.
Emory Baines had written that name in the margin of a ledger, two weeks before he died.
I pulled that photo up again‚Äîthe one of the spiral on his floor.
This time, I zoomed in close.
Near the center of the spiral, almost too faint to see, were three small symbols.
One looked like a noose.
One looked like an eye.
And one looked like a door. Cracked open.
My heart pounded.
The spiral wasn‚Äôt just a shape.
It was a map.
And I had just started reading it.

It started with rope.
Not the evidence-bag kind. Not the kind from a gallows or a barn beam. Just... rope. Old, frayed, twisted. I found it at a flea market booth next to a rusted box of Civil War buttons and a stack of yellowing postcards. The woman behind the table didn‚Äôt even look up when I handed her cash.
It smelled like cedar and mildew.
Like it had been waiting.
I took it home and set it on the table. For hours I just stared at it, daring myself to touch it. When I finally did, the fibers felt warm. Not just from sunlight. Warm like breath.
That night, I cleared the floor of my apartment. Pushed aside the couch, rolled up the rug, turned off the lights.
I‚Äôd found instructions scrawled in a journal attributed to some French missionary who disappeared in the Congo in 1799. They weren‚Äôt complete. Just fragments. Like someone had written them in a fever:
‚ÄúSpiral must be drawn inward-facing.‚Äù
‚ÄúBurn cedar ‚Äî not pine, not ash.‚Äù
‚ÄúBlood. Yours, not another‚Äôs. A gift freely given.‚Äù
‚ÄúSpeak not to the noose, but through it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThree breaths. Three turns. Seal your eyes. Let it listen.‚Äù
I followed it as best I could.
The spiral I drew was shaky. Chalk on wood, curling inward like a snake ready to devour its own tail. I placed the rope at the center, coiled loosely, ends singed from a lighter. I lit a cedar stick and watched the smoke curl like fingers, thin and searching.
My hands trembled as I pricked my thumb and let the blood drip onto the knot. Just a few drops. Red against the brown fibers. It sank in quickly, like it belonged there.
I knelt inside the spiral. Took three deep breaths.
Then I spoke.
The words weren‚Äôt mine. Not really. I‚Äôd memorized phonetic fragments from the journal‚Äîsyllables that didn‚Äôt belong in any language I knew. They felt wrong in my mouth, like I was chewing glass.
The moment I finished the last phrase, the temperature dropped.
Instantly.
Not gradually, not metaphorically‚Äîlike the air had been sucked out of the room. My lungs burned. My ears rang. The spiral on the floor pulsed, faintly glowing, as though the chalk had become veins filled with dull red light.
I felt... watched.
No
Measured.
My skin crawled. My scalp tightened. There was a pressure behind my eyes, building‚Äî
And then‚Äì
I blinked.
And the room was gone.
I was standing in a field.
Wide, flat, and utterly still. No stars. No moon. Just an endless gray-black sky like wet stone. The earth beneath my feet was damp and spongy, like it hadn‚Äôt felt sun in centuries.
Rows of gallows stretched into the distance‚Äîdozens of them, maybe hundreds. No ropes hung from the beams. Just shadows. Hanging, swinging.
No wind. No sound.
I turned in a slow circle, heart hammering so loud I could hear it in my teeth. There were figures nearby, half-seen in the gloom. Not people. Shapes. Like silhouettes carved from smoke and held together by want.
They twitched when I looked at them. Not toward me‚Äîaway. Like they were bowing. Like they recognized me.
My knees buckled. I dropped into the wet dirt.
The spiral was beneath me, not drawn, not etched‚Äîgrown into the grass itself. The rope sat at the center again. It pulsed, just once.
And then everything‚Äî
snapped.
I woke up in someone‚Äôs field.
Face-down in frozen mud. Mouth full of blood. No shoes.
I sat up slowly. My muscles didn‚Äôt want to work right. Like they‚Äôd been... re-threaded. 
The sun was rising. Pale and thin.
I was ten miles from my apartment.
I had no idea how I got there.
When I finally made it home‚Äîlimping, shaking, clutching the rope like it was a piece of my spine‚ÄîI checked my phone.
Three days had passed.
I‚Äôd missed calls from the department. My neighbor. My landlord. All timestamped. All real.
There was a text I didn‚Äôt remember sending to a number I didn‚Äôt recognize. No words. Just a spiral emoji. Sent at 3:33 AM on a day I hadn‚Äôt known existed until now.
That night, when I peeled off my shirt, I found something burned into the skin of my chest.
Not a brand.
A symbol.
Faint. Red. Still warm to the touch.
A noose.
Three loops.
Tied backward.
I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.
I sat on the floor. 
And I listened.
Because somewhere just behind the drywall, the rope began to whisper back. 

After the first blackout, I told myself I was done.
I threw the rope into a drainage canal behind the apartment complex. Poured bleach over the spiral. Washed the blood from the floorboards. Lit sage I didn‚Äôt believe in and left every light in the place burning.
But that night, the shadows pulsed anyway.
The whispering didn‚Äôt stop. It just‚Ä¶ got smarter.
It no longer came from the walls. It came from places I shouldn‚Äôt have been: my voicemail. The hum of the fridge. A record I hadn‚Äôt played in years that began to spin by itself, backwards, slow, singing breathy syllables in the old tongue.
The symbol on my chest blistered.
It peeled, then reformed.
Like it was alive.
Like it wasn‚Äôt done.
I tried to work. I did. Put the badge back on. Poured myself coffee and read the morning reports. But every third word looked like rope. Paper left spiral burns on my hands. And once, when I touched a file on an unrelated robbery case, it whispered Emory Baines‚Äôs name.
I took unpaid leave the next day.
I told the chief I was dealing with a ‚Äústress-induced neurological event.‚Äù
That part was true.
The rest of it would‚Äôve gotten me committed.
Instead of resting, I went deeper.
I drove to Ashmont. Found the same library where I‚Äôd seen the theological marginalia. Talked my way into the stacks. Pulled books that hadn‚Äôt been checked out since the 40s. Behind the reference section, I found a hand-stitched volume, no title on the spine, tucked between two Civil War memoirs.
It reeked of copper.
Inside: spiral after spiral after spiral. Each one slightly different. Not artistic variations‚Äîfunctional ones.
One labeled ‚Äúbinding.‚Äù
One labeled ‚Äúcalling.‚Äù
One that took up two whole pages, ringed in symbols I‚Äôd seen only in dreams.
No caption. Just a title, scrawled in a hand that shook:
‚ÄúThe Mouth Below the Tree.‚Äù
That same symbol showed up in a 1911 s√©ance record I found in a box of ephemera at a curio shop. A medium in Alabama. Her eyes had been burned shut. Literally scorched closed, skin fused, no evidence of fire elsewhere in the room. She‚Äôd drawn the same spiral in her own blood the day before she died.
I memorized it.
Copied it. Drew it again and again.
It showed up on the mirror one morning, already there in the steam before I even showered.
That was the first time I felt the world slip.
It happened like this:
One second, I was drinking coffee at the diner near 8th and Wilbur.
The next, I was in a barn I‚Äôd never seen before. Smelled like mold and iron.
Rope dangling from every rafter.
My hands were cut.
My lips were bleeding.
There was chalk dust under my nails and a spiral carved into my arm‚Äînot drawn, carved‚Äîso clean it looked surgical.
And in the rafters above me?
Footsteps.
Slow. Measured. Like something with weight was walking on wood that shouldn‚Äôt support it.
I ran.
Woke up on the side of the highway.
Covered in blood. Not all of it mine.
The blackouts got worse.
I started losing days instead of hours.
Woke up in motel rooms I hadn‚Äôt paid for, with receipts in my pocket and hand-scrawled notes reading:
‚ÄúThe gate wants more.‚Äù
‚ÄúKnots form where names forget themselves.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a curse. It‚Äôs an inheritance.‚Äù
One night, I came to in the middle of a ritual.
Candles lit.
Spiral drawn.
A mirror set in the center, and in the reflection?
A room that wasn‚Äôt mine.
It looked like an old chapel. Black wood. Rope instead of pews. No ceiling. Just sky that throbbed red and raw like a wound.
I turned away.
My reflection didn‚Äôt. 
My body started breaking.
Nosebleeds that wouldn‚Äôt stop. Tremors. Weight loss. Teeth grinding until I cracked a molar.
One day I coughed into the sink and spat up twine.
Twine.
Still damp, knotted, coiled like it had been in my throat for hours.
I went to the ER. 
They found nothing wrong. No damage. No twine. Just iron-deficiency anemia and a look from the attending like I‚Äôd wasted her time.
But I knew what I‚Äôd felt.
The noose wasn‚Äôt around my neck. It was inside me.
Knotted around my organs. Threading itself into my nerves.
It had crawled in through the spiral.
It was building a home.
That‚Äôs when I started hearing about others.
Not from online.
From here.
A deputy in Tolton County who saw the rope in her dreams, then went catatonic.
A hunter who found a ‚Äúhanging tree‚Äù where there shouldn‚Äôt have been one‚Äîand came back with his pupils spiral-shaped.
A therapist in Gravesend who dreamed of rope, then drowned herself in a dry bathtub.
I wasn‚Äôt alone.
And that terrified me more than anything.
Because if it could spread‚Ä¶
If it could pass from person to person, like an infection?
Then what the hell had I opened?


The spiral wanted permanence. That much was clear.
Every blackout pulled me deeper. Every mark on my body was a thread sewn tighter. Every dream gave it more shape, more voice, more space in my mind.
I wasn‚Äôt losing time anymore.
Time was losing me.
The journals I‚Äôd found‚Äîthe French missionary, the s√©ance transcripts, the Gravesend case notes‚Äîthey all pointed to the same thing:
Severance was possible.
But only once.
And only if done in the right place.
I traced the stories backward‚Äîincidents of whispering rope, spontaneous hangings, vanished bodies. Most of them happened in proximity to something buried. An origin point. A wound in the ground. One name kept repeating:
Harrow‚Äôs Field.
I found it on an old county map, about thirty miles from the Baines case, listed as ‚Äúchurch ruins.‚Äù A chapel burned in 1939. Locals never rebuilt it. No one even paved the road leading to it. It had been swallowed by the woods and forgotten.
Except by the spiral.
I packed only what I needed.
Chalk. Salt. Rope ash I‚Äôd scraped from my floorboards. A silver bowl I‚Äôd bought from a psychic who wouldn‚Äôt look me in the eye. A rusted knife. And the notebook I‚Äôd copied the rite from‚Äîpages waterlogged and flaking, the ink run in long, teardrop shapes.
I drove out as a storm rolled in.
Of course it did.
The chapel wasn‚Äôt much more than a husk‚Äîjust a low perimeter of moss-covered stone and a broken archway framing what used to be the altar.
The air was wrong here.
Thicker. Stilled. Like sound didn‚Äôt know what to do with itself.
Trees leaned away from the clearing. Birds didn‚Äôt enter. Even the bugs were absent.
I stepped over the threshold.
Immediately, my vision blurred.
The spiral on my arm burned hot‚Äîglowed faintly through the fabric of my jacket. It knew I was here. It remembered this place.
I laid the tools out in a ring.
Iron dust to bind the perimeter. Rope ash in the center. A drop of blood on each of the four cardinal points. The silver bowl in the middle, filled with rainwater now thick with dirt and leaves.
Then I spoke.
Words that weren‚Äôt words.
Sounds pulled from old dreams.
Backwards breath.
The syllables of undoing.
The spiral responded.
It rose in the earth beneath me‚Äîfirst faint, then glowing. Not drawn this time, but carved into the bones of the land. It pulsed in time with my heartbeat.
And then I felt it:
Something waking.
Something inside the spiral.
Watching me from beneath the roots of the chapel.
Curious. Hungry.
I shouted the severance line, stabbing the knife down into the bowl.
The water boiled black.
The circle ignited.
And then‚Äî
The gate opened.
I wasn‚Äôt standing in the ruins anymore.
I was beneath them.
Not metaphorically.
Physically. Somehow. Inside a mirror version of the chapel. Upside-down rafters dripped with melted rope. The pews were lengths of bone lashed together by strands of braided hair. The altar was a slab of red stone, still wet.
And behind it‚Äî
A figure.
Not a man.
Not even a shadow.
A shape built from loops and knots and limbs that shouldn‚Äôt bend. Its face was a network of nooses, each one twitching. Inside every loop: an eye. All of them fixed on me.
‚ÄúYou seek to sever,‚Äù it said.
Its voice didn‚Äôt echo. It just happened in my skull.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve carried the rope. Spoken the breath. Worn the spiral like birthright.
And now you would cut it?‚Äù
I raised the knife.
My arms wouldn‚Äôt move.
The blade shook in my grip. My feet sank into the spiral beneath me, like the stone had turned to mud. My breath failed.
‚ÄúYou are the knot. There is no rope without tension.There is no door without you.‚Äù
It stepped forward. The spiral widened. My chest cracked. My eyes rolled back.
I saw visions again‚Äîof gallows stretching into the void.
Of trees strung with organs.
Of myself, swinging in a field of mirrors.
I screamed.
And through the scream‚ÄîI remembered.
The final line.
The one no one dared to speak.
The one written upside down at the bottom of the French missionary‚Äôs page, hidden beneath layers of wax.
‚ÄúBlood binds. Fire ends. But name seals.‚Äù
My voice broke as I shouted it‚Äî
‚ÄúI name thee unmade. I name thee untied.‚Äù
The world split.
Light tore through the chapel, a white fire eating everything. The figure let out a shriek‚Äînot sound, but sensation‚Äîlike my teeth trying to leave my skull.
The spiral snapped.
The gate folded in on itself.
I woke up in the dirt.
The silver bowl had melted. The salt had been blasted outward like shrapnel. My clothes were torn. My skin blistered across my back in spiral shapes that steamed even in the rain.
My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking.
I couldn‚Äôt speak.
My ears rang for hours.
But I was still alive.
And the rope?
Gone.
Turned to ash and scattered on the wind.
I crawled out of the chapel at dawn. The sun never looked so pale. My body was still marked. Still humming. Still tethered in ways I couldn‚Äôt see.
But the spiral was gone from my dreams, for now.
And for the first time in weeks, I didn‚Äôt hear it breathing behind the walls.
I had closed the gate.
But I hadn't killed what lived beyond it.
Only sent it back.
Only made it wait.

I‚Äôll be rolling into Pascagoula the evening of July 10th, riding in on my 1973 Honda CB175 from the Great Lakes region of Ohio. 
I‚Äôm attending a labor seminar in town from July 11th to the 13th and am looking for a safe, friendly place to crash during that window.

Open to options:
‚Äì A spare couch or room in someone‚Äôs home 

‚Äì An affordable BnB, inn, or motel that won‚Äôt break the bank

I travel light, clean up after myself, and know how to make a decent cup of coffee and meal if that sweetens the deal. Mostly I‚Äôll be out during the day, just need a place to sleep, shower, and recharge.

If you know anyone in the area, or have a lead on a low-cost stay, I‚Äôd be grateful. This trip is part of a bigger journey I‚Äôm documenting‚Äîabout the American road, union roots, and the people who keep the world turning. Would love to share a few stories if you‚Äôre up for it.

Thanks for reading and helping a working-class traveler out. ‚úä

Ride safe,
Brian

So, you've started your Zepbound journey - that's fantastic! You're likely already seeing some of the benefits, like a reduced appetite or perhaps a bit of weight loss. But here's the thing - while Zepbound is incredibly effective for many, it's not always a completely smooth ride. You might be wondering, ""Is this nausea normal?"" or ""Why am I suddenly so tired?""

Trust me, you're not alone. Experiencing some side effects is actually pretty common, especially when you're just getting started or when your dose increases. The good news? Most of these are manageable, and with a few smart strategies, you can often lessen their impact. This post is all about giving you the practical tips and tricks I've learned (and others have shared) to make your Zepbound experience as comfortable as possible. Let's dive in!

**Understanding What's Normal - And What's Not**

First things first, let's talk about expectations. Zepbound works by slowing down your digestion and affecting your hunger signals. Because of this, some digestive changes are almost par for the course. We're talking things like nausea, constipation, or sometimes diarrhea. Fatigue and headaches can also pop up.

These are often mild to moderate and tend to improve over time as your body adjusts. That said, it's super important to listen to your body. If you're experiencing severe pain, vomiting that won't stop, or any symptoms that worry you, don't hesitate. **Always reach out to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately** if something feels seriously off. They're your best resource for personalized advice.

**Tackling Nausea: Your Stomach's Best Friend**

Nausea is probably one of the most talked-about side effects, and for good reason - it's no fun! It often happens because Zepbound slows down gastric emptying. This means food stays in your stomach longer.

Here's what I've found can really help:

- **Eat smaller, more frequent meals.** Instead of three big meals, try five or six mini-meals throughout the day. This keeps your stomach from getting too full.
- **Stick to bland, easy-to-digest foods.** Think toast, crackers, rice, plain chicken, or broth. These are gentler on your stomach.
- **Avoid greasy, spicy, or overly sugary foods.** These can be much harder to digest and might make nausea worse.
- **Sip on clear liquids.** Water, ginger ale (flat is often better), or peppermint tea can be soothing. Don't gulp them down; small sips work best.
- **Don't lie down right after eating.** Give your body some time - at least 30 minutes to an hour - to start digesting before you recline.
- **Try ginger.** Ginger chews, ginger tea, or even just smelling fresh ginger can sometimes help calm a queasy stomach.

**Beating Digestive Woes: Constipation and Diarrhea**

It's a bit of a paradox, isn't it? Zepbound can cause both constipation *and* diarrhea in different people. The key is knowing which one you're dealing with and how to adjust.

**When Constipation Calls:**

If things are feeling a bit ""backed up,"" you're not alone. This is a very common side effect.

- **Fiber is your friend.** Gradually increase your intake of high-fiber foods. We're talking fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Just don't go overboard too quickly, or you might upset your stomach further.
- **Hydration, hydration, hydration.** I can't stress this enough! Water is crucial for keeping things moving. Aim for plenty of fluids throughout the day.
- **Move your body.** Even gentle exercise, like a daily walk, can stimulate your digestive system.
- **Listen to your body.** Don't ignore the urge to go. If you do, it can make constipation worse.

**When Diarrhea Strikes:**

On the flip side, some people experience loose stools. This can be just as disruptive.

- **Embrace the BRAT diet.** Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast are your go-to's here. They're binding and easy on your gut.
- **Stay super hydrated.** Diarrhea can lead to dehydration quickly. Drink plenty of water, clear broths, and electrolyte solutions.
- **Avoid trigger foods.** High-fat foods, dairy products, overly spicy dishes, and artificial sweeteners can often make diarrhea worse.

**Managing Fatigue and Headaches: Keeping Your Energy Up**

Feeling unusually tired or getting headaches can be really frustrating when you're trying to live your life. These are often linked to changes in your metabolism and hydration.

**For Fatigue:**

- **Prioritize sleep.** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. A consistent sleep schedule can make a huge difference.
- **Gentle movement helps.** While you might feel tired, a short walk or light stretching can sometimes boost your energy levels more than sitting still.
- **Fuel your body wisely.** Make sure you're eating nutrient-dense foods, even if your appetite is smaller. Your body needs good fuel to function.
- **Listen to your body.** If you need a short nap, take one. Don't push yourself too hard, especially in the beginning.

**For Headaches:**

- **Hydration is key.** Dehydration is a common culprit for headaches, so keep that water bottle handy.
- **Rest in a quiet, dark place.** Sometimes, all you need is a little peace and quiet.
- **Over-the-counter pain relievers.** If safe for you, medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with headache pain. Always check with your doctor first.

**Heartburn and Injection Site Reactions: Small Annoyances, Big Solutions**

Sometimes it's the smaller, more localized issues that can be the most annoying. Heartburn and reactions at your injection site definitely fit that bill.

**Dealing with Heartburn (GERD):**

- **Smaller meals, again!** Overfilling your stomach can push acid up.
- **Avoid trigger foods.** For many, this includes coffee, chocolate, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and mint. Pay attention to what seems to make yours worse.
- **Elevate your head while sleeping.** Using a wedge pillow or propping up the head of your bed can help keep acid down.
- **Over-the-counter antacids.** Medications like Tums or Gaviscon can offer quick relief. For more persistent issues, your doctor might suggest something stronger.

**Calming Injection Site Reactions:**

- **Rotate your injection sites.** This is crucial! Don't inject in the same spot repeatedly. Alternate between your abdomen, thigh, and upper arm.
- **Ensure proper technique.** Make sure the area is clean and dry. Follow the instructions for your pen carefully.
- **Cool compress.** If you get redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, a cool compress can help soothe it.
- **Let the alcohol dry.** If you're using an alcohol wipe, let the alcohol completely evaporate before injecting.

**The Golden Rule: Communication with Your Healthcare Team**

Look, while these tips can be incredibly helpful, they're not a substitute for professional medical advice. If your side effects are severe, persistent, or just plain worrying you, **please talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.**

They can:

- Offer specific advice tailored to your health history.
- Adjust your Zepbound dosage if needed.
- Suggest prescription medications to help manage more severe symptoms.
- Rule out any other underlying issues.

They are there to support you on this journey, so don't tough it out alone.

Navigating Zepbound side effects can feel like a challenge, but remember, you've got this. Most people find that with patience, smart strategies, and open communication with their healthcare team, these bumps in the road become much more manageable. Keep focusing on your goals, stay hydrated, and be kind to your body. You're making amazing progress, and a few temporary side effects won't stop you!",1,1751481041.0,ZepboundWiki,0,1.0,False

1lq3cxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lq3cxj/does_the_ninja_ss151_blender_truly_deliver/,Does the Ninja SS151 Blender Truly Deliver Powerful Performance?,"Testing out the Ninja SS151 TWISTi Blender DUO over the past few weeks has been a whirlwind of blending, experimenting, and‚Äîif I‚Äôm being honest‚Äîa bit of messy fun. This product combines sleek design, powerful performance, and versatility, all while somehow maintaining a user-friendly approach. As someone who‚Äôs previously wrestled with finicky blender controls and problematic chunkiness in smoothies, this was a refreshing experience, though not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the sleek platinum finish caught my eye. The Ninja SS151 feels sturdy with its 1600 Peak-Watt motor base‚Äîa sign it‚Äôs built to handle tough tasks. Its compact size surprised me; it doesn‚Äôt hog all the counter space but still feels robust enough to stay in place while blending. The physical buttons are large and intuitive, perfect for mornings when pre-coffee coordination is questionable. The twist tamper is the real MVP of the design‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a gimmick. It genuinely works to push ingredients toward the high-speed stainless-steel blades, and I no longer have to stop mid-blend to scrape down the sides of the pitcher.

**Performance and Power**  
Performance was where this blender truly shined. I threw in frozen strawberries, spinach, chia seeds, and ice with reckless abandon, expecting it to stall or leave chunky bits. It didn‚Äôt. The smartTORQUE technology kept the motor running smoothly, even with heavy loads, so there was no need for constant pulse-blending. Making smoothie bowls has always been a challenge with my older blenders, but with the Ninja's built-in Twist Tamper, the consistency came out perfectly thick, just like the trendy bowls you see on Instagram. Whether I was whipping up smoothies or crushing ice for cocktails, this blender performed like a champ.

[Check Ninja SS151 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b09sbrgsfh/)

**Key Benefits**  
- The hybrid-edge blade system blends and chops to perfection, even breaking down ice and nuts with ease.  
- Five automatic settings, including smoothie and frozen drink modes, streamline the blending process with Auto-iQ technology.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts save a ton of time during cleanup.  
- Included to-go cups with lids are great for mornings when I‚Äôm rushing to work.  

**Controls and User Experience**  
Using this blender feels futuristic without being complicated. The physical buttons combine old-school reliability with precise functionality. Auto-iQ technology is like having a personal sous chef‚Äîpre-setting blending, pulsing, and pausing patterns means you don‚Äôt have to babysit the process. I was nervous about trying to make spreads, but one button press later, my almond butter was creamy and smooth. The drizzle cap also turned out to be a surprisingly handy feature‚Äîit let me customize the consistency of soups by adding broth during blending.

**Caveats**  
As much as I love this blender, there are annoyances here and there.  
- The motor is noticeably loud, especially when dealing with harder ingredients like frozen fruits or nuts.  
- At 7.19 pounds, the blender isn‚Äôt the easiest to move around frequently; a more stable spot on your counter is advised.  
- The cord is slightly short, limiting where you can plug it in on some setups.  

**Competing Brands**  
There are plenty of blenders in the mid-price range to compare with the Ninja SS151. Vitamix users often tout better durability and quieter motors, but at significantly higher costs. Meanwhile, NutriBullet blenders shine for portability and single-serve capabilities but fall short for tasks like making spreads or handling larger batches. The Ninja SS151 strikes a balance, offering high-speed, high-power blending at a more accessible price point. Honestly, the added value of the twist tamper and Auto-iQ gives this blender an edge over similarly priced competitors like the Oster Pro Blender.

**Affordable Quality**  
For its performance and versatility, this product delivers consistent results without breaking the bank compared to premium models. The included accessories, like the 34-ounce pitcher and two to-go cups, add extra convenience. While the noise and weight might be minor hurdles, the cost-effectiveness of this blender makes it a worthy investment for anyone who appreciates multi-functionality mixed with reliable results.

Hello! I am looking for recommendations for beds for my almost 3yo. She does still sleep with all four sides of the crib and has never attempted to crawl out... but my two babies are VERY rambunctious, so I have to be mindful of that. 

  
Yesterday, I was in the ER with my 2.5yo & 15mo as my youngest needed stitches (he tripped and fell against our coffee table). While in our room, we saw a toddler being wheeled in from the ambulance and the entire floor ran to help her. We waited in our room for 2 hours (which was fine!), as they were helping a ""very, very critical patient."" It was so heartbreaking, watching the momma being led from the room and hearing her gut-wrenching sobs, and knowing she had lost her little girl. Nurses were still running in and out the entire 3 hours we were there. 

From what I could overhear, the toddler fell from her bed, which had railings, and the mom never heard her fall or heard her screaming. I don't know anything else. 

Witnessing what we did in the ER has left me shell-shocked... and prepared to spend whatever we can on safe bed frames. So, I need all the recommendations, because I can't decide. 

1) Her crib converts into a full-size bed. That has been our plan for years, yet now the headboard and footboard terrify me. We have a four-poster bed ourselves that she's rowdy on, and we have been working with her to stop, but it'll take time. 

2) A twin-size floor bed without any sides/railings. My only concern about this is her outgrowing within a few years. 

3) A twin low-platform bed. Unfortunately, most I find (in the espresso color to match her room) still have the headboard and footboard... and by then, we may as well just convert her crib. 

I have a 7-in high basic Zinus metal bed frame I can use, but I worry that 7in off the ground is too high, when factoring in the Brooklyn Bedding kids twin (which is about 5in tall). That's a foot off the ground, and she's a crazy sleeper!

  
So, any wisdom, insights, recommendations? Am I just overreacting? ",4,1751480386.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much‚Ä¶ Sobs‚Ä¶""

Attached was a photo‚Äîno face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

‚Ä¶

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now‚Äîa true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

‚Ä¶

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam‚Äîthe man she had always loved‚Äîshe didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself‚Äîthe housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but‚Ä¶

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before‚Äînot by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

‚Ä¶

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""‚Ä¶Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing‚Äîno alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

‚Ä¶

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover‚Äîhair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

‚Ä¶

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin‚Äîthe heir to the Goodwin family‚Äîalong with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you‚Ä¶ Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three‚Ä¶ eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time‚Ä¶

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is‚Ä¶ Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn‚Ä¶ Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

‚Ä¶

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer‚Äîmine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.

At this moment, Benjamin rushed over. ""Carly, she's your sister. She's Celine!""

Carly froze in disbelief. ""You're‚Ä¶ Celine?""

Celine knew Carly had always looked down on her.

As children, Carly had bested her at every turn. She had always been outstanding. Later, she even dated Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family.

Raised in a life of luxury and affection, Carly became proud and untouchable.

Benjamin was once again stunned by Celine's exquisite beauty. He murmured, ""I didn't expect Celine to look this stunning.""

Carly's childhood memories of Celine were vague because she had never paid much attention to this unloved sister. But wasn't Celine the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Carly stepped closer. Her gaze swept over Celine with thinly veiled disdain. ""Celine, I didn't expect you to doll yourself up like me.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

Well, Carly could think whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.

Celine straightened her slender back and smiled without saying a word. The corridor lights cast a soft glow on her delicate, ethereal face. She was no longer the same little Celine from before.

Just then, Carly spoke up. ""Celine, I heard you and Adam are divorcing. Can't survive without a man, huh? Resorting to male escorts to fill the void? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

Turning to Adam, she added in a condescending tone, ""Adam, Celine has taken care of you for so long. You should at least help her find work. Maybe as a housekeeper.""

Adam's gaze flickered to Celine.

Benjamin interjected, ""Carly, every job requires qualifications. What's Celine's education level?""

Carly seemed to remember something amusing. She raised her chin with a smile and said, ""She dropped out of school when she was 16.""",1,1751480198.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Lifelong hEDS person here- my symptoms worsened a lot over the last 2-3 years which led me to diagnosis and major life changes, in mid 20s now.

I used occasionally consume substances- namely alcohol, caffeine, weed. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how little I used to have. 1-2 puffs of weed, 1-2 beers in a night, an iced coffee once in a while, you get the picture. 

But now, even a sip of coffee makes me feel like a scared prey animal, palpitations, etc. Weed makes me feel like I‚Äôm tweaking. And alcohol just makes me feel nauseous. This is new, within the past couple of years as my hypermobility stuff has worsened. I now am 100% sober and really miss the rare times I would partake. Does anyone else relate? No provider has ever given me an answer other than ‚Äúit‚Äôs anxiety‚Äù type of thing. ",3,1751480147.0,ehlersdanlos,8,0.72,False

Does anyone have a good solution with product suggestions for how I can clean up this wall power strip? My idea was to have a long horizontal pegboard where I can rest our Steamdeck, Switch, and Laptops but I can't find anything nice looking or even a long shelf that wouldn't look weird so low? 

A vertical pegboard (next to the window) would also block some vision of the TV (I think it'd also be distracting)

I also can't turn our coffee table so the shelf pictured is closer to the outlet (there's a drawer facing the couch) ",1,1751480137.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Speaker=boss

[INT. HIDEOUT ‚Äì NIGHT]

The door creaks open as a woman walks in, followed closely by two others. They make their way toward their boss, who sits in a dimly lit room, surrounded by scattered papers and half-drunk coffee.

Boss (sternly):
You‚Äôre back earlier than I expected. Did you get the money?

Angela (irritated):
No. They didn‚Äôt have it. Turns out they spent it all on booze and‚Ä¶ who knows what else.

Lucia (disgusted):
They were begging for their lives like we were going to just let them off the hook.

Boss (rolling her eyes):
Of course they didn‚Äôt. Those two waste everything on drugs and alcohol. Pathetic. Nothing but a couple of lifeless addicts.

Sarah (quietly):
Hey, boss‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something else. We brought someone with us.

Boss (raising an eyebrow):
What? What could you three possibly have brought me? [Her tone sharpens, filled with suspicion.]

Sarah steps aside, revealing a small child standing nervously behind her.

Boss (startled):
A child? Where did you find him?

Sarah:
He was hiding behind the couch. I approached him slowly‚Äîhe was scared. But I told him we weren‚Äôt going to hurt him.

Boss (softening):
I see‚Ä¶ Let me take a closer look.

The boss stands and walks over, her eyes narrowing as she inspects the child. Her gaze lands on a dark mark on his neck.

Boss (concerned):
What‚Äôs this? What happened to your neck?

The child flinches and steps back slightly.

Boss (gently):
It‚Äôs okay, sweetheart. I just want to see if you‚Äôre alright. I promise, no one here is going to hurt you.

Slowly, the child allows her to come closer. As she examines him more closely, her expression shifts to horror.

Boss (gasping):
Oh god‚Ä¶ Why do you have so many cuts and bruises?

The child hesitates, then quietly begins to explain what happened. The boss listens intently, her jaw tightening as tears begin to form in her eyes. She kneels and pulls him into a warm hug.

Boss (voice breaking):
You poor thing‚Ä¶ You didn‚Äôt deserve any of that. But it‚Äôs over now. You‚Äôre safe. I promise. Angela, Lucia‚Äîtake him to the bathroom. Get him cleaned up. After that, bring him to my room. He needs to rest.

Sarah:
Come on, little guy. Let‚Äôs get you washed up.

Lucia:
I‚Äôll bring you something to eat once you‚Äôre done.

Angela:
Looks like I‚Äôm on bandage duty.

The boy looks away, unsure, but allows them to guide him out of the room. The door closes behind them.

[TIME SKIP ‚Äì 45 MINUTES LATER]

[INT. BOSS‚ÄôS BEDROOM ‚Äì LATER]

The boss steps into her room. The boy is now wrapped in a clean blanket, sitting quietly on the bed. The three women stand nearby, watching over him.

Boss (smiling softly):
Good. I see he‚Äôs starting to settle in. You‚Äôve done well. You can leave us now‚ÄîI‚Äôll take it from here.

All Three:
Yes, ma‚Äôam.

They exit quietly, leaving the room calm and quiet. The boy glances away, his expression conflicted, on the edge of tears.

Boss (gently):
Right now, we don‚Äôt have a spare room for you. I‚Äôve got stuff scattered everywhere, so‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll be staying in here with me for now. At least until I get things sorted‚Äîor we move somewhere better.

The boy turns away, visibly trembling. The boss sits beside him, then slowly wraps her arms around him.

Boss (softly):
You don‚Äôt have to be scared anymore. It‚Äôs okay to cry. They‚Äôre not here. They can‚Äôt hurt you. You‚Äôre mine now‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll take care of you.

The child buries his face in her shoulder and finally breaks down. The boss holds him tightly, rubbing his back gently and humming a soft tune to calm him.

Boss (whispering):
Shhh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs alright. Let it out.

She gently wipes away his tears.

Boss:
Let‚Äôs get some sleep, alright? I‚Äôll be right here with you. We can cuddle up. You‚Äôre safe now.

They lie down under the covers. She holds him close.

Boss (kissing his forehead):
When you wake up tomorrow, I‚Äôll make you breakfast. Then we‚Äôll go out and get you some new clothes. Good night, little one.

The child closes his eyes as she hums softly, both slowly drifting into sleep.
