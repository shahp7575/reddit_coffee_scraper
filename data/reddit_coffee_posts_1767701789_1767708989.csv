The last 2-3 years he’s just becoming more of shell of himself. Lucid mostly, but fading. Quiet, sleeps more than he’s awake, and when he’s awake he’s quiet, very quiet. You can have “how about them Hawkeyes” conversations with him, but no deeper. He gets too confused. 

Well my mom called me last night to talk about what’s happened the last few days. He soiled himself. Like need to clean the sheets and get the carpet cleaner out to clean up the trail of shit on the floor type of soiling. And secondly, he’s starting to wander. He went outside in his underwear mom found him in less than five minutes but it was close. It was the first time this happened. My mom is a retired RN who worked most of her career on a memory unit so she’s equipment better than most spouses dealing with a loved one (blessing and a curse) so we had an hour long conversation about new safety measures, doctors appointments, redlines of when to make the call to place him in a nursing facility. It was a hard conversation.  

Then went to bed and I had a dream of him. It shook me to my core it woke me up this morning. I usually don’t remember my dreams, this one every detail is seared into my brain. I broke down crying making coffee. That’s when I decided to dictate the details into ChatGPT to help me narrate the dream logic. It’s making me cry even more because it’s spot on recreation. Below is a ChatGPT assisted narrative of my dream

I was talking to my dad about my dad.

The place didn’t matter. It felt like home without being one—familiar, weightless. He looked the way I remembered him from years ago: steady, intact, fully present. The version of him who could listen all the way through a hard conversation.

I chose my words carefully.

“He’s starting to wander,” I said. “He doesn’t always know where he is.”

My dad nodded, concerned but calm.

“He went outside the other night. It was below freezing. He was in his underwear. Mom caught him after a few minutes, but it was close.”

“That’s scary,” he said. “What are you going to do?”

I told him about the illness next—the loss of control, the messes that arrived without warning and took dignity with them. Saying it out loud made my chest tighten, even here.

Then it clicked.

I was talking to my dad about my dad.

The realization didn’t shock me. It just settled in. For a moment I wondered if I meant my grandfather, but no—this was him. I was describing his unraveling to the version of him who still existed clearly in my mind.

He didn’t question it. He just listened.

That’s when I noticed his hand. He kept rubbing his leg, the same spot, again and again.

“What’s going on with your leg?” I asked.

“Oh, nothing,” he said. “Just a little infection.”

“Show me.”

He turned his leg casually, unconcerned—and I saw it.

A massive abscess bulged beneath the skin, grotesque and wrong, the skin stretched tight around it. At the center was an open sore, raw and weeping. He was rubbing it absentmindedly, making it worse without knowing it.

“Dad, stop,” I said. “Don’t touch that.”

“It’s fine,” he said. “It’s fine.”

“No,” I said, urgency flooding in. “It’s not fine. We’re calling an ambulance. We’re going to the hospital.”

That’s when he faded.

Not abruptly—just a slow dimming. The clarity left his eyes. His certainty collapsed inward. The man I’d been talking to—the father I could reason with—quietly slipped away.

In his place was the man I know now: confused, resistant, unreachable just when help matters most.

And before I could do anything to stop it, I woke up.",1,1767708230.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

> Samsung has revealed that the Jet Bot Steam Ultra uses the Qualcomm Dragonwing AI chipset, an Active Stereo 3D sensor for obstacle detection that can also detect various types of liquids, including coffee, juice, and clear liquid.

> The robotic vacuum cleaner also packs an enhanced version of Bixby, which allows you to talk to it in natural language. For example, you can say, “Hi, Bixby, I’m going out for lunch so could you please clean my bedroom?” The Jet Bot Steam Ultra will understand your question/command and act on it.

https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-reveals-more-details-jet-bot-steam-ultra-ces-2026/


> Samsung has announced that the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) has awarded the 2025 lineup of its Bespoke AI robot vacuum cleaners with IoT Standard certification, the agency’s highest rating for Internet of Things (IoT) security certification.

Worth noting as the Korean consumer agency found cybersecurity issues with Dreame’s app (you can activate the camera externally), ecovacs’ app(same issue as the X2 Omni where the longstanding issue of being able to send malware through the robot hasn’t been fixed and you can search and steal photos ), and Narwal’s app (you can search and steal photos). https://www.kca.go.kr/eng/sub.do?menukey=6007&mode=view&no=1003929965

These breaches are fixed with the KCA saying these companies have taken action. Something tells me that if brands listened to Dennis Giese and actually patched these issues, a cybersecurity researcher who informed the public about these vulnerabilities,  this wouldn’t have happened in the first place. 

> During the review of policy management, the Dreame product was found to have inadequate policies regarding the management of personal data, posing the risk of user information such as names and contact details being leaked.
> While such leaks are unlikely under normal use, the vulnerabilities could be exploited by hackers with advanced skills. The company was immediately instructed to fix the issue, and appropriate measures were taken.
> During the review of device security, two products, Dreame and Ecovacs, were found to have relatively low levels of hardware security. Overall, firmware
security settings across all tested products wereinsufficient, making the internal
security structure vulnerable to external exposure.

All other devices’ hardware security (LG, Narwal, roborock, and Samsung) were rated at a 2/3 star rating which means good (the best grade is excellent which is three stars).

When you see the label on your coffee, you can be sure that you’ve found a product grown and produced under rigorous standards that protect farmers, workers, and the environment. Fair Trade Standards ensure:  

* Fair, stable prices for farmers which helps offer protection within volatile markets.  
* Safe working conditions, and the prohibition of forced or child labor.  
* Distribution of Community Development Funds: part of the premium paid for certified coffee goes into Community Development Funds to support local projects chosen by workers including education, healthcare, infrastructure, cash payouts, and more. 
* Environmentally sustainable farming: certified farms follow guidelines to protect natural ecosystems, avoid deforestation, encourage biodiversity, and use fertilizers/pesticides responsibly.  
* Transparent, traceable supply chains: certification helps ensure that from bean to cup, coffee is produced under fair and ethical conditions.  

Where to find certified coffee:  

Certified coffee can be found at a wide variety of stores including Costco, Whole Foods, Kroger, and anywhere else you buy your coffee!

1q5jeaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1q5jeaa/nonalcoholic_beverage_sales_stay_resilient_in/,"Non-Alcoholic Beverage Sales Stay Resilient in December, Led by Energy and Coconut Water","Non-alcoholic beverages ended December on relatively solid footing, according to new NielsenIQ data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. While growth modestly decelerated, demand across several key categories remained healthy, highlighting where consumers are still spending — and where cracks are forming.

Across all non-alc beverages, dollar sales grew 4.5% year-over-year in the two-week period ending Dec. 13. Volume was slightly positive at +0.8%, while pricing continued to do much of the heavy lifting at +3.7%. In short: consumers are still buying, but growth is increasingly price-driven.

Energy drinks remain the standout.

Energy posted +12% dollar growth in the two-week period, with volume up 9.1%, reinforcing that this category is still expanding on real consumption, not just price increases. Brands like Celsius (+22.8% sales), GHOST (+19.7%), and Monster (+12.5%) continue to outperform, while legacy players inside large portfolios (notably PepsiCo’s energy assets excluding Celsius) saw sharp declines.

Carbonated soft drinks show a split personality.

Overall CSD sales rose \~3%, but that growth came almost entirely from pricing. Regular soda volumes declined nearly 4%, while low-calorie CSDs continued to post double-digit dollar growth. Functional soda brands like OLIPOP once again stood out, with +22.8% sales growth driven by a massive +33.6% volume increase, signaling continued consumer interest in “better-for-you” carbonation.

Coconut water continues to surge.

Coconut water remains one of the healthiest growth stories in non-alc, with +20.4% dollar growth and +12.3% volume growth. Both Vita Coco and Harmless Harvest posted strong double-digit gains, reinforcing coconut water’s position as a hydration staple rather than a trend.

Meanwhile, pressure is building elsewhere.

Bottled water growth slowed to just +1.4%, sports drinks decelerated to +2.2%, and RTD coffee declined -4.3% as volumes fell across most major brands. Sparkling water also continues to struggle on volume despite price increases, suggesting saturation and waning excitement in the category.

Taken together, the data paints a clear picture: categories offering energy, functionality, or clear use-case benefits are still winning, while more commoditized or crowded segments are leaning heavily on pricing to sustain growth.

As pricing power starts to fade and volume growth becomes harder to find, which non-alc categories are best positioned to deliver *real* consumption growth in 2025 — and which ones are masking deeper demand issues with price alone?

1q5jdl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1q5jdl9/the_phantom_cabinet_chapter_7_part_2/,The Phantom Cabinet: Chapter 7 (Part 2),"In the realm of sensory perceptions, few sounds are as petrifying as a child’s laughter in an empty room. Merriment that would ordinarily provoke no discomfort becomes a disturbing portent, forecasting a brush with the uncanny. 

 

Margo Hellenberg sat in her Hilltop Middle School classroom, her hands in constant motion—cutting construction paper, coloring poster board—designing a game for her seventh grade special education class. Once completed, the board would provide a lesson on synonyms and antonyms. She’d give her students one word at a time, which they’d attach to the poster board, under “Synonym” or “Antonym”, using Fun-Tak. 

 

Without her pupils, the classroom was a lonely place. Still, she often stayed late into the night, as she had no husband and no family in the area. She didn’t date or socialize, barely even watched TV. Stated simply, her job was her life. 

 

Ms. Hellenberg had one of *those* faces, equally innocent and ancient. She could have been thirty or seventy-five, but had actually survived for forty-six summers. Her clothing was drab, her makeup sparse. Her tight ponytail emphasized a severe widow’s peak.     

 

When the giggle sounded, all concerns fell away. The hilarity was young and asexual, a high-pitched titter of no immediate origin. 

 

“Hello?” Margo gasped. “Where are you? Who are you?”

 

In lieu of an answer, the laughter returned. With it came suppressed memories of Margo’s childhood, when everything about her—her clothes, her hair, even the way she talked—had earned only peer ridicule. It became an amalgamation of every chuckle at her expense, every snicker, decades of mockery manifested. 

 

“Stop it!” Margo cried. “Leave me alone, goddamn you!” 

 

She eyed the door, preparing for a freedom dash. It swung open of its own accord, then shut, then opened again. 

 

The lights went off, as the door slammed forcefully. The laughter grew deafening, threaded with inhuman tones. Overwhelmed, Margo fainted into merciful oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Carter cracked his bedroom window open, craving fresh air. There was something incongruous about the next-door residence, that of Angus Capovilla and Walter Sanborn.

 

Angus and Walter were both octogenarians, and were purportedly the best of friends. But to anyone observing their furtive, loving glances, it was obvious that they were far more than that. As the two generally kept to themselves, Carter was shocked to see a woman in their second-floor window. 

 

She pressed naked against the glass, built like a slab of beef. Unblinking, she glowered down at him, standing perfectly still, arms hanging limp at her sides.

 

Carter shivered under the woman’s scrutiny. Her physical features were supernaturally defined; from her sagging breasts and abdomen to her loose golden hair, it was as if she was standing right in front of him. He saw a bulbous nose framed by acne scars, set in a vacant face. Her pubic thatch was wild and untrimmed.       

 

*What does she want?* he wondered. *Why won’t she look somewhere else?*

 

If her intent was seduction, she’d failed miserably. Looking at her was like glimpsing an elderly relative in the shower, a shameful and embarrassing sight. With her constant stillness, she could have been a wax museum sculpture. Perhaps she was mentally disabled, or experiencing a break from reality. 

 

Their uncomfortable eye contact continued, drawn out for what seemed an eternity. Carter felt trapped by her gaze, like a deer facing Mack truck headlights. 

 

“Hey, Dad, guess what?” Douglas called from the hallway. “*Battle Beyond the Stars* is on! Do you wanna come watch it?”

 

With that, the spell was broken. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Resisting the ravenous drag of expatriate souls, Commander Gordon manifested. From Douglas’ living room he drifted, passing through walls and fence, seeking the home next-door. 

 

In the geriatrics’ shared bedroom, he beheld a wide, cellulite-stippled backside, which he’d last glimpsed inside a doomed orbiter. *“Melanie Sarnoff,”* he greeted. *“Looks like I’m not the only crewmember to make it back.”*

 

The specter gave no response. 

 

“*Melanie, I know you can hear me. Turn around so we can talk.”*

 

She turned slowly.  

 

*“Commander Gordon…is that really you?”*

 

*“It’s me, sweetheart. Even death couldn’t keep me down. Speaking of death, how are you handling yours?”*

 

*“Oh…well, you shouldn’t worry about me. I’m just tired, is all, and having a hard time remembering things. What were we doing on the Conundrum, Commander? What was the point of it all?”*

 

Choosing his words carefully, Gordon answered, *“We were chasing a phantom transmission, my dear, from somewhere in outer space. The rest is a blur. I think that the Phantom Cabinet fragmented our memories, leaving us incomplete. I’ve been doing some detective work, though, with the help of some other spirits. The launch involved secret politics, they tell me, stretching all the way to the White House.”*  

 

*“Maybe it’s best not to know,”* Melanie replied. *“Sometimes the truth is just too much. But, it’s like…what do we do now? I’m so confused.”*

 

Gordon scratched his chin. *“Well, you can stand here until the sun burns out, or you can return to the Phantom Cabinet and dissolve into the next generation of souls. I’d recommend the latter.”*

 

*“And you, Commander? What keeps you here?”*

 

He pointed at the Stanton home.

In his dream, Douglas walked alone, traversing a slender hallway. The walls flaked yellow paint onto a torn, stained carpet. Along them, moldy wainscoting trailed. Something was chasing Douglas, its identity a mystery. 

 

Douglas pressed forward intently, accelerating to a full-blown sprint. Following the hall’s twisted path, he turned left and right, encountering neither door nor window. The ceiling pressed downward, its stucco bumps sprouting into jagged stalactites, dripping milky fluid.  

 

Finally, when he was ready to let the unknown pursuer claim him, the hall dead-ended. Skidding to a stop, he encountered a giant mirror. On the mirror’s surface floated a giant porcelain mask—a mask instantly recognizable—enlarged to elephantine proportions. 

 

The mask slowly descended, seemingly of its own accord, unveiling a hidden countenance an inch at a time. The revealed face was Douglas’ own, much magnified. His mirror doppelganger radiated pure hatred.

 

Unable to cope with the sight, he bashed his fist against the glass. The mirror shattered, and Douglas’ dream voyage followed suit. He awoke to the sound of his own screams. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“What’s up, Douglas? This is Emmett. Sorry we haven’t hung out since the bonfire. I’ve been spending a lot of time with Etta lately.”

 

“Yeah, I’ve noticed. You guys are like a couple of Siamese twins, like you’re actually growing into each other.”

 

“You’re weird. I mean, who says shit like that? Aw, it doesn’t matter. The reason I’m calling is to see if you’re going to the dance. Etta and I are going, and we’re trying to get a group together.”

 

“What, people don’t ignore me enough at school? They gotta ignore me to music now?”

 

“Christ, bro, could you feel any sorrier for yourself?”

 

“I’ll never know until I try. Still, I say that there’s no way in Hell you’ll see me at that dance.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, when Friday rolled around, Douglas found himself inside the school’s gymnasium, watching his classmates awkwardly shuffling.

 

The dance had a tropical theme, which he’d been entirely unaware of. Blue and green metallic streamers hung from the walls, poorly attempting to mimic an ocean’s shimmering surface. Upon the streamers, construction paper starfish and palm trees had been stapled. 

 

At the head of the gym stood a DJ, wearing an oversized straw hat and a puka shell necklace. Atop a raised platform, he spun recent pop hits on polished Technics turntables. The man looked bored out of his mind, and possibly stoned, but the music skipped not a beat. 

 

Douglas’ male classmates wore Hawaiian shirts and swim trunks. Some even sported sandals, which led to foot trampling during slow ballads. Girls wore flowers in their hair, hula skirts, and white cover-up dresses. Douglas wore the same thing he’d worn to school that day: torn jeans and a faded Polo shirt. 

 

Teachers wandered between the dancers, attempting to keep the kids from grinding. The way that some students were going at it, it seemed that Oceanside’s strip clubs would be well stocked in forthcoming years. Another teacher— mustached math instructor, Mr. Wilkens—danced dangerously close to a cluster of girls, “accidently” bumping against them again and again. His predatory grin and sickly gleaming eyes were enough to make one shudder. 

 

Douglas stood in the back of the room, behind a table stocked with fruit punch, fruit slices and fruit snacks. He avoided eye contact with those around him, contemplating another Phantom Cabinet sojourn.  

 

After Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey” ended, Emmett came over and playfully punched Douglas’ shoulder.

 

“Douglas…” he said, drawing out the last syllable until the name lost all meaning. “I’m glad you made it, man. Fun dance, huh?”

 

Scrutinizing his friend, Douglas saw bright yellow Ray-Bans—hanging uselessly on a tie-dyed Croakie—and a neon green tank top, and knew that any criticism he could conjure would be summarily ignored. Instead, he nodded, endeavoring to appear less miserable. 

 

“Man, I’ve been dancin’ up a storm. My legs are so sore I’ll be rockin’ a wheelchair tomorrow. You gonna hit the dance floor, or what? I know standing around with your hands in your pockets is exhilarating and all, but getting up close with a female is even better.”

 

“Oh, I don’t know. The girls here don’t seem all that fond of me.”

 

“There you go again, always feelin’ sorry for yourself. Do you cry yourself to sleep every night? Is your tampon uncomfortable? Do you need the number of a good therapist? Can you feel—”

 

“Alright, enough of that. If I ask a girl to dance, will you shut the fuck up? I mean, seriously…”

 

“I just might, if she actually dances with you. Otherwise, you’ll have to keep trying until you strike gold.”

 

“Christ, we could be here all night. Remind me again, why do I let you talk me into these things?”

 

“That’s easy. My voice is so silky smooth that it’s impossible to ignore. How can the voices in your head compete?”

 

“You’d be surprised.”

 

Etta pranced over, her oversized gold earrings matching her sun top. She appeared so full of energy that she might vibrate through the floor. 

 

“There you are,” she said, lightly slapping Emmett’s arm. “I was wondering where you got off to. Did you forget about me?” As an afterthought, she added, “Oh…hi, Douglas.”

 

“Hi.”

 

“So, what are you two gentlemen talking about?”

 

“Douglas is going to ask a girl to dance.”

 

“Alright! That’s what I like to hear! Which girl caught your eye, Dougie? I can put in a good word.”     

 

Douglas mumbled, “No, that’s okay. I’m…evaluating my options.”

 

“Playing the field, huh? That’s respectable.” Grabbing Emmett’s hand, she dragged him back to the dance floor.

 

Reluctantly, Douglas scanned his surroundings, searching for an unoccupied female with a friendly face. Spying Starla Smith—hair pinned up, wearing a flowing floral print party dress—Douglas glanced away quickly. If forced to choose between asking Starla to dance and wearing sandpaper underpants for a week, he’d have chosen the underpants. 

 

Next, he spotted Karen Sakihama, swaying alone. He probably still reminded her of Benjy, Douglas figured. No way would she dance with him.

 

And then he saw her: a gangly girl, vaguely familiar, whom he’d likely passed in the hall many times without registering her presence. She was neither beautiful nor ugly, but could drift into either realm given time. She leaned against her own wall, clutching an empty plastic cup, staring at nothing in particular. The girl looked as miserable as Douglas felt. 

 

Her eyes were too close together, above a disproportionately large nose. Her dirty blonde hair was frizzy, in need of a brushing. Her posture was less than exemplary. Before Douglas knew what he was doing, he’d crossed the hardwood. 

 

Registering his presence, the girl’s azure eyes widened. “Hi…” she said awkwardly, looking anywhere but at Douglas.

 

“Hello there. I don’t mean to bother you, but I saw you standing here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.”

 

Her face reddened. “Yeah, a boy asked me to meet him, but he never showed up.”

 

“What a dick,” Douglas said with false sympathy. 

 

“I want to get out of here, but maybe he’s late or something. I don’t get asked out much, you know.”

 

“Sure… Oh, by the way, my name’s Douglas Stanton.”

 

“Sandra Olson. My friends call me Sandy.”

 

“Sandy Olson, I like it.”

 

“Who said you’re my friend?”

 

“Okay, Sandra then.”

 

“I’m kidding. Gosh, I suck at introductions. Maybe we should just dance.”

 

*Wow, that was simple*, Douglas thought, as he replied, “Hmm, that could be fun.”

 

Arms linked, they stepped amidst the dancers. It was just Douglas’ luck that the DJ chose that moment to play a slow tune, Aerosmith’s “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing.” Douglas hated both the song and the band passionately, but was in too deep to back out. 

 

Arms wrapped around each other, they shifted from left to right. Their cheeks were nearly touching, and Douglas’ palms grew uncomfortably sweaty. 

 

There was too much perfume and cologne in the air, forming a toxic cloud that made his eyes itch. He enjoyed the feel of a girl pressed against him, but the act of dancing seemed an archaic mating ritual. When the song finally ended, it came as a relief. 

 

Sandy drew away. “That was…fun,” she said. “Thank you, Douglas.”

 

“Don’t mention it.”

 

“You wanna dance again, next slow song?” she asked, as a neutered version of 2Pac and Dr. Dre’s “California Love” played in the background.

 

“I’d like to, but I told my dad I’d be home early. Maybe I’ll see you around school some time.”

 

“Maybe you will. See ya later, Douglas.”

 

“Bye.”

 

With that, he was gone, fleeing the gymnasium without a second glance. He’d hated lying to Sandra, sure, but an introvert’s school spirit only stretches so far. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The next morning, Emmett came to visit, smiling broadly under a Red Sox hat.

 

“What’s up, player?” he asked, playfully slapping Douglas’ shoulder, just a little too hard. “I saw you dancin’ last night, with a girl and everything. You ducked out before I could congratulate you, but nice work.”

 

“Thanks…I guess.”

 

Emmett pushed past Douglas, into the Stanton living room. Douglas had no choice but to follow.

 

“Hey, I’m making omelets,” Carter called from the kitchen. “You boys hungry?”

 

“Sure thing, Mr. Stanton,” Emmett responded. Then, in a subdued tone, he turned to Douglas and asked, “So, did you get her number? Should we set up a double date?”

 

“No dice.”

 

“You didn’t get the digits? Man, I swear there’s something wrong with you. Did you at least get her name?”

 

“Yeah, yeah. It’s Sandra Olson, a.k.a. Sandy.”

 

“Sandy Olson, I can work with that. Grab your phone for me, would ya?”

 

Douglas squinted, growing suspicious. “My phone? Who do you need to call?”

 

“Oh, I need to hit up Etta and ask her something.”

 

“Fine.” Douglas fetched the cordless. 

 

Emmett dialed a number from memory. “Hey, Etta, you know who this is? Yeah, it’s me. What up, baby girl? Yeah, last night was fun, wasn’t it? Actually, that’s why I’m calling. You remember when we saw my boy Douglas dancing? Remember that girl? Her name’s Sandy Olson. Oh, you do know her. You wouldn’t happen to have her phone number, would you? Hold on, let me get something to write with.”

 

Emmett made a scribbling motion, sign language for “grab me a fucking pencil.” Douglas shook his head no.

 

“You know what, Etta? Our pal Douglas is being a bitch right now. Just read me the number and I’ll try to remember it. Yeah, I got it. Sure, it was good talking to you, too. I’ll call you later, girl.”

 

As Emmett punched in the new number, Douglas raised his palms in supplication. “Really, you don’t have to do this. I’m not trying to be set up right now.”

 

“Hush up, son. You’ll thank me later.”

 

“Emmett, come on…”

 

Emmett held up a finger for silence. “Hello, is Sandy Olson there? Oh, this *is* Sandy. Hey, you don’t know me, but my name’s Emmett Wilson. I’m going out with Etta. Yeah, your history class study buddy. She says, ‘Hi,’ by the way. Anyhow, the reason I’m calling is to speak with you about our mutual friend. You know, *Douglas Stanton*. Douglas Stanton, the boy you were dancing with last night. Yeah, *him*.”

 

Douglas cringed, helpless in the face of well-intentioned meddling. He wanted to snatch the phone away and smash it against the wall, but the damage was already done. 

 

“Douglas had a lot of fun last night. In fact, he had so much fun that he wants to take you to dinner sometime, or maybe a movie. Why am I calling? Well, you see, Douglas is a shy dude. He’s a great guy when you get to know him, but sometimes he needs a little help in the socialization department. You know how it is. So…whatcha think? Are you down to spend more time with him?”

 

In a moment of supreme hatred, Douglas wished that his friend’s head would explode, in grisly replication of that famous *Scanners* scene. It didn’t, of course.

 

“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Let me know if you change your mind. Goodbye, Sandy. I’ll see you at school, I’m sure.”

 

Clicking the phone off, Emmett turned to Douglas. “I’m sorry, buddy,” he said consolingly. “I put in a good word for you, but she’s just not interested. We’ll find you a different girl, don’t worry.”

 

Carter ambled into the room, holding two plates of omelets. “Here you go, boys,” he said. “Eat right at the couch if you like.”

 

“Thanks, Mr. Stanton,” said Emmett, already digging into his eggs. “Ooh, this is good.”

 

Douglas’ hunger had abated, replaced by seething rage. In all his years of being bullied, he’d never felt so angry, like a coiled spring awaiting release. 

 

Eleven minutes later, after Carter left for work, Emmett considered Douglas’ untouched omelet. “If you’re not hungry, I could eat that,” he suggested. 

 

Douglas’ rage finally boiled over. “What the fuck was that?” he bellowed. “Did I ask you to call Sandy? Fuck no, I didn’t! You come here and embarrass me, and now you want my eggs? I’d rather throw them out!”

 

Emmett held up placating hands. “I wasn’t trying to embarrass you, man. If anything, I was trying to help you. I know we don’t hang out much anymore, so I thought I’d set you up with someone. It’s not healthy to sit by yourself all the time.”

 

“Now you want to tell me what’s healthy? Who the fuck do you think you are? You date one girl, *one girl*, and all of a sudden, you’re Mr. Know-It-All. Well, I got news for you. As far as I’m concerned, we stopped being friends the night Benjy died.”

 

Now Emmett grew angry. “You mean when you killed him, right? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Benjy was my best friend—since kindergarten, goddammit. Then you came along and caved his fucking skull in, smashed it like an old jack-o’-lantern. We should’ve never let you hang out with us!”

 

As simple as that, their friendship was irrevocably severed. They scowl-dueled for a few moments, and then Emmett barged out the door.

 

Dark clouds perched malignantly atop the horizon, harbingers of a coming storm. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Milo Black smiled at the blackening sky, his intentions far from noble. Standing in the well-kept backyard of his neighbors’ house, he discovered that the sliding glass door was unlocked. Wasting not a moment, he slid it open and stepped into the domicile of Rick and Rita Vaughn. 

 

Milo had drifted from Clark’s orbit. The sovereign bully had built himself a new friend circle, leaving Milo by the wayside. With hours of newfound free time, Milo had been forced to find new diversions. 

 

His parents weren’t wealthy, and couldn’t afford video games or movie outings. Hell, they didn’t even have cable television. What Milo did have, however, was a number of neighbors who left their homes vacant during the day. 

 

Some worked full time jobs; others ran errands for hours. So Milo had devised a little game for himself: sneaking into their homes and seeing what turned up. 

 

He didn’t consider himself a criminal, and so limited his home invasions to places with unlocked doors, or open windows he could crawl through. First, he’d wait for a vehicle to depart one of the surrounding residences. After ensuring that the coast was clear, he would creep his way over. He’d check every point of possible ingress, and vacate immediately when finding them locked. 

 

But sometimes the homes proved accessible. That was where the real fun began. Milo would explore drawers and cupboards, closets and attics. Sometimes, he’d discover money stashed away. Other times, he’d come across caches of pornography, cigarettes or hard liquor. Those treasures found their way under his bed, to be enjoyed at leisure. 

 

When unearthing money, nudie magazines or adult substances, he would never steal the entire stash, so that the theft wouldn’t be immediately observed. Since he’d yet to see a patrol car in his area, he assumed that he’d been successful. 

 

While he enjoyed the stolen items, the real thrill came from being in someone else’s house without permission. When invited into a residence, a visitor sees exactly what the homeowner wishes them to see. Certain rooms may be off limits, indefensible objects will have been stashed away, and some manner of cleaning will have gone down just prior. Only through secret entry can one see a home’s natural state, with all of its dirt and blemishes. One can learn a lot about its owner that way. 

 

For instance, Milo had recently entered the Bavitz residence. Their walls were adorned with photos of their children and grandchildren; their coffee table proudly displayed the latest issues of *Better Homes and Gardens* and *Variety*. In the couple’s bedroom, however, Milo chanced upon quite a scene. Upon cum-stained bed sheets, a cornucopia of bondage gear had been arrayed: slave harnesses, zippered facemasks, whips and restraints—all of black leather. Likewise, their dresser drawers had been filled with incongruous outfits: postman, Catholic priest, cheerleader, Boy Scout, nurse, schoolgirl, and what appeared to be an adult-sized Cabbage Patch Kid outfit, complete with a pigtailed wig. It had been quite the eye-opening experience. 

 

Over the course of Milo’s excursions, he’d sampled refrigerated leftovers, strummed acoustic guitars, and even sniffed the unwashed panties of Shawna, his attractive teenage neighbor. Occasionally, in his more malicious moods, he’d left things behind: dead rodents, rotted fruit, sometimes even a urine puddle in the back of a closet. Of what possessed him to do these things, Milo had no idea. He’d never been one for psychoanalysis.   

 

It was his first time in the Vaughn residence. He didn’t know what he’d find there, but his mind swam with possibilities. Maybe they kept a room filled with exotic snakes, or a chest stuffed with vintage Spanish coins. Maybe they had a homeless man in a cage. 

 

The kitchen was unremarkable: white orchid wallpaper, dishes stacked carefully in the sink, a small oak table. The refrigerator was filled with health food, none of which looked appealing. There wasn’t a drop of liquor in sight. 

 

Bored, Milo moved into the living room, finding a large television perched atop a hardwood stand. Within the stand, there was a VCR, flanked by videocassettes, mostly boring historical dramas. Perhaps he’d have better luck in the Vaughns’ bedroom. 

 

Before he could leave the living room, something caught his attention. There was someone on the white leather couch, which had been empty just seconds before. There was a man there, staring with unblinking, bloodshot eyes. His hair was long and grey; his attire consisted of long underwear and a flannel shirt. Most disturbing was the fact that he had no lower jaw, leaving exposed tendons clearly visible. Where the lower mandible should’ve been, a yawning chasm gushed blood over a shredded, lolling tongue. The blood evaporated in thin air, leaving the couch unblemished. 

 

“Uh…sorry,” Milo muttered. He backed away from the man, who just sat there, unmoving. Milo wasn’t sure if the guy was alive or dead, and had no desire to find out. 

 

Seeking the sliding glass door, he beheld a fresh arrival. She was of obvious African descent, a wiry old broad, her hair tied up in a scarf. Carved animal bones were her bracelets and earrings. Her flowing red dress trailed down to simple leather sandals. An albino python was draped over her shoulders. Over her face, a skull design had been painted. 

 

*“What brings you here, my boy?*” the woman asked, stepping forward as her serpent flicked its tongue. *“Unburden yourself for Auntie Marie.”*

 

“I…I have to go.”

 

*“Don’t be unsociable, child. You haven’t even met my companion.”*

 

“Companion? You mean your snake? Listen, I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m not getting any closer to it.” He was perspiring heavily, beginning to hyperventilate. 

 

*“I speak not of the python, child. I’m referring to my servant, standing just behind you. Step forward, Santiago.”*

 

Milo turned and screamed. There was a grey dwarf, standing scarcely more than two feet high, naked and completely hairless. The dwarf’s arms had been cut off at the elbow, with the forearms of a giant sewn on in their place. The limp, useless limbs dragged across the carpet as the strange little man advanced.  

 

Milo’s bladder let go, but he was beyond noticing. The living room filled with spectral figures, each eye blink revealing another. Milo saw a clown wearing a kelp wig, a mother breastfeeding an infant’s corpse. He saw Inuits, Nazis, Iraqis, and Romans staring hungrily, coveting his life spark. They surrounded him on all sides, as he revolved around and around, desperate for a getaway. 

 

Groped by disgruntled spirits, forgotten victims of a malicious world, Milo cried freely. His tears evoked no sympathy, not an ounce of respite. 

 

The gropes turned to scratches, which evolved into punches and kicks. Milo collapsed under the fusillade, attempting to curl into the fetal position. He beseeched his persecutors, pleading for mercy with each fleeting breath. But the dead offered no mercy. When Marie the voodoo priestess finally gouged Milo’s eyes out, it almost came as a relief.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

With one indifferent arm, Rick Vaughn ushered his wife into their residence. His back was acting up again, demanding three or four Advils. 

 

“That restaurant was terrible, don’t you think?” Rita asked, before answering her own question. “Sure it was. The waiter took *forever* to bring us our pasta, which wasn’t even warm. I’m telling you, it’s time to contact the Better Business Bureau. My stomach is so upset, I can barely concentrate.”

 

“You’re right, dear,” Rick replied. Personally, he’d found the food quite succulent, but knew that expressing a contradictory viewpoint would send his wife into hysterics. “Do you want me to grab you a couple of Tums?” 

 

“No, those things never work. Why don’t I lie down on the couch, and you can massage me for a while?”

 

“If that’s what you want, honey, I’d be happy to.”

 

In the living room, a disturbing tableau awaited. A child’s body, torn limb from limb, was spread from the couch to the closet, his pulped organs nestling in shallow crimson puddles. Contusions and fragmented bones were all that remained of his torso and face. A mass of intestines dangled from his slit abdomen. 

 

Rita shrieked, her high, keening wail drawing neighbors from their homes. Rick, his back pains forgotten, ran for his Ruger P89, and loaded it with practiced efficiency. From room to room he traveled, gun extended, sweeping his gaze left to right. But he found no intruder, not in the bathroom, bedroom or garage. He checked closets, under the bed, and even in the tub, but the butchers had absconded.

 

At last, he gave up and called the police. “Don’t bother with the body bag,” he told the call-taker. “You’d do far better with a mop.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as rain washed away roof grime, and thunder sent canines to cowering, Douglas stood before an open refrigerator, hands clenched at his sides. Since Emmett’s departure, he’d paced the house relentlessly, seething with silent rage. Desperate to leave, but with nowhere to go, he’d muttered for hours, wanting to break plates and kick holes into the walls. 

 

His aimless aggression had left him parched, with dried-out lips and an arid throat. Reaching for a water bottle, Douglas blinked, and the fridge’s interior shifted. Where fresh food and beverages had been, mold reigned supreme. Leftover hot dogs sprouted white fuzz. Bread, carrots, and deli chicken drowned in phosphorescent blue mold. In its carton, the milk had turned lumpy yellow. 

 

Another blink erased the fungi. Quickly, Douglas snatched a water bottle and slammed the door shut, lest their sustenance once more shift to spoiled.

 

He chugged the entire bottle in three gulps, and then perambulated until he had to urinate. After voiding his bladder, he washed his hands, staring into polished mirror glass.   

 

“I know you’re there,” he said, “one of you bastards. Why don’t you show yourself, you fuckin’ pervert? Do you get off on watching young boys pissing, or what?”

 

There was no reaction. “Show yourself!” Douglas screamed. 

 

His reflection dissolved, revealing an old woman: a balding crone smiling with rotted teeth, a quarter-sized mole bulging from her cheek. Her rheumy eyes glistened with morbid merriment. 

 

“You think that’s funny, you old bitch? You think I’m funny? Well, how do you like this?”

 

Douglas struck the mirror, cracking its surface into a spider web. He battered it until the crone’s face shattered, and blood gushed from his lacerated fist. Even fragmented, her displaced mouth grinned; still her amputated eyes twinkled. 

 

Douglas stood there panting, cradling his wounded hand. He felt the bathroom growing frigid.

 

Suddenly, he was upended, pulled to the ceiling. Blood rushed to his head, as he struggled in empty air. Déjà vu brought him memories of a porcelain mask. 

 

“Is that you, you fucked-up hag? Was the face in the mirror yours, before it got all burnt?”

 

As Douglas’ blood splattered the tile, a familiar whisper sounded: *“Not my face, no, but a reflection of one I hold within me.”*  

 

“Why are you bothering me again? Wasn’t this day bad enough?”

 

*“I’m here as your teacher, boy, to demonstrate your helplessness. You are just a marionette, Douglas. Always, I hold your strings.”*

 

Douglas snickered. “If I’m so insignificant, then how come you’re stalking me? I’m the one keeping you here; I’m the one propping the Phantom Cabinet open. We both know you can’t kill me, not if you want to stick around.” 

 

The entity said nothing. Instead, every door, drawer, and cupboard in the house burst open. Every window shattered outward, sprinkling glass across the lawn and back patio. Douglas, yet upended, found himself yanked outside, into the howling night. 

 

Soaked by the frigid downpour, he watched the ground grow increasingly distant. Cars shrank to the size of insects, homes to the size of matchbooks. Still he ascended, thousands of feet above sea level and rising. 

 

*“You pretend that death is the worst of all fates,”* the hideous voice murmured in his ear. *“Should you choose to oppose me, life will prove far more oppressive.”*

 

“I hate you!” Douglas screamed. Over 20,000 feet above sea level, his thoughts were rapidly losing coherence. Lightning flashed from all angles, illuminating the city miles below. 

 

25,000 feet above sea level, hypoxia hit, and Douglas fell unconscious. He awoke some time later, soaked and sneezing upon his sodden front lawn. The ground felt unsteady, ready to fall out from under him. 

 

Thunder boomed cannon-like, followed by a violent lightning burst. The electrostatic discharge expanded into a giant white oval, unmarked save for two eye hollows. It filled the sky, eclipsing stars and comets, silently appraising the shivering child. In the depths of his despair, Douglas glared right back.       ",1,1767708069.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

Merriment that would ordinarily provoke no discomfort becomes a disturbing portent, forecasting a brush with the uncanny. 

 

Margo Hellenberg sat in her Hilltop Middle School classroom, her hands in constant motion—cutting construction paper, coloring poster board—designing a game for her seventh grade special education class. Once completed, the board would provide a lesson on synonyms and antonyms. She’d give her students one word at a time, which they’d attach to the poster board, under “Synonym” or “Antonym”, using Fun-Tak. 

 

Without her pupils, the classroom was a lonely place. Still, she often stayed late into the night, as she had no husband and no family in the area. She didn’t date or socialize, barely even watched TV. Stated simply, her job was her life. 

 

Ms. Hellenberg had one of *those* faces, equally innocent and ancient. She could have been thirty or seventy-five, but had actually survived for forty-six summers. Her clothing was drab, her makeup sparse. Her tight ponytail emphasized a severe widow’s peak.     

 

When the giggle sounded, all concerns fell away. The hilarity was young and asexual, a high-pitched titter of no immediate origin. 

 

“Hello?” Margo gasped. “Where are you? Who are you?”

 

In lieu of an answer, the laughter returned. With it came suppressed memories of Margo’s childhood, when everything about her—her clothes, her hair, even the way she talked—had earned only peer ridicule. It became an amalgamation of every chuckle at her expense, every snicker, decades of mockery manifested. 

 

“Stop it!” Margo cried. “Leave me alone, goddamn you!” 

 

She eyed the door, preparing for a freedom dash. It swung open of its own accord, then shut, then opened again. 

 

The lights went off, as the door slammed forcefully. The laughter grew deafening, threaded with inhuman tones. Overwhelmed, Margo fainted into merciful oblivion.

Carter cracked his bedroom window open, craving fresh air. There was something incongruous about the next-door residence, that of Angus Capovilla and Walter Sanborn.

 

Angus and Walter were both octogenarians, and were purportedly the best of friends. But to anyone observing their furtive, loving glances, it was obvious that they were far more than that. As the two generally kept to themselves, Carter was shocked to see a woman in their second-floor window. 

 

She pressed naked against the glass, built like a slab of beef. Unblinking, she glowered down at him, standing perfectly still, arms hanging limp at her sides.

 

Carter shivered under the woman’s scrutiny. Her physical features were supernaturally defined; from her sagging breasts and abdomen to her loose golden hair, it was as if she was standing right in front of him. He saw a bulbous nose framed by acne scars, set in a vacant face. Her pubic thatch was wild and untrimmed.       

 

*What does she want?* he wondered. *Why won’t she look somewhere else?*

 

If her intent was seduction, she’d failed miserably. Looking at her was like glimpsing an elderly relative in the shower, a shameful and embarrassing sight. With her constant stillness, she could have been a wax museum sculpture. Perhaps she was mentally disabled, or experiencing a break from reality. 

 

Their uncomfortable eye contact continued, drawn out for what seemed an eternity. Carter felt trapped by her gaze, like a deer facing Mack truck headlights. 

 

“Hey, Dad, guess what?” Douglas called from the hallway. “*Battle Beyond the Stars* is on! Do you wanna come watch it?”

 

With that, the spell was broken. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Resisting the ravenous drag of expatriate souls, Commander Gordon manifested. From Douglas’ living room he drifted, passing through walls and fence, seeking the home next-door. 

 

In the geriatrics’ shared bedroom, he beheld a wide, cellulite-stippled backside, which he’d last glimpsed inside a doomed orbiter. *“Melanie Sarnoff,”* he greeted. *“Looks like I’m not the only crewmember to make it back.”*

 

The specter gave no response. 

 

“*Melanie, I know you can hear me. Turn around so we can talk.”*

 

She turned slowly.  

 

*“Commander Gordon…is that really you?”*

 

*“It’s me, sweetheart. Even death couldn’t keep me down. Speaking of death, how are you handling yours?”*

 

*“Oh…well, you shouldn’t worry about me. I’m just tired, is all, and having a hard time remembering things. What were we doing on the Conundrum, Commander? What was the point of it all?”*

 

Choosing his words carefully, Gordon answered, *“We were chasing a phantom transmission, my dear, from somewhere in outer space. The rest is a blur. I think that the Phantom Cabinet fragmented our memories, leaving us incomplete. I’ve been doing some detective work, though, with the help of some other spirits. The launch involved secret politics, they tell me, stretching all the way to the White House.”*  

 

*“Maybe it’s best not to know,”* Melanie replied. *“Sometimes the truth is just too much. But, it’s like…what do we do now? I’m so confused.”*

 

Gordon scratched his chin. *“Well, you can stand here until the sun burns out, or you can return to the Phantom Cabinet and dissolve into the next generation of souls. I’d recommend the latter.”*

 

*“And you, Commander? What keeps you here?”*

 

He pointed at the Stanton home.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

In his dream, Douglas walked alone, traversing a slender hallway. The walls flaked yellow paint onto a torn, stained carpet. Along them, moldy wainscoting trailed. Something was chasing Douglas, its identity a mystery. 

 

Douglas pressed forward intently, accelerating to a full-blown sprint. Following the hall’s twisted path, he turned left and right, encountering neither door nor window. The ceiling pressed downward, its stucco bumps sprouting into jagged stalactites, dripping milky fluid.  

 

Finally, when he was ready to let the unknown pursuer claim him, the hall dead-ended. Skidding to a stop, he encountered a giant mirror. On the mirror’s surface floated a giant porcelain mask—a mask instantly recognizable—enlarged to elephantine proportions. 

 

The mask slowly descended, seemingly of its own accord, unveiling a hidden countenance an inch at a time. The revealed face was Douglas’ own, much magnified. His mirror doppelganger radiated pure hatred.

 

Unable to cope with the sight, he bashed his fist against the glass. The mirror shattered, and Douglas’ dream voyage followed suit. He awoke to the sound of his own screams. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“What’s up, Douglas? This is Emmett. Sorry we haven’t hung out since the bonfire. I’ve been spending a lot of time with Etta lately.”

 

“Yeah, I’ve noticed. You guys are like a couple of Siamese twins, like you’re actually growing into each other.”

 

“You’re weird. I mean, who says shit like that? Aw, it doesn’t matter. The reason I’m calling is to see if you’re going to the dance. Etta and I are going, and we’re trying to get a group together.”

 

“What, people don’t ignore me enough at school? They gotta ignore me to music now?”

 

“Christ, bro, could you feel any sorrier for yourself?”

 

“I’ll never know until I try. Still, I say that there’s no way in Hell you’ll see me at that dance.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, when Friday rolled around, Douglas found himself inside the school’s gymnasium, watching his classmates awkwardly shuffling.

 

The dance had a tropical theme, which he’d been entirely unaware of. Blue and green metallic streamers hung from the walls, poorly attempting to mimic an ocean’s shimmering surface. Upon the streamers, construction paper starfish and palm trees had been stapled. 

 

At the head of the gym stood a DJ, wearing an oversized straw hat and a puka shell necklace. Atop a raised platform, he spun recent pop hits on polished Technics turntables. The man looked bored out of his mind, and possibly stoned, but the music skipped not a beat. 

 

Douglas’ male classmates wore Hawaiian shirts and swim trunks. Some even sported sandals, which led to foot trampling during slow ballads. Girls wore flowers in their hair, hula skirts, and white cover-up dresses. Douglas wore the same thing he’d worn to school that day: torn jeans and a faded Polo shirt. 

 

Teachers wandered between the dancers, attempting to keep the kids from grinding. The way that some students were going at it, it seemed that Oceanside’s strip clubs would be well stocked in forthcoming years. Another teacher— mustached math instructor, Mr. Wilkens—danced dangerously close to a cluster of girls, “accidently” bumping against them again and again. His predatory grin and sickly gleaming eyes were enough to make one shudder. 

 

Douglas stood in the back of the room, behind a table stocked with fruit punch, fruit slices and fruit snacks. He avoided eye contact with those around him, contemplating another Phantom Cabinet sojourn.  

 

After Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey” ended, Emmett came over and playfully punched Douglas’ shoulder.

 

“Douglas…” he said, drawing out the last syllable until the name lost all meaning. “I’m glad you made it, man. Fun dance, huh?”

 

Scrutinizing his friend, Douglas saw bright yellow Ray-Bans—hanging uselessly on a tie-dyed Croakie—and a neon green tank top, and knew that any criticism he could conjure would be summarily ignored. Instead, he nodded, endeavoring to appear less miserable. 

 

“Man, I’ve been dancin’ up a storm. My legs are so sore I’ll be rockin’ a wheelchair tomorrow. You gonna hit the dance floor, or what? I know standing around with your hands in your pockets is exhilarating and all, but getting up close with a female is even better.”

 

“Oh, I don’t know. The girls here don’t seem all that fond of me.”

 

“There you go again, always feelin’ sorry for yourself. Do you cry yourself to sleep every night? Is your tampon uncomfortable? Do you need the number of a good therapist? Can you feel—”

 

“Alright, enough of that. If I ask a girl to dance, will you shut the fuck up? I mean, seriously…”

 

“I just might, if she actually dances with you. Otherwise, you’ll have to keep trying until you strike gold.”

 

“Christ, we could be here all night. Remind me again, why do I let you talk me into these things?”

 

“That’s easy. My voice is so silky smooth that it’s impossible to ignore. How can the voices in your head compete?”

 

“You’d be surprised.”

 

Etta pranced over, her oversized gold earrings matching her sun top. She appeared so full of energy that she might vibrate through the floor. 

 

“There you are,” she said, lightly slapping Emmett’s arm. “I was wondering where you got off to. Did you forget about me?” As an afterthought, she added, “Oh…hi, Douglas.”

 

“Hi.”

 

“So, what are you two gentlemen talking about?”

 

“Douglas is going to ask a girl to dance.”

 

“Alright! That’s what I like to hear! Which girl caught your eye, Dougie? I can put in a good word.”     

 

Douglas mumbled, “No, that’s okay. I’m…evaluating my options.”

 

“Playing the field, huh? That’s respectable.” Grabbing Emmett’s hand, she dragged him back to the dance floor.

 

Reluctantly, Douglas scanned his surroundings, searching for an unoccupied female with a friendly face. Spying Starla Smith—hair pinned up, wearing a flowing floral print party dress—Douglas glanced away quickly. If forced to choose between asking Starla to dance and wearing sandpaper underpants for a week, he’d have chosen the underpants. 

 

Next, he spotted Karen Sakihama, swaying alone. He probably still reminded her of Benjy, Douglas figured. No way would she dance with him.

 

And then he saw her: a gangly girl, vaguely familiar, whom he’d likely passed in the hall many times without registering her presence. She was neither beautiful nor ugly, but could drift into either realm given time. She leaned against her own wall, clutching an empty plastic cup, staring at nothing in particular. The girl looked as miserable as Douglas felt. 

 

Her eyes were too close together, above a disproportionately large nose. Her dirty blonde hair was frizzy, in need of a brushing. Her posture was less than exemplary. Before Douglas knew what he was doing, he’d crossed the hardwood. 

 

Registering his presence, the girl’s azure eyes widened. “Hi…” she said awkwardly, looking anywhere but at Douglas.

 

“Hello there. I don’t mean to bother you, but I saw you standing here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.”

 

Her face reddened. “Yeah, a boy asked me to meet him, but he never showed up.”

 

“What a dick,” Douglas said with false sympathy. 

 

“I want to get out of here, but maybe he’s late or something. I don’t get asked out much, you know.”

 

“Sure… Oh, by the way, my name’s Douglas Stanton.”

 

“Sandra Olson. My friends call me Sandy.”

 

“Sandy Olson, I like it.”

 

“Who said you’re my friend?”

 

“Okay, Sandra then.”

 

“I’m kidding. Gosh, I suck at introductions. Maybe we should just dance.”

 

*Wow, that was simple*, Douglas thought, as he replied, “Hmm, that could be fun.”

 

Arms linked, they stepped amidst the dancers. It was just Douglas’ luck that the DJ chose that moment to play a slow tune, Aerosmith’s “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing.” Douglas hated both the song and the band passionately, but was in too deep to back out. 

 

Arms wrapped around each other, they shifted from left to right. Their cheeks were nearly touching, and Douglas’ palms grew uncomfortably sweaty. 

 

There was too much perfume and cologne in the air, forming a toxic cloud that made his eyes itch. He enjoyed the feel of a girl pressed against him, but the act of dancing seemed an archaic mating ritual. When the song finally ended, it came as a relief. 

 

Sandy drew away. “That was…fun,” she said. “Thank you, Douglas.”

 

“Don’t mention it.”

 

“You wanna dance again, next slow song?” she asked, as a neutered version of 2Pac and Dr. Dre’s “California Love” played in the background.

 

“I’d like to, but I told my dad I’d be home early. Maybe I’ll see you around school some time.”

 

“Maybe you will. See ya later, Douglas.”

 

“Bye.”

 

With that, he was gone, fleeing the gymnasium without a second glance. He’d hated lying to Sandra, sure, but an introvert’s school spirit only stretches so far. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The next morning, Emmett came to visit, smiling broadly under a Red Sox hat.

 

“What’s up, player?” he asked, playfully slapping Douglas’ shoulder, just a little too hard. “I saw you dancin’ last night, with a girl and everything. You ducked out before I could congratulate you, but nice work.”

 

“Thanks…I guess.”

 

Emmett pushed past Douglas, into the Stanton living room. Douglas had no choice but to follow.

 

“Hey, I’m making omelets,” Carter called from the kitchen. “You boys hungry?”

 

“Sure thing, Mr. Stanton,” Emmett responded. Then, in a subdued tone, he turned to Douglas and asked, “So, did you get her number? Should we set up a double date?”

 

“No dice.”

 

“You didn’t get the digits? Man, I swear there’s something wrong with you. Did you at least get her name?”

 

“Yeah, yeah. It’s Sandra Olson, a.k.a. Sandy.”

 

“Sandy Olson, I can work with that. Grab your phone for me, would ya?”

 

Douglas squinted, growing suspicious. “My phone? Who do you need to call?”

 

“Oh, I need to hit up Etta and ask her something.”

 

“Fine.” Douglas fetched the cordless. 

 

Emmett dialed a number from memory. “Hey, Etta, you know who this is? Yeah, it’s me. What up, baby girl? Yeah, last night was fun, wasn’t it? Actually, that’s why I’m calling. You remember when we saw my boy Douglas dancing? Remember that girl? Her name’s Sandy Olson. Oh, you do know her. You wouldn’t happen to have her phone number, would you? Hold on, let me get something to write with.”

 

Emmett made a scribbling motion, sign language for “grab me a fucking pencil.” Douglas shook his head no.

 

“You know what, Etta? Our pal Douglas is being a bitch right now. Just read me the number and I’ll try to remember it. Yeah, I got it. Sure, it was good talking to you, too. I’ll call you later, girl.”

 

As Emmett punched in the new number, Douglas raised his palms in supplication. “Really, you don’t have to do this. I’m not trying to be set up right now.”

 

“Hush up, son. You’ll thank me later.”

 

“Emmett, come on…”

 

Emmett held up a finger for silence. “Hello, is Sandy Olson there? Oh, this *is* Sandy. Hey, you don’t know me, but my name’s Emmett Wilson. I’m going out with Etta. Yeah, your history class study buddy. She says, ‘Hi,’ by the way. Anyhow, the reason I’m calling is to speak with you about our mutual friend. You know, *Douglas Stanton*. Douglas Stanton, the boy you were dancing with last night. Yeah, *him*.”

 

Douglas cringed, helpless in the face of well-intentioned meddling. He wanted to snatch the phone away and smash it against the wall, but the damage was already done. 

 

“Douglas had a lot of fun last night. In fact, he had so much fun that he wants to take you to dinner sometime, or maybe a movie. Why am I calling? Well, you see, Douglas is a shy dude. He’s a great guy when you get to know him, but sometimes he needs a little help in the socialization department. You know how it is. So…whatcha think? Are you down to spend more time with him?”

 

In a moment of supreme hatred, Douglas wished that his friend’s head would explode, in grisly replication of that famous *Scanners* scene. It didn’t, of course.

 

“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Let me know if you change your mind. Goodbye, Sandy. I’ll see you at school, I’m sure.”

 

Clicking the phone off, Emmett turned to Douglas. “I’m sorry, buddy,” he said consolingly. “I put in a good word for you, but she’s just not interested. We’ll find you a different girl, don’t worry.”

 

Carter ambled into the room, holding two plates of omelets. “Here you go, boys,” he said. “Eat right at the couch if you like.”

 

“Thanks, Mr. Stanton,” said Emmett, already digging into his eggs. “Ooh, this is good.”

 

Douglas’ hunger had abated, replaced by seething rage. In all his years of being bullied, he’d never felt so angry, like a coiled spring awaiting release. 

 

Eleven minutes later, after Carter left for work, Emmett considered Douglas’ untouched omelet. “If you’re not hungry, I could eat that,” he suggested. 

 

Douglas’ rage finally boiled over. “What the fuck was that?” he bellowed. “Did I ask you to call Sandy? Fuck no, I didn’t! You come here and embarrass me, and now you want my eggs? I’d rather throw them out!”

 

Emmett held up placating hands. “I wasn’t trying to embarrass you, man. If anything, I was trying to help you. I know we don’t hang out much anymore, so I thought I’d set you up with someone. It’s not healthy to sit by yourself all the time.”

 

“Now you want to tell me what’s healthy? Who the fuck do you think you are? You date one girl, *one girl*, and all of a sudden, you’re Mr. Know-It-All. Well, I got news for you. As far as I’m concerned, we stopped being friends the night Benjy died.”

 

Now Emmett grew angry. “You mean when you killed him, right? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Benjy was my best friend—since kindergarten, goddammit. Then you came along and caved his fucking skull in, smashed it like an old jack-o’-lantern. We should’ve never let you hang out with us!”

 

As simple as that, their friendship was irrevocably severed. They scowl-dueled for a few moments, and then Emmett barged out the door.

 

Dark clouds perched malignantly atop the horizon, harbingers of a coming storm. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Milo Black smiled at the blackening sky, his intentions far from noble. Standing in the well-kept backyard of his neighbors’ house, he discovered that the sliding glass door was unlocked. Wasting not a moment, he slid it open and stepped into the domicile of Rick and Rita Vaughn. 

 

Milo had drifted from Clark’s orbit. The sovereign bully had built himself a new friend circle, leaving Milo by the wayside. With hours of newfound free time, Milo had been forced to find new diversions. 

 

His parents weren’t wealthy, and couldn’t afford video games or movie outings. Hell, they didn’t even have cable television. What Milo did have, however, was a number of neighbors who left their homes vacant during the day. 

 

Some worked full time jobs; others ran errands for hours. So Milo had devised a little game for himself: sneaking into their homes and seeing what turned up. 

 

He didn’t consider himself a criminal, and so limited his home invasions to places with unlocked doors, or open windows he could crawl through. First, he’d wait for a vehicle to depart one of the surrounding residences. After ensuring that the coast was clear, he would creep his way over. He’d check every point of possible ingress, and vacate immediately when finding them locked. 

 

But sometimes the homes proved accessible. That was where the real fun began. Milo would explore drawers and cupboards, closets and attics. Sometimes, he’d discover money stashed away. Other times, he’d come across caches of pornography, cigarettes or hard liquor. Those treasures found their way under his bed, to be enjoyed at leisure. 

 

When unearthing money, nudie magazines or adult substances, he would never steal the entire stash, so that the theft wouldn’t be immediately observed. Since he’d yet to see a patrol car in his area, he assumed that he’d been successful. 

 

While he enjoyed the stolen items, the real thrill came from being in someone else’s house without permission. When invited into a residence, a visitor sees exactly what the homeowner wishes them to see. Certain rooms may be off limits, indefensible objects will have been stashed away, and some manner of cleaning will have gone down just prior. Only through secret entry can one see a home’s natural state, with all of its dirt and blemishes. One can learn a lot about its owner that way. 

 

For instance, Milo had recently entered the Bavitz residence. Their walls were adorned with photos of their children and grandchildren; their coffee table proudly displayed the latest issues of *Better Homes and Gardens* and *Variety*. In the couple’s bedroom, however, Milo chanced upon quite a scene. Upon cum-stained bed sheets, a cornucopia of bondage gear had been arrayed: slave harnesses, zippered facemasks, whips and restraints—all of black leather. Likewise, their dresser drawers had been filled with incongruous outfits: postman, Catholic priest, cheerleader, Boy Scout, nurse, schoolgirl, and what appeared to be an adult-sized Cabbage Patch Kid outfit, complete with a pigtailed wig. It had been quite the eye-opening experience. 

 

Over the course of Milo’s excursions, he’d sampled refrigerated leftovers, strummed acoustic guitars, and even sniffed the unwashed panties of Shawna, his attractive teenage neighbor. Occasionally, in his more malicious moods, he’d left things behind: dead rodents, rotted fruit, sometimes even a urine puddle in the back of a closet. Of what possessed him to do these things, Milo had no idea. He’d never been one for psychoanalysis.   

 

It was his first time in the Vaughn residence. He didn’t know what he’d find there, but his mind swam with possibilities. Maybe they kept a room filled with exotic snakes, or a chest stuffed with vintage Spanish coins. Maybe they had a homeless man in a cage. 

 

The kitchen was unremarkable: white orchid wallpaper, dishes stacked carefully in the sink, a small oak table. The refrigerator was filled with health food, none of which looked appealing. There wasn’t a drop of liquor in sight. 

 

Bored, Milo moved into the living room, finding a large television perched atop a hardwood stand. Within the stand, there was a VCR, flanked by videocassettes, mostly boring historical dramas. Perhaps he’d have better luck in the Vaughns’ bedroom. 

 

Before he could leave the living room, something caught his attention. There was someone on the white leather couch, which had been empty just seconds before. There was a man there, staring with unblinking, bloodshot eyes. His hair was long and grey; his attire consisted of long underwear and a flannel shirt. Most disturbing was the fact that he had no lower jaw, leaving exposed tendons clearly visible. Where the lower mandible should’ve been, a yawning chasm gushed blood over a shredded, lolling tongue. The blood evaporated in thin air, leaving the couch unblemished. 

 

“Uh…sorry,” Milo muttered. He backed away from the man, who just sat there, unmoving. Milo wasn’t sure if the guy was alive or dead, and had no desire to find out. 

 

Seeking the sliding glass door, he beheld a fresh arrival. She was of obvious African descent, a wiry old broad, her hair tied up in a scarf. Carved animal bones were her bracelets and earrings. Her flowing red dress trailed down to simple leather sandals. An albino python was draped over her shoulders. Over her face, a skull design had been painted. 

 

*“What brings you here, my boy?*” the woman asked, stepping forward as her serpent flicked its tongue. *“Unburden yourself for Auntie Marie.”*

 

“I…I have to go.”

 

*“Don’t be unsociable, child. You haven’t even met my companion.”*

 

“Companion? You mean your snake? Listen, I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m not getting any closer to it.” He was perspiring heavily, beginning to hyperventilate. 

 

*“I speak not of the python, child. I’m referring to my servant, standing just behind you. Step forward, Santiago.”*

 

Milo turned and screamed. There was a grey dwarf, standing scarcely more than two feet high, naked and completely hairless. The dwarf’s arms had been cut off at the elbow, with the forearms of a giant sewn on in their place. The limp, useless limbs dragged across the carpet as the strange little man advanced.  

 

Milo’s bladder let go, but he was beyond noticing. The living room filled with spectral figures, each eye blink revealing another. Milo saw a clown wearing a kelp wig, a mother breastfeeding an infant’s corpse. He saw Inuits, Nazis, Iraqis, and Romans staring hungrily, coveting his life spark. They surrounded him on all sides, as he revolved around and around, desperate for a getaway. 

 

Groped by disgruntled spirits, forgotten victims of a malicious world, Milo cried freely. His tears evoked no sympathy, not an ounce of respite. 

 

The gropes turned to scratches, which evolved into punches and kicks. Milo collapsed under the fusillade, attempting to curl into the fetal position. He beseeched his persecutors, pleading for mercy with each fleeting breath. But the dead offered no mercy. When Marie the voodoo priestess finally gouged Milo’s eyes out, it almost came as a relief.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

With one indifferent arm, Rick Vaughn ushered his wife into their residence. His back was acting up again, demanding three or four Advils. 

 

“That restaurant was terrible, don’t you think?” Rita asked, before answering her own question. “Sure it was. The waiter took *forever* to bring us our pasta, which wasn’t even warm. I’m telling you, it’s time to contact the Better Business Bureau. My stomach is so upset, I can barely concentrate.”

 

“You’re right, dear,” Rick replied. Personally, he’d found the food quite succulent, but knew that expressing a contradictory viewpoint would send his wife into hysterics. “Do you want me to grab you a couple of Tums?” 

 

“No, those things never work. Why don’t I lie down on the couch, and you can massage me for a while?”

 

“If that’s what you want, honey, I’d be happy to.”

 

In the living room, a disturbing tableau awaited. A child’s body, torn limb from limb, was spread from the couch to the closet, his pulped organs nestling in shallow crimson puddles. Contusions and fragmented bones were all that remained of his torso and face. A mass of intestines dangled from his slit abdomen. 

 

Rita shrieked, her high, keening wail drawing neighbors from their homes. Rick, his back pains forgotten, ran for his Ruger P89, and loaded it with practiced efficiency. From room to room he traveled, gun extended, sweeping his gaze left to right. But he found no intruder, not in the bathroom, bedroom or garage. He checked closets, under the bed, and even in the tub, but the butchers had absconded.

 

At last, he gave up and called the police. “Don’t bother with the body bag,” he told the call-taker. “You’d do far better with a mop.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as rain washed away roof grime, and thunder sent canines to cowering, Douglas stood before an open refrigerator, hands clenched at his sides. Since Emmett’s departure, he’d paced the house relentlessly, seething with silent rage. Desperate to leave, but with nowhere to go, he’d muttered for hours, wanting to break plates and kick holes into the walls. 

 

His aimless aggression had left him parched, with dried-out lips and an arid throat. Reaching for a water bottle, Douglas blinked, and the fridge’s interior shifted. Where fresh food and beverages had been, mold reigned supreme. Leftover hot dogs sprouted white fuzz. Bread, carrots, and deli chicken drowned in phosphorescent blue mold. In its carton, the milk had turned lumpy yellow. 

 

Another blink erased the fungi. Quickly, Douglas snatched a water bottle and slammed the door shut, lest their sustenance once more shift to spoiled.

 

He chugged the entire bottle in three gulps, and then perambulated until he had to urinate. After voiding his bladder, he washed his hands, staring into polished mirror glass.   

 

“I know you’re there,” he said, “one of you bastards. Why don’t you show yourself, you fuckin’ pervert? Do you get off on watching young boys pissing, or what?”

 

There was no reaction. “Show yourself!” Douglas screamed. 

 

His reflection dissolved, revealing an old woman: a balding crone smiling with rotted teeth, a quarter-sized mole bulging from her cheek. Her rheumy eyes glistened with morbid merriment. 

 

“You think that’s funny, you old bitch? You think I’m funny? Well, how do you like this?”

 

Douglas struck the mirror, cracking its surface into a spider web. He battered it until the crone’s face shattered, and blood gushed from his lacerated fist. Even fragmented, her displaced mouth grinned; still her amputated eyes twinkled. 

 

Douglas stood there panting, cradling his wounded hand. He felt the bathroom growing frigid.

 

Suddenly, he was upended, pulled to the ceiling. Blood rushed to his head, as he struggled in empty air. Déjà vu brought him memories of a porcelain mask. 

 

“Is that you, you fucked-up hag? Was the face in the mirror yours, before it got all burnt?”

 

As Douglas’ blood splattered the tile, a familiar whisper sounded: *“Not my face, no, but a reflection of one I hold within me.”*  

 

“Why are you bothering me again? Wasn’t this day bad enough?”

 

*“I’m here as your teacher, boy, to demonstrate your helplessness. You are just a marionette, Douglas. Always, I hold your strings.”*

 

Douglas snickered. “If I’m so insignificant, then how come you’re stalking me? I’m the one keeping you here; I’m the one propping the Phantom Cabinet open. We both know you can’t kill me, not if you want to stick around.” 

 

The entity said nothing. Instead, every door, drawer, and cupboard in the house burst open. Every window shattered outward, sprinkling glass across the lawn and back patio. Douglas, yet upended, found himself yanked outside, into the howling night. 

 

Soaked by the frigid downpour, he watched the ground grow increasingly distant. Cars shrank to the size of insects, homes to the size of matchbooks. Still he ascended, thousands of feet above sea level and rising. 

 

*“You pretend that death is the worst of all fates,”* the hideous voice murmured in his ear. *“Should you choose to oppose me, life will prove far more oppressive.”*

 

“I hate you!” Douglas screamed. Over 20,000 feet above sea level, his thoughts were rapidly losing coherence. Lightning flashed from all angles, illuminating the city miles below. 

 

25,000 feet above sea level, hypoxia hit, and Douglas fell unconscious. He awoke some time later, soaked and sneezing upon his sodden front lawn. The ground felt unsteady, ready to fall out from under him. 

 

Thunder boomed cannon-like, followed by a violent lightning burst. The electrostatic discharge expanded into a giant white oval, unmarked save for two eye hollows. It filled the sky, eclipsing stars and comets, silently appraising the shivering child. In the depths of his despair, Douglas glared right back.       ",1,1767708039.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Seeing how the people live over here compared to the U.S is something of a dream; a relaxed fantasy where the pressures of everyday life aren't felt or seen.

People who work in coffee shops seem fulfilled, not needing to convert their off hours into a second income. Their hard exterior can be broken easily with a simple ""Hello"" or ""How are you"" showing that the rejection I feel in the states seem native to that land...

But I return in 8 days. I have no plan. No place to go to, no job lined up, not much more money saved... a little background...

I moved out here to live with my long-distance girlfriend for a while. We have done this for a couple years and wanted to spend more than a week or two at a time together. And it has brought us closer. Being here, though, I had to go through more money than I initially thought. She needed help with her rent, and I was happy to help her how I could. But that was an extra amount I did not account for so now I am scrambling a bit. 

I know everything will work out, I can feel it. I have been here before, slept in my car on the streets of LA, even bounced around on a couple of friends couches...

But I want to do more than this, have more and be more. I am looking for a bit of luck, a little bit of grace when it comes to that. Because I felt like everything was working out and now, I think I am going to be struggling here for the next couple of months. 

I had a great job before I left, in an established profession in SoCal that gave me a bit of notoriety in town. I want to keep that status, meaning I want to work another job where I can wear a suit every day and connect with people who can create a difference in others life.

I guess I am just ranting, seeing if anyone else made a ""mistake"" recently...I guess it's not a mistake because I wouldn't have changed this time I spent in a foreign land with a girl I am in love with.

So...has anyone else felt this? This feeling of immediate uncertainty while knowing after the low the high will come back? Or does this not make any sense?

I have a 1zpresso jx pro that I bought when I was first getting into this hobby. Since, I’ve bought an electric for my espresso but still prefer to manually grind for my pour over. 

Now that I’m focusing on pour over with my manual, I’m getting a little bit of upgrade-itis. Is it worth getting a k-ultra or zp6? I know the jx pro was a little more espresso focused, but it still makes a pretty good pour over. 

Doing a little forum research, it seems like people generally prefer the k ultra as the more mass appeal grinder, while the zp6 is more niche. But will I notice enough of a difference between the jx pro and k ultra to warrant the purchase? Would you get the zp6 to get more of a contrasting taste? Or is my jx pro totally adequate to produce a great cup of coffee for 90-95% of this forum’s taste buds, and getting a k ultra or zp6 is unnecessary?

I had a very awkward experience overseas a bit over a year ago. I'd never gotten a paid massage before but my wife's family insisted we all get one at this fancy resort we stayed at one night and after that I was instantly hooked. We ended up getting a few more before we came home (but I haven't gotten one here since coz they're too expensive in the west). But while out on a morning walk by myself in a new area we were staying in I saw a comfy looking place right on the main road and thought my calves could use a rub down, being sore from all the walking and swimming. Inside and out had kind of an alpine design with exposed timber beams, very odd for this part of the world. Inside there were crystals and native American dream catchers, actual incense burning (in the west we all seem to have switched to diffusers) and relaxing music and nature sounds played on speakers throughout the building.

Everything seemed normal at first and the near hour passed okay, but the massage didn't feel as good as the previous ones. She just wasn't able to get the same amount of pressure. But in the last little but she told me to roll over on my back. This was only like my third massage but the first 2 were unique to each other so I just thought nothing of it. Now she parted my legs a little and ran up the insides of my thighs. I now know what people mean when they talk about freezing. I just waited for it to be over when she asked in broken English ""extra services, sir?"" while lingering near my groin, and the fingers of one hand just slightly went up under my boxers and brushed against my balls. I was pitching a tent but was just trying to not think about that. I also tried to pretend not to understand what she was saying for a few more seconds of exchange, hoping to bluff my way out of the situation. But then she just asked in what seemed like slightly clearer English ""do you wanna cum?"". I just sat up panicking and saying ""No no no, that's okay"" like I was turning down a cup of tea or coffee hahaha. I put my clothes on so fucking quickly and then nearly slipped down the nice polished wooden stairs on my way to the front door and lobby. I gave a pretty big note expecting change but she said something about not having change. I knew immediately she was trying to keep the whole note as a tip which would have been like an extra 30-40%. At this point I actually got more mad than embarrassed since the massage wasn't even that good and I also didn't get any ""extra services"", and we struggled to communicate for a bit about change until she huffily gave me the correct change but almost entirely in coins (malicious compliance lol).

I got the hell out of there feeling like an idiot but proud of myself for not being tempted. But then I needed a drink coz my mouth was dry... and I couldn't find my wallet in my pockets or my backpack. I had to go all the way back there and ask if I could check the room. No wallet there either. I could tell from her body language and manner of speaking that she had nothing to hide. So I put my backpack down in their foyer and rifled through it more thoroughly this time. Being black, it was just camouflaged against the bottom of the bag. I was so fucking humiliated that I sheepishly grabbed it, pulled out another note and gave her a tip for all the trouble. But I was also glad that I went back now because I said ""Sorry. I just wanted normal massage. I have a wife"" as she looked at me like an alien, then I booked it for the door. This still makes me cringe to think about. Once we got back home from that trip I was wondering if the humiliation had subsided enough to tell my missus what happened. At a loss, I asked ChatGPT and laid the whole thing out in great detail. The reply actually made a lot of sense. It said that if genuinely nothing happened then it probably wasn't worth exposing myself to shame a second time while also seeding unnecessary doubts in my wife's mind, especially since I didn't tell her immediately after it happened.

They shuffle their papers, they shrug, they say it’s all mystical.
They sip their safe coffee, they nod at the news,
They claim “politics isn’t me,” and they tighten their shoes.

But oh! Don’t you see? Don’t you know what I mean?
Politics is the air, the grass, the unseen machine!
It’s the food on your table, the roof overhead,
The cost of your meds, the dread in your bed.

You can’t just skip out, you can’t just abstain,
Like politics is some carnival ride you can disdain.
It shapes every city, every law, every rule,
Every hallway, every classroom, every jail, every school.

You say, “I don’t care, I hate politics, please!”
But politics knocks while you’re trimming your trees.
It decides if you live, if you work, if you eat,
If you’re safe on the street, or crushed under heat.

It’s the law that protects you, or tears you apart,
The system that blesses you, or breaks your heart.
So claiming apathy is just a thin, hollow lie,
It’s a blanket you pull over your face as life passes by.

Oh, the “I’m not political” dance is a waltz with a wall,
It’s pretending the hammer won’t fall after all.
When someone decides your rights, your money, your place,
You can’t hide in a closet, you can’t erase your face.

The sad truth is bitter, it stings and it bites:
Not being political doesn’t stop wrongs or rights.
It’s not a shield, it’s a pause, it’s a pretend,
While the world moves around you, beginning to end.

So next time you mumble, “I hate it, I won’t play,”
Remember the bills, the laws, the lives swept away.
Politics is everywhere, like air you can’t see,
Whether you want it or not, it shapes you and me.

No, you can’t opt out, you can’t close your eyes,
It’s life that’s political, the truth in disguise.
And if comfort is all that you crave or demand,
The world will still move, unheeding, unmanned.

So stop hiding behind the phrase so bland,
“I’m not political” it’s just denial’s hand.
And wake up, my friend, while the hours slip and spin,
Politics touches everything, whether you fight it or sink in.",1,1767707477.0,u_Carb0nFox,0,1.0,False

Isla  
  
  
Three days before the wedding, I practically floated into the bridal boutique, my heart racing with excitement.  
  
  
The gown was perfect—too perfect, maybe. Ivory silk cascaded down in perfect waves, hand-stitched lace climbing up the bodice like delicate frost on a windowpane. As the seamstress circled me with pins, adjusting the waist and smoothing the train, I couldn't stop staring at my reflection. This was it. This was really happening.  
  
  
I imagined Grant's face when he'd see me walking down the aisle in this dress. The way his eyes would light up, that crooked smile he always got when he was trying not to cry.  
  
  
God, I couldn't wait.  
  
  
""Beautiful,"" Lana, my stepmother, murmured from behind me, her voice soft. ""You look beautiful, Isla.""  
  
  
""Thanks, Mom!"" I beamed, practically bouncing on my toes. ""Can I—can I show Grant? Just a picture?""  
  
  
Her expression shifted, gentle but firm. ""No. You know the rules. It's bad luck for the groom to see the dress before the wedding.""  
  
  
""But it's three days away, not the day before,"" I protested, my voice edging into a whine. ""Come on, Mom. He's been asking about it nonstop. He'll be so excited—""  
  
  
""It's all bad luck,"" she cut in, folding her arms. ""You'll see him tomorrow at the rehearsal dinner. That's more than enough.""  
  
  
I wanted to argue, but I knew better. When Lana made up her mind, that was that. ""Okay... fine.""  
  
  
But inside, my excitement was already bubbling over. Grant would love this dress. He'd been asking about it for weeks, texting me at midnight with questions about the neckline, the veil, whether I'd gone with the cathedral train or the chapel length. He cared about the details. He cared about me.  
  
  
So when Lana left the boutique to take a call, I made my decision.  
  
  
I grabbed the garment bag, tossed it in the backseat of my car, and drove straight to Grant's apartment.  
  
  
Grant Easton and I met my sophomore year at a campus coffee shop during a downpour. I'd been juggling textbooks and a broken umbrella when he appeared out of nowhere, holding his jacket over my head like some kind of rom-com hero. He was a senior—confident, charming, the kind of guy who actually remembered what you said in casual conversation.  
  
  
We started as friends. Then late-night study sessions turned into dinner dates. His family owned a chain of luxury hotels. My dad, Jensen Bennett, ran a fashion empire—runway shows, magazine covers, the whole nine yards. On paper, we were a perfect match.  
  
  
When Grant proposed last spring on the terrace of his parents' flagship hotel, surrounded by string lights and champagne, I didn't hesitate. I said yes before he even finished the question.  
  
  
Now, three months later, I was standing outside his apartment with a wedding dress in my arms and a key he'd given me months ago. Use it whenever you want, he'd said. I love surprises.  
  
  
I slipped the key into the lock and stepped inside.  
  
  
The apartment was quiet. Too quiet.  
  
  
I set the garment bag on the couch and called out, ""Grant? Babe, you home?""  
  
  
Nothing.  
  
  
His shoes were by the door. His jacket draped over the armchair. He was home.  
  
  
I wandered down the hallway, my footsteps muffled by the thick carpet. That's when I noticed the trail—a red lace top near the bathroom door. A pair of heels tipped over on their sides. A bra dangling from the doorknob.  
  
  
I stopped, blinking.  
  
  
Elias, I thought immediately. Grant's younger cousin had a habit of crashing here with whatever girl he was seeing that week. Rolling my eyes, I turned to leave—then froze.  
  
  
A sound drifted from the bedroom. Low. Breathy. Unmistakable.  
  
  
And then a voice—Grant's voice—rough and desperate:  
  
  
""Maren—""  
  
  
The world tilted.  
  
  
No.  
  
  
No, that wasn't possible.  
  
  
Maren. My stepsister. The one who'd disappeared four years ago after a massive fight with Mom. The one who'd blocked all of us and never looked back.  
  
  
My feet moved on their own, carrying me toward the half-open bedroom door.  
  
  
The room was dim, curtains drawn, but I could see enough.  
  
  
Grant was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair spilled across the pillow as he moved over her, his hands tangled in the sheets. ""God, Maren,"" he groaned, his voice thick and desperate.  
  
  
I couldn't breathe.  
  
  
Couldn't move.  
  
  
Couldn't think.  
  
  
My eyes locked onto the details like my brain was cataloging evidence: the glass of water on the nightstand, lipstick smudged on the rim. A small backpack in the corner with a keychain shaped like a cartoon rabbit—Maren's favorite.  
  
  
My hand flew to my mouth, trapping the gasp in my throat.  
  
  
This wasn't a mistake. Not a drunk accident.  
  
  
They cheated on me.  
  
  
I stumbled backward, the hallway stretching impossibly long. My chest felt like it was caving in, ribs cracking under the weight of something I couldn't name yet.  
  
  
Betrayal? Rage? Grief?  
  
  
All of it. None of it.  
  
  
I made it to the elevator, my vision blurring with tears. The doors slid shut, and I caught my reflection in the mirrored wall—twenty-three years old, blonde hair stuck to my tear-streaked face, green eyes wide and shattered.  
  
  
I should've left.  
  
  
I should've driven home, locked myself in my room, and cried until I couldn't feel anything.  
  
  
But I turned around, stepped back into the elevator, and hit the button for Grant's floor.  
  
  
My hands were shaking, but my decision was steady.  
  
  
They were going to answer for this.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Isla  
  
  
I stood frozen in the hallway, my heart hammering against my ribs.  
  
  
What the hell was I doing?  
  
  
I should leave. Walk away. Pretend I never saw anything.  
  
  
But the thought of bursting through that door and confronting them—God, I wanted to. I wanted to scream at them both, wanted to watch Grant's face go pale when he realized he'd been caught. I wanted to look Maren dead in the eye and say, ""You stole my fiancé, you backstabbing bitch.""  
  
  
But I knew better.  
  
  
Maren was a master manipulator. If I confronted her now, she'd flip the script in front of Dad, twist everything until I was the villain and she was the poor, misunderstood victim. She'd done it before—four years ago, when she'd left home in tears, making everyone believe I was the problem.  
  
  
Still, I needed to know. I needed to hear Grant say it. Did the last five years mean anything to him?  
  
  
I wiped my eyes, steadied my breathing, and crept closer to the bedroom door.  
  
  
Maren's voice drifted out, smooth and smug. ""You've kept it a secret for four years, babe. I'm so proud of you. I just wanted to finish college before we got married. I couldn't stand the thought of my sister having your kids.""  
  
  
Grant actually laughed. ""Isla's a fucking idiot. She's so in love with me, she doesn't notice shit. Manipulating her? Easy as hell.""  
  
  
The words hit me like a punch to the gut.  
  
  
Tears slid down my cheeks, silent and hot.  
  
  
""I'm just waiting for the divorce,"" Maren purred. ""Then we can finally start our business. I've been dreaming about it for years.""  
  
  
""Of course, baby,"" Grant said, his voice dripping with satisfaction. ""I'll divorce her in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to the husband. That's what her grandfather's will says. So it all comes to us. I just have to put up with her for one more month.""  
  
  
My hand flew to the wall, steadying myself as the world tilted.  
  
  
Twenty million.  
  
  
Everyone in my family knew about the inheritance. The conditions tied to my marriage. The timeline.  
  
  
Maren laughed, sharp and cruel. ""You're so smart, Grant Easton. Ugh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around like she's so special. The bitch has no idea her world's about to implode. Once she loses the inheritance, her dad'll probably cut her out of his will too.""  
  
  
Grant roared with laughter. ""You're evil, Maren. Just a few more weeks, and we'll have it all.""  
  
  
They'd planned this. Meticulously.  
  
  
Confronting them now would be the stupidest thing I could do.  
  
  
""Come here,"" Grant growled. ""Ride me, baby. Let's celebrate.""  
  
  
Celebrate my downfall?  
  
  
Fuck that.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone, hands shaking, and hit record.  
  
  
If I sent this to Dad, he'd cancel the wedding. He'd have to.  
  
  
""Oh God, Grant—"" Maren moaned, her voice breathy and obscene.  
  
  
My hands trembled so violently that the phone slipped from my grip, clattering onto the floor.  
  
  
Grant's head snapped toward the doorway, his eyes went wide.  
  
  
""Isla!""  
  
  
Maren twisted around, her face going pale. ""Shit!""  
  
  
I grabbed my phone and bolted.  
  
  
""Isla, wait!"" Grant shouted, scrambling out of bed. ""Isla, stop!""  
  
  
""Go to hell!"" I screamed, my fingers fumbling as I pulled up Dad's contact and attached the video.  
  
  
""Don't you dare send that—""  
  
  
""You deserve to be exposed, you piece of shit!""  
  
  
""Stop this, Isla!"" he roared, his voice cracking with desperation. ""No one else will marry you! Our marriage is written in stone!""  
  
  
""I'd rather die than marry you, you fucking cheater!""  
  
  
I hit send.  
  
  
Grant lunged for me, but I was already out the door. He stood there in the hallway, completely naked, watching me disappear. ""ISLA!""  
  
  
A few neighbors poked their heads out, eyes wide.  
  
  
Good. Let them see him. Let them see what kind of man he really was.  
  
  
I made it to my car, my hands still shaking as I gripped the steering wheel.  
  
  
The city lights blurred through my tears as I drove, my mind replaying their words on a loop.  
  
  
A secret for four years. Divorce in a month. Twenty million. Just one more month.  
  
  
I rubbed my chest, the ache there so sharp it felt physical.  
  
  
Did Lana know? Had she been in on it? Was that why she'd kept me away from Grant today—to give them time together?  
  
  
And Dad. If I called him right now and told him what I'd seen, would he even believe me?  
  
  
No. He wouldn't.  
  
  
That's why I'd sent the video.  
  
  
Dad loved me, but he'd always seen me as... difficult. Spoiled. An entitled brat.  
  
  
If I hadn't recorded them, Maren would've twisted the story, made herself the victim like she always did. And Grant? He'd have smiled and lied through his teeth, trapping me in a marriage that would've been a living hell.  
  
  
I thought back to four years ago, when Maren had stormed out of the house in tears, blaming me for everything.  
  
  
The tension had been unbearable for weeks. Dad had comforted Lana and Maren, leaving me out in the cold. Ever since that day, he'd treated me like I was one wrong move away from ruining everything. He scolded me constantly, all because of Maren's lies.  
  
  
I could still see her standing in the living room, tears streaming down her face, playing the victim perfectly. ""I'll always be a stepsister,"" she'd sobbed. ""I'll never be accepted by her."" Then she'd offered to leave so I could be ""comfortable.""  
  
  
Lana had cried too, silent and heartbroken, like Maren's sacrifice was tearing her apart.  
  
  
But the truth?  
  
  
The fight had started because I'd caught Maren with Lucas. I'd confessed my feelings for him just a week before.  
  
  
I'd walked in on them making out in his car, and when I confronted her, she'd just smiled. ""He never liked you anyway,"" she'd said, flipping her hair like it was nothing.  
  
  
Losing Lucas had hurt, but Maren's betrayal? That cut deeper.  
  
  
""You can have him,"" I'd told her, swallowing my feelings so she could be happy.  
  
  
But instead of being grateful, she'd gone home and spun a completely different story. She told our parents I'd kissed her boyfriend. That I hated her for being happy.  
  
  
Dad had believed her. He'd scolded me to be ""more accommodating.""  
  
  
And then Maren left for college, leaving me drowning in guilt I didn't deserve.  
  
  
That's when Grant stepped in. Lucas's friend. He'd comforted me, pursued me, made me feel seen again.  
  
  
And I'd fallen for him.  
  
  
But now I realized Maren had sunk her claws into Grant too.  
  
  
She'd taken everything from me.  
  
  
Again.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Isla  
  
  
I didn't know where I was going.  
  
  
After fleeing Grant's apartment, I'd just... driven. No destination in mind, just away. Away from the betrayal, away from the lies.  
  
  
When I finally looked up, I realized I'd parked outside Silvercrest Plaza, the most exclusive shopping complex in the city. A place packed with luxury brands and high-end boutiques. Its CEO, Sebastian Archwood—was almost as famous as the mall itself. A billionaire bachelor, notoriously private, impossible to pin down. People said he was arrogant. Beautiful. Women threw themselves at him, but he ignored them all.  
  
  
Not that I cared.  
  
  
I wandered inside, my legs moving on autopilot, and found myself in a quiet café tucked away from the main corridors. The scent of espresso and fresh pastries wrapped around me like a blanket. I ordered a cappuccino, sat by the window, and immediately started crying.  
  
  
God, I was a mess.  
  
  
I tried to stop, wiping my eyes with the back of my hand, but the tears kept coming. How the hell was I supposed to stop this wedding? Would Dad even believe the video? Should I just post it online and let the whole world see what kind of man Grant Easton really was?  
  
  
The café door swung open, and I froze.  
  
  
Lucas and Miles walked in—Grant's best friends.  
  
  
Lucas. The guy I'd had feelings for in high school, before Maren swooped in and stole him out from under me.  
  
  
I ducked my head, praying they wouldn't notice me. They slid into a booth two tables behind me, laughing like they didn't have a care in the world.  
  
  
""Isla's always been a fucking idiot,"" Lucas said, stirring his coffee. ""She never even realized Grant and Maren were together. Blind as hell. Anyway, Maren's back in town. She's crashing with me for a while.""  
  
  
Miles laughed, loud and obnoxious. ""Works out perfect, man. Grant played it smart after you fucked things up with her. Once he gets his hands on her inheritance, we're set. Contracts are already drawn up. The second the money hits, we sign. Our businesses finally take off. Just one more month till we're rid of the bitch.""  
  
  
They both cracked up.  
  
  
My hands tightened around my cup so hard I thought it might shatter.  
  
  
They were all in on it.  
  
  
Not just Grant and Maren. Lucas. Miles. All of them.  
  
  
My inheritance. My money. That's all I'd ever been to them.  
  
  
Rage burned through me, hot and blinding.  
  
  
I wanted to march over there and scream in their faces. I wanted to tell them I knew everything.  
  
  
I shoved my chair back and stood, slamming straight into someone.  
  
  
Strong hands caught me before I could fall.  
  
  
I looked up.  
  
  
And forgot how to breathe.  
  
  
The man standing in front of me was... unreal. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in a perfectly tailored charcoal suit. Sharp jawline, high cheekbones, dark eyes that looked almost too intense. His black hair was slightly tousled, like he'd just run his fingers through it. He looked like a king, a man who wasn't from this world.  
  
  
The café went silent.  
  
  
Everyone was staring.  
  
  
And suddenly, a wild, reckless idea hit me.  
  
  
I glanced over my shoulder at Lucas and Miles, then back at the stranger.  
  
  
Before I could talk myself out of it, I kissed him.  
  
  
A low growl rumbled in his chest. His hand shot to my waist, pulling me flush against him.  
  
  
I stiffened in shock, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw Lucas and Miles gaping at us. The whole café was watching.  
  
  
The kiss was brief, just enough to make a scene.  
  
  
I pulled back slightly, my lips still brushing his, and whispered, ""Please. Just... go along with this.""  
  
  
He didn't push me away.  
  
  
Instead, his grip on my waist tightened, and he kissed me back.  
  
  
Harder. Deeper.  
  
  
I forgot why I'd started this. My knees went weak, and I clutched his shirt just to stay upright.  
  
  
When we finally broke apart, the café was dead silent.  
  
  
My lips were tingling. My face was on fire. I felt like I'd just been struck by lightning.  
  
  
But Lucas and Miles had seen everything. They'd definitely tell Grant. Or Dad.  
  
  
If the video didn't work, maybe this would.  
  
  
""Could you... walk out with me?"" I whispered, my voice shaky. ""I need them to see.""  
  
  
I glanced back at Lucas and Miles, who were still frozen in shock.  
  
  
His dark eyes locked onto mine. ""Do you want me to make them disappear?""  
  
  
I blinked. Was he serious? Was he some kind of mafia boss?  
  
  
""N-no!""  
  
  
Without another word, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward the door.  
  
  
I looked back. Lucas and Miles were scrambling out of their booth, chasing after us.  
  
  
Panic surged through me. I pressed closer to the stranger and whispered urgently, ""Please. Help me. Hide me just for a few hours. I can't—I can't deal with them right now.""  
  
  
His gaze darkened. ""You shouldn't trust strangers.""  
  
  
I hesitated, my breath catching.  
  
  
Then his expression softened. ""But I'll help you.""  
  
  
For some reason, I believed him.  
  
  
He led me down a side hallway I hadn't even noticed before. At the end was a private elevator, hidden behind sleek mirrored doors. He pressed his palm against a panel, and the doors slid open silently.  
  
  
I glanced back. Lucas and Miles were closing in.  
  
  
The man pulled me inside, his hand still wrapped around my wrist. The doors shut, cutting off the noise of the café.  
  
  
My heart was pounding.  
  
  
""Where are we going?"" I whispered.  
  
  
He turned his head slightly, his dark eyes burning into mine.  
  
  
""My penthouse. You'll be safe there.""  
  
  
The whole day had been chaos, and yet, something about him felt like a lifeline. And I...trusted him.  
  
  
Maybe I was insane.  
  
  
Or maybe, for the first time today, I'd finally done something right.

1q5j194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1q5j194/the_screen/,The Screen,"**My first attempt at a short story..**

It was a brick house in the middle of a town with narrow alleyways. Boys and men gathered around a living space on the floor, their knees touching. Here, physical proximity among the same gender is commonplace. Knees touch without ceremony; other forms of closeness require negotiation.

There was no clear indication of where I was, only that the men’s outfits resembled what I had seen Afghan men wear in the news: tunic shirts, loose pants, head coverings. I simply appeared there, with no memory of how it happened, only the familiar sensation of being foreign. It was not so different from how I had always felt, whether in male dominated physics classrooms in the United States or in living rooms back home where politics filled the air and I learned when to speak by watching who was already speaking.

A column stood in the middle of the room, its white paint faded from years of wear and tear, revealing patches of green and bare wood beneath. All eyes were fixed on a small color television, but I knew my body, leaning against the column, existed in everyone’s periphery.

Anxiety settled into my bones, not because anyone openly confronted me, but because I was acutely aware of my own existence. I felt the weight of occasional stares, caught fragments of low muttering that dispersed before I could understand their meaning. Nothing escalated, but nothing fully settled either.

I was aware of my age in the way one becomes aware of seniority without power. In my late thirties, I could still pass for someone ten years younger. I did not know whether my body registered first as a woman or as a complication. I only knew I had not yet reached the age where it became invisible.

The uncertainty made me careful. I adjusted my posture and my expressions, constantly measuring and calibrating so I would not accidentally invite a misreading.

Growing up in my neighborhood in an equally poor country, I learned early how to dull my own desirability. When men catcalled, my teenage logic told me that if I walked facing them sideways, what I believed to be my least flattering angle, I might escape notice. These were the small calculations I grew up making, the kind many women learn by habit: when to generate desire and when to shrink away from it.

The television flickered. The image was too small, too distant. Someone complained about the angle. Someone laughed at a joke I did not catch or understand; I could not tell. Dreams do not carry language perception the way reality does.

A Pakistani film was playing. The colors were subdued compared to the Indian films I knew better, the emotions restrained but effective. An actress appeared on the screen. She was poised and composed, her lips moving with deliberate economy, a sharp contrast to my own loud, effervescent presence, the one I was very busy containing that instant. Attractive, maybe, but no one would dare call me graceful. She felt familiar in the way celebrities often do.

“Sana Syed,” I said suddenly. “I know her.”

My first attempt at relatability. It seemed to work. Half the men glanced in my direction, mildly surprised. The rest remained glued to the screen.

I took a giant iPad from my backpack. It was giant in the way only dream objects are, slightly absurd and verging on impractical. Somehow, it was already tuned to the same channel. I held it up instinctively, not as a demand, but as an offering.

The men at the back stopped craning their necks. Eyes shifted between the television and my screen. Elbows loosened. The room adjusted.

As time passed, the iPad seemed to shrink. Or perhaps the hierarchy did. No one strained for a view anymore. The softening was not limited to me; it rippled outward, changing how the men related to one another. I had not taken space. I had redistributed it.

Conversation continued around me, not quite with me, but no longer pressing uncomfortably against my edges.

I knew this role well.

I had played it countless times before, under better lighting, in ergonomic chairs, with worse coffee and men discussing baseball statistics as if they were scripture. The setting changed. The choreography did not. I was foreign, and yet, this scene was so familiar.

Nothing bad happened, not usually. That was the achievement.

I learned that spaces were rarely made for me. I learned to read rooms before they read me, to smooth edges before they cut, to offer tools, screens, explanations, anything that made my presence useful rather than disruptive.

Belonging, I learned, was not granted.

It was earned by making things easier for everyone else.",1,1767707252.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False
1q5j11x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q5j11x/aitah_for_telling_my_partner_their_drinking/,"AITAH for telling my partner their drinking ""blowups"" aren't just stress, and I won't keep living like this","



I (31F) have been with my partner (33M) for a little over 2 years. Most of the time he's genuinely sweet and funny and we have a pretty calm life. The problem is alcohol. He doesn't drink every day, which is why I keep second-guessing myself, but when he does drink he flips into this mean, sharp version of himself and then acts like it was a one-off the next morning. It usually starts with ""just a couple"" on a Friday, then he gets louder, starts picking at little things, and by the time we're home he's looking for a fight. It's not physical, but he'll slam cabinets, talk over me, follow me room to room, and say cruel stuff he never says sober like I'm ""always trying to control the vibe"" or I'm ""so f ing miserable"" or he'll bring up personal things I told him in confidence and twist them. One night he yelled at me because I asked him to please stop telling the same story for the third time, then he got in the shower at 2am and left the water running and passed out on the bed soaking wet. In the morning he barely remembered it, said he was embarassed, promised he'd ""watch it"" and bought me coffee like that fixed it. It keeps happening though, maybe once or twice a month, and I feel myself living on this little calendar in my head of what nights are risky. I grew up with a parent who drank, so even if this is not the same scale, it hits me in my nervous system in a way I can't explain without sounding dramatic.



This weekend it happened again after we went out with friends. He had whiskey, got loud, then got weirdly jealous over nothing and started making snide comments in the car about how I ""act different"" around other people. When we got home he accused me of flirting, demanded I admit it, then said if I left the room it ""proved"" I was guilty. I ended up sleeping on the couch just to get away from the interrogation. In the morning he tried to cuddle like nothing happened and I snapped and said I can't do this anymore. I told him I love him, but the blowups after drinking aren't just ""stress"" or ""letting off steam"", it's a problem, and I'm done pretending it's normal because he can be nice the next day. I said I need him to either stop drinking (at least around me) or get real help figuring out why he turns into someone who hates me when he drinks, because I'm not staying in a relationship where I have to brace myself every few weeks. He got very cold and said I'm labeling him an alcoholic and trying to control him, that I'm punishing him for having fun, and that I'm ""projecting"" my childhood issues onto him. Now he's barely speaking to me except to say I was cruel and judgemental. AITAH for drawing a hard line and calling it a problem instead of treating it like a couple bad nights?

of ink and old paper  
bitter as black coffee sipped too long,

Across my desk they sprawl,  
envelopes brittle as moth wings,  
yellowed by attic damp

Stamps peel at the corners,  
curling inwards as  
as if they are trying to hide from something

The handwriting trembles  
the way autumn leaves tremble  
in the wind  
before letting go

I taste the salt of dried tears  
in every folded crease,  
a faint brine of sorrow  
soaked deep into the paper.
One envelope still holds  
the scent of rosewater perfume,  
clinging stubbornly,  
to remind me of you

Another carries the weight  
of unsent apologies,  
hurried confessions  
pressed between pages  
like flowers crushed  
in a book we never finished  
sealed with wax and regret

The convo started playful and flirty. She was responsive, teasing back, even suggested meeting. We talked about where we live, colleges, all that and the vibe felt mutual.

 We planned to meet the next day at a metro station, go to my college area, grab chai/coffee, she agreed. I asked for her number, moved to WhatsApp. Still normal, still fine.

Later that night she asks, “Wait, how tall are you?”
I said 5'5 and added “but does that even matter?”
She replied she’s 5'9.
I said, “That’s fine by me.”
Conversation basically died after that.

No fight, no argument, no explicit “no” just that subtle energy shift where you know it’s over.

1q5ix2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q5ix2x/ot_journal_struggling_in_a_few_waysbuti_have_faith/,[OT] JOURNAL - Struggling in a few ways...but...I have faith :),"I am living in Europe. I have been here for the past 3 months, and it has been amazing.

  
Seeing how the people live over here compared to the U.S is something of a dream; a relaxed fantasy where the pressures of everyday life aren't felt or seen.

People who work in coffee shops seem fulfilled, not needing to convert their off hours into a second income. Their hard exterior can be broken easily with a simple ""Hello"" or ""How are you"" showing that the rejection I feel in the states seem native to that land...

But I return in 8 days. I have no plan. No place to go to, no job lined up, not much more money saved... a little background...

I moved out here to live with my long-distance girlfriend for a while. We have done this for a couple years and wanted to spend more than a week or two at a time together. And it has brought us closer. Being here, though, I had to go through more money than I initially thought. She needed help with her rent, and I was happy to help her how I could. But that was an extra amount I did not account for so now I am scrambling a bit. 

I know everything will work out, I can feel it. I have been here before, slept in my car on the streets of LA, even bounced around on a couple of friends couches...

But I want to do more than this, have more and be more. I am looking for a bit of luck, a little bit of grace when it comes to that. Because I felt like everything was working out and now, I think I am going to be struggling here for the next couple of months. 

I had a great job before I left, in an established profession in SoCal that gave me a bit of notoriety in town. I want to keep that status, meaning I want to work another job where I can wear a suit every day and connect with people who can create a difference in others life.

I guess I am just ranting, seeing if anyone else made a ""mistake"" recently...I guess it's not a mistake because I wouldn't have changed this time I spent in a foreign land with a girl I am in love with.

So...has anyone else felt this? This feeling of immediate uncertainty while knowing after the low the high will come back? Or does this not make any sense?

When someone does something that others call cringe, it’s not actually cringe, it’s just a person doing what they want, what feels right to them.

I feel like people made up the idea of “cringe” just so they could say something bad about someone. It’s often the same people who sit around drinking coffee, gossiping, and judging other people’s choices. If you’re not going to say something nice, don’t say anything at all.

Posting on social media, trying something new, expressing yourself——> it’s not cringe.

Calling it cringe just shows that you’re not willing to put yourself out there or take a risk and maybe be awkward (oh no)…

So next time you think something is cringe… maybe it’s just life being lived, and that’s okay.

Life is messy, awkward, loud, and weird. That’s the point. Stop policing other people’s fun, their mistakes, their expression.

So is it really “cringe” or are you just someone being truly annoyed by someone else living their life?

Most students go into their final year facing the same paradox: You need a portfolio to get an internship, but you need an internship to build a portfolio. You end up applying to dozens of roles, only to be met with silence or, worse, a ""coffee-fetching"" role that doesn't actually teach you anything about marketing.

I recently wrote a guide specifically for students who want to break into Copywriting and Digital Marketing without that initial experience.

Here is the reality of the industry right now: Being a ""good writer"" isn't enough anymore. To get hired in 2026, you need to understand SEO, WordPress, and how to write for a global audience.

In this blog, I’ve broken down:

The ""Training-First"" Model: Why you should look for internships that prioritize learning over labor.

Portfolio Building: How to ensure you graduate with live, published links to your name.

Remote Flexibility: Tips on balancing a professional internship with your FYP and classes.

The E-E-A-T Factor: How to leverage a company's legacy like TAKO since 1979 to make your resume unignorable.

If you’re a final-year student feeling stuck, or if you’re just starting to explore the creative industry, I hope this provides a clear roadmap for your next steps

1q5ir8b,https://www.bigissue.com/opinion/benefits-welfare-dehumanising-narratives-change/,The dehumanising narratives around benefits need to stop in 2026 – for all our sakes,"Key points:

* The incredibly sharp hurt and harm that words can and do cause has been especially evident in the aftermath of the autumn budget at which the Labour government announced the full abolition of the cruel two-child limit.
* This policy, which arbitrarily caps support to means-tested social security to the first two children in a household, has caused real and lasting to the families it has affected since it was introduced by the then Conservative government in 2017.
* The words that were used in an effort to defend its introduction were both stigmatising and derogatory. Time and time again, David Cameron and George Osborne pitted family against family, and drew on sensationalised media coverage and content, which was recycled to present ‘welfare’ itself as part of the problem.
*  It was thus incredibly positive to see our current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, take to the dispatch box to announce the two-child limit’s abolition.
* So far, so positive. But then, in a hate-filled echoing of the austerity years, Kemi Badenoch delivered her scathing budget response, declaring to much of the media’s apparent delight that this was a ‘Benefits Street Budget’, returning to those unsustainable but seemingly popular binary divisions between those who work and those who don’t.
* The morning after the budget, we organised an informal coffee morning for Changing Realities, a collaboration of over 200 parents and carers on a low-income, researchers from the University of Glasgow and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Child Poverty Action Group. We have learned never to assume how parents will respond to government set pieces, but were completely unprepared for the level of fear, anger and sadness that dominated the discussion, and which was rooted in the pejorative and dehumanising narratives circulating about ‘welfare’. Yes, parents were pleased – delighted even – to look towards a future without the two-child limit. But this was tempered by their fear, and quite visceral reaction, to being confronted by the negative headlines and stigmatising portrayals.",4,1767706550.0,LabourUK,1,0.83,False

(a short philosophical attempt with a sense of humor)","Free will is like a sock that vanished in the washing machine of causality. We’re all sure we had it, we vaguely remember it being there somewhere, but when we go looking for it ontologically, all we find is a spinning drum of physics and chemistry.

Let’s start from the beginning - the Big Bang. Unlike us, it clearly didn’t have free will, because ever since then the universe has behaved with remarkable consistency. Particles collide, fields propagate, galaxies form - no electron ever says, “Today I don’t feel like orbiting the nucleus; I’m going to follow my heart.” Discipline. Causality. Iron necessity.

And then, after billions of years, this causality produces a human being who declares: “I am free.” The same human being, incidentally, who can’t stop thinking about pizza at 11:47 p.m. because their glucose level has dropped. But yes - free, as long as there’s Wi-Fi, coffee, and they’re not hungry.

Ontologically speaking, the human being is a complex nanomachine that makes decisions in much the same way a thermostat decides to turn on the heating - just with more existential drama. Neurons fire impulses, hormones flow, traumas from 2006 suddenly pop up in 2026 and ruin your mood. And you say, “I decided to be sad.” No. It happened to you causally.

The favorite argument for free will is: “But I deliberated!” Of course you did. Your brain simulated future scenarios using accumulated data, evolutionary hacks, and a bit of cultural software. That’s not freedom - that’s a well-optimized algorithm with a sense of guilt.

And when coercion comes up, everyone immediately pulls out the gun. “Well, if someone is threatening you with a gun, then you’re not free!” Great. But when you’re threatened by a serotonin deficit, cortisol, gut flora, and a childhood memory - then you are free? Just because there’s no metal object pointed at your head?

The truth is brutal, but also funny: we are fully causally imposed beings who have evolved language in order to explain why we are fully causally imposed beings. Free will is a label we stick onto complex causal processes so we can get through the day without falling into an existential crisis (which is itself causally imposed).",3,1767706452.0,freewill,8,0.8,False
1q5ip55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waiting_To_Wed/comments/1q5ip55/8_years_getting_really_sick_of_waiting/,8 years - Getting really sick of waiting.,"Since the beginning I’ve told myself “If I have to beg, bargain, or nag for it, then I don’t want it”. We (f27 & m31) just celebrated 8 years together. We’ve lived together for almost 5 years now and we’ve had a dog for 4 of those years. We’re both deeply committed, 100% in love, and very compatible. We take care of each other in sickness and health and all that other lovey dovey stuff. 

There have been several times where I was so sure he was about to propose and ended up feeling stupid. My birthday 2 years ago we went to this beautiful public garden, I got all dressed up - nothing. Our 7 year anniversary he gave me a ‘promise ring’ that for a second I thought might be the real deal.  (Yellow gold 3 stone ring with a (fake) emerald center stone that he got at an estate sale). This year for Christmas he got me a wooden carved sign that says “always & forever” which I happen to know is in the WEDDING section of a store I like. So close and still so far. 

I try not to bring up proposing too much because, again, if I have to force it I don’t want it. The few times I’ve mentioned it he’s said the main reason he hasn’t yet is money. Okay, totally fair, his job doesn’t pay much and he recently just got out of major credit card debt. He recently said he’s not ready to look for a new job because he does think this job is good for his mental health because of his coworkers and the freedom his job gives him. Totally understandable, no problem. But this weekend we were talking about New Year’s resolutions and he said he’s going to start saving money for a used Jeep. For reference, he is about 6 months in to a 3 year lease on his current car. So now I feel like:

1. I’m less important than a used Jeep

2. If this is EVER going to happen I’m going to have to wait at least 3 years now since this Jeep has evidently taken my place in line. 

I know this is a conversation that I’m going to have to have soon but I really don’t know how to do this. I don’t want to beg or force anything but I’m honestly hurt that I’m not a priority to him. Usually he spends most of his extra money on his hobbies and now that he finally is starting to focus on saving money, he chooses a car instead of the person who has been here 8 years now without question, supporting him through all kinds of problems, making him coffee every morning, dinner most nights, keeping our home clean, buying groceries, financially supporting this family, and, in his own words, the best sex he’s ever had. I don’t know what else I can do. If he doesn’t think I’m worth it at this point then I really don’t know what to do. I’m hurt and annoyed and sick of this.

* Loves animals and I find ways to feed strays or donate to a shelter
* Mahilig sa coffee, alcohol and tubig (of course)
* Drives around the city when bored and go on cafes to try out coffee lol (medyo adik na nga eh)
* Into video games as well, currently on PC and PS5. Malay mo we can play?
* Good listener and people say that I am empathetic, so share ka lang ng kwento mo hehe
* Loves to share memes and corny-ass jokes

My routine is having coffee/tea and a piece of toast with peanut butter. This holds me over so I can walk my dogs, get my baby up and get myself ready for the day. I'll use natural peanut butter sometimes but I usually use the Kraft kind with tons of sugar. I want to break this habit. I'm looking for small savory bite ideas that I can have with my coffee/tea. I'm ok with recipes that I can make ahead of time or things that require a little assembly in the morning (maybe as much as toasting bread and putting peanut butter on).

1q5ild4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5ild4,Particulate in Water [Gran Gaggia],"Hey all,

I recently found what seems to be a pretty vintage “Gran Gaggia” machine at a thrift store, that I thought could be a fun to try and clean/fix-up, but I’m currently hitting a wall that I’m unsure how to exactly tackle.

I ran through the routine maintenance steps for cleaning & descaling, using Cafiza as well as the Coffee Descaling solution from Bar Keepers Friend. Additionally, I did disassemble the machine to do a direct clean to the inside of the boiler - but alas, it seems like any water pulled from the machine brings with it a bunch of floating particulate in the water that I doubt is wise to drink. Images attached.

Beyond just continuing to try and run descale cycles, is there anything more direct that I can do to potentially resolve this?

Had an absolute nightmare yesterday morning. A spider charged at me, I leapt like I’d been tasered, and in the chaos I launched a freshly brewed cafetière of boiling coffee all over the kitchen floor. Great start to the day.

While mopping up with every tea towel I own and then breaking out the steamer, I lifted the back door mat and surprise! A much bigger spider was living its best life underneath. 😱

I’m pretty sure they came in through the kitchen window I usually leave cracked after cooking, but now I’m stuck on the far worse realisation: this was the first thing I saw in the morning. Which means I slept in the same house as them. I know some of you won’t get it, but this has fully grossed me out.

Current strategy is vacuuming them up while screaming like I’m in a low-budget horror film. Pretty sure the neighbours think I’ve lost the plot.

So… help? Any genuinely useful tips for dealing with this fear (or at least surviving spider season with some dignity)?",4,1767705935.0,LivingAlone,8,1.0,False

I let a stranger destroy me in a hotel room. Two days later, I walked into my internship and found him sitting behind the CEO's desk. Now I fetch coffee for the man who made me moan, and he acts like I’m the one who crossed a line.

My Fiction

The Dare

June

There’s something about cheap tequila and half a degree of confidence that makes me think I can get away with anything.

""Okay, June, your turn."" Leila waves her phone in my face. ""Truth or dare?""

I lean back against the velvet bar booth, head buzzing from the last round of drinks. We’re four girls deep into celebration, lipstick smudged, heels lost, and so drunk. So so drunk.

""I pick dare,"" I say, because of course I do.

Leila’s eyes light up. ""See that guy at the bar? The one in the dark gray suit, second stool from the end?""

I glance — and almost regret it.

Second stool from the end. Jacket undone, tie missing, shirt collar open just enough to see a sliver of chest. He’s got one hand wrapped around a tumbler of something dark, the other twitching on his knee like he’s trying to hold still. But his stillness is loud. Charged. Like a switch waiting to flip.

""Are you trying to get me killed?"" I ask, my brows furrowing.

Leila snorts. “He’s hot. And definitely older. You said you wanted to be bold tonight.""

""I also said I wanted to survive the night.""

""It’s just a number, June. Not a marriage proposal."" Kayla laughs, reapplying her lipstick.

I glance again.

His face is unreadable. Sharp jaw, cold mouth, eyes that don’t seem to be focused on anything at all. There’s something coiled in him, something fierce. Or maybe something barely held back.

Still, I can’t run away from a challenge. Especially not on a night like this, when I’ve just landed an internship at the biggest business enterprise in Las Vegas. When I feel electric and drunk and slightly untouchable.

""Fine,"" I agree, standing. ""But if he arrests me with his eyes, you better post bail.""

I walk up slowly, pretending my legs don’t feel like jelly and my stomach isn’t turning somersaults.

I slide into the seat next to him like I belong there with my chin high, eyes sparkling from the dare.

He doesn’t look at me right away. Just swirls the drink in his hand like he’s trying to hypnotize it.

""Hi,"" I wave, displaying my signature flirty smile. 

There is silence, then, a “No.” Flat, deep and dismissive.

My lips part, half a nervous laugh caught in my throat. ""I haven’t even asked anything yet.""

He turns, slowly. His eyes are sharp, gray, like metal under ice. He looks at me like he’s already exhausted by my existence, which, frankly, only makes me more interested.

He groans, ""You were going to ask for my number."" It’s not a question. It’s a psychic read.

My pulse skips two beats, ""So what if I was?""

He leans in, voice low and hot with whiskey and intent. ""Ask for a night instead.""

My eyes slightly widens. Not because I’m shocked. But because… I'm not.

This man is raw restraint, the kind of person who probably keeps an iron grip on everything until one thread snaps and it all unravels. And I wonder, maybe, if tonight’s that thread.

There’s no smirk. No flirtation. He means it. Every syllable feels like a dare. 

I am getting excited.

I should laugh. Or walk away. But there’s something about the way he looks at me, like he’s trying not to. Like I’ve already made something in him snap.

So I say, ""One night.""

His brow twitches like he didn’t expect me to agree.

I lean in. “What’s your name?”

He downs the rest of his drink. ""You don’t need it. Let's go."" He stands up and I follow.

I wave a goodbye laced with a victory smirk subtly at the girls, noting their surprised expression at my success. 

\*\*\*

It's a hotel.

Not far from the bar. Clean. Modern. Two blocks away, but a whole other world.

The staff hands him the key without a word. I don’t ask why. I already guess this man doesn’t do things that haven’t been planned ten steps in advance.

We don’t speak in the elevator. His jaw ticks, and I swear he’s grinding his teeth. Like he regrets this already. Like he’s angry with me, or himself, or the world.

Maybe all three.

Inside the room, the lights stay off. Just the faint city glow coming through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

He tosses his jacket over the chair, rolls his sleeves up to his forearms. Still not looking at me.

“Last chance to leave,” he says, his tone undetectable.

""Are you always this dramatic?"" 

He steps forward and I flinch, not in fear, just in anticipation.

""You’re not much of a talker, are you?"" I asked, trying to break the tension. I peeled off my coat, draped it over the arm of a sleek leather chair, and turned back to face him. “Or is this your thing? Brooding silence and expensive suits?""

The corner of his mouth tugged revealing not quite a smile. ""You always make jokes when you're nervous?""

""Only when the guy looks like he could ruin my life.""

His eyes sweeps down, slowly. Like a touch. ""Can I?""

I swallow. ""I guess I'm about to find out.""

His eyes locks on me like he’d already decided what he is going to do to me.

And maybe worse, like he already had.

So no warning. No buildup. One moment he was standing across from me, the next, he was in front of me — heat rolling off his body, one hand gripping the side of my throat, his cold thumb tilting my chin up.

Not choking as I except, more like claiming.

""Don't regret this,"" he murmurs on my mouth. ""You have no idea who I am.""

""That’s the point,” I whisper, shutting my eyes, as I wait for a kiss, but he didn’t kiss me.

Instead, he pushes me backward until I hit the wall. The impact is soft, but my breath catches anyway. His hands goes to my waist, firm and possessive, tugging me close until our hips are flush. I feel the hard line of him — already thick and straining beneath his trousers, pressed against my abdomen.

I inhale sharply. ""You're—""

""Don't say it,"" he growls, and for the first time, I feel something cracked in him. Not his mask, something deeper. Restraint.

He grabs the hem of my dress and yanks it up, bunching it around my hips. One hand slide between my thighs, cupping me over my panties — already fucking damp. Already unapologetically desperate.

""You’re soaking wet"" he mutters, his voice dark with something between approval and disbelief.

""Maybe I like the suspense,"" I breath, biting my lips.

He doesn't laugh. But he smiles, sharp and amused, before dragging my panties down and off in one rough pull.

He dropped to his knees. No teasing or romancing.

His tongue found me like he’d been craving it for days. Long, deep strokes that had me gasping and grabbing at his hair, my thighs shaking from the sheer force of it. He effortlessly wrapped one arm around my hip to keep me from falling and used the other to press two fingers inside me, slow at first, then hard, curling until my back hit the wall.

I came embarrassingly fast. Too fast. His name wasn’t even in my mouth. I had nothing to moan but a broken, breathless ""God.""

He stood as I came down from it, still fully dressed, towering over me like I was something he meant to devour.

""Take your dress off,"" he says, and I read it as a sexy order.

I quickly did.

My pink dress slid off my shoulders, pooling at my feet. I stood in just my bra, breathing hard, bare from the waist down, and suddenly shy. That wasn’t like me. I wasn’t a shy girl. I didn’t do shy. Maybe it was because it was my first official time.

Don't get me wrong, I'm no virgin, at least biologically. That, I took care of a long time. Myself. But this was going to be my first with someone and, God, I am in the 7th heaven.

He undid his belt slowly. Intentionally. Pulls his cock free and stroked it once, it is thick, hard, flushed dark with need.

My mouth go dry. My pussy. More damp. Sticky wet.

""Still want to find out if I’ll ruin your life?"" he asks.

""Only if you do it properly,"" I say, already reaching for him. He doesn't let me.

He spin me around, bending me over the bed.

No words. He gripped my hips, lined himself up, and pushed in with one, brutal thrust.

I cry out, in pain, in shock, in full pleasure. The fullness. The pressure. The way he held nothing back.

He curses under his breath, barely audible. ""You're tight.""

I couldn’t help it. I grinned, panting. ""Maybe you’re just huge.""

That got a real laugh from him. Low. Surprised. Almost boyish, then he growled — actually growled — and bottomed out inside me.

""Say it again,"" he rasped against my neck.

""You’re huge.""

""Say my name."" Came another full slam. 

""I...don’t know...it."" I moan loudly and unintentional.

He stilled, breathing harsh, forehead against the back of my shoulder. ""Exactly.""

He thrusts again. It wasn’t sweet. It wasn’t slow. It was filthy and perfect and everything I hadn’t known I needed. The way he fucking fucked me, hard, deep, possessive, like I was the only thing in the world keeping him alive. His hands gripped my hips tight enough to bruise, his body slamming into mine with primitive, desperate force.

And still — he never kissed me.

He didn’t even try.

Even when I turned my head to look at him, to maybe see him, he dragged my face back down and pressed it to the mattress.

""Don’t,"" he murmured. ""Just feel.""

So I did.

I came again with a sharp gasp, my fingers fisting the sheets, my whole body going taut and then liquid. He followed seconds later, pulsing inside me with a deep, low groan that sounded like it was ripped from his soul.

He collapsed beside me, one arm flung over his eyes.

I laid there in silence. My chest heaving. My heart racing. My mind going blank.

And still… no kiss.

When I woke, he was gone.

The sheets were cool. The bathroom door was open. His scent still lingered on the pillow beside mine, clean, masculine, expensive.

My panties were folded on the nightstand.

Beside them was a note, written in sharp, elegant handwriting.

Thank you for tonight. Don’t look for me.

— H.

No number. No name. Just an initial.

I held the note between my fingers for a long time, feeling my heart doing something weird and fluttery in my chest.

I didn’t know who he was.

Didn’t know what he did.

Didn’t know why he refused to kiss me.

But I knew one thing for sure. I was going to have a hard time trying to forget him.

Promoted to Secretary

June

Two days and twelve hours.

That's how long it's been since I did the thing I said I'll never do. Again which is: sleep with a stranger.

It's hard getting 'em off your mind when you're done with 'em.

I try not to think about it, I just shove it down where all my bad decisions lives. Rent-free. 

Because, I am here now... In front of my dream company — The building is so tall, it feels like it’s leaning over me.

Apex Corporation — A.C. in thirty-foot chrome letters, gleams above the entrance like it owns the sky. Which, technically, it might. The glass exterior mirrors everything: traffic, tourists, pedestrians, the massive LED screen that loops corporate ads like digital worship. But all I can see is my own face, small and wide-eyed.

I pause on the sidewalk and inhale. Once. Twice. Again. 

""Calm down, breathe."" I tell myself.

I clutch my leather folder tighter to my chest. It's the first day, a new start. Internship at the biggest enterprise in Las Vegas. It’s everything I worked for. Everything I need right now and the thing I can’t afford to screw up.

I swipe my newly acquired ID at the front security panel. It blinks green. It's game on.

The inside of Apex is whole different world. It's cold and lighting with breathtaking marble floors. People in neutral colored suits moving like blood through veins fast, efficient, and without hesitation. I already feel behind.

A woman with sleek black hair and an Apple headset greets me in the lobby. ""You’re June Pearl Alexander?""

""Yes,"" I reply, trying not to sound like I just stepped out of a dream.

She offers a tight smile. ""I’m Brenna. You’re assigned to the Strategy & Innovation team on Floor 39. Follow me.""

The elevator ride is fast. Very fast.

I smooth my hair in the reflection of the polished walls. It feels like everyone in this building knows something I don’t. Like they were born wearing pinstripes and I’m still figuring out how not to sweat through my blouse.

When we reach the 39th floor, the doors open to a wide, open workspace featuring chrome desks, massive touchscreen boards, a floor-to-ceiling window view of the city that makes my knees a little weak.

A man in a navy suit walks toward us with a tablet tucked under his arm. He looks like he's in late thirties, has efficient energy with a business smile.

""June?"" he asks.

""Yes. That’s me."" I answer, almost too quickly.

""I’m David Scott, head of Strategy. Welcome aboard. We’re thrilled to have you.""

""Thank you so much,"" I say, my voice just a touch too high. ""I’m really excited to be here.""

He nods and gestures toward the team bullpen. ""Let me introduce you around.""

As we walk, he points out departments: Market Analytics, Product Forecasting, Risk Oversight — and it all spins in my head like I’ve stepped into a live-action case study.

We reach a semicircle of desks where a few team members are mid-discussion.

""This is June, our new intern,"" David introduces with a clap of his hand.

I smile nervously, ""Hi. I am June Alexander.""

They all turn, polite and curious.

""June will be shadowing some of you this quarter,” he continues, ""learning how Apex moves in fast and—""

The door bursts open.

A tall, thin man in a black vest, clearly senior in rank, strides in with the kind of urgency that makes everyone shut up.

""Scott. Sorry to interrupt.""

David straightens. ""Of course, Mr. Paul.""

Mr. Paul doesn’t smile. ""The CEO just dismissed his secretary. We need a temporary replacement now. Someone sharp, quick, discreet.""

David blinks. ""Uh… well…""

His eyes flick to me. I blink back.

“You’re June, right?” Paul asks, already assessing me like a file he doesn’t have time to read.

""Yes?"" I answer, half-answer, half-question.

""You’re the new intern.""

""Yes. Yes Sir.""

""Good. You’re promoted. For the week.""

""Wait, I—what?"" I snap my head at David and he gives me an awkward shrug. ""You said you wanted exposure to the executive side of things.""

I open my mouth. Close it. Exposure wasn’t supposed to mean escort to hell.

""Come,"" Paul says. ""He’s waiting.""

My stomach tightens. My ears catches the murmurs and whispers of my almost-colleagues.

""It's just been a month since he became CEO, and he's already sacked three secretaries,"" one says. 

""Good luck to her,"" another muttered.

""Poor thing. She just got here."" 

What? A new CEO?

I didn’t know about this development.

Way to go, June. That’s what you get for skipping your research just to surprise yourself at your dream company.

I’m cooked.

As I follow Paul, my heels suddenly becomes too high, my heart too loud, and my brain too aware of how this place smells like cold coffee, printer toner, and high ambition.

We take a different elevator. The numbers climb fast as usual in my brain.

Stop breathing like you’re going to faint, June. You’re fine. You’re fine.

The elevator dings on the top floor and stops, causing my heart to have a little spike.

We step out into a hallway lined with black-tinted glass. The carpet here is thicker, I note, quieter even, and every surface gleams.

Paul gestures to the double doors at the end. ""There. Good luck, and please don't get fired early."" he says, half-smiling, half-pleading. 

And then he’s gone, like he had just presented bait to thousands of hungry fishes. (I am too dramatic, I know)

It's just me now.

I push the doors open, it doesn't open. Shit. Am I supposed to push or pull? I tried the latter, and it opens. Good job, June. 

I see him...

He’s standing at the far end of the office, back to me, his suit jacket off, sleeves rolled to the elbows. Looking out the window like he owns the horizon. Which, apparently, he does, I mean, he is the CEO of the biggest enterprise in the city.

But wait... I know that back. I know the slope of those shoulders. That veiny arms is familiar, too familiar, I tried to get it out of my head, days ago.

He slowly turns, and I forget how to stand.

I knew it! Slate-gray eyes, like metal under ice.

Twitchy Jaw. He's the same man, from the hotel. From the night I try to forget.

He stares at me and I try to stare back.

Neither of us says a word. The silence spreads like a crack in glass waiting to shatter.

His face doesn’t flinch, but his jaw tenses, just enough for me to notice.

​Being an entrepreneur in Nepal can be a bit lonely because your mind is always running 100mph. I’m looking for a girlfriend who is intelligent, curious, and wouldn't mind sitting down for a long conversation about anything—from business ideas and tech to life and philosophy.
​A bit about me:
​Work: I run a business, it’s my passion, but I’m learning to make time for life outside of it.
​Leisure: I love exploring the cafes in Jhamshikhel, occasional weekend escapes to Nagarkot or Dhulikhel, and I’m a big fan of exoloring new experiences.
​Personality: I’m driven and ambitious, but I value kindness and emotional connection above all else.
​What I’m looking for:
A woman who is independent and has her own goals. You don’t have to be an entrepreneur, but I’d love to be with someone who ""gets"" the drive to build something. Someone who enjoys deep talks, trying new food, and just having a good time without the pressure of ""traditional"" dating tropes.

Later, we strolled by the book market. He helped me by suggesting some books, and we started discussing them. I bought a few, and he helped me carry them since they were heavy. That’s when we began talking a bit more casually. 

He asked me what I liked besides books, and I mentioned girly things like bags, jewelry, and cosmetics. He then asked if I liked lip glosses. I said I did. 

Then he took out two lip glosses from his pocket—different flavors, cherry cola and tutti frutti—and joked that I’d need them to give him CPR. I laughed and asked him which flavor he liked more. He said he liked sweet things, especially me. It felt cheesy, but instead of getting shy, we both laughed. 

After that, he said he was hungry, so we went to McDonald’s. There, we talked normally about history, politics, his favorite books, his pet, and his assignments.

Problem I keep running into:

When I travel or work late, I want proper coffee with milk and froth, not black coffee. But carrying milk separately is a hassle, storage and spoilage are a problem, cafes aren’t always available, and office pantry coffee is usually bad.



So I’m exploring the idea of a plant based instant coffee sachet where you just add hot water. It includes non dairy milk, so you still get a proper milk coffee without carrying milk separately.



I want to understand if this situation actually resonates.

Is this a real problem for you?

Good morning and good day world,

  
This is my third check in since quitting Zyn 6Mg roughly 24 hours ago. I've been up for about three hours now, no breakfast in me yet, but feeling good. Honestly, not really any cravings this morning. There was probably a combined 10 minutes where I realized I wouldn't be able to have a Zyn on my drive to work, or with my coffee, and felt a bit of dread in my chest and weakness in my mentality. But, I reminded myself that those days are gone, I am quitting, and moved on with whatever I was doing at the time. The cravings passed and I kind of just forgot I was feeling them at all - I stayed busy with other tasks in front of me.

  
I do still feel extremely jittery and like my senses or awareness is hyper active. I am definitely undiagnosed ADHD so that might be a factor, but nonetheless there's an air of revitalization and growth to my physiological and emotional states. I feel like I'm getting better.



I do feel very irritable, short with people, etc. 

  
I'm looking forward to feeling better.

Grayson sent me a shirtless pic with one text: \[Coming over tonight.\]

Found him on his knees outside his building. Tying another girl's shoelaces.  
  
  
I stopped dead. Everything went cold.  
  
  
I thought he'd panic when he saw me. Scramble for an excuse.  
  
  
Instead, he smiled.  
  
  
""Ava! Perfect timing. This is Brielle—my girlfriend.""  
  
  
Then he turned to her.  
  
  
""Babe, this is Ava. We go way back. Just friends.""

So that's it. I was just a hookup with history.

Then he looked at me, annoyed.  
  
  
""Why'd you even come here? You should've just gone home.""  
  
  
The wind blew my hair across my face. Good. It hid the tears.  
  
  
I glanced down and saw my shoelace trailing loose. I bent down, tied it, wiped my eyes.

He didn't laugh. He kissed me again.  
  
  
After that, everything changed.  
  
  
We held hands in the snow. Kissed at midnight. Spent nights wrapped up in each other.  
  
  
I thought we were together.  
  
  
Turns out I was the only one who did.  
  
  
I got home and just... collapsed on the couch.

How do you tell someone you love them while you're still fucking someone else?  
  
  
My stomach lurched. I barely made it to my knees before I started dry-heaving.  
  
  
Another text.  
  
  
\[Be there in 10.\]  
  
  
I laughed. I was crying, but I laughed.  
  
  
So that's what I was. A booty call with a history.  
  
  
\[Don't come over.\] I texted him back.  
  
  
Typing bubble. Then:  
  
  
\[What's your problem? We've always been like this.\]  
  
  
\[Or are you mad I have a girlfriend now? Chill. I'm not even sleeping with her yet.\]  
  
  
I actually laughed out loud. It was that ridiculous.  
  
  
When did I ever say I was okay with this?  
  
  
Every time I slept with him, every time I let him touch me—it was because I loved him.  
  
  
And he thought—  
  
  
\[You were into it too.\]  
  
  
I blocked him without thinking twice. Deleted his number. Everything.  
  
  
Then I locked myself in the shower and stayed there for two hours.  
  
  
Like I could scrub him off my skin. Undo every stupid decision.  
  
  
I just felt disgusting.  
  
  
For giving him everything. For getting nothing back.  
  
  
When I got out, he was already inside.  
  
  
He grabbed me before I could say anything, pulled me close, mouth on my neck, hands everywhere.  
  
  
""Damn. You showered without me?""  
  
  
He dangled a box of condoms. ""Let me hop in real quick. Then we're good.""  
  
  
I snatched the box and threw it straight in the trash.  
  
  
""Give me my key back. And leave.""  
  
  
He stopped. Blinked.  
  
  
""Wait—are you serious right now? Did you actually catch feelings?""  
  
  
He laughed. Like it was funny.  
  
  
""Come on. We've known each other since we were kids. There's nothing new here.""  
  
  
I felt humiliated. Crushed. I couldn't even breathe.  
  
  
He finally got that I wasn't joking.  
  
  
He tossed the key on the floor.  
  
  
""Don't tell Brielle.""  
  
  
Pause.  
  
  
""I really love her.""  
  
  
That broke something in me.  
  
  
He knew exactly what he was doing.  
  
  
Whatever was left of my dignity, he ground it into the floor.  
  
  
Along with every memory that used to matter.  
  
  
I bit down hard so my voice wouldn't shake.  
  
  
""Fine.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
I dragged my ass to work the next day.  
  
  
Because that's what you do. You fall apart after five.  
  
  
I threw myself into every project I could find. If I stayed busy enough, maybe I wouldn't have to think.  
  
  
That night I was scrolling Instagram when Grayson's story popped up.  
  
  
My stomach flipped.  
  
  
When I first got on there, I'd bugged him until he followed me back. Took forever.  
  
  
My thumb hovered over his name. I knew I shouldn't.  
  
  
I clicked anyway.  
  
  
There they were. Faces pressed together. Fireworks exploding over Disneyland.  
  
  
I really into theme parks. I'd asked him a hundred times to go with me.  
  
  
Same line every time: ""That's for kids. We're almost thirty. Why would we go?""  
  
  
Guess it wasn't about Disneyland. It was about me.  
  
  
I kept scrolling.  
  
  
He looked so fucking happy.  
  
  
Every memory I thought was ours—he was already making new ones with her.  
  
  
I didn't sleep until three.  
  
  
Anger and heartbreak kept ripping through me in waves.  
  
  
I didn't get it.  
  
  
What did I do wrong? Why was I the one drowning while he got to be fine?  
  
  
...  
  
  
Christmas was coming. Work made us stay through Christmas Eve to hit some bullshit deadline.  
  
  
Everyone complained. I was relieved.  
  
  
Grayson's family lived across the hall. Every year our families had dinner together on Christmas Eve.  
  
  
At least now I had an out.  
  
  
By the time everyone left, it was past midnight.  
  
  
Fireworks started going off outside. I stood at the window watching them fade and didn't realize I was crying until my vision blurred.  
  
  
Suddenly someone tapped my shoulder.  
  
  
I spun around. My manager Liam stood there with two coffees.  
  
  
I wiped my face fast.  
  
  
I thought I was alone.  
  
  
Smiling, I took the cup. ""Thanks.""  
  
  
He kept his voice soft. ""Why are you still here?""  
  
  
I pressed my lips together. ""Leaving soon.""  
  
  
He smiled a little. ""You're always so put-together. Never seen you cry before.""  
  
  
Beat.  
  
  
""Bad breakup?""  
  
  
I froze. ""How'd you know?""  
  
  
He shrugged. ""You stopped posting about him.""  
  
  
I had nothing to say.  
  
  
Yeah. I used to post about Grayson constantly. Like I needed proof he was mine.  
  
  
Liam seemed to catch my embarrassment.  
  
  
""If your love life's a shitshow, throw yourself into work. Company's opening a southern office. We need someone to lead it.""  
  
  
He looked at me.  
  
  
""Board wants you. You in?""  
  
  
...  
  
  
It was late so Liam drove me home.  
  
  
Halfway there, snow started falling.  
  
  
I watched it through the window. Last Christmas it snowed too.  
  
  
Back the, Grayson and I set off sparklers in the snow. It came down so thick it covered our hair.  
  
  
My nose went numb but I didn't want to go inside. He grabbed my hand and shoved it in his jacket pocket.  
  
  
""What's with you? You're walking like a turtle.""  
  
  
I blamed the weather. ""Waiting for more snow.""  
  
  
He stopped. Cupped my face. Kissed my forehead.  
  
  
He grinned. ""That what you were waiting for?""  
  
  
...  
  
  
My head was spinning.  
  
  
Was any of that real? Or was I just some idiot replaying fake memories?  
  
  
My phone buzzed.  
  
  
Grayson. I still knew his number by heart.  
  
  
\[Why aren't you home? Your mom said you're still at work. I'll come get you.\]  
  
  
I glanced at it. Tossed my phone in my bag.  
  
  
Five minutes later Liam pulled up outside my building.  
  
  
I got out. He stopped me.  
  
  
""Hey—your fly.""  
  
  
I looked down. My zipper had busted open. No idea when.  
  
  
My face went nuclear. I yanked at it five times. Wouldn't budge.  
  
  
Kill me now.  
  
  
He smiled. ""Marry Christmas.""  
  
  
Then he drove off.  
  
  
I stood there wrestling with my zipper like an idiot.  
  
  
Then I turned and looked up.  
  
  
Grayson was standing there.  
  
  
So was Brielle.  
  
  
Her smile was all teeth. ""Oh wow. You two were just in his car and... haha... Christmas hookup?""  
  
  
""Starting strong!""  
  
  
I snapped, ""It's not like that!""  
  
  
She waved me off. ""Girl, relax. We're all adults. Grayson and I couldn't keep our hands off each other last time either. We were in the—""  
  
  
She giggled and shoved his arm. ""You're so bad!""  
  
  
Grayson's face turned to stone. His voice went ice-cold.  
  
  
""Don't compare yourself to her. She's not exactly picky, if you know what I mean.""  
  
  
At his words, Brielle fake-gasped, still giggling. ""Babe, that's mean.""  
  
  
He looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe. ""She's desperate and fake as hell.""  
  
  
Then he turned to Brielle, voice soft again.  
  
  
""You're nothing like her.""  
  
  
Pause.  
  
  
""You've got class. She's just... easy.""  
  
  
Brielle ate it up.  
  
  
I stood there. Nails digging into my palms so hard I thought I'd draw blood.  
  
  
""You're right,"" I said. Voice steady. ""I didn't know what good sex was until now.""  
  
  
I smiled.  
  
  
""Guess my standards were in hell.""  
  
  
Grayson's face went black.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Christmas morning, I woke up to chaos in the living room.  
  
  
Grayson's mom barged in and shook me through the blankets.  
  
  
""Get up, beautiful! You missed dinner last night. You're coming to lunch, and I'm not taking no for an answer.""  
  
  
I rubbed my eyes, still half asleep. Grayson stood behind her looking like he wanted to strangle someone.  
  
  
I was already scrambling for an excuse.  
  
  
My mom smiled. ""Grayson's girlfriend is coming over. Mabel invited all of us.""  
  
  
My brain stalled.  
  
  
Wait—already meeting the parents?  
  
  
""Mabel, I don't think—""  
  
  
My dad groaned. ""This girl. When's she gonna find someone? All she does is work. Your mother and I are going gray over here.""  
  
  
Great. Now it was about me.  
  
  
""Fine. I'll come.""  
  
  
...  
  
  
By the time I dragged myself over, everyone was already there.  
  
  
I could hear Mabel gushing about Brielle. How smart she was. How sweet. What a wonderful wife she'd make.  
  
  
I stepped inside. The room went quiet.  
  
  
I froze. Then it hit me.  
  
  
Mabel used to say that stuff about me.  
  
  
My mom coughed awkwardly. ""There you are. Come meet Brielle. Grayson's girlfriend.""  
  
  
Before I could say anything, Brielle spoke up.  
  
  
""Oh, we've actually met. The night Grayson and I got together.""  
  
  
She smiled. ""Ava showed up straight from the airport with her suitcase. You two must be really close.""  
  
  
Bringing that up felt like she'd torn off a scab I'd barely grown.  
  
  
My chest tightened. But it didn't that hurt like before.  
  
  
...  
  
  
Once the parents left, Brielle dropped the act.  
  
  
""You still hung up on him? That's... kinda sad. But hey, I get it.""  
  
  
She stepped closer, voice sugar-sweet. ""Whatever you two had before—it's cute. But let's be real. You never stood a chance.""  
  
  
""We're getting married in three months. You're welcome to come.""  
  
  
So they're married.  
  
  
I used to think about marrying him.  
  
  
Asked him once what kind of wedding he wanted.  
  
  
He didn't even look up. ""We're not even close to that. Why bring it up?""  
  
  
Tried asking in bed once. He just fucked me harder. Never answered.  
  
  
He never answered.  
  
  
But that was an answer, wasn't it?  
  
  
I was still thinking when Brielle's voice cut through.  
  
  
""Babe, I think Malt's hungry. Can we go check on him?""  
  
  
She pouted. ""I don't remember if I filled his bowl before we left...""  
  
  
That was an hour and a half round trip.  
  
  
I remembered when I forgot a file once. Called Grayson and asked him to drop it off.  
  
  
Ten-minute drive. He shut me down immediately.  
  
  
""Can you get your shit together? I'm not your delivery guy. I need a break too.""  
  
  
But now?  
  
  
Grayson was already grabbing his jacket. ""Get dressed. We'll leave now.""  
  
  
And just like that, I got it.  
  
  
The difference between love and nothing was that obvious.  
  
  
He was short with me because he never loved me.  
  
  
I was never his girlfriend. I was just... available. A safe fuck he didn't have to work for.

But I am looking for a grinder mainly for espresso shots, but I also make a larger pot of coffee (pourover) occasionally. That would mean different grind settings and also larger amounts of beans at once. 

I am quite new to this and looking for a decent grinder but on the cheaper side (I am in the Netherlands). People have recommended DF and Eureka Mignon.

Most Indian male dominated subs are filled with men cribbing about women all the f@cking time. Its always single unmarried guys who never had a girlfriend, cribbing about alimony and body count of women. It’s so tiring. 

I am 35F, married. Many of my women friends who are at this age range, and dont trust men, they just stay away from men silently. They never date, or sleep or try to marry a man. They just enjoy their single lives. 

But men never do that. All the single male friends I had, I started avoiding them now. Because they always pretend they have high standards like “women bring nothing to the table” and my wife will have to take care of my parents while paying 50:50 bills and all. But I know they are constantly being rejected by even unemployed women for their misogynistic patriarchal attitude towards women. 

How can you say you have high standards when no woman wants to have a coffee with you at all? 

Just recently I made a post about overpopulation in India and a man commented there, asking, what do I bring to the table as a 35F. Yes. Out of nowhere he wrote that. The topic was poverty and over population though. 

That man also wrote how my beauty will fade soon and because I am 35, I am not fertile anymore 😂. And he assumed I have no money. So he decided I bring nothing to the table. 

There is a rise of men who are not even misogynist but pure stupid. And by the way, they all want to do arranged marriage. And they are all worried about alimony. But no, they wont decide to stay single or do a love marriage. Never. ",52,1767704792.0,AskIndianWomen,37,0.92,False

It was a wonderful trip; in fact, I fulfilled a childhood dream by being there. I visited Disney, Universal Studios, Osaka, Kyoto, and many other places. In general, it's a very safe environment; I hadn't felt a single bit of fear until something happened to me… I was in a coffee shop with my boyfriend in the Nagano area, choosing what to eat before we went to the snow. That's when a hooded man wearing a mask entered the restaurant. Nothing unusual so far. My boyfriend went to the checkout line, and I went to get another bread roll. That's when I passed by this man; I had my back to him… And when I walked past him, he touched my butt… I froze. I thought I was imagining things and that I had bumped into the table. I didn't know what to do. I turned to tell my boyfriend what had happened, and the man quickly left the establishment… This ruined my day… Especially because I couldn't do anything about it, since I wasn't in my country… Only God knows how much I cried because of this, as this had never happened to me before. I was in shock and felt very, very bad… the place I always dreamed of left me with a trauma I will never forget. I know this could have happened anywhere, and yet I love Japan very much. But, I leave my account for every woman or parent of a child who is going to visit the place, even though Japan is a wonderful place, there are still ill-intentioned and bad-natured people! Be alert at all times and take care of your children!

1q5i190,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCBuildIt/comments/1q5i190/profitability_charts/,Profitability charts,"I never found reliable information about the profitability of commercial shops and therefore I made my own charts. The simoleons/minute metric from [simcity-buildit.fandom.com](http://simcity-buildit.fandom.com) does not take into account the costs of inputs and is therefore a useless number on its own. In the next paragraphs I will explain the assumptions that I made and how the numbers have been calculated. If you're not interested in the methodology, you can just look at the tables at the bottom. Key numbers are: Profit/Hour (profit assuming you can buy all inputs) and Profit2/Hour (profit assuming you have to make inputs yourself). Also a small TLDR with some simple production advice is given. Btw, I only did this for shops that are available at level 30.

**Assumptions**  
To get started we have to make some first assumptions. The main assumptions are numbered below:

1. All items are bought and sold at maximum price. This is the standard price used as input. We will see that the value of certain items sometimes is higher than this number if you have to make it yourself. I made exceptions for metal, wood and plastic. My reasoning is that you can't sell these at the same rate as you build them. Therefore you can not continuously produce and sell them for their max price. As a result, I valued them lower than their max price. I used seeds as a baseline: You can make 30 simoleons every 20 minute for each factory slot, which makes metal priced at 1/20 \* 30 = 1.5, wood is 4.5 and plastic is 15 (for simplicity I used 10 minutes). All other materials are bought at their max value.
2. We aim to always run the most productive item for each shop. For simplicity, I assumed you can log in at least once every 6 hours. Therefore, the profit you can make in 6 hours is used as a benchmark. Reason for this is that you can use this benchmark overnight. For example: it is not feasible to run nails 24/7, so therefore this is not a fair benchmark.
3. If you deviate to build something else, this comes at a cost. This cost is equal to the difference between profit you could have made running the most optimal item versus the profit you make now. Example: You can make 100 profit per hour for item A and item B makes 20 profit for half an hour. In half an hour you could have made 50 instead, so the cost of making item B is 30.
4. Profitability per hour is estimated for the base level of shops (so no upgrades). When you upgrade a shop, your profitability increases equally for all items. Therefore, relative profitability doesn't change among items.

**Metrics**

* Cost of inputs: sum of all costs for input items. For Profit/Hour, we assume all items can be bought. This is the optimal scenario as you don't have to lose profit to build inputs.
* Sales Value: General sales price of the item.
* Profit: Difference between Sales value and cost of inputs. This is the profit you instantly make when making the item one time.
* Time: Production time in minutes. As listed in 4. this assumes no shop upgrades.
* Profit/Hour: Profit/Time \* 60. The profit you make when producing the item for one hour.
* Profit/6 Hours: Total profit made over a period of 6 hours. Amount of items produced over this period is capped at 11 (maximum shop queue).
* Implied Factory Price (IFP): Price of an item when you have to make it yourself. This is equal to cost of inputs + benchmark profitability rate \* time. Benchmark profitability rate is set to the maximum of Profit/6 Hours for this shop. This rate is applied over the production time of the item to break even with the benchmark. Example: shop 1 has two items; A and B. Both take one hour to produce, cost of inputs are 100 and 300 respectively, and sales values are 200 and 350 respectively. The Profit/Hour for both is then 100 and 50 respectively and both are not capped in 6 hours. So the benchmark profitability rate is 100 an hour. Therefore the IFP for item A equals 200+100=300 (the sales value) and for item B it equals 300+100=400. The sales value is the lower bound for IFP.
* Cost of inputs 2: sum of all IFP's for input values. This assumes that all inputs have to be produced yourself. Note that we do assume that inputs for inputs (eg Saplings as inputs for Fruits as inputs for Smoothies) can be bought.
* IFP2: Same exercise as IFP, but now adding the additional costs of producing inputs yourself.
* Profit2/Hour: Profit per hour assuming you have made inputs yourself.

**Takeaways**

* In general it is always good to buy inputs yourself. This way you avoid making small losses on your production plan. I sometime have heard the opposite: to always make things yourself instead of buying, but this comes at a cost. Note that buying is never a losing strategy because you can always resell for the same value. If you choose to do something else with it, this means that you value it higher and therefore you are already making a profit!
* Especially aim to buy things where sales value is lower than IFP. These items are more costly to make than they are to buy! Having a large storage is very helpful to stock up on these items for when you need them.  Items that you should aim for buying to use for your production are: shovels, measure tapes, vegetables, fruits, bread rolls and cream. Even hammers can be helpful to stock up, so you can produce measure tapes to set up production of caps.
* When dong epics or war deliveries you can evaluate offers using these metrics. If some item can't easily be bought this probably means you will need to produce it yourself. Use IFP (or even IFP2 is inputs are also scarce) to determine whether it's worth it. Sometimes it may be cheaper to buy a more expensive item than to produce a cheaper one! Example: buying shoes is cheaper than producing cheese.
* Most profitable items per shop are: nails (or cement if you are away from the game), hammers, flour bags, chairs, grass, donuts (I assume we can't buy fruits all the time), caps, nothing from fast food store, and lighting systems. I put nothing for the fast food shop, because none of the items has easy to find inputs. When making the inputs yourself, this shop makes a loss! Maybe if the bot items change this can be different.",11,1767704699.0,SCBuildIt,0,1.0,False

1q5i0dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1q5i0dj/providing_feedback_on_tokyo_locations_for_4th/,Providing Feedback on Tokyo locations for 4th visit (Ebisu and Nishi Nippori),"I realised whilst commenting on another thread that I'd not posted feedback on the two neighbourhoods I picked for our stays in Tokyo at the start and end of our recent trip, having fallen into a spiral of analysis paralysis before the trip!

We've stayed in Shinjuku, Asakusa and Narita on previous visits to Japan and I wanted to stay somewhere different this time.

On arrival we stayed in Nishi-Nippori at the Hotel Tokyo Trip Ueno Nishi Nippori. We loved this location in *nearly every* aspect - wonderful small neighbourhood vibe, some excellent places to eat within steps of the hotel, and only a few minutes walk to the nearest station - Nishi-Nippori is on the JR Yamanote line and JR Keihin-Tohoku line, the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda line and the Toei Nippori-Toneri line. Very handy. Also an easy walk to Yanaka Ginza. Only downside is that, despite their best efforts on glazing, the level of noise from the many different rail lines passing very close to the hotel was probably the loudest I've ever experienced anywhere anywhen. Even with good quality wax earplugs, it was a struggle. Which is a bummer as I really loved our hotel room and huge balcony (though it was during Tokyo heatwave so too hot to use anyway). This hotel did keep luggage before / after check in / check out and they also allowed us early check in at noon (for a fee).

Before departure, we stayed in Ebisu at Prince Smart Inn Ebisu. This was a last minute booking as the apartment I'd originally booked (which was located right by Ebisu Yokocho) revealed in its check-in text that there were no lifts. As it was 5th floor, and I have mobility issues that was a problem for me. It was obvious they hide this deliberately as they included a request not to reference it in my review. I reported it to the booking platform and cancelled but had limited choice left on what I could find. The Prince Smart Inn was to the West of Ebisu station rather than the East, and a touch further than I'd have preferred, though perfectly doable. The station is on the JR Yamanote line, Saikyo line and Shonan-Shinjuku line, and the Tokyo Metro Hibiya line, so again, very easy to get around. We booked this hotel's largest room size and it was a good size yet very poor use of space, so in many ways it felt a lot smaller. Note that this hotel does not have a normal manned reception and are very strict on not storing luggage before check-in or after check-out. I really liked Ebisu itself and would absolutely stay in that area again, and it had soooo many great restaurants, bars, coffee shops and shops.

Like 18 months ago it got back to me through a colleague that she was asking if I was single, I wasn’t, and made that clear and nothing else really happened except friendly small talk exchanges in the hallways if I saw her. Few months go by, she added me on social media, chatted a little, nothing interesting, spoke about study, family and work. This continued for a while then suddenly she distanced. I wasn’t fussed I was still in a relationship and had no intention of being unfaithful or doing anything sketchy. This trend of chat for a while then distance happened 3 or so more times without much clear explanation but I was never really worried. She would tell me more and more sensitive stuff like her dad passing away suddenly, or that she’s got shit going on at work or when she passes her classes with each time but I always perceived it as friendly. She knows I’m still in a relationship as she’s liked posts I’ve made of me and my GF and she’s even following my GF on insta and liked posts there too… she’s also mentioned how she’s been hurt really bad by a guy cheating on her with her best friend and could never do something like that - which again, to me all pointing to nothing weird. Where the vibes change is just lately… she’s asked if we could get coffee or lunch a few times, she got funny when I didn’t reply to her for a few days and made a post of my GF talking about “you forgot about me huh?” and just today, I mentioned she looked really sunburnt in a pic she sent me, and unprovoked sent a raunchy pic of like underboob… nothing actually revealing but just had like her arm covering stuff… is she into me and i need to shut it all down or am i being crazy. For context this chick is like physically stunning and is very popular and her ex’s are like big muscular tatted, six pack guys and I’m literally just a tubby chill dude… what’s the vibe?? Help.

1q5hx88,https://i.redd.it/cr8lnhsk8qbg1.jpeg,Emotional Stress??? In a cactus????,"Good morning! I love plants but I don't really have a green thumb. So, in a moment of concern, I recently pondered why one of my Christmas cactuses had developed a distinctly wilted, world-weary look. Naturally, I did what any modern person does when faced with a mystery of life: I asked the internet what was wrong.

The answer, according to the search results, was “stress.”

This seemed reasonable. Plants, like people, have their limits. So I read on.

Unfortunately, I initially misread the explanation as “emotional stress.”

I paused.

Emotional stress? I thought. In a cactus?

This immediately opened up a whole new set of questions. Had it been binging on news programs? Was it reacting to post-holiday chaos? Had it read my 2026 to-do list? Was it upset about the lack of sunlight, or was it simply disappointed in me on a more personal level?

I stood there for a moment, quietly considering whether this Christmas cactus was overwhelmed by unmet expectations, unresolved feelings, or perhaps the general state of the world.

It was only after rereading the article—more carefully this time—that I realized the actual phrase was “environmental stress.” Too much water. Too little water. Drafts. Temperature changes. The usual, very plant-specific issues.

Still, I can’t help feeling that emotional stress shouldn’t be entirely ruled out.

After all, this cactus has endured years of my well-meaning but questionable care— overwatered, underwatered, moved here and there. It lives in a house where projects pile up, deadlines loom, and consumption of coffee and tea is constant. If any plant has reason to sigh dramatically and wilt in protest, it’s this one.

So, I adjusted its environment, gave it a new, larger pot, a sunnier spot by the window, and offered a sincere apology—just in case.

With luck it will soon perk up. Whether from improved conditions or simply feeling seen, I can’t say. But the experience has reminded me of an important lesson: sometimes when we think something is suffering from emotional stress, it really just needs better lighting and fewer drafts.

And possibly a little love and understanding.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1767704414.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

I have flown this airport a lot but this time I was on the side of the terminal for gates 1-14 (gate 3) and so I went to a spot right near gate 5. I don’t know the name of it bc I didn’t get a receipt and my bank transaction just says “Austin airport” but it’s on the left side, red and white decor, and they mostly do coffee and pastries, but had some pre-made breakfast sandwiches with either bacon or sausage in some warming display. I ate half of the bacon one.

Does anyone know what the place is called and did you have an awful night like I did between Jan 4-5? 

Thanks!

EDIT: I ate at Medici, and I 100% cannot blame them for my food poisoning. In an attempt to figure out what may have gotten me sick, my question is if anyone else had the same experience as me. 

I understand that this could have been brought on by something I ate prior or possibly after. Thanks!",0,1767704086.0,austinfood,10,0.2,False

I mean averaging 5-7 hours a day of research/cold reach outs/ warm reach outs/ coffee chats/ applying… etc. the job market is really tough as a we all prob know and so it took me up until mid Dec to land my first offer (even with a stacked resume (3 internships in nyc at big name firms, good grades etc)).

The job I got is awesome and in the field sorta that I want to get into. The only issue is that for the first 5 months of the job I have to commute 2 hours (one way) to a city for it 3 times a week. So my commute for the total week is 12 hours. This is for training purposes my boss said and then I can go fully remote and move wherever. 

I ended up taking the job and my first day was yesterday. The job was great but I completely broke down last night on my way home bc I was so exhausted from the commute. I honestly don’t think I can go back and forth like that for that long. Am I being dramatic by saying I can no longer accept this position? I’ve already brought up the commute in the interview process and that’s when she allowed me to go fully remote after 5 months. But now actually seeing what it’s like along with a full days work… I just don’t know. Am I stupid for passing up a great job in this market? Or being a bad person for accepting it in the first place? I don’t know and feel really lost",2,1767704083.0,Career,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I sanitize my bathroom regularly. The nMom is tidy, but she's not *clean*. She never washes her hands after using the bathroom. When she wipes down the kitchen after dinner, she uses the dirty washrag/dirty dishwater that she just cleaned out a greasy pot with. She wears her soft slippers in the wet yard, to the gas station, in the garage. And the absolute bane on my existence - one of those soft/carpet toilet seat covers and *never*, I repeat *never* sanitizes her toilet. I mean, how could you anyway with that fucking carpet on there? I rip that thing off the moment I can and I clean her toilet. It wouldn't be so bad that it's on there, but she pisses on the seat and doesn't clean it up. It absorbs into that disgusting cover.

I was living in an apartment that had one bathroom. Like clockwork, the moment she would step into my apartment, she beelines straight to my clean bathroom, uses the toilet, pisses on the seat, and doesn't wash her hands. In my household, when we flush the toilet, we do it with the lid closed. My young daughter has been able to follow this with no problem, but my mom just absolutely does not. I can always tell when someone has used my bathroom because the lid isn't closed. 

And another one of her quirks? This has annoyed and disgusted me ever since I was a kid. When she has to go to the bathroom, she starts pulling her pants down before she gets in the room. Down the hallway, pants are halfway down. Butt exposed. 

We've stayed at hotels and Airbnbs with her. Piss on the seat. Dry sink (as in no hands washed). We stayed at one Airbnb where the toilet was on the far opposite side away from the sink. I went in to use it. Lid up, piss on the seat. I, for the 9,826th time, say to her ""wipe the seat when you pee on it."" Her ridiculous gaslighting lie this time? ""Oh it's cuz I was washing my hands and they dripped on the toilet."" Same day, she left poop on the seat and didn't clean it and said she didn't even have a bowel movement. I have called her out on not washing her hands many many times and the amount of time she said ""Oops I forgot"" isn't calculable. 

We stayed at another Airbnb that had 3 bathrooms, including a full en suite bathroom in her bedroom. I had one in mine, and my daughter had a full bathroom off the kitchen. We all said beforehand, everyone is using their own bathroom. I was in the kitchen, and nMom walks out of her room and goes right into the bathroom off the kitchen. She giggles and says ""don't tell (my daughter)"". I yell for my kid, ""Kid! Grammy is using your bathroom!"" My daughter runs out of her room and starts knocking on the bathroom door asking why she's in there and why didn't you use the one in your room that you just came from?

I moved out of my apartment and into their old house when they relocated in March. The master bedroom has the en suite bathroom. There's also a main bath in the hallway and a 3rd bathroom downstairs. I sanitized the holy hell out of them when I moved in. My mom and dad came up to get a load to take back to their new house and my mom needed to use the toilet but my dad was in the hall bathroom. Like clockwork, she starts pulling down her pants and starts walking into my bedroom to use my bathroom. I said ""what are you doing?"" ""Using the bathroom."" ""You're not going in my bedroom. This is my house now and you're not going in my room or bathroom."" ""FINE I'LL USE THE BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS!!!!""

So now, I am in the middle of buying a house and I close in 2 weeks. I am unfortunately stuck at their house. The old house sold and I am stuck here while I transition to my new house. I've been here since November 23rd. She and my daughter were staying at the old area for a few weeks so she could finish the semester. They only came down here on December 19th and I can't express my annoyance.

My basement setup here has only a toilet and a sink, no shower. I have to go upstairs to take a shower. She had that goddamn carpet cover on her toilet. I ripped it off when she was gone. The basement walks out to the garage and as you exit/enter, you would pass my bathroom. And of course, when she is down here she *has* to use my bathroom. I ran to get a coffee the other day and she came downstairs to do laundry. Of course she had to use my bathroom. How did I know? The fucking lid was up. 

The other day, she comes down here to talk to me about my daughter's birthday. She says ""I gotta go potty first."" So you were upstairs, where your main bathroom is and you came all the way down here to use my fucking bathroom? And she didn't fucking close the lid. And didn't fucking wash her hands.

I can't stand it. I cannot fucking stand it. I cannot wait to get the fuck away from her.

Now of course, I would never deny someone use of the bathroom - that would be absurd. I'm not a monster.  ",2,1767703928.0,narcissisticparents,2,1.0,False

It didn't go away after the exam season, went to an ENT dr and turns out I had pharyngitis from the acidity even tho I never felt acid reflux or heart burn. I drank so much coffee tea soda and energy drinks while studying so it made my acidity worse, and she could clearly see the burns on my throat ( almost chemical burns ) , she put me on a PPI and no coffee or soda or tea and no eating before bed. Within 4 weeks it drastically improved. It takes a bit longer to fully heal. 

I suggest if you have globus get that checked first cuz it's one of the Most common causes and people neglect it and blame it on globus hystericus. And of you don't treat it in time it becomes a lifelong sensation because it forms strictures and ( scars ) on the throat that can even cause difficulty swallowing foods on long term 

Any ENT should be able to see it, they will just use a small camera tube to see the lining of your throat, no pain no anaesthetic nothing ur just sitting and it's 5 seconds lol, and they can clearly see if your throat is inflamed. 

I hope this post helps someone and prevents it from getting worse. Especially those who have gerd or regular acidity that could be a reason.

This all started when I was 18. We met at University, living in Mexico. We were always told how a ""handsome"" couple we were, and the truth is we were both physically attractive and ""popular"". We were together for 2 beautiful years, wishing to finish college together, get married, etc. Sadly, M decided to break up just before summer holidays. I couldn't understand anything, he was determined, I had my suspicions about another girl and they turned out to be true. I was heartbroken, I felt ugly, how could he have left me for another person?

This is emb@rras1ng, but I begged and pleaded not to break up. M was cold, selfish, determined and had moved on. That summer was the worst, I lost so much weight, could even eat, didn't want to leave my house, etc. My mom would hand me her car's keys and say ""please, I can't see you like this, go and meet your friends"". That summer, little by little I started forcing me to do stuff. My friends invited me to a rally summer camp. We would party, do scavenger hunt in the mountains by a lake, party, etc. Best idea ever. This helped a lot. The prize for the winning team in this camp was a trip to a famous and popular coastal city with lots of night clubs and party. My team didn't win, but I knew a couple of friends from the winning team, so they invited me. 2 Weeks later I was hanging out with new people on this beautiful mexican coast. There I met a Spanish guy (D), long story short we started dating.

Two months had gone by since the break up, M started going on social media liking old photos on Facebook. I didn't move a finger, only to block him everywhere. Then, he started going on my friend's profiles and liking their pictures where I would be present. Anyways, I ignored him. M started calling, texting. I said enough. I had met D, was happy and was ready to move on. Two years later me and D decided to move to Spain, I had finished college, I was 22 and was ready for a big change. The relationship with D changed a lot when we moved to Spain, we even married in a civil wedding. No big party or anything, just signing and nothing much changed. Sadly again this ended, and it ended badly after 2 years in Mexico and 1 year in Spain. I suffered a lot too, because this time I was 24 I didn't know what to do with my life and I was away from my family, in another continent. I decided to stay in Spain and study a Master's degree. Then, maybe, I would go back to Mexico. Mind you, M was completely out of the radar for me. So I stayed in Spain but the summer just before starting my Master's I decided to spend a month in Mexico. This is where it all started.

4 LONG YEARS had gone by, I was a different person. I was in my hometown visiting everyone, going out to party with my friends and one day I see M at a popular bar. He tried to smile from the distance, I ignored him and even gave him a bitter look. I was still hurt and didn't want to know anything. This day, one of his friends that also had been my friend, came and said ""Hey L!, listen, I'm really sorry to bother you, M just left, but he asked me to tell you that he wants to talk to you, here's his phone number, he's really interested in having a heart to heart conversation with you"". I said: ""Thanks, I don't need or want his number and I don't need or want to talk to him"". A week later one of his friends sent me a FB private message: ""Hi, I'm sorry, M asked me to tell you that please, please he wants to see you. He wants to talk to you, I know you're not giving me your number, but here's his number, please contact him"". I was really thoughtfull for a few days unitl I finally told to myself, ""I've been hating this guy for so long, I have moved on, I'm so much better now, I can handle this, get over the hate and resentment and try to forgive him once and for all, for my own peace.

I texted: ""Hello M, it's L."" He said: ""Hi, look, please, forgive me for being so annoying, I'm really glad you texted. Can we meet in person and have a coffee? I would like to know what you've been up to for such a long time."" I said ok. We met at a café. Chatted so calmly. He was so nervous, his eyes where shiny and sweet, he couldn't believe I was sitting on the opposite chair across the little table, I couldn't believe I was seeing his face right in front of me. He said he was sorry. He apologized for being so cold, so neglectful during the break up and he said he was so happy for me, he admired me. He had been aware of my life because of our friends in common, and he knew everyhitng about Spain. He said ""Seeing your pictures, your goals, the places you've been to, how beautiful you are and you haven't changed a bit, made me feel so stupid but at the same time so proud for having met such an amazing girl like you. I knew I could never ever find anyone like you in this city"". I tried to be so proud, giving him happy but cold looks, giving him a vibe that I was unbothered and just letting him know I forgave him. This time, I felt I wanted to move on. This time I felt it was me the one to say ""too bad you lost me"". After this we said goodbye. I was going back to Spain in just 2 weeks, and he said ""I would like to see you again in your remaining time here in Mexico"". I said, ""Okay"". So he texted again, we met again. We started hanging around like two friends. We would buy a couple of beers, meet at a park at night, talk about our lives, laugh a lot and then each of us would go back home in our cars. I was healing, I had forgiven him. I was happy I didn't hate this person anymore.

A week after this recent friendly ""meetings"" or ""dates"", we went to a park again. Met there, a summer night recounting stories from the past and having some drinks. Then we stared in silence. It felt like a full minute looking at each other in silence, but my mind was saying ""look away, look away"". And then he took my hand, and he softly, shyly and nervously said ""L, can I kiss you?"". I was cold, I couldn't believe it, in my mind I tought ""He does not deserve me anymore. He lost me, he hurt me, he's going to win, AGAIN."" And then I said ""Yes"". We kissed, so romantically, it was a friggin' cosmic kiss, lots of things running through my mind. This was crazy. We met again and again for the remaining of my vacations in Mexico. We were ""back"" but knowing this was coming to an end again. The last night before my flight back to Spain we were at this park again. I was sitting on the bench, he was lying on the bench resting on my chest, we were hugging and in silence I could feel this unexplicable LOVE feeling. So strong, so pure. And then he said: ""L, I still love you. And I feel I even love you harder this time."" I knew I was feeling the same, but this time I knew I didn't want to give up my dreams of going back to Spain and study my masters. I said ""I feel that too, but you must know I won't stay. I have to go back and I will be there for at least a year"". We said goodbye, hugged each other so so tightly. The next day I left. For the following weeks and months when I was back in Spain we continued talking on WhatsApp. Until sadly, the time made its work. I was into my studies, I met a guy, he met a girl. And it all ended in casual messages wishing we were doing great, sometimes replying to Insta stories. Sometimes he likes my pictures. Sometimes I like his pictures. He got married last year, he seems happy. I am sadly going through another break up AGAIN. I am aching, I am sad, I can't accept I'm all ""alone"" again. Being 31, I feel like love is painful. I am terrified to love again. It's been a week since I'm suffering again. And here I am, telling you M's story, with the hope that my new ex comes back some day. Telling me he still loves me, telling me that he's sorry and that love can linger and grow even bigger after so many years.",1,1767703672.0,ExNoContact,0,0.67,False

Match with someone or join a group, exchange the most boring small talk known to humanity (where you from, what do you do, what are your hobbies maybe what’s your favourite colour), maybe text back and forth for a few days, then someone ghosts or the conversation just dies a slow painful death. Rinse and repeat 50 times.

I feel like the problem is these apps make friendship feel like a transaction. You're literally swiping on people like you're shopping for friends on amazon and it's so weird. In college you became friends with people because you sat next to them in class or lived in the same dorm or joined the same club, there was context and shared experiences. Now it's just hi I'm sarah I like hiking and coffee want to be my friend? How are you supposed to build anything real from that?

I miss when making friends just happened naturally through doing stuff together instead of having to pitch yourself like you're applying for a job. Does anyone else feel this way or am I just terrible at using these apps?

I don't think the health apps on my Ticwatch are that great; I find them rather confusing.

Is there a recommended app that I can use to keep track of my heart rate over several days, weeks and months?

The aim is to be able to easily track changes over time. Like - this week I drink coffee, that week I don't, What's the difference?

Ideally, it would also allow me to add notes, comments, etc.

Plus - not only visible on the watch, but also with a companion app on the phone or web-based - or properly synching into some larger health app that does the pulse part really well.

I built an unofficial Dice Throne web app called Karnyx to track matches, stats, PvE, and tournaments. It’s grown into a full community tool with Achievements & Cosmetics now live and the Age of Innovation seasonal race officially underway. Free, non-commercial, and made purely out of love for the game.

Hello Everyone!

A couple of months back, I shared a Dice Throne web app I was building as a personal project. Since then, it’s grown a lot, and I wanted to give an update on what it’s become and what’s new.

# What is Karnyx and how did it start?

While looking for digital tools to support our Dice Throne sessions, I found that most didn’t quite fit what I was looking for. I wanted something that could easily track matches, statistics, campaigns, and tournaments in one place. So I built a small web application purely for personal use.

The app uses data generated from tracked Dice Throne activities to automatically produce player and hero statistics. Over time, it grew into something far more complete, and I realized it could be useful for other players as well.

The long-term goal with Karnyx is to help unify the Dice Throne community - Organized Play, Discord groups, and players at home - all supported by a single ecosystem.

# New: Achievements, Cosmetics & a New Season

Two major updates have recently gone live in Karnyx.

* Achievements & Cosmetics - Karnyx now includes an achievement system with unlockable Avatars, Borders, and Titles. A small initial set of achievements is live to ensure everything works as intended, with more coming over time.
* Age of Innovation - Seasonal Ranking The Age of Innovation seasonal race has officially begun. Ranked play is already active, with hundreds of matches played since January 1st and the ladder quickly taking shape.

# What does Karnyx currently offer?

Karnyx brings together a wide range of tools designed to support every way Dice Throne is played - from competitive PvP and Organized Play to PvE campaigns and casual home games. The following features are currently implemented, with more planned over time:

* Log and track Dice Throne PvP matches - supports 1v1, 2v2, and King of the Hill.
* Create and run tournaments - multiple formats and rulesets, including Challonge-integrated tournaments (Organized Play) with automatic stat tracking.
* Complete PvE suite - track Adventures, Missions, One-Shots (Dungeons), and Minion Rushes.
* Player and hero statistics - automatically generated from all tracked activities.
* Leaderboards - seasonal, all-time, and PvE-specific rankings.
* Hero randomizer - quick hero selection tools, with more utilities planned.
* Leagues (Communities) - filter leaderboards and stats for specific groups.
* Friends list - quickly add frequent players to new matches.

# Final Notes

Karnyx is a completely unofficial, fan-made tool. It’s free to use, non-commercial, and built purely out of appreciation for Dice Throne and its community.

If you’re curious, want to try it out, or have feedback, I’d love to hear it. The project exists because of the community - and the goal is to keep bringing all parts of the Dice Throne world closer together.

Thanks for reading ❤️

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

1q5hgi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1q5hgi9/the_ultimate_test_for_a_healthy_relationship_and/,The ultimate test for a healthy relationship (and why most fail it without knowing),"We talk a lot about “green flags” and “red flags” in relationships. But here’s something most people totally overlook: **Can you and your partner be bored together without falling apart?** Yep. That’s the test. No drama. No dopamine rush. Just two humans co-existing in stillness. And the scary part? A lot of couples *can’t* do it.

This post is a reflection from digging into some of the best relationship psychology out there. Podcasts, research papers, books by therapists who’ve seen hundreds of couples crash and burn. Sharing it because too many people confuse chaos with chemistry, and it costs them years of emotional peace.

Here’s what the research-backed pros say makes or breaks a relationship:

1. **Boredom is the real test**  
Esther Perel, a psychotherapist and best-selling author, points out that sustaining desire in long-term relationships isn’t about intense passion—it’s about how couples deal with monotony. In her TED Talk *""The secret to desire in a long-term relationship""*, she explains that couples who stay curious about each other, even when life gets repetitive, tend to last longer. If you can’t sit in silence with your partner or survive a chill Sunday without drama, that’s not romantic tension—it’s emotional immaturity.

2. **Emotional regulation > communication skills**  
A study from The Gottman Institute tracked over 3,000 couples and found that **emotional self-soothing is more predictive of long-term success than great communication techniques**. Translation: how you treat each other when tensions are high matters more than what you say. If one or both people can’t manage their own stress without dumping it on the other, the relationship turns into a boxing ring.

3. **Conflict style matters more than conflict frequency**  
According to Dr. Sue Johnson, the founder of Emotionally Focused Therapy, it’s not how *much* you fight, but *how* you fight. Is there blame? Withdrawals? Sarcasm? Or is there an effort to reconnect emotionally after conflict? Her research shows that **safe emotional bonds** are built when people feel secure even during disagreement. That safety is rare—but it’s everything.

4. **Shared rituals prevent emotional drift**  
Researchers from the University of Texas found that simple shared rituals, like making coffee together every morning or walking after dinner, drastically improve long-term satisfaction. These habits create what’s called “shared meaning,” which helps prevent emotional distancing. When life gets boring, shared rituals are your glue.

5. **You should still like each other when everything else is stripped away**  
A National Marriage Project report noted that **friendship between romantic partners is the key to resilience**. Not compatibility in hobbies, but genuine admiration and respect. If your partner stopped being funny, hot, or rich—would you still enjoy their company? That’s the core.

Most relationships feel amazing when they’re new. But so do amusement parks. The real test is how you show up when it’s quiet, hard, or boring. Pass that test, and the rest kinda takes care of itself.",3,1767703082.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

I had an idea that came straight from my day job. No big “startup insight”, just a problem I kept seeing everywhere. Content takes forever, AI output sounds generic, and people spend more time fixing things than actually creating. I talked about this idea a lot, I overthought it, I scoped it to death and kept pushing it off.

At one point I was having conversations with senior engineers about building it “the right way” and the estimates were months of work and a lot of money, and that alone was enough to keep me frozen.

Last summer I applied to the Lovable S1 Shipped accelerator and got in. That was honestly the best thing that happened.

I built River AI in public and launched the first version in about six weeks, it was scary. Putting something unfinished out there where people can see it, judge it, or just ignore it is uncomfortable. Building in public was one of the reasons I delayed for so long!!

Since launching, things slowly started to move. We now have over 150 users, more than 400 workflows have been executed, I’ve done 50+ demos, and we have paying customers. We’re still improving every week and fixing things as we go.

This was late nights, coffee shops, working after work, breaking things, fixing them, being nervous before early demos, and having way more conversations that went nowhere than ones that worked. I remember burning through 110
Credits in less than 3 hours to fix one bug!!!

Distribution has been the hardest part. Building is only half the job, every signup came from talking to people, reaching out, demos, tapping into my network, and being a little annoying about something I genuinely believe can help teams.

Lovable made it possible for me to move fast without getting stuck in engineering paralysis. I don’t think River AI exists in its current form without it. At the very least it would have taken much longer and I probably would’ve talked myself out of it again.

If you’re sitting on an idea and scared to build in public, I get it. I genuinely do. Starting, even imperfectly, teaches you more than months of planning ever will. Even if your first idea doesn’t work, the learning is so valuable.

2025 ended up being a big year for me because of this. I’m excited and a little nervous about what 2026 brings.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’ve never posted before, but this has been eating at me for months and I genuinely don’t know if I’m overreacting or ignoring red flags. Also, I had difficulty organizing this correctly and I did use ChatGPT to help me write this in a more organized way. 

Context:
This happened the day after we came back from our honeymoon, about 6 months ago. I love my wife, I’m not trying to accuse her of cheating, and at the time I truly just wanted clarity so I could be at peace.

What happened:
That morning, I woke up early and noticed my wife had left her phone in the kitchen. During our honeymoon she had taken a nude picture of me, and I’ve always hated the idea of naked pictures of myself existing anywhere. So I unlocked her phone and deleted the photo. I also checked the “recently deleted” folder to make sure it was fully gone.

While in the recently deleted folder, I noticed screenshots from WhatsApp. The screenshots were of an Instagram post showing my wife and her ex celebrating his birthday together. What stood out was that the screenshots came from a WhatsApp chat with a contact saved as just a single period: “.”

When you tap on a picture in WhatsApp, you can see a small camera roll at the bottom showing all images shared in that chat. That camera roll showed many pictures, all seemingly related to their past relationship.

That raised questions for me.

I then opened WhatsApp and noticed that:
	•	The conversation with that contact had been deleted
	•	The contact itself had been deleted

At that point, I was confused and uneasy.

The conversation:
Later that morning, my wife and I went for a walk. I was quiet. She asked what was wrong. I told her I wanted to ask something and really just talk — not argue.

I told her, very clearly, “I’m not accusing you of anything. I just want the truth so I can be calm.”

I asked: “Who is (Ex’s Name)?”
She immediately replied: “Why do you want to know?”

I explained that I knew he was her ex and that I had seen screenshots of pictures of the two of them in a WhatsApp conversation that looked like it was filled with photos.

She then focused on why I went through her phone, and I explained the nude picture. I told her that while I understood being upset about that, this was important to me and I just wanted honesty.

Her explanation:
She said that days before our wedding (which is while I was still in the U.S. and she in her home country where the wedding was), she received multiple calls from an unknown number. When she finally answered, it was her ex.

She said:
	•	He told her he found out she was getting married and wanted to meet for coffee
	•	She told him he was crazy, that she thought he had a girlfriend, and that he should be with her instead
	•	She told him they had nothing to talk about and to never contact her again

She said that after that, he began sending her only pictures from their past relationship, saying he found them and thought she might want to see them.

She said she never replied, saved the contact as “.” so she’d know it was him and ignore it, and eventually deleted everything.

My doubts (and where things escalated):

I asked:
	1.	Why save his contact at all instead of blocking him? Saving it as “.” felt intentionally hidden to me.
	2.	Why screenshot the picture of them together? She initially said she sent it to her cousin.
	•	When I asked to see that conversation for context, it turned out she never sent it to her cousin.
	3.	How did he even get her U.S. number?
She is an immigrant and has an American number. She first said he got it through her mom — which turned out to be false.
Then she said he probably got it through Instagram because she used to teach English online.

I checked her Instagram. No phone number was listed.

When I pointed out inconsistencies, she became extremely angry, shut down the conversation, and said:
	•	This marriage will never work
	•	Divorce was the only option
	•	I was horrible for doubting her
	•	She did nothing wrong and there was no reason for my questions

I want to be clear: I don’t believe she cheated.
What bothered me was:
	•	Saving an ex’s contact instead of blocking
	•	Deleting the conversation
	•	Lying or changing stories when asked simple questions
	•	Exploding with anger when I tried to understand

Where I am now (6 months later):
I still have doubts — not constant, but unresolved. I’ve started having dreams about this situation, reliving the emotions. When I wake up, I feel distant until I calm myself down.

When she asks what’s wrong, I usually say I had a bad dream. If I admit what it was about, she immediately reacts with anger, tells me it’s horrible that I don’t trust her, storms out, and calls me a horrible husband.

Additional context:
	•	Our intimacy has been basically dead for over a year
	•	She is extremely anxious, tense, and explosive over small things
	•	I feel like I’m not allowed to express anything negative without it becoming my fault

She has PCOS and endometriosis, which I know can severely affect hormones and mental health. I’ve been very patient and often tell myself her reactions are because of this — not because of guilt.

But at the same time, nothing has been done to make me feel safe or reassured, and any attempt to revisit the topic ends in anger.

So my question:
Am I overreacting for still having doubts about this situation?
Or is it reasonable to feel unsettled when things don’t add up and the conversation is never allowed to exist?

I truly want to know if this is a me problem.

TL;DR:
The day after our honeymoon, I deleted a nude photo of myself from my wife’s phone and noticed deleted WhatsApp screenshots involving her ex, saved under a hidden contact name (“.”). She said he contacted her right before our wedding, sent only old photos, and she ignored him — but her explanations changed, she lied about a few details, and reacted with extreme anger when I calmly asked for clarity. Six months later I still have unresolved doubts, recurring dreams about it, and any attempt to talk ends with her saying I’m horrible and threatening divorce. Am I overreacting for still feeling unsettled, or is it reasonable given the inconsistencies and lack of reassurance",0,1767702299.0,AmIOverreacting,27,0.25,False

**A cold and late seasonal greetings to all our dedicated searchers; and we are hoping you all have started off this year well! We welcome you all back to our (now) traditionally late but unending devoted thread to recaping the monthly solves, news and going-ons within the** ***Lostwave*** **community. We have had a full house of solves during December, and we hope you all enjoyed each one of them. But, just before you read on make sure you give the wonderful Yuri's** [**recap of November**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pmw57d/monthly_recap_thread_november_has_come_november/) **a check out too!**

***This recap was written by myself (south\_pole\_ball), with collaboration with Skyat and with the help of many users from our associated Discord server! Now onto the main attractions! (***[**Discord Link**](https://discord.gg/UWfZCsWW)***)***

# ==- December's Most Notable Solves -==

\- [**Vivisect - Agoraphobia (1985)**](https://youtu.be/SdKY7iSud_0) **'Better Off Dead'** ([Solve Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pfatzk/better_off_dead_solved/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  
***(USA, Punk-Metal / Doom-Metal, 1985)***  
A fan favourite, previously to be believed, doom metal track that took December by storm by it's unexpected solve at the start of the month. After being advertised by *Discord* user **Centroid** to the 'samplespotters' *Facebook* group, group member **Timon Asteria** hurridly spent a couple hours looking at 'punk' releases from the 1985 in the *USA* on *Discogs*, until they fortunately found a match.

\- [**95:Nil - Full Beam (1995)**](https://youtu.be/yox4BLjZj2w) **'Paranoid Brown'** ([Solve Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pwx4lc/paranoid_brown_is_solved_lets_gooooooo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  
***(UK, Neo-Psychedelia / Alt-Rock, 1995)***  
Recorded from the French radio station—*Radio 666*, presumably at some point in 1990s by *WatZatSong?* user **CentralMuzik**. The original upload was an instrumental snippet with no further information, it wouldn't be for another 2 years, in 2023 that **CentralMuzik** returned and supplied the full song. And it would take close to another 3 years for *Discord* user **arin** to use YouTube's advanced search queries to find a similar sounding song called *S.G.L* by the band **Thule**, which had an almost identical 'melody and structure'. **Arin** had discovered that **Thule** had formed another band which had been named **94:Nil** and **96:Nil**, and additionally found a way to contact them. **Martin Byrne**, of all three bands, responded to **Arin**, stating that they were all the same band just renamed, and provided the correct identification as **95:Nil** \- *Full Beam*\*\*\*.\*\*\*

\- [**Manish Shukla - Jingle Bells, This Is Hell (2023)**](https://youtu.be/ASQOuyu5FoI) **'Jingle Bells, This Is Hell'** ([Solve Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pkp01r/jingle_bells_this_is_hell_was_solved_as_manish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  
***(USA, Festive-Pop / Parody, 2023)***  
Originally discovered through *Fiverr*, by *Discord* user **arin** whilst attempting to find the source of another *Lostwave* song (*That's What I Like About You*) in 2024. The animation was known to have been comissioned by *Fiverr* user **mnshukla**. During December of 2025, *Discord* user **LiamLimeLarm** reversed image searched mnshukla's profile picture, finding both a Linkdin and Instagram account of a person named **Manish Shukla**. *Discord* user **Alan** successfully got a response by **Manish** which confirmed that he was responsible for the song and that he had created it in 2023.

\- [**Made Them Lions - All I Want For Christmas Is You (2014\~)**](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s_-hzyh4oqE) **'All I Want For Christmas Is You'**  
***(Canada, Festive-Pop, 2014\~)***  
Recorded from a French-Canadian radio in 2024 by *WerZatSong?* user **YuritheSpaceman**. The song is a dual cover of the famous **Mariah Carey** song '*All I Want for Christmas is You,*' featuring both English and French lyrics. After one year and featuring for less than a day as *Fond My Mind*'s Christmas special song, *Discord* user espalier identified the song through the use of *onlineradiobox.com.*

# ==- Lostwave Promotional Posts -==

\- [**'Whatever the Season**'](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1q06jk5/unidentified_artist_whatever_the_season_late_1980s/) by u/[Rich-Ad-9696](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rich-Ad-9696/)  
***(Unknown, Funk, 1980s\~)***  
A funk track presumably from the 1980s originally posted by *WerZatSong?* user **Houston26**, who acquired the song itself from a *Dailymotion* video from 2008 by the user **V8SAFE**. Perhaps you know this catchy tune?

\- [**'What the Word'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pvmc9y/unknown_hardcore_punk_music_that_played_at_the/) by u/Massive_Towel_7936  
***(Brazil, Hardcore Punk, 1995\~)***  
A presumably rare Brazillian hardcore punk track that featured in the comedy / horror Brazillian film '*O Monstro Legume do Espaço*' (1995) directed by Petter Baiestorf. Maybe you can help identify this horrific mystery?

\- [**'The F-ing Egyptian'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1put2im/mystery_christmas_song/) by u/ibathedaily  
***(USA, Carol, 1980s\~)***  
A cute Christmas carol song recorded from a now forgotten radio channel from the USA in the 1980s. Half-way through we are abruptly interrupted by an unknown trucker lambasting insults at an another unknown Egyptian person. A new personal favourite Christmas unknown.

# ==- Lostwave Deep-Cuts & Classics -==

This is a new section that will focus on bringing attention to older Lostwave tracks, be it unsolved or solved. Mostly to show a little love to forgotten mysteries or accomplishments.

\- [**'First Time Ever (Unknown Remix)'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ssrAn1dwE) **(Unsolved)**  
***(UK, Trance / Techno, 1990s\~)***  
Originally recorded from the *Colin Dale Show* that aired on *Kiss 100FM*, a former London based radio station. *YouTube* user **PandorasEmptyBox** states that when they first recorded, presumably in the 90s, it via a cassette they had unfortunately tapped over the host citing the artist and name. Perhaps you could shed some light on this old mystery!

\- [**Cinema35 - Tonight (1980s\~)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDvpzKYHWeQ) **'Branimir's Instrumental December 2020'**  
***(UK, Synthpop, 1980s\~)***  
First appearing onto *YouTube* by fan favourite user **Barni** in 2020, the true origins were not located for another 5 years until *Discord* user **Mystic65** located it via WerZatSong. Now known to be originally posted within an 80s New Wave compilation by *YouTube* user **FarGo's Music** without a tracklist in 2014. This Synthpop track was identified by *Discord* user **RojoCatto** after locating it within a *Soundcloud* upload by user **MarcFord**.

\- [**Marc Liberman & Peter Paul - La Folie (1984)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJSjE_lcyXg) **'Julia Can Testify'**  
***(Austria, Disco / Funk, 1984)***  
Recorded by *YouTube* user **Benny P.**'s father in 1984 onto a cassette which it remained unknown until being posted by **Benny P.** in 2018. A futher 5 years this song would have to wait until *Discord* user **Randolurker** would correctly identify this funk track.

# ==- Lostwave Discussion -==

\- [**'Thoughts about mysterious music with partial identification'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1q0f5hw/thoughts_about_mysterious_music_with_partial/) by u/Siggigg97  
A prompt that pushed our Subreddit to revaluate our stance on Non-Lostwave music.

\- [**'What are some other absolutely SILLY theories we’ve had for lostwaves before they got solved?'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pyd68r/what_are_some_other_absolutely_silly_theories/) by u/Riadla_arerreh

# ==- Bodrick's Recommendations -==

**-**[ **Cults - Like I Do (2020)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lUgUt8aQ6k)  
***(USA, Alt-Rock, 2020)***  
A melodic but hard hitting alt-rock synth track, that has been on repeat for me recently.

**-** [**Nobukazu Takemura - Bright time to Come (1997)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXeBIecHjGk)  
***(Japan, Experimental, 1997)***  
Nobukazu transports you to a foreign world full of bright colours and wonder with this relatively obscure track from the late 90s Japan. A beautiful instrumental track that feels reminds you to hold onto the child like wonder of our artistic musical worlds.

[\- **M.O.T.O - Choking on your insides (From Ampeg Stud 1995) (2013)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF74bfmckQA)  
***(USA, Garage-Punk, 1995)***  
A violent blast from the late 90s, vibrating a message that is closely held true to many of us today unfortuantely.

1q5h0t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianMen/comments/1q5h0t7/guy_i_was_flirting_with_blocked_me_on_instagram/,Guy I was flirting with blocked me on Instagram after meeting — confused about what happened?,"I’m trying to understand a situation and would really appreciate outside perspectives.

I met this guy twice, very casually.
The first time was in **2024**. We’re from the same college (different sections). Back then, both of us were working in MNCs. Academically, I was a topper in college and got placed at a relatively high package. He was also placed at an above-average package. He is handsome, and I am beautiful too. I’m mentioning this only for background/context, not comparison.

We were already following each other on Instagram at that time. 
And he wanted to catchup and we met and  then 
 he showed interest, wanted to date me, and even planned a date. We also shared Spotify playlists, and our music match was around **98%**, which added to the sense of connection.

However, I rainchecked the date at the last moment because I was still in touch with my ex and felt emotionally conflicted. After that, we gradually lost touch. I also removed him from the shared Spotify playlist, and communication stopped.

Later in **2024**, he left his MNC job to prepare for government exams and i got to know later  In **2025** when he cleared **SBI PO**, and I congratulated him. There wasn’t much interaction after that. Sometimes he used replied on my story and flirts but i didn’t flirt back much. 

In **late December 2025 and early 2026**, we reconnected and started flirting again — very actively and i was flirting back too — on Instagram . Since we were already following each other from before, there was no new follow/unfollow dynamic. His account was public. We bonded over books, poetry, philosophy, and ideas. He mentioned that he was going on a trip, and I casually said that I had been planning to invite him to a New Year’s party. He said he now felt guilty about the trip and couldn’t wait to meet me. Since I was at my hometown and he was also going to be there for a few days, we decided to meet.

So we met again recently in the cafe. The meeting felt warm and comfortable. He opened doors for me, pulled out the chair, held my hand, and at one point fed me from his spoon. We also **shared a cold coffee from the same straw**, which felt intimate and natural in the moment, not forced. Overall, the interaction felt affectionate and respectful.

We discussed books like *Gunahon Ka Devta* and themes around love, sacrifice, and emotional responsibility. In that context, I said that if someone truly wants to let another person go, they shouldn’t stay in touch, and that to be a lover, you also have to be a fighter. This wasn’t directed at him personally — it was part of a broader discussion. 
Also i felt that he is preparing for Rbi since he was reading a Economics book by some famous Indian Author. 

He’s mentioned the first time before we met that “chivalry hasn’t died.” and Both times we met, he paid the bill. This time, I insisted on paying  said ki last time you paid full and i felt bad so He suggested I pay half, but I ended up paying the full amount because I was nervous , mera calculation chal hi nhi raha tha mind mai. 
Also while leaving he told me he will come to the city i am working to meet me and his friends are there too.

After that he posted a story of book to which 
I replied Sometimes sacrifice is just delayed expectations .. 
And he replied
Sacrifice is not good for anyone, the person sacrificing suffers and the person benefiting suffers the guilt

After all this, he suddenly **blocked me on Instagram** — no argument, no explanation. However, he did **not** block me on WhatsApp (I can still see his profile photo and status).



I’m not trying to chase or confront him. I genuinely want to understand:

Why did he block me?
