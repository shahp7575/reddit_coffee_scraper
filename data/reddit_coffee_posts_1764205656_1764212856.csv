I moved to a different state when I had about four months of sobriety, and I’ve been in my new place for about 9 months. When I first relocated, I made an effort to get phone numbers, and I got a home group and a sponsor right away. 

There are folks who I see at meetings regularly and text with sometimes outside of meetings. I’ve even gone out for ice cream/coffee/lunch with some of those folks. We get along fine, but I wouldn’t call them “friends.” 

My sponsor tells me that I need to find my AA crew so that I have support when hard things come up in life. I hear people in meetings talk about their sober support network, and share about how deep their friendships are with other sober people. I want to cultivate that, but I don’t know how. 

I am starting to realize that the issue is me. It’s not that I think I’m unlikable or anything like that — I think the issue is that I actually don’t know how to cultivate real friendships. In the past, my “friends” were basically just drinking buddies. Now that I’m sober, I have to let myself connect with people genuinely, instead of hiding behind alcohol. I’m a middle aged adult and I’m realizing that I don’t know how to make real friends. ",6,1764211918.0,alcoholicsanonymous,5,1.0,False
1p7r2n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1p7r2n9/alkemia_dark_mysteries_collection_review_and_a/,Alkemia Dark Mysteries Collection review (and a few others) ✨🔮,"So I got one small rollerball, one sample set and received two samples and freebies (thanks!) so here are my thoughts on those! For context, Alkemia tends to be like sort of a hit or miss for me? But two of my favorite scents ( The Honoured Ghosts and Silken Tent) are by them. I usually like aquatics and florals but I find, in my previous experiences, Alkemia has never worked for me in that way. Only weird gourmands I would not normally like 😅 
ANYWAYS on with the show ✨

Dark Mysteries Set :

*Encens d’ Amour: A sensual reverence of amber-benzoin incenses, Grecian figs, white peaches, black currants, green pumpkin, coconut water, vanilla pods, star jasmine, freesia, rosemary sprigs, ripe passionfruit, and medjool dates. 
  
Much Lighter than the other perfumes in the sample kit. The Fig is not that Green of a fig but a brighter variety, almost a true sweet (but not gourmand) fig. The black currants give a tart berry note, but the Rosemary sprigs adds a nice grounding earthy note. The coconut water doesn’t come through, nor the ripe passionfruit. I think the fig and the dates are giving “the filling of a fig newton cookie” but the incense and the rosemary keep it from being gourmand, but does give it that sort of “Alkemia Perfume Vibe” which I think is just maybe their incense notes? I would wear this as a cold weather perfume, but I don’t know if I like it enough to full size right now. 4/5 ⭐️


* Gods of Mad Desire: A delirium of hashish coffee, licorice, coriander, and trampled greens swirling in an erotic maelstrom of spices, black honey, goat milk caramel, dark amber, and patchouli 

First thoughts: getting the hashish coffee, licorice and coriander and it actually isn’t as bad as I thought it would be because overwhelmingly it is giving leather jacket and aftershave. Maybe that is the patchi notes, it is not really giving any greens, trampled or otherwise. I thought it would be more overwhelming, this Is not for me but if you like a unisex patchi perfume you’d maybe like this! I don’t get any black honey or goat milk caramel, or any caramel at all. I don’t think I am picking up on dark amber either, but those might be more pronounced after some time in a dark closet. I actually think if there was a tangy caramel note it would be overwhelming in a negative way, so I don’t mind what accords I am not getting. I am just overall not a patchouli wearer, as much as I wish I was.  It smells like barbershop-ish to me at the dry down, all the licorice left the party 🎈 2.5/5 ⭐️(for me, might be for you) 


* Kabarett: A debauched chypre of black leather, pipe tobacco, cigar smoke, worn wood stages, Cassis liqueur, Brazilian Rosewood, blood oranges, flambéed pears, wilted bouquets, wine-stained satin, tonka, and rare Gesha coffee.
    
Aggressive leather scent, like the car airfreshner type. I get pipe tobacco and it’s almost minty quality, but I do not get cigar smoke. I don’t get the coffee, oranges, pears or satin, wine-stained or otherwise. I do not like this, but I will try again after a rest in a dark closet,. X/5 (Needs to be reassessed after resting) 


* North Star: A powerful solitude of night-dark woods and resins, impassive stones, frozen lichens, the electrical crackle of Northern Lights, and the saliferous petrichor of dried tears.
  
Wow, what an interesting scent. I think the petrichor is a nice scent and is kind of a lighter intensity petrichor scent of the ones I have smelled. It’s kind of giving damp moss. Someone mentioned in a different review it having a “sour” note and I think I am sensing that in very brief whiffs but I don’t get sour as much as I get “salty”, sort of the salt around a margarita almost (sans citrus). I personally don’t love the moss scent, but if you are someone who likes the moss stone green lush sort of scent profile you’d probably like this. I don’t get as much of that Alkemia Perfume (tm) note in this one, and it reminds me a lot of their “boggy” or “marine floral” type perfume samples I have tried in the past “Lilacs along the winding drive” I don’t think I like that this perfume says “wet” and “damp” and not “frozen”.  I like the idea of this perfume more than the final product, but conceptually kudos because such a cool concept! 3/5 ⭐️

* Somnium: An eventide elixir of aromatics to bring deep relaxation and restful sleep – French lavender, green cardamon, neroli, Irish moss, vetiver root, and opopanax.    
 
Very very very deep lavender, not a clean candle light scent. Like it borders on medicinal but is brought back from the edge with moss. This is very deep and green. I don’t get the neroli until after the first smell and it almost enhances that medicinal quality into like, an old timey all-purpose cleaner. I have never smelled Opopanax by itself, only in amber accords so I can not comment on that, but I can take an educated guess and say its adding a really nice roundness to the final dry down.  I can see how this could work in very very cold weather because I think in the heat this would be really overpowering and just musky as hell but in crisp snow cold I think, on the right person (I.e. not me), this would be great. Even if it’s not for me, I think it’s well crafted. 2.5/5⭐️ 

* Venus in Furs:  A luxuriance of velvety fur-musk and boudoir incense infused cashmere wrapped in a risqué sophistication of dark Turkish roses, voluminous peonies, indolic white florals, elegant lychee martinis, and a twist of candied citron.
    
So, I didn’t think I would enjoy this but I am pleasantly surprised. The Turkish roses are almost like, mint green but with just a tinge of that really intense, heavy rose.I am getting the white florals as it dries down, I still think it is less white floral than say Gucci Bloom or something, but still more rose forward. The incense and the roses are kind of playing off each other, in a nice and interesting way. I feel like it’s a more playful and flirty perfume than I imagined it would be from just reading the notes? I don’t get lychee or lychee martinis, but I do get the candied citron and I think it keeps this perfume really in balance and it plays back off the rose. This is a perfume that floral haters will not be converted over on - it is intensely perfume-y. By the full dry down. If you’ve ever tried Alkemia, especially their florals you may recognize a “perfumed” quality to them? I don’t know how else to describe it - but this perfume has THAT quality in spades. I enjoy this a lot, and it’s a nice surprise but I would not buy it. I think it may be too rose and floral heavy before anyone could even notice the more subtle citrus and cashmere notes. 3.5/5 ⭐️


Rollerball of Aurora : 
Aurora: A luminscent skin-but-better aurora of soft cashmeran, orris root, cardamon infused coconut milk, white amber, white musk, white violet, white ginger, lotus flower, and a touch of honeyed cream.

Def getting the skin scent, getting a touch of spice from the cardamon and maybe orris root together that I thought was a patchatouilli note until I saw it didn’t have one. This is a very well balanced scent, like a less gourmand Silken Tent (probably the white musks and white amber notes), I can even get some of the honey cream notes in the dry down but again, not gourmand. I don’t think I would say this scent smells “cold” but instead “warm cozy blanket and warm milk inside while cold outside” vibes, although to be clear it isn’t lactonic and the coconut milk is almost giving it a suntan lotion note. All in all this is a nice scent, sort of confusing because it seems like it would be more of a Cold Day scent, but if you enjoy perfumes that hang close to your skin it would be a nice addition. I personally wish it leaned heavier into either smelling cozy warm or lactonic because it is kind of boring as is. The longevity isn’t really more than a few hours max, maybe even less for me. I think I will try this as a layering note if I can find other things in my collection it will play nice with. 
3.5/5 ⭐️

Extra samples given for free: 

Fallen Snow Angels: A paradox of crème de vanille and devilishly dark patchouli frolicking playfully amid a flurry of snowflakes and winter ice-mint.

Very light and delicate, I thought the patchouli would overpower it all but I would say it smells vaguely like a savannah buttermint or like those soft wedding mint candies. I like it, I think it does indeed as read winter-mint but avoids coming across toothpaste-y nor overly perfume-y. This would wear well on top of other skin hugging scents to give it a nice, sweet minty mix. I might wear it with Aurora and report back. 4.5/5 ⭐️- I would get a rollerball of this. 

Afterglow: A glowing veil of golden musk, Madagascar vanilla beans, woodsmoked black amber, chai tea, spiced rumcake, and incense woods.
	
At first, I am just getting incense wood musk. I am getting spiced cake and maybe the cinnamon and clove of a spiced rum, but I am not getting chai tea outside of that. I don’t get smoke but more burnt incense notes. I think the incense is overpowering everything in the dry down, which is a shame because I was really excited to try this and the chai tea note really interested me. I would say this is just a spicy incense woody scent. Not sweet at all, I would even say this leans masculine or like Old Spice or something. 2/5 ⭐️not for me, might be for you though!

I bought the holiday pack that comes with three flavors to try it out (especially now that the holidays are upon us). I’ll give an update once I’ve tried them.

This is the basic description of the product:

“Supergut GLP-1 Daily Support is a prebiotic fiber powder designed to support the body's natural production of GLP-1 hormones, which can help with appetite control and blood sugar regulation. It is made with a blend of resistant starches and beta-glucan, which are clinically shown to boost gut microbes. This unflavored powder can be added to a variety of foods and drinks, including water, coffee, oatmeal, or smoothies. For best results, start slowly and take it daily to improve digestion, satiety, and cravings.”",1,1764211652.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False

For context: I’m usually on top of birthdays. I’ve got reminders, calendars, alarms — the whole “I’m a functional adult (18M)” starter pack. Except apparently none of that matters when my brain decides to go on sabbatical.

Yesterday morning I’m sipping coffee (1M), scrolling through emails, enjoying the peace, when my wife (50F) walks into the kitchen and goes:

“So… when were you planning to say something to your son?”

I blink (0M). “About what?”

Her face drops the way a teacher’s (58F) does when a student (13M) says, “Wait… there was homework?”

She says, “It’s his BIRTHDAY.”

Reader, my soul *left* my body. I think I genuinely experienced astral projection.

I sprinted upstairs like a cartoon character, and there he was: my son, sitting on his bed (8M), quietly building Legos (92M) by himself like a tiny abandoned Victorian orphan. As soon as he looked up, I hit him with the most awkward, too-loud “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY!!” a man has ever produced.

To his credit, he just shrugged and said, “I thought maybe you were doing a surprise or something.”  
WHICH MADE IT WORSE.

Cue me panic-driving to the store, grabbing the saddest assortment of “celebration” items ever collected: a half-melted cake (0M), Minecraft (15M) napkins (we don’t own Minecraft), and a balloon (1F) that said “Congrats!” because there were no “Happy Birthday” ones left. The cashier (29M) wished *me* good luck.

We managed to salvage the day with pizza, cake, and me overcompensating like a guilty golden retriever (2F). My son said he had a great birthday, but I will be living with the shame until the end of time.

**TL;DR:** Forgot my son’s birthday, had to improvise a panic-fueled celebration, and discovered disappointment hurts 10x more when it’s in the shape of a small child holding Legos.",0,1764211536.0,tifu,21,0.14,False

I have been on this sub and looking at the coffee blogs and have no idea what the next best machine to get is, that won't cause issues.   
  
I just need a machine that will adjust for fine espresso.   
  
CHOICE (an Australian consumer group) rates the [Baratza Sette 270](https://www.choice.com.au/products/home-and-living/kitchen/coffee-machines/baratza-sette-270) as the top machine but it is too outside of my budget.

I have also found a Eureka Otto Semplice Coffee Grinder which has no reviews or information to it but a lot of people recommend other Eureka grinders. 

Also, a Precision GS2 (Espresso) Coffee Grinder or a Precision GSP Coffee Grinder could be an option but they don't seem to be around much.

I found the people in Afghanistan to be incredibly warm and all of the experiences I had with civilians there were positive. I remember these truck drivers would bring food to our base and they would ask our interpreter to ask us questions about ourselves, if we have kids ect and they were always super quick to show off pictures of their families and ask us about where we're from. I would offer them coffee from my thermos and they would offen offer me cigarettes and overall I look on that experience fondly. Another time these afghan construction workers came to our base to help reinforce a structure that had been damaged and me and another marine were tasked with supervising them every day they would offer me tea and lunch which I would decline. These experiences stuck with me because they have evey reason to hate me but have only showen me generosity. The second experience that sparked my curiosity is that my wife is a hair dresser and wanted to open up a studio but the prices were too expensive. My doctor is a older muslim man and we brought up in passing how expensive it is to open up a business and he offered to let my wife use this large spare room as a studio for free. We were really taken back by this generosity and a week ago moved in, she has been giving him home cooked brazilian food as a kind of payment as he will not take our money. This all has me wondering what is it about islam that instills this kind of generosity and why do you think many people in the US have the wrong idea about your religion.

Around 28, we were having significant issues and I felt very stuck. He wasn’t happy either. I offered counselling therapy to help, but he didn’t want to. 

At 29, I decided to go travel. I’d put it off for years as I was waiting for him to have enough money to come with me, as he said he wanted to, but he didn’t save. Initially it was planned for 3 months, but we ended up breaking up 5 weeks into my travel. The split was fairly amicable, mainly initiated by me, though later he said it was the right decision but he wouldn’t have done it himself. 

I ended up extended my travel to 11 months. We kept in touch as he would give me updates about our dog. He would often check in, trying to show me how much he’d changed. Sometimes I provided him with emotional support as he lost his job and had to live with his parents. He promised when I returned home we’d share custody of the dog. 

When I told him when I was coming home, in the final month, he decided he wanted a “clean break” and no contact except for special circumstances, and unfollowed/blocked me on everything except WhatsApp. He took the car and the dog, which I’ve partially accepted now.

It’s now five months since I returned home, and 14 months since we broke up. I’ve heard he’s in a new relationship and I’m happy for him to have moved on. We live in the same city and I saw him randomly from a distance with his new partner (I assume) a few weeks back for the first time since he dropped me off at the airport before I travelled, though he didn’t see me. 

I’ve moved on, truly. I’m in a much better place now. I’m in no way bitter about his new relationship and I don’t want to get back together. I know I should give closure to myself, but I want to meet him for a final time to say things to him in person. Maybe it’s naive/entitled, but I always thought that would happen and I didn’t expect the last time to see him to be at the airport. He took the dog from me and I feel like he’s controlled the ending. I’m worried about coming across each other again, except this time he sees me too. He was my best friend and partner for so many years. I thought about reaching out, offering a coffee, so at least it’s amicable. I don’t know what to do or how to let this go. I want to give him peace but I feel an overwhelming urge to ask to finally close this chapter of my life. 

How can I manage this? Please be kind.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

For years now iv been asking for personal items ie tech slippers ect not to be left in the living space. Fo context we are a family of 3 we have survived all the usual stuff lol (me f40 husband 42 fc 10.5 lol) but have spent the last decade living in a granny flat. A space made basically for one person to live. Like it's move the bowl to get ot the plate and put the bowl back because there's no space. Like my kitchen cabinet is over the kitchen sink yeah lol 6f by 5f just part of the open plan space. We're working towards building a house for at least 6 of the 10 years. Needless to say it can get tense in the space. 

Ok so I asked everyone to put stuff away...I'm told my stuff is everywhere and I'm the way.

Like really every is in the way of everything...

But anyway my 40th birthday weekend me and the husband have a argument (ever 3-4 years we have a serious relationship changing argument) 

Basically I have very few personal items in the shared space (we each have an area in the living space for some personal items I have pills for long term illness sct. ie a rack for shoes a shelf for tables and wires etc)

Ok so in the argument he informed me that the mop bucket ( the only thing that doesn't fit in the space for them items) is infact my personal items!!! WTAF so 5 years of him telling me I also leave items in the space he ment the freaking mop! 

  
Just soak that in, I took a couple of minutes, made a coffee and had some of the devals lettuce 😶😜 I came back to him and calmly screamed at him that in fact they are not mine they are house hold items like the mugs... And that he could use it at some point.. petty but hey.

I definitely could have kept my calm but it was years of being well unintentionally gass lit 🤷 

So 

  
I didn't post this when I originally typed it out (2 weeks later)

Update

we got drunk together and talked it out he is sorry ish but everything that isn't his is mine lol 

So... male thinking is there any happening lol 

And I have accepted some of the initial delays with the house is my fault. My mom died approximately 9 years ago so I was grieving hard and spending a fair amount on that lettuce and unusualy alcohol which affects my  Crohn's disease.

  
Unusually alcohol to the rescue lol

We both feel like the same thing.

Under appreciated, over looked and his father is a big misogynist hidden in New age hippy ideas lol is was hard to figure him out because we're very similar in so many ways (people say my husband married his father not his mother lol) 

Basically I'm on a journey to be less like the dad in law less to shout I just told him I don't shout by my home standards lol like when I screamed at him I was angry when I shout at you when you get annoying to stop but I'm just looking for attention to get you to stop I'm always getting stuff done with lol. 

Ok so a long one but for my first post was itaw

For putting my every essence into the screaming? It was definitely therapeutic. I usually get the release from small wins through the day so I don't unleash on him as soon as he gets home (I am staying home with our child I'm not capable of joining the workforce ATM. Haven't worked in 10 years I had a rough pregnancy and a very bad egg topic pregnancy with 3 surgers)

Maybe over sharing but context is key.

What do we think of this

How was you're grammer 😹😹

But I guess in crossing my limits or something Idk...
My husband is a nice husband tbh, so is my family, but I never felt like I can have some sort of peace anywhere. I always have to meet a certain criteria to just rest. For example at home the dishes have to be washed and anything visible to my husband that's not supposed to be there should be put away before I can go sit and maybe just get a sip of my coffee.
I had a pretty bad migraine today and my daughter got a fever too so I told my husband I'm going to my mums so I can rest a bit while everyone else takes care of my baby.... but I've noticed everyone being literally hateful now when I come... because there no place and I shouldn't come to stay and I shouldn't be sleeping in the same room that was mine before bruh..but yeah that's how it is now. Everyone saying omg here she is again even tho I rarely visit. I always thought of it as a joke but their expressions and seriousness about this matter is making my heart hurt a little....Even tho I have sjøgrens syndrome which makes my eyes completely unable to produce tears, got my eyes a lil teary. 

On the other hand, my husband does help me alot but he's always at home and doesn't work now and I'm the only one working, so instead of fully helping with household chores, he wait for me to come back to do everything. Let me just say he's gonna be back to work soon lol, but he's been home for a few months now. 
In the end if he was just to even let the mess my daughter causes just be there, I might not need to go to my mums and feel like an outsider all the time 

I didn't realise a day like this will come where I even question what am I to anyone at all.... should I expect nothing....? From people I'm wasting myself away for ...? Kinda mad ngl.

I just want to run away from everything but thn again, it wasn't so bad before so why now....

Nov 28, 2024... Thanksgiving at my sister's. Husband made his usual high-demand pumpkin gouda soup. Happy pictures. Countdown...

Dec 6, 2024...My last day of work, prior to retirement into disability. (ME/CFS, EDS, chronic complications.) Husband had been doing everything around the house (granted, I never could cook worth a ptthp) and it was time for me to stop sending my limited energy to the workplace and instead spend it on us.

Dec 9, 2024...He wished me ""Happy Monday!"" We laughed. I looked for a white elephant gift for my retirement gathering/final Christmas lunch. Found a Christmasy stuffed animal. Hubby: ""You can't give him away, he's cute!"" Took my last pix ever of husband--holding the stuffed animal. (I found a different white elephant.)

Dec 10, 2024...Retirement party. Coworker friend drove me there, and afterward, delivered me, buzzed, home to my laughing hubby. (I didn’t drink much, so when I did, it was entertaining.)

Up to Dec 24, 2024...Christmas prep. And he bought two bottles of our favorite wine for our New Years celebration. Talking about 2025 plans. Our usual 24th drive-around to see lights. Foggy, so not great.

Dec 25, 2024...We hosted family. Hubby made everything except the salad. And he'd  made more soup. That evening he says, ""Another successful Christmas!"" with a smile. Joyful. And it's such a relief I didn't have to work the next day--or ever!

Dec 26, 2024... Sister had stayed over. Her car was in the garage (he insisted) so his was in the driveway. I was sitting that morning with coffee and sister. Told her, ""This doesn't suck.""

**Time speeds up.**

...He goes out to his car; I think of something. (Now I dont even remember.) I call to him from house. He turns to respond. Slips. Hits head. We thought he was OK.
...Comes in with bad headache. He's on two blood thinners. I put coffee cup down and think, *""My lovely morning is shot. Please don't let it be worse than that.""*

It was.

-I drive him to the busy ER. ""Have a seat"". They brush aside my pleading. Twice. ""He's on the list."" And I **don't** jump up and down and scream.

-Instead, we sit. He's worse.

-Finally called--into a room with a woman on a computer. He throws up.

-Finally to an ER cubicle. He passes out. Pees. They finally take us seriously. Shoo me out. I wait. Again. My sister arrives.

-This ER is only Trauma III so they can't help.

-Flight to Trauma II is grounded. By the fog. The fucking fog.

-And...they're short of ambulances.

-Finally they get one, get him moving, and my sister drives me to the Trauma II where the surgeon finally meets us and says he could try but...my husband would spend the rest of his life in the nursing home. I have to let him go. 

We go home finally...to cheerful Christmas lights. Before we go in, I ask my sister to get the two bottles of wine for New Year's out if my sight.

She still has them. I'll never drink that wine again.

This Saturday they're forecasting a blizzard. If life was still about living, he and I would snuggle and watch out the big windows... I'll probably drink alone.

So now we have the last 2025 anniversaries and festivities that won't feel festive. Then it'll be 2026. He never even saw 2025. Unreal.
- Jan 17, 2025...his birthday. He never saw it.
- April 11 2025...our 10th wedding anniversary. This year will be our 11th. 

I want so much to be unconscious for 5 months. And it'd be fine to not wake up then either.

Thanks for reading. Don't know how I'd keep my sanity without all the ""strangers"" here who understand so well. 💙

Essentially, the 7.5 foot length and 5.5 fold width (the width in particular) of the bed are tripping me up.

I am in Munster, next to another major city Osnabruck, ​ in Germany.

Which wind brought me here?

Not exactly leading the invasion of Germany, in a reversal of the landing in Normandy during WW2.

Osnabruck  city's history goes back to 1648 where Peace of Westphalia was negotiated, bringing the 30 Years’ War to an end at the Town Hall..

In today's more peaceful world, Osnabrück is sold to tourists as the City of Peace,  and a UNESCO Geopark site.

In its own way, there is an element of romance, longing and even tragedy to the tale.

But we have to go back a bit to the very beginning.

How and why I am here.

The geography books will say the area or district is in the heart of Germany’s agriculture sector.

The buyer and users of the product I have been exporting by the container loads.

And the buyers have invited me to see for myself how the product is used in the fields.

They are our biggest market for the product I am selling to Europe. That’s not counting buyers from other German towns I have yet to meet. 

Then, add in buyers in Belgium and  France.

The story then was that I had a long road ahead of me during the trip.

In my own way, Bremen is my invasion beachhead, landing and launching pad of our product in Europe.

American servicemen who served in Europe, will remember Bremen well because their Command Center is in  Bremen and Bremerhaven.

The ports of Bremen (on the lower Weser River) and Bremerhaven (at the Weser estuary of the North Sea) were also placed under U.S. control.

And the airport where I landed in Bremen is the nearest city to Osnabruck, which has an international Airport.

Soon after landing, I was whisked off for a journey by car to our destination so we can beat  the looming darkness.  

Which was where I had fallen in love with German coffee.

Without an international hotel chain to put me in, my host had chosen an old cowshed, converted into a bed and breakfast, so I can experience the real German agricultural scene.

With winter approaching, it didn't take me long to be in dreamland after putting my head on the soft, fluffy pillows.

But  it was not the sound of  cows meowing outside in the fields that woke me up from my sleep. 

It was the strong, drifting smell of strong German coffee, being brewed fresh for our  breakfast by the BnB operator's wife.

It was a feeling that went straight to my nose and heart, which remains in my memory to this day.

It left me feeling of not being able to meet or come across another love in your life that you can compare with your first true love.

So, what is so different about German coffee, I asked the Germans I met subsequently.

' German coffee is unique due to its mild roast profile.

' It is less intense than other European coffee.

' The cultural emphasis is  on ""Kaffee und Kuchen"" (coffee and cake) as a social ritual. 

' It has been woven into German culture and its history as an innovator, including the invention of the coffee filter by [Melitta Bentz](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=Melitta+Bentz&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&mstk=AUtExfD_hkVPzSEV4TWwaxfzozJtkock0lSLiIqcECMus5Zpr1U1gxjLT2oTYmQvnt5BF4OFrXo6bsZa4OVhRBU_PrS8oS_-8qExCvN-GBDGxsXKZSMvJjscohuPixv7J5SK5uyl-EJmImVLmDeKyoaGe5IQabl2q5WoH8eCxjIMtslouWs&csui=3&ved=2ahUKEwiTlZv5qZCRAxWUUGwGHVrMGOUQgK4QegQIARAC). 

' German**s value high-quality coffee**, and Filterkaffee allows for precise control over the brewing processTrying to understand the German  obsession for drinking coffee takes my  mind to trying to understand the precision assembly of their Mercs and Porsche cars, not forgetting their war machines assembly line during their WW2 conquests.

Before leaving Bremen for my next stop in Germany, I was determined to keep my promise of meeting a British girl who I had years earlier, co-founded with me an unofficial singles club during her previous posting at her country’s embassy.

She had mentioned about starting a new job as an English teacher in Bremen, and to look her up when I do stop in the city..

**Osnabrück Garrison** in Osnabruck was a major British garrison with facilities located at Osnabrück in Lower Saxony and Münster in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

In a true confessional style, she said it was a move she made to be near her present ​English boyfriend who had also taken up a posting in the same school, and they planned to get married when their contracts ended.

This is our safe space and we live with a dog and a cat. 

Our best friend (23F), that we’ll call A., has always been jokingly our “baby”, because she’s younger than us. Now I think it’s gone too far. 

Now we have our own apartment but we lived in a room with 4 other flatmates until last year. 

When we were there, we often let her stay the night and sometimes multiple nights/weeks, because she was having arguments with her parents and having mental health issues (I have bipolar and BPD so I always had a soft spot for that). Even if we had a room and a dog, we managed to make it happen buying an inflatable mattress for her. 

Everything was pretty much ok, she “behaved” and even if it was hard on us as a couple we let her stay on multiple occasion to support her. I cooked for her and everything. We maybe coddled her, but as soon as she stopped being sick we stopped that behavior, even if we stayed very protective of her, as I think any good friend should.

The last few times she slept in our room were horrible. She was ok at this time. She snores and I have severe insomnia (this was another thing that I had to endure), plus she is ALWAYS extra cold. I developed a hormonal problem cause of my meds and so I was basically experiencing menopause. The only thing that kept me sane at night was keeping a window open, just one panel. 

Once she woke up at 7am (I went to sleep 2/3h before) and angrily closed it, then got in bed with me without asking (my gf was at work) and proceeded to go back to sleep and snore in my ear, so I just got up and left, knowing she would leave at 12pm. I was mad of course and complained to her, she claimed she didn’t remember any of it and apologised. But it was fine, it was one time. 

There were other incidents so we had to restrain the occasions we let her sleep in. 

Now, everytime she comes to our house is pure madness. 

One time she came and fell asleep on the couch, and she stayed. But it was fine, it’s just one time, I said to myself. 

Then the only other time we let her sleep here, knowingly, she:

- took her bleach dirty shirt (I cut and bleached her hair) and put it ON our living room armchair, bleaching the clothes underneath, aka my gf favorite hoodie that had sentimental value and the back of the armchair (we are renting, so yeah);

- melted our coffee machine handle (it was a moka, so cheap but still);

- bleached the only good towel we had left. 

That morning I recieved the texts of my gf that was devastated but didn’t wanna say anything (A. Was still at our house). I was too mad so I just stayed in our room and texted her that I was awake but too upset to come out of the room yet so i let her know. Later we discussed it and she was mortified. 

Now, me and my gf went to paris for three days and we had to leave our dog and kitten at home. Our dog was with the dogsitter the whole time, meanwhile she offered to stay at our house and watch the kitten, feed him and clean the litter. 

My gf said it was ok since she had two cats herself, so I said ok. 

When we got back, we discovered that:

- she cut herself with a bottle opener, she bled in the sheets during the night (it wasn’t serious tho), staining them;

- she turned on the radiators, with 15C degrees outside, leaving the bathroom floor flooded from the water inside them without telling us;

- she cleaned just the poop inside the litter, the whole sand was soaked in cat urine. It was a big muddy block that I had to scrub at 12am when I discovered it after a day of travel and complications, plus had to disinfect and wash the whole litterbox because that’s how cats get urinary infections and it was BAD;

- she asked us if she could invite over her mum (?)(?) to see the kitten (why would you think inviting a stranger into your bffs house when they’re away is ok??).

To add, I cooked for her every single meal and put great effort in it. It was specifically things she loved/requested and I did it with love. She never once told me what she ate and if she liked it, I had to ask. 

Also, when she comes over we have to basically gatekeep things from her because she’ll eat them/drink them/use them all and leave us with nothing. 

I have to also add that we are pretty much poor. We don’t have money for extra food, extra things-she-breaks/damages, and we are renting so if anything happens to the house, it’s a big problem. 

She knows all of that and after every incident we told her and she apologised. 

The other thing that hurts me is that sometimes I feel used. The last episode was a few months ago. 

I got stitches on my hand after a kitchen incident and spent 8h in the ER. This was after I confirmed with my nurse friend that it was a necessary trip. 

She calls us one day at 11pm, asking that we go to her house and take her to the ER because he hurt herself accidentally and needs stitches. Her father wasn’t home and she and her mother didn’t have the car. 

So I told her, since I had this horrible experience just a few weeks later, to send us a pic but she refused. Then I told her to call the ambulance (Our nurse friend works in ambulances, he was the one to tell us that is fine since it’s free and paid by the goverment exactly for situations like this), because they give you a first assessment that could avoid an unnecessary 5h trip to the ER and also give priority if the trip is needed (messed up system, ik). 

She told me “she didn’t wanna bother them”. So I got mad because why 1) aren’t you listening to me and my experience, 2) are you bothering us?? When there are ppl that will do it because it’s their literal job??

Plus the gas expense for us, the fact that it was late and we didn’t even know how they’d come back home, and my gf had to wake up early in the morning. 

She got angry saying that we should have just told her we didn’t want to. Then told us it wasn’t that serious. 

Idk, I’m feeling used, I’m feeling taken for granted. 

For the house, I genuinely don’t know how to act. She’s a grown adult and she shouldn’t damage our house everytime she’s here. But can we ban her?? It’s an absurd situation if you ask me. 

She also invited herself on new year’s eve and now we don’t know what to do, because she would be on her own if we refuse. I’m personally scared. My gf said she’s just immature because she doesn’t have her own house. But I don’t think that’s it and I’m so over it. 

What can I do? Am I overreacting? I’m genuinely at a loss here. She isn’t mean and she feels guilty when we point things out, but she doesn’t change. Idk what to do, I go from being mad to feeling guilty.

It was a big muddy block that I had to scrub at 12am when I discovered it after a day of travel and complications, plus had to disinfect and wash the whole litterbox because that’s how cats get urinary infections and it was BAD;

- she asked us if she could invite over her mum (?)(?) to see the kitten (why would you think inviting a stranger into your bffs house when they’re away is ok??).

To add, I cooked for her every single meal and put great effort in it. It was specifically things she loved/requested and I did it with love. She never once told me what she ate and if she liked it, I had to ask. 

Also, when she comes over we have to basically gatekeep things from her because she’ll eat them/drink them/use them all and leave us with nothing. 

I have to also add that we are pretty much poor. We don’t have money for extra food, extra things-she-breaks/damages, and we are renting so if anything happens to the house, it’s a big problem. 

She knows all of that and after every incident we told her and she apologised. 

The other thing that hurts me is that sometimes I feel used. The last episode was a few months ago. 

I got stitches on my hand after a kitchen incident and spent 8h in the ER. This was after I confirmed with my nurse friend that it was a necessary trip. 

She calls us one day at 11pm, asking that we go to her house and take her to the ER because he hurt herself accidentally and needs stitches. Her father wasn’t home and she and her mother didn’t have the car. 

So I told her, since I had this horrible experience just a few weeks later, to send us a pic but she refused. Then I told her to call the ambulance (Our nurse friend works in ambulances, he was the one to tell us that is fine since it’s free and paid by the goverment exactly for situations like this), because they give you a first assessment that could avoid an unnecessary 5h trip to the ER and also give priority if the trip is needed (messed up system, ik). 

She told me “she didn’t wanna bother them”. So I got mad because why 1) aren’t you listening to me and my experience, 2) are you bothering us?? When there are ppl that will do it because it’s their literal job??

Plus the gas expense for us, the fact that it was late and we didn’t even know how they’d come back home, and my gf had to wake up early in the morning. 

She got angry saying that we should have just told her we didn’t want to. Then told us it wasn’t that serious. 

Idk, I’m feeling used, I’m feeling taken for granted. 

For the house, I genuinely don’t know how to act. She’s a grown adult and she shouldn’t damage our house everytime she’s here. But can we ban her?? It’s an absurd situation if you ask me. 

She also invited herself on new year’s eve and now we don’t know what to do, because she would be on her own if we refuse. I’m personally scared. My gf said she’s just immature because she doesn’t have her own house. But I don’t think that’s it and I’m so over it. 

What can I do? Am I overreacting? I’m genuinely at a loss here. She isn’t mean and she feels guilty when we point things out, but she doesn’t change. Idk what to do, I go from being mad to feeling guilty.

This is our safe space and we live with a dog and a cat. 

Our best friend (23F), that we’ll call A., has always been jokingly our “baby”, because she’s younger than us. Now I think it’s gone too far. 

Now we have our own apartment but we lived in a room with 4 other flatmates until last year. 

When we were there, we often let her stay the night and sometimes multiple nights/weeks, because she was having arguments with her parents and having mental health issues (I have bipolar and BPD so I always had a soft spot for that). Even if we had a room and a dog, we managed to make it happen buying an inflatable mattress for her. 

Everything was pretty much ok, she “behaved” and even if it was hard on us as a couple we let her stay on multiple occasion to support her. I cooked for her and everything. We maybe coddled her, but as soon as she stopped being sick we stopped that behavior, even if we stayed very protective of her, as I think any good friend should.

The last few times she slept in our room were horrible. She was ok at this time. She snores and I have severe insomnia (this was another thing that I had to endure), plus she is ALWAYS extra cold. I developed a hormonal problem cause of my meds and so I was basically experiencing menopause. The only thing that kept me sane at night was keeping a window open, just one panel. 

Once she woke up at 7am (I went to sleep 2/3h before) and angrily closed it, then got in bed with me without asking (my gf was at work) and proceeded to go back to sleep and snore in my ear, so I just got up and left, knowing she would leave at 12pm. I was mad of course and complained to her, she claimed she didn’t remember any of it and apologised. But it was fine, it was one time. 

There were other incidents so we had to restrain the occasions we let her sleep in. 

Now, everytime she comes to our house is pure madness. 

One time she came and fell asleep on the couch, and she stayed. But it was fine, it’s just one time, I said to myself. 

Then the only other time we let her sleep here, knowingly, she:

- took her bleach dirty shirt (I cut and bleached her hair) and put it ON our living room armchair, bleaching the clothes underneath, aka my gf favorite hoodie that had sentimental value and the back of the armchair (we are renting, so yeah);

- melted our coffee machine handle (it was a moka, so cheap but still);

- bleached the only good towel we had left. 

That morning I recieved the texts of my gf that was devastated but didn’t wanna say anything (A. Was still at our house). I was too mad so I just stayed in our room and texted her that I was awake but too upset to come out of the room yet so i let her know. Later we discussed it and she was mortified. 

Now, me and my gf went to paris for three days and we had to leave our dog and kitten at home. Our dog was with the dogsitter the whole time, meanwhile she offered to stay at our house and watch the kitten, feed him and clean the litter. 

My gf said it was ok since she had two cats herself, so I said ok. 

When we got back, we discovered that:

- she cut herself with a bottle opener, she bled in the sheets during the night (it wasn’t serious tho), staining them;

- she turned on the radiators, with 15C degrees outside, leaving the bathroom floor flooded from the water inside them without telling us;

- she cleaned just the poop inside the litter, the whole sand was soaked in cat urine.

1p7qfc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1p7qfc1/the_regret_of_enjoying_an_ip/,The regret of enjoying an ip:,"I absolutely adore Tokyo ghoul. I played him for the voice acting when he came out, and stopped when he got bugged. I had millions of bp saved up for him, and got him p100. It was my favorite ip, a dream license, why shouldn't I? I would soon learn, and HOLY HELL did i learn. I usually kept the chat box closed, so i was oblivious to the actual death threats being spammed. Once I finally opened it, I stopped. I was having less and less fun playing him anyways, since I played almost exclusively with shackles + coffee, an off meta style. Being met with constant in game bm made the game super not fun, since when people didn't just throw the game right off the bat, they constantly bmed. 

Now: I main springtrap, as fnaf was another dream license, that i never actually expected to make it. Ive mained him pretty much since he came out. I decided to step back into ghoul for a bit, to see if I still had it. First game, 2 gave up. 2nd match, a genuinely good team who made me eat dirt. Of course, I was met with harassment, and just overall negativity. 

Conclusion: out of every game that featured licenses, this one seems to have zero sense of reasoning when it comes to things like this. You can love tg, and the only way to actually enjoy that is to completely disconnect yourself from any sort of social interaction in game. Yes, I hate vsing him too, but I don't send threats over it. 

Actual conclusion: next time you play vs a ghoul, just think for a sec before you decide to take it outside the game and make it personal. ",3,1764209801.0,deadbydaylight,16,0.71,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

1p7qcgn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7qcgn,Sandals Royal Bahamian Review,"Just left 4 nights at Royal Bahamian and we had a good time! We read *very* mixed reviews before coming (and were last minute pushed here due to the hurricane in Jamaica) so we were nervous. This was our 3rd Sandals experience.  We’re mid 30s, parents to young kiddos, not super hard to please. 

Long review ahead - quick notes:

Pros: smaller resort, private island is amazing, good food options, ~15 min ride to the resort

Cons: pool chair situation is a NIGHTMARE, staff isn’t the friendliest, couldn’t get any dinner reservations 

Overall, the resort is beautiful. It does seem a little worn, but mostly well taken care of. We spent 2 nights in an East Bay walkout room. The room itself was beautiful and updated, but it was SO noisy. Being close to the Club Sandals lobby area and the piano bar, the noise carried and we could hear people easily past 11pm.

The second 2 nights we were upgraded to a West Bay Penthouse Oceanview 1-bedroom suite. It was gorgeous. Super spacious, overlooking the ocean and west bay pool area. My only complaint was that the AC never really worked, room felt very muggy even after being checked by staff.

Food: 
Queens Pearl - fabulous bar food and Phillip the bartender is wonderful. Great spot to hang after dinner, chicken wings, mozz sticks, and bread pudding were delicious.

Soy - sushi was phenomenal. Our favorite restaurant while here. If you go to the sushi bar, the team will make you sushi not on the menu! 

Calico - great lunch. Casual outdoor setting. 

Tesoro - loved the pizza at lunch. Took a while, but the pizza was great. At dinner, they have a large antipasto bar with cheeses, meats, breads, salad, etc while you wait on dinner. The lamb chop and great flavor, was just a little dry. 

Gordon’s - weren’t overly impressed. The scallops appetizer had us wanting 10 more, but dinner itself was meh. The swordfish steak was bland, not warm, and the mashed potatoes felt like they were from a box. 

Aralia House - fabulous lunch on the private island. Jerk chicken had a great kick, good conch fritters. Be prepared for a bit of a wait as it’s the only food option for everyone on the island. 

Unfortunately, after trying to get reservations the day we arrived, nothing was available at La Plume, Butchs, or the hibachi restaurant. Huge bummer. 

We did do the Sandals returning guest dinner where we had surf and turf, and a yummy chocolate caramel brownie mousse cake. While the event itself felt a little cheesy, dinner was great. 

Pool:
Bottom line, if you’re not up at 630am putting towels on chairs, you won’t get seats by the pool. Chairs will be covered in towels all day without anyone there, but the staff doesn’t do anything about it. Butler coolers take up half of the pool deck and the other half are taken all day by early birds. 

The West Bay pool has more entertainment all day and loud music where the East Bay pool is definitely quiet and chill. We found the east bay pool to be much warmer as well with it getting more daytime sun (and seemed to actually be heated to a point). 

Overall, none of this will stop us from coming again, we already booked another trip for next summer, but there is definitely room for improvement. The staff overall seemed unhappy to be here, asking for things felt like an inconvenience, and it felt hard to find information… no room service phone number listed in our room, never received checkout paperwork, etc. ",4,1764209548.0,SandalsResorts,6,0.83,False

A month ago I M27 matched with a girl F26 who I'll call Charlotte on Hinge. We had great conversations every day. Had an initial FaceTime call a week in and went on a second date a week later to a coffee shop. Both of these times I thought we had a great time some fun banter and mostly just initial talk to get to know each other.

Last Sunday on November 27th I had planned a third date, picked her up from her apartment and went to dinner at a cute little cafe. During this date though the conversation didn't flow as smoothly. I talked a bit too much about myself at times but other than that I thought it went fine with no real red flags.

I want to preface that at this point from the beginning we never made out or did anything romantic except for a few hugs and light touches initiated by myself. My ideology is that I was not here to hookup so I held off a bit at least for the first two dates.

Continuing. We left the dinner and I drove us to mini golf. I payed for everything thus far but as I pulled out my wallet she put her money down and paid.. I thought it was sweet and didn't object.

I teased her a bit deciding if we should play on course 2 or 3 and we laughed a lot at this time. We decided not to keep score and just take turns having fun and chatting.

Here is where it all fell apart though. At one point I noticed that Charlotte started to hit my color ball, I teased her a bit about not paying attention and said ""oh no, do you have ADHD"". She did a quick nervous laugh and kind of got quiet. One hole later I kinda messed around and hit her color ball and she muttered along the lines of ... ""you must have ADHD"" a couple of holes later she was practically silent. Saying she was cold. We finished the game, made some parting talk and we went to my car for me to take her home. On the drive back to drop her off she said she was feeling sick and to drive a bit faster. Once I got home I texted her saying I had a great time and hope she feels better. She said that she appreciates me being calm and listening and she already feels better followed by a heart emoji.

Finally that morning I send my usual good morning text but she doesn't respond until later in the day with the dreaded text of saying that she didn't feel a spark, would like to meet other people and that we would be good friends... and that she did not appreciate me making the joke about if she had ADHD.

I kept my response very respectful and said that she was an amazing person but didn't want to be friends as I was interested in her romantically. I apologized profusely that I meant no offense by it and that I have been asked if I had it in the past by other women I've dated and so I incorporated it into my bank of questions I ask as I find I am incompatible with women with ADHD in the long term.

Following this her daily texts slowed way down, she said she needs her space and would like to meet other people. I suggested meeting up one last time for a third date to feel it out one last time if we feel a spark and to apologize to her in person ... she said no.

I wished her the best, removed her on Hinge, and won't bother her again. I left it open where if we want to try another date I am open to it one last time. I'm very bummed about this whole situation and want to not ruin it for the next relationship.

So Reddit. AITAH for joking/saying if she has ADHD? I use it as a screener question and it felt like a good time to ask it. I'm assuming she took it as ""do you think I have a disability?""... so I would like to know if I should just never ask this question at all? Or if I was being inappropriate.

My reasoning for why I even ask this question on a date: I ask this question because I have close friends that have ADHD and they freely tell me about the symptoms, difficulties and mechanisms and how it affects them in daily life. I have also dated women that have it as well... I find their bubbly personality very attractive and their hyper fixation in the first month is intoxicating especially in dating... me and Charlotte texted all day every day so I had a hint that she may be hyper fixating on me. For those that have dated, are currently dating or have read about ADHD partners with non ADHD partners, there seems to be a trend where once the hyper fixation wears off the relationship flips and in my experience becomes sour... I can't tell if a girl has it in the initial honeymoon stages of dating so this is why I bring up the question on dates.

Edit: You are all correct. I am 1000% the asshole and so much more. The girl is gone and has every right to be. My comment to her was very rude, disrespectful, distasteful and abhorrent. I apologize if I offended anyone who has ADHD and/or knows someone who has it. My knowledge about it is wrong and my little ""joke"" was ableist. I won't ever ask the question, or ever find it appropriate to do so at any point. This has all been a learning experience for me and I am correcting it going forward.",0,1764209497.0,AITAH,28,0.38,False
1p7qbud,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1p7qbud/gratitude/,Gratitude,"I’m grateful today…for too many things to list. From simple pleasures like coffee and dessert, to freedom, safety, family, my kids, and for God. I have so much to be grateful for. 

This year I have a new gratitude, and that is I am thankful for the gift of humility. Life has humbled me many times, but by the grace of God, I was finally able to see it this time around. 

I actually sat down the other night and I made a list of “convincers,” which are reasons why I should not drink. Before long, I was recalling horrific memories that I had long since suppressed, and among the many feelings that surfaced I was hit with a heavy dose of humility. 

I believe it is this humility that will make this time different from the other times… it will help me understand why I can’t have just one, and why I won’t allow alcohol to ever get a foothold on me again. 

I finally know what alcohol took away from me and the type of person I was when I was drinking. For that I am grateful. 

Happy thanksgiving 🍁

The idea came from Discworld's interpretation of Witches, and I loved the idea of writing them as a group that favors confidence and personal empowerment over magic.

—-Script Start



(speaker yawning) mm? Strange, this isn’t my bed.



\[rope tugging\]



(calm) Ropes around my legs and hands, holding me down in a chair. Cliche, but effective. (calls out) You there, in the shadows watching me, I assume you're responsible for tying me up?



…



Well at least you admit it, but the least you could do is step out of the shadows. You abducted me, I think seeing what you look like is a fair request. 



… 



No, I’m not particularly scared, but you seem to be; hiding back there. You have me tied up, why should you be afraid? 



… \[heavy footsteps\] <the speaker is now standing in front of the tied up listener>



(assured, confident) Ah yes, I recognize you now. Normally we’d be meeting at the checkout lane, having a quick chat before you run off like a shy little lamb. I’ll admit, I didn’t think you were capable of abducting me. Still, nice to see you again outside of work, even if I have some issues with the ambiance.



…



(chuckles, teasing) Deny it all you want, your face is all red. You're stumbling over your words now, just like you do whenever we spoke at check out. Plus, you didn’t bother hiding your face, or are you gonna say it’s some kind of evil twin situation? 



…



(amused) I’m still not scared, because I know you won’t lay a finger on me. I remember being asleep in bed, before waking up here. You took the time to safely capture me, and I am uninjured. If you actually wanted to hurt me, you would’ve done so already. 



…



(laughs) Threats tend to work better when you aren’t stammering, just a bit of advice. To be honest, it sounds adorable when you talk like that. 



…



(calm) I’m not trapped in a strange place, I know exactly where I am. Tied up, in a basement, by you. I may not know the details beyond that, but I know where I am specifically at this moment, and that’s what matters most, according to my coven.



(quoting)  Rule 32 of the Witches guide, ‘A Witch’s most powerful tool is her confidence. Know yourself and where you stand, everything else becomes as natural as breathing’. 



…



(nonchalant) Oh yes, a witch’s coven. Mine is rather small, but my sisters are all very wise. I’ve learned so much from them over the years. 



…



(amused) Ah, your eyes bulging in shock is honestly even more adorable than your stammering. But yes, I am a witch, in the flesh. I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out before, given you were  stalking me.



…



(scoffs) Please, you were clearly visiting the store every week to see me. And you were able to get into my house and carry me away, you had to have been watching me for a while to do that. My pet cat and broomstick collection didn’t set off any alarm bells? Or the giant cauldron I keep in the kitchen?



…



(chuckles) I think the cauldron is a bit much for ‘home decor’, little stalker. 



…



(Blunt) No, I won’t be doing a demonstration of my magic for you. 



…



(Calm) Because it’s not needed, frankly. I can tell by the look in your eyes, you believe me already. Furthermore, magic is dangerous, that’s one of the first things you learn in a Witch’s coven. We aren’t Warlocks, haphazardly slinging spells to try and turn sheep blue, only to blow ourselves up in the process. 



…



(Amused) Even so, that changes nothing about our situation. I know I don’t need to use a single spell to escape, nor do I want to escape.



… 



(Sigh) Because I want to ask, was kidnapping me really easier than just asking me out for coffee?



…



(laughs) there’s that red face of yours again. You know, you're lucky I’ve gotten used to translating your stammering through our talks at the store. So you say you want to charge my parents for a ransom? I call bullshit. 



(continued) I remember mentioning before, my relationship with my parents wasn’t great right now. And If you like me enough to stalk me, you would have remembered that. So it’s cute that you're making shit up to hide your feelings, but it won’t work.



(slightly annoyed) Is admitting you have a crush on me really that difficult? I may be a witch, but I didn’t think I was that scary. (sincere, but joking) I promise, I wouldn’t turn you into a toad or anything, just for asking me out.



…



(sigh) If I wasn’t interested, I would’ve said no, and things would’ve been awkward for a little while, but we’d both move on eventually. You can’t force someone to say yes to a date, I think you know that deep down. You just need to try, and accept whatever happens.



… 



(calm) Maybe you kidnapped me out of fear, but I can tell by the lack of conviction in your voice, you know this wasn’t right. Threatening me and abducting me, really isn’t going to make me love you. 



Oh sure, maybe if it was someone with less confidence, and afraid for their life. Maybe, (emphasized) maybe they would agree to ‘love’ you for the sake of survival… But deep down, you and I both know that wouldn’t be real love, right? 



That knowledge would eat away at you, slowly breaking your heart while they’re dying on the inside from fear… It’s not a scenario that ends well for anyone in the long run. (reciting) Witch’s law #42-’you can’t force someone to love you, not with magic or by force.’



…



(empathetic) And I can tell by looking at you, this isn’t something you're proud of. Shot in the dark, you don’t have a lot of experience asking people out, do you?



…



(gentle) Ah, so you never really asked a casual acquaintance out before. That would explain the stammering and fear, but where did you get the idea of kidnapping me from? 



…



(understanding) I know what ASMR roleplay is. My coven sister Kiera listened to a lot of comfort audios when she was suffering from depression. I’m guessing you listened to a lot of Yandere stuff, then?



…



(chuckles) A fun fantasy, but not really something to build a relationship on. Try to remember that in the future, alright? 



…



(confused) Well, I’m not reporting you to the cops or anything like that. I’m uninjured, and this was all clearly just a big misunderstanding caused by your anxiety. Are you gonna kidnap me, or anyone else again? 



 …



(laughs) I can only imagine the amount of prep work you had to put into this. Not to mention the food cost and concealing my abduction from the cops. You’ve got a large set of stress bangles under your eyes. But the work load isn’t the only reason you won’t do it again, right?



(leading the listener) Finish this sentence, ‘I will not kidnap people and force them to love me because-?”



…



(repeating listener) “Because it’s bad, and I regret kidnapping (speaker name)!”



\[Clapping\]



(praising gently) Very good! Now you're getting it, good job! Don’t be embarrassed, just take it on the chin and move on. You learned an important lesson, and took a step towards being a better person. Much better than my last stalker.



…



(casually ominous) Oh yeah, I had another stalker before you. Total raving lunatic, tried to physically grab me, threatening me online, the whole nine yards. I turned them into a fish, currently residing in Headmistress Helena’s aquarium until they learn to behave themselves. 



…



(light laugh/giggle) Aw, your eyes are popping again. Don’t worry, I knew you weren’t that kind of  lunatic. I’ve enjoyed our conversations at the store, and I always saw you going to help people who were struggling, even when you were watching me. You were clearly just shy and insecure, and it unfortunately got out of hand.



(gentle) Sometimes, we make mistakes. I remember back when I started as a witch, I gave my rival at work a skin rash that lasted for two weeks. The headmistress really let me have it after that one, I swear she went on for 3 hours about the importance of restraint and emotional maturity. 



<the speaker scooches the chair forward>



(gentle, but stern) You made a big mistake, had it explained to you, and now you feel bad. That’s just life, screwing up and trying to do better. In fact, do you mind untying me? 



\[gentle unbinding/unraveling of ropes\]



(chuckle) Good boy/girl, thank you. Although judging by that look in your eye, it seems like you still have something on your mind.



…



(gentle) Valid concern, some people do only change because someone else holds power over them. It’s possible you're only listening to me, because I could overpower you if I wanted. But the thing is, you chose to listen. Some people don’t even get that far in the process.



The fact you respected me, regretted this from the start, and let me go, while agreeing not to do it again? That tells me what kind of person you are deep down. A human, flawed, but only needing a gentle scolding to change. And I really do think you're a good person, just driven to do something bad by the fear of loneliness. I know you’ll do better from now on, cause I’ve seen the type of person you can be otherwise, and I like that person, a lot. 



…



(gently) You're welcome, think nothing of it. 



\[awkward silence\]



(breaking awkward silence) Sooooo, what was gonna be your sales pitch?



…



(playful) Your sales pitch! You know-your big love confession, excessive praise and worship, meant to make me believe we were ‘soulmates destined to be together’. Telling me how wonderful and perfect I am. The whole song and dance, I wanna hear it.



…



(laugh) Don’t be embarrassed, you had to have had it planned out. So come on, tell me!



… <Longer pause>



(touched) I’ll push back on you saying ‘love’, we don’t know each other that well after all, stalking aside. But thanks, I really do appreciate all the sweet words. I can tell you really meant all of that, from the bottom of that big soft heart of yours. 



…



(laughs) You're welcome, but you aren’t off the hook just yet. I think I have the right to make a request, seeing as you inconvenienced me on my day off.



… \[heavy footsteps as the speaker approaches to intimidate the listener\]



(teasing, start threatening, but end as playful\] For your punishment, you wicked, lowly, naughty human. I want you… to buy me a coffee and a scone.



… 



(loud laugh) Well, yeah! (affectionate) I’d say you won me over with that sappy confession. But the truth is, I’ve liked you for a while, dork. I was just waiting on you to ask me out first, even if you were taking a while. Given the way you kept striking up a conversation with me at the store, I figured that was what you wanted. 



… 



(touched) I’m not particularly traditional about ‘who asks who’ out. I just figured you wanted to do it. But since you are seemingly too shy to ask… Do you wanna go out on a coffee date with me? 



…



(warm, affectionate) Good, we can work on your confidence later. As for when, how about we go right now? It’s still early in the day, so we have plenty of time to get some coffee and chat. Or tea, whichever you prefer. 



…



(gentle, teasing) No need to worry about getting changed. 



\[finger snap, magic sounds, ambiance of people chatting\]



…



(nonchalant, casual) Oh that? Just a quick teleportation and fashion spell. I hope you don’t mind, but I put you in that outfit you wore two weeks ago. I thought it was a really good look for you. 



…



(chuckles) You’ll catch flies if you leave your jaw hanging like that. I told you I was a witch, didn’t I?



…



(laughing) Well, I don’t like to overuse magic, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to give you a small demonstration of what a witch can do, when she puts her mind to it.



(gentle, flirty/teasing) So, shall we then, you cute lil dork? Show me you can show a witch a good time, without the rope.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Iowa Hawkeyes vs. Grand Canyon Antelopes: A Statistical Circus with a Clear Juggernaut**

**Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (And Neither Will Iowa)**  
Let’s cut to the numbers, because in this matchup, the odds scream louder than a coach’s pregame speech. Iowa (-8.5) is a near-unanimous favorite across bookmakers, with decimal odds of \~1.23 (implying a 81.3% chance to win). Grand Canyon, priced at 4.3, implies a 23.3% chance—a statistical long shot that makes a blindfolded toddler’s three-point contest hopes look optimistic. The total is set at 143.5 points, a line that assumes both teams will play chess with a 10-second time limit.

Why the gulf? Iowa’s +143 scoring differential (23.8 PPG) is the statistical equivalent of a superhero’s “I’m faster than a speeding bullet” moment. They shoot .550 FG% (3rd nationally)—imagine if your coffee had a 55% chance of being perfect every morning. Grand Canyon, meanwhile, makes just 6.2 threes per game (308th in the country), which is like bringing a spoon to a barbecue.

**Digest the News: Antelopes in the Headlights**  
Iowa’s 6-0 start is a fairy tale for Hawkeye fans. Their 86-74 win over Grand Canyon in the 2021 NCAA Tournament? A historical footnote that reads like a “We did this before, buddy—remember?” moment for the team. Coach Ben McCollum joins an elite club of Hawkeye coaches with six straight wins to open a tenure, a feat achieved by one other coach (Dr. Tom Davis) in 1986. Let’s just say the program’s “hot start” isn’t boiling quite yet—it’s already at a simmering 212°F.

Grand Canyon, meanwhile, is a work in progress. Coached by Bryce Drew (a man whose basketball bloodline could fill a family tree with NBA branches), the Antelopes are 4-2 but flatter than a pancake in the Mountain West. Their +8.0 PPG differential pales next to Iowa’s +23.8, and their 71.3 PPG allowed? A statistical middle finger to the concept of defense. Oh, and they’re making 2.0 fewer threes per game

January, 6 -

So I finally got that job, so know this blog wont be just music and racing posts, its nothing special and the pay is decent, after months of struggling with enterviews and dealing applications its nice to settle down even for a bit.

Its a relatively small building on the end of the industrial park, strange for a company that deals with food, but hey im not there to judge, they gave me a ThinkPad and, belive or not, my own office wich is pretty neat guess ill have to do some decorating on the way!

So I've finally done with the decorating,  nothing to special but it does fills like a nice place, its important since ill spend half of my entire day here, the job is pretty mundane, create some spreadsheets, keep track of the shipments and others, make sure the costumers get their products, pretty standard corporate job.

Theres around  10 or 15 people here i don’t know  for sure since I only have access to the first and ground floor, the building by itself has 3 floors, on the ground floors there's your standard reception, lounge and kitchen , here on the first floor there's the offices, a few bathrooms a cool down area and a coffe table ( the coffe tastes like dirt but hey it takes you through the day) The second and the third one are elevator access only, wich is strange since the first floor is accessed via the stairs directly from the lounge, i only saw 3 people enter the elevator since I started working here, i dont know their names, but they were some pretty fancy outfits, they must be the directors or lawyers i don't know maybe if I get promoted enough I cant see whats up there.

March, 7 -

So I've worked here for around a month, getting used with the flow, and the people, we have Jake from the neighbor office room, hes the usual work friend, he share some good memes laughts way to loudly and im pretty sure he speends more time watching  streams them working, theres jade the receptionist, she has the greenest eyes you have ever seen shes also very white she almost looks sick most of the time, shes quiet but really  nice and sweet i guess i understand why the people than come here like her so kuch theres Roberta from the kitchen, lovely woman she cooks like a Michelin star cook, wouldn't be surprised if she got one, and there's ron hows our supervisor,  hes an older guy i think around 50 - 60, he's a pain in the ass sometimes but overall hes the stereotypical manager with the most intense smell of eucalyptus i ever met, an workaholic, who appears to love his work mor than his family he has the biggest office on our floor and its covered in glass panels but every one of than has a reflective tint so you never know whats happening,  and its also has some sound isolation,  i dont have any idea why a supervisor from a food imports company  would need that level of privacy  but im not paid enough to ask that kind of questions.

March, 13 -

So it's been a while since I updated you guys. This is what happened these past months: we received some visits. The same people I saw entering the elevator that one time, but this? This was different. They came in a black sedan, which, okay, I know this sounds like the start of some cheesy action movie, but it's the truth. Then they came, entered Ron's office, and stayed there for three whole hours. I tried to focus, but his office is right in front of mine, and I couldn't keep my eyes off the door. It was just a strange meeting all around. After that, they entered the elevator, and I swear I did not see them leave. When I clocked out, their car was not there, and Jade said they left around 5 PM. Strange, since I never saw them leaving the elevator, and the elevator is not available on the ground floor, only on the first. This was only one of the strange things.

The other thing was, I noticed one specific shipment. It arrives every other Thursday, and it's apparently a big cargo, but I have no idea what it is. Every other cargo has a description, either apples, rice, sometimes cutlery, and other stuff, but this one? Nada—no description at all. Of course, I still count it. Maybe it's personal cargo for the owner of the company or something. Since we're in the industrial park, the truck unloads the containers here, and then another company takes them for delivery. I never looked much at them before, but I started to look more once I noticed these ""ghost"" shipments. I don't see any obviously strange containers, like a black one or one with a skull painted on the side of it, so I guess it's just some normal shipment at the end of the day.

March, 27 -

So I had to stay late yesterday. There were some shipments that arrived without the proper paperwork, and I had to rush to process them. Otherwise, we would lose the cargo. I don't know what the repercussions would be, but I didn't want to find out. So I did the required part, but I needed Ron's signature. Ron called in sick for the first time in years, Jade said. She was also there late, so she was sitting upstairs with me. We were just chatting, nothing special, as I said before  I need Ron's signature but thanshe said:

- just go into his office,  he has a stamp of his signature,  or at least he had one, i can grab the key for you

- I, i don't think that would be a good idea, I never entered his office since I started here and I don't think entering now would be good

- I mean its not like he's going to magically appear, plus you just need to enter stamp the notice and leave, nothing that will take more than 1 minute.

I don't know if I should've just, have allowed the cargo to be extradited or something,  but Jade had been there for so long I don't think she would lie about something like that,  so I listened to her, grabbed the spare keys to Ron's office and went there, this was the first time i had ever gotten that close to his door, when I sent my application I did all my enterviews via Skype and the person who talked to me was in a totally different building, I guess even state since the number was a bit strange, the key to Ron's office was nothing special your standard door key, but I didn't however took note of the little tag hanging to it ""conference room 1"", as far I know Ron had been working here for 10 years why would his keys  be named conference room? I ignored that for now and entered his room.

I was immediately hit by the smell of eucalyptus, Ron had a strange obsession with incense and essential oils, he has this overwhelming smell  whenever he walks by so I was not surprised by his office smelling like that, they room was lit by the moonlight, I'm used to walking with the lights off so it was no problem and it was a quick job, I approached his table even in the dark I could see it was a really really nice table clearly was a bit expensive,  actually I got that idea from his entire room, expensive, I was a bit surprised if didn't expect Ron to earn that much but I guess after working 10 years here he would've gotten a few raises, I shook myself from the distractions and opened his drawer,  yes Jade was correct there it was the stamp, I quickly grabbed it and stamped the paper, whoever once I was about to put it back in the drawer something caught my eye, a folder, a red folder with a small symbol on its cover, a it looked like a trident, i couldn't see that clearly,  damn it i should've  turned the lights on, I stared at it for a second than I heard:

- Isaac? Is everything alright in there?

- Oh yes I found the stamp getting out 

I closed the drawer and left quickly, locked it, and gave the key back to Jade. Then I ran to the yard to finally deliver that paper that I'm sure was Jake's job to file.

April, 25 -

I thought once the end of the month was here the work would calm down but I was extremely wrong, we were working double time, shipments and orders coming left and right  everyone was busy,  I even saw Jake working for once,  how i know it? I heard him screaming every ten minutes or so:

- GOD DAMMIT I'M NOT BIULD FOR THIS 

- You sure aren't Jake, guess if you actually worked you would know how to handle it

- Hey once my crypto coin launches I'm going to be so rich ill buy this company and you'll have your work for me!

- yeah yeah sure, just fill the papers ok? Even Jade is working more than you 

That is basically a description of how the hole day work, today everyone stayed late, we ordered some coffee and a cake to eat on or 10pm break, we were siting in the lounge watching the view of the front of the building, the industrial park was, a nice place belive it or not, it was incredibly plain from one point to the other, there were some nice trees and bushes to break the gray of the concrete floor,  there where some warehouses a bit further , from the shipping company which the docks weren't that further away, our building had the entire entrance to the ground floor in glass so we could se everything,  on the first floor  there's were some windows and of course the block of glass also known as Ron's office,  but then there's the fun part for the 2 and 3 floor? There were no windows,  just a cold concrete wall on the four sides till the top, our building was a mix of those boring minimalistic McDonald's and that one gigantic monolith of concrete in the upper floors, it just add for the mystery of those levels.

- maybe they have servers to spy on the Chinese 

- oh of course jake, we, a food company would have servers to spy on the Chinese 

- Hey maybe we have who knows what happens up there.

Jade and I rolled our eyes, yet again he came with those conspiracies theories, I went outside to stretch a bit , and felt the cold breeze hit me right in the face, one of the downsides of working in such a plain space, the cold,  then I noticed something,  right on the end of our container line was Ron, smoking , hey guess that makes sense of why he's so enfactuated with essential oils, he appeared ti be on a phone call, I dont know what he was talking,  but I di remember him smacking the containers,  like a dealer proudly selling a car, I guess that type of attitude got him that position I guess, I went back and we all went to finish our shift to finally go home.

 Jake gave me a ride, his car is not a Porsche but its definitely faster than my electric scooter, when we were passing  the containers I noticed something, on the back of the container were Ron was standing earlier, there was a symbol , a trident shaped symbol, i only saw it from a glance as jake was speeding down the central lane to the entrance,  but that image keeps appearing in my head, its definitely the same symbol I saw in the black book at Ron's drawer, but it looks so familiar, yes I know from where I saw that its the Greek letter,  Psi, but why the hell would this one container have a Greek letter instead of the normal numbers?.

May, 1 -

I came to work still thinking about that cargo container, so today I decided to check it, after my lunch break started I went there to take a closer look,  and yes definitely thats the Psi symbol,  so I grabbed my phone to take a photo of it when I felt a strong grip on my shoulder:

- Found something interesting son?

For someone that appeared so lazy Ron had an unexpected amount of strength, outside of that strong cigarette smell, I don't know which is worse, this or the synthetic eucalyptus smell.

- oh nothing just... taking some pictures to add to my spreadsheet of containers this way well have better control from our windows 

- oh I see, maybe you could send me that spreadsheets once youre done with it 

- oh of course ill send you right away

 He stared a me, eyeing me from head to toe  than he let go of his gorilla grip and went walking back to his smoking place.

- Just finish it quickly and get back to work will ya!

Great now I have to take a picture of every dumb container in this lot because of that dumb excuse.



May, 8 -

These past weeks I've seen a growth in the numbers of the Psi containers bought,  from one every Thursday,  i just received an order for 10 shipments of it. This   like 9% growth or something. I did some digging and found that outside of physics, Psi is also sometimes used to represent life. Either Google and my old Greek books were lying to me, or are we buying livestock?

But that doesn't even make sense. We mainly order fruits and vegetables, not livestock, and even if it were that, that container was definitely not a livestock container. Today I had to stay late again. Ron was locked in his office. Jade, as usual, was helping us on the first floor,  but I used the excuse of using the bathroom and went to one of the containers marked with the Psi symbol. I put my ear on it, maybe expecting to hear cows or something, but I only heard a weird hum, like that of a fluorescent light or something similar. Maybe I should try to see that notebook again.

May, 15 -

So today the suits arrived and went up the elevator with Ron. Seizing the opportunity, I rushed into his office. Miraculously, it wasn't locked. I went straight to his drawer,  but once I opened it, the notebook was nowhere to be seen. Maybe he took it with him?

- Goddammit!

As I closed the drawer, I looked up to leave. During the day, and with the lights on, his room was definitely more visible. I could see the polished dark wood floor and all the furniture. But I noticed something I hadn't during  my ""secret mission"": on the wall to the left of the door frame,  that same goddamn symbol, this time red, on a black wooden frame. I left  and closed the door, going back to my office.

After two hours, the suits and Ron came back. I peeked at them from the top of my monitor,  and yes, he was definitely holding that notebook, all black and with the red Psi symbol. They entered his room and locked the door. I need to find out what's happening.

May, 22 -

Yet again, the shipments grew to 20 this week. Funny enough, the other shipments also grew, as if someone was trying to hide what's happening—a smokescreen...

I just feel like there's to much happening all at once, maybe I'm overtinking, maybe is just a normal shipment I don't known , Dolores made us hot chocolate today, I swear that woman is an angel on earth, after work Jake took me and Jade to a bar, its the first time I ever went to one, just saw in movies and Netflix series 

- Would you look at that Isaac out side in the wild, quick someone take a picture 

- oh I already did is in our group chat

- ha ha very funny you two

- hey Isaac you've been pretty...quiet lately,  like more than what you normally are what gives?

-Jade you've been working there for more than any of us...what does suit guys come to do?

- oh, well since I started they just come here te man ask to see Ron, I usually give him a call an they meet at the elevator 

- wait the elevator? 

- jade yes on the ground floor 

- but there's no....

- hey you to love birds can you stop talking about work I didn't buy both of you beers for nothing 

Jake said as he pulled me to the snooker table, I don't drink so I switched the beer for some juice, I know pretty lame, but my sleep schedule is alredy in shambles I cannot afford to be hungover.

But what did jade mean by elevator on the ground floor, I distinctly remember looking  all over it once I got there, I was to lazy to take the stairs  i never saw an elevator dor anywhere, maybe it was a few of the beers she drank, but maybe....

May, 23 - 

Today is the first day I called in sick, I feel my entire back hurt, I should've let Jake there on the floor instead of carrying him to the car, but I know my consciousness wouldn't let me sleep after that, Jade joked that was some sort of hero carrying the Damsel in distress,  but I felt more like atlas holding the earth from all that weight.

Not to say I was not ""productive "" per sat its the first time in a while I had time to play some games and sleep a bit, but in the afternoon that symbol came back into my mind, i started to search about it everywhere,  Wikipedia, the internet archive, YouTube, and even reddit of all places, I searched for conspiracies maybe secret government projects,  anything  anything that could satiate my hunger for any knowledge of it.

I came across a conspiracy that the Psi is used by the US government to mark secrect or highly  sensitive  shipments like weapons or  nuclear stuff, well that would've explained the humming, but in that case I would probably be feeling bad right know,  I honestly gave up at that point  I was starting to look like jake with the conspiracies

Ill try to get some sleep so I can work tomorrow.

June, 12 -

The past weeks have been busy, each Thursday more cargo would arrive and as usual the number of Psi containers grew, I was genuinely curious  so i asked Ron about the increase of the shipments.

- Oh boy we just closed a Big contract with who else with the US government were now the may suppliers for a lot of the army barracks across the world

- oh so we all should be getting a raise them

- hum ill talk with the chairman about that

- oh... ok then  thanks Ron 

- yeah yeah now get your ass back to work and stop  bothering my coffee break 

The chairman? Maybe that's whats on the upper floors I imagine, as i was going back to my office at stopped at Jake's door 

- hey man, who's the papers?

- I don't know if can't take all this numbers

- hey your the one that picked this task

- yeah yeah but at least the pay is good for whatever this is

 I laughed,  even tho jake was...difficult some times he was still a great guy deep down, somewhere inside that belly around the half digested donuts or pretzels .

As I got back to work I got drowned in the numbers and the spreadsheets so much I didn't noticed the hours passing.

- hey Isaac earth calling

- oh yes Ron?

- finish this work and head home ok? Everyone is already out, even Jade went home already 

- oh okay sir I'm almost done

I didn't even noticed that it was already 6pm guess i was to distracted, as i was packing my things  i remembered....the notebook! Now was the perfect time for me to grab it, I rushed to the door of the office as I checked to make sure everyone had left, I entered it, went directly to the drawer without second thoughts and opened  it, there it was, the notebook,  I finally could've had the answer I so desperately wanted, I grabbed it and sat under the table just to be cautious,  than I used my phone as a improvised headlamp.

The cover was leather the book appeared to be very very expensive,  I could now see the Psi symbol very clearly the color a very, vivid red almost as if taken directly out of an Oled display with the contrast maxed out, as I turned the pages i felt that soft almost silk like paper, oh yes this thing was definitely expensive, I don't know what I expected,  maybe direct shipments named , or what the cargo meant , anything,  everything  was got was coded 

""US-FSA18 - 8 -$100.000 ""
""US-MSA15 - 6 - $90.000""
""US-FSA15 - 10 - $200.000""
""US-MS - 1 - $1.000.000""

I swear I worked with excel with all my life, and I don't have any idea of what any of that could mean, there were pages and more pages filled with that sort of code, dating back to 1953, maybe the gun theory wasn't that far fetched this entire thing  as far as my quick calculations went could sum up to 3 trillion dollars.

I was feeling my heart almost jump out of my chest, what type of company did I even join?, I quickly took pictures of all the pages and put the book back in its place and ran out of there, I quickly grabbed  my backpack, locked everything  as if nothing had happened and went home, when I got there I immediately made a copy of the pictures to and HD i had lying on my bedroom,  that thing was finally useful outside of recording xbox 360 clips.

June, 14 -

I would be lying if I said I could concentrate this past days, after opening that book, those codes, its all that has been on my mind specially  that lest shipment US-SM... what could be that expensive? I spent the entire afternoon searching weapons, ships, planes, jets, even experimental stuff, nothing and i mean nothing matched that, neither the first codes , I'm genuinely lots, my head hurts , i feel like quiting,  i don't know what we do, but I don't feel like taking part in it.

June, 23 -

Today i was again distant,  my mind rushing with possibilities of what any of that could mean those codes, the symbol the containers, something had to make sense, something,  anything..

- hello Isaac?

 I look up from my plate I hadn't eaten anything  yet but there she was, Jade staring down at me

- don't tell me you think Roberts's food taste bad , oh she's going to hit you all the way to Mexico 

- thats kind of racist

- oh come on, so whats on your mind? Do I look good there too?
- you know not everything revolves around you right? I was just thinking...hey by the way, what was that about the elevator you were talking  at the bar?

- ....the elevator on the first floor? What gives?

- No no you said there was also an elevator shaft here on the ground floor

- Isaac i think you were drunk or someone put something in your drink, there's no elevator here on the ground floor 

No, no i will not go insane I remember it, she said the ground floor right? Or am I going paranoid and creating my own recollection of events.

- yeah... yeah your right 

 I watched she walk way, did she really say first floor? That questioned echoed on my mind through the hole day, I was not crazy.

June, 26 -

Late at night again, 7pm, Yet another big shipment, another batch of the Psi Containers, this time i couldn't take my eyes away from them, something was strange about them, i don't have any idea what they are or whats inside but I can't see them as just "" normal"" anymore, is still my job so I went back to my spreadsheet sheet, than for the first time that useless windows news feed was useful for something,  apparently  a discord server named USFG got into some legal trouble for stalking a boy band singer or something but that wasn't the interesting part, but the name was.

-USFG, hum, United States Fan girls,pff what a corny name... wait...USF

As I read those initials time and time again I grabbed a piece of paper and started  to write, any combination that could possibly make sense

""USF - United States Farlands?""
""USF - United States Foxtrot?""

- no this isn't a video game PMC name think Isaac think!

Than it clicked, everything,  the Psi,  the symbol, the code,  ""Life""

""US-FSA18 - United States: Female Shipment, Age 18""

People....there were people in those containers...

June, 26 - 8pm

I never rushed down a set of stairs so quickly in my life, the 50 steps turned into 25, the echo of the polished stone flor and the hard concrete walls  I rushed outside, I was never much of a runner but the adrenaline had me moving faster than I ever thought I could, I got to one of the containers and started to bagging on its door

- HEY ANYONE THERE? HEY! SOMEONE ANSWERED ME! 

Nothing no answer,  I stared at the door obviously it had a big padlock, they wouldn't  be stupid to leave it unlocked, I searched for anything I could use to smash that thing, I found a medium sized rock, it was heavy, but I didn't care i smashed the rock against the lock, once, twice,  on the third hit I hear a loud bang as the metal shackles around the containers handles broke, I opened  it and was blinded by a strong red light, similar to those used to reveal photos back in the day, that red light against the previous dark of the night was a bit blinding at first, and what I saw inside...that blinded me mentally.

There inside that cursed container,  were three young women, I guess between 18 and 19 , shackled to the floor of the container,  breathing softly as to preserve the very little oxygen they had, from the inside I noticed some small windows on top of the container invisible from the outside and hidden from my view of the window, thats how they had at least air, on the ground a few water bottles and US Army Field Rations, so they wouldn't die during the travel.

- W-Wait I'm going to call for help
 As I reached to grab my phone,that had felt to the ground after the hole rock picking thing, I felt something  hard hit me in the back of my head, its felt immediately,  I couldn't see much, it was all spinning, I could only heard the doors of the container being locked again, I think I heard two men talking,  but I do remember one thing,  the strong smell of eucalyptus.

June, ?? -

I woke up, I was tied  to a chair, my head hurt like crazy, I was set on a dark room I could not see anything, I kept turning my head looking for something,  but the only thing any of my senses could notice was the smell.

- So...this is how you'd expect to get that raise? Poking at the cargo of our finest client?

I was sweating,  a mixture of fear , the urge to scream and curse at Ron for letting any of that to happen.

- oh so your all quiet now, guess your not curious anymore 

-w-what?...

Even talking hurt, I guess i hit my jaw once I fell to the ground 

- Oh come on Isaac do you really think I wouldn't have a way of knowing you'd get into my room? Poke into my stuff? At first I guess you would be stupid as to actually grab the notebook,  maybe is just the stamp I thought,  maybe that kid is just a normal office worker,  but no your as curious as the others, but you? You went to far

I had to many questions, what he mean by the others? What does he mean when he says he saw me poke around there, his room dosent have cameras,  matter fact nowhere inside our building had any sort of cameras , just on the outside, as much as I wanted to asked all those questions I sat there, quiet, Ron had an ego, If I stayed quiet that would force him to answer my questions himself.

- oh so now you won't poke around, search for your god damn answers? Okay them 

I could  smell he approaching me, God i can not dream of eucalyptus ever again, he took a blind fold off me, I had to blink a few times to adjust myself to the low light, it was definitely  a room, by the cold and the roughness of the floor , concrete in was inside a concrete ""box""

- d-did you really  have to take my shoes?

- that ,boy, should  be the least of your worries,  what did you expect,  that you a simple office worker would be some sort of hero?

- I....I didn't 

-  Sure, but now I have to somehow get rid of you, you're our biggest HR problem right now

- well... didn't we sign a NDA?

He smacked me, maybe he had Italian lineage, that was a good mafia slap

- This isn't no joke, this isn't any games, you messed up with the toys of powerful people,  I risked my eyes trying to ignore it , heck even to keep you kids safe, but you had to ruin everything!

His phone rang, God I never heard what an irritating noise, it echoed trough the room, my ears hurt, my head hurts, I want to scape, I should've  when I had the change.

I heard him stepping out of the room, his yelling on the phone was actually useful for once, as he walked away I could sort of imagine the layout of where I was, there's the room I'm in, one in front, and I guess there should be another two on the same disposition to my right, maybe this where the 2 or even the 3 floor, I could only guess.

The room was finally quiet,  I could almost hear my heart, if not for a faint, humming, like if a generator was set in a room next to mine.

- what...is that god damn noise...

June, ?? - 3 hour later?

I've been rubbing one hope to another in the hopes of maybe,  maybe if the friction is enough they'll  snap, its not like I'm in any rush, that humming is still there,  I guess that is the worst part, is driving my insane, its like a needle piercing to my skull almost reaching my soul, its constant, quiet enough so its not incredibly noticeable,  but still loud enough to pester you, Ron walked by a few times, he comes, take a glance at me like his disappointment or something,  and than he leaves.

The rope finally got thin enough, I tried to snap it, it hurt, I guess i should've went to the gym when I had the chance, but I broke free, I waited for a few seconds before actually standing up, maybe i was afraid Ron would appear out of that dark hallway,  I knew I could outrun him, but what if he had a gun? Or if there Were other people with him? He did mention others. No, I didn't have time for overthinking right now.

I kept running,  turning left, right,  left, right, like some sort of game, like I was a mouse inside a maze. This place was incredibly huge, rooms and more rooms, filled with archives, chairs, and conference rooms. But it was strange, too big to be one of the floors of the building. Each floor could hold at most 8 rooms; this appeared to go for miles and miles. I stopped. I needed to catch my breath. I had been running for God knows how long, but at least I wasn't followed until now.

As I leaned against the wall, I could finally breathe for a second. Outside of my own breath  and sweat dropping to the floor,  I could still hear the humming. This time, however,  it was louder. I gathered strength to get up, and as quietly as I possibly could, I started following  the noise. Maybe it was some sort of generator that could lead me to an exit.

As I walked i started to notice the small details that I couldn't see before,  my assumption was correct there floors were indeed concrete,  however  this time I was able to see that it was painted, a strong , but dull red color , there were strange marks on the wall, symbols, other Greek letters I imagine, all painted in black, I kept  following the humming and the closer I got to it, the more symbols appeared in the wall.

- what the hell is happening in this place.....

The humming grew louder and louder,  I could almost feel my entire  body trembling from that noise, as I got closer it got so strong it felt like an earthquake, the humming lead me to a door, a huge black and gold, marble door, it appeared to be 4m tall , and at least 2m wide on both parts of it, in the middle there was a sort of keypad, of course at it appears to be such an obsession with them, Greek letters were in the place of your standard numbers.

- Great 
I had absolutely no clue of what the code could be, from mere assumption I could guess the Psi symbol would most certainly be part of it, it appears as the sole mark of this hole conspiracy.

- think Isaac, Psi means life what else would this guys be interested in

I started testing combinations

""ψ + β + λ - wrong""
""λ + μ + σ - wrong""

I kept trying and trying  but nothing made sense, I started looking at the walls for clues,  obviously there were no golden symbols giving me a hint, that humming was starting to bother me, I needed to know what was behind that god damn door, than as if by some Devine message, I got an idea

""Α + Ψ + Ω - correct""

- this is cheesy as hell...

I put my hand on the door, the marble was....hot? How could that even be Possible. I pushed it. It was definitely as heavy as it seemed to be. As I finished opening both doors, nothing on Earth could've prepared me for what was inside.

""US-MS - United States - Mammon Shrine""

June, ?? - 

The room was filled with a red light. The walls,  white marble with gold accents, held gold pieces, diamonds, emeralds, and chalices. In the middle, there was a pool. The clean water appeared strange  in the red light, but I didn't care. I rushed to it and drank it. To my surprise, it didn't taste like pool water at all. It was sweet and refreshing,  like drinking from a well. As I used both my hands to drink and wash my face, I saw a little reflection in the corner of my eye. There, on the side of the pool, was a ceremonial knife as big as a child's forearm. I recoiled, looking around frantically. Maybe there was someone else there teasing me.

God... I wish I was wrong. There, at the far end of the room, lay a statue. Its throne, black marble adorned with gold and diamonds, held a fat figure. Its body was made of gold, and its face could more similarly be described as an orc, its horns big and twisted like a mountain goat's.

- holly....shit.....

A god damn demon, that was making the humming,  I never saw anything like that in my life , I never saw that horrendous thing  ever before, I could not stand there, I could feel its eyes piercing me as if at any moment  he could get up and squash me or worse, I ran, I didn't even bother to close the door I ran as fast as I could than I saw it at the end of the hallway,  an elevator.

1p7q5hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p7q5hp/why_smart_people_often_pull_away_from_social_life/,why smart people often pull away from social life (and it’s not what you think),"Ever noticed how some of the most intelligent people you know tend to avoid parties, group chats, or even just casual coffee hangs? Like, they’re not shy or antisocial, but somehow... they just don’t care enough to show up. This isn’t just a quirky personality trait, and it’s definitely not a superiority complex either. It’s a real, research-backed pattern that many high-IQ individuals display, and it’s becoming more visible as we dig deeper into social behavior and cognitive needs.

I kept seeing pop-psych content on TikTok and Instagram that basically says “smart people hate people” or “introverts are just better,” but that stuff’s reductionist and honestly pretty cringe. So I went down a rabbit hole, books, peer-reviewed research, YouTube lectures, longform podcasts, and what I found blew my mind. It’s not that intelligent people are “above” human interaction. It’s that certain types of socializing actually disrupt their cognitive rhythm, their sense of purpose, and their internal reward systems.

Here’s a deep breakdown of why many intelligent people withdraw socially, and what we can learn from it.

---

* **Smarter brains crave solitude like dopamine**  
  Psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa did a study published in the British Journal of Psychology (2016) that looked at happiness levels across intelligence and social frequency. The finding? Intelligent individuals are *less* happy when socializing frequently. The explanation goes deep: evolutionarily, highly intelligent people are wired to think long-term and abstract, not just deal with immediate social cues. So a Friday night out might light up the average person’s brain. But for someone more cognitively inclined, it actually feels like an interruption.  
  *This doesn’t mean they hate people. It means their reward system is calibrated differently.*

* **They need longer cognitive “loading times”**  
  Socializing requires rapid micro-decisions, emotional mirroring, and real-time processing. For high-IQ minds, which often function in deeper, more layered thought structures, it’s like alt-tabbing from a render-heavy program into a fast-paced shooter. The switch is jarring. Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer famously said that “the more intelligent a person is, the more they prefer to be alone.” He wasn’t glamorizing isolation. He was pointing out that solitude lets intelligent minds think fully, without being interrupted every ten seconds by small talk or groupthink.

* **They’re often more sensitive to low-stimulus noise**  
  Emotional intelligence doesn’t always scale with cognitive intelligence. That means some high-IQ minds can be hypersensitive to things others ignore, like fake laughter, empty pleasantries, performative friendship. This is something explored in high detail in Susan Cain’s *Quiet*, where she dissects how deep thinkers are quickly overstimulated by shallow input. It’s not ego. It’s neurobiology.

---

So how should smart people create a healthy connection to the world without draining themselves? Here are some tools, resources, and mind upgrades I found insanely helpful.

- **Books**

  * **“The Wisdom of Insecurity” by Alan Watts**  
    This is easily one of the best philosophy-life books I’ve ever read. Watts, a British philosopher known for translating Eastern ideas into Western language, shows how overthinking is actually a fear of impermanence. Super relevant if you're the type whose brain never shuts off. It made me rethink what it means to be mentally ""stable"" and why some people crave social noise just to feel alive. *This book will make you question everything you think you know about peace, purpose, and presence.*
  
  * **“The Drama of the Gifted Child” by Alice Miller**  
    A cult classic from a world-renowned psychoanalyst. It’s technically about childhood trauma, but the deeper layer is about why gifted people often feel alienated and can’t relate to others emotionally. It’s a wild read. You get slapped with truth every other page. *Probably the best book I’ve read on why smart people feel emotionally underfed in social group settings.*

- **Podcasts**

  * **Lex Fridman Podcast (especially episode w/ Naval Ravikant)**  
    Lex is probably the best host alive for deep-thinking introverts. Naval talks about happiness, meaning, and why smart people often prefer long silences over fast talk.  
    This episode reframed intelligence as a spiritual tool, not just an intellectual flex.

  * **Modern Wisdom by Chris Williamson**  
    Tons of gold in this one. Especially episodes exploring loneliness, dopamine systems, and mental bandwidth. Highly recommend his convo with Cal Newport on deep work and social distraction.

- **Apps/Tools**

  * *BeFreed*  
    As someone with ADHD, I’ve always struggled to finish books or even follow long podcast episodes. After graduation I rarely read more than a few chapters before bouncing. But a Columbia friend put me on to BeFreed, and now I’m hooked. It’s a smart audio learning app where you can ask it literally anything you’re curious about, like “why do smart people isolate themselves” or “how to build emotional stamina”, and it creates a hyper-personalized podcast-style lesson just for you. It pulls from expert sources, books, and research papers.  
    What I love: you can choose how deep you wanna go. Sometimes I go for the quick 10-min summary. Other times I choose the deep-dive with more examples and stories. You can even change the voice. I set mine to this smooth, dark-humored tone, it makes learning weirdly addictive. It’s my go-to whenever I’m burnt out mentally but still want to learn without scrolling TikTok for 2 hours straight.

  * *Ash* (Mental health journaling for thinkers)  
    Ash is a journaling app but built around structured psychological prompts. Not just mood tracking but actual reflection prompts like “What are you avoiding emotionally?” or “Describe a time your intelligence got misread as arrogance.” You can even pick the evidence-based therapy framework (CBT, ACT, etc). Helps a LOT if you tend to overthink and spiral but don’t want to just “vent.”

  * *MasterClass*  
    Not just for cooking. The course with Neil Gaiman on storytelling or Cornel West on philosophy gave me that rare feeling of mental intimacy without needing to talk to anyone. Sometimes the best connection comes from being understood silently, and these classes are that.

  * *YouTube: Einzelgänger*  
    Amazing philosophy channel that breaks down Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Laozi, and even Jung, usually in 10-minute, well-animated videos. One of the few channels that respects your intelligence but doesn’t overcomplicate things. His “Why Intelligent People Prefer To Be Alone” video is essential.

---

It’s not that intelligent people don’t care about others. They just care differently. They run on a different operating system, one that rewards depth over volume, solitude over stimulation, truth over trend.

Solitude isn’t loneliness. And silence isn’t social failure. Some minds just work better when the noise turns off.",4,1764208958.0,OdysseyBookClub,2,1.0,False

I’m sorry I don’t know how to link it but it is in my post history. But I have an update and am more confused than i was before unfortunately.

I found out thru a mutual that a few years ago when bf and I were about 6 months in, on a night i was away he went to a bar he knew his female coworker would be at because he wanted to see her. Just showed up, no provocation, and told her he was hoping she would be there. On top of this for most of their friendship he never told her about me at all. Update is below. 

Funny enough she reached out to him. It was sort of a happy holidays/sorry things went sour between us/i miss our friendship sort of thing and she mentioned grabbing coffee next time he is in her city. Nothing romantic or sexual but she did talk like they were pretty close friends at one point which I don’t like because I know about all his other female friends (mostly they are from school and most are married so I don’t worry about them). No I don’t normally look through his phone but we were sitting right next to each other and he got an email notification and just had this weird look on his face. So I dug in and asked about the info I already had and is this her, and what happened between them and all of that. But then this is what makes me feel weirder- he told me he wouldn’t reply and then he blocked her on two random social medias that she didn’t even use to contact him. Idk, it felt like a panic response. Something about it I can’t put my finger on. Because if she was just a regular friend who fell out touch why not just give a polite reply if he didn’t want to rekindle the friendship? You know, like a brush off. She said she was sorry for something between them but idk what, and if she did something to be sorry about why does he care so much to have this reaction. It’s not that I want him palling around with her but wouldn’t a simple “hey (name), it’s nice to hear from you. No hard feelings at all, I’ve been super busy so maybe next time I’m in town”. I don’t know, such a strong reaction feels off to me. In my mind people don’t normally just go no contact unless the person is really bothering them and as far as I know she’s reached out only once? 

Right now I don’t even know what to think. I’m glad in a way this happened because it gave me an excuse to bring it up without sounding crazy. And sure I’m glad I guess he blocked her and doesn’t plan to see her but idk something about his reaction being that strong threw me off. And I still dont know if anything happened between them at the bar, or what she’s “sorry” for.

Forgot how good it feels,"I went camping over the weekend with a couple of friends. Nothing too much, just a quiet spot, a few tents, and a lot of snacks. It’s been a while since I did the whole overnight thing, and I forgot how nice it is to just sit around a fire doing absolutely nothing. We brought the usual gear: sleeping bags, portable stove, folding chairs. One friend showed up with a car tent setup, it’s  basically a canopy that attaches to the back of the vehicle and looked like one of those pictures you’d get straight off alibaba. It looked a bit overkill at first, but it ended up being useful when it rained. We huddled under it and made noodles while waiting for the weather to chill out.

The rest of the trip was smooth. No major bugs, no gear failures, and nobody forgot anything important. We did a short hike, saw some birds, and spent way too long trying to get a fire going with damp wood. Classic stuff. I didn’t take many photos, but I did come back with a solid sunburn and a deeper appreciation for instant coffee. Might do another trip next month if the weather holds.

If you haven’t camped in a while, I recommend it. Doesn’t have to be anything fancy, just get outside, bring snacks, and don’t forget the bug spray.",5,1764208325.0,ontariocamping,1,0.73,False
1p7pxii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7pxii,AIO: My childhood/best friend ghosted me for months.,"To give some context about our relationship: I am F-29 years old, and my best friend is F-30 years old, and we had been best friends since we were kids (since I was in diapers). We stayed close throughout elementary school and even into our college years. We ended up going to different schools growing up, and during college, we became more long-distance. I stayed in our hometown in the West Coast, while she moved across the country to the East Coast.

We’ve had our ups and downs, but every time we reconnected, it always felt like no time had passed. Looking back, I think the root of our disagreements was that I often felt she wasn’t there for me when I needed her, even though she was that person for her other friends or people she cared about.

One of our biggest disagreements happened during COVID. At the time, I was living with my then boyfriend - let’s call him B - and the two of them had bonded over baking. Anytime B and I argued, he would always go to her and tell her everything. One of those times was when B and I broke up but decided to stay friends because of his dog.

One day, I went over to his place to see the dog while he was out of town. He knew I would be visiting, as we had spoken on the phone briefly a few hours earlier. He had an external keypad lock on the door, and I didn’t realize it automatically locked as soon as it closed - it wasn’t like that when I was living there. I stepped outside to grab the leftover mail without my phone and ended up completely locked out. He hadn’t told me the lock auto-locked, and the code I used to have had been changed, so I had no way of getting back in. Eventually, I remembered the back door was still open, so I tried climbing the huge fence - and I’m only 5'1"", so it was a whole ordeal. After everything, I finally got back inside, called him, and we ended up arguing because I was exhausted, stressed, and overwhelmed.

Maybe I was wrong to be upset, maybe I wasn’t - but I was overwhelmed and reacting in the moment.

Right after the whole thing, I went home, and my best friend called me. We were chatting normally until she suddenly brought up the argument - because B had texted her about it. I told her I didn’t want to talk about it, but she kept pushing, so I explained what happened. Instead of supporting me, she ended up reprimanding me for how I reacted. I was completely hurt and disappointed because I expected my friend to have my back, not take his side. Even if we agreed to disagree, I still didn’t feel supported by her. After that, we ended up going no contact for over a year.

Then one day in December, out of nowhere, I got a random text saying, “Hope I’m not overstepping, but I’ll be home soon and was wondering if you’d want to grab coffee or something.” (1st screenshot) I didn’t even have her number saved anymore, but I figured it was her. I agreed, and we met. We talked about the fight, and the funny thing is - she didn’t even remember it. I explained what happened, and she acknowledged that she hadn’t been the best friend to me, and that she understood I needed things from our friendship that she hadn’t been giving. Everything felt resolved, and after that, we spent time together catching each other up over year. (2nd screenshot).

When she went back to the East Coast, we stayed in contact. Eventually, we planned a trip for me to visit her during May. I was there for about a week with her - the trip was fun and exciting, especially because it was my first time there. When I got back home, we kept in touch for a while, but then she slowly went MIA for about a month (3rd screenshot). Eventually, she told me she was moving and said she’d reach out once she was settled (4th screenshot).

A couple of months passed with no word. My birthday (in October) came and went - still nothing. It hurt not hearing from her, but I tried not to take it personally. I even texted her asking if everything was okay, and still got no reply. So I let it go, and a couple more months passed by (5th screenshot).

Then one day recently, I checked my Find Me location and saw she was back in our hometown - without saying a single word to me. That’s when I started texting. I didn’t take it well, and I regret how I reacted, but I felt extremely hurt, confused, and disappointed. I genuinely thought we were on good terms, so her completely ghosting me was hurtful.

After trying to call and text multiple times, she finally replied. Her message made me even more upset - mostly because I was already beyond hurt. So I reacted the way I did (6th and final screenshot). I regret not apologizing for how I responded and for not respecting her boundaries, but at the same time, I felt like… how else was I supposed to get any clarity? I wanted an answer, and it felt like she wasn’t even willing to acknowledge me.

I consider myself a loyal, loving friend. I’ve always been someone who cares deeply and shows up for the people I let into my life. So it really stung that someone I gave that privilege to treated me this way. Am I overreacting??

**ADD ON:** I just want to say thank you to everyone who’s responded, whether it was positive or negative. It genuinely helps me to read different perspectives, and I think it’s been good for me to release my thoughts somewhere.",2,1764208293.0,AmIOverreacting,19,0.75,False
1p7pxeu,https://v.redd.it/r2lp40hwgp3g1,Tried to recreate a 70s Tarantino style crime scene using a new drama engine. The vibe is surprisingly accurate.,"I have been watching a lot of classic cinema recently and kept having these ideas about replicating famous directing styles like Tarantino. I randomly signed up for this creative inspiration tool called DramaLand to see if it could actually handle that specific aesthetic.

I just put in a prompt about a 70s era crime solving show where the first scene of season one takes place in a coffee shop. It honestly surprised me because it instantly set up the whole world building and character design and script and even the shot breakdown.

The result was pretty magical because it felt way more cohesive than just generating a random video clip. I am already working on generating the next act to see if I can keep the consistency.

If anyone is interested I will drop the waitlist link in the comments so you can grab it. I would love to see what other directors styles you guys can replicate.",1,1764208285.0,AIGeneratedArt,1,1.0,False

Cant find anywhere in bay area for so long.I am sharing my experience with below locations in my quest to find such a cake, these are good locations but dont seem to have it:

Tous le jours: Cloud cake feels like eating clouds for 9 bucks, very very pricey for what you get no satisfaction in the end. Non-cloud cake option is also far from resembling traditional choc cake

Paris B: Same as above, does not feel like anything when you eat it, very unsweet and light for a cake

La Patisserie: Taste was 7/10 before but went downhill after 2021, they rarely have pure choc cake these days. It comes mixed with berries or coffee. Also I saw something that made me question their hygeine so stayed away since

85 degree: no choc cake option, other flavors are unique but nothing like traditional cake slices

Nothing bundt cakes: too much white decor on top of every cake

Marvel cake: their choc simply tastes weird, even the croissant sadly has a very weird taste, it feels like hazelnut idk but this was disappointing. Also what they have is actually not cake slices at all, more like custom desserts resembling cakes to some extent

Alexanders Pat: no traditional choc cake slice, only choc mousse 


Any suggestions? Only option left is to order the whole large cake, cut a slice and throw away the rest since I cant eat it all that way. But I cannot imagine being so wasteful

\# Chapter 0.5 — Xueli: One Punch



\*One punch.\*



One punch and I could stop his crap.



Ironic, huh?



I laughed—a dry, small thing that sounded like a broken radio.



I can’t decide whether I’ll let him live and strut away in the smoke or end it for him before he could kill me.



I know my answer.



\# Chapter 1 — Xueli: Flares and Fumes



Rain hit my neck like missiles, fast, heavy, and \*loud\*.



Kaian stood in the middle of the streetlight’s flicker, grin sharp enough to cut glass. His daggers spun lazily between his fingers, catching the neon glow. 



Behind me, Kaevai’s water shimmered into shape — cold blue arcs curling around his hands like serpents waiting to strike.



Me? I wiped the blood running down my cheek away and sucked my teeth—



This was going to be fun.



“You know,” I sighed, rubbing the side of my blade like it was a wine glass, “I’d almost feel bad for you if you didn’t look like a walking warcrime.”



\*Lie, this boy is gorgeous.\*



\*Also lie, I’d never feel bad for such a pig.\*



Kaian tilted his head, smile never fading. “Aw, Xueli. You flirt like you fight. Messy.”



The wind shifted—and so did he.



A blur of blades, ice and rage. Two daggers.



I barely saw the first one until it nearly sliced where my neck was. I dropped low and put my hand up—



And \*fire\* answered my call.



He twisted through it. Like, literally turning in the air like smoke given a smirk.



Kaevai’s voice roared louder than the pouring rain, “Move!”



A wall of water shot in front of me just as I shot myself backwards, sword clattering somewhere.



I couldn’t see where it went if I wanted to keep my eyes on Kaian.



Kaian slammed into a wall, the impact boomed over the buzz of the streets and cracked concrete.



I groped for my blade, “Could’ve given me a second warning!”



Kaevai’s grin was all teeth, “You’re welcome.”



A deafening crack, and Kaevai’s wall had splashed in my face just as I grasped my sword.



“Above!” I screamed, a primal instinct willed my hand to shoot plumes of smoke and fire under Kaian’s foot as he jumped over me.



A dagger whistled past my right ear as I jerked away.



He landed behind me, foot hitting the puddle with a slap, and before I could pivot, the air exploded.



A chaos of blue and red sparks, deafening booms of wind, and whirlpools of water flew between us.



The smoke hazed my vision, tears blurring my sight as fire engulfed my sword, burning my hands as I shoved it towards Kaian.



Wind pressure shoved me back into Kaevai, and for a second, it was all reflex and chaos.



Hands pushed me up, and Kaevai jumped beside me, his Amp snapping to life, water coursing around his knuckles like snakes.



“You guys make \*such\* a cute disaster,” Kaian snarls, voice sing-song and insane, “Perhaps I’ll bury you together!”



I spat blood and rainwater, “Cute this, loser!”



Fire hugged my blade. Kaevai’s Amp rose, a vortex of water wrapping around him.



The alley groaned under the pressure of everything.



Heat.



Cold.



Water.



Fire.



Wind.



And I \*knew\* that when the light hit Kaian’s smile the way it is now—



It was going to get ugly.



And someone was going to bleed.



I shoved my sword towards him \*like I meant it\*.



Not those cute half-tries I do when I’m playing as \*charming\* Xueli.



My blade turned blue with flame.



Rainwater made the fire flicker with hesitation, and for a second the world gave us a perfect frame.



Fire and air. He and I.



My blade met his dagger in a spar of heat and wind. 



Metal screamed. 



I tasted smoke and iron on the roof of my mouth—



And something sweet under it—adrenaline, or maybe the stupid thrill that makes you forget you’re allowed to be afraid.



Kaevai’s vortex tried to swallow us, water shearing my jacket. He looked at me like he was going to grin. 



“Finish it, Lee,” he never calls me Lee unless he’s bored or serious.



This time it’s \*serious\*.



I flipped his dagger down, and for a split-second I saw a thread of worry—something human in the plasticity of this fight.



And that thread was something I liked to cut for fun.



My sword flew under his guard and bit into the flesh of his ribs.



A gasp. Not dramatic, but more of a sharp inhale.



He didn’t drop. Of course not, Kaian \*never\* does the polite thing.



Instead, he laughs, full of glass shards and jagged edges.



The tension didn’t just \*shift\*. It moved.



It bit into Kaevai’s water, turning a heavy force into a feeble splash.



He breathed sharply, as if it hurt to exist.



Kaevai gripped his Amp; fire wrapped around my hands.



We were ready.



Kaian staggered, hand clamped on the cut.



And for one \*stupid\* second, he looked small.



Victory tasted like smoke. Bitter and leathery.



I wanted to press it. I wanted to stomp on his pride and rip the blades from his hands.



I wanted to see him fall in a dramatic way, so I could strut out like I rehearsed hatred in a mirror.



Yet he smiled like it hurt, and blood dripped down his cheek as he lifted a hand and let out a rain of blades.



I moved because, well, I moved. No thoughts. Just action.



One dove for Kaevai’s head. One for my wrist. and one to the neon sign just living its best life on the corner of a store. Each blade a razor of compressed air flying in a halo of fear.



And Kaian used the second wind to vanish.



\# Chapter 2 — Kaevai: Neon Hangover



The morning didn’t rise as much as it stumbled in.



And then it broke the coffee pot.



Okay, \*that\* was Xueli, but still.



When the rain died, so did the fight—but the aching in my bones didn’t.



I was already up, sitting on the fire exit, sipping a latte that smelled better than what happened yesterday, I can say for sure.



Xueli opened the window like she was haunted. Eye bags, messy hair, the works.



She was still cute, though.



“You’re up early,” she yawned, reaching for my cup.



I didn’t look over; I already knew what she was doing.



“You snore,” I said, fighting a smile—it’s too early for smiles.



“I almost \*died\*, Kae.”



I flinch. Didn’t need \*that\* reminder, Lee.



“And yet, the snore survived,” I sighed, rubbing a hand over my face.



Below us, the hum of the city seemed to hold its breath with us.



Hoping that was the end of Kaian, at least for now.



Xueli grabbed my steaming cup and took a sip, “You think he’s still out there? Licking his wounds?”



This time I turn to her, tired and weary, “If I know Kaian, he’s probably out there right now flirting with a nurse about how we broke his heart—and his ribs.”



She snorted, “Sounds accurate.”



I could imagine him sharing stories with his roommates, the details changing every time.



“Also,” I started, “You owe me a new Amp.”



“You broke it.”



“You screamed ‘move,’ I moved, and your fire melted half my tech.”



She pointed at me with \*my\* mug. “You’re welcome for saving your pretty face.”



I smirked. “You’re assuming that was the target.”



We sat there in pure silence, the kind only trauma-bonded people can sit in. Everything that hadn’t been said was floating there with soot and leftover adrenaline.



“You ever think that, maybe, we’re just going through the motions?” I ask, shoulders drooping.



Xueli sighed, took a sip, and replied, “Maybe.”



“School starts in an hour,” I groan.



We could’ve almost died last night—



Yet, in the morning, we’d have to lie about our scars.



Pretend we hung out like normal—



\*and\* go to school that day like nothing happened.



\# Chapter 3 — Kaian: Pretty People Bleed Better



Pain’s got rhythm, you get me? It’s like Satan’s drumset.



Every throb from my ribs? Satan’s sticks on my chest.



Every sigh from the nurses? Cymbals.



Every minute I survive? Standing ovation.



Yep, still alive. Sorry, Xueli and Kaevai.



“Don’t move—you’re lucky to be alive,” Nurse #3 mutters.



Am I really, though?



“Breathing’s \*lame\*. Try bleeding, really makes you grow.”



She glares, which I take as a look of adoration.



Some people flirt with words.



I flirt with Death. Then I give it a kiss goodnight and come back up to Earth.



The mirror shows me what Xueli \*didn’t\* melt off.



My face came out in better shape than I expected, seeing how I fought fire with literal oxygen.



Scar on my lip. Stitched up jaw. Bruised cheek.



Still hot though.



“Next time \*don’t\* piss off your enemies,” Nurse #2 muttered under her breath.



“No, no, dear,” I grin at my butchered face, “They were \*thrilled\*.”



She leaves. Great job, girlie.



My Amp’s dead. Daggers hidden somewhere with my glasses and pride.



The buzz of people following the motions is the perfect background music for me to think in.



Unfortunately, I don’t like thinking.



It never ends well.



Because whenever I close my eyes, I see \*them\*.



Fire-girl with eyes like matches.

Voice like a dare.

Smile like she’s already won.



Xueli.



And then there’s Kaevai. The wannabe saint with hydro tricks and hero guilt. Always trying to save people who never asked for it.



Cute.

 

I run my finger around the rim of my mug, “You two still alive? Good, that keeps me outside, and keeps the chaos out of the city.”



Because they have no idea what their role is.



I reach for the comm tag I hid under my stiff pillow and flick it on, the static buzzes like my ears did when I woke up.



“You failed,” A cold, almost-mechanical voice states, “You had orders to kill.”



I chuckle, low and broken. “I had fun. That counts, right?”



“You weren’t meant to \*play\* with them.”



“Even a child plays with their food before they eat it,” I scoff under my breath.



“What?” Sharp and deadly.



“I never play. I live to serve under your rule,” I lie.



A spark under the skin of my fingertips begs to be unleashed. Wind gathers, restless, waiting to see if I’ll lead them or let them overpower me.



The air in the room trembles, as if it’s waiting for me to decide.



Engulf the world in my air?



Or let it beat the life out of me.



“I’ll finish it,” I mutter to the comm, a smirk curling the sides of my mouth even through blood-stained teeth, “After all…”



I stand up from my bed and drop the comm tab.



Lift my foot.



“Pretty people bleed better.”



And drop it. 



Letting the shards scatter like leaves in front of a leafblower.



\# Chapter 4 — Xueli: School Waits For No One



Clothes. Bag. Shoes. 



Ready.



Kae’s still doing his hair, and we \*still\* haven’t made breakfast.



So I guess we aren’t necessarily \*ready\*, but I am.



Ready to face noisy kids, dim lights, and snarky teachers.



Fun.



“Ready!” Kaevai chirps, two granola bars in hand and a smile plastered on his face.



“Great, because the bus is at the stop sign, give it a bit.”



The bus ride was a blur of Kaevai talking about his Amp \*way too loudly\* for something that’s banned in our state, and bad high-school flirting.



Finally, we’re at homeroom on time. A first for everything, I guess.



I plop onto the chair behind my desk, watching Kae do the same beside me.



The teacher comes in with a boy I don’t recognize at first.



“Class, this is Kaian Blackwood. He’s transferring in from—well, somewhere else. Please make him feel welcome—and, er, Kaian? Try not to break anything.”



Oh, of course. Just my luck.



Hair wet, face smug, lips split from our \*hangout\* last night.



He leans against the wall. Casual. Deadly. 



\*Infuriating.\*



“Morning, everyone,” he says. Voice smooth, like he owns the apocalypse.



I tilt my head to get a good look at Kae, who raises his hand ever so slightly in a wave. 



“Welcome, Satan,” he mutters under his breath.



I look back at Kaian, his eyes burning a hole into my skull, and I could feel my paper pulling in his direction.



“Hey, Xueli,” he said, his voice low and smile wider than ever.



I slowly raise my hand and match his grin, “Hi, Kaian. Welcome.”



He slides into the free desk beside me.



And that’s when I realize that he isn’t going to make this easy for me.



\# Chapter 5 — Kaevai: I Make Good With The Asshole Of The Year



“Welcome, Satan.”



And I mean it—I do really want to see what he does when we’re not alone.



Does he still flirt with us like it’s autonomous?



He sits beside Xueli, sandwiching her between us.



“So, Kaevai,” Kaian starts, his stupid smirk never falling, “Is all of your school as ghetto as your classmates, or what?”



\*No, it’s just you.\*



I reply curtly, “It matters what your definition of \*ghetto\* is.”



Kaian pouts and looks past Xueli to me, “Aw, don’t be like that!”



“Like \*what\*?” I ask, harsher than I expected.



I shut my eyes, grounding myself.



The desk was cold under my hands, steeling me for his \*stupid\* face when I opened my eyes again.



“Your face does the thing,” Kaian says, staring at me—\*no\*—analyzing me.



I sigh, “Elaborate, please.”



His eyes flicker for just a second. They don’t dim—



They turn off. Like someone flicked a light switch at just the wrong moment.



“It turns to… concrete. Like you’re waiting for the second shoe to drop.”



“I can switch with one of you guys, if you want,” Xueli said.



“Did you just… psycho-analyze me?” I scoffed, brow furrowed in confusion.



\*Why is Kaian of all people staring into my soul?\*



“Maybe,” he said, shifting closer.



His gaze made my stomach churn and twist like beef through a grinder.



\*Maybe\*.



“Guys, like, I really don’t mind,” Xueli says. \*Again.\*



I meet his stare with my own—no way I’m letting this guy stare me into oblivion.



His eyes flicker for just a second behind me.



\*At the walls\*.



\# Chapter 6 — Kaian: Watch The World Burn, Then Douse It In Your Tears



\*Why are the walls moving?\*



Walls \*do not\* move.



Because—you know—they’re \*walls\*.



\*I\* was supposed to press the air.



\*So, why is it pressing and popping my lungs?\*



And why—\*why the fuck do my legs feel like lead?\*



A laugh.



Hallow. Strangled.



\*Sharp.\*



My throat clenches like my stomach does when—



\*When I fail.\*



No—



Not here.



Not now.



Not in front of—



\*Them.\*



\*Eyes like matches.\*



\*Voice like a stream of water—gushing, pouring into a ditch that can’t hold it all.\*



And the air—



\*Syrupy-thick, like running your hand through a pool.\*



I slammed a heavy hand on the cold, steady desk.



\*One.\*



\*Two.\*



\*Three whole times.\*



“Kaian—“ Kaevai starts—\*that\* \*fucking voice\*.



“Yo, Xueli, imagine how awesome you’d be if you had—“ I raise the hand I just slammed on the desk, voice cracking, “Wait for it… \*A personality.\*”



Quiet.



No comeback.



No noise.



“Why can’t I \*stop thinking\*?” I gasp, voice cracking. The neon flicker of my phone mocked me.



Daring me to say something else.



\*Say something funny.\*



\*Say something to get yourself out of here.\*



 Every flash of light was a reminder that someone, \*anyone\*, could see me like this.



That they already \*were\*.



“Can I go to the bathroom?” I ask, vision shivering over the edges.



The teacher raised a finger, “\*May\* you.” 



“\*May I\*.”



“Yes.”



\*I may.\*



I stumble out of the classroom, and the last thing I hear before shutting the door is—



“May I go, too?”



\*No, Kaevai—\*



You may \*not\*.



I let my feet take me down the hallway, coincidentally finding a bathroom.



I crumple into myself, heart hammering out of my chest, begging to show itself to someone—\*anyone\*—who’d give me a second glance.



My lungs stutter for just a second



A voice.



“Hello?”





\# Chapter 7: Diego — Hero Complex in The Men’s Room—A Guide On How To Be Awkwardly Helpful



I leave my class and step into the Men’s Room ready to take the \*largest shit ever\*.



As I close the door, I’ve finished drafting the formal apology that I’ll probably have to send to my kind classmates who don’t deserve the smell.



\*Sobs.\* Not mine, obviously.



I frown, “Hello?”



I hear the same words. Over and over again.



“I failed.”



“Failed \*what?\*” I blurt, the air doesn’t move around us, yet my throat feels like it’s about to swallow the words right back in.



“A job,” he answers, voice like gravel.



“What job?” I ask before realizing it’s probably personal as fuck to just ask that, “Er—if you \*want to\* tell me.”



He uses the sink to lift himself and look at me, “Maybe—\*maybe\*—it’s not necessarily \*legal\*.”



“I—how can something be not \*necessarily legal\*?” I ask, furrowing my brow.



“Fine. It’s not. It’s straight up \*illegal\*. But,” he sighs, running a hand down his face, “\*I don’t have a choice.\*”



I look right at him this time, “\*Everyone\* has a choice.”



My mom had a choice to leave me. She did. 



My dad had a choice to leave me. He didn’t.



But as I watch his face fall, the knot in my stomach tightens even more.



And when that tear fell, my heart jumped up in my throat.



I sigh and reach out my hand, “I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”



He opened his mouth as if he were going to say something profound, but then he closed it.



I \*still\* didn’t know this guy’s name, but I was going to stick with him until he was okay. 



I step closer to him, hand still out.



Finally, he takes it, and we walk out like the most constipated pair ever—



Or, that might’ve just been me.



\# Chapter 8 — Kaevai: Small World, Big Coincidences



I slip past classes and glance around.



Like a normal person.



Not looking for anyone, obviously. 



Definitely not a dude named Kaian.



Why would I look for someone who’s cocky, smart, and infuriating?



Oh, and he almost killed us.



See? Why would I look for a dude like that?



I asked to go to the bathroom and shut the door behind me.



My basketball shoes squeak against the cold tile of the school hallways as I slip in and out of bathrooms, the whiff of smoke making me nearly sprint out of the last one.



There were only two bathrooms left in the school, which I hadn’t checked.



I stepped into the bathroom right in front of the labs. As I walked in, a darker-skinned kid and a fairer-skinned dude with really wet hair and smudged eyeliner passed me, holding hands.



I hadn’t heard about them yet.



\*Are they in our grade?\*



\*Do people know about them?\*



I shrug off the questions and pretend to wash my hands so I don’t look conspicuous.



Then I hear a laugh.



It \*sounds\* like Kaian’s, but warped.



Usually, he laughs like he walks.



\*Cold.\*



\*Calculated.\*



But, this one sounds \*happy.\*



Like it has company.



More than just one laugh.



I take strides as I rub my drenched hands on my pants.



I call, “Kaian!”



I’m only a few feet behind them, but amidst the chatter and sounds of the school, I could really be yelling from the opposite side of the hallway, and what they heard wouldn’t be any different.



“Kaian!” I call. \*Again.\*



This time, he turns around, a flash of confusion on his face.



I sigh, and my stomach churns as I glance at the clock.



\*8:16 am.\*



I’ve been—seemingly—in the bathroom for \*forty-six minutes.\*



This time, my patience had been depleted even worse than my Spanish grades.



“Oh my god, \*Kaian,\*” I yelled, watching his head snap to my direction.



His face fell for a second as he focused on me, trying to see who I was from afar.



“Oh,” he said, glancing at the dude still holding his hand, then at me, “Hey, Kaevai. Wanna walk with us?”



He said the last part flatly, as if he didn’t care. Shoulder slumped. He looked like he was on the brink of a shrug.



But his eyes betrayed him; they looked at his friend expectantly, as if he only wanted to do what that dude wanted to.



It made me want to smile.



\*Looks like Mr. I-Have-Daggers-And-Jokes has a soft spot for good-looking-dudes.\*



Kaian’s friend grinned and gave me his hand to shake, “I’m Diego. And seems like you’re the dude Kaian was talking about. Come join us for a series of skipping class and debating whether hot dogs are tacos or sandwiches.”



I took it with a snicker and walked with my enemy and his new \*friend.\*



\# Chapter 9 — Xueli: Waiting



I’m sitting in my next class, staring at the door like it just roasted my whole bloodline.



The teacher is talking about oxymorons, but at this point, I should be up there teaching that lesson, seeing how my life is basically just a big contradiction.



“Xueli, if you have three fish, four refrigerators, and seventeen pancakes, how long will it take to fly to Rome?”



My head snaps up to see the teacher look at me from over her glasses, and everyone around me freezes to hear my answer.



“Sell the fish for thirty bucks altogether…” I mutter to myself before watching the class burst into laughter.



My face burns brighter than my sword did last night, and I’m having trouble closing my mouth.



“I’m sorry, Xueli, but I’ve been waiting to do that one for \*weeks\*, now,” my teacher sniggers under her hand.



\*Just a joke.\*



Doesn’t make it any more embarrassing, though.



Despite all that, I can’t help but feel a smile poke through the blush.



The teacher blew out a breath, “Glad to know you aren’t planning my death by burning at the stake,” she smiled before turning back to the smartboard.



The words still blur together, though. 



Somehow, I survived blood, rain, and daggers—



But I almost died from cringe.



Then—



\*Crash.\*



Alarms blaring.



\*At least this way, I won’t die of absolute embarrassment.\*



\# Chapter 10 — Kaian: Alarms and First Dates



I’m debating with Diego and Kaevai if we should just leave school at this point.



“If we’re skipping anyway, why can’t we just go to a club or something?” I groan, rubbing my hands down my face.



I longingly watch the cars from the window of the front doors.



Diego gapes at me like I’ve grown an extra head while I’ve been talking, “One, I \*hate\* alcohol. Two, we don’t even have fakes.”



“I do,” Kaevai mutters under his breath, before looking at us incredulously.



This time, I’m fighting the parental urge, “You have \*what?\*”



He shrugged and looked at me, “Needed it at the time for…”



I nod.



\*Thank God I crushed that comm.\*



Diego looks between us, brows furrowed in confusion, “You guys \*definitely\* have history.”



Kaevai raises his brow, and I could read his thoughts from miles away.



\*Your funeral, man.\*



“Remember that \*not-legal\* job I have?” I ask Diego, who nods, fingers clasping at his chain.



“Yes?” Diego says, before glancing at Kaevai and back to me, “What, if you sell drugs, I don’t care that much.”



“\*Much\* more illegal than drugs,” Kaevai mutters for only us to hear.



“Look, Diego,” I say, steeling myself for him to yell.



The more pragmatic side of me whispers—yeah, it \*does\* exist—\*He’s going to tell everyone.\* 



But as I keep my eyes shut, I tell him anyway, “I work—no, \*worked\*—for a company that has… Opinions.”



“And those opinions are?” Diego asks, his eyes brightening with curiosity.



“Look, ever read a light novel?” I ask, hoping the answer’s yes, because those books are \*super\* cool.



He just nods.



Kaevai stands there, watching the scene like a cat watches from a window.



“I’m like a Hyperion Guard from Destiny Awaits Those With Wraithe.”



Diego gapes again for a second.



\*Two seconds.\*



“\*That’s\* where I know you from!”



“What?” Kaevai snaps, before covering his mouth while mouthing an apology.



“I’ve seen you on my walks. Not very discreet,” Diego smiles.



Kaevai holds up both his hands, “\*Okay,\*” he says, “Plot twist of the century—”



But what he says next is drowned out by the violent crash in front of us.



Diego falls on me, and we tumble to the floor.



Throughout the chaos, I keep my eyes on Kaevai, whose eyes are darting from hallway to hallway.



His mouth is still moving at a hundred miles per hour, but I can’t make out what he’s saying.



Diego looks up at me, his head still on my lap, “We need to follow him, he’s looking for—”



I can’t read the rest of what he’s saying because I can’t piece together the syllables.



\*You leave?\*



\*Xueli.\*



I stand up, dragging Diego with me.



I could’ve sat there for years, but I can’t be like how I used to be.



I have to save Xueli and Kaevai; I can’t keep on inflicting harm on people.



\*The Hyperion Guard Kaian has died.\*



But the guy grabbing my hand right now?



He kinda makes me wanna live.



\# Chapter 11 — Diego: Hide And Seek, You’re Dead



When those two armoured people literally \*ran through\* the glass doors in the front foyer, my knees gave out from impact.



Glass shards rained over us like rain, and as I dodged them, I pushed Kaian to the ground.



He was splayed under me, but under the deafening alarms, I knew he wouldn’t hear me if I apologized.



His eyes were locked onto Kaevai, who looked like a trapped mouse, glancing everywhere, looking for a way out.



Then it clicks.



\*Xueli.\*



I don’t know much about her, since we’re in different friend groups, but she’s Kaevai’s ride-or-die, and I can see that he’s gearing up for the \*die\* part.



I look up to Kaian and scream to him, “We need to follow him, he’s looking for Xueli!”



He looks down at my lips, his nose scrunched from concentration.



\*Adorable.\* Even if he’s a killer.



I stand up, feeling my skin tear, the shards digging into my arms.



Kaian shoots up, grabbing my bloody hands as we sprint away from the Guards and to the alarms.



Kaevai’s screams are drowned out by all the chaos happening around us, but I can make an educated guess on what he’s saying.



He’s standing in the middle of a crowd, pushing through the stream like a salmon in a freshwater river.



I spot a girl wearing baggy jeans and a bun messier than the situation we’re in.



Yep, Xueli, alright.



She’s also watching around her, obviously looking for Kaevai, who probably seems like \*he’s\* the lost one.



Then, Kaevai’s face lit up, and he pushed between the lines of terrified kids to reach Xueli.



They scream in each other’s ears for a few seconds as Kaian and I—the former still gripping my hand—push our own way to them.



Wordlessly, we funnel ourselves with the rest of the school, praying we’re not the target of this raid.



Ok, Kaian was a little less quiet, as he kept making stupid jokes.



The alarms and sirens overpowered his voice, but I couldn’t help but read his lips anyway.



My hair kept falling in my face, locks blinding me.



\*Dramatic, I know.\*



As we mindlessly walked with the crowd like the sheep we were, the crowd abruptly stopped.



Once the sirens died down, the conversations did too. My ears buzzed, adjusting to the quiet.



That was, until the first cry of fear, which matched how I felt the whole long walk.



Screams echoed across the streets, and from only meters in front of us, a gut-wrenching squelch made me retch.



Kaian put his hand on my back, “Are you okay?”



I nod, swallowing the bile that threatened to come up.



Bitter and disgusting—yet, weirdly enough, not the worst part of the day.



That’s yet to come.



\# Chapter 12 — Kaevai: Amplified Fires



My hands were already trembling at the thought of what had happened in the foyer.



When that scream rang out? Yeah, I was done.



The rational part of my brain told me, \*You fixed the Amp. You can take these motherfuckers.\*



Did I believe it? Still up for jury.



Then, a flash of light and heat slashed right through the clutter of people in front of us.



I sucked in a breath, chemicals floating its way to the back of my throat, as a handful of kids—all, oddly enough, with glasses—fell to the ground, fire crawling up their bodies faster than my heart jumped out of my chest.



Without thinking, I shoved a hand towards them, splaying layers of water on their burned bodies.



Pink flesh and skin flowered with soot crawled from in front of us. Their sobs made passersbys glance and run once they catch a glimpse of the scene. 



I look at the kids.



At the Guards.



And for a split second—just one—I want to burn the Guards back.



Not a lot. Just enough for them to taste the pain.



But I never change the setting.



Instead, I let Xueli do the burning.



Last time we were here, it was us against Kaian.



Now, it’s him \*with\* us.



Without looking, I know the plan.



But I’m getting tired of water.



In seconds, the soft blues that tinted the Amp change to a cloudy grey.



No one watches me in fights. That used to \*wreck\* me.



But honestly? Being sneaky is kind of a buff.



Kaian’s pushing Diego away, hissing about it not being safe.



Then another flash of fire rings right in front of us.



Sneaky isn’t going to get me \*shit\* today.



Xueli looks like she has gears inside of her; she’s getting winded up to jump on one of the Guards.



I flick out a hand and watch as a metal-clad Guard floats up to the skies, screaming, “Get me down!” Like a forgotten balloon.



His voice cracks so hard I almost feel bad.



\*Almost.\*



Xueli jumps on the other Guard, fire wrapping around her sword.



Kaian shoots daggers as I switch my Amp, softening the greys into whites, like snow.



Cold.



Hard.



Biting.



I push Kaian’s daggers with the wind. Diego’s ransacking his hoodie pockets for something.



He pulls out an Amp.



\*How’d he get that?\*



I glance at Kaian and see him asking the same question.



I try to change back to water, but it doesn’t work.



Instead, I flick a hand towards the Guard and watch as—



A soft breeze fluttered a girl’s bands.



Dramatically, though.



\*Not now.\*



I don’t believe in God, but there I was, praying to every god and goddess controlling this neon hellscape.



All our efforts are futile, and we’re getting tired.



Then, a flash of light blinds us.



Honey crawls between us and the Guard, trapping her.



\*Solid light.\*



She’s in the middle of a scream, like a photo she wasn’t ready for.



I turn to Diego, who also looks frozen, but in a more \*Holy shit, what did I just do?\* way.



I stare at the crowd.



\*So many cameras.\*



But Xueli says it before I even open my mouth, “We’ve got to go!”



She says it quietly, but the urgency is in the air.



We sprint out of the circle formed by the crowd, wondering what’s going to happen next.



One thing I know for sure?



We aren’t done.



Not even close.

[Too High](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/too-high)

You don’t know where Jared got that weed, but it was crazy potent and everyone is too high. And it was laced with something because you’re all hallucinating that you’re video game characters, with powers and everything. You have the munchies and it is time to go to Taco Bell! 

What I Like About This One:

This is  the first game I’ve made for this challenge where I asked someone else ‘Hey, what game do you think I should make?’ My dear friend Lindsey suggested this. 

I live in Canada where marijuana is legal and healthcare is free. You don’t need a weed spot - there are two dozen places withing walking distance of my house where I could pick up quality ganja. I don’t actually smoke, myself, but it’s nice to know that I never have to worry about this happening if I do. 

The idea of ‘death’ being that you just sober up is legitimately hilarious to me. 

What I’d Do Differently Next Time: 

This one is maybe a little basic for one of my games. I’d probably look at a resource management track that’s a bit more interesting overall. Maybe a couple of different levers to balance.

I have tested on a task management app.
I tested on coffee shops and hot sauces.
I ran it to design a non fiction book.
I’ve seen candy shops to mobile grooming.

When I read the branding reports it outputs they started to have a pattern, a good one. I was surprised when the branding documents were written in the style of each of the businesses they were profiling. 

It may seem obvious but I read too much design jargon and ‘thought leadership’ that I wanted something that didn’t act like that.

I had gotten accepted to the university with a 4.66 GPA from high school and 19 college credits from my AP exams that I had passed in high school prior. I had also gotten in with a presidential scholarship (not full ride). Originally I came in as an aerospace engineering major into the Clark School of Engineering, however, I changed my field of study to finance shortly after I had gotten accepted and they let me switch no problem. Freshman year comes and I am doing pretty well in my classes up until second semester where I am starting to care more about the social scene, rather than my own academics. I also ended up failing a class my spring semester. At the same time, I was also working at a local bar down from where I lived at and continued until sophomore year. Throughout college, I had a bunch of different jobs and was probably working more than I was attending my own classes. I also was not applying for internships, had gotten kicked out of my fraternity, was drinking a lot (and I mean A LOT), smoking weed almost everyday until around senior year, and did not care about college too much. I never secured an internship, realized University of Maryland isn't even a target school regardless, never really had mock interviews or coffee chats, and never even ended up with any sort of help related to my field once I graduated.

Fast forward to now and I am out of school now for half a year without employment. I had to ditch a job because I realized it seemed more like an MLM and was basically just selling insurance the entire time disguised as a ""financial advisor"". I am now starting to regret not going the aerospace engineering or engineering route in general and now am lost. I never realized finance was super competitive. All I can say for people going into college/university or currently enrolled, seriously consider and research the type of field you are in.

Drip coffee, Keurig drinker my whole life. Got the capresso ecpro out of the basement after 10 years and started making coffee. Liked it a bit. Got a df54 grinder, liked it a bit more. Ecpro sucks, so either BBP or Legato. 

Im liking a double shot cut by a little water, a “mini americano” as I don’t if it has a name. 
liking the process and ritual, dialing in, workflow, etc. 
get a cappuccino in Starbucks usually. 

wife wants easy, loves her Keurig, would like auto steamer, bambino she might use, never the Legato. 

ive done pro and cons now for 14 months it seems. 

BBP - Appliance like, auto steaming, quick warm up but inconsistent shots, low temp so no light roasts

Legato - Boiler + thermoblock, adjustable pid (sort of), 58mm, OPV, boxy looking, no hot water

#Part One Summary 

**Cedar Sage Stranger**

Cedar, who is now living in a sharehouse with Izzy, Ziggy and Wynn, receives news that Phoenix is getting out of prison.  They often have house meetings where they sit in a circle and talk.  Despite trying online during lockdowns, Cedar doesn't have a partner and isn't even sure of her sexuality.  Ziggy is her best friend but Cedar has never been able to tell her that it was her sister Phoenix who brutally raped Ziggy's friend years ago.  Cedar messages her mother to check if she knows about Phoenix’s release.  While confiding in Izzy about her anxieties about telling Ziggy about Phoenix, Ziggy walks in and Cedar confesses that Phoenix is her sister.

**Jake Traverse**

The news of Phoenix's release makes Jake twitchy.  He is the shift supervisor at a youth drop-in centre, and discusses his fears with Dakota, a co-worker. He enjoys his work, but doesn't aspire to do the study required for a Social Work degree.  He used to be like a lot of the kids at the Centre, thinking that everyone was out to get him.  His mother Lou calls him to ask him to babysit his younger brother Gabey - he can tell from her chirpiness that she has a new man, which annoys him.  He recalls the night when his buddy Dug was stabbed.  They were in a gang at the time, partying and dealing.  When he arrived home the next morning, Lou looked concerned, and sent him off to Moshoom’s.  He stayed a year, working with Moshoom, who taught him the old ways of talking and listening, learning some life lessons.  He stayed out of trouble afterwards, but kept his knife.

**M Traverse**

M is writing a graphic novel, for which the publisher has already advanced her the money, after much success with her previous ones.  This began as part of her therapy for PTSD, as a way to process the aftermath of her assault.  She had come out as asexual last year to Paul, Pete and Jake.  Her mother appeared to have the view that it's a temporary thing, and like her therapist, viewed it as a response to trauma.  M disagreed.  Jake, who is M’s favourite, drops in to tell her about Phoenix.  He has always understood her and looked after her.  

**Ben**


Ben, Phoenix's old counsellor, is having a skunk war, hating that he has to kill them. After spending the first half of his life causing trouble, the second life was spent talking to others who had caused trouble, wanting to help them and share the Teachings he was given.  He chats at the store with Cheryl, Emily's grandmother, who used to be an artist but now lives in the bush trying to get away from it all. People find it easy to talk to Ben because he listens; he likes people and that's why they trust him.  Cheryl tells him that her granddaughter’s attacker is getting out of prison, but Ben doesn’t admit that he knew Phoenix.  He isn’t surprised that she has hurt someone in his circle; after all the good he has tried to do with helping people, he feels he has achieved nothing.  He used to run Circles, referred to as Restorative Justice, which were successful for some, but others, usually the disempowered, left just as hurt.  However he always saw hope in everyone, and continued to try.  He understood Phoenix, at the same time understanding why people hated her.

**Alexandra**

Alexandra is ‘Ship’s 10 year old daughter.  She knows that Ship/Bishop, the uncle of Phoenix, is angry because Phoenix came around to the house, and she shouldn't have let her in.  She eavesdrops on conversations between Ship and Uncle Kyle to try to figure out what it's all about. 

**Elsie Stranger**

Elsie is waiting at a coffee shop for Phoenix who is late.  Elsie lives in the country with Waaban, her teacher and friend, who has taught her techniques for managing her thoughts.  She feels shame and that she deserves being stood up, she thinks she continues to be a waste of space mother.  

**Larry**

Larry, a journalist, spots Elsie walk past while he’s sitting outside the pub.  He notices her typical Stranger walk, but thinks she looks a bit better.  He likes to wax nostalgic about the nineties, the golden age of gangs, when he would write articles about them.  He believes that past wrongs of colonialism and racism, which reduced economic choices, led to people finding gangs as a viable way of life.  He is trying to write a story, but is uncomfortable about writing Native stories, as a Non-Native, and would like to hand the book over to someone else.  He likes to listen in on the police radio, and hears a call go out for a Miss Phoenix Anne Stranger, recently released but didn’t report.  He quietly wishes Elsie and Phoenix well.

Also Venting/Life Story lol,"For some reason recently I am feeling avoidant to wanting to take my meds. I haven’t taken my Wellbutrin in like a week or two even though I’ve been on it for months. And my Adderall either, my sleep schedule is also really bad lately like I do want to go to sleep/can’t stay asleep. (Another reason I’m not taking it I guess?) I have been drinking coffee lately again though. Note I did just take my meds today but I just feel anxious/anxiety right now after a few hours probably cause I have to readjust again? I have had this random feeling of not wanting to take meds multiple times before. Like feeling avoidant/aversive to it lol.

Like I’m not sure why but I just don’t want to for some reason. Life is in an extreme stressfully weird place recently as I have a potential job lined up but I have to move for it. I’m still saving up to move and I’m just not sure where I’m at with everything. Like I’m waiting for a letter of recommendation to be sent to new job. I need to save to move and find a roommate somehow but I’m also like broke lol. I’m working but it’s pretty slow & I wish my paycheck were more but it was already hard to get this job where I am. Atleast I even have a job right now. But I just found out at work the owner sold it to someone else so we’re all like wtf since they didn’t tell us anything. 

I think I might talk to my psych again, I didn’t mention I stopped taking stuff but I was also thinking well if I move I won’t have access to meds again anyways for awhile since I won’t have insurance. I stopped taking my Xanax like weeks ago because I feel like it was giving me rebound panic attacks potentially & making me dependent. She wants to try to add Abilify. Idk I just feel almost very flat/nothing but maybe cause I’m not taking meds and my life just feels really scrambled lately. I am a little sad because someone important cut me off like a month ago+ but also I understand at the same time and made peace with it I guess? Maybe I’m getting more depressed since it also gets dark way too early? I’m taking vitamin D weekly just in case. 

I’m worried a bit since last med I (unknowingly) was having paranoia until I realized it. It made me think because in the past on some combo of meds I did have paranoia/more anxiety but I wasn’t aware of it being amplified. I feel like my emotions keep controlling me. I’m kind of tired of it. I don’t feel like it’s bipolar/up and down but I feel like stuff just affects me & maybe even subconsciously it just does. I have hope that things in life will improve like barely though lol. I don’t have any support and I’m tired of trying to solve everything lol. I just want things to be fixed and able to actually relax. Like finances are a huge stressor for me. ",1,1764207327.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,1.0,False

1p7pjsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p7pjsg/stuck_in_a_halfrelationship_with_a_someone_i/,Stuck in a “half-relationship” with a someone I deeply care about,"TL;DR: Master’s students in Italy. For months we’ve had an “almost relationship”: deep emotional intimacy, 1–1 nights at her place, pet names, strong eye contact, but no kiss/clear romantic move. I’m in love; she’s warm but keeps it undefined and says things like “I live in the present” and “I have a lot of patience”. I’m reducing intensity and keeping boundaries, but I’m torn between: (A) she’s slow-burn / stressed and could eventually want more, vs (B) she just likes having me as a almost-boyfriend with no commitment. Plan: wait through exam period, then have a calm talk to ask directly which of these it is. Looking for advice if this plan is sane and how to keep my boundaries until then.

The long story...

Me: 24M, doing a Master’s in Italy 
Her: 21F,  doing a Master’s in Italy
We are both from the same county and met through people from a shared friend group here.

At first I wasn’t super attracted to her looks, but as we talked more I developed a very strong emotional connection. Now I’m honestly half in love with her and really struggling with the “grey zone” we’re in.

We started hanging out a lot on campus (3–4 times a week), usually lunch or coffee.

She invited me over to her place twice at night:

Night 1: “Come over for Monopoly”:  we never played, just sat on the couch side by side and talked for hours about relationships, sex, past experiences, emotional stuff.

Night 2: I cooked for her at her place, again couch, again deep, open conversation.

She told me things like she doesn’t easily form deep bonds in relationships, she’s bad at reading “signs”, she’s under stress with studies, she wants to “live in the now and not overthink the future”.

I also opened up emotionally a lot (not as a strategy, it just happened) which is not usual for me. From then on my feelings really escalated.

There have been many moments that feel like we’re a couple, without any label:

Always sitting next to each other on the couch, not opposite or while together in public when someone approach to talk to us, she automatically takes a very couple-like position next to me while standing and talking to the other person.

She’s comfortable asking me to help with intimate house stuff like making her bed,
hanging her laundry together (bras/underwear in plain sight, she’s not awkward about it), cooking for each other, sharing sweets she bakes “and keeps some for me”. She once invited me to sit in one of her classes “so I see what she goes through”.

We have light physical contact (I gently touch her arm/side and she always seems comfortable, sometimes we hug each other especially for goodbye with ""resting"" her head on my chest).

We talk about personal/family issues, stress, sex, exes, future, etc.

So basically: very emotionally close, very “homey” and intimate, but never a kiss, never explicitly romantic (a lot of sexual though) words, although there have been times that I felt we were close but something always keeps her from proceeding.

Key moment:

One night we were both tired, walking very close, almost touching hands all the time. There was a lot of romantic tension, I could feel it everywhere in me and I could tell from her stance she was feeling something similar. In a square, she looked at me with this very intense, emotional look like she was ready to cry and said:

Be patient and everything will be fine.

I told her I trust her. She was not face to face with me, because obviously she was emotionally unstable that night, so she turned her back and walked away to the bus stop while I stood there still watching her going away.
The tension was so high I thought we were one breath away from something happening (kiss, or at least a clearer move). Nothing happened.

After that night, things shifted, after the tension she distanced herself, but her best friend visited, so she was very absorbed with her for 4-5 days.

Her stress about coursework and exams increased a lot (she tells me this openly). Her behavior became hot–cold, with fewer messages.

One time she replied the next day and another one she didn't even noticed the message until we accidentally met each other in the campus 2 days later. She avoids 1–1 night plans more often (mostly about dinners, but then again proposes to go to concerts together).

Example:

One time (at the beginning) we went out to eat just the two of us, it felt like a date and I paid.

Next time I suggested going out, she brought friends and everyone paid separately.

The third time she asked me to go out for dinner after I just came back from Switzerland. I thought we were getting somewhere with her proposing dinner. I arrived at her place to go together to the restaurant. She was well dressed and she was stunning but then she told me that she will have to go to a birthday party at 22:30 and that she's so sorry she didn't tell me that beforehand.

One time she said she doesn't have enough time to hang out at night, but then I see she went out with her friends. That hurt.

Meanwhile I fell really hard for her, sometimes I can’t properly sleep, my heart's racing, constantly overthinking her every move.

Recently: very “couple-like” behavior again

I had no hot water at my place. She basically said “why didn’t you tell me?” and suggested I come shower at hers.

That night:

She was relaxed and nicely dressed at home preparing to go to a birthday party, doing her makeup in front of me.

She cooked for me, asked me to make her bed, we hung her laundry together (again, lingerie in plain sight), we talked about Christmas decorations (once again having the same thoughts and taste), she talked about flowers she likes and her clothes size.

There was playful teasing (I joked “I’ll eat you together with the omelette” in a light, funny way — she laughed it off comfortably with a playful look).

On the metro goodbye:

She hugged me tightly, I whispered “thanks for tonight” and she made a soft, warm “awww” sound while""resting"" her head on my chest, she suggested we meet for lunch/coffee on campus on Monday/Tuesday “like usual”. It felt very “almost relationship”, but her general vibe is still more “safe, close friend” than clearly romantic.

How things feel now

It’s the first time in my life I feel this deep about someone with this level of daily intimacy.

My everyday life is affected: sleep issues, constant thinking, anxiety when I feel “friendzoned”.

I feel like I’m giving 80% emotionally;
she sometimes gives 50%, sometimes maybe less.

At the same time, I know she’s under a lot of pressure with studies. I know she has a history of not forming very deep attachments in relationships. She has told me she wants to live “in the now” and not think too much about later. She says she has a lot of patience and doesn’t get easily crushed or desperate.

We will both be in this city for the next 2 years for our degree, so there’s no Erasmus deadline. That probably makes her feel there is no rush to define anything.

Also, every time I give her space without disappearing, and I’m more relaxed and confident (like this week), she becomes noticeably warmer and more interested again.

A few extra details

Once, when we hadn’t seen each other for days and I was very emotionally off, I ran into her and her visiting best friend by chance on a night out.
I thought she was ignoring me and I was obsessively watching her from a distance,
but later she casually described in detail when and where I met one of her American friends that night, which means she was also watching and listening what I was doing and saying and with whom, while she was her back turned on me and she was talking and listening to another guy, while her friend was holding her from her hand.

She’s called me “darling” several times recently, even in front of her student on a video call and remembers specific details about where I was, with whom and especially dates. I tried to mention some dates that are ""important"" for our relationship and I made a mistake about the date and she corrected me about the exact date. So she’s clearly aware of me, not oblivious.

What I’ve decided for now

Together with some self-reflection and previous advice, I decided to:

Reduce intensity: see her 1–2 times per week on campus, fewer messages, no “always available” behavior, no constant favors,bno acting like a full-time boyfriend (house tasks, emotional dumping, etc.).

Keep being warm but with boundaries: short hugs, light physical contact only if natural, no initiating long “couple-like” nights at her place, keep my own life fully going (friends, travel, hobbies, work/studies).

I am NOT in a crisis right now.
I feel calm and clear-minded, just with this underlying quiet frustration:
I genuinely don’t know her intentions.

What’s eating me inside

It's not that I don't have experience with relationships. I had some girls before in my life, but I have never felt the same for any woman before and also I have never faced this situation again.

My problem is not “how long can I handle this?” – I could handle the current dynamic for quite a while if I knew what direction it might have.

My problem is the ignorance about her intentions: Is this a slow-burn thing where she could see something more with time, once stress eases and conditions are better for both of us?
or does she basically like having me as an “almost-partner”:
emotional closeness, safety, intimacy, some flirt…
but no commitment, no sex, no responsibility — and no real intention to ever go further?

I don’t want to be “boyfriend without title/payoff” while she keeps her real romantic energy for someone else later.

At the same time, I don’t want to force her into a decision right now while she’s overwhelmed with exams etc, or blow up a connection that is clearly meaningful to both of us.

What I’m thinking about doing

My rough plan (open to be challenged): keep this lower-intensity, boundaried version of our connection through the exam period. Focus on my life, studies, friends, sleep, etc.

Observe if she: still actively seeks me out 1–1, keeps the “almost couple” behavior or distances.

Then, after the heavy exam stress is over, when I’m more stable emotionally, I’m thinking of having a very calm, honest talk.

What I’d really like advice on

Am I reading the situation reasonably, or does it sound like I’m romanticizing normal friendship?

Does this “wait until after exam period + then honest talk” plan sound mature, or like I’m postponing the inevitable?

How do I avoid slipping back into “full boyfriend mode without title” while I still care this much? Any practical tips?

From a woman’s perspective:

Could this be genuine “slow-burn, I’m scared/stressed” energy?

Or does it more often mean “I like having you close, but I don’t actually see you romantically enough for a relationship”?

Is there something you think I should change right now in my behavior (either too much or too little)?

I’m not looking for “move on, she’s using you” one-liners or “just confess your love tomorrow”.
I’m trying to handle this in a way that respects both her reality and my own emotional limits.

1p7pe3a,https://i.redd.it/2bk8png1cp3g1.jpeg,_Thanksgiving 1998,"It is Thanksgiving time, and my gratitude overflows. My blessings are abundant, and my life is surely more luxurious than any who came before. Not even Solomon, the richest of all kings on earth, had life so good.

I live in a home that completely shields me from the elements. It is dry and secure and spacious enough to comfortably house my family, while still providing room for my accumulation of possessions. The floors are level and covered with carpeting. This is especially comforting in the wee hours of the morning when I need to use the bathroom. I have a BATHROOM! Not only that, but it is located in the actual house, and has running water on demand. I can take a hot bath whenever I desire..... with the smoothest, most excellent soaps that man has ever seen. I get excited just thinking about it.

I sleep on a mattress with a bed of coiled springs. Pillows cradle my head, blankets and quilts keep me warm in my sleep. Not that this is ever a problem; the house has built in heat. Simply turning a knob instantly neutralizes even the coldest of winters. I told you I was blessed.

This house has a wonderful, miraculous kitchen. Not only does it have running water on demand, like the bathroom, but it is full of electrical devices that make cooking a cinch. There is a stove and an oven with instant heat, and micro waver that will cook an entire meal in three minutes. I have machines that make coffee, popcorn, and bread..... then another machine to toast the bread, and yet another to clean the plate. The most incredible machine is the refrigerator-freezer. It keeps my food from spoiling, so milk and eggs are always handy. Even if they are not, I can run to the nearby market and be home with them in minutes. The best part is that I can do this at any time of day or night, not that I would be cooking eggs in the middle of the night, but I could. The house has electric lighting in every room.

My cupboards are full of every wonderful spice from around the world. And any delicacy from any cuisine will be served to me within the hour, if I'm willing to endure a short ride in my masterfully crafted automobile. If I'd rather stay home, I can relax in a reclining chair, while watching the world's greatest entertainers. I even have the greatest musicians of the last fifty years waiting to play my favorite songs upon command. Has anyone ever been so blessed?

My children and their friends fill the living room in my home. They laugh and play games and watch every movie of their choosing. There is just enough room here to gather all of my friends and relatives together, for this I am thankful. When friends and family are not present, I can still talk to them on the telephone or through the Internet, which allows me to meet new people from around the planet. I can also purchase any object without being limited to the still incredible variety of my local market. Abundance does indeed abound.

I can comfortably travel about 300 miles in a day, and be reasonably assured of adequate accommodation at the end of that day. With a little preparation, I can travel to any point on the globe in a matter of hours..... and I'm free to do so.

Has ever a man lived in such luxury? It doesn't end there, I have the opportunity to work and earn whatever standard my situation requires. My family of four is very comfortable even though we've never made much money.

This is Thanksgiving, the time for expressing gratitude. My blessings are abundant, but they all pale to the love that fills my home. My JOY is nearly complete, awaiting only for your own realization of abundance to join with mine.

Life is good.

1p7pcaj,https://i.redd.it/ucgczjcjbp3g1.jpeg,Thanksgiving 1998,"It is Thanksgiving time, and my gratitude overflows. My blessings are abundant, and my life is surely more luxurious than any who came before. Not even Solomon, the richest of all kings on earth, had life so good.

I live in a home that completely shields me from the elements. It is dry and secure and spacious enough to comfortably house my family, while still providing room for my accumulation of possessions. The floors are level and covered with carpeting. This is especially comforting in the wee hours of the morning when I need to use the bathroom. I have a BATHROOM! Not only that, but it is located in the actual house, and has running water on demand. I can take a hot bath whenever I desire..... with the smoothest, most excellent soaps that man has ever seen. I get excited just thinking about it.

I sleep on a mattress with a bed of coiled springs. Pillows cradle my head, blankets and quilts keep me warm in my sleep. Not that this is ever a problem; the house has built in heat. Simply turning a knob instantly neutralizes even the coldest of winters. I told you I was blessed.

This house has a wonderful, miraculous kitchen. Not only does it have running water on demand, like the bathroom, but it is full of electrical devices that make cooking a cinch. There is a stove and an oven with instant heat, and micro waver that will cook an entire meal in three minutes. I have machines that make coffee, popcorn, and bread..... then another machine to toast the bread, and yet another to clean the plate. The most incredible machine is the refrigerator-freezer. It keeps my food from spoiling, so milk and eggs are always handy. Even if they are not, I can run to the nearby market and be home with them in minutes. The best part is that I can do this at any time of day or night, not that I would be cooking eggs in the middle of the night, but I could. The house has electric lighting in every room.

My cupboards are full of every wonderful spice from around the world. And any delicacy from any cuisine will be served to me within the hour, if I'm willing to endure a short ride in my masterfully crafted automobile. If I'd rather stay home, I can relax in a reclining chair, while watching the world's greatest entertainers. I even have the greatest musicians of the last fifty years waiting to play my favorite songs upon command. Has anyone ever been so blessed?

My children and their friends fill the living room in my home. They laugh and play games and watch every movie of their choosing. There is just enough room here to gather all of my friends and relatives together, for this I am thankful. When friends and family are not present, I can still talk to them on the telephone or through the Internet, which allows me to meet new people from around the planet. I can also purchase any object without being limited to the still incredible variety of my local market. Abundance does indeed abound.

I can comfortably travel about 300 miles in a day, and be reasonably assured of adequate accommodation at the end of that day. With a little preparation, I can travel to any point on the globe in a matter of hours..... and I'm free to do so.

Has ever a man lived in such luxury? It doesn't end there, I have the opportunity to work and earn whatever standard my situation requires. My family of four is very comfortable even though we've never made much money.

This is Thanksgiving, the time for expressing gratitude. My blessings are abundant, but they all pale to the love that fills my home. My JOY is nearly complete, awaiting only for your own realization of abundance to join with mine.

Life is good.

Peace forever

This is now my 4th time.

(The 2nd time was eating heavy food right after moving. The 3rd and 4th times were immediately following viral chest infections, because the coughing messes things up).

This time, I've had to go really strict to stop the coughing and mucus.

The Acid Watcher Diet and Dr Kauffman's diets aren't strict enough for me at this point.

I thought I'd share my safe foods, in case someone else wants to experiment and see if these help.

**The main things that trigger me are fat, fiber, and volume (too much at once).**

A lot of people are aware that fatty foods are bad for LPR, but you might not know that fiber can be triggering as well.

So if you're eating a lot of vegetables and are still in a flare-up, veggies could be the problem.

All of the foods below have less than 2g of fiber and less than 1g of fat.

To get enough nutrition without eating too much volume at once, **I eat 7 times per day** (every two hours following my breakfast time), and **I** **choose two items from this list every time I eat**, such as one tilapia filet and one baby food pouch, or one nonfat yogurt cup and half a cup of cheerios.

I also had a nutritionist appointment because I was concerned about the lack of veggies and losing so much weight so fast. She said in the short term, it's more important to get the protein you need than vegetables, and that if I'm having issues with volume, I should always prioritize protein. So usually 5 of my 7 mini meals include a protein item. She also recommended MaryRuth's liquid vitamins to cover some of what I might be missing.

Here are the foods I can eat:

* Peeled English cucumber
* Peeled zucchini, cooked in nonstick pan with salt
* All sorts of baby foods: veggie/fruit mixes with less than 2g fiber per serving
* 3 slices of turkey deli meat
* 1 serving of nonfat yogurt, usually Oikos because it's higher protein (15g)
* Half a cup of honey nut cheerios
* Gluten free shortbread cookies (2-3 at a time): [https://www.amazon.com/ChocZero-Keto-Butter-Cookies-Shortbread](https://www.amazon.com/ChocZero-Keto-Butter-Cookies-Shortbread)
* 1 can of tuna with honey mustard (no mayo)
* 1 tilapia filet cooked in an inch of water in a covered nonstick pan, topped with salt and fresh chopped dill
* 1 tilapia filet cooked in an inch of water in a covered nonstick pan, topped with soy sauce, soy glaze, small amount of wasabi

I'm taking a Reflux Gourmet after my mini meals that include protein to help it go down better.

**Adding in baby food was a game-changer**, because I can get some fiber in a controlled way. (Target seems to have the best prices in my area.) I know exactly how much fiber I'm getting, so I can be careful. I also get more calories, so the weight loss can slow down a bit. One pouch of baby food might have 80 calories, whereas you'd have to eat an entire English cucumber just to get 45 calories.

To combat the lack of fiber, I take Miralax to keep things moving.

Next week, I'm going to try adding cooked egg whites.

I'll keep adding one food every 2 weeks hopefully, and climb my way out of this once again!

Hopefully in a few weeks, I'll be able to add back small amounts of fiber and fat, like a small salad and a bit of butter.

I hope this helps anyone who isn't seeing progress with their current diet!

I used chat gpt to fix spelling errors and things like that but I completely wrote this before even putting it in there! Just a cute story about a trucker and his Lil cat homie


Nine Lives on the Open Road


Chapter 1 — Born for the Highway

The first time the kitten opened his eyes, the world was humming.

Not the soft hum of a home or the chatter of a crowded place—this was a deep, steady vibration. A diesel engine. A heartbeat made of steel and fuel.

He blinked slowly, his tiny body curled inside an old flannel jacket on the passenger seat of a long‑haul Kenworth. The jacket smelled like motor oil, coffee, and the man who had saved him only two nights earlier.

That man—Tommy Rivers—looked down at the kitten with tired eyes and a grin hiding under a greying beard.

""Mornin’, little road rat,"" Tommy said, scratching the kitten's head with a calloused thumb. ""You’re gonna see more of this country than most folks ever will.""

The kitten didn’t know many things yet. But he knew this man was safe. And the rumbling truck felt like home.

What Tommy didn’t know—what nobody alive knew—was that this tiny scrap of fur wasn’t just a kitten.

He had ridden these roads before.

In another body. In another life.

He had been a trucker once.

And now he was back.

Chapter 2 — Memories on Paws

The kitten didn’t have words for his memories. Not yet. They came in flashes—headlights stretching down an endless Montana night, the smell of diesel mixing with rain, the echo of a CB radio crackling with friendly voices.

He didn’t remember his old name. But he remembered the road.

Every time Tommy shifted gears, the kitten’s tail twitched with an old, familiar rhythm.

Tommy drove one hand on the wheel, the other resting near the kitten as if to make sure he hadn’t wandered off. ""Gonna call you Rookie,"" Tommy said. ""Every good trucker starts as a rookie. And you? You’re startin’ fresh.""

Rookie.

The kitten liked it. But deep inside, it stirred something older—a name he’d once answered to across truck stops and state lines.

As the truck rolled westward, Rookie climbed onto the dashboard and watched the horizon stretch out before them.

The road was long.

And he was ready for it.

Chapter 3 — First Fuel Stop

The Kenworth hissed as it pulled into a dusty truck stop outside Rapid City. Rookie lifted his head, ears perked to the chorus of engines idling like a mechanical choir.

The moment Tommy opened the door, Rookie bounded onto the dash, staring out at the maze of trailers, boots, and neon lights.

And then—something strange.

A flicker in his mind.

A memory of this same stop… but he’d been taller. Human. Drinking bitter coffee at 3 a.m.

Rookie shook it off.

Tommy scooped him into his jacket. ""C’mon, Rookie. First lesson of road life—never trust gas‑station burritos.""

Rookie wasn’t worried about burritos. Not when a trucker walking past suddenly froze, looked down at him, and whispered:

""…No way. You look just like him…""

But the man kept walking, leaving Rookie disturbed and curious.

Chapter 4 — Ghosts in the CB Radio

Back on the highway, Tommy flicked on the CB.

Crackle. Static. A couple truckers joking about weather.

Then another voice cut through.

Deep. Familiar.

""Breaker one‑nine… anyone ridin’ with a little black‑and‑white cat?"" the voice asked.

Rookie’s fur stood straight up.

Tommy laughed. ""Heh. Word gets around fast, Rookie.""

But Rookie knew that voice.

He’d shared convoys with it.

He’d died the same night that voice went silent.

Chapter 5 — Trouble on the Mountain Pass

Snow fell hard as they climbed a twisting Colorado pass. The truck slipped once—twice—Rookie digging claws into the seat.

Tommy muttered, ""Road’s iced up bad…""

Suddenly, a pair of headlights swerved around a bend, barreling straight at them.

Tommy yanked the wheel.

Rookie yowled.

The world spun.

But then—out of nowhere—an old memory kicked in. Rookie leapt up and batted the steering wheel just enough to correct their slide.

The truck straightened.

Tommy stared at Rookie.

""…How’d you know to do that?""

Rookie didn’t know how to explain he’d survived this exact pass once before.

Chapter 6 — The Man Who Recognized Him

When they pulled into a diner to warm up, Rookie spotted the same man from Rapid City.

The man froze again.

Then he knelt.

""I knew it,"" he whispered. ""You’re him. You’re Chance Walker.""

Rookie’s heart thudded.

That name.

His old name.

Tommy frowned. ""Buddy, he’s just a cat.""

The man shook his head. ""Chance saved my life on I‑90 years back. And that cat—he looks at me the same way Chance did that night.""

Rookie rubbed his head against the man’s hand.

He remembered.

The crash. The fire. The last thing he saw.

Headlights. His friend pulling him from the wreck.

Then darkness.

Chapter 7 — A Cat With a Past

Back in the truck, Rookie curled in Tommy’s lap as the engine rumbled on.

Tommy sighed. ""Chance, huh? You had a whole life before me. Guess we all got ghosts on the road.""

Rookie didn’t understand why he was back.

But he felt a reason pulling him forward.

A place he needed to reach.

A person he needed to find.

Chapter 8 — The Highway Stranger

Late that night, a battered pickup tailgated them for miles.

Then it pulled alongside.

The driver’s window rolled down.

A man with sunken eyes shouted, ""That cat! Pull over! NOW!""

Tommy swore and sped up.

The pickup swerved closer.

Rookie’s memories slammed into him—this man had been there the night he died.

He wasn’t a friend.

He was the reason Chance Walker never made it home.

Chapter 9 — Escape at Dead Man’s Turn

Tommy whipped the rig down an exit ramp toward an abandoned weigh station.

The pickup followed.

Rookie leapt onto the CB and slammed a paw onto the transmit button.

""Break—!"" Tommy yelped. ""You tryin’ to call for help?""

Static.

Then—

""You ain’t losin’ me this time, Walker!"" the pickup driver shouted from outside.

Rookie hissed.

He wasn’t Walker anymore.

But he still had one life left to fight with.

Chapter 10 — The Final Flashback

The man approached with a tire iron.

Rookie’s vision blurred—time folding back.

The fire.

The overturned truck.

The man stealing cargo before leaving him to burn.

Rookie snapped back, trembling.

Tommy stepped in front of him. ""Back off!""

Just as the man swung, headlights flooded the lot.

A convoy of trucks roared in.

The CB had worked.

Truckers poured out, chasing the attacker away.

Rookie collapsed against Tommy with relief.

Chapter 11 — Justice on the Road

Police arrested the man the next morning.

Tommy gave Rookie a gentle scratch. ""Sounds like he’d been runnin’ from this for a long time. Guess you finally caught him, Rookie.""

Rookie wasn’t sure if that was true.

But he felt lighter.

Like he’d closed a door left open for too many miles.

Chapter 12 — A New Life, A New Name

As dawn lit the open plains, Rookie sat tall on the dash, tail flicking proudly.

Tommy smiled. ""You ain’t just a rookie anymore. What d’you say we call you Chance? In honor of the trucker you used to be.""

Rookie meowed softly.

Not as a memory.

But as acceptance.

Chance—the cat—watched the road ahead.

A new life.

A second run.

The highway stretched endlessly before them.

And this time… he wouldn’t drive it alone.

The delivery for this order specifically said to leave at the door. However, the dasher knocked. So, I answered the door. Exchange of pleasantries, and goodnight. 

I received a follow-up message of the dasher giving me his number. 

I reported. 

I also gave the dasher a run down of ""not okay bro"". 

Just wanted to check myself... was i wrong to either/or/and call out dasher + report??? 

In my opinion, this dude knows where I live and what I look like. It's an imbalance of power that no woman, especially one living alone, should fear.

My dad is currently in the ICU, so I was on the phone with my mom shortly after. She told me that I was wrong to report this person, because he might get fired/banned. I think he should be banned if he thinks it's okay to hit on the women who open the door. ""You could have just warned him and been nice. There's not a lot of nice people out there.""

Nothing out of the ordinary she flipped her shit and went straight to hr. hr talked to me About so I said no worries I’ll change it up. She was nice about it she her thought this was a stupid thing to talk about. But the executive said using cheers is to casual and it establishes that we are equals when we are not. So I apologized and continue my work. I thought this was the end of it. But today they called me said I was let go as she brought this email to owner of the company he decided to let me go.

Last night's broadcast was different. The voice wasn't alone anymore. There were others in the background; whispers, fragments of conversations overlapping. And beneath it all, that wind-through-empty-buildings sound, constant now.

""Marcus. Tonight, someone will come to your station at exactly 3:33 AM. A woman. She'll buy coffee and ask you about the highway conditions. You will tell her to take Old Miller Road. You will tell her it's faster. You will insist.""

I felt sick. Old Miller Road has been closed for six months after the bridge collapsed. There are signs, barriers, everything - but at night, if you're not familiar with the area...

""I won't."" I said to the empty store. ""I won't do it.""

The radio - the smashed pieces still sitting in the trash - crackled to life.

""Then you'll take her place. We need someone on that road tonight, Marcus. Someone has to see what's waiting there. If it's not her, it's you.""

The broadcast went silent.

It's 3:28 AM now. My hands won't stop shaking. There's a car pulling into the lot - a blue sedan, a woman getting out. I can see her from here, checking her phone, heading toward the door.

I could lie. I could tell her the truth about Old Miller Road. I could warn her.

But then what happens to me? What's waiting on that road? What did the man in the red jacket photograph?

1p7p59b,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1p7p59b/first_day_eating_unrestricted_in_7_months/,First day eating unrestricted in 7 months. Struggling to cope,"The guilt is killing me, I feel mentally awful and physically uncomfortable since I ate an amount of food that is significantly over my restriction intake. I celebrated Thanksgiving with my family today, and despite having a panic attack beforehand, I decided to let myself eat whatever I wanted without tracking or weighing anything. Just last week I freaked out going 40 calories over my intake so this is incredibly fucking hard. Throughout the course of today, I ate:

• About 3/4 cup of mashed potatoes 

• Like 7 oz of turkey breast

• Maybe 2 cups of really oily roasted brussel sprouts

• ~ 1.5 cup of green beans with ham

• Two dinner rolls

• Two 3x3 inch pieces of corn casserole

• Two pieces of pumpkin pie

• One 1x1 inch sliver of coffee cake

I don’t usually eat like this, this is way more than I’d typically eat in a day even before relapsing, particularly the amount of dessert, which I was the most nervous about. I’m trying to cope by just telling myself that it’s Thanksgiving and a lot of people “overindulge” but I feel like a glutton. 

My brain is screaming at me that I’m going to gain a bunch of weight because prior to today I’ve been eating at maintenance for about a month (my maintenance intake is really, really low due to my BMI being >!14.8!<). I probably ate at least 2.5x my maintenance and I feel horrible, I’ve sworn off trying to calculate the exact calories because I know it will make me feel awful. I’ve been dealing with really bad constipation and GI issues too so the bloating is awful too and it’s making me feel even worse.

I wish I could be proud of myself. Everyone keeps saying they’re really proud of me but I just feel like a failure.

The worst part is that everything tasted so fucking good and I missed it so much. I forgot that food could taste like that, all of my safe foods are so bland and largely lacking in flavor and diet versions of food obviously do not taste the same, so it was insane eating all of that. It felt too indulgent almost. I’m terrified I won’t be able to go back to normal restriction after this because I’ve had a taste of what life could be like outside of this disorder and it was good. That scares me.

My food noise and hunger has been crazy lately, it’s like my body is trying to propel me into recovery before my brain is ready :( I’m petrified and don’t even know what I’m going to do tomorrow. 

I decided I’m not going to restrict below maintenance because I realistically know I need to gain weight, and I’m not trying to create a binge/restrict pattern, I truly want to normalize these types of foods again. But the fear of weight gain, though necessary, is so fucking incapacitating.

I (28F) have been with my husband (30M) for going on 13 years now. We are high school sweethearts who grew up in walking distance of each other. We moved into a shared home 8 years ago (I was 20, he was 21) and got engaged after 2 years. We got married 3 years ago (engaged for 3 years).


Over the years, he's been emotionally abusive. I didn't think it was until sharing my experience with my therapist and reddit(through several deleted posts over the years). But he has a very unpredictable mood and will go from 0 to 100 very quickly. Examples from over the years in no particular order:

- He spoke harshly to me about something small, and our mutual friends called him out on it. He started yelling about how everyone was against him, nobody liked him, he must be the worst person ever, etc, locked himself in the bathroom while saying he just deserved to die, and then spent 12 hours isolating in the bedroom refusing to speak to me. He didn't snap out of it until I told him he was fine, nobody was mad at him, etc. 

- We lived in a second story apt and he would snap at me for walking too heavily and say that I was going to piss the neighbors off. He, in the same apt, would rage against video games and bang his hand/controller and yell loudly. 

- I had a bad family emergency and went into what my therapist considered ""survival mode"" for a little over a month. He got upset that I was putting him on the back burner and not prioritizing him. I asked if he would consider going to couples therapy (we've gone before) and he said no because it was not a ""him"" problem and therefore not an ""us' problem. 

- He will snap at me and talk down to me over little things (ie leaving headphones on the coffee table, forgetting to put a dish away, for stepping in front of him on accident, for generally being in the way.)

- If I try to leave him a little hand drawn picture or note, he will (and has) tear it up, crumple it, or throw it away while telling me he hates notes or cards. 

-i had been sleeping through my alarm on accident and they woke him up one morning. He yelled and yelled about it, slammed stuff, threw stuff around. I dropped something on the floor by the bathroom door for a second so I could rush to pee, and while I bent down to pick it up he threw open the door hard into my head. He didn't know I was behind it, he was just angry that I dropped something onto the floor like that when we have cats that might pick at it. 

My therapist has also pointed out ways we just aren't compatible people, like me wanting more romance and physical touch (like holding my hand in public, or doing little romantic gestures) . Or that he won't play anything competitive with me because of his temper so no board games, video games, etc unless on rate occasion he plays a card game. He's never really gotten along with my friends and now I don't really have any friends that aren't his. He's skipped out on going to my extended familys funerals with me because it makes him uncomfortable. He doesn't like me driving anywhere so he drives every time but his driving scares me. Just a bunch of little things. 

A few months ago I gave him an ultimatum that he had to get therapy and psychiatry or I was leaving. He followed through and got both. He's been genuinely improving over the last couple of months especially, and I'm confident that he can be a better version of himself within a couple of years. But one of the above incidents (the bathroom door) happened just a couple of weeks ago. So the improvement isn't consistent yet. It's still unpredictable.

He recently mentioned that he wanted to start thinking about kids and I can't stop thinking about how scared I am to have kids with this man. With his mood being unpredictable   like that, I can't imagine how he would react to a baby crying all night and keeping him up, or a toddler climbing all over him and overstimulating him with a bunch of questions, or a 4 year old getting mad and hitting hard, or a teenager and the never ending attitude. I like to think he would eventually grow to be a great dad but what about in the beginning? And what if he's a great dad but still takes out frustration and bad moods on me? Do I want kids seeing that?

I don't know exactly when I'm going to leave, but if I want the living situation I want to be in, I have to decide and be out by new years. That's terrifying to me. But also exciting. I don't know who I am without him or not being at his side but I'd like to think I could start being the best version of myself too.

**Option #1:**

I'm \[REDACTED\], looking for someone who values faith, intention, and building something real together. On the weekends, I like getting out and exploring whether it’s hiking new trails, visiting museums, checking out antique shops, or admiring mid-century architecture (fair warning, I'm a bit obsessed). I’m big on cooking and experimenting with new recipes, most turn out great but the occasional disaster keeps things interesting. I’m always learning, digging into new ideas, and listening to lectures that challenge my perspective and expand my understanding of the world. At the end of the day, I'm looking for a genuine connection with someone who wants to grow, explore, and experience life together, someone I can laugh with through the wins and the occasional kitchen fails.

**Option #2:**

I’m \[REDACATED\]. I’m big on cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I like getting out and exploring, from antique shops and museums to hiking and camping trips that recharge me. I'm a mid-century architecture enthusiast, so I’ll point out cool mid-century houses and furniture whenever I come across them. I’m always learning, digging into new ideas, and listening to anything that challenges my perspective and expand my understanding of the world. At the end of the day, I’m looking for someone genuine, who values a meaningful connection and wants to grow, explore, and build a solid life together.

**Option #3**

I’m \[REDACATED\], curious and creative. I find joy in almost anything, whether it’s getting lost in an art museum, wandering through an antique store, or checking out a coffee shop. Fall trips to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula are my favorite, immersing myself in nature and hiking as my favorite way to take it all in. I'm a bit of a mid-century design enthusiast, so heads up, I’ll probably point out cool mid-century houses and furniture whenever I come across them! I find joy in learning and exploring new ideas, and I enjoy deep conversations and lectures that broaden my perspective. Ultimately, I’m looking for a best friend to share life with, someone who values a meaningful connection and wants to grow, explore, and experience life together. Laughter is an essential ingredient in life, and I would deeply cherish the moments that spark joy and bring us closer together.",2,1764205769.0,MuslimNikah,8,1.0,False
1p7p30o,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1p7p30o/rabid_mary/,Rabid Mary,"Mary doesn't have a mouth. She does. She just can't use it when she is required to. All that would come out would be faint, gentle whispers or a low tone of voice. And sometimes Mary's voice would simply get caught inside of her throat when she would make try to speak. Mary doesn't have any friends. Mary lived alone.  But Mary had Jed. An unknown black spider that happened to share a room with her. He often comes out from behind her curtains to visit her at night. Sometimes Mary was even allowed to pet him. Jed's company was always something special to her.

But one day, Mary came home and her front door was already unlocked. Who had her access to her house if she had the keys? Luckily for Mary, nothing was stolen or touched. But Jed's body was brutally mutilated on the floor. A giant puddle of blood covering Mary's floor in her room. Mary didn't cry. She simply disposed of his scattered body parts. Dying her hair black and wearing only black attire so she could still keep his presence flowing through her afterwards. It was certainly a bit much, But at the end of the day, Mary never had anyone else.

One day after work, when Mary was leaving she saw a 7 ft tall man wearing a white rabbit costume watching her from the bushes. Mary quickly left the area and drove home.

The next day she was making herself a warm cup of coffee before dumping it immediately into the sink. Mary wasn't that thirsty anyway.

She put on her black trenchcoat and opened the door before finding a basket on the ground in front of her. There was a letter as well but Mary had crunched it up and put it aside for now.

She opened up the basket and inside were a bunch of rabbits.

Mary immediately froze. Out of fear, She started stomping on each of them as hard as she could until her heels were completely bloodied.

Mary wiped her heels clean and drove back to her workplace again.

When Mary had got there it was busy. More busy than usual. Important day probably.

""Late again, Are we?"" Mary's boss said when she came in.

She looked at him blankly before whispering.
""Yes..."" There it was.

""I want you here earlier from now on. Understood?"" He said to her sternly.

Again. Another whisper.
""Sure...""

""You look pretty, Mary."" He said before walking off.

""Thanks..."" Mary said quietly under her breath.

Mary got back to her office and left once again when her shift was finished.

When Mary got back she found another letter and basket left by her front door. This time she opened the letter. Anxiety slowly building up inside of her as she did so.

It simply read as follows.
""I see you.""

Mary's blood ran cold. Who was watching her from her house? Who could see her? And where could they see her?

""Don't... H-Hurt... Me..."" Mary stated with as much loudness as she could, Her words getting caught in her throat as she tried to speak.

Mary could smell the rotting scent coming from the basket. She wouldn't dare open it and see what was inside.

This caused Mary very intense fear that over the next few days she was forced to wait for the white rabbit to show up. Ignoring work. Standing in front of the front door 24/7. Waiting.

Eventually, It did show up. And instead of dropping a note he came straight for her when he saw her waiting for him by the front door.

Mary didn't move an inch. She was paralyzed the whole time just from waiting. Her skin was now pale like the snow and her cheeks looked slightly more thinner than before. The white rabbit then took off it's mask and revealed itself to her. His body just barely an inch away from hers.

""Dad...?"" Mary said, feeling like screaming even though her mouth wouldn't let her.

""Hey, Sweetheart. Did you miss your beloved father?"" He said. As if he knew Mary didn't feel comfortable at all with him being there.

""You... You're my... Tormentor..."" Mary delicately added before continuing.

""Get... Get... Get out..."" Mary whispered. Her voice barely audible as she looked up at him.

He put back on his mask again before patting her head and then leaving.

Still frozen with fear, Mary swung open her front door to stop her jerking movements and quickly picked up the letter she had previously crunched up.

It reads as follows.
""Hi, Honey. It's me, your father. I know you hate me, but I thought you should know I've always loved you no matter what happened between us. I thought I'd bring you some rabbits. Your favourite."" From The Easter Bunny.

And just like that, All the memories came flooding back to her.

One year later, Mary finally got herself a partner and shared a brand new home with him.

Max, Her partner. Noticed Mary zoning out a lot of the time. Occasionally crying at random times during day, and waking up with tears in her eyes. Max always asked if she was okay whenever she cried. And Mary always responded with-

""I love you, Baby."" Mary said in a very soothing tone. A reassuring tone that often eased Max's concerns and worries about her.

This night was different however.
Max was sleeping in early due to having worked all day today at his shift. Max wasn't aware of it yet, But Mary was already consuming him starting from his feet up.

By the next morning, Max finally awoke with only his head and his chest remaining. Max was confused, He should've been dead. But he turned his head and noticed some ominous injections laying on the table beside him.

Probably what was keeping him alive for so long.

When Mary finally returned to him, she smiled. Mary's face was unrecognisable. Her eye sockets were stretched and where her eyes should be were now replaced with an empty void of darkness. Black. Empty. And she wore a pair of rabbit ears on her head.

Mary spoke. Answering Max's question before it was even uttered.

""The rabbits. They call me their queen. They pray. And they pray to me. They do not hurt. But they love. And they love me. My dear beloved children will save the rest of you for later when the harvest begins. For they are but satisfied for now.""

Mary cuddled up to Max's cut up body on the mattress. Ending her torment for now as she rested.",1,1764205727.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
