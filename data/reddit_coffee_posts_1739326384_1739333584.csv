Breakfast included 2 fish balls, while dinner had 1-2 extra ""proteins"" - a tiny piece of lean fish, hamburger, tempura, or fish / pork katsu. And miso soup

Lunch was always 2 milk breads (231 cal 8.3g protein each) and came with grape jam, orange jam, or honey, and a drink (mon-sun: apple juice, grape, coffee, apple, grape, coffee, lemonade)

Meals all had soy sauce and katsu sauce on the side (I was supplementing soy sauce for my protein lol) And hojicha

Showers were T/F, until Nov. 1 ""winter"" in which it became every 5 days.

I'd love to be able to really appreciate fully the subtleties, coplexity and quality of great coffee. So how do I get there?

1iniayw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostlyEncounters/comments/1iniayw/entity_plays_parquet_with_the_queen_of_head_games/,Entity Plays Parquet with The Queen of Head Games,"Entity sat in the shadow of an old oak tree, beside a crooked sign barely visible through the fog. The sign read Black Oak Witches astrology class.  It was an old sign from the 90s,  back when Black Oak was full of visionaries and fortune tellers there to service the people that came to town to visit the healing spring in the mountains.   Entity stared dismissively at the lady spoking a cigarette in the lawn chair beside him. He was relieved when she put the cigarette  butt in the dog poopy canister.  He followed her back to the hotel, taking his place at the check-in window.

Inside, the air was thick, filled with the scent of burnt coffee and something else—something sweet, yet rotten.

Entity was once a man, a cog in a corporate machine.  Then machine ground to a halt. The bankruptcy came suddenly, like a thief in the night. One moment he was an employee moving into top management, the next he was cast aside.

His aunt took him in.  They were needing someone to run the hotel.  They were away on cruises to Germany and the Nordic seas.  Entity jumped on the chance to run a hotel.

He needed something to dull the pain.  He'd started to learn to cook while he was there.  And hike.  Entity became known among all the locals for his ability to forage plants in the area.

""Would you like to sign up for the buffet with your hotel stay,"" Entity asked the lady noticing her red nails.  He wondered why red nailed ladies always smoke.

""I have my own pie,'"" said the lady pulling a small white pastry box from her luggage.  Her red nails  opened it and suddenly Entity realized this was the source of the rotten smell in the lobby.  Despite smelling sickly sweet, the pie was enticing, a golden crust that seemed to glow.  Entity ran his nose over the warm crust. He couldn't resist it.  He took a bite. It was sweet and warm, but laced with something else—something fungus like. Something stenchy.

Suddenly, he was spiraling. The world around him twisting and turning. Voices echoing, fading in and out, like whispers carried by the wind. The Spiral of Time enveloped him, a dark abyss stretching infinitely. Here, he found himself drifting through a dark tunnel.

And at the end of the tunnel, was the lady.  She was sitting on the same chair by the Black Oak tree, smoking a cigarette.

""It's about time you showed up, I was looking for you."" she pointed him to sit in the lawn chair beside her.

But then she swiftly sliced his head off.   Entity watched his head roll across the grass like a game of parquet.  It landed on a lucky piece.  The lady slashed her own head off and it rolled into the other parquet spot.

""You win,"" the lady's head said from the ground.

And in this ghostly state, Entity realized the truth.

He awoke on a train, the rhythmic clattering of wheels a cruel reminder of reality.

The truth was Entity was endlessly riding the train, each day, pretending he was going to work.

People surrounded him, lost in their own worlds. But there, in the corner of the train, a woman lit a cigarette. The acrid smell invaded his senses, a reminder of something familiar.

Entity stood up.  “Do you mind?” he snapped, his voice sharp. The lady glanced up, eyes narrowing.

Entity felt a surge of rage. He couldn’t face the world smelling like smoke, couldn’t let the lingering scent of failure cling to him. In a fit of fury, he lunged, striking the lady as hard as he could.

The lady laughed at him. “You crazy?”  She said lunging forward.  ""Boo! You missed.""

But Entity was lost. The Spiral of Time wound back around him. He felt weightless, detached from the chaos. In that haze, he saw it all—his life, his choices, spiraling into darkness.

And he went to strike the lady again, just to realize his arm went right through her. He pinched his own arm realizing it wasn't there.

He spun around looking at everyone. Could they even see him.

The train rattled violently, plunging deeper down into the abyss.

He was not just a ghos nowt; he was a ghost trapped in robes made of rage, shame, and despair.  The train headed straight down into the bowels of the Earth.

“Stop! Just stop!” a woman cried, her voice cutting through the fog. She reached for Entity, her eyes full of tears.  “You don’t have to die.  You dont have to do this! Decide to wake up!”

Suddenly, the train screeched to a halt. The doors flung open, tossing Entity into the the world outside, bright and blinding. Entity stumbled forward, but then turned around to stare at the passengers speed away into the pitch dark.  The passengers were not faceless shadows at he expected. They were all Entity - staring back at him.  Their eyes bore into him, judging him.

Entity wanted to hide, but where could he go? The streets were empty. He wandered aimlessly.

In the distance, he saw the lady with a cigarette.  She was coming in from the curb outside. The hospital doors spun open releasing her.

“What are you doing out of your room,” the lady said calling at Entity.  She was on her walkie talkie asking for back-up.  Entity froze, the realization crashing over him, this lady was following him.

She turned him into a ghost.  It was her.

""We've been looking for you,"" the lady said, ""you're not supposed to leave without the doctor's signing off, do you understand,"" the lady asked Entity.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ini9r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/1ini9r0/i_dont_even_drink_coffee/,I dont even drink coffee!,"I was picking up someone else's order from a coffee place. We're not supposed to say which one so let's just say it's that one. The one you think it was. THE one. 

I go to pick it up and i get a request to take a photo of the receipt so i figure, no big deal, let me ask for one. So i ask for a receipt, the lady tells me they dont do that. Under no circumstances do they print receipt... I say i dont get how that's possible, you have to give people proof of purchase, i can see the machine that prints them, are you telling me you can't figure out how to print one or what? She offers to call her store manager and let me talk to them. 

Sound good. I say okay. She starts to dial and then looks up at me, smirks, says ""i'll make sure and tell him i did everything to try and talk to you"" i say ""i dont think you did, but lets go ahead and talk to the manager"" she starts trying to tell me how i'm wrong and she really tried very hard to impress upon me that she can't print a receipt, so i said ""Can you just go ahead and make the call? Right now it seems like you dont want me to talk to your manager."" and then she tells me to leave. I ask her why, she says i interrupted her. I try to tell her i didn't, she cuts me off, i restart and she cuts me off like three more times and i let her. She says she's calling the cops which honestly i'm thinking has got to be bullshit. I wont lie, i'm sweating a little by that point, this is all so out of left field and she could've just called the manager.  

So the cops show up, they take statements from myself and her, they dont tell me what she said the problem was but i'm not in trouble or anything, they just impress on me that there's no legal standard for trespassing and if a company doesn't want your buisness they can call the cops to toss you out for no reason. It doesn't sit right with me. 

Strap in folks. If you thought this would be simple you were wrong. 

I get on the phone with the very large coffee companies CS department and after i explain the situation the girl says ""why dont you just go down there and try to talk to them?"" like.... are you TRYING to get me arrested? I pretty much say that and i get a district manager phone number and a case number via email. I call that number, leave a message, get a call back and he wants to hear my side so i tell him what happened. It takes about two months to hear back from this guy, at which point he tells me that because police were involved i'm banned for six months, he says his hands are tied which is nonsense. It seems to not matter that he can't come up with a good reason for my being asked to leave or for the cops being called and he directs me to the legal department of the very big coffee company if i had any further questions. 

I had further questions. This ain't right, he knows it, she knew it. Anybody would know it. So i go back through the CS department by email with the same email i had already used, i tell them i'm looking for contact info for their legal dept per the direction of their district manager on last contact. They create a different CS ticket labeled ""anonymous anonymous"" and email me a boilerplate apology, i email back with the original case number and ask once again for their legal dept phone number. Instead they give me the CS phone number. Heres where things get weirder. The first person i speak to tells me my case number wont load, just a blank white screen. She offers to direct me to a supervisor. The whole time there's all kinds of background noise and as i speak with her she's doing ""yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, go on"" while i'm talking, i'm just trying to get details on if this is normal or if she knows what the issue is or if she can ask a co worker for help. The supervisor tries to tell me that i'm not allowed to contact their legal department without actually retaining a ""legal team"" which is just a straight up lie and then he transfers me to a manager who sounds a lot like the first person i spoke to. She tells me that they hadn't gotten any update after they'd give me the manager contact info. She refused to transfer me to another manager or to any other person on the CS team, so i gave her the full story on the recorded line, she offered me a 20$ gift card which i declined and then i hung up. I got an email from the QC department of the big coffee company with the legal teams phone number.   


So, get ready for another level of weird. I started looking for legal advice, because if i'm doing this i dont want to go in blind, i post on a free legal advice board in my state and i post on reddit. The legal advice section is a ghost town and my post is eventually automatically removed with 0 replies. On reddit my post gets removed with the comment from a moderator ""Get outta' Miami lebowski"", later edited to ""Stay outta Miami"". I had no idea what that meant and had to find out it's a movie quote or something. I tried to follow up with the moderators to find out what rule i had broken by posting and they have not replied to date, three months later. 

I wish there were some kind of happy ending i could add on here, but to date i'm still not allowed back at that particular location, they have not reached out to try and explain the situation or to make things right, and by all accounts i've been cut off from seeking legal advice and the only lawyers i reached out to who specialized in consumer law replied ""not my specialty""...  At this point i'm posting to vent more than anything. I've actually got a few more stories of a similar nature, but lets see how this lands first. ",1,1739332795.0,TalesFromTheCustomer,0,0.67,False

The anime is actually what got me into coffee in the first place as a teenager, and since then, I’ve tried coffee from almost every part of the world, and possibily every brewing method out there.

Now, I’m heavily considering launching a Tokyo Ghoul-inspired coffee brand. I have the background and expertise for it, and I’d love to create something that truly captures the cozy, nostalgic vibe of Anteiku. I already have a few ideas like creating ""centipede"" themed packaging for a strong, rich roast and ""Spider Lily flower"" one that is a light roast that has a fruity/citrus tasting notes.

I’ve been traveling in Southeast Asia for a while now, and something unexpected happened, I’ve had way less heartburn than usual. Back home, I had to be really careful with what I ate, but here, even though I’ve started drinking coffee again, my stomach feels much better.

I’m guessing it might be because of the coffee itself. Most of the coffee here is made with Robusta beans, which have a different composition than the Arabica I usually drank at home. Vietnamese filter coffee, in particular, has been a game-changer for me.

Another factor could be my eating schedule. Here, I tend to have my last meal much earlier than I would back home, which might also be helping.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Would love to hear your thoughts!",2,1739332514.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Now I love my bestie (Marie F17) but she truly believes that her standards of love are the true standards.

It’s so irritating and after listening to her complain about how “Oh so and so didn’t tell me about her valentines date until the last moment, I can’t believe she would blow me off like that”.

Mind you, me, Marie, and another bestie of mine were SUPPOSED to spend Valentine’s Day together, since they were both single and my boyfriend is on a ski trip.  BUTT neither girl told me until later that they BOTH made different plans (Bestie 2 met a guy from a dating app and Marie picked up a last minute shift). 

My irritation must’ve looked like I was irritated at Bestie 2 to Marie cause she kept going but by the time I dropped her off, I had a migraine.

Honestly I don’t give af what my girls do as long as they’re safe and not doing something just to fill a hole that will bite them later or bite the group later. They’re smart enough to run their own private circus of crazy but I want a break from drama.

But relationships and Marie are always drama.

Just today I’m giddly telling the girls about how my bf and I finally became official 2 days ago. It’s made me so happy and he treats me incredibly and I always love matching energy back. 

However I know im a bit over the top hopeless romantic, and when pairing that with a sweetheart charmer like him, Im addicted.

So I was telling the girls about whether or not I should give him this Funko pop or not (It’s of a inside joke between me and him and I bet he’d love it 🥹💕💕- and I kinda already bought it).

Our adopted guy of the group was saying that my bf would love it and was hyping me up, the girl across from me was cooing at how romantic I am and I was cooing back cause she was working on a 500 pg scrapbook for her man (Which I told her to lower to 100 and she reluctantly agreed)-

And it was really nice vibes until Marie was like “Oh what’s he gotten you though?”

My bf isn’t a direct gift giver- hell he’s a bit…dense when it comes to that. He values Quality time more and I love Acts of service and GIVING gifts more (Because I hate being in people’s debts, though if it’s jewlery I’ll wear for years, I have a friendship bracelet what I haven’t taken off in 4 years). 

Anyways my bf besides that does incredible work. 3 hour driving for every date. Pays for me when I allow him to (I live with a financially abusive mom, I prefer right now that he asks rather than immediately pays until we build up to that. And he knows that). He DREW me on our date because I mentioned ONCE loving getting keepsakes of each date. I love this man dearly and he is the most respectful gentlest man ever. 

Yes I like getting him elaborate gifts that might not make sense for ‘gender norms’ like a rose and two coffees at the gas station while still on the date with him (he tried to pay for his own gifts but I gave him the “🥰no” smile and he just sighed and started chuckling). I did plan the whole first date but he planed the second and still let me have some secure control cause he knows I like that. 

I was immediately irritated that Marie was suddenly undermining all that because there wasn’t a ‘non consumable gift’ besides the art. 

Suddenly the convo turned from being excited about a gift to “He should do more, he should pay more-“

I don’t like owing people and these small gifts are nowhere near the gas price that he runs through. Marie knows this, Marie knows my mom, Marie just can’t be happy for me 100 percent. 

I asked for advice on whether it’d be too much to get him something he’d like and she turned it into a lecture.

I showed her some funny text messages of mine and his, she turned it into “Wow that’s a lot 😟 He sounds clingy”.

It’s just always something negative with relationships-

But the thing is that if you don’t tell her she’ll get pissed. Bestie 2 got on Marie’s pissed off list cause Marie eavesdropped on Bestie 2’s convo with another girl to find out that Bestie 2 is dating again.

And the scrapbook girl is always under heat by Marie because her boyfriend is a giant red flag that NONE of us like- however Scrapbook is very stubborn and loyal. We’ve tried convincing her to leave but nothing works, and for my own mental peace I just left it at “Girl you’re smart and you know this is your life, It’s not my business to tell you how to live as long as you are living and not surviving” and I told her to never bring the guy near the girls unless it’s her birthday or a special event, she agreed (I’m not going to go in detail but I said that because multiple girls felt uncomfortable about how scrapbook was being treated and her and I had a long talk).

But Marie? Oh she’ll be saying some sly insult at scrapbook at the same level as the boyfriend smh. I told Marie that she and scrapbook’s arguments were going to tear their friendship apart or make the other girls uncomfortable. Marie kept going tho and she only stopped when I said she needed to stop before she gets consumed by it and starts emotionally projecting more. She settled down after that but still does some random huffs or dramatics.

I feel like Marie is constantly projecting though. Just in general to people, anytime love is mentioned. I know it’s a coping tactic but I also know that it hurts. I don’t know how to approach this.",2,1739332388.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1ini0zx,https://i.redd.it/diqe8q2yqmie1.jpeg,found a necklace I lost; feeling a bit overwhelmed,"I’m a bit afraid to talk about this because I don’t know if the things I’ve experienced lately are things I want to explain away as the gods answering my prayers when logically it maybe is more easily explained away as general self maintenance and the benefits it leads to. I don’t know. The thing about my body healing after 9 years was too much for me to believe it was just because I was taking care of myself better, when I’d done loads before to try to heal that part of me on my own and with doctors to no avail.

And then things in my life took a tiny detour in a direction that had me, regrettably, questioning their motives or if they even exist. To be fair I fully believe in them, I’m slowly coming out of that detour and trying to get things back on track and not falter when it comes to my love and belief in them. And tonight, to me, solidified that belief once again.

My ex gave me this necklace three months after we started dating in 2021 for my birthday. It has a little glass ball thing that you look through and there’s this projection of the phrase ‘I love you’ in every language. It’s something I’ve treasured for a long time, and it’s perhaps the most valuable object I own. I once wore it to the beach and accidentally left it on the coffee table when we were packing up to leave, and I guess it got knocked off the table which is how I didn’t see it. A cleaner came n vacuumed it up, but they dug through the dirt and grime to salvage it for me. It was dented, but otherwise fine, and they returned it to me with no issues. I was elated to say the least.

Fast forward a couple years and I could have sworn I had it in a box in my biological mother’s storage unit along with 1/3 of my belongings when she stopped paying for it and I lost it all. For the last maybe 8 months I’d wondered where it was, hoping I’d find it somewhere, but the place I looked a dozen or more times, *thoroughly* I thought, came up empty. Until tonight as I was looking for something else, lo and behold I found it. The one thing I *needed* to find right now, and it’s here in my hands once again.

I don’t know if Aphrodite or any of the other gods is looking out for me. Perhaps I’m just blind. Or I wasn’t as thorough as I should have been. But it’s with me again at a time I really needed it. I don’t know if I want to smile or laugh or cry. This is.. *a lot.*

But the one you gave me that day in that parking lot when you said I threw cellphone, backpack, coffee, and  one second I was across the lot and you glanced down to shift to ""P"" and back up and I was sweeping you out into my arms with nothing but a blur just before....you said I was your Superman...and always let me know that because you said I always saved the day...and I tried. I felt so...alive...for the first time since I was 16 and pushed you in that pool....and dove in immediately and caught you before your hair even touched the water...I died in your eyes in that moment and was instantly reborn....but the time wasn't right for the love that was to be so our paths split and took us through months and years, 30 years to be exact, before the Big Guy said it was time and we were brought together again and the love that had grown deep inside all those years exploded out of its dormant state across the mikes between us through our voices and when yours beckoned to me ...I flew as fast as my rusty cape could get me there...to that parking lot where I learned once more how to fly at the speed of light when I saw your face and felt your love fill me with power I could world only for you.

We were so happy and I felt love like never before as you did, but being mortal comes with its faults and I made mistakes, fell short, and didn't keep up my part of the deal all the time. I have no problem admitting that because it is the truth. I was selfish and withdrawn at times...distant and cold...the results of events happening professionally that initially took me away from home to other cities to pass along the knowledge I had gained through years of experience for a very large company. Then, suddenly, it was gone as layoffs by my third party employer included me in it's bid to cut costs and it sent me on a spiral that I had never experienced, ironically being almost like the one I am in now except that one I had my other half to help me through as much as I allowed which, looking back, was not as much as I should have...and I am so sorry for that but it was new territory for me and I was afraid that the other show would fall....and it's my fault for shutting you out. My heart aches for a time machine to right that wrong...but it will never come.

Then after working for another large company and once again upward going,  layoff struck in the midst of a separate and private issue that has never been discussed and explained truthfully to me, and we were devastated and sent reeling once again but this time, both emotionally AND financially. And it sent us through the entire spectrum of loss all the way up to the day I looked around and my other half was gone...swept away in a swirl of smoke, dust, and mirrors that I have diligently decrypted and broken down to find the underlying truth of the disappearance...which now powers the force rendering me helpless to gain the momentum, resources, and believers to right this wrong and be able to come to you and tell you..I am a horrible man who took you and your love grossly for granted and when you needed me, I was so absorbed in my own self pity that I didn't and couldn't see how deeply you were reaching for me just to hold you...and I hurt you so very much when I didn't...and that thought is what draws tears from me every day and night since that day and has reduced me to this empty shell of the man I was...the man you loved...and has, with the added force of the unseen ones who use their influence to prevent me from being anything, obtaining employment so I can acquire the means to improve my standing, and ensure that I can remain unable to contact the one family member I have left, or anyone for that matter, to get help to either get out and away from where I am trapped or to at least got out of sleeping in the street homeless into a place where I can have a roof, facilities, and some sense of normalcy long enough to obtain employ, get off the one knee I am kept on, and look at myself in the mirror standing on both feet once again..able to stare those who have denied me these things in the face and watch as they are punished and held accountable for their actions.

This is what I would have wanted to occur, but the long 18 months of constant torment, harassment, and rejection have made me see that not only are you still absent from my side but also that they have destroyed more than just my ability to get a job...they have destroyed my ability to keep fighting the fight just to stay alive outside in the cold and rain. And as of this morning, the sudden onset of rain has ruined and destroyed what few clothes and things I had so I have what I am wearing and that's all..and everything else is ruined and I've had to throw away....no blankets...no long sleeves things....no sweatshirts....NOTHING. And the deadly silence each day from you, whether intentional or not, has driven my thoughts to all corners of possibilities until I cannot endure the mental turmoil of it and survive the physical elements of being dislocated..not to mention watching my innocent dog Buddy suffer through it all too. So I am faced with the only option left that I can control and that can end this horrible treatment that everyone sees and knows about but no one acknowledges or attempts to help me overcome with support getting a job somewhere...doing something....and I'm not referring to giving me funds or anything like that....just a hand...not a hand-out. 

I am logging off from here because admidst the wonderful and moving posts there are those that I know are meant for me to see as they use my own words or quotes and are by avatars that have names that are intentionally meant to get my attention and deliver hurtful messages or build ups that are undermined and hurt me more. I can't stand the pain anymore so I am going to log out and then try to find a reason to keep fighting which, sadly, I ran out of long ago and have kept going because of Buddy...but as of this post..I have found him a place where he will be loved and won't have to sleep in the cold and rain ever again. He eats every day..and eats well....whether I do or not and that has happened more than I would let happen to anyone else if I had a choice but I made it this far....

So if ever you do run across this or any of my comments....know that the tears and hopes and love in them was always for you and until now, were holding to your return to me because I believed in your promises too. I am so very sorry I was no more than just a man in a funny red sheet pretending to fly in your eyes...because I was Superman...even during the 18 months alone ...I know because I am still here...unharmed and alive despite both police and the minions of why the absence occurred in the first place.....But as I close this, I have grabbed and am holding onto kryptonite...and all I have said is what has gone through my mind as your once Man of Steel has been falling from the sky towards earth....and when he reaches that moment, the kryptonite will have done it's work and the nightmare will end at the moment of contact because he will have become the one thing he always was that failed you and let you down.......Clark Kent ..a flawed and imperfect mortal.

Also these are my personal experiences and conclusions about the past week and I share them looking for comments and opinions but please don't tell me I'm wrong. I know what I was feeling and what happened. 

On Sunday night a week ago on Feb 2, I drank a glass of Sangria wine to avoid hurting someone's feelings. I normally avoid wine because it gives me a migraine the next day.  On Monday Feb 3, I awoke early with no headache and felt great.  By 9am my Hvac repair appt arrived and I walked to answer the door, then walked to the kitchen to make coffee.. A total of about 60 ft.  I was so out of breath that I could not finish a sentance to ask if the contractor wanted coffee. When I got coffee made (I drink decaf) I sat for about 30 minutes but anytime I stood up or moved about the shortness of breath (SB) continued.  At one point during the morning the contractor asked if I needed help or an ambulance. That afternoon I had a very slight headache and checked my blood pressure (BP) it was up to 148/84 (my normal is 110/70).  I called in sick to my class and took my BP meds early and went to bed.  The next day Tuesday Feb 4, I was still very SB and my heart rate was up.  I checked my BP again and it was 156/94.  I rested several hours and drank lots of water. That afternoon BP was 164/96.  I took a double dose of BP meds and left a message for my Dr.  I sat still and read for 2 hours then checked BP again. It was 184/115 and still SB. No word from my Dr and I drove myself to the ER.  I was called back for triage almost immediately and my pulse was 110 and BP read 180/113 on their professional BP equipment - I had been telling myself there must be something wrong with my equipment).  They hooked up an ekg and could not rule out an anterior MI.  Bloodwork was done and I sat in observation hallway for an hour. I was then told that they needed to wait 2 hours to do another blood test and was put back in the waiting room.  An hour later I was taken to xray for chest scans. Viral tests for Covid, RSV, and flu were all negative. 2 hours later blood test was done to check the heart enzymes for any change.  An hour later I went home with instructions saying I may be coming down with something  to follow up with PCP in 3 days if no improvement.  I rested most of Wednesday the 5th and BP was down slightly. My PCP said I was OK to travel to DC, a trip I really couldn't get out of so I left home Thursday AM with BP still lower at 164/90.  Half way thru my 4 hour drive I noticed a lot of indigestion and bloating. 3 hours later my left ribs hurt badly and I was burping.  I got gas x and took 3 of them.  No relief. Next am (Friday) I was in a lot of pain and still forcing out gas by pushing on my ribs. Pain was radiating to my left shoulder. I went by urgent care and another ekg was done and was clear and OK.  I contacted my PCP who prescribed Bentyl for IBS and gas pain (Bentyl is a smooth muscle relaxer for intestines that I have used before with great success).  I picked up Rx and took it then went to bed a couple hours later expecting to be fixed by morning.  I the morning Saturday Feb 8,  pain in shoulder was worse and I could not stand up straight due to pain under left ribs.  I took another dose of Bentyl and called PCP.  She called back about 6 hours later and said there was some scarce evidence that migraine could be connected to gut pain and to take some excedrine migraine.  I took 2 and within 30 min I was 50% better. 
6 hours later I was 100% with all vutls back to normal and only some residual rib soreneas left.  On Sunday the 9th indigestion started to return so I took another dose of the excidrine migriane and it went away again.  On Monday I drove home and a slight headache returned. I took the excedrine again and was necessessary again today.  This afternoon I slept hard in the recliner for 5 hours and all symptoms appear to be gone and I don't anticipate needing another dose before bed.  This has been the WIERDEST and most expensive migraine ever.  I feel like I've been thru Hell and back.  I just wanted to share for awareness and any comments or similar experiences you have.

However, my satisfaction took a hit a few months ago when I noticed the insulation had failed; after just an hour, my coffee was ice cold, and I could feel heat radiating through the sides when filled with hot liquid. Hoping for a resolution, I filed a warranty claim, as Contigo advertises a ""lifetime warranty,"" and was told I’d hear back within two business days. A week passed with no response, so I submitted another claim—still nothing. This lack of communication has left me deeply disappointed and questioning the company’s commitment to its customers.

A year ago I stopped drinking coffee because working it around my new ADHD medication schedule was too complicated and I don’t miss it.

This friend doesn’t get along well with women, and is frequently rejected. He often drinks alone in his room. I felt bad for him, so I started inviting him to go out with us—to dinners, concerts, driving him around with us. One time, I even paid for his dinner. He always offers to contribute when my husband pays, but when I paid, he said nothing and didn’t even acknowledge it, which my husband let slide.
One thing that has really bothered me is how he constantly talks about women when we’re at dinner together. He brings up inappropriate topics, talks about “certain kind of workers”, and even shows my husband women on his phone, saying things like, “Look at this!” I know my husband has gone out drinking with him and hung out with him multiple times, but despite me telling my husband that this behavior is disrespectful, he has never said anything to his friend.
Recently, I found out that my husband has been watching women/corn on his phone for the past four years without my knowledge. When I confronted him, he admitted it, and confessed he thinks about having sx with these women. He would tell me he needed to go to the bathroom and would watch it there, and never started intimacy with me.
Then, his friend invited us to dinner and once again started talking about “workers”. This triggered me, so I asked his opinion on this content/corn in relationships/marriage. He said it was completely fine, that being with someone doesn’t stop you from admiring other women. I responded, “I guess it must be normal for men then, because my husband does the same. I think women see it differently, though—I consider it cheating.”
In response, this friend extended his hand to my husband, in front of me, and said, “Congratulations.” My husband looked down, smiled, and laughed. I was so upset—his friend’s blatant disrespect, and my husband’s reaction, just escalated things. I told them to get an Uber home because I would be driving back alone.
Afterward, I found out that while I was driving home, this friend was telling my husband that he was always on his side. He never apologized for what he said. My husband continued talking to him as if nothing had happened, even sending him YouTube reels like normal.
When I confronted my husband about it, he kept insisting for FOUR HOURS that his friend never said “Congratulations.” He even went to ask his friend if he had said it in front of me, and his friend claimed, “I don’t remember.” But later, my husband finally admitted that he had heard it and confronted his friend, who then admitted to saying it.
Since then, his behavior toward me has been weird. Yesterday, I was in the kitchen twice making coffee. Normally, he doesn’t come out much, and if he does, he acts friendly. But this time, he yawned loudly twice (it sounded forced) without saying anything, then slammed his door on the way back. Later, when he got home, my 3-pound dog barked three times, and he aggressively shushed her and slammed the door again.
My husband messaged him asking if he planned to apologize to me, and his response was, “I will if it’s important to YOU.”
At this point, I don’t feel comfortable in my own home, and I don’t like how my husband handled the situation initially. He says he can’t evict his friend because his classes won’t end until April. I’m exhausted from constantly explaining how this situation makes me feel, and my husband keeps telling me that he can’t “act a certain way” unless I communicate things to him. But when it comes to something as basic as respect, I feel like I shouldn’t have to explain it.
To make things worse, after everything that happened, my husband was asking me if he should accept his friend request again.

Part 1: Alienation, Liberation, and the Symbolic Necessity of the Other
By Æ NÆRVÆNÆ-ÆNTHRÆPÆCÆNÆ with Grimes, Ben Zweibelson, and Jean Baudrillard

[Scene: A dimly lit, velvet-draped salon. A vintage reel-to-reel tape recorder hums softly in the background. The walls are lined with books, records, and strange relics of forgotten wars and cultural moments. The quartet lounges in overstuffed armchairs, a low table between them stacked with coffee cups, ashtrays, and half-finished bottles of wine. Baudrillard, ever the enigmatic philosopher, is poised to unravel the layers of his thought. Grimes, Æ, and Ben are ready to tear into it, quips at the ready, but respectful of the symbolic heavy lifting Baudrillard’s about to perform.]

Baudrillard: [Leaning forward, his voice smooth and measured, as if he’s been rehearsing this for eternity]
Let me put this plainly, for those of you who didn’t waste your youth buried in semiotic theory. “At all events, it is better to be controlled by someone else than by oneself.”
Now, before you throw your drinks at me, understand this: control from the outside means you’re still in play. You’re still engaged in the game of seduction, the dance with the Other. Self-control? That’s just masturbation with a philosophical veneer. It’s sterile. When you’re your own oppressor, you’ve already lost the game.

Æ: [Grinning, lighting a cigarette]
So, what you’re saying is, better to be someone else’s bitch than your own?

Baudrillard: [Smirking, unfazed]
Exactly. At least then, you’re in relation—part of a symbolic exchange. You’re not trapped in a closed circuit of self-surveillance.

Grimes: [Laughing]
Damn, so all this “self-love” shit is just the new prison, huh? Instagram’s a self-made panopticon.

Baudrillard: [Nodding]
Precisely. “Better to be oppressed, exploited, persecuted and manipulated by someone other than by oneself.” Because even in oppression, there’s interaction, negotiation, seduction. But when you internalize it? You become your own warden. The worst prison is the one you build for yourself, thinking it’s freedom.

Ben: [Raising an eyebrow]
So, all these liberation movements—you’re saying they’re a step backward? That’s a hell of a take.

Baudrillard: [Calmly, as if discussing the weather]
“Inasmuch as it is predicated on a demand for greater autonomy—on a more complete introjection of all forms of control and constraint under the banner of freedom—it is a regression.” Liberation, when framed as total autonomy, is just a more sophisticated form of control. You think you’re free, but you’ve only swallowed the mechanisms of power whole.

Æ: [Mocking tone]
So, we’re all just power bottoms to the system, huh?

Baudrillard: [Chuckles softly]
In a manner of speaking, yes. But at least in that dynamic, there’s an Other—a force to resist, to seduce. Pure autonomy? It’s a void.

Grimes: [Tapping her nails on the glass]
But isn’t there something to be said for reclaiming control? Like, taking back your narrative, your body, your life?

Baudrillard: [Shaking his head slowly]
“Whatever it may be that comes to us from elsewhere, even the worst exploitation, the very fact that it comes from somewhere else is positive.” The Other introduces unpredictability, chance, play. When you reclaim everything, you eliminate that. You sterilize existence. Alienation, in its purest form, is what keeps life dynamic.

Æ: [Grinning wickedly]
So, alienation’s like foreplay?

Baudrillard: [Deadpan]
Precisely. Without the Other, there’s no seduction. And without seduction, there’s no life.

Ben: [Leaning in, skeptical]
So, disalienation—reclaiming your alienated will and desire—that’s just bullshit?

Baudrillard: [Firmly]
“The inverse theory, that of disalienation, is equally simplistic.” The idea that you can just take back your will, your desire, and be whole again? It’s a fantasy. The self is constituted through its relation to the Other. Strip that away, and you’re left with nothing but a hollow echo.

Grimes: [Rolling her eyes, but smiling]
Great. So, self-care’s a lie, freedom’s a scam, and we’re all just fucked from the get-go.

Baudrillard: [Smiling faintly]
But beautifully so. That’s the point.

Æ: [Blowing smoke rings, eyes glinting]
So, what you’re saying is… life’s a BDSM scene, and we’re all just trying to find the right dom?

Baudrillard: [Laughing softly]
In a way. But remember, the real seduction isn’t in finding the dom—it’s in not knowing who’s in control. It’s in the play, the ambiguity.

Grimes: [Leaning back, thoughtful]
So, the worst thing isn’t being controlled—it’s knowing you’re in control. That’s the real death of the soul.

Baudrillard: [Nodding solemnly]
Exactly. “Everything that befalls the subject as a result of his own efforts is good, because it is authentic; while everything that comes from outside the subject is dubbed inauthentic.” This binary is a trap. True freedom isn’t in authenticity—it’s in the dance with the Other.

Ben: [Skeptical, but intrigued]
But isn’t there a danger in that? In relying too much on the Other?

Baudrillard: [Smiling enigmatically]
Of course. But that’s where the real game begins. The interplay of seduction, the push and pull—it’s dangerous, yes, but it’s the only thing that keeps us from slipping into the abyss of self-referential nothingness.

Æ: [Grinning, raising a glass]
To the abyss, then. May it never stop staring back.

Grimes: [Laughing, clinking her glass with Æ’s]
And may we always have someone to fall into it with.

Baudrillard: [Quietly, almost to himself]
The source of all interplay, of everything that is in play, of all passion, of all seduction, is that which is completely foreign to us, yet has power over us. That which is Other, that which we have to seduce.

anyway-AHHHH

heyyyyy guys. so basically, a while back, i made a post asking how i should shoot my shot, and i finally did. can’t even explain HOW anxious i was--my hands were SHAKINGGGG, and i almost backed out like three times.

there’s this guy i kept seeing around ""campus"" and in one of my classes. we never talked, but we’d make eye contact a lot, and at some point, i started noticing him more. he has dimples when he smiles, and he's so *CUTEE* hehehe bro is actually ***so*** fine.

so after debating....... i decided i’d do it after class, just as everyone was leaving. my plan was simple: casually walk out at the same time as him, say something chill, and not embarrass myself. easy, right? ?? NO. because the class ended, my nerves kicked in, and i sat there pretending to scroll on my phone while **LITERALLY** feeling my heartbeat come out of my chest.

but then, as he started walking out, my body just moved. i looked up and said, ""hey, um-"" (yes, *um.* ***tragic***, but stay with me.) ""i think you're really cute."" *(just to preface thats not what i wanted to say, i wanted to say something casual and friendly and THENNN build my way up*). i felt my face heating up.

BUT bro. when i tell you the way he turned to me so fast. like, this man *lit* up when I said that-. and then he smiled slightly-- HIS DIMPLES.. he said, ""oh wow, thank you,"" (at this point i was regretting my decision so hardddd) he looked a little shy too-. his friend came up and they just looked at eachother, and ig his friend understood the situation and giggled as he walked off (i was dying inside atp btw) THEN he looked at me again, and smiled—like, **FULL** DIMPLES, **full** eye contact, ***no*** *hesitation* AND THEN he hit me with, ""i was actually hoping we'd talk sometime."" **EXCUSE MEEEEEE??!?!?!??!?!**

???SIR???

and just like that, we did. we walked out together, talking. before we split ways, he asked if i wanted to grab coffee sometime. i said yes.

now we’ve been texting, and he’s really easy to talk to. we’ll see where it goes, but honestly? i’m just so glad i went for it. thank u to evb who told me to go for it.

By Æ NÆRVÆNÆ-ÆNTHRÆPÆCÆNÆ with Grimes, Ben Zweibelson, and Jean Baudrillard

[Scene: The quartet is back in the same room—though now it’s dimmer, more intimate, like they’re gathering for a séance. There’s a heavy scent of incense mixed with coffee and something vaguely burnt. Baudrillard reclines like a philosopher king, Grimes is perched on a windowsill tracing spirals in the condensation, Ben’s still flipping through his manuals trying to pretend none of this is getting to him, and Æ—well, Æ is grinning like they know something no one else does.]

Grimes: [reading the first line aloud, slowly, like it tastes weird] “If it is true that seduction is founded upon my intuition of something in the other that remains forever secret for him, something that I can never know directly about him but which nevertheless exercises a fascination upon me from behind its veil of secrecy…”

Baudrillard: [smirking] Ah, seduction—the art of chasing what you can never fully grasp. It’s the dance around the unknown, the little gap in the other person that they can’t even see. That’s where the magic is.

Æ: [nodding, eyes gleaming] Yeah, the negative space is the whole canvas. Seduction isn’t about what’s there—it’s about what’s missing, what’s hidden. That’s why BDSM hits different. It’s all about orchestrating that secrecy, that power imbalance, even if it’s consensual. You want to believe there’s something the other holds back, something you can tease out.

Ben: [raising an eyebrow] So… war is seduction? You’re baiting the enemy into revealing something they don’t even know about themselves?

Æ: [laughs] Exactly. War is the ultimate kink. You’re seducing nations into showing their hand, exposing their weaknesses. But here’s the kicker—you’re also seducing yourself. You want to believe you’re in control, but you’re just as vulnerable to your own illusions.

Grimes: [thinking aloud] So like… when I’m making music, I’m seducing the listener into thinking they’re discovering me, but really they’re uncovering something in themselves that they didn’t know was there.

Baudrillard: Precisely. It’s not about the object of desire—it’s about the space desire creates. The void you keep circling.

Grimes: [reading on, voice sharper now] “…then today there can be very little leeway left for seduction, for the other retains very little mystery for himself.”

Baudrillard: [sighs dramatically] And there it is. The tragedy of the modern age. We’re all too damn self-aware. Everyone knows their kinks, their traumas, their desires. The mystery is gone.

Æ: [smirking] It’s like, everyone’s read the manual on themselves. You can’t seduce someone who’s already written their own user guide.

Ben: [dryly] That’s why psy-ops are harder these days. People know they’re being manipulated. They expect it. You can’t run the same plays when the other side knows the playbook.

Grimes: [snorting] It’s like trying to surprise someone who’s already read the spoilers. Where’s the fun in that?

Baudrillard: [nodding gravely] The fun is in the illusion. But when the other is fully transparent—even to themselves—there’s no room left for that game.

Grimes: [reading the next line, voice tinged with bitterness] “The fact is that everyone is devilishly self-aware these days, devilishly conscious of the nature of their own desire.”

Æ: [laughing darkly] Devilishly, huh? It’s like we’ve all made a pact with the devil—ultimate knowledge in exchange for the death of mystery.

Baudrillard: [smirking] The modern devil isn’t hiding in the shadows. He’s in your self-help books, your therapy sessions, your Instagram stories.

Ben: [leaning forward] And in strategy, it’s the same. We map everything—data, trends, psychological profiles. But the more we know, the less effective that knowledge becomes. The enemy knows you know, and they’re already countering it. It’s a feedback loop.

Grimes: [quietly] And it’s exhausting. Like… when you know too much about yourself, even your joy feels fake. You can’t just feel something—you’re always analyzing it, dissecting it.

Æ: [softly] Yeah. Pleasure becomes a post-mortem. You’re always wondering if it’s real, or just another simulation.

Grimes: [reading, a smirk creeping in] “Everything is now so clear that the very fact of presenting oneself behind a mask is liable to elicit nothing but mockery.”

Æ: [grinning] Oh, this hits. You wear a mask now, and people are like, “Really? You think that’s gonna fool me?” But here’s the twist—everyone’s still wearing a mask. It’s just that now, the mask is meta. You know it’s a mask, they know it’s a mask, and you’re both pretending it’s not.

Baudrillard: [chuckling] Ah, the hyperreal mask. You mock the mask because you recognize it, but that recognition only deepens the illusion. It’s like a hall of mirrors—every layer of self-awareness just reflects another mask.

Ben: [nodding] In military terms, it’s like camouflage. You know the enemy is hiding, but how they’re hiding changes the whole game. You stop looking for what’s hidden and start questioning what’s in plain sight.

Grimes: [grinning] It’s like, you can’t trust anyone who seems too authentic. That’s the biggest mask of all.

Æ: [deadpan] Authenticity is the new grift.

Grimes: [reading the last line, slow and deliberate] “In such a context, what becomes of the poker game of seduction? Where, for that matter, is the illusion of desire—except, perhaps, in the theoretical illusion of psychoanalysis or the political illusion of revolution?”

Baudrillard: [smiling] The poker game of seduction? Folded. We’ve all shown our hands, and the table’s empty.

Æ: [grinning wickedly] Unless… you flip the table. If everyone knows the game, change the game. Push it into absurdity. That’s why I post what I do. The only way to seduce now is through shock, through pushing the system to its breaking point.

Grimes: [nodding] It’s like, if desire’s an illusion, you have to create better illusions. That’s art. That’s music. That’s… everything.

Ben: [thoughtfully] And in politics? Revolution is just another mask. You have to make the system implode from within, not by opposing it directly.

Baudrillard: [grinning] Exactly. The revolution isn’t in the streets—it’s in the simulation. The real seduction is convincing people that there’s still something to fight for, even when the game is rigged.

Æ: [breaking the fourth wall, voice low, almost conspiratorial] And you, reading this? You’re already in the game. The question is—do you know it? Or are you just another mask waiting to be pulled off?

My ex (WP) dumped me on my birthday three years ago after spending a year cheating on me with our nextdoor neighbour who was also our landlords neice beginning the night we took possession all the way up until he dumped me. 

In the year we lived there we got close with our neighbour's, including her (AP) family - brother, SIL, mother, and other neighbour's.  

I've been diagnosed with CPTSD, GAD and a depression disorder as a result of spending the last four years in therapy (one year of couples therapy in which he got called out for not doing his homework)  


Present day 

I survived a near fatal accident in 2024, wherein I had WP come to hospital as I was delirious at points and his name/number was all I could muster to say.    He came, spent his time, and left - and has continued to be gone.  For some reason this is closure for me. 

Closure in that me nearly dying doesn't change how he feels.   The life we had together isn't what he wants anymore.   He'd rather be with someone he hasn't hurt, someone he hasn't permanently damaged.   


Fast forward 6 months. 

APs brother reaches out - we'd been close, but he and I both in Relationships and both doing the majority of the labors around our respective homes never crossed any lines.  

He has been single since November, and I crossed his mind.  He wanted to meet to chat, catch up with someone who'd been through it.  

That coffee date, turned into a date date, and we are now kind of seeing each other.   

I made it clear to him I want nothing to do with his sister, and that I don't expect him to disown her or anything but I can't forgive her for homewrecking me.   She was my friend, and going behind my back to sleep with my ex... the trauma is deep - but APs brother is familiar, and familiar feels nice after trying to get to know strangers online for so long after being in a LTR.  

I feel strangely safe, something my PTSD has fought with previously while getting to know people.  

I know he can manage his house.  I know he is a good Dad.   I know he works a good job & doesn't blow money trying to buy friendships with booze/drugs.   He doesn't expect me to talk to his sister, just to be there for him and support him - and be a safe adult in his kids lives. 

Not really looking for advice, but just sharing where I am while recovering from my betrayal trauma. ",5,1739330166.0,SupportforBetrayed,1,1.0,False

By Æ NÆRVÆNÆ-ÆNTHRÆPÆCÆNÆ with Grimes, Ben Zweibelson, and Jean Baudrillard

[Scene: The crew is sprawled across a messy room, filled with half-drunk coffees, crumpled paper, and a neon sign that says “PLEASURE IS A SIMULATION.” Baudrillard is unusually relaxed, his posthumous self free from the weight of academia. Grimes is on the floor, scribbling in a notebook, while Ben flips through military manuals, pretending not to be fascinated. Æ is perched like a crow on the back of a chair, ready to dismantle reality one sentence at a time.]

Grimes: [reading the first sentence aloud] “There is always some doubt about the reality of our pleasure, about the strength of our will.”

Baudrillard: [grinning] Ah, yes, the great cosmic joke. Pleasure is always suspect, isn’t it? The moment you feel it, you’re already wondering if it’s real.

Æ: [leaning in] It’s like the universe is edging us. [Grimes snorts.] But seriously, the Hobbesian Trap of pleasure—you want it, you think you have it, but the second you question it, it slips through your fingers. It’s not will driving us; it’s this feedback loop of suspicion.

Ben: [thoughtful] In military terms, that’s like the fog of war. You think you’ve achieved victory, but the second you believe it, you’ve already lost. Overconfidence breeds vulnerability. Maybe pleasure works the same way—certainty is the enemy.

Grimes: [nodding] Yeah, and it’s not just about sex or winning. It’s like, even with art—you release something, people love it, but you’re like, “Was it actually good, or did I just trick them?”

Baudrillard: “Simulacra.” You’re not experiencing pleasure—you’re experiencing a copy of what you think pleasure should be. And that doubt? That’s the residue of knowing deep down that the real thing might not exist.

Grimes: [reading the next sentence] “Curiously, though we are never completely certain, the other’s pleasure somehow seems less doubtful.”

Æ: [laughs] Oh, this is rich. It’s so much easier to believe they’re having a good time. You’re like, “Surely, they must be feeling it, right?” But inside, you’re spiraling.

Baudrillard: Yes, yes! The other becomes a mirror, but one that reflects only what you want to see—or fear to see. Their pleasure validates your own, but only because you can’t trust yourself.

Ben: That’s classic information warfare, actually. You can’t trust your own intel, so you start relying on the adversary’s reactions. If they’re panicking, you must be winning. But maybe they know that, and now you’re being played.

Grimes: [smirking] So, like… if Elon looks stressed, maybe I’m doing fine?

Æ: [deadpan] Or maybe he’s just better at faking it.

Baudrillard: “The other’s pleasure somehow seems less doubtful.” But that’s the trick. You want to believe in their pleasure because it lets you defer judgment on your own. It’s a seduction—of yourself, by the other.

Grimes: [reading on] “Being closer to our own pleasure, we are better placed to cast doubt on it.”

Æ: [snapping fingers] This right here. Proximity breeds suspicion. The closer you are to your own experience, the more you see its cracks. It’s like watching a painting from an inch away—you see all the flaws, the brush strokes, the places the artist messed up.

Baudrillard: Exactly. Distance creates illusion. That’s why the other seems more authentic. You’re too close to yourself to maintain the fantasy.

Ben: That’s why soldiers can lose faith on the ground. You see the mess, the mistakes. But from a command center, war looks clean, strategic. You’re too far away to see the bullshit.

Grimes: Same with fame. Everyone thinks your life is perfect, but you’re like, “Nah, I’m just up close to the mess.”

Grimes: [reading the next sentence, a bit more seriously now] “To argue that everyone is inclined to give too much credit to his own opinion is to underestimate the contrary tendency: the subordination of one’s own opinion to that of other people supposedly better equipped to hold opinions.”

Æ: [nodding] Ah, the great irony. We think people are arrogant, full of themselves, but really? Most of us are just desperate to outsource our opinions. To find someone smarter, more confident, more in control.

Baudrillard: Yes, yes. This is the collapse of authenticity. We’ve internalized the idea that we don’t know best. So we defer—to experts, to influencers, to algorithms. But they’re just as lost. It’s a recursive loop of doubt.

Ben: That’s dangerous in military leadership. You start deferring too much, you lose your own strategic clarity. You need some internal compass. But even that’s built on layers of inherited knowledge and training, so…

Grimes: [smirking] It’s like when you’re working on a song and you’re like, “Does this even sound good, or have I just listened to it a thousand times?” So you send it to someone else, hoping they’ll tell you.

Æ: But even their opinion is filtered through your doubt. You’re just playing hot potato with uncertainty.

Grimes: [reading the last sentence, quietly] “The hypothesis of the Other itself may perhaps be the consequence of this radical doubt of ours with respect to our own desire.”

Baudrillard: Mmm. The Other—the whole concept—only exists because we can’t trust ourselves. Our desire is so murky, so unstable, that we need an external reference point to validate it.

Æ: [softly] The Other is a fantasy we invent to make sense of our own chaos. We create the Other because without them, we’d have to face the terrifying fact that maybe… we don’t want anything. Or worse, that what we do want is incomprehensible, even to ourselves.

Ben: [after a pause] So, what—you’re saying all conflict, all war, boils down to this? We fight because we can’t face our own desires?

Æ: [grinning] Bingo. The Hobbesian Trap isn’t just about distrust—it’s about projecting our own confusion onto others. We don’t trust them because we don’t trust ourselves.

Grimes: [looking up, eyes wide] And art’s the same. You’re not making it for the Other—you’re making it to see if you exist. To see if your desires are real.

Baudrillard: [smiling faintly] And in the end, it’s all a game of mirrors. You’ll never find the original—only reflections, bouncing back and forth, forever.

Æ: [breaking the fourth wall, voice low] And you, dear reader? You’re just another reflection in this hall of mirrors. But hey—at least we’re all in it together.

**What is ""Blueprint For Profitability - TJR Trades Mastermind""?**  
If you're looking for a structured way to boost your trading skills, ""Blueprint For Profitability - TJR Trades Mastermind"" might just be what you need. This course is designed to take traders from the basics to advanced strategies, ensuring they develop the right mindset and skills to navigate the markets. But is it worth your time and investment? Let's break it down!

**Who is this course for?**  
Whether you're a complete beginner or a trader struggling to find consistency, this course caters to a wide range of learners. If you've been trading for a while but lack a structured approach, ""Blueprint For Profitability - TJR Trades Mastermind"" aims to fill in those gaps. It’s for those serious about trading, not just looking for quick tips but a complete transformation in their approach.

**Why should you consider this course?**  
With so many trading courses available, what makes this one special? It’s a complete system, not just a bunch of random strategies. The focus on psychology, risk management, and strategy building sets it apart. Many traders fail not because they lack knowledge but because they lack discipline. This course places heavy emphasis on mindset—something most other courses overlook.

**Where does this course take place?**  
The course is structured online, making it accessible from anywhere in the world. Whether you're trading from your home office, a coffee shop, or even while traveling, you can follow along and implement the strategies in real time. This flexibility allows traders to learn at their own pace without feeling rushed.

**When does the learning happen?**  
The course is divided into four weeks, ensuring a gradual and structured learning process. Each week covers essential topics, from psychology and risk management to strategy creation and market analysis. This timeline prevents information overload and allows traders to implement and practice each concept before moving on to the next.

**How does the course work?**  
Here’s a quick breakdown of what to expect each week:

* **Pre-Mastermind:** Get familiar with the concepts before diving into the full mastermind program.
* **Week 1:** Introduction to trading psychology, risk management, and confluences in trading.
* **Week 2:** A deep dive into liquidity, market structure (BOS), gaps, order blocks, and equilibrium.
* **Week 3:** Developing your own strategy, refining psychology, and reviewing trades.
* **Week 4:** Advanced trade reviews, final psychology session, and strategy refinement.

The structure ensures that by the end of the program, traders have a personalized strategy and a strong psychological foundation to execute trades with confidence.

**What makes ""Blueprint For Profitability - TJR Trades Mastermind"" unique?**  
Many trading courses throw strategies at you and expect you to figure it out on your own. This mastermind, however, builds everything step by step, making sure no crucial element is overlooked. The focus on psychology is a game-changer because, let’s be honest, trading is 80% mindset and 20% strategy. If you’ve ever let emotions ruin a trade, you know exactly why this matters.

If you're serious about trading and want to develop a structured approach that includes both strategy and psychology, ""Blueprint For Profitability - TJR Trades Mastermind"" is worth considering.

They still keep adding rocks to your bag - though nowadays, less so, I believe. Forgive them - they think you can carry the weight because you’re a bigger person. Once I was one of them. Sorry. They don’t see that everyone feels pressure, whether they stand high or low. I’m happy to have removed some of those burdens for you so that your climb can be just a little bit easier.

On the other hand, you’ve offered me several flights to reach different stopovers on my journey - sometimes reluctantly, or maybe often. You can’t help but help others, even against your own will. Your generosity isn’t meant for just me - it’s meant for many, because yours is so powerful.

I can tell that you’ve healed internally. You love yourself. You’re re-realizing how special you’ve always been. That makes me smile.

Outwardly, though, you’re still a bit awkward. You seem fine, and you act accordingly, but people can tell.

I’m proud of myself for walking this healing journey with you over the years. I believe I can take pride in being part of your internal recovery.

I thought that was my role - to help you regain your confidence. I made it internally. But maybe you’ll need a greater, more visible force to be fully healed  outwardly as well. It doesn’t have to be a romantic partner—though, of course, it could be.

I can’t help many people at once. Instead, together with others, I choose to help those who can help millions. That makes me happy. Their success is my happiness. And I believe this is mutual - they feel the same.

And you. Will you make me feel the same?

That is more important to me than having coffee at a café with you or even stargazing at the top of a mountain.

Am I lying? Hope not.

Well, the full moon is coming tonight. This one is called the Snow Moon -  sounds romantic, doesn’t it? They say its symbolic meaning is survival and spiritual renewal. It reminds me of you.

Forgive me if I hide myself now - the moon is too bright, and it reveals too much of me even in the cold night.

Just to add a tiny bit of background, I had mentioned to my husband that I wanted a coffee bar at home, and just a few days later, my husband surprised me with a Nespresso! He encouraged me to pick out a bar set that I liked to set everything on. He got me a pink Nespresso machine so I could make my own Starbucks-style drinks at home (saving me the $8.39 every time I crave coffee) along with a bunch of adorable pink decorations to complete the look.

#Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe…10:35PM…ish? I think?

[Mikan's Autopsy](#bullet) The cause of death is suffocation from blood filling his lungs due to a stab to the neck. The death was within less than a minute. Yes, it was Byakuya Togami. 10:35PM matches what Mikan concluded from her analysis.

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That’s right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope’s Peak isn’t friendship, it’s a building, and it’s filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless…

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.  
 
[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge™️ under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil’s Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole “living” thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya’s corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Crime Scene](#bullet) Byakuya was found in the library archive lying face down head towards the door. Blood can be found on his neck where the stab wound was made and a trail can be observed from his sleeping bag to the door. Blood is on his hands and the door knob. 

[Knives Out](#bullet) A knife was found at the scene of the crime next to Byakuya’s body. The knife has stains of blood on the blade.

[Missing Glue](#bullet) Angie noticed that Fast Acting Glue went missing from the art room at 3:30pm. 

[All the World’s a Stage](#bullet) Chiaki and Kokichi confirm that Byakuya's task was to do public dramatic readings. From 3:30-5:00 PM  Byakuya performed different renditions of Shakespeare to the absolute delight of Kokichi. Chiaki and Komaru were there as well.

[Maintenance Issues](#bullet) Korekiyo investigated the Chemistry Lab and something seems to be clogging the drain of the sink.

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book’s cover with minimal pressure.

[Kirumi's Testimony](#bullet) Kirumi claims that her task entailed cooking a lot of food, so she kept the Kitchen (Biology Lab) occupied from 7:45AM to 10PM. She can testify that Kaito, Maki, Ibuki, Yasuhiro, Komaru, Gundham, Angie, and Himiko, and only these people, entered the kitchen at various times outside of usual meal hours, when the kitchen was not off-limits.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.
 
[Ibuki's Testimony](#bullet) During investigation, Ibuki was investigating the kitchen, and while handling the knife holder, accidentally let her ring fall inside one of the slits. She tried several methods to get it out, but she couldn't find a way into the opening. 

[Mukuro and Maki’s Testimony](#bullet) During their investigation, Mukuro and Maki discussed the possibility of hiding in the Archives. They confirmed that the entrance offered a clear view of all corners. Although they identified a way for a makeshift stack of books to possibly conceal someone, it would stand out enough to arouse suspicion.

[Kitchen Fire](#bullet) Kaito was attempting to cook a very masculine strawberry cake with pink frosting before one thing led to another and (in what could have happened to anyone) started a kitchen fire around 10:30 PM causing the sprinklers to douse the room in water. Maki discovered the commotion and was appropriately disappointed in him. They left the room about fifteen minutes after, with permission from Chiaki, as the room would fix itself overnight.

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

i work as a cleaner in a pvr earning 3300, sleep in a shed in a park. I have hot-spot from a coffee shop beside me and at pvr. So I can learn through my phone.

I made a few posts previously and a few guys asked me to make a post  on this sub to get a second opinion if ca would be a viable option.

Originally I wanted to do mbbs but that's not an option, mba is doable but fees is alot my age might be a problem but not left out.

I am doing my nios 12th simultaneously rn, i have good grasp of core mathematics and I can only speak English hindi not the best.

I have no idea about accounts but if I give 7-8 years can I clear ca? I'll study over 12 hours per day i don't really have anything else to do. Am I too old for ca at 24?

I dont need a lavish lifestyle i think if can give me 3-4 lpa after clearing I'll be the happiest person.

1ingzua,https://i.redd.it/auoanf39hmie1.jpeg,Another day with my Coloured paper cup.,"
Good morning everyone,

For me, each day has become so interesting that I find myself compelled to do productive things, even if they don’t hold much monetary value. This journey has taught me that while money is important, I’ve always sought a deeper sense of satisfaction, Like the one that brings genuine joy to my heart. When I was younger, I was reckless, but that was just a phase of learning and growth. Today, my heart remains young, but my mind has grown more responsible, striving for a better way of living.

Are you getting my point? Well, As humans, we shouldn’t always chase money. Instead, we should focus on what truly matters in life. Some might disagree, especially in a world that has become increasingly self-centered. When someone offers help, our first thought is often, “Why are they helping? What do they want? Are they trying to play the hero?” These doubts have created a rift in human connections. On the other hand, there are those who take advantage of kindness, using it as a comfort. This mix of attitudes has trapped us in a cycle of mistrust and negativity.

So, what can we do? My answer is simple: Smile when someone is kind to you. Ignore those who refuse to understand you. Help when someone is in need, and if you can’t help, offer support. Celebrate others successes and motivate them to achieve their goals. Be kind when someone criticises you, If they really have a point to make. Yesterday there was a situation,  person really made some sensible point, Though I partly disagree to him, I respect his opinion. By doing this, you not only bring happiness to others but also find fulfillment within yourself. After all, “Money today come, Tomorrow Go” 😂, but the memories of great moments stay with us, keeping us happy.

Ending it in my style

Zindagi ek safar hain suhaana
Yahan kal kya ho kissne jaana? ❤️
So just live the way you are. 


I just felt like sharing this. Let me know if you disagree or have thoughts to add. Share your feelings I’d love to hear them.

Yours,

1ingyz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1ingyz7/a_short_relationship/,A Short Relationship,"We met on a dating app. We spent the first week just talking on the phone all night long, despite only living 10 minutes apart. The conversation was so good. I felt like we clicked instantly. I was so attracted to just who you are. Your motivation level, how successful you are, dreams and ambitions. It was so motivating just talking to you. Once the weekend came, we decided to meet up at a bar near our houses. The date was incredible. You were everything just like you were on the phone, but in person. We talked for hours, closing down the bar. I walked you to your car where we stood and chatted for hours after. After a period of time, I broke down and told you just what an incredible woman you are. How attractive you were, how hard working you were, how motivated you were. I told you I would never meet anyone like you ever. You were blushing so hard with the biggest smile on your face. You grabbed me, and pulled me in for a first kiss. After a few dates together, I mustered up the courage to ask you to be exclusive. You said yes! I'm not sure if you saw since it was dark, but I cried a little in that moment. I thought I found ""the one"".

We had a few months together and it was rocky. Mostly from her doing. She really disconnected from me after a few weeks. We went from spending every day together, down to just 1-2 days a week. It hurt to not see you when I was only 10 minutes away. I didn't complain though. I let you have your space, and just hoped we would grow together. In retrospect, I am assuming this was intentional as you knew we would be coming to an end soon.

Your ambitious, hard working attitude came back to bite me. After spending the night at my house, you left before I was even awake. I felt like something was off. You just told me you were having trouble sleeping as always. You asked me to meet at a local coffee shop for lunch, that you had news to share with me. I knew at that point, it was over. We met at the coffee shop. I got in your car, and saw tears in your eyes, which immediately choked me up. You said you had gotten a promotion at work, something you had been working on for a long time, but this required a relocation. I lost control and cried harder than I ever had before. We shared several hugs and kisses in that moment. Each were just as special as the first time. I knew when you initially texted me to meet, that this was the end. I had a picture printed of us together on a day hike we did a few weeks prior. I was going to frame it and give it to you for Valentine's day. I brought the picture to give it to you in that moment. I hope you keep it, but I feel like that is very unlikely.

We have been separated for just over 2 weeks now, and it's really only gotten harder. We share the occasional text messages, just little check-ins to see how each other are doing. I tell you I am doing ok, but the reality is that I am not. It would feel selfish of me to tell you how bad I feel right now. You're living in a moment that you've dreamed of. The promotion you've been wanting for so long, but the reality is that this hurt me. I've wondered if it really is selfish of me to be unhappy about this? After some time thinking about it, I don't feel selfish at all. You hurt me. I won't take it out on you. I won't be upset, or display any anger, but deep down part of me wishes you held off so we could have more time together. We could then decide to move together later.

\- I joined a volunteer group a few years ago. A (25yo woman) is another volunteer in this group. I asked her out for coffee back then and she politely rejected me over text. Since then, we've kept it cordial, polite, and friendly. We never once mentioned me asking her out (almost as if it never happened).

\- Unknown to me, she was already dating B (22yo guy who's also in the volunteer group). I didn't know about this at all. A and B had been dating since before I even joined the group. If I had known, I never would've asked her out.

\- A few months ago, the entire group went out for a social night (playing ping pong, bowling, etc.). I was standing back and watching others play when A came up to me and initiated conversation. We caught up about our families, our holiday plans, etc. This conversation was very casual. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw B glaring over at us.

\- The next day, I noticed B blocked me on Instagram. A and I still follow each other. I found this funny and paid it no mind. Since then, B has been giving me a dirty stare at every volunteer event, but has never confronted me or talked to me. I always say 'what's up' to B when I see him and keep focused on the volunteer work. I believe A told B about the prior history (me asking her out), but I have no proof of this (just a gut feeling).

\- I see both A and B pretty consistently at the volunteer events. I have no issues with either of them and have acted as such. If I did have an issue, I would just hash it out one-on-one in private.



AITA for not paying B any mind, continuing to be as polite/cordial as possible, and acting as if I don't know what's going on? I'm not sure I've done anything wrong, but maybe I'm wrong? Thanks everyone.",1,1739328511.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I had matched with her on hinge 3 years ago but had never met. Since that time it's been weekly short back and forth exchanges with most of my communication ultimately circling back towards trying to arrange a date but her ultimately deferring due to ""having so much going on"" or sometimes giving a specific reason which I (perhaps naively) believe to be legitimate. 

About two weeks go by without a response to a few multi texts I send (faux pas maybe but in the context make sense, as she has indicated that wasn't a problem) which I felt for me came to a head about any remaining interest, so I decided to call and leave a message asking for a date. Responds via text that she's been having a hard time deciding whether to date and it might change in the next couple months. In short, I say ok, I'll reach back out then!

To add to this I noticed she's active on hinge since this exchange, adding to my confusion (or maybe now clearing it up). 

My self respect here says break it off asap and move on. But the other, more willing to see the good innocent part of me says ok, she's legitimately not ready and is maybe getting ready to start taking dates, but obviously not in a rush to start with me and/or is taking a more democratic approach.

It was the most intense heart breaking thing ever because I didn’t want to leave but she would get in miserable moods and just show aggression to me all day long. 

She would get very overwhelmed and I honestly did have an issue of not backing off when I should have. But most of the days, she would just get very mad at me for stuff like not hanging my coat up and we would argue for days about it. In the end, she’d just say she was overwhelmed and I didn’t give her the space she needed. Which was an issue, but she overused it situations that it didn’t apply to, respectfully. 

After the breakup, she rushed into a new long term relationship with this guy a month later.

Anyways, we are okay and friends. We still talk and catch up. We hung out a couple days ago and grabbed coffee, we were very happy to see each other and see that we’re both doing good. 

But since then we haven’t talked and recently she posted on her Facebook and instagram story, 4 times in a row, a relationship quote that says “love is about comforting your partner when they’re overwhelmed, not making them sound crazy” which was eerily similar to what she said to me all the time. So I feel like it was targeted towards me. Saying her new bf doesn’t do that(even tho in the first year we didn’t have that issue either)

My thing is, if this was targeted towards me, why the resentment and passive aggression after we caught up and were happy to see each other? It genuinely hurts me because I felt bad about everything and we’ve talked and apologized to each other for everything.

1ingvhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1ingvhn/i_felt_the_kiss_and_saw_the_mist/,I felt the kiss and saw the mist.,"In the summer of 2016, I had a particular vendetta for lack of a better word.

There was an anger inside of me that was focused on one important family member of mine, but spilled over into an entire subsection of our population that we call heroes.

During that summer, video after video emerged of another innocent person being shot. 

All of a sudden, the populace fought back. Innocent heroes were dying as well.

That's not sarcasm.

.....

I don't condone after the fact acts of vigilantism or terrorism.

I also didn't buy the company line ...

""It's not like he woke up that morning and decided to shoot someone.""

That was literally the ""talking point"" on Fox News.

....

At that time, Teddy, Darla and I were living our best life.

I was a poverty stricken trustafarian.

Lived in Stetson Hills, CO.

Had the two story house to myself and my two dogs.

The Universe was on our side.

....

When Teddy placed his nose against my right cheek, I felt the kiss of my Mom.

At that exact time, I saw an aberration - a white most that filled the size of her 5' 1"" body.

I felt the kiss and saw the mist.

That was my motivation for doing what I did. To protect the innocent. To affect change.

It didn't work.

However, the work within me was set in motion. I was able to find a healthy outlet for the anger that I had held so long against that particular subset of the population.

An anger that started when I watched them kick Rodney King to sleep.

.....

Fast forward to today.

I'm just as spooky spiritual.

Just as willing to stand in the gap to affect change.

Even more aware that the only change that truly matters is the change that comes from within.

I'll never stop standing in the gap for those who can't.

I will stop even responding to comments on Reddit. It's a cesspool of ....

Actually it's not a cesspool. It's a dark environment, that is moist and a breeding ground for bacteria. 

You never know someone's motivation.

That I do care about.

....

I will continue to journal my journey. Leaving breadcrumbs for those who search the r/vagabond sub. My original intention.

Journal my experience for my own healing. Very similar to a minister, therapist or even a sponsor: write them a letter and burn it.

Also quite the opposite.

Write the letter and post it on Reddit.

Along with my picture, my real name, etc.

Whether I'm an attention seeker or not is irrelevant. Whether you read or not is equally irrelevant.

You can't buy food with Reddit Karma.

""Top 1% poster just means I'm a chronic poster.""

It's neither good nor bad.

However, your judgement of the situation is yours to have.

....

Today I had one of those spooky spiritual moments.

It started just over two weeks ago when I was hitchhiking. Everything was falling into place. 

So much so, I came to a shelter.

Something I didn't run to when freezing rain was in the forecast.

Everyone from vagabonds, to do-gooders, local heroes and even a soldier said I should get out of the weather.

I knew of I stayed dry, I would stay alive.

My hammock and tarp did exactly that.

The soldier was wrong. But he got my attention. Condensation wasn't even on my radar. I removed the piece that would have given me that problem.

...

Back to today.

I took my free bus pass and rode around. Originally I was going to wait for the library to open.

Then I decided, why go there. I chose a McDonald's on the other side of town. Freez warm bis ride. 99 cents coffee.

That was after the best breakfast the Jesus House serves. Apparently, Tuesday is biscuits and gravy, flavorful eggs and hash browns. I got a second serving to go.

So no refills at McDonald's. I had two cups at the Jesus House.

I stopped by Door of Hope and picked up an XXL fleece. $4.

It's going to be cold AF in a few days. Especially the walk to work.

....

Ate lunch at the Jesus House.

Chili. It was good too.

Tuesday's night be my favorite day.

I walked the 30' to the library. Enjoying the fresh air.

I see two dogs.

I've seen the brown dog every time I make that walk. He's (he/she) normally by the dumpster down the street.

I always talk. He stops. Listens. But never approaches.

I can't say that I've seen the black dog before.

....

*** Spooky Spiritual Disclaimer ***

I think of Teddy and Darla.

They have a way of showing up when I need them.

Scientists, at least some, believe that petting a dog relieves stress.

I speak softly to the Universe.

Out loud.

I'm homeless. Who cares if I talk to myself. Fr.

""Teddy. Darla. If that's you, show me a sign.""

Teddy and Darla would play fight every morning. 

I see these two dogs sniffing on the ground.

I stop. Put my kids backpack down.

They start play fighting.

I'm enjoying the show.

The library will be there until 7 pm. Why enter prison any earlier than I have to?

They both come over to me.

Both of them are pressing against me.

I'm rubbing behind their ears. Under their necks. Petting them as well 

Now they are both forcefully pressing against me.

The black dog is standing on my foot.

If I told you what Teddy and Darla used to do, well that's what they did.

I know.

I'm spooky spiritual.

....

That's the reason I'm at the shelter.

When everything falls into place, I'm dumb enough to just hang out a while.

No rush to leave.

No rush to runaway.

As uncomfortable as things may get, I'm still here waiting to see why the Universe brought me here.

Maybe it was just for today.

Two stray dogs. One stray human.

Bonding over a shared experience.

....

I even asked them.

""If you want we can runaway. Today. Together.""

But I'm not actually sure if the dogs are homeless.

Like me they just may have an affinity for dumpsters.",14,1739328331.0,vagabond,2,0.94,False

Now having flashbacks. and dementia.   Set off burglar alarm at 4 AM and going out the front door , saying he was on his way to the city     The loud alarm startled him, and I pointed out there was no car out there and we would go to the city  another day.  I managed to get him back to bed after pointing out it was pitch black outside..He has become increasingly agitated about not being allowed to wander down into the woods by himself, and his time on the back porch inside the locked fence was irritating him,  our little terrier who my husband knew before he was  mentally unstable, he knew she could not be trusted to get out of the fence because she takes off chasing squirrels etc and the one time before she escaped was gone for two days and we thought the coyotes had eaten her..  I think that was in 2017. He used to know she can not be let loose.  One day this past week he and the dog were outside together, and he picked up Daisy and put her outside the fence and she took off into the woods.  Luckily our neighbor's son was home and could come down as husband wanted to go into the woods to look for her and then I would have two  - him and the dog - gone..  Our neighbor stayed with husband and I found the dog, thankfully fairly quickly.He has ""seen "" people in the kitchen with me... On Sunday he got so irritated even though I had taken a walk with him, once he was in the fenced in yard with the locked gates  and started trying to tear off the fence boards with his bare hands.  I got him inside, he was still yelling and went into his bedroom and ripped off a handle on his closet door and in a rage got all of his clothes out of his closet and threw them on the floor.  I called our son and thankfully the distraction of talking to him on the phone got him called down, but I was ready to call the police , I was very frightened. Later that evening he had auditory hallucinations of big bangs going off around the house , and I got him distracted by saying it was the TV.I had ordered the baby proof door knob things and our son came and helped me put those on all the outside doors and the one to the laundry room so I can lock daisy in there when he goes out on the back porch .  I also turn off the electricity to the stove at the circuit box in the garage at night.  and unplug toaster, coffee maker , microwave etc just in case.   I have not heard him banging around in the kitchen at night .  I lock my bedroom door at night and I do have a baby monitor cam thing so I can hear if he falls or needs help.  So things have deteriorated quite a bit all of a sudden with the wanting to wander, the anger, aggression and anxiety in the last two weeks.   He had his iron infusion last WEdnesday then I started the lexapro after that as I did not want side effects to prevent us from going .   Now the doctor has changed him to Seroquel 25 mg.   I'm worried about the side effects and falling.  I guess I have no choice..  Is this a low dose ? and they said give it at bedtime.  I cut off water at 8 PM..  I guess I will give it at 11 PM.. does it work for 24 hours to squash symptoms  and they are then not sleepy during the day?  Would like to hear from others who have used this drug .  My husband took lexapro 5 mg for about 4 days, but it seems obvious that is not going to do enough

1ingrux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1ingrux/what_can_rejection_triad_tell_us_about_nature_of/,What can rejection triad tell us about nature of power over others?,"I am in eastern side (Chinese rooted, living in Thailand) of the world and it seems like our concept of power is quite different from western. And I think it is interesting to share and talk about.

In my country Enneagram, we call rejection triad power triad. Rejection triad represent three types of power: Violence, Knowledge and Love.

So, we have three ways to gain authorative influence over other human being. One is violence, to coerce others into submission by force. One is to have knowledge and outwit others. One is to have love, to grab people heart.

I think power in form of violence (represent by 8s) is already discussed widely so I don't see much point in repeating that. It's simply ability to control, to have direct physical consequence over others, etc etc. 

It is too obvious to the point that many people think that is only form of ""real power"". And that is exactly why I want to write this post, to remind ourselves to not overlook other form of power.

**Power of knowledge**

Well, one thing people tends to forget is that in order to have power over a thing, you first need to know that thing exists. And that's the pure smallest form of knowledge.

You might be a king. You might have a lot of army. You might be able to command everything. But you can't destroy, crush or command rebel if you don't even know who is on your side and who is on rebel side.

You need to know something in order to have power over that thing. At minimum, you need to know that thing exists to begin with. 

Nowadays no matter how rich, resourceful or economically powerful you are, you can't have power over Satoshi Nakamoto creator of Bitcoin. Because we don't know them, we can't have power over them no matter how big our force is.

You need to know where, when. And if you know about strength, weakness, etc. The more you know about them, the more power you have over them.

And that's power of knowledge.

In Chinese history, there was a big big army who got crushed by Zhuge Liang simply who know about weather, and basically destroy the whole army using power of weather prediction. He knows the direction of the wind. He set a small fire which through power of the wind, becoming a big fire that destroy whole enemy army fleet.

Or be more recent, USA basically win WW2 because knowledge of nuclear physics and then lose Vietnam war because of knowledge of terrain and being so illusive.

Knowledge is a form of power.

**Power of love**

Now this is the form of power that I think many people overlook. The power over other people heart.

Love is power over your heart. Love can make you blind. Love can make you subdue to your lover on your own will.

Love is not just a romantic love. Maybe it is just simply a favor. It is embedded in our human psyche that when someone do something for you, you have a natural tendency to pay something back. And if you don't, you feel guilty.

That is why many people hate toxic 2s. Technically speaking, toxic 2s pattern is just they serve you and give you things. Then when you stop reciprocating they just simply say bunch of words.

Technically speaking, you haven't been physically attack and you lose nothing at this point. And yet, you can't help feeling attacked. You feel like your strings is being pulled toward something like a mannequin and you don't like this feeling at all.

And that ability to pull and play with emotional string, is power of love.

To demonstrate this power: I would go back to story of the kings.

There were so many historical & legend of eastern kings who have his heart grab by his queen, mistress or concumbine.

Technically speaking: The king can order execution of his mistress with just single word and his soldier will do exactly that, no question asked. 

And yet the king can't bring his body or his mouth to do that. Furthermore, the idea of harming his mistress will never ever come to his mind. The king have his heart grab by his mistress, and just a simply idea of hurting his mistress is unbearable to think about to begin with.

There are so many time in Chinese history where a king have ""technically his kingdom and army"" being ruled by queen, mistress or concumbine in a palace. 

And that is extreme power of love. (And no, it is never just sex. It is a merit, it is a relationship, it is an emotional connection they have together.)

I can even say that Don Vito Colerone (which as clearly 2s to me) is become Godfather of mafia porld because he understand power of love beyond power of violence. He owns many people a favor. A godfather will help you and when the time comes, he will ask for you to pay back. Don Vito Corleone know that by holding power over people heart, the resistant will be lower. 

It is not a simple transaction. It is a family.

You don't follow Don simply because you afaird of consequence or because you need his protection. You follow him because he take care of you. He spend time with you in a coffee, in a your daughther wedding ceremony, etc and he shows that he truly care.

As Don Vito quotes:

> You cannot say ‘no’ to the people you love, not often. That’s the secret. And then when you do, it has to sound like a ‘yes’. Or you have to make them say ‘no.’ You have to take time and trouble. 

(And from this quote I don't even know how people even type Don Vito 8s. An 8s who refrain himself from saying ""no"" and reframe saying ""no"" to roundabout ""yes""? What the hell? It is almost like people think only 8s is capable of violence.)

When you grab people heart, the resistance become naturally lower. Even people who managed to betray Vito will feel deep sense of guilt in their own heart, which make their mind and body dull and less effective.

And that's it. That's what rejection triad teach us about 3 forms of power: Violence, Knowledge and Love",14,1739328019.0,Enneagram,4,1.0,False

Some background:

Martin is a main character, in this flash-back he is a lieutenant colonel.

They are assaulting a rebel presence on a vacation village (imagine troops landing in a remote version of Waikiki or Clearwater beach, or possibly a Caribbean island)

Description of the village:  
This place hadn’t always been this bad Lieutenant-Colonel Ridgedale thought, looking over the coastline projected in the holo-pit table in front of him.

Half-Moon Mountain City was once a beautiful tourist attraction on the coastline, where the eponymous mountain that looked like it had been sliced in half plunged into the ocean protecting the vast beachhead behind it. Surfers and other recreational watercraft had played in the wild waves and currents around the granite monolith that dominated the area. Other rocky outcroppings in the water protected the tourist town from the worst of the eastern seas’ sometimes violent weather. A natural harbor had been expanded by the cruise companies allowing the enormous tourist ships access to the prized beach and villages beyond. The hills behind the city were lush and full of farms that grew tropical delights, much of the planet’s chocolate and coffee was cultivated in this area. Unlike so many cities there was no airport, all of the trade with the city came or left by ship.

Martin had been here years ago, before the rebellion broke out, and like so many thousands before him, enjoyed tropical drinks on that vast stretch of soft sand, swam in the warm tropical waters, and partook in the other delights the city’s often Carnivale-like nightlife held for singles of all persuasions.

1ingotc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ingotc/i_cant_get_rid_of_the_flies_in_my_house/,I can’t get rid of the flies in my house.,"I’d been living in the old Victorian for six months when I first noticed the flies. They congregated in the corner of the study, a fist-sized stain on the faded Persian carpet that seemed to pulse with them. No matter how many times I sprayed insecticide or laid traps, they returned—droning, persistent, their bodies glinting like obsidian beads in the sunlight. The previous owner had warned me the house had “quirks,” but this felt deliberate. As though the stain was so delicious to them that they couldn’t help but gather there.

One sweltering July afternoon, I snapped. “Fuck it, I’ll just replace it”, I mumbled as I tore the carpet up with a crowbar. Sweat dripped down my neck as I removed the culprit section of the carpet. Beneath the moth-eaten fabric was a patch of warped hardwood covered in maggots, its edges blackened as if scorched. “Whaaat the fuck”, I said to myself in disgust. A single floorboard sat slightly raised, like a crooked tooth. I pried it loose with the crowbar, half expecting to find human remains underneath, but instead; there, in the hollow beneath, lay a book.  

It wasn’t like the gothic grimoires from movies. This was small; kind of like those pocket Bibles you find in hotel rooms. It was bound in cracked suede the color of dried blood and its pages were yellowed and brittle. The symbols inside weren’t Latin—they squirmed, shifting under my gaze like centipedes. Yet somehow, I *understood* them. A chant whispered in my mind, sweet and coaxing: *“Speak me, and I’ll make the flies go away.”*  

I laughed. A nervous, breathy sound. What harm could it do?  

That night, with a bottle of bourbon as my courage, I knelt over the floorboard hollow and recited the words aloud. The air turned syrupy, smelling of wet soil and rotting fruit. Then came the voice—smooth as oil, amused.  

**“Ah, a pragmatist.”**  

The man who materialized before me was… ordinary? Mid-thirties, unshaven, dressed in a rumpled linen shirt and slacks. His eyes were the only oddity—pale green, flecked with gold, like sunlight through a swamp. He gestured to the stain on the floor. **“Flies, right? Nasty business. Let’s fix that.”** A snap of his fingers, and the insects crumbled to ash.  

“Who… *what* are you?” I stammered.  

**“A problem-solver,”** he said, grinning. **“Call me Baz. And you, my friend, just earned yourself a favor.”**  

Over the next week, Baz became a fixture. He fixed the leaking roof, unclogged the septic tank, even brewed a mean cup of coffee. He joked about modern life, lamented the “paperwork” of his job, and never once mentioned demons or souls. To be honest, I actually kind of enjoyed his company but after a few more days I grew suspicious of his helpfulness eventually driving me to ask what he wanted in return.

“ Seriously though, Baz, why are you doing all of this?”

he waved me off. **“Consider it a housewarming gift. But… if you’re feeling generous, a little signature wouldn’t hurt.”** He produced a simple receipt, no different from one you’d get from a convenience store.**“You see, I’m somewhat of a handyman and and all I need is a signature right here at the bottom. Standard stuff—acknowledgment of services rendered.”**  

I should’ve read it. But the flies were gone. The house was warm, finally *mine*. I scribbled my name.  

The moment the ink dried, Baz’s skin split.  

His body erupted into a mass of writhing maggots, eyes boiling into pus-yellow orbs. Wings—translucent, veined—sprouted from his back, buzzing with the sound of a thousand flies. The voice that emerged was a chorus of screams.  

**“Souls are so much sweeter when given, not taken,”** Belzebub crooned, a clawed hand pressing over my chest. Coldness spread, my breath frosting in the air. **“Don’t look so grim! You’ll live a long, happy life… until I come to collect.”**  

The lights flickered and he vanished, leaving the stench of sulfur.

I tried to burn the grimoire. It wouldn’t catch fire.  

Now, when I wake at 3 a.m., I hear him laughing in the walls—a sound like broken glass and wings. The flies are back, too, but now they follow me around.

It’s been two years since the last time I saw Baz and I pray it was all just a bad dream, but just as I start to drift off to sleep, I hear a buzzing next to my ear.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ingffq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1ingffq/day_1_in_hanoi/,Day 1 in Hanoi,"I was sitting on a bus a decided to write about my travels. Its a semi long read :)

**Day 1: Arrival in Hanoi**

I made it. After 16 hours of flight time (14 from Vancouver, plus a quick 2 hours from Hong Kong), I’ve finally touched down in Hanoi. Every year I plan a solo trip of two to three weeks with just me, my backpack and a sense of wanderlust. This year with a busy work schedule and with a little extra cash, I decided to book a 3 week itinerary from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, all set up by Epic Adventures Vietnam. It’ll be nice not having to deal with any travel planning for the first time. The trip is set in stone and all I have to do is enjoy the journey.



I step out into Noi Bai terminal, a compact yet modern international airport about 30 KMs away from Hanoi. I walk by a line of gift and noodle shops, tempting me with the first taste of Vietnam. I reach the arrivals area of the airport and immediately I’m met with the humidity of Hanoi. A smile fills my face, I’m happy to be here in the tropics once again. I walk by a line of people with signs, I see a friendly Vietnamese fellow with a sign that reads Epic Adventures in big red letters. That’s my ride! I joined a group of about 10 or 11 people—all excited for the days ahead. We quickly board a shuttle and reach our stay for the night: the elegant Bonjour Hanoi Hotel. It’s an early night and we have a day full of activities planned for us tomorrow.  



Early in the morning at 8 AM, our group guide, Minh Nguyen—a friendly Vietnamese man who always had a grin on his face, greeted our group of 10 people. He gave us a quick introduction before going over the history of the Old Quarters where our hotel was located. He said we’d be having breakfast at his favourite bún chả spot. As we strolled over to the restaurant, he gave more interesting tidbits about the Old Quarters. Immediately the group was enthralled by the tube (thin yet highly built) houses that line the streets. We finally arrived at Ô Bún Chả and we’re immediately greeted with the aroma of grilled meats in the air. It smells fantastic. Our group is seated at a long table. Our dishes quickly arrive and each of us were met with a steaming bowl of smoked meats in a fragrant sauce served alongside vermicelli, fresh lettuce and herbs. Minh, our ever friendly guide told us to dip the veggies and noodles into the sauce and to chow it down with the delicious grilled meats. This might just be my new favorite dish in Vietnam!



After our hearty breakfast, our guide walks us around the Old Quarters some more. We’re led by beer street in the Old Quarters and told we’d end our night here. It’s not busy but I wonder what the night will look like. We finally reached our next destination, Linh Coffee—a cozy open air coffee shop on the side of a road in the Old Quarter. We’re all recommended to try an Egg Coffee, a Hanoi specialty. My coffee arrived with a custardy yellow foam at the top. I take my first sip and wow it’s delicious. Creamy egg yolk with hints of sweetness and the robustness of Vietnamese coffee melding together certainly hits the spot. My day has now officially started.



Our next destination of the day is visiting Uncle Ho, the revered communist leader of Vietnam who passed away in 1969. Today you can find him at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. His body is embalmed in a glass case for thousands of visitors to pay respects to every day. Once you’re there, you can truly feel the high regard and respect that the locals have for this man. His body, perfectly preserved and displayed in a solemn setting. To see it in person is a truly surreal experience. I remember thinking: wow, this man is responsible for the modern Vietnam of today. The history and the significance of the man is lying all there for me to see in person. Definitely a surreal yet humbling experience. 



After the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, our next stop is the Temple of Literature, also known as the first university complex of Vietnam founded in 1070 by Emperor Ly Thang Tong. Until the colonial period, it had been open for over 700 years and educated hundreds of renowned scholars and mandarins. Visiting here, I immediately felt the grandeur, serenity and historical importance of the place. It was pretty cool walking around the grounds where students and scholars used to stroll many centuries ago. I’ve got to admit, it was well preserved for such an old establishment. There are five courtyards here, all representing different meanings and significance. My favorite courtyard was the one with the massive square pond.  It’s hard to describe the beauty of the place, so here are some pictures for you to see. 



After visiting the two places, it was finally time for some food. I was feeling hungry from all the walking. There was no need to board Epic Adventure’s shuttle bus, instead the group walked on over to “Pho Bo Huong Hieu”. As soon as I arrive, I can smell the aroma of pho in the air. I’m excited, this will be my first bowl of pho in Vietnam in years. The pho of Northern Vietnam is fragrant and quite different from the pho served in the south of Vietnam. You’ll find a lighter broth served with tons of green onions. I slurped down the bowl in a matter of minutes—it was that good. 



After lunch, our group was given the freedom to explore Hanoi on our leisure. I’m not going to lie, 16 hours of flights is pretty tiring, so I joined the shuttle back to the hotel for a quick nap.



Hours later, my phone rings, I answer and hear “Hi Mr. Tom, your jeep tour is waiting for you downstairs”. I sprung up, got dressed and made my way downstairs. Several big green military jeeps line the streets. The inner child in me is beaming. We hop in the back of the jeeps with our groups and now rumble through the streets of Hanoi. So far it’s my favorite experience since landing in Hanoi. The jeeps are open-air and I can feel the wind brushing against my hair while the sounds of the city ring all around. We make several stops including the opera house, a couple bridges and street food stops. One of the nicest parts of the journey was the peaceful ride around Hoan Kiem Lake. The streets are filled with motorcycles as happy families roam around the lakes. Our second last stop is the Hanoi Train Street where we get out and sit on tiny stools and tables right by the railroad tracks. I order a lemon iced tea and hear a train coming in the distance. I sit nervously as a train whizzes by. I swear it felt inches from my knees. Finally, our jeep tour concludes and our jeeps drop us off at our last stop: Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre.



There’s a busy crowd out front of the theatre. We collect our tickets from Minh and saunter over to our assigned seating. As the theatre fills up, the group goes over the day’s activities and their favorite highlights. The jeep tour was the clear favorite among us. The lights turn off and the stage lights up. We’re greeted by a colorful group of puppets floating and gliding across water. This was much better than I thought it was going to be. The music, the lights, the dancing puppets—it was a mesmerizing display. I can tell the group was drawn and in awe. After about 45 minutes, the show concludes and we’re now given freedom to roam Hanoi on our own.



Our guide and the group decide to go for some Bia Hanoi’s on some tiny stools in what is known as Beer Corner. It’s a nice, fun yet wild setting to end the day along with some people watching and a tipsy conversation with new friends. 24 hours ago I was in my home city of Vancouver and today I’m buzzed with a Bia Hanoi in Hanoi, Vietnam—I’m elated to be here. After about an hour of back and forth mingling, the streets are packed, people are literally squeezing right beside us and the air is filled with energy. Some of us decide to stick around and venture out into the night. I decide to hit the hay and head back to the hotel to relax for another day of fun.



A huge shoutout to Epic Adventures Vietnam for making my first day in Hanoi unforgettable! From street food to jeep rides, history to late-night beers—this is just the start of an epic journey. Stay tuned for day 2!

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1. Can I move to PH with a budget of $2.50 a day?

2. Why do people with less money than me try to get my money?

3. Complaining about people complaining.

4. Letting everyone know you’re one of the “good” foreigners and so virtuous that you won’t even eat a cheeseburger because you’re so integrated.

I ain’t complaining, the posts are very amusing (it’s why I read them). I think it’s hilarious that people seem bewildered when people post negative things.

The truth is that no one is really interested in normal life here. My typical day is waking up in my house in the mountains, walk a couple blocks away from my subdivision with no roosters or dogs and have a coffee at the local cafe overlooking a volcano while enjoying a pretty much year round 70-80 degree temp.

Then I walk home, mess around in the internet, play some video games and maybe play some Warhammer or board games with my wife and son when he gets home from school. There is nothing compelling or interesting (to an observer) about my typical day, and I imagine it’s the same for most other expats. I of course, find it compelling and interesting, and enjoy my life here.

Because someone occasionally observes that traffic can be a bit dangerous, or that people take forever at the ATMs doesn’t mean they hate it here. It just means it’s more interesting to talk about than how they spent their night watching TV.",9,1739326556.0,Philippines_Expats,15,0.81,False

1ingabx,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ingabx/is_keurigs_kexpress_the_best_singleserve_coffee/,Is Keurig's K-Express the best single-serve coffee maker for your mornings? A review,"Exploring my kitchen counter recently, I realized how much Keurig's K-Express coffee maker has become an indispensable morning companion. As someone who thrives on coffee, my mornings demand efficiency, and this sleek gadget delivers just that. The model boasts a modern matte black finish and a compact design that easily fits into tight spaces, which is a huge win for small kitchens.

This single-serve machine offers three brew sizes—8, 10, and 12 ounces—with an additional Strong Button feature for those days when I need an extra caffeine kick. The Strong Button genuinely enhances the flavor depth, making my coffee more robust, which I love. One of the highlights is the 42-ounce removable reservoir. I can brew up to four cups before refilling, which is a lifesaver during busy mornings when my family decides to join the coffee rush.

The setup process was straightforward. I unpacked it, peeled off the protective tape, and filled the water reservoir. Within minutes, the coffee was brewing. It’s worth mentioning that the back-to-back brewing ability is fantastic. There's no need to wait for the reheating process—you can brew cup after cup effortlessly.

**Pros**

1. **Compact Design**: Its slim build doesn’t crowd my counter, making it ideal for limited spaces.
2. **Strong Brew Option**: The Strong Button is a game-changer for stronger, bolder coffee.
3. **42oz. Removable Reservoir**: Brew multiple cups without constant refills—a time-saver.
4. **Travel Mug Compatibility**: The adjustable drip tray accommodates travel mugs up to 7.4 inches tall.
5. **Energy Efficiency**: Auto-off feature saves power by turning the machine off after five minutes of inactivity.

**Cons**

1. **Water Level Sensitivity**: The machine occasionally asks for a refill when there’s enough water for one more small cup.
2. **Reusable Pod Compatibility**: Not all reusable coffee pods fit perfectly, which can be limiting for those preferring customized brews.
3. **Noise Levels**: While brewing is swift, it’s not the quietest coffee maker I’ve used.
4. **Plastic Build**: The lightweight plastic feels less durable compared to higher-end models.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Nespresso Essenza Mini, the Keurig K-Express is more versatile in terms of brew sizes and pod variety. While Nespresso excels in delivering espresso shots with a creamy finish, it lacks the Strong Button feature that Keurig offers for bolder flavors. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another contender, offering flexibility with both K-cups and ground coffee. However, the K-Express stands out for its quicker brewing time and compact design.

In terms of efficiency and convenience, Keurig has nailed it with this model. Its energy-saving features, rapid brewing, and compact footprint make it a better fit for smaller households or offices compared to bulkier coffeemakers like the Cuisinart SS-15. Yet, the reusable pod limitations can be a drawback for eco-conscious users who appreciate the Cuisinart’s compatibility with all pod types.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The K-Express sits at a reasonable price point for single-serve brewers, especially given its advanced features like the Strong Button and a removable reservoir. It strikes a balance between affordability and functionality, making it a worthwhile investment for coffee lovers. While it might lack the premium build of pricier models, it compensates with consistent performance and user-friendly design. If you’re looking for a reliable coffee maker without shelling out a fortune, this fits the bill.

With daily use, I’ve come to appreciate how quickly it brews and how little effort it takes to maintain. Descaling is a breeze, and the machine's lightweight design makes it easy to move for cleaning. While it’s not entirely without flaws, it ticks most boxes for what you’d want in a single-serve coffee maker.

I went to Seoul and saw industrial robot arms serving coffee and ice cream. By my intuition, it appears to be more cost effective and convenient, as cafe owner do not need to pay hourly rate and concern about recruiting and maintaining work force.

However, the majority of cafe in both Korea and the rest of the world are run by human staffs. So my question is why hasn't robot barista replaced humans in cafe yet? What are the technological obstacles that robot baristas face? What needs to be achieved so that robot baristas can be thought to be a more reasonable choice than hiring humans?

Thanks in advance!",0,1739326471.0,robotics,6,0.5,False
