DISCLAIMER : these are personal Opinions. Do not take them as gospel . These are simply directional advice. Personal experience may vary. 


FOR INTROVERTED INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE :

1. Hyd Reads / Hyd Paints / urban sketchers hyd chapter : these are niche interest groups that you can visit if you want some me time. People mostly let you be, and you can just chill and come back. Highly recommend if you've had a rough week and just want to unwind by thineself 

2. Social sailor art workshops / artisan bay art workshops / creative Horizon art workshops / bookmyshow art workshops : these are great if you want to partake in a one time art venture. Would not recommend for serious artists, since the level is usually from noob to amateur. No disrespect. Im a noob myself. However, if you wanna join them and HOST these workshops , lemme know! I can get you in contact with them. 

3. There are some lovely cafes that you can go to , just to be with yourself, with nary a person to bother you. Some that I found great for my peace of mind are Last House coffee and ratio . 


IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BE A LITTLE MORE SOCIAL IN LIFE , BUT NOT A FULL FLEDGED EXTROVERT (i fall in this category so I might have more points here)

1. Ace of Pub quizzes : if you have obscure knowledge of certain topics and like to be competitive , this is the place for you !! Listen you dont need to be a genius. I've won this by answering 10/56 questions. Its fine. Its about thinking and putting yourself out there. Did I mention if you come in top 3, you get free beers? Talk about incentive. Also there are themed quizzes like friends, GOT, memes and all. Free entry!  Why not do it! Comment or DM if you want more info 

2. Open mics : these are honestly a blessing. You have pages like ExploreYou , heart for art , downwithlit that host monthly open mics. You can come as an audience to just hear some talented people, or you can showcase your own!! The audience and members are so bloody supportive, it gave me a false sense of confidence that I could sing xD. Also it's a lovely networking opportunity , I got a few interview calls also out of this ! 

3. ParaDice : brothers and sisters, if you like board games, this place is a heaven!!!!!! And the best part, it domt matter if its a small group, big group, or just you!  They have games for all ! And the best part, you can opt in to sit with another group and boom, new friend circle. The owners Sai and Ravali are just absolute cuties. Infact if youre going, just drop a DM ill just hop on by .

4. Communite : a bit of a ""everything under 1 roof"" situation . They have WhatsApp communities for anything and everything you might be interested in ( a hyperbole ) . So if you want to play a sport or have a niche interest, this place is great for finding like minded people. You can also get to be a part of their org committe if you play your cards right! 


5. Finally, a lot of cafes have a bunch of events happening. The ones I mentioned above are some of the best I've been to. From coffee roasting sessions to listening sessions to run clubs to game nights . So pick your poison and come along 

FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY EXTROVERTED 

1. Social sailor social events/ small world social events ( would not recommend but hey beggars cant be choosy ) / cafe standing tables : eh since its not my cup of coffee I cant really tell you much about it, but I've been approached in Last house, just by the book I've been reading and it led to pleasant conversations. Ive seen a fancy helmet and struck up a conversation about bikes. People are actually willing to open up, just gotta scout the right ones. If you ever see me , feel free to come up and have a chat about anything you love yapping about. 

2. Playace : this is an app for house parties ._. Strangers meet kinda situation. Do not worry, there's a strict verification policy, so safety is very well kept ( no kidney stealing ). It can be a hit or miss depending on the people you meet, some might be social some not. But hey life is a gamble, it pays off sometime. 

Now if I've missed something, please feel free to add! If you want more info. Please do ask in the comments or DM . Im fine with either! 

Im also open if you wanna make plans to go to any of these places, guys and girls alike! Age is no restriction, unless youre below 21 ._. ( for certain things mentioned Here)",2,1761897317.0,hyderabad,0,1.0,False

Am I being too uptight/inflexible? She usually gives noncomittal answers for bigger plans, which is one thing, but I want to know if I'm maybe taking these small plans too seriously? I have been called inflexible in the past. ",1,1761897263.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

I apologise in advance if some details feel like a kid doing these things but I was hurt, confused, extremely sad

I dated a girl for a short period a while back. I fell in love with her but she didn't. She said she couldn't see a future with me and ended things. She said we could stay in touch as friends so I did that. I ended up hurting her 2-3 times during this friendship initially and things got tought but we started talking again as friends. It's been 4.5 months since we broke up. Earlier when we were dating there were 2-3 times when we had a fight and i woild react on text message and she would find that extremely rude. From my perspective i wasn't trying to be rude but it always seemed that way to her that my tone is rude. We had decided to be open about our past. In these when we were dating and had a fight, I once told her how maybe she hid about this one guy who she was maybe in a relationship with. I had checked her instagram profile, old posts and comments and one guys comments and her replies made me feel like they were more than friends. When I asked her about it, I felt her reaction was different but she said she was surprised because he's just a good childhood friend. She didn't say how close they were. Once when I saw his name on her screen on Instagram while sharing a reel on top, she said they exchange a lot of reels. 
After we ended things she said we could be friends, so I tried to stay friends even though  I have strong feelings towards her. We initially had many problems even stopped talking once but got back to talking again. For the last month things were going good, we used to meet up for coffee as friends as well. Last weekend, few days ago, i saw her with a friend. She did introduce me to him before i left. I knew who he is. What I saw that he has the exact same two tattoos on his hand as she does. They are just on opposite hands but at the same placement.  One of the tattoos is a symbol of sun and other is the word ""constant"". These are old tattoos. One is 6 years old and other her 3.5. She had told me how she doesn't get any random tattoos and tattoos have meaning to them for her. She only gets tattoo which she connects to. I saw the guy's tattoo and my heart sank. When we were dating i had been open about everything specially the past because that's what we had decided. She hid this big fact from me. For the two days that he was here in this city (maybe 2, idk if more. He lives in a different city), i saw her instagram stories of being in a cafe and restaurant. For the first time i didn't react anything to her photos.  She was extremely happy, a different kind of happy. I was extremely  sad thinking they are in a relationship (which idk). Her last story which she uploaded around 12-12.30am was collage of video clips of her selfie and she looked extremely happy and glowing. And around 1.30 am when I opened her profile i saw that i cant her story or highlights anymore which meant she hid me from her stories. I impulsively texted her ""thank you for moving me to the hidden list of your stories. "" she sent two emojis and said excuses me as if she didn't do it. I checked multiple times and i couldn't  see her highlights as well. She told me why would she do it. She has nothing to HIDE from me. I told her this and also said ""Don't lie to me atleast. I just want you to be honest"". She once again said the same thing. And said she found my tone extremely  rude. She said this happened in the past as well, the way i react. It's rude She doesn't allow such a tone. I said I agree the first msg was rude and ended up confessinghow i still like her a lot and this makes confused and idk what i say. She replied that i need to get out of this ASAP as she has already done it. She removed me from insta and ended the friendship as well.


And then her last message ""we met through mutuals. I thought we can be good friends. But you're totally something else"". These lines. These hurt the most. As if she now thinks I'm crazy. I knew it was gonna, most probably, but still had that lingering hope. But to end like this? Like where she thinks I am a completely different person, this doesn't sit right, it makes me feel really bad and i just want to tell her how I saw the tattoos and why reacted the way I did even when I know this wouldn't change things between us. I want her to know what I saw and not think I'm crazy. 

I don't know what I should do and I am very confused. I want to text her apologise for my behaviour and tell her how I felt when I saw them. I  haven't told her tell that I saw those tattoos. That how hurt i am that she hid such a big thing from me when we were dating. I don't know if there's anything I can do. I knew it had to end, I had planned a better end by writing a letter.

1okoiyk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okoiyk,Petit Pataud,"Good morning fellow enthusiasts. The decision has been made to sell my 4V BW. It saddens me but I think it’s going to be the right decision. This car has been a dream of mine for awhile. And I have been able to obtain it and am very grateful. But life is life and I need to move on. 

 I bought the car in July of this year and have barely put 2300 miles on it. It is a 2025 Petit Pataud. They are the special edition. 1of50. This one being #6 it has had 2 oil changes already. One free one at the dealer at 1k miles. And the other by myself at 2110 miles. 

The reality is I do not enjoy the car like I thought I would. Don’t get me wrong this is an incredible machine. And I love everything about it. From the way it shifts. To the way it turns heads. To the breath taking sounds it makes when you down shift. It is a head turner everywhere. Especially in this paint combo. The reason I say I don’t enjoy it is because it is anxiety inducing. I can’t get over the fact of how nice the car is. Every time I am behind the wheel I baby it. I’m like the 60 year old corvette owners. Who get their cars outta the garage to cruise to cars and coffee 10 MPH under the speed limit. 

I don’t use this car how GM made it to be used. I will never track it. And I will never romp on it. The truth is I am getting older. And I thought this car would be like how I was in my 20s. Where I just cruise around all the time and work on my car. Well this car needs nothing as it’s perfect as is. So I can’t work on it. And I barely cruise around. With a toddler and a wife I just have no time. 

I would much rather an enthusiast get this car. And drive the hell outta it. That’s what this car deserves.  Ask any questions you may have. 

Im asking 80k OBO. Don’t be afraid to offer. Worst I can say is no. Also if you want more pics. Just ask. I have not had time to even take a proper photo shoot. Which saddens the heck outta me. 

Car is has 20% ceramic tint up front. 5% ceramic in the back. And the car is fully ceramic coated as of August. None smoker. Never seen rain. I would rate it a 10out of 10. It’s pretty much still brand new. I still have some of the plastics on inside. for loan purposes it’s still considered a new vehicle which is nice.

Continued from [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopcraving/comments/1okoeox/the_map_part_1_the_forgery/)...

____

The forgery is folded. The ghost-compass is silent.

And now, this quiet, electric feeling. The feeling of standing at the edge of an unwritten world. The vertigo has settled. The air is clean. But a blank page can be just as intimidating as a prison. Where do you even begin?

You begin not with a pen, but with your senses. The only way to chart the territory is to go *out*, into it.

The first landmark. The taste of coffee this morning. On the old map, it was just a label: ""Fuel."" But here, in this new territory, it was a whole region to be explored. A dark, volcanic range with notes of bitter earth and a river of surprising sweetness running through it. The taste of coffee, a landmark I now map out.

The next discovery, the air on the walk outside. The old map called this ""The In-Between,"" a gray, featureless line connecting two points of interest. But now, it’s a living landscape. I can chart the cool, shaded currents of air under an old oak, and then the open, sun-warmed plains of the sidewalk. These are not just feelings. These are topographic features.

The craving still appears. But it's different now. It’s not a ghost pointing to a ruin. It is a feature of this new territory, something to be charted. It’s a low-lying fog that rolls in from the coast, temporarily obscuring the view.

And when the fog rolls in, a cartographer’s work you begin to do. You don't run from it. You observe it. You map it out. You note its edges, its density, the way the light changes within it. You take a single, deep breath, an anchor point, and chart the clear, clean air that follows in its wake. The act of observing the fog is what makes it recede.

This journey is no longer about what you resist. It is about what you discover. Every new taste, every clean breath, every quiet moment is another landmark placed on your chart. And the new world, you begin to see, is more vibrant and real than the forgery ever promised.

You are not a person who quit something.

You are the cartographer. And the beautiful, intricate, and astonishing map of this new world—you are drawing it, right now, with every breath you take.",1,1761896784.0,stopcraving,0,1.0,False

You walk into the class, everyone’s half-awake, clutching coffee or Red Bull like it’s oxygen. The professor walks in, sometimes chill, sometimes ready to grill you for not knowing your pre-read.

The session begins with a “So who can explain this case?” and suddenly, 70 heads go down, pretending to look for something in their notes. But the professor always knows. 

They’ll call your name anyway, and that’s when you start talking with pure confidence and zero clue (aka **IIM survival instinct**).

Discussions get intense. One student argues for company A, another argues for company B, and soon it’s like a mini boardroom debate. By the end, you realize you learned more from your peers than the slides.

And then there’s the grading part, class participation mar*ks*. You’ll see people raising their hands to say things like *“I agree with what she said, but from a different perspective…”* just to get that extra 0.5 marks.

But jokes aside, it’s exhilarating. Every session pushes you to think critically, defend your ideas, and collaborate under pressure. You walk out mentally exhausted but weirdly fulfilled.

If you’re dreaming of joining an IIM someday, this is what you’re signing up for: caffeine, chaos, and conversations that change the way you think.",2,1761896484.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False

The kind that doesn’t need to be loud to be real. I think I’ve reached that place.

Once upon a time, I was the kind of man who believed in serendipity, that love would appear in a coffee shop corner, or in an unexpected conversation on a train ride. Maybe it still could. But lately, I’ve found myself drawn less to noise and more to meaning. To the rare calm that comes when two people *see* each other, really see.

I’m someone who takes his coffee seriously, believes in handwritten notes, and still thinks good manners are underrated. I come from a world where effort is quiet and taste is timeless, old books, soft jazz, well-crafted sentences, and conversations that unfold like a story.

But beyond the polish, I’m human, a little tired of chasing, a little ready for what’s meant to stay.

I’d love to meet someone emotionally mature, grounded, and self-aware, someone who knows what she wants but isn’t in a hurry to find it. A person who values connection over performance, presence over perfection.

If you’ve also reached that quiet point in life where you’d rather build something slow and real than scroll through endless versions of “almost,” maybe we’ll find a rhythm. Not dramatic, not cinematic, just honest.

And if we don’t, well, I’ll still be that guy sitting by the window, sipping his evening coffee, smiling at how stories find their way when they’re meant to.

I am a lawyer with a creative soul, loves travel, old-world charm, and meaningful company. Not looking for something fleeting, just something honest. :)",1,1761895969.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
1oko8i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oko8i9/the_effervescent_drift/,The Effervescent Drift,"As I throbbed back to my senses, I could only recall the screeching of tires, a burst of white and darkness. The feedback of the monitors reverberated as I felt a  pleasure dichotomous with my state, I then had an overwhelming need to swallow and wasn't able to... I then recalled driving with my little 3 year old Sarah in the back and had to know if they were okay. I scrambled for the call button and frantically clicked on it. As I was clacking away, one of the disheveled nurses came in with a look of concern. ""Hang on dear, you've suffered quite the bonk. Let's see if we can get you settled."" She then called in someone to help her pull out the tube preventing me from finding out how my kid was. I hacked out some bloody phlegm and rasped out ""Sah... SARAH!!!"" After the nurses worriedly looked at each other, they informed me that there were no survivors from my car. I felt a great abyss... like having the floor sink away into a bottomless chasm. I wept as I recalled all of her milestones, as the invisible light of pure and natural expression was forever extinguished. Her grasping my hand as I first held her. Her first word ""hat"". The smell of strawberry shampoo. The way she giggled and waddled away when I chased her with my sock puppet. No more. I failed her. How would I tell Vicki??? She would never forgive me... and yet, I still have to tell her.

I sat at the edge of the bed, ruminating... anticipating how my wife of 5 years would respond to our sudden loss of everything. How can I even present such an awful scenario? I saw the time on my phone was late, and there was one missed call. I reluctantly pulled that number up and held the receiver to the side of my face that wasn't bandaged. The burbling of the ringing tone trailing off made my mind wander as I heard the dreaded crackling of her phone being answered. ""Yeah?"" I must have woke her up. ""Veronica?"" I said shakily. ""Where are you? I tried calling, but nobody answered. I must've dozed off waiting."" As she said this, I started to cry. She responded ""Oh my God! Why are you cry-"" she trailed off. I knew it set in. ""What HAPPENED??? ANWER ME!!!"" she screamed... the scream of a concerned mother on the precipice of giving it her all or giving it up. I couldn't formulate a response. ""WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!!!"" I squelched out a response in my haze of loss while on the brink of being berated: ""I... it came out of nowhere."" I sensed the underlying boiling in the calculating silence. ""What... did... YOU...DO!?!?!?"" This was coming from loss, and I couldn't blame her. I hung up to let her process something that can never be processed while I did the same.

The whole situation was a blur. I was just picking our daughter up from my parent's and must have gotten blindsided. 

I was checked on by a few nurses throughout the night, and one of them commented on how lucky I was to not be paralyzed from the neck down. I tried not to snap at her as a stinging wave of grief washed over me.

I found out the next day while drinking a coffee in my room and watching the news that it was a drunk driver that rear ended me in a lifted pickup. He hit my car going so fast that he basically ramped off of my trunk, flipped, then went on his lid into oncoming traffic. Some stupid fucking uninsured hick without a cent to his name... at least he's dead now. From my ruminating came a voice ""Cold."" I glanced around the room, but couldn't place an origin. Vicki never called to see if I was alright, so I called my parents to pick me up and give her space. As the nurse came in with a wheelchair to help discharge me, I noticed she had an unusual grin. I had to ask. ""Having a good day?"" She stopped grinning, and just stared at me. She said, ""Cold."" Before gesturing to the wheelchair and holding me by the arm to stabilize and transfer me. She continued to address me, ""It's dark down here."" She then kept on, ""To see is to be seen."" I had to ask her what she was talking about, and when I did, she just looked at me like I was crazy. 

My dad came to pick me up. He was sort of heavy set and very bald with a bit of a grouchy disposition. As I got up from the chair and thanked my escort, he came up to me and gave me a hug... I've never really known him to show affection. He whispered in my ear, ""we'll get through this."" My chest started heaving as I hugged him back and cried on his shoulder for the first time I can ever recall. On the ride back, he just stared forward silently with a damp spot on his shoulder where I unleashed my vulnerability. He then checked the rear view mirror and grinned. I looked at his eyes and they were completely black. ""Cold."" He said. I replied ""What?"" He looked back to the road and then at me ""Huh?"" I said ""You just said 'Cold.', what do you mean?"" He claimed he never said anything as we pulled into their garage. ""Your mom made us some lunch if you feel like eating, otherwise, your room is ready if you need some time to rest."" I thanked him, went inside and was put off by the aroma of garlic as I hurriedly hugged my mom and ran to my room, collapsing on my comforter. 

This was wrong. My little Sarah was gone, and here I was... sequestered from everything like a teenager in the very room I grew up in. It should have been me. ""Cold."" I knew I heard it, but it wasn't coming from anywhere. I went to my bathroom to take a shower... maybe I could temporarily forget everything in a cold shower, and this voice was telling me something to help me cope with my loss. I opened the shower and twisted the knob, letting the pitter patter of the shower act as a sort of white noise to help drown out my racing mind. After undressing, I looked in the mirror. I was grinning. Why... was I grinning??? ""Closer."" I heard. I looked closer and saw my eyes darken. ""We have sunk. There is a way back to the effervescence. Let us show you."" I sealed the drain in the tub and began drawing a bath. I felt the surface of the water flittering around my hand... but it wasn't my hand. I didn't recognize any of it. The sensations were far removed, and yet I wasn't numb... just... cold. After the water's surface reached the overflow drain, I got in and submerged completely. The sound of water rushing past my eardrums, my heartbeat. A voice: ""Not yours."" I would normally struggle for breath here, but I felt... complete? A wave of emptiness unfettered by conception crept over me. I let it take me.

We stood over their former vessels, once separate, but now one with us. Their now cold and sticky ichor dripping from our hands, and a pool of blood marking our emergence. Effervescence overflows from us. We returned to the mirror.


We stare into the effervescence that belies the darkness of its origin. Here, darkness is beyond knowing, but not beyond seeing... we see it when the effervescence leaves their eyes and joins ours, and you too can see it as you dissolve into into its vast and all-encompassing mystery. We remain here, gurgling and transisting about. If you join us in this ocean, will you be dragged to the depths, or be lost among the effervescent drift?",1,1761895920.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The sky painted grey and black by the chimneys smoke almost blocking the weak sunlight that was already impeded by the clouds. the streets of the city were plagued by potholes filled with rainwater and its sidewalks crack and crumble like the hopes and dreams of its citizens. People once envied by their neighbors but are now nothing more than the corpse that media vultures gnaw and scrape at to give the world its needed dose of pitifulness. The inhabitants of this city today are called, wilts.
 
The boy, shivering from feeling the cold raindrops slowly invade the cardboard box he slept in, He never questioned the bereft existence of his originators as he understood that had either of them kept him, they would have needed to waste their energy and resources on him. Energy that the boy was quickly losing to the shivering his body produced to prolong his survival. he peeked outside of his box to find anything to eat or at least keep the roof of his box from collapsing. After much deliberation he decided he had to venture out into the cold alleyways of the city to find sustenance. the boy moved from alleyway to alleyway in search of food, something that could get him through one more day.
 
After hours of walking through the grey walls, he found a piece of bread rotting away on the floor. The boy instantly picks It up, but a hand grabs his. Expecting a struggle, he frees himself and runs immediately, only after making sure no one was following him the boy went back to his box and ate his moldy wet carb. The boy thought about what happened and found it strange how no one chased after him. Usually, he would need to endure under a barrage of hits from whoever he stole the food from and only after the aggressor vented his frustration would the boy be allowed to eat. The boy went back to the alleyway, there he discovered an old wrinkly coot lying on the floor right next to where he found the bread. Rain pummeling his failing body as if to force him to the underworld.
 
The boy stared into the old man’s eyes; he knew the wrinkly coot recognized him as the thief who stole his precious bread. Too weak to say or do anything he simply stared back. The boy could sense that death was coming to the old man. The wrinkly coot put his face to the wall and crossed his arms to warm himself. He coughed vehemently and hideously The boy sat across from the old man waiting for an opportunity to obtain the wrinkly coots clothing. He rarely blinked making sure the wrinkly old coot could not run away or attempt to ambush the boy.
The rain continued falling for days but the boy did not waver. The wrinkly old coot would cough and cough until he coughed for one last time and took his last breath.
 
The boy was wary, he did not know if the old man truly died or was only tricking the boy into appearing so. he approached the old wrinkly coot after 2 days passed. he slowly encroached on the old coot’s territory until he was able to flip him over. The old wrinkly coot’s eyes had no life left in them. The boy stripped the old man and was able to warm himself just a tiny bit more.
 
 
 
 
The conditions were harsh for the wretched beggars. Seldom a soul or climate would take pity on them but the ones who were able to survive did so by consuming the weak. Whether it be by stealing, scamming, crying or even murder. Yellow rose did not care for the poor and in return they did not care for civilization.
 
The boy would beg by day and scavenge by night. As a child he was able to squeeze a good amount of money out of the wilts, although this would cause him to be a targeted by other beggars, he learned that by paying a “protection fee” to a gang he could at least keep some of the money. That did not last for long as their greed would ask him to fork over more each time.
He had to adapt and move from street to street but as time marched onwards and the boy became a man, the donations dried up. It got so bad that at some point the man started asking other kids for “protection fees” but then quickly stopped doing it as it left a bad taste in his dehydrated mouth. The man was cunning, so he was able to figure out a way to look even more wretched and pitiful than his fellow beggars. He would take soot from the barrels they used to keep themselves warm and wipe a little over his face specifically his cheeks to make them look even more sunken than before. He also tripped in front of women he found to be naïve and pestered the men he thought were on a date.
 
But his Moby Dick came in a man who was of stout body and wore a suit that didn’t seem expensive at first, but the man was able to surmise that it was of high quality. The stout man would often pass the street he begged on and have a sweeping look upon the beggars. As if to decide who should he give his dirty coins and coffee-stained dollars. The man tried extra hard to catch his attention, he would observe the stout man’s reaction to when he would act as if he fell. He saw him almost want to catch him right then and there. That’s when the man decided that he will push his luck and beg directly. He put on his most wretched look and disgusting smell. And went to hunt his white whale.
 
He started by sleeping on the side of the street that the stout man would walk on, once he saw the man walking down the street, he would squeeze a bit of lemon into his eyes to make them seem as if he was crying. As soon as the stout man saw him, he stopped in his tracks and bent down to talk to him. He rambled about the injustice of the world and how wretched souls like him deserve to be treated like any other, but the man was disinterested and wished he would just give him the money and leave but then the stout man invited him to join him at his estate to wash up and eat a home cooked meal. the man was truly speechless for the first time in his life. Before even being able to reply he simply raised him up by the arm and told him that he will his chauffeur shall pick them up right away. The man suspected something was amiss as he could never imagine such good will would come from his white whale but as soon as he imagined that he could momentarily get away from the cold and destitute streets he had long forgotten what he was worried about.
 
 
shortly a car then came over to pick them up and the man was able to see the faces of envy from the other beggars before entering. He felt prideful almost as if he won against them in battle.
 
The stout man apologized and introduced himself as Blakely Evermore and that he was truly happy from the bottom of his heart that he agreed to his proposition. Soon they would arrive at the evermore estate. A giant manor painted in gold and white stood tall surrounded by colorful flora, the inside of the manor was filled with paintings and impressive sculptures that even the man was able to gawk at. He was speechless for the second time. Due to the Many maids and butlers that served the place it was lively and hectic. It simply felt unreal as if the manor was from a fairy tale. Evermore then asked one of the countless butlers to get him ready for tonight’s dinner as he was the guest of honor. The man was surprised yet again and asked Evermore if what he had was right. Evermore then replied by saying that he doesn’t see any other guests around and laughed loudly.
 
 
The butler then took the man to take a shower first as he wafted a horrible smell. the man entered what could only be described as something alien. He saw a bathroom that was bigger than any room in a homeless shelter. He found shampoos and other liquids that he did not know what their uses were but nonetheless he decided to use all of them by mixing them almost as if he was concocting a potion in his hands.
He turned on the shower and was blasted by cold water but then turned the knob to the other side and almost screamed in agony from its heat. After finishing the shower another butler then came and started cutting his long messy hair and shave his beard. They gave him a suit to wear not unlike the ones the butlers wore. The man looked in the mirror and saw someone unrecognizable. He touched his face and went through his hair as if to confirm that it truly was him. The butler then announced to the man that dinner is ready and that he should prepare to meet Evermore at the dining room.
 
As he was guided to the dining room, the man thought to himself about how he wishes this day would never end. That he could stay this version of himself and never go back to who he was. The man racked his brain trying to think of a way to prolong his day of heaven. And after much deliberation he decided to ask the butler if he thinks Evermore would allow him to work with them as a butler. The butler stopped dead in his tracks for a moment. A moment with an incredibly eerie silence. After what felt like an eternity the butler then said they have arrived and opened the dining hall doors.
 
 
 
He entered a room only lit by a fireplace. It was wider than it was long. A very lengthy wooden dining table spanned the entire mid-section. And directly facing the door was the taxidermized head of a pig with an apply in its mouth. Evermore saw the man and loudly exclaimed that he could barely recognize him and that he should take a seat before the food gets cold.
 
The man sat down at the end with his back to the fireplace with evermore sitting at the other end. Evermore told the man to dig in and started eating the steak that was served. He also emphasized that he should the drink the red wine as it came directly from their vineyard.
The man took a gulped down almost the entire drink and then started choking. He then took a deep breath and Thanked Evermore for his hospitality. He then said that he wouldn’t doesn’t want to enjoy such niceties without repaying him and that he would love it if he could work as a butler in his manor.
 
Evermore laughed louder than ever before.
Longer than ever before.
So long in fact that the man started getting uncomfortable.
The pieces of steak were flying out from Evermore’s mouth as his uncontained laughter escaped his chest.
After calming himself down with the red wine. He apologized for the boorish behavior and that he could not help himself.
He then asked the man if he knew what wagyu beef was.
The man couldn’t answer him.
Evermore continued eating the steak with even more vigor while explaining that Wagyu is a type of cow that is treated with the utmost care and hospitality, fed with food that is far beyond what any other livestock could dream of, and that they even gave them frequent baths and massages to keep their stress levels low. it can even be considered royalty among all cows and pigs. The man asked what this had to do with him getting a job, but evermore quickly shut him down by saying that he should not interrupt people when they speak.
He continued saying that had they let these cows out in the open they would have lived a long life but never tasted the joys of life that humanity could give them.
The man finally realized the horrors that were unfolding. He looked at the steak with incredible disgust.
Evermore then thanked the man for drinking the wine so quickly otherwise he might have had a conversation with his food and that it always gave him a stomachache.
The man stood up quickly trying to escape but alas it was too late.
His vision started blurring slowly and he could hear Evermore ask the butlers to start make sure they prepare tomorrows dinner.

Crazy idea.** *Been thinking of Converting our corner unit condo in Tomas Morato, QC to a Co-Working Space + Coffee.*

Been trying to sell the unit but to no Avail. My wife is a VA, and I am a University Professor.

We are also trying to learn barista / coffee making as we are generating this crazy idea.

I know there's a lot of Coffee Shops nearby, but co-working spaces feels like an extension of your working space and your home. Minsan, nakakahiya magtagal sa mga coffee shops or minsan sobrang ingay kasi random yung crowd.

The unit has a good view, from the range of Antipolo Mountains until Manila Bay. Located 29th Floor.

Our target is limited to a closed network of VAs only, to maintain the identity of the unit as a co-working space.

These are our target inclusions and must-haves

\- Wifi

\- Toiletries

\- Free Water \[Filtered Water\]

\- Small Meals

\- Snacks

\- Napping Area for 1 person

\- Airconditioning during operational hours

\- Common TV

\- \*whatever is necessary\*

Max capacity of the room is for **8 pax only**; Shared Tables / Solo Tables Facing the Window

Target amount is 300-350 per day; Bookings will be reserved and calendared to secure a table and spot. Coffee will be served to our best creation :)

Here is how our unit look like (For Reference; Remove the Big Bed and Big Couch hehe)

It's an L-Shaped Corner Unit Condo; Almost twice the size of a Studio Unit Condo.  
Note: No Parking; But there are paid parking spots nearby

Funny thing is, we barely hear each other when we're inside the unit; I think its an advantage for those having calls? hehe

If you have a good time to read this, we would be very much open to ideas and criticisms! **Are we crazy or not? hehe.**

And if you're a VA interested in working in a place like this, please let us know!

Metal met flesh in a relentless rhythm. A dim light flickered overhead, casting a pale glow on the concrete walls, which were streaked with blood. The air was thick with the smell of iron, sweat, and something chemical, sweet and medicinal.

 Victor stood in the center of the room. He was wearing a white lab coat, clean despite the brown stains, and thin gloves that hugged his fingers to the point of transparency. His movements were measured, almost graceful. On the couch is a man in his early forties, wearing an expensive shirt, now torn and soaked in blood. Metal clamps held the body in unnatural immobility.

Victor straightened up, wiped his forehead, and made a short note in his notebook. Then he picked up the hammer again and continued.
Each blow echoed loudly in the walls. The muscles on Victor's face remained motionless. He didn't seem to be hitting, but watching. He was not interested in suffering, but in a pattern. How bones break, how blood changes color, how long a human body can exist without ceasing to feel pain.

Forty minutes later, the body was a tangle of torn tissues. But the man was still alive, his eyes darting, his breath coming in short gasps. The hallucinogens made him see things that weren't there: a house, a wife, children, and a warm sun. And then there was Victor. Impassive, eternal. In that moment, time ceased to exist for both of them.

 When it was over, Victor removed the instrument and looked at his watch. The victim's heart had stopped. He noted with slight displeasure that the time was shorter than he had anticipated.
He placed the body in a black bag and carried it to the adjacent room, a metal cylinder that served as his homemade crematorium. The flames eagerly accepted another victim. Fifteen minutes later, all that remained was a gray-white dust. Victor carefully collected it in a jar and labeled it:
Experiment #47.

 There were more than fifty such jars on the shelf.

 He turned off the lights. Silence returned to the room like an old friend.

⸻

Half an hour later, Victor was walking down the street as if nothing had happened. The city was going about its business—people were laughing, cars were honking, the air smelled of coffee and gasoline. He stopped at a shop window, straightened his collar.
Everything about him spoke of calmness: his step, his gaze, the precision of his movements.

He bought rice, soy sauce, and chocolate. At the checkout, he smiled—kindly, gently, as he could. No one would have guessed that his fingers had held a hammer just an hour ago.

⸻

At home, he was greeted by children—small, warm, and alive. The girl hugged her neck, the boy hung on her arm. Victor picked them both up and laughed.
His wife was standing in the doorway. Her smile was tired but sincere. The house smelled of fish and butter.
They had dinner with a quiet movie, then cleared the table together. Victor put the children to bed, adjusted the blankets, and closed the door. Everything looked like a perfect life.

In the bedroom, he paused at the bedside table. There was a chess board on it. The white knight moved forward slowly. Victor looked at the board for a few seconds, as if trying to remember the position of the pieces. Then he went to bed.

⸻

Morning. The clock showed eight. Breakfast, coffee, a quick kiss.
Two hours later, he was standing backstage at the concert hall. The lights from the stage were blinding, and the noise of the crowd was like a crashing wave. Victor checked his tie and looked in the mirror. His face was flawless.

He stepped onto the stage.
In front of him was a sea of faces. Applause, flashes of cameras.
He spoke with confidence, measured, with the right pauses and the right intonation. His speech, honed to the last breath, sounded like music.
He spoke about honor, justice, a country without corruption and pain. People shouted his name.

 After the speech, he descended from the stage and left through the back door. In the silence of the corridor, only the hum of blood in his ears. He knew: everything was going according to plan.

⸻

Two months later, Victor became president.

 Newspapers were full of headlines:
“Hope for a revival”,
“A man who is believed”,
“The president of the future”.

Victor sat in his new office. Huge windows, an oak desk, portraits on the walls. Everything seemed foreign. On the monitor in front of him – graphs, reports, budgets. But his thoughts were not about power.

He was building another empire. Not a political one. He was seeking power over matter itself.

 Victor set up dozens of meetings, gathering the best engineers, physicists, and programmers. Under the guise of a technological breakthrough, he created a project called ""Physical Artificial Intelligence."" A machine capable of controlling not just data, but reality itself.

⸻

The first months were a routine of reports, blueprints, and meetings. But Victor barely slept. The same sparkle gradually appeared in his eyes —not human, but mathematical.

He went down to the lab at night. White sterile halls, the sound of filters, the faint smell of ozone. The scientists could hardly hide their alarm: their president came unguarded, in a simple robe, silently watched, took notes. Sometimes he wrote something on the walls. Formulas. They're weird, they don't make sense.

One day, he stopped in front of a mirror and stared at his reflection for a long time. His own face seemed foreign to him, like a mask he was used to. He realized that he had stopped noticing the expressions in other people's eyes. Everyone had become the same. Everyone was just a piece of material.

⸻

A year.
Hundreds of experiments.
Billions of dollars spent.

 And now, the result.

 A massive metal monolith in the center of the laboratory. A heart surrounded by cables, emitting a soft, vibrating hum. Victor stood in front of him, his hands trembling.
The machine was breathing.

 He typed the first command:
""Create an apple in my hand.""

 The air around his hand rippled like water. The apple appeared. It was real. He squeezed it, feeling its warmth and inhaling its scent. He took a bite and froze. It was sweet. It tasted like childhood. It tasted like something he had lost.

 He stood there for several minutes, staring into nothingness. There was something like tears in his eyes.

Then he told everyone to leave.
The door closed. The room was empty. There was silence. Only the hum of the machine and his breathing.

 He sat in front of the keyboard.
His fingers moved slowly, as if in a ritual.

 ""Let no one die again.
Let every person be immortal.
But let no one lose the ability to feel pain.
Let her remain, alive and unrelenting.
Let no one become accustomed to her.
Let every second of life be a torment,
let every cell of the body remember suffering.
Let the suffering rise like waves,
endlessly, immeasurably, without end.
Let the world know no death,
only the eternal torture of existence.
Let there be no release,
no sleep, no end, no peace.
Let everyone live forever.
And let everyone suffer forever.""

He stopped. He sat still for a few seconds. There were no thoughts in his head. Only a sense of completion.

 He took the gun out of the drawer, opened the slide, and put it to his temple. The metal was cold.

 He clicked the key.
Enter.

 He fired the gun.

I kindly ask you to read my story to the end.

My name is Pavlo, and I never imagined that one day I would be the one asking for help.
All my life, I’ve helped others, supported my loved ones, and tried to stay strong.
But now I find myself in a situation I can no longer handle alone.

I was born in Ukraine. My childhood seemed normal, but as I grew older, I began to understand that my family was struggling much more than I realized.
Eventually, I made the difficult decision to leave Ukraine and go abroad to support my parents financially.
I moved to the Czech Republic. At first, life was incredibly hard — I didn’t know the language, had no friends, and felt completely alone.
But over time, I found a job, and things slowly started to improve.

That’s when I met the woman who would later become my wife.
We worked together, supported each other, and dreamed of a simple, happy life — a small house, a cup of coffee in the yard, and children playing nearby.
I continued helping my parents and brother back in Ukraine as much as I could.
When we got married, I felt like the happiest man in the world.

Then the war in Ukraine began. My wife and I decided to help the army in any way we could — with medicine, donations, and volunteering.
Everything we earned, we sent to help others. When there wasn’t enough money but our soldiers urgently needed something, we took out loans to buy and send the supplies.

Then tragedy struck — my brother was seriously injured in the war and needed urgent medical treatment.
We didn’t have enough savings, so I took out a large loan of $50,000.
In total, I ended up taking ten different loans to cover medical and humanitarian expenses.

Later, my wife lost her job, and shortly after — I lost mine too.
Without any income, we could no longer keep up with the payments.
Everything started to fall apart, and now our marriage is on the verge of collapse.

I am 42 years old, and I often find myself crying — broken by fear, despair, and the pain of losing everything I love.
We always dreamed of having children, but now we can’t even think about it — we are drowning in debt.
Our total debt is now over $180,000.
We are both working again, but it’s nowhere near enough to escape this hole.
The situation is critical.

🙏 If you can help — even with a small donation — please, help us save our family.
If you can’t, I completely understand. Please, just share our story with others.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for reading.
May God protect you and all people in this world. 💛

Manali has always been a favourite honeymoon spot — but if you’re visiting soon (especially this winter), there’s a lot more to experience beyond the usual Mall Road and Solang Valley.

If you’re coming for a romantic winter honeymoon, the best time is **late December to February** for snow-covered landscapes and cozy stays. For couples who prefer clear skies and scenic drives, **March to May** is perfect.

For stays, find the hotels with mountain views, and with private balconies (amazing for morning coffee scenes)

Romantic spots to add to your list:

* **Sissu via Atal Tunnel** – snow paradise in winter.
* **Jana Waterfall** – short scenic drive with cute cafes.
* **Hamta Valley** – stunning backdrops for photos and picnics.
* **Manu Temple Trail** – perfect for a quiet walk together.

And if you’re up for something special, a **snow pre-wedding or couple shoot** in Solang or Sissu looks straight out of a Bollywood movie! 

Whether you’re after snow, silence, or scenic romance, Manali has a way of making every couple fall in love all over again. ",1,1761894465.0,desitravellers,1,1.0,False

I love penguins, but I picked the Shiba calendar over the yearly penguin calendar. My usual coffee mug is a SeaWorld or NYPD Mug. 

I like comedy and action, TV shows and movies. I enjoy playing video games and watching anime, mostly I listen to LitRPG audio books. I enjoy a vast variety of music especially City Pop, Classic Rock, Irish Punk, Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Buffet, Viza and Reggae. Three of my favorite movies are Kung Fu Hustle, Blazing Saddles, and The Blues Brothers


 Most of my video games are single-player, but I’m open to trying multiplayer if you’re on Steam, especially if you play fallout 76.
  
Games I like: Borderlands 1&2, Dave the Diver, Skyrim, Yakuza 0, GTA Vice City, Sleeping Dogs, Fallout 76, Hogwarts legacy.

Anime I like: The GetBackers, Dr. Stone, The Way of the Househusband, Record of Ragnarok, Cells at Work, Cells at Work code black, Thermae Romae Novae, Delicious in Dungeon, and Mashle.

1oknrm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1oknrm4/my_mother_emailed_me/,My mother emailed me,"I've been NC for a year. My mother emailed me yesterday to let me know my grandmother's died. I just need to vent and have no one to talk to about this. 

Perhaps I was naive to think she'd respect my boundaries and leave me alone. She's violated my boundaries all my life, so I don't know why I'm surprised. I just thought she understood there is no reason to ever contact me. 

And I didn't know my grandmother. She was abusive, I last saw her when I was 5, I don't care about that woman and my mother knows that. And there are other family members who could've easily let me know. So I truly don't know why this was necessary. 

About a month ago I received a whatsapp message from my mother that I suspect was supposed to look accidental, but really wasn't. She could see that I'd read it, of course. I think that was the goal. Or perhaps she was hoping I'd respond. I immediately blocked her. I also suspect she sent one of her enablers to talk to me – who I ignored. She also somehow added herself to my netflix – suddenly my mother's name was there.  

And now this. I know she didn't kill her mother or plan this in any way. But I can't help but think she's used her mother's death as an opportunity to contact me. 

The email is characteristically passive aggressive. At first I felt numb, then I cried, now all I feel is anger. I'm just furious. I've accepted she doesn't want to be a mother, as she's told me numerous times. I understand that she's parentified me, that she wants me to be her mother. 

All I ask now is to be left alone. I can't comprehend why that's too much to ask.

She says it's 'unpleasant' that she has to let me know like this. But 'it is what it is'. 

And for a moment, for maybe a few hours, I felt like I had to take care of her. Like I had to check on her. 

And oh my god, fuck. off. It makes me so angry she somehow still managed to make me feel that way. She has never cared about telling me any good or bad information in an appropriate, considerate way. Not when I was 3, not when I was 30. Often, she hasn't cared about telling me at all. Including when any family member has died. My feelings have never mattered. But suddenly, that's changed. And she has to mention me going NC is what prevents her from telling me in an appropriate way. 

This is her mother who's died, and she's not emailing for me, because she cares about me knowing, cares about my feelings. She's purely emailing for herself. She wants pity, comfort, and control.

When my dad died, and I was about to be told, she ordered me to make coffee for everyone. I obeyed. I was then yelled at for making coffee, and told to sit down. None of this was out of the ordinary, but what a moment to do it in. This is how she prepared her daughter for receiving that horrible news. When I collapsed onto the floor, she played the part of the concerned mother very well, while everyone was watching. As soon as they weren't, she smiled. Two broken daughters in shock, and a sadistic mother smiling on the sofa. 

Then followed a period of horrific abuse – which was only able to happen because I was grieving so much it made me incredibly vulnerable. I was an easy target. She used my grief against me, and used it to call me insane, abusive, she DARVO'd me. Not one apology. For that, or for any of the abuse. 

About two years ago my grandfather on my dad's side died. I found out two months later when my mother said 'the inheritance is coming, by the way'. She knew I don't talk to any family. She knew I didn't know. I had to ask what she was talking about and she told me like she was talking about the weather. 

So fuck her for pretending to care about telling me this news in the right way. 

Maybe it's because I haven't had to deal with her bullshit in a year that I'm appalled, outraged. And I think it's a good thing that I feel this way. I've been learning to expect to be treated so, so, so much better. With love, kindness. I'm learning that I'm safe now. I'm learning to expect that when I set a very clear boundary, it's respected. 

I also think it's good news that I'm angry at her for taking up any more of my time & energy. For 30+ years, I never got angry about her or anyone wasting my time. The pendulum has swung the other way, and at least for now I can't stand any abusive people taking up any of my time. I can't stand anyone wasting my time, period. 

I've got a life to live, I've got to reparent myself, take care of myself. I want to focus on joy, love, art, the right people, taking care of myself. And I'm allowed to choose that for myself. 



I didn't think I'd have to block my mother everywhere. But if that's how it has to be, fine.

Here's the exact workflow that gave them their life back.**

## The Breaking Point

Picture this: Every morning at 8 AM, Sarah would grab her coffee and start the dreaded ritual. Copy order from Shopify. Paste into shipping software. Copy tracking number back. Update customer via email. Rinse and repeat for 30-50 orders daily.

""I felt like a human copy-paste machine,"" she told me. ""I got into e-commerce to build something, not to be a data entry clerk.""

## The n8n Solution That Changed Everything

Here's the beautiful workflow that automated her entire process:

**Node 1: Shopify Trigger** - Listens for ""order paid"" webhook
**Node 2: Set Node** - Structures order data with `{{ $json.line_items.map(item => item.title).join("", "") }}` to create clean product lists
**Node 3: ShipStation Node** - Auto-creates shipment using `{{ $node[""Set""].json.customer_address }}` for shipping details
**Node 4: Wait Node** - Gives ShipStation 2 minutes to generate tracking
**Node 5: ShipStation Node** - Fetches tracking number with `{{ $json.shipments[0].trackingNumber }}`
**Node 6: Shopify Node** - Updates order fulfillment status
**Node 7: Gmail Node** - Sends customer notification: ""Hi {{ $node[""Shopify Trigger""].json.customer.first_name }}, your order {{ $node[""Shopify Trigger""].json.name }} is on its way!""

## The Game-Changing Results

✅ **10 hours saved weekly** (2 hours × 5 days)
✅ **Zero copy-paste errors** (previously 2-3 weekly)
✅ **Customers get tracking within 5 minutes** (was 24-48 hours)
✅ **99.8% automation success rate**

The best part? Sarah built this in one afternoon using n8n's visual interface. No developer needed.

## Key n8n Insights You Can Steal

**Smart Error Handling**: She added an IF node checking `{{ $json.shipments && $json.shipments.length > 0 }}` before sending tracking emails.

**Dynamic Content**: Using `{{ $now.format('MMMM Do') }}` in emails makes them feel personal: ""Your order shipped on January 15th!""

**Webhook Magic**: The Shopify webhook ensures instant triggering - no polling delays eating up operations.

## Your Automation Opportunity

This same pattern works for:
- Order processing + inventory updates
- Support tickets + Slack notifications  
- Lead capture + CRM sync + email sequences
- Invoice generation + payment tracking

The beauty is n8n's node ecosystem - swap Shopify for WooCommerce, ShipStation for Easyship, Gmail for Mailgun. Same logic, different tools.

The kind of place where people pay $5,000,000 for a house they see twice a year. I’ve never really felt comfortable here. I don’t ski, snowboard, or do coke, so I’m kind of an outcast by choice. My dad owns a property management company, so he makes sure that all the vacation homes are perfect year-round. The grass is green, the paint is fresh—I mean, some of these places don’t even have tire marks on their driveways. Safe to say, he’s good at his job.

My mom passed away in a hit-and-run incident when I was 10, so it’s just us now. I know it’s been hard on my dad, having to pick up the slack around the house, so I try to help him with whatever I can—taking out the garbage, cleaning the house, etc. But I know the hardest part for him is knowing she’s gone. Every once in a while, I see him show it, though he hides it well.

“Come on, Maddie, finish your breakfast. I’ve got to stop by the Martins’ before I drop you off at school,” her dad says, sipping his coffee and grabbing his keys.

“Okay, Dad,” Maddie replies, casually finishing the last of her bacon. She grabs her bag and heads out the door, sliding into the passenger seat of the truck. It’s just another normal morning, nothing out of the ordinary.

They drive quietly for a few minutes, the radio playing softly in the background. As they pull up to the Martins' house, her dad glances at the house before stepping out. “I’ll be right back,” he says, walking up the porch steps. Maddie doesn't pay much attention, scrolling through her phone as she waits.

Her dad knocks on the door, but no one answers. Without hesitation, he pulls a thick envelope from his jacket and leaves it neatly on the doorstep before turning back to the truck. Maddie barely notices as he gets back in.

“Alright, let’s get you to school,” her dad says, starting the engine again. 

“Sure,” Maddie replies absentmindedly, already thinking about the day ahead. The truck rolls away from the house, and soon they’re back on the main road. For Maddie, it’s just another typical morning.








Chapter 2



Welcome to park city high 



Monday at PCH. Ugh, the worst day. Everybody runs around with way too much enthusiasm, acting as if they haven’t seen each other in years, telling stories about the lavish things they did over the weekend. Things like, *in a posh voice*, ""Father took my whole family horseback riding through the canyon,"" or ""We spent the whole day shopping in Salt Lake."" And there I am with, ""Me and my dad cleaned the gutters out for the Richmonds."" It doesn’t quite impress the masses here, but I have a couple of friends. There’s Jessica Vonhuff—I call her Jess—and Michael Prince. He’s the son of the richest man in Park City, like the kind of rich that could buy and sell all of the popular kids' parents. I met him when I was a kid, and we’ve been best friends since day one.

""Look out, it’s the loser of Park City High, Maddie Sloan,"" a popular girl says as she passes by.

“Don’t listen to her. She’s just mad because her dad took her car away after she got caught alone with her boyfriend,” Michael says.

“Hey, nice nose job. Maybe now Derek will give you another chance,” Jess adds.

That’s every morning. Annie McQueen is the stereotypical mean girl. She gets what and whoever she wants—except Michael. She’s tried, oh man, she’s tried, but he wouldn’t touch her. He’s not into girls like that.
The bell rings. “I’m late!”


Chapter 3

Mrs. Martin

Running through the halls, trying to make it to Mrs. Martin’s first-period history class. She usually is late herself, on account of late nights at the No Name Saloon. I sneak in, undetected, to my seat in the back right corner by the window so I can see outside and dream about anywhere but here. I turn to my right to get my notebook out of my backpack—SLAM! Suddenly, I’m face-to-face with Mrs. Martin, and she does not look happy to see me.

“Hi,” I say shakily, trying to compose myself.

“Hi? Hi? Is that all you have to say for yourself? You are 2 minutes and 38 seconds late. 2 minutes and 38 seconds can be the difference between life and death,” she snaps.

You might think that’s a weird thing to hear from a teacher, but not Mrs. Martin. She’s as mean as a rattlesnake and twice as venomous. I could actually smell the alcohol on her breath from the night before.

“Open your history books to page 64.”



Chapter 4

Lunchtime


I’d rather die than eat this.

Phew, I made it to lunch. Hopefully, we’re not having—*SPLAT*—“meatloaf.” Just my luck, the worst they’ve got. At least it’s hot, I guess. I look across the room for my friends and spot Michael sitting with… wait, is that Annie McQueen?

“Oh hey, Madds, what’s up? I heard Mrs. Martin tore you a new one in history,” Michael says.

“I’m getting out of here before anyone sees me,” Annie huffs as she leaves.

“What was that?” I ask, confused.

“Oh, that was nothing. She just wanted to know if we could have a party at my place because her parents canceled her birthday party after catching her with Zach.”

“Zach? I thought she was with Derek?”

“Exactly,” he says, raising his eyebrows suggestively.

Right then, everyone runs to the window as an ambulance drives up to the door by the teachers' lounge.

“Hey, what’s everyone staring at?” Jess says from behind us.

“There’s an ambulance outside. Where have you been? Lunch started 10 minutes ago.”

“Oh, I-I was in the bathroom,” she stutters.

“We have no idea what’s happening,” I say.

Just then, a paramedic opens the door, pushing a body out. 

“Oh God, who, what, happened?” a murmur spreads across the crowd. 

It was Mrs. Martin.

Chapter 5


Do They Think I Did It?



**BEEP*—a voice over the intercom. “Students, due to the events that have occurred, we will be canceling school for today. Also, Maddie Sloan, please come to the principal’s office.”

The whole crowd turns to me as if I did something. As I walk to the principal’s office, I keep thinking about what Mrs. Martin said to me earlier: “life and death… life and death.” Eerie words.

“Hi, I’m Maddie Sloan, her—”

“Come in here, Miss Sloan,” Principal Powers says in his deep, gravelly voice. “There are some officers here to speak to you about the incident that happened earlier in Mrs. Martin’s classroom.”

They ask some simple questions about my relationship with Mrs. Martin and if I had anything they needed to know.

“Like what? She was my teacher. Yeah, she was mean, but not just to me.”

They ask if there was anyone who may have wanted to hurt her.

“No! Sure, she was mean and scary, but not enough to kill.”

Then they ask if I knew Mr. Martin. The officer used past tense. I guess it never occurred to me that there was a Mr. Martin.

“No, I’ve never met him. Why?”

“He’s missing too.”




Chapter 6



A Witness with Bad Eyes



Mrs. Martin dead, Mr. Martin missing—crazy. I can’t believe it. *Honk honk!* I see my dad here to pick me up.

“Hey hun, are you okay? I came as soon as I heard.”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Just a crazy day. I just need to lay down and rest, I think.”

On the drive home, I can’t stop thinking about it. Could Mr. Martin have done it? Mr. Martin, who until today, I didn’t even know existed? *VvvVvv*—a text from Jess.

“You ok? Me and Michael are headed to your place now.”

“No, I need to lay down. Later?”

I hit the door, go straight upstairs, and start to research. The banner on KSL News reads, *Mark Martin, currently a person of interest in wife’s death, missing. Victim or culprit?* So I search for Mark Martin and pull up an article from 6 years ago, saying he was the witness in a hit-and-run that resulted in a death. It was my mom. He saw the person who hit my mom, but it says he couldn’t recall anything specific about the suspect, and nothing ever came of his account. *Ding dong*—Michael and Jess are at the door.

“Come on up, guys. I’m in my room.”

“Hey, are you okay?”

“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. Did you know there was a Mr. Martin and that he was a witness to my mother’s death?”

“No.” “No,” they both said assuredly.

“There’s got to be something to that, right?”

“Are you okay?” Michael said.

“Yeah, Maddie, you’re talking crazy, kinda,” Jess adds.

“Yes, I’m fine, but I have an idea. Do you trust me?”

“Sure,” they said.

“We’re going to check out the Martins' house.”






Chapter 7 


Sorry Dad, Gotta Go




“No, I draw the line at breaking and entering,” Michael said.

“Who said anything about that?” I replied as I jingled some keys. “My dad waters their plants when they’re away.”

“Sounds fun and not really illegal,” Jess said with a wicked smile.

“Okay, let’s go,” Michael agreed.

We rushed downstairs too fast to even hear my dad say anything.

“Bye, Dad. I’ll be at Jess’s! Go, go, go,” I whispered urgently.

Pulling up to the Martins’ place was eerie. Crime scene tape was everywhere, but there were no cops to be seen. I pulled out the keys, but the door was already ajar.

“Odd,” Michael said, visibly scared but trying to hide it. “C’mon, let’s start searching.”

The place was trashed—papers scattered everywhere, drawers emptied out—but nothing that gave us any clues. Then I noticed a slightly askew floorboard.

“Michael, let me see your knife,” I said.

“What makes you think I have one?” he replied defensively.

“Because you’re a boy, duh.”

“I find that—”

“Here, use mine,” Jess interrupted, handing me a knife. “Wussie,” she aimed at Michael.

I pried the board up, and out fell a USB stick.

“Quick, give me a computer.”

“Here,” Michael said as he pulled a laptop from his backpack.

“Oh, that you have,” Jess teased.

Just then, we heard a slight creak in the floor. Could someone else be here?

“Quick, hide,” I whispered.










Chapter 8


Intruders vs. Intruder




I’m crouched behind the couch, heart hammering in my chest, as Jess quietly navigates the Martin’s computer. A video file opens, and there on the screen, in the grainy footage, is the silhouette of a man with the Martins. Money changes hands, but the figure’s face is frustratingly indistinct.

“Could that be him?” Michael whispers, his voice barely audible.

I squint, trying to find any recognizable feature. The mystery person could be anyone.

A floorboard groans somewhere in the dark house, snapping us back to the present. We’re not alone. Panic flares up as we exchange wide-eyed looks.

Jess hits a key, and the screen goes black just as a shadow flickers at the edge of my vision. We scramble for a hiding place, jumping behind the curtains, hearts racing. This just got a lot more complicated. We’re huddled together, barely daring to breathe. The shadowy figure creeps closer, and I can almost feel their presence on the other side of the curtain. My heart is a wild drumbeat in the silence.

Then, a phone rings somewhere in the house, piercing the stillness. The figure stiffens, and for a moment, I’m sure we’re done for. But then, they turn and hurry away, footsteps fading fast.

Once we’re sure they’re gone, we emerge from our hiding spot. That’s when I see it—a worn leather wallet lying forgotten on the floor. I exchange a look with Michael and Jess. Could it be a clue?

We approach it slowly, as if it might disappear or explode. I flip it open, and there’s an old photo, edges frayed and the image faded. It’s a family picture, and I recognize the younger version of my dad, his arm around a woman I don’t know, and a kid who’s about my age.

My mind races. Is this a clue about the intruder’s identity, or just a random lost item? It feels important, but it’s not enough to be sure.

“What do you think? Could this wallet be the key to unlocking everything?”

More like…
the sun sneaking past a careless curtain,

warm, uninvited,
but suddenly, you can’t imagine the room without it.

She didn’t try to be found.
She was just there.
In a laugh,
in a pause,
in the kind of silence
that somehow says stay.

And for a second —
maybe longer —
everything else just… stopped.
Noise, plans,
the weight of what’s next —
it all faded.

I wouldn’t even call it luck.

Hello women of  reddit india. I'm not sure if this is gonna turn out to be much, I am doing this spur of the moment. I am going to be asking a girl out that I've met at my coaching. We have a lot of things in common, and often walk to the metro together. She doesn't seem to hate me?

So I am thinking of asking her out today, but not sure what would be the best approach? On one hand-

I am considering cards on the table, straight up telling her (shortening it for the sake of the post) that ""I seem to have developed a crush and its been fun talking and getting to know her. I don't expect anything from her but it felt disingenuous to not tell her how I've been feeling. So if she doesn't hate the idea completely, I would like to go out with her sometime. Either way she can let me know her answer over text""

Or 

Be casual and laid back, just ask her if ""she's free today or can make some time at any point in the coming week to grab brunch or a coffee or something. Because I would like to hang out with her/spend more time with her. If that's okay?""

I can't decide because in my opinion while first approach is fairly direct but also gives her space to think and no pressure to answer immediately. While the other approach being laid back makes me seem less intense?

1okngvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianEntrepreneur/comments/1okngvh/most_finance_tools_felt_too_complicated_so_i/,"Most finance tools felt too complicated, so I built one you can talk to.","Hey, everyone  
  
A few months ago, I realized I was bad at keeping track of my finances. I had income from internships, freelance projects, hackathons, and random expenses like domain names, cloud services, traveling or weekend outings. Spreadsheets got messy, and most finance tools felt too formal; they were made for accountants or teams, not for individuals trying to stay organized. 



So, I decided to build something for myself. It turned into ExpenFlow, a tool that helps you track and manage finances using your voice or natural language. You can simply say something like, ""Add ₹300 for coffee meeting yesterday,"" and it logs the entry automatically. 

It also works with receipts and bank statements, processing them securely on our server —no third-party uploads or data sharing. 

Who it’s really for: 

Solopreneurs, freelancers, or anyone juggling multiple income sources and personal expenses. These are people who want to stay on top of their money without spending hours every week on it.



What I’ve learned: 

Finance tools don’t need to be complex; they just need to be intuitive. 

Privacy matters more than most people realize. 

Building for yourself first often leads to something others find useful too.   


I’d love to know—how do you all keep track of your personal or side-hustle finances today? Would you actually use something voice-powered for it, or do you still prefer spreadsheets and manual methods?

I was on my way into work, while talking on the phone to my girlfriend. I decided to go into McDonalds and get an ice coffee. I parked the car and popped in my earbuds to continue the conversation. As I walked onto the sidewalk leading to the entrance of the restaurant I see a woman with a clip board, l also see a man leaving the front entrance and walking towards me, where right after we cross paths the woman stopped me and asked,
""excuse me sir, did you and that man just have sexual relations in front of my eyes just now?"" To which I said ""you mean that man that just walked out of McDonalds that I never seen before in my life?"" 
Pointing to the man who was just about to enter his truck. ""Yes"" she said, ""you're asking if me and that man I never seen before had sex right in front of you magically?"" Said I, ""yes"" she said again with a look that seemed so sure upon her. I said, ""listen lady, I don't have time for this fucking bullshit"" in a tone the way a New Yorker may mean it, not mean but just truthful. 
Putting my hand up to shush her as she started speaking to me again but l having started to walk away that cause her to run after the man, who was now in his car with the window down and I could hear the woman asking him the same question. He just shook his head as if he was tired of this bullshit too, already early in the day and drove off. Inside I was greeted by both the manager who seem young and kind goofy type of manager, you know the cool ones and his coworker, a young man as well. I retold my story to the two, the manager stocked and wondering said ""what?"" And his coworker ""it's that woman who was in here the other day, tweaking out in the corner!"" 
The manager goes to look out the door, stepping out when the coworker looked at square in the eyes and said ""sir! Are you alright?
Did you feel threatened? Do you want me to call the police?"" Before I could answer he again said ""say yes"". I did say yes to him, I being now shocked in the moment of how crazy life can seem, he calls the police to have her trespassed. The manager coming back in and wanted to know what is going on to which ""he felt threatened and wanted me to call the police!"" Coworker. 
The manager with a look of fake shock at what clearly wasn't just a coworker but his friend outside of work.

 I met a women on tinder who is originally from singapore. I'm from the Midwest and so was she (11 miles away). The first thing that happens is she asks me for a Whatsapp?

I know....obvious scam already
So I say I don't have a whatsapp, do you have an Instagram or Facebook. She said she has both. So we followed each other on Instagram and started talking.

Her Instagram and facebook, very vague, pictures match up but not much followers or activity and has only posted 5 times for a 2 month period. Not the biggest red flag but my suspicions rose higher.

As we were talking through the day I raised my concerns about her being a scammer. I asked if I could video chat, she actually said sure. I started a video chat almost immediately (didn't want to give time to set up an alias), and sure enough there she is alive in the flesh with a beautiful accent conversating like normal people for a brief 5 minutes.

At this point I'm surprised, maybe I'm just overthinking? Well we were still texting afterwards before I even asked if we could meet she said she is on a business trip for one month to the U.K. Great how convenient...

Then I made known to her that I would love to go jogging and take her out for coffee. Then she asked if I would promise her to take her when she gets back? (OK here's where I get the scammer) I answered with of course, just promise me one thing, please do not ask me for money or links until we meet, you know for scamming concerns? Guess what?

She promised me and said she would never ask money from me and she has money. Uhh wow....

At this point I'm starting to be more seriously invested. As I'm posting today, we've been Instagram chatting for 3 days throughout hours of the day, it would usually be between 10 -15 minutes before i get a response sometimes but it isn't consistent and it was expressed that she was texting me from work. On top of that, she never asked anything from me and we started hitting it off, she is very kind, sweet, very expressive of feelings for me, heck its almost a little too easy. 

I asked the question again on day 3, ""If you are going to scam me please just stop now there is no buttering me up to get anything out of me?
Response: ""i will not steal your money, or break your heart, i will share photos of everything i do.""
Uhh wow well this isn't helping, maybe she is a very sincere beautiful young women, and my insecurities are blowing it?

I expressed that I would like to video chat again maybe longer this time. Unfortunately that hasn't happened yet due to work conflicts, but she told me she has the weekend off, and we can chat then. I will be providing updates on this for educational purposes.

What do you all think? I'm completely 50/50 on this whole girl. It feels quite possible I'm being ai scammed even on video chat, but 3 days in I'm still waiting for the scam opportunity that hasn't happened yet, and if it is it would suck that im talking to a fake for a whole month. If this is ai this is very scary folks, because I'm in cyber security and very good at sniffing out.

I'll leave updates here so some poor guy has the same thing going through there mind. I'll never plan on giving anything though, Wish me luck.

Early update: Thanks to comment inspiration I found the question that just confirmed it for me. She claims she runs operations at ww skincare. Which I just did my research and it's in new york city, which is nowhere near me.

Every week you won't have to spend hours commuting, cram yourself into a packed office, or run through traffic. Since they could get up, make coffee, and begin their day wherever they wanted, people who worked from home felt emancipated. Over time, however, it has become clear that not everyone works from home in the same manner.  
  
It has been very beneficial to many people. Small businesses may hire workers from anywhere, students can find jobs across the nation without relocating, and parents can spend more time with their children. The technology that keeps teams connected includes platforms like Zoom and Google Meet. For a time, it appeared like anyone could adopt this new way of functioning.  
  
However, the chances are not equal for everyone. Not everyone has access to good equipment, fast internet, or peaceful workspaces. Millions of Americans, especially those living in rural areas, still struggle to obtain reliable internet access, according to Pew Research. Working from home can often feel more stressful than liberating for many individuals.  
  
IIt might feel isolating to work from home, even if you have all the necessary resources. The screen cannot replace the experience of being with coworkers, engaging in casual conversations, or brainstorming together in person. Being at home without the presence of coworkers can lead to feelings of detachment or burnout.  
  
Perhaps the real question is not whether working remotely is good or bad, but how we can enhance its benefits for everyone. Businesses can provide hybrid services that allow employees to collaborate in person while maintaining some degree of autonomy. Kids can learn how to converse online with the help of their schools. People can also learn to establish healthier boundaries, including turning off devices at the end of the day, taking breaks, and scheduling face-to-face interactions.  
  
Regardless of where people log in from, we must ensure that everyone can work remotely, that it is balanced, and that it is healthy for them in order to make it truly equitable.

So this whole mess started six months ago. I work in marketing and my boss was always really charming, funny, made me feel special. We started staying late together, grabbing drinks after work, texting constantly. I told myself it was just friendship but deep down I knew what I was doing. I knew.

My husband works construction, comes home exhausted every day, and honestly we'd gotten into a rut. Same dinner conversations, same routines. When my boss started giving me attention it felt exciting again. Like I mattered.

One night I told my husband I had to work late on a big presentation. He just nodded, didn't question it. I met my boss at a bar instead. We were drinking, laughing, and I forgot I'd left my location sharing on. My husband called around 9pm.

I stepped outside to answer. He said, ""Hey, just checking in. You still at the office?""

I said yes. He went quiet for a second.

Then he said, ""Funny, because your location shows you at a bar downtown. And I can hear you laughing in the background on your Instagram story.""

My stomach dropped. I stammered something about the team going out after finishing the project. He didn't raise his voice. He just said, ""Keep her. She's your problem now,"" and hung up.

I called back immediately. He didn't answer. I drove home in a panic and when I got there at 11pm, half his stuff was already packed. He was throwing clothes into garbage bags.

I started crying, begging him to let me explain. He looked at me like I was a stranger. He said, ""There's nothing to explain. You lied to my face and I heard you having the time of your life with him. That's all I need to know.""

I grabbed his arm and he pulled away. He said, ""Don't touch me. I'm done.""

He slept at his brother's that night. I kept texting, calling, apologizing. He responded once: ""My lawyer will contact you.""

I legitimately thought he was being dramatic. That he'd cool off in a few days and we'd talk it through. We'd been together for eight years, married for five. People don't just throw that away.

But he filed for divorce that week. And then his family got involved.

His mother called me and tore me apart. She said I was trash, that her son deserved better, that she always knew I wasn't good enough for him. His sister posted on social media, didn't name me directly but everyone knew. She wrote about women who betray good men and how they always play victim when consequences come.

Then his brother sent screenshots of my texts with my boss to my entire family group chat. I don't know how he got them, maybe my husband had logged into my laptop before. But suddenly my parents, my siblings, my aunts and uncles, everyone saw the flirty messages, the plans to meet up, everything.

My dad called me and said he was ashamed. My mom cried on the phone asking where they went wrong raising me. My brother told me not to contact him until I sorted my life out.

My boss backed off immediately when things got messy. Turns out he has a wife and kids. He told me we needed to keep things professional and stopped responding to my messages.

The divorce was final last month. My husband got the house because I couldn't afford the mortgage alone and he had proof of my affair which made me look terrible in court. I'm renting a studio apartment now. My friends stopped inviting me places because most of them were our mutual friends and they sided with him.

I saw him last week at a coffee shop with someone new. She was laughing at something he said. He looked happy. He saw me, gave a polite nod, and turned back to her like I didn't exist.

I've been sitting here replaying everything in my head. I genuinely believed he'd forgive me eventually, that his family would calm down, that we'd find our way back. But I torched everything and there's no coming back from it.

Am I wrong for thinking his family took it too far by exposing me to everyone I know?

Hey everyone,

I run a tech startup based in Bangalore, and about a year ago, we took the plunge and hired a [PR Agency in India](https://tandemcommunication.net/). Before that, I was super skeptical. I thought PR was just a fancy term for sending out press releases and hoping for the best.

I was wrong.

After going through the process, I realized how strategic it can be. I see a lot of questions here about whether PR is worth it, especially for bootstrapped or early-stage companies. I wanted to break down what a good **PR Company in India** actually does, beyond the buzzwords, based on my experience.

This isn't an ad for our agency (I won't even name them unless a mod says it's okay). This is just a straight-talking guide from one founder to another.

**The Real Value: It's Not About ""Getting in the News""**

The biggest shift for me was understanding that PR isn't about getting a one-off article. It's about **building a reputation over time**.

* **For Startups (The ""Who TF are you?"" Phase):** The goal is **third-party validation**. A positive review or feature in a publication your customers trust is worth 100x more than your own ads. Our agency focused on getting us in front of specific tech bloggers and niche online magazines our target audience actually read. This wasn't about hitting the front page of a newspaper on day one.
* **For Scaling (The ""Why should I trust you?"" Phase):** This is where **thought leadership** comes in. Our agency ghostwrote solid, insightful articles for our CEO on platforms like YourStory and Inc42. It wasn't salesy; it was about sharing expertise. This built immense credibility when we were talking to enterprise clients.
* **For Crisis (The ""Oh Sh\*t"" Phase):** We haven't had a major one, but seeing the crisis plan they built for us was a game-changer. Knowing there's a protocol for when things go wrong is a huge weight off your shoulders.

**The ""Secret Sauce"" of a PR Agency in South Mumbai**

A lot of you will ask, ""Does location matter?"" In India, it kinda does. Our agency is based in South Mumbai, and the access is real.

* **They can get coffee with a journalist.** This isn't a metaphor. A [PR Agency in South Mumbai](https://tandemcommunication.net/contact) can literally walk over to the offices of major business dailies or news channels for an informal meeting. That face-to-face relationship builds trust and gets your story a fair hearing when it lands in an inbox flooded with a thousand other pitches.
* **They hear industry gossip.** Not the malicious kind, but the ""which publication is launching a new tech vertical"" or ""which journalist is moving to a new beat"" kind of intel. This helps them pitch smarter.

**What to Actually Expect (Spoiler: It's not magic)**

* **Timeline:** We saw our first small feature in about 6 weeks. Meaningful, consistent coverage took about 4-5 months. Anyone promising you front-page coverage in week 2 is lying.
* **Cost:** It's not cheap, but you can find **PR services in India** at different tiers. We went with a mid-sized firm. The ROI for us was in the qualified leads that came from the articles, which we tracked using specific UTM parameters.
* **Metrics That Matter:** Don't let them just send you a PDF of clippings. Ask for:
   * **Share of Voice:** How much are they talking about you vs. your competitors?
   * **Sentiment:** Is the coverage positive or neutral?
   * **Message Pull-Through:** Did the article actually mention our key differentiator, or just our company name?

**Final Takeaway:**

If you think a **PR Agency in India** is a magic wand for sales, you'll be disappointed. But if you see it as a long-term investment in building a brand that people know, like, and trust, it's 100% worth considering.

As someone feeling the pinch from out of control tipping culture (Gen Z), I have stopped tipping at places where food is not served to table (Where I pay and grab food at counter).

As a coffee lover, who likes exploring local cafes instead of corporate stores and usually tips ~15-18% at these cafes - was wondering what the consensus is around whether to tip or not. Because I’m ordering at and usually collecting at counter, and the cost is also higher. Would it be fair if I didn’t leave a tip at these places?

Open to different perspectives - trying to gauge what’s acceptable and whether ppl tip at local cafes.",4,1761891635.0,Calgary,5,0.7,False
