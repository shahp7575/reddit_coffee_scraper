1j54qh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j54qh4/aitah_for_ending_a_decade_long_friendship_because/,AITAH for ending a decade long friendship because she cheated. Causing the rest of the group to leave her as well?,"Summary:
OP (24M) and his tight-knit friend group of 7 (8 including Linda) discovered Linda (26M) had been cheating on Mark (25M), her boyfriend of nearly two years. OP and Mark caught her outside a hotel with another guy while she was supposedly ""out of town."" Mark confronted her the next day and learned she had been cheating for six months, with two other guys before this one. Disgusted, OP cut her off, and the rest of the group gradually followed—except OP’s girlfriend, Amber (23F), who believed it wasn’t their place to exile Linda.

Recently, Amber confronted OP, saying he ""ruined Linda’s life"" by turning their friends against her. This led to a heated argument at OP’s place, but OP stood firm, explaining that cheating is a dealbreaker for him. The next day, after taking Amber to her favorite café, he calmly laid out his reasoning. Amber eventually agreed to keep her distance for Mark’s sake, but OP still wonders if he handled things the right way.

Full Story:
I've had a close-knit group of friends for over a decade. Two years ago, one of them—Linda—started dating Mark, a great guy we all quickly bonded with. Seven months in, Linda told him she loved him.

Fast forward to January. Mark and I were driving past a hotel when I saw Linda outside. Before I could call out, a guy walked up, kissed her on the cheek, and they went inside. Mark looked shattered—she had told him she was ""out of town"" for three more days. We waited outside for over two hours in silence, smoking through a pack of cigarettes. When she finally came out, she kissed the guy goodbye, then spotted us and froze. She tried to act casual, and asked ""What are you guys doing here!"" And I said ""I'll wait in the car Mark"".
Mark stopped me and said,
""Let's get that drink"". I looked at him saw his eyes teary and said
""Don't you wanna talk!"" And he said
""About what?""

Later that night at a pub, Mark barely spoke, just downing beer. When I asked what he was going to do, he asked what I would do. I told him, ""Talk to her. Just not tonight."" He decided to confront her the next morning. I took him to my place to crash, and when I woke up, he was already gone.

That evening, I checked in on him—he looked like a mess. He told me Linda had been cheating for six months, with two other guys before this one. That was it for me. I told our friends what happened and made it clear—I was done with Linda. Over time, everyone else quietly distanced themselves too.

Except for my girlfriend, Amber. She didn’t approve of what Linda did but thought we had no right to exile her. We didn’t talk much about it until recently, when she came over for a quiet night in. After dinner, while I was setting up Netflix, she casually said, ""I met Linda earlier today.""

I shut it down immediately. ""I don't want to talk about this, Amber.""

""You ruined her life. How can we not talk about it?""

That set me off. ""I ruined her life? She cheated, she lied, she betrayed all of us. This is on her.""

Amber kept pushing, saying Linda lost all her friends in an instant because I turned everyone against her. I snapped, ""Unless she slipped and fell on their dicks, I don’t care."" After some back and forth, we went to bed without resolving it.

The next morning, I made her breakfast, but she just had coffee and left. That evening, I picked her up from work and took her to her favorite café. I calmly explained why cheating is a dealbreaker for me.

""If Linda cheated, lied to, and betrayed the man she claimed to have loved more than anything, what makes you so sure you and I could or anyone could trust her? I know I can't because I don't want to doubt every word that comes out of her mouth. On top of all that, Mark is our friend and she hurt him. Which one would you exclud from our trips or when we're hanging out? The guy who's always been loyal to us and her, who even after finding out he's been cheated on didn't raise is voice the slightest or the girl who cheated on him and lied to us for years?""

Amber finally said, ""I love Mark, but I love Linda too. Maybe I can’t forgive her, but I’ll keep my distance for now—for Mark.""

Things seems to fine for now but I help but feel, maybe Amber was right. Maybe I could have handled things differently. I don't know how but still..

A friend and I shoved off into the wilds of West Virginia last September on the Canaan Valley and the Forks of Cheat route for a truly wonderful weekend of bikepacking. I wanted to get a trip report in for anyone nearby who is considering a trip this year. I can't imagine a more fun and beautiful weekend one could have than the time we spent in West Virginia. If you're anywhere within four or five hours of Davis, I highly recommend this route, it's an absolute dream.

**Day 1 - Davis through Blackwater Falls \~6 miles**  
We got into Davis at about 5 and went to [Hellbender Burritos](https://www.hellbenderburritos.com/) to have a dinner in camp. It was also the perfect time to drop by [Stumptown Ales](https://www.stumptownales.com/) before we got on route. One of the first people we met is the town's just retired physician who is now a long distance bikepacker himself. We swapped some stories and had a few drinks before leaving our car at Blackwater Bikes and heading through Blackwater Falls State Park, catching the sunset along the way.

We were a little stressed about how our camping would turn out since we were just going ""somewhere along Canaan Loop road"", but it couldn't have gone better. We took the first campsite on our right after getting onto gravel and out of the state park. The first mile or so of road to the campsite were rough and we despaired a little bit for our long day tomorrow, but it got smoother. But first, the campsite was incredible! The first vista in the photos is from that campsite, thousands of feet above the Black Fork and overlooking the rail trail we'd be on in a couple of days.

**Day 2 - Blackwater Falls to Bickle Knob \~53 miles**

After a cozy night and amazing breakfast views, we set off onto Canaan Loop road. The first 4-5 miles were nasty. Hike a bike for our gravel bikes, wet, muddy, rocky, and rough. It took us about an hour to get it done and we were really worried about having 15 miles of this, but it only got smoother as we went on. Pretty soon, it was nice gravel roads and we rolled through the next bit smoothly.

There followed some very nice backroads before a scary 2.5 miles on a busy, 55mph road. It went well for us but it still made us nervous. Then it was back onto beautiful backroads for the rest of the trip.

The grass trails around Canaan Valley State Park were surprising and luxurious and we basked in them for a few miles. Then it was rolling pavement and gravel mixed for the rest of the day. Quite a bit of climbing but no real nasty climbs save one mile long kicker at 17%, that one hurt.

Going in September meant that apples were ripe and falling off the trees and I ate about a half dozen of them throughout the trip. There's nothing cooler than pulling an apple off a wild tree and snacking on it along your ride. 10/10 would recommend.

The final climb of day 1 was a grind after so much up and down, but we got through it with a little extra sugar. We had originally counted on the [Lodge at Alpena](https://www.lodgeinalpena.com/) for a snack since we had read they had a market there, but no dice, so we pushed on with what we had. They did offer us sodas and a chance to wash up in their restroom which we happily took.

We skipped [Bear Haven campground ](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mnf/recarea/?recid=6981)(which looked nice) for a chance to camp near the fire tower at [Bickle Knob](https://elkinsrandolphwv.com/place/bickle-knob-observation-tower/). We were lucky to find it empty, since there is only really one spot to put tents there, but boy was it worth the risk. After dinner on top of a fire tower with panoramic views of amazing mountains, we settled in for the night.

**Day 3 - Bickle Knob to Davis \~42 miles**

Day 3 started with breakfast on the fire tower and the sunrise before a long, steep descent back down toward the river. The first 35 miles were pretty much all downhill, which was a relief after all the climbing the day before. We settled in for some very nice riding along the Shavers Fork. Lunch was spent in the water there, as we slipped down and set up our chairs on the rocks. We cooled our beers in a deep pool, cooled our bodies in the water. I highly recommend swimming somewhere in the Shavers if you get the chance.

Civilization beckoned in the form of Parsons, WV a cute little town at the confluence of Shavers and Black Forks. A second, late lunch was enjoyed riverside at [Black Fork Pizza and Riverside Brews](https://blackforkpizza.com/). We sat on the patio and enjoyed beer and nachos as we watched the river go by, knowing we were closing in on the end of our adventure. Just 17 miles to go. And boy did we underestimate them.

A bike trail picked up out of Parsons, turning into an historic rail trail that's the bed of a now defunct wonder of engineering as they laid one of the steepest railroads at the time. It's only 4%, how bad can it be? Bad. This section was interminable, 10 miles at 4% incline with no letoff the entire time. The trail was excellent, the river views were pretty, there was no traffic at all to deal with, but boy were the legs feeling it. Fortunately, the end of the rail trail coincided with two excellent swimming areas and we dove in again to was off the grime and refresh ourselves.

The end of the trail was the beautiful little town of Thomas, WV where we wish we'd had time to spend a night. Coffee, ice cream, bookstores, art shops, breweries, bluegrass, and more met us in this excellent burg. We indulged ourselves a little bit, then hit the final climb up out of Thomas before diving back down the busy road to Davis and our car. We celebrated the weekend with one more beer at Stumptown and basked in the memories of a truly excellent trip.

**Final Thoughts**

If you're considering this route in West Virginia, go for it! It made for a truly wonderful weekend in the wilds. That first campsite after getting on Canaan Loop road is astonishing and there are others along the way in case it's full already. Bear Haven is an excellent campsite if you don't want to risk Bickle being full already and it saves you a little bit of climbing on that day too. Swim in the rivers, get nachos in Parsons and ice cream and/or beer in Thomas and Davis.

Don't underestimate that final rail trail, it's a grind. But it's the last hurdle and at the end of a smooth, easy day, so you can do it.

I'd do this route again in a heartbeat. Thanks [Bikepacking.com](http://Bikepacking.com) for an excellent route guide.

1j54n6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1j54n6b/i_introduced_to_you_my_latest_pcosfriendly/,I introduced to you my latest PCOS-Friendly obsession: Allulose,"I know I can’t be the only cyster who has struggled with cutting out sweets. Everyone says “just use monkfruit!” or “try stevia!”, but those genuinely taste repulsive to me. I loathe the sweetener aftertaste. I have always sworn that nothing could take the place of my beloved cane sugar. 

That is until I tried allulose. What drew me in is that it is actually a (rare) naturally occurring sugar that could potentially stimulate the production of GLP-1. Yes, *that* GLP-1. If you’re not on Ozempic or Wegovy and have insulin resistance like me, the thought is appealing. It’s also zero calorie.

So I figured I could give it a try. I mean I’ve tried every other sugar substitute there is and hated them, but maybe just maybe this one would be good. 

And let me tell you, apart from being just a bit less sweet than regular cane sugar, it has NO noticeable taste difference to me. If you’re familiar with the taste of powdered inositol and how mild it is, allulose is even more mild than that! Yes, I did try dry scooping it lol. 

Anyway I can’t speak to the GLP-1 response personally as I’ve only been using it in my coffee for a week, but I wanted to share in case anyone here might find this useful. It’s a game changer for me. Even if it didn’t actually turn out to have any impact on my insulin resistance or appetite at all, it has dramatically brought down the caloric content of my daily iced coffee and tastes great, so it’s a huge win. 

Fair warning: consuming allulose can cause digestive upset. The body does not metabolize it. I saw one person on tiktok recommend to slowly increase your consumption so that you know what you can handle and so far I’m at 2 teaspoons in my coffee with no side effects. YMMV.

Are you that Sales Manager that just struggles with fast English conversations? 

If your answer is yes, then I will let you in on a secret. 

It’s not just about learning words—it’s about HOW you say them!



Here are 3 powerful secrets to improve your communication skills:



 ✅1. Master Word Stress

 Did you know ""CONtract"" (a noun) and ""conTRACT"" (a verb) are pronounced differently? Native speakers rely on stressed syllables to understand meaning instantly. Practicing this will make your speech clearer and more natural.



 ✅2. LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN!



The more you listen, the more you understand. At first, fast English might feel overwhelming—like when you hear, ""Gonna grab a coffee, wanna come?"" instead of ""I am going to get a coffee. Do you want to come?""

It might seem too fast, but don’t worry! Just keep listening. Over time, your brain will get used to these words/phrases, and soon, you’ll understand without even thinking about it. 😊🎧



✅3. Expand Your Vocabulary – 5 Words a Day

 Small, consistent learning wins. 5 words a day = 1,825 words a year. Imagine how much stronger your business communication will be!



For example, today you could learn:

 ✅ Negotiate – to discuss something to reach an agreement

 ✅ Revenue – the money a company earns

 ✅ Pitch – a persuasive business presentation

 ✅ Leverage – to use something to your advantage

 ✅ Follow-up – to check in after a conversation or meeting

Keep a notebook, write them down, and use them in real conversations! The key is learning AND using new words.



What’s one new word you’ve learned recently? Share in the comments! 👇😊

- Creating a brighter, more radiant smile

The Impact of Coffee on Teeth Whitening

Coffee and Tooth Staining

**Coffee is notorious for causing tooth discoloration**. The dark pigments in coffee contain tannins that easily attach to tooth enamel, creating stubborn stains. When you're undergoing a teeth whitening treatment, these stains become even more problematic.

Immediate Effects of Coffee During Whitening

During teeth whitening, your tooth enamel becomes more porous and susceptible to staining. This means:

- Increased likelihood of permanent staining
- Reduced effectiveness of whitening treatment
- Potential reversal of whitening results

Recommendations for Coffee Drinkers

Temporary Abstinence Strategy

Most dental professionals recommend:

- Avoiding coffee completely during whitening treatment
- Waiting at least 48 hours after treatment before consuming coffee
- Using a straw to minimize direct contact with teeth

Alternative Beverage Options

While whitening, consider:

1. Herbal tea
2. Water
3. Clear or light-colored beverages
4. Milk-based drinks

And I was actually too tight and I guess he took it as I wasn't into him. I noticed he became quite frustrated. After some time I decided to go home.
On the next day I texted him,saying I enjoyed the night and that he could come over to my place next time. He said he also enjoyed and agreed. So during the week he would only reply to my texts once per day saying he was busy. 
I invited him to come over to my place on Saturday, but he replied in german (he knows I'm not fluent) that he was busy this week and we could do the next. I took it as a lack of interest and a bit rude. But I still replied I was busy the next week and maybe we could meet do during the week. He then replied he couldn't do during the week so maybe the week after.

The apartment manager provided me with a notice of a lease violation - referred to as a first warning - regarding the cleanliness of the apartment and provided another date for re-inspection in less than one week.

The notice only referred to a general provision in the lease stating I had to follow all rules but nothing specific. The cure provision was to clean the entirety of the apartment. I reached out to inquire about the specific rule I was considered in violation of as well as what specifically needed to be cleaned. I also noticed that I was missing a few personal items and brought that up with the apartment manager. I did not know that the apartment manager was the one to have inspected the apartment. Since then, the apartment manager reached out with additional claims.

1. No dogs, cats, or other animals of any kind are allowed in the Apartment, unless approved and registered with Landlord. Small caged and/or aquarium housed pets, not to exceed three pounds (3 lbs.) in weight, are permitted.  

I have an aquarium, and have had one since moving in. In prior inspections there have been no comments regarding them. The apartment manager now insists that I needed to have registered the fish. I believe it's allowed under the lease itself.

2. Permit any accumulation of refuse in the Apartment or anywhere in the Community

So far the only justification I have heard is that I had a takeout box from that days lunch on my coffee table and had a tied garbage bag by the door (inside my apartment).

3. Resident shall take good care of the Apartment and shall maintain Apartment in same condition as upon move in.

While it's not the same condition it was upon move in, I believe that's a result of normal use. The apartment was empty when I moved in. While it's not spotless, it certainly isn't completely filthy.

4. The comfort and rights of other residents must not be interfered with.  Resident agrees not to make loud noises, annoying sounds, disturbances, odors, nuisance or do anything else which interferes with or disturbs the rights, comfort or convenience of other residents or which interferes with or disturbs the Community staff.  Landlord is entitled to determine in its sole judgment whether you have violated this section.

The landlord now cites a text I was sent a couple months prior due to ""stomping."" This is the only notice I've received within the nearly 2 years I lived at this apartment.

What are my rights in this situation, I'm concerned that the apartment manager is trying to set me up for eviction. I'd like to avoid that, if at all possible, but moving may be difficult. ",1,1741290888.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

Hi.

So. I grew up in this house hold and left briefly for 10 years and lived with an abusive, narcissist man in the UK. I jumped out of the fire, into the frying pan, and back into the fire to put it shortly. 

Growing up, my mother always pitted me against my sister and would gossip about me with her. I heard everything through our walls. When I would bring it up and complain about how unfair it was, both would deny deny deny. They'd call me crazy, depressive, manic. My father didn't help, he was too busy living his own life and enabled my mother to do whatever she wanted. If he ever parented me, it would be in a militaristic (he was in the Navy) tone. My sister? She was her own unique cupcake, honestly. She was sleeping around with boys from 14, got caught smoking after school, went through rehab, got pregnant at 17. 

 The only time I ever actively rebelled against their wishes was once in Highschool. My grades were faltering due to having moved a lot, I kinda checked out mentally, I didn't see the point and instead focused on theatre and that was my outlet to feel anything.  My folks refused to sign my permission slip to partake in a county competition with a class written script for stage production, proclaiming my grades as the reason why. It did not further motivate me, instead I pretended to take the lose. I let them forget which day the competition was taking place, saved up pocket change from lunches, told them I was sick and let them go about their lives. I snuck onto a county bus and traveled to the competition and was home before they knew it.  I wasn't perfect, I had a lot of pent up rage about my situation and once flipped a coffee table. I remember being held down a lot by my folks, and once my mother ripped my door off it's hinges when I was 11, which they still laugh about to this day. They think traumatizing their children is healthy parenting.



When I was 18, my folks threatened to send me to a state boot camp and offered me a position at Career Start Walt Disney or the boot camp. I was not a troubled child, I stayed on my computer and wrote my novels and stories. I just lacked motivation and had no interest in a social life. I mean who could blame me, with the three humans I was interacting with everyday... I wasn't impressed with anyone. I had one boyfriend who I was involved with, his name was Gregory and my folks insisted taht I come home at 11 pm, it was their household, their rules they said. I accidentally fell asleep while out at his place and received an irate phonecall that morning at 5:30 am.



 Safe to say...I never reached out to anyone after that, but one day while I was playing a free to play mmo on my laptop, I met a man from the UK.  He was 23 and I was very freshly 18. He charmed me to the point that he came out to visit me, and we had a mini vacation. I want to tell you it was magical and marvelous, but he was a fish out of water in America and well.. I was just a fish out of water.

  
I landed that position with Disney Career Start (like I had a choice) and moved to Orlando in August of my 18th year. I think this was 2007? The year and dates are actually fuzzy, so are some of my years of marriage.  I found I was enjoying myself at Disney and wanted to start actually living a life there. When I told my UK boyfriend this, he immediately started breaking down at me ""What about us, our future we were planning together?"" I felt so much pressure and I told him maybe we should break up. Oh man, that was the wrong way to go about it. He spam called me for two hours straight before one of my room mates begged me to pick up the phone. I don't know why I answered it and accepted his pleading lies, but I figured maybe he wouldn't be the one to let me down? 

10 years later while I was pregnant, he cheated on me after I had moved out there to be with him. I called my mother after 8 years of being no contact with my tail tucked between my legs. I was barely surviving the pregnancy, not to mention his constant berating me of our life together. 

But, this post isn't about him. It's about the actions that have transpired since coming back here to live with my folks. My mother helped me save my son when he was 7 days old (prolonged qt event), but they refused to allow me a peaceful work life, would often have me call out of my catering chef position, when covid haopened I had my own apartment for a little while, but they were convincing and tme  the world was falling apart and that we needed to circle our wagons. 

So they bought us RV campers and moved out to the middle of nowhere Florida. In 2020 I went up to PA to help a friend and my mom said she'd watch my son, and they threatened to keep him and not return him, which cut my trip short as I came back directly and took my son to stay with a friend (who turned out to be a physically abusive woman, so again I ended up BACK home after ""making amends""- aka lording it over my head that I was incapable of making proper decisions on my own). The RV's pipes burst due to being over a sulfur well deposit, we were pooping in buckets, this wasn't the life for my son. Only after I kicked fuss about it, did we move into a house. I met a man, he got me pregnant and skipped town.  Great, 2 kids and controlling parents.

They used my food stamps to pay for their keto food, they buy my children's love with a lot of gifts. And my mother talks about me to my sister over facebook messenger, oh and my sister's husband? toxic. He stalks my social media and feeds my sister and mother all the gossip. Like there really is any. I'm a spiritual person, I'm anti-capitalistic, I'm not a Trump fan like they are... and apparently that is something to hate? 

So now I'm a single mom, they forced me to quit my job and watch both kids full time. If I ask for one single night out, I'm met with consternation and annoyance. They use my money, they use my food stamps, they drain me emotionally and mentally. We have a family vacation coming up at the end of this month. I have 2k and a friend in Georgia that might be able to help me and the kids. I'm really considering using that as an excuse to pack and leave with my babies in the middle of the night while I'm closer to Georgia.

1j542re,https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/1j542re/community_compost_bin_wants/,Community compost bin wants?,"Hey compost nerds! The volunteer leader of my community compost bins is moving and asked me to take over. We are a small three-bin system operating in a community garden under supervision from the parks department. Aside from the occasional workday and reminder to maintain a mix of greens and browns, the bins have been laissez-faire for the past several years. I'm happy to maintain that if that's what folks want, but I also have some ideas. I'll post a list of them below, but I'm also interested in hearing from others. 

**Do you have any ideas for programs, events, opportunities, or services that would benefit community composting? Also, please brag about what makes your community compost program special!**

Here's what I have been thinking about: 

* Make composting a bit easier by upgrading dilapidated fixtures, getting an aerator, and adding a table and some tools to help scoop out and clean up personal compost bins
* Maintaining a calendar, list, or newsletter of other environmental opportunities (plant swaps, volunteer opportunities, land grant university/cooperative extension programs, etc)
* Seasonal events, like fall apple pressing and fruit scrap vinegar making, a post-Halloween pumpkin smash

Once upon a time, ATMs only spit out crumpled banknotes, and crypto was just an online curiosity for tech geeks. Fast forward to today, and boom—Bitcoin ATMs are popping up like mushrooms after a rainy day! But what’s even cooler? You don’t need a physical Bitcoin ATM to generate your own Bitcoin QR codes, thanks to [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Let’s dive into the wonderful world of Bitcoin ATMs and how your phone can be a crypto powerhouse.

# What Are Bitcoin ATMs, and Why Are They So Awesome?

A Bitcoin ATM (BATM) is just like your traditional bank ATM—but instead of withdrawing dirty fiat bills, you’re dealing with pure, decentralized digital gold: Bitcoin! These machines allow users to buy (and sometimes sell) Bitcoin using cash or a debit card. Some even support other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin or Ethereum, but let’s be real—Bitcoin is king.

Bitcoin ATMs are found in gas stations, malls, coffee shops, and sometimes in the most random locations. They’re popular because they make buying Bitcoin as easy as getting a snack from a vending machine. No complex exchange sign-ups, no KYC headaches (on some machines), just scan, pay, and boom—Bitcoin in your wallet.

# How Do Bitcoin ATMs Work?

Using a Bitcoin ATM is as easy as ordering fast food. Here’s how the process typically goes:

1. **Find a Bitcoin ATM** – You can use online maps to locate the nearest Bitcoin ATM.
2. **Choose Your Transaction** – Decide whether you’re buying or selling Bitcoin.
3. **Scan Your Wallet** – The ATM will display a QR code scanner. Just open your Bitcoin wallet and scan it.
4. **Insert Cash or Card** – Depending on the machine, you can insert physical cash or pay with a debit card.
5. **Confirm and Receive Bitcoin** – The ATM sends Bitcoin to your wallet, usually within minutes.

Selling Bitcoin? Some ATMs let you send BTC to the machine, and after confirmation, they spit out cash like a classic ATM.

# Why Bitcoin ATMs Are Taking Over

Bitcoin ATMs have exploded in popularity. Why? Because they remove the friction of traditional exchanges. Here’s why people love them:

* **No Bank Involvement** – You don’t need a bank account to use a Bitcoin ATM. Perfect for people who want financial privacy.
* **Instant Transactions** – Unlike online exchanges that can take hours or days, Bitcoin ATMs process transactions in minutes.
* **User-Friendly** – Even grandma can use one. No confusing crypto exchanges or complex trading pairs.
* **Increased Accessibility** – More and more cities worldwide are getting Bitcoin ATMs, making crypto adoption easier.

But wait—what if you don’t have a Bitcoin ATM nearby? That’s where QR codes come into play.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker: Your Digital ATM

Not everyone has a Bitcoin ATM within walking distance, but that doesn’t mean you can’t receive Bitcoin like a pro. This is where [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) shines. Instead of relying on an ATM to generate QR codes for transactions, you can create your own with ease.

# Why Do You Need a Bitcoin QR Code?

Let’s face it—typing out a long Bitcoin wallet address is a recipe for disaster. One wrong character, and your funds vanish into the crypto abyss, never to be seen again. A Bitcoin QR code simplifies this process by converting your wallet address into a scannable image. Here’s why that’s awesome:

* **No Typos, No Losses** – A QR code eliminates the risk of mistyping a wallet address.
* **Instant Transactions** – Scan and send. No need to copy and paste long addresses.
* **Perfect for Businesses** – If you accept Bitcoin, displaying a QR code at your shop or website makes payments seamless.
* **Easy Sharing** – Send your Bitcoin address to friends or customers with a simple scan.

# How to Use the Bitcoin QR Code Maker

Using the [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) is as easy as brewing a cup of coffee. Here’s what you do:

1. **Go to the website** – Open your browser and visit the Bitcoin QR Code Maker.
2. **Enter Your Wallet Address** – Type or paste your Bitcoin address into the input field.
3. **Set an Amount (Optional)** – If you’re requesting a specific payment, you can set a fixed amount.
4. **Generate Your QR Code** – Click the button, and boom! Your QR code is ready.
5. **Download or Share** – Save the QR code as an image or share it with others.

Now, whenever someone wants to send you Bitcoin, they just scan the code—no manual typing required.

# The Future: More Bitcoin ATMs and Smarter QR Code Payments

As crypto adoption keeps growing, Bitcoin ATMs will become as common as coffee machines. More businesses will accept Bitcoin, and QR codes will become the standard for payments. With tools like Bitcoin QR Code Maker, you don’t even need a physical ATM to make fast, secure transactions.

So whether you’re buying Bitcoin at an ATM or generating a QR code from your phone, the future of cash is here—and it’s digital. Get your Bitcoin, scan your QR codes, and stay ahead of the curve!

1j53znf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1j53znf/just_when_you_think_youve_figured_it_out/,Just when you think you've figured it out,"I decided to finally get some answers, I’m going to say fuck all to everything else and finally find Lia, or at least what happened to her. Those here on this site are right- I can't even begin to think ahead until I find Lia, for better or worse.

First I called upon Eka Kwinal to ask for another feather. He wasn’t too pleased despite the fact that I called upon some rats and pigeons (and any other dietary needs for a hawk) out into his area so that he may feed more. After some bartering for more prey I took one of his breast feathers as it was smaller and would fit in the bag I was making for Vritra. He seemed agreeable and curious now to my presence and intentions, maybe I made a friend. Were I to remain here I could definitely use the companionship, the loneliness is getting a bit much I have to admit.

 I went to The Cage to discuss things with Richter and the rest of his coterie to see if I could get them to meet with Mia and hopefully come to some sort of agreement about the situation concerning our sect.

 *""...distance yourself from your sectarian distractions.""*

The words this Vritra wrote in her missive were suddenly at the forefront of my thinking. I needed to focus on the task at hand though –get the fucking Anarchs to talk to each other and then I can grab Lizzie and hopefully get some answers out of her before I went to Vritra. Back in the day Lia and I unofficially adopted her and were going to take her with us when we inevitably left for our compound upstate. *Jeez was it even still there?*

Look I know escaping and trying to live happily ever after was a pipe-dream and probably wouldn't have worked. Stupid , I know

Lizzie may be one of my best bets for finding out where Lia is, but thinking about it: if Lizzie wasn’t with Lia or vice-versa then what does that tell me? My clothes felt unnatural and bothersome I started to growl and tear my clothes away but stopped myself. Just thinking about it threatened to let the beast take control. Get it together just get it together I kept telling myself as I got to the club.

 I shook my head and walked up to the bouncer, ignoring all the glares and comments from the people in line. The six and a half feet of muscle and overpowering cologne looked me up and down shaking his head. He stepped forward ""Get in the line or get the fuck..."" he barked

 ""Tell Richter Shady's here to see him!"" I interrupted him barking louder than he was. I reached up to the hood I was wearing making sure one of my clawed fingers peeked out from the sleeves I was keeping them in and grinned settling my finger on my sunglasses about to pull them down. He quickly caught himself and muttered something like an apology and waved to the other bouncer who gave bouncer number one a cell phone.  People kept staring at me like I was a leper or something. Maybe I needed to put on some cleaner clothes. Just thinking about it made me aware of how my toenails were scratching through the mismatched boots I was wearing and how I wanted to tear all of it off and run on four legs to hunt.

 My escorts took me through the main entrance passing the dance floor, underneath the catwalks past the stage and the freight elevator that led to the upper floors. The massive iron cage (from which the club gets its’ name) swung over the gyrating crowd as the bass and drums of the music threatened to dislodge it and anything not bolted down. Instead of going to the office they took me down to a few rooms that I didn’t remember from thirty years ago so it must have been a newer addition. Inside were reinforced concrete wall surrounding a small circular pit for lack of a better word. There was a walkway that surrounded it where people (it seemed mostly kindred) were shouting at two licks brawling, fangs bared, flickers of celerity and a lot of blood on the floor. I saw Lizzie standing with Consuela just off the Richter’s side. She smiled at me which quickly vanished as she glanced at Richter who seemed enthralled by the mess below.

 After one of the licks went down he finally acknowledged me and asked what I wanted. I told him to talk to Mia and he quickly got an attitude. He said she just wanted a fight

“No, she really wants to meet, no fighting no violence so we can all get on the same page.” I crossed my arms.

“Sure I’ll believe it when I see it.” He growled

 “Cool so when?” I just stared at him.

“When what?”

“When do you want to see it and start believing?”

“When she comes here alone without her crew” *yeah right*

“Look I can fucking understand both sides, you don’t want to fuck with this plushy little kingdom you run, I get it, it’s your domain so you can do what the fuck you want , that is if you’d give your balls a tug and just admit you’re the Baron.”

“Why bother I already know who I am and so does every fucking lick in the South Bronx.” He grinned at me “Except for Mia.”

“And Mia is a trueblood believer and can’t stand the fucking Camarilla. She wants the ideals we were first created for-freedom. She just thinks we should be taking the city back and send those who think they rule over everything to go fuck themselves, they’ve pushed and now we need to push back.”

“What is she going to push?  All the suicidal idiots are with her, most don’t want anything to do with it.”

“That’s my point we don’t have the numbers to go on the offensive and nor do we have the numbers to defend ourselves if they decide to attack.”

“They’re not going to really attack, if they did it would have been worse than what Torque got, in case you don’t know Sleeping Beauty, the Camarilla has retreated in a lot of places we’re taking their territory andwe’re on top now.” He laughed

“First off if the Camarilla is retreating then there’s a good fucking reason for it. And all that shit about taking their territories? It’s a set up- an O.I.T.”

“What the fuck is an O.I.T?” he snarled

“Old Indian Trick, let the enemy think you’re gone and then launch a massive counter-offensive when they get comfortable. In this fucking case however they’re running from the Inquisition and when we go in and take over we become targets for these hunters, get wiped out, the hunters leave and the cam continues biz as usual, no more anarchs no more hunters-easy-fucking-peasy.”

He shook his head “You need to have some coffee and wake up more. The Sabbat’s all but gone and The Camarilla lost their eternal playmates they got no purpose now. Besides the Camarilla had their precious Elysium- attacked by hunters so fuck ‘em.”

 “You think the Sabbat is gone?? Didn’t you hear a fucking word I said? They’re probably setting us all up for something bigger and if we don’t pay attention they come back and wipe us out or make us into furniture or something. Like I said- Old Indian Trick.”

“Whatever happens –happens. We Anarchs are in a way better position now so whatever comes of this shit doesn’t matter. We don’t need to attack or raise an army” he shrugged

“Whatever comes of it realize we aren’t in such a great place. And those kindred you extort for rent? Don’t you think we’d have more of a numbers advantage if you just let them be> they are potential recruits and you treating them like shit is just going to cost us in the end all the Cam has to do is show up and offer a hand-out and now the cam has more numbers- the Gilded Cage is always more comfortable.”

“This.” He motioned around the room “… is the only cage we need. Go back to sleep Shades or get with the times.”

“Fuck you, call Mia and hash this shit out, I’m done for now I need to find Lia.” I growled

He looked at me confused. “You don’t know what happened to her?”

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up I felt a whine forming in my throat, tears threatened to erupt “No, do you?” I tried to sound tough.

He thought for a minute still confused. “No, no I actually don’t.” he shook his head. “Look shit was crazy back then, I don’t know what happened to a lot of licks. You might have to ask Lizzie but I don’t think she knows either.” He shook off whatever it was he was thinking and looked at me “All I know is that after shit went down Lizzie was a mess, talking about how you and Lia were gonna take her away and live some fucking cozy kindred Waltons bullshit or something, so if you fuck around with her head again there’s going to be trouble.” He glared at me.

“Fuck you call Mia.” I turned to go and talk to Lizzie, past all the disgusted looks and glares

“Maybe next time don’t dress like you got your clothes from a donation bin.” He called after me “I need some standards in my place.”

“But I DO get my clothes from the donation bin and this place ain’t so nice” I chirped.

 Lizzie grinned as I approached and skipped the last few steps to me. I grabbed her arm and pulled her close.

 “Listen to me” I growled “You’re going to fucking tell me what happened to Lia.” She looked surprised for a moment but the pulled me out of the room up towards where the ‘private booths’ were. After screaming randomly into a few that were occupied she found an empty one. She closed the curtain and grabbed my arm.

 “I don’t remember what happened to Lia I really don’t I really really don’t and I know you don’t believe me so I have to make you trust me.”

Before I could respond she grabbed my arm and bit down, the feel of fangs penetrating my flesh was instantly ecstatic. It took a few seconds to orient myself and I tried to dislodge her from my arm

“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? GET THE FUCK OFF ME.” I roared and stuck my foot against her to pry her off. “Get off me Lizzie I don’t do that shit…grrrrrr..” I growled loudly again and managed to pull her fangs out of my arm. She fell against the wall and slid down into a sitting position. “Holy forking shirtballs you got the good stuff.. I SAID GOD DAMN!!” she grinned as by blood soaked her chin. I licked my wound.

 “What the fuck is wrong with you Lizzie!!!” I snarled

“It’s the only way I can get you to trust me.” She looked up at me “I’m not your enemy and I want to find Lia too I just don’t remember so if this is what I have to do to get you to believe that I’m not going to hurt you no matter what anyone says then I’m gonna do it especially since..” she put her hand to the side of her face as if she were telling me a secret “…I used the Infection-winkies- on you because I was told I have to avoid you and make you go away from Mia and I was pissed because you didn’t remember your promise but then you didn’t kill me for it and I was sorry and I still want you to be my mom.” She rattled off.

 I was still reeling a bit, “You don’t have to fucking bind yourself to me I don’t want to control you Lizzie I’m not your…” I didn’t know what to say despite this weird emotional blackmail I was dealing with.

She slid up against the wall and stared at me “I want to.” She whispered and took both my hands in hers and looked at the floor. I was about to say something when she suddenly leapt forward and kissed me, before I could respond the cutain tore away as Airbox and Mario stood there looking pretty pissed. “What’s going…oh.” Mario looked astonished. “Do you mind?” Lizzie, still pressed up against me, said as she looked at Mario, grinned and said “Wink!” while winking at him.

 I know I looked utterly confused so I had no idea how Lizzie was going to sell this. Both of them nodded dumbly, Airbox even grinned. “Uh, sorry.” Mario mumbled as both of them got one last peak and closed the curtain. I was shaking my head and was about to say something when Lizzie pushed off me and wiped her mouth. “EEWWWW Mom! Like I’m your daughter and I’m not like stuck under a table or in a dryer -Keep it in your pants!” At this point I was still trying to process what just happened. She took my face in her hands and whispered “Meet me at my place in a few hours” kissed me on the forehead and left. I took a moment and pulled myself together and quickly made my way out not even paying attention to anything around me. I flew back to my hidey hole in Harlem to try and get my head around everything.

*Why doesn’t anyone remember what happened to Lia?*

Before I could start formulating questions I heard the flap of wings and the caw of a crow. I climbed out of my little tunnel and noticed there was mist surrounding me. The flap of wings drew my attention to the crow perched on the fence that separated the entrance to me tunnel of dirt from the rest of the grounds. A large black crow stood there with a small rolled up scroll in its claw. I tried to speak to it but all it said to me was ‘READ!’ dropped the scroll and took off. I unfurled it recognizing the script.

 *Concrete Flower, Below you will find instructions as to where to meet those who will conduct you to our engagement tomorrow evening. I request you be punctual and assure you, once again, that no harm shall come to you in any form. -Vritra*

 Great, I had to get my head together and sort this shit out. I went back to Lizzie’s loft later that night. When I came in she was sitting on the floor rocking back and forth crying. I asked her what was wrong. She frenzied then with an unearthly screech she started clawing at the air around her. I used animalism to calm her down again. She kept telling me she had to remember but couldn’t and curled up in my lap crying. All I could do was stroke her hair and sang the first song I could think of to continue to calm her “Needles and Pins” the Tom Petty/ Stevie Nicks version. We stayed like that for awhile both of us crying until it was time to go into the basement to sleep. I held her tight in my arms knowing I would have to leave tomorrow to deal with more of the unknown.",3,1741289816.0,SchreckNet,0,1.0,False

## Why Choose Titanium Camping ‍Cookware?

Before we delve into the reviews, let's explore why titanium⁣ has become the material of choice‍ for discerning ⁤outdoor adventurers. The advantages of titanium ⁣camping cookware sets are numerous:

* **Unmatched Lightweight ‍Design:** This is arguably the biggest draw. Titanium is considerably lighter than ⁢stainless steel or aluminum, ⁢making it ideal for backpacking and thru-hiking where every ounce counts.A lightweight ⁢camping cookware set can drastically improve your experience on the trail.
* **Exceptional Durability:** Despite its light weight,​ titanium is incredibly strong and resistant to corrosion. ⁤It can withstand the rigors of ​outdoor use, ​making‌ it a long-lasting investment. Durable camping cookware is a must-have for any serious camper.
* **Heat ‍resistance:** Titanium⁣ can withstand very high temperatures without warping or melting,making it suitable for cooking over⁤ campfires or stoves.
* **Non-Toxic and​ Biocompatible:** Titanium is naturally non-toxic and doesn't react with food,⁢ ensuring safe and healthy cooking.
* **Rust Resistance:** Titanium is naturally⁢ rust-proof, which is⁢ especially valuable in wet and humid camping conditions.
* **Space-Saving:** Compact camping cookware sets ​often utilize nesting‌ designs, minimizing ⁤the space they occupy in‍ your backpack.

## Key Considerations When choosing a ⁣Titanium Camping Cookware Set

Beyond the specific product recommendations, here are some key factors to consider when selecting a‍ titanium camping cookware set:

* **Intended ​Use:** How will you primarily use the‌ cookware? Backpacking requires ⁢a‌ diffrent set than car camping.
* ‌**Number of people:** How many people‌ will you be cooking for? Solo trips require smaller sets than group camping.Consider a camping cookware set for two if you frequently camp with a partner.
* **Weight‌ and Packability:** If you're backpacking, ‌weight is paramount. Look for the lightest and most compact option possible. The ability to nest pieces together is a huge plus for‌ packability.
* **Heat Distribution:** While titanium isn't known for even heat distribution, ⁣some sets incorporate features to mitigate this ​issue.Consider sets with thicker bases or ⁤laminated construction.
* **Features:** Do you need a non-stick coating? A lid? Folding handles? Consider the​ features that are most important ​to ⁤you. Non​ stick titanium cookware camping is⁢ ideal for ease of cleaning when water is scarce.
* ⁤**Budget:** Titanium cookware can be⁣ expensive.Set a budget and stick to it. Consider a ⁢titanium mess kit camping if budget and simplicity are priorities.
* **Durability:** Consider the thickness of titanium and how⁢ it's constructed. Thicker titanium will generally be more durable but also heavier. ​Look for welds and joints that are solid and well-crafted.⁢ This contributes to overall durable⁤ camping cookware.

To ensure the longevity of your investment, proper care⁢ and maintenance are essential:

* **Cleaning:** Clean your titanium​ cookware after each use with ‍soap and water.Avoid⁤ abrasive cleaners or scouring pads,⁣ as they can scratch the surface.
* **Heating:** Avoid overheating empty titanium cookware. This can‍ damage the metal‌ and cause warping.
*‍ **Storage:** Store your cookware in a dry place to prevent corrosion. Consider using ‍a protective bag⁣ or case to prevent scratches during transport.
* **Avoid Metal Utensils:** Use ​silicone or wooden utensils to avoid scratching the titanium surface.
* **Heat Distribution:** Use a low⁢ to ​medium heat setting when ‍cooking on a camp stove or campfire.This will help prevent hot spots and ensure even cooking.

## Tips for Cooking with Titanium Cookware

Cooking with titanium requires a slightly different⁢ approach than cooking⁣ with traditional cookware materials. Here are some tips to help you succeed:

* **Use Lower Heat Settings:** Titanium heats up quickly,so it's best to use lower heat settings to avoid burning your​ food.
* **Stir Frequently:** Stir your⁢ food frequently to ensure even cooking ⁤and prevent sticking.
* ⁢**Add Oil ⁤or Water:** Add a small amount of ⁢oil or water to the cookware before heating to help prevent‍ food​ from sticking.* **Use a Heat Diffuser:** If you're cooking ‍on a gas stove,consider using a heat diffuser to distribute ⁣the heat more evenly.

— This change wouldn’t be as annoying, if you could actually choose when you activate the triple boost. For some reason it activates during the 1st lesson of the day for me, which i usually do in the morning over coffee and rarely have time for more…

2. Advance - remain - demote -brackets changed?? Whyyyy???! 😭
— Being the color prefer-ist that I am, I’ve enjoyed 43 weeks of obsidian. Usually aiming to keep myself around 10th-15th place to guarantee not getting promoted or demoted.

My anxiety spiked to high heavens and I’m feeling my motivation drain cause the obsidian league streak has been a bigger motivation for me than the day streak, and not I feel like it’s a bigger source of anxiety and stress than anything else…

Anyone know if duolingo has given reasons for these changes? Or are they just testing new stuff? I’m currently on a yearly super sub, but considering ending that upon next renewal and deleting the whole thing with the increased anxiety factors….

I'm a 6' 2"" male and started at 270lbs. I was somewhat active playing golf and sand volleyball at least once a week, but I was becoming frustrated by not performing how I wanted to and I knew my weight was holding me back. I was also growing increasingly concerned with my health as I get older (currently 38) and as a husband and father of 3 I owe it to them to be around as long as possible. I went into this journey with a lot of focus, determination and discipline. I didn't spend any mental capacity feeling sorry for myself, blaming myself, forgiving myself, etc. My only mindset was *it's time to change*.

What worked for me:

* I cut out all alcohol
* I didn't drink any calories for the first few months (only black coffee, water, and 0 calorie electrolyte drinks)
* I weighed myself only once a week on injection day, and always at the same time of day.
* I was very aware of the calories I was consuming. Over time it became a skill and I've been able to mentally track and stay acutely aware of how many calories I'm consuming.
* The only macro I cared about was protein.
* I stayed hydrated. This meant more than drinking enough water. It meant getting enough electrolytes to stay hydrated.

What I would do different:

* I wish I focused more on protein in the beginning. I started focusing more on a higher protein diet after a few months.
* I wish I started consistently working out and lifting weights early on.

What's next?

Today was my last ZB injection as my insurance has stopped covering ZB and is only covering Wegovy now. Since I have reached my goal weight, and some, I talked to my Dr and we agreed it's time to start weaning myself off and prepare myself to start living a more consistently health style without GLP1. So I'll be scaling back to a much lower dose of Wegovy for a few months before cutting it off completely. This has always been my goal, and I'm so grateful for this medicine to get me back on track.",3,1741289633.0,Zepbound,1,0.71,False

She's lovely - we get on great.  
I asked her out a few weeks back, she said no and she said she didn't think it was a good idea to date a coworker - no problem and yeah you're probably right.  
She then started talking about a guy who broke up with her, I sort of cut her off and said how I wasn't interested in talking about love life and being friends with a girl who I'm interested in.

  
I sort of went back on that for a while but snapped out of it recently - we still chat at work, but she constantly texts me and trys to continue the conversation on into the evening/weekend - we've ended up on 3 hour long phone calls in the past.  
I've also gotten busier at work so overall we're not talking much.

She's commented on this. Saying things like 'I'm ignoring you', 'you're like a little teenager ignoring a girl!' or 'you're being so annoying!'. I mean she will physically cover her face as she walks by me and giggles all the while, then we have a quick chat.   
She'll look over at me and smile or wave, she'll look at me when something happens and starts giggling, she's got a nickname for me that she's using quite a bit. A few weeks back she had a habit of flicking water at me when we passed one another.

She's already said she's not interested and even though I still am and can't help that - I do agree it's probably not wise to date a coworker.  
But I also don't want to be friends with a girl who I'm attracted to.

On top of all that I'm now taking over for a senior guy on our team, I'm a lot busier and I'm taking on a lot of responsibility. In the past others have made jokes (just poking fun) about the two of us - that we're flirting and what not and whilst I didn't really care at the time, I do now that it could come back to bite me.   
Now that I'm responsible for more at work the last thing I want is someone being dismissive about the job I'm doing because 'ah well if you weren't so busy flirting with ...'   
I said that to her awhile back and she just thought it was funny and said who cares what they think.

Even now, I think it looks like flirting even if it's not. So it's more so the in person stuff that's the problem - going to grab a coffee, passing in the office etc. But I don't want to just text away as friends into the sunset.

I sort of get the impression she's interested, more so I get the impression she's interested but won't pursue anything because we work together. I'm not saying I wouldn't, I'm just saying I know it's not a good idea, but we do get on great. I'm just not okay with settling for friendship.

Personal Notes: In the first script I decided to shift her playful nature in favour of comfort, but this time I wanted to show more of her playfulness.

Compared to part 1 I changed the formatting a bit:

Part 1 still has chapter divisions, part 2 has not. Initially, I created chapters hoping each would fit on a single A4 page in the PDF, but that never really worked out. So I cheated by manually adjusting page lengths to make it work. Since I'm adjusting page lengths anyway, it makes more sense to create one continuous document for the entire script rather than managing multiple pages. So Chapter divisions no longer serve any practical purpose for me, and since they're kind of uncommon (at least in the scripts that I've read), I no longer create chapters

I no longer differentiate between ""Tone & Delivery"" and ""Voice Emphasize"" sections. They're not identialical but similar enough, so I just put them all together in ""How do I imagine the Speaker"" I also stay a bit more concise in this section, because the script itself already provides ample voice cues and sound effects, so it's a bit redundant.

It is surrounded by miles and miles of woodland, making it extremely easy to drive past. Most people don’t even know it exists and those who do, know not to stay in any of our rooms. With such a small clientele, I have no idea how this place stays in business. I’m even more surprised that the cops aren’t banging down our door and putting my supervisor and I in handcuffs. Maybe these stories will be the evidence needed for that to finally happen…it’ll be surreal to sit in a courtroom and have my own words read back to me by the prosecution.

Anyway, let's get into how I got this job and then start spoon feeding the prosecution the easiest convictions they’ve ever had.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m a seasonal worker here at the Mitten Motel. I applied here for two reasons. First, I didn’t know anything about this place when I put in my application. Second, I was recently kicked out of my parents house and was on my own.

I slept on park benches for a few weeks before seeing the ‘HELP WANTED’ ad on a newspaper I stole off my parents front porch. I meant to just take it and throw it out as a final middle finger to my father who couldn’t start his day without a cup of coffee and the paper. But, when I went to toss it in the trash I saw the ad on the back. Seeing that I could have a roof over my head as I got back on my feet, I jumped at the chance. 

After hitchhiking my way to the motel, I was finally able to see it in all of its glory. It was a single level motel with ten rooms. The bright red doors clashed with the puke green paint that was peeling from the building’s brick exterior. A single large window faced out towards the road and I noticed there were only two cars in the parking lot. 

A bell hanging from the door frame rang as I entered the area marked as the check-in office. My soon to be supervisor, Dale, glanced up at me from behind a computer that came fresh out of the early 2000’s. The room was pretty much just a glass box, with each wall (except the one behind Dale) being made up of large windows. The room smelled like someone had just poorly cleaned up a dead body, making the air heavy with the scent of chemicals and death. The kind of smell you get at a nursing home.

Dale's eyes slipped back to the screen in front of him as his gruff voice cut through the silence between us. “What do you want?”

I frowned a little at his comment and walked up to the desk, “I want a job. I saw your ad in the paper and–”

“No you don’t.” Dale cut me off, still not looking up from his screen. I tried to peek at what he was doing but I couldn’t get a good enough angle.

“Yes I do. I’ve worked in the service industry before–”

“No. You. Don’t.” Dale simply stated again. Even though the credentials that were about to spill from my lips were false, his rejection made me even more determined to get the job.

I leaned over the desk and closer to him, trying to burn a hole through his head with my eyes. “Okay, tell me how you know I don’t want the job.”

Dale’s eyes drifted to my face lazily. I tried to read his expression, as I’m sure he was trying to read mine. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get a read on his emotions. He was like a blank canvas. The silence between us hung heavily on my mind, as if trying to suck more words from my mouth, more arguments, more urging, more pleading. But I bit my tongue and forced myself to continue the staring contest with Dale.

“Alright.” He let out a sigh. I could tell he wasn’t convinced, but I was willing to prove myself to him. He waved me over to the other side of the desk. I rounded the corner, just in time to see him minimize a paused Galaga game. He pulled up an employee form and printed it out. A printer under his desk sprung to life as he pulled out a key from one of the drawers. “Your room is number 6…” He dropped the key into my hand, “And this is the form you need to fill out for your employment.” He picked up the warm print and handed it to me. “If you can last the night and return this to me by morning, you’re hired.”

I chuckled a bit, “last the night? What do you mean?” Dale didn’t even smile back as he looked up at me. Again, silence hung between us before Dale turned back to his computer. I shuffled a bit awkwardly, “O…Okay, I-I’ll see you in the morning.” I chuckled again more to relieve nerves than anything else. Wordlessly, I turned and walked out of the door. Dale must have turned the volume on the computer back on, because under the tone of the door bell I heard the distinct sounds of Galaga.

The room itself wasn’t anything special. Like every motel it had two beds, a bathroom, a closet, and a tv sitting on top of a dresser. I didn’t have much besides the clothes on my back so that dresser wasn’t going to get used anytime soon. I was also pleasantly surprised not to find any bed bugs hiding anywhere. The rest of the day was pretty mundane. I filled out the form Dale had given me, walked around and found where the vending machines were, flicked through the channels to find my favorites, and mindlessly scrolled through my phone.

A while later I was ripped from scrolling when loud bangs shook my door. I quickly sat up, nearly jumping out of my skin, my eyes flying to the door. I sat in silence waiting for whoever knocked to do it again. The slamming came again but on another door further down the row of rooms, followed by feet running past my door and the hushed giggles of children. '*Fucking kids'*, I thought to myself as I laid back down and pulled out my phone. 

The banging came again sending my phone flying into the air. It landed softly on my bed as my eyes immediately shot to the door. However, as I waited to hear the giggling and running again, a thought slipped from my subconscious into my consciousness, like an air bubble rising to the surface of calm water. And just like that bubble, the realization sent ripples through my mind and body. My hands became clammy and my throat dried up, as I peeled my eyes away from my front door, and turned to look at my bathroom door. '*I had to have heard that wrong…Right?'* My world tossed and turned like a ship during a storm. I didn’t trust my balance enough to pick up my feet, so instead I shuffled towards the bathroom door. I reached out, my logical side berated me for my irrational fear. It told me that I was crazy. There was no way into this bathroom other than the door that was now right in front of me. But my illogical side told me what I heard must have been true, and it was much, much louder than my logical side. 

My hand wrapped around the knob. I could feel my muscles tensing as if trying to stop me from making any movements to open the door. My body seemed to know that whatever was on the other side was dangerous, it didn’t want me to open it. At this point, both the illogical and logical parts of me were in a harmonious cry to find out what was in the bathroom. One wanted to prove there was nothing to fear, and the other wanted to prove there was. 

My body and mind were in tug of war, as I began to force the knob to turn. But I didn’t even get far enough to unlatch the door before my feet moved on their own. I dove back like I had touched a live electrical wire. I stared at the closed door. My mind had been silenced. All I could hear was the pounding of my heart and my gasps for breath, like I had just ran a marathon. I took a shaky shuffle back before all hell broke loose. Pounding started at my front door again, much louder than before. But somehow, the laughter was even louder. It sounded like children with megaphones were standing around me in the room screaming and laughing. Then the pounding slowly moved from the door to the left wall, then behind me. The pounding circled around my room getting faster and faster, louder and louder. The noise from the children seemed to grow as well. All I could do was tightly push my hands against my ears. I closed my eyes and tried to scream, but I couldn’t hear it over all the noise.

Then suddenly, it stopped. Like someone had just pressed pause on a movie. All at once the sounds disappeared. 

I must have curled up into a ball at some point, because when finally I dared to open my eyes, I was looking up at the now open bathroom door. It was empty just like the rest of the room. Nothing seemed out of place. I would have thought it was all in my head if it weren’t for the blood dripping from my ringing ears and my sore throat.

The rest of my sleepless night was spent sitting in the corner of the room. I didn’t even bother to wash the blood off my hands because I didn’t trust that bathroom anymore. The sun must have been up for a few hours before I even trusted the front door enough to walk out.

Despite the night's events, I was still desperate for a job and a place to stay. So the first thing I did was walk into that check-in office and hand Dale the form. I felt some pride when the first bit of emotion he showed me was surprise. His face quickly slipped back into its usual blank look as I handed him the form. He took it without even glancing at the bloody hand print I had left behind.

He dug around his drawer again after setting the paper down on his desk. pulling out another key, he handed it to me, “this is your employee key. It gives you access to everything you will need while working here. Don’t lose it. You will start after you get yourself cleaned up.”

1j53ndv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j53ndv/women_help_me_understand_why_you_choose_to_not/,Women - help me understand why you choose to not respond,"Throughout my years of pursuing women, I have learned quite a bit about them. That said, there is one thing that consistently leaves me scratching my head - the question of ""why did she not respond?""

In general I like to form theories and then test them when I don't understand something. This has served me well in the context of dating and women. However, the question posed above is unanswerable and untestable. I am a big fan of asking women questions directly to understand their feelings and thoughts, even when I have been rejected. This allows me to be better and have a better understanding in the future. However, when a woman doesn't respond, there is no learning or understanding to be had. You are left alone with your thoughts, feelings, and untestable theories for what went wrong (if anything).

One recent example that illustrates this well: I meet the girl for a coffee date. Everything is going well, good conversation, apparent physical chemistry. Go to the park. Walk around after the park. The girl says ""what are you doing today? I don't really have anything going on."" A very good sign. She wants to spend even more time together after an already long date. I am feeling a bit drained and after walking around a bit more we wrap things up. She earnestly informs me that she wants to see me again and gives me a long hug. It feels like a done deal. I can sense the genuineness of her interest and affection. Something like 5 days later I hit her up again and propose another meet up. Radio silence. I send a follow up text a week or two later. I move on and pursue other girls. A month or so later she pops into my mind and I am just genuinely curious what was going on in her mind, so I send her a voice note and say that I don't mean to bother her and am not trying to get her out on a date, but just am curious how she felt and why she lost interest. Radio silence.

Why couldn't she just send a brief response to either the text or the voice note? Just a flat out ghost always feels a bit dehumanizing. I never do that to women and so I frequently get irked when they do it to me. I have gotten better at shrugging it off, but I can't lie and say it doesn't affect me. I crave a nice clean rejection from a confident, kind, and direct woman, but it is unfortunately a rare occurrence.

Some possible theories:

* The girl is busy and doesn't owe me a response so she doesn't send one
* The girl is afraid I will get angry and act out if she rejects me directly
* The girl found someone better and doesn't want to tell me to avoid hurting me

So yeah, women of reddit - why do you not respond to guys? Specifically guys you have met in person and felt/expressed interest in initially? If you have responded in these sorts of situations, how have guys taken it? Have you ever regretted it?

Obviously there are a variety of reasons why someone would not text back, so there is not one single answer, but my post is meant to solicit a variety of common reasons for myself and other men to understand which are the most common. I think the world is a better place when men and women understand each other.",0,1741288944.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

1j53mkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/piscesastrology/comments/1j53mkk/what_wasis_dating_like_for_you/,what was/is dating like for you?,"i feel like we just attract the oddest people and people get attached to us so quickly??. i’d love to hear your crazy 1st date stories/how you used to or still navigate the dating world. 

here’s mine 

i met this guy at a kava bar/lounge, we hung out around the same people. he was very clearly flirting with me and i at the time definitely just liked the attention since my on and off ex had just moved across the country for college. i ended up deciding i’d let him take me out. i mean he started showing up at my work, a coffee shop, with coffee and treats every single day. so i was like why not?! 

well the “date” ended up being him coming over while i dog sat. and him explaining how he wants no strings attached, not a relationship guy, the classic. and i told him well i’m a relationship girl so we’ll see how this goes. we ended up just hooking up, and then for HOURS, he just talked about himself. didn’t even take a breath for me to say more than mhmm. anyway my spidey senses went off and felt like this was just trouble. not even how you were thinking of the situationship bit but more than that. so as i had just met him that week and we went out, and he wasn’t wanting a relationship i thought it would be okay to just text him and say hey idk if this is gonna work out. a little longer but no more than a 3 sentence explanation of “i don’t think we connect in a romantic way”.

he said k and blocked me on everything lol. which this would all be kinda normal behavior except we still hung out at the same place. he was fine with me at first but as we started getting closer to this group, my friend started talking to one of the other guys, i became good friends with another. the guy i went out with, we’ll call him Kitten lol, ended up booking an acting job so he stopped coming around as much or if he did at all it would be the very end of the night at like 1/2am. i remember one night he came and i was pretty high (pot). and he started venting to me about how all the tech team hated him and i was a tech in theater in school and professionally at the time so everything he was ranting about he was in the absolute wrong lol. i forget everything he said but i remember thinking just don’t say anything you don’t have the energy to argue rn. anyway i continued with the uh huh nods to let him know i was listening and then he started throwing his taco bell trash at me for not listening/being bored. 

at this point my friend and her guy has seen this and stands up for me but the other guy friend has yet to see it and thinks we’re being a bit dramatic. abt a month later kitten starts wearing halloween masks and just these scary get ups. people would say something abt it but he would just do a whole thing. there’s a bunch of small little tiffs we’d get into or my friends guy would get into with him but little things. and somehow the other guy friend has still yet to see anything. he was always getting a drink, using the bathroom or simply not there yet. 

so the guy friend, sweetest guy i’ve ever met, i guess started having a thing for me. and we had great conversations, it was one of those situations of i want to like him so bad bc he’s good for me. so one night he put his arm around me in front of kitten. kitten was not happy and i wasn’t expecting it. he ended up putting his head down and then made a stink about leaving. at this point no one really cared or tried to figure out what was wrong bc there was alwaysss something wrong or his feeling were always hurt from something. but this guy and i had a cute little night, he ended up teaching me to play chess. and when we were done we went back to our friends and my bsf’s guy said “don’t look now but kitten has been sitting right behind you guys this whole time, laughing manically and making these scary faces.” i don’t know how neither of us noticed him, i mean to be fair it was pretty busy and loud so i could barely hear the guy i was hanging with. but when he cued me to i looked and he was sitting at the table right behind us facing away doing exactly what he described. it was very scary/disturbing 

he actually texted all of us. 
he texted my bsfs guy “get a load of her, eh?”
my bsf i forget what he said
me “i love your beautiful lies”
and the guy friend “be careful with her, she’ll break you” or something like that

so instead of creating a big scene like he obviously wanted, i said let’s go outside and just get away from him and let him cool off.

everything was fun and fine, my bsf was moving out of the country soon so we really just wanted to enjoy this short lived group for what it was. at one point i went back inside to order a black tea and Kitten came up to the guy ordering in front of me. i just minded my own and then he turned around to me and said “how many times were you gone lie to me” which to be fair i told him 3/4 months prior when we originally were seeing each other for less than a week that i wasn’t ready for anything serious like i thought i was when he later pushed as to why it wasn’t vibing for me. which was true at the time. he started fire asking me questions and at one point i just forgot about my tea as i’m now being cornered in a public place and said

 “fine i’m a liar, i’m a bitch, can you leave me alone now” 

and he said “thanks but no” and continued to press his chest against my shoulder while i raced back to my friends and right before he was about to be in eye view of our friends he stopped and SCREAMED “you’re a lying fucking skank”.

now this is the first and only time i’ve seen red. i don’t remember anything else i said except screaming back and pressing against him now “say that again. no you’re so big now say that again” brought out the white trash in my dna lol. 

he ended up frantically packing up his stuff and i went out to my friends shocked, shaking and light headed. all i said was “guess i’m a lying fucking skank” lol. they ended up walking out there but he just ran. in the 20 seconds between me walking out and telling them and them coming in he was already in his car zooming out the parking lot (which is a trek he had to have sprinted). 

i’ve seen him since and he acts like nothing ever happened and that we’re old friends. and i’d rather never put myself in another confrontational situation like that ever again so i just hi and bye and that be that. 

but i have a million stories similar to this, and i’ve noticed as a reader us little pisces babies find ourselves with narcissistic, toxic relationships more than most. definitely grateful i’ve been in a healthy relationship for almost 2 years now. but i was just curious what your crazy stories are, and why you think we attract such bizarre people. i will say these situations made me protect myself and energy 10x more.",0,1741288888.0,piscesastrology,0,0.5,False

1j53m1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j53m1c/husband_nanny_post/,Husband & nanny post,"I was not able to comment on the post about the husband making the nanny feel uncomfortable, but I actually have a story of my own. 

Before I had kids, I was about 21 in school part time & I nannied for 3 different families to pay my way through school. The one family was a friend of my sister & she had one little boy. From the get go the parents were nice, or so I thought. I would take the little boy to the playground & come home to eat lunch & nap. The first time I went in their basement was a red flag that 21yo me tried to ignore. The dad had playboys & hustlers all over the coffee table & side table. Like stacked. Whatever I thought not my business. The child was 2 so he didn’t really understand & we just played with his toys. 

Fast forward, the dad started “working from home” more. He kept coming to talk to me when I’d be feeding the boy. One day, I came back to their house from a walk with the boy & was going upstairs. I was grabbing a change of clothes & looked to my left - the dad was full out masterbating with the door open. I was so freaked out & scared I grabbed the clothes, ran out of the house & put the boy in his car seat. I called the mom & let her know I would absolutely NOT be coming back & if she could meet me so I could transfer her son & his car seat. She had me drop the son off to her parents. 

She then called me & told me that she talked to her husband & he told her that wasn’t true. She accused me of lying. I was sobbing. I felt so disgusting & sick over it. 

Bottom line: if the nanny felt uncomfortable, believe her. She may not even feel comfortable enough to tell you what happened. 

TLDR: saw the dad of a kid I nannied for masterbating with the door open completely nude. & also, they had a dog so he heard the dog bark when I came in & I made my footsteps known when I came up the stairs. ",77,1741288848.0,Marriage,12,0.91,False

1j53k5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1j53k5j/weaning_off_lexapro_withdrawal_experience/,Weaning Off Lexapro: Withdrawal Experience,"Hi everyone, I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1j2xi4t/comment/mg87u50/?context=3) on here about getting back on Lexapro two months after weaning off.  I want to share what my weaning off / withdrawal experience was like for those interested.

For background, I was on 15 mg Lexapro for a little over 3 years. It helped me a lot with my OCD (trichotillomania), depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. I was diagnosed and prescribed Lexapro by my physician. I started on 5 mg and eventually went up to 15 mg. The only issues I had taking Lexapro were feeling like I couldn't cry (unless something terrible happened) and sometimes feeling indifferent to things that would usually make me emotional (not always a bad thing). No panic attacks on Lexapro. No weight gain.

The biggest mistake I made is when I started thinking, how long am I going to be on this drug? Am I going to be relying on this prescription drug for the rest of my life? And then decided to wean off, with my doctor's approval. I weened down to 10 mg for two weeks, then 5 mg for two weeks, then completely off the drug. I do wonder if I weaned off too quickly. I see some people on here that wean off by 2.5 mg increments. The withdrawal symptoms were very bad. After two months, I've decided to go back on Lexapro. Being off of it for two months has made me realize how the medication helped me, and I'll never take it for granted again. **Here are the symptoms I went through during/after getting off Lexapro**:

* Racing thoughts, doomsday thinking (everything is going to turn out the worst possible way)
   * Especially at night
* Irritability
* Rage
* More overstimulated than usual - volume on people’s phones, TVs, music, talking, laughing, dogs, fans, bother me more
* Pulling out my split ends and hair more. Much harder to stop once I start, like I’m frozen in time
* Disassociation - moments where it feels like nothing around me is real or meaningful
* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Brain zaps - feels like a light shock sensation in my head
* Headaches
* Crying much more, seeing everything that is negative about people and the world
* No desire to smile or even fake it
* Less silly and carefree
* Less motivation to be successful
* Hard to shower, cook, clean, do work, keep exercise routine
* Low appetite - don’t want breakfast, less appetite even if I’m hungry
* Extra sensitivity to caffeine - racing heart, doomsday thoughts
* Takes longer to fall asleep
* Hard to focus on a conversation, feels like I am being spoken at and I respond passively
* Trouble sleeping (falling asleep and high heart rate)
* Obsessive thinking
* Extra sensitivity to caffeine - racing heart after one cup of coffee - be careful with caffeine intake when weaning off

Obvious disclaimer - I'm not a doctor, I'm in grad school and these symptoms made doing work so much harder. Also disclaimer, I understand that withdrawal symptoms are not the same for everyone, but some of those seem very common based on what I've researched. Talk to your prescriber for your particular situation. This is not to dissuade anyone from going on or off Lexapro, I just wanted to share my experience.

The physical symptoms like dizziness, vertigo, headaches, and brain zaps, only lasted for about two weeks, thank god. But the mental effects have lasted ever since. After talking to my therapist, doctor, and loved ones, I've decided that going back on it is the best decision for me. I started at 5 mg yesterday, and felt a bit nauseous and had a little bit of disassociation, but besides that I haven't felt horrible \*knock on wood\*.

I hope this is informative for someone.",3,1741288719.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

Background

I (m21) have been with my girlfriend (f31) for off and on 3 years now. We are pretty strong as a couple, but recently there is an issue that we just can't seem to agree on.

For context, we do not live together, but my girlfriend lives in the same apartment complex that I do, just in a different building, and is over most nights

  
I am a person who sometimes has a hard time separating frustration from work, the drive (crazy drivers are where I'm at, I drive between 30 minutes to an hour each way on the highway) and home. Now, this isn't always an issue, I'd say it gets bad maybe once a month or maybe twice, where work and the drive sucked so badly that I either need a night to myself or if my girlfriend wants to come over, I give her a warning I may not be pleasant company, as a courtesy. This happened yesterday, as I was run off the road by someone on their phone on my way to work, then had to deal with that one co worker that everyone has that no one likes lol. 

  
So needless to say, I was pretty tight around 4pm and I still had 3 hours left in my shift. I shoot my gf a text and let her know that today is a day where I'm pretty heated and I'd understand if she doesn't want to hangout. She said she understood, and thanked me for informing her.

  
We call while I'm on the way home as we usually do and we talk some about what got me heated and we are doing decently. I'm not expressly mad, just mostly tired and a tad short at this point. She said she still wanted to come over, which I was fine with, as I had already warned her and she has been around while I've been like this before and it is usually fine. I hang up when I get home so I can cook myself dinner, we usually do food separate (usually in the same house though) as we have very different pallets. I am cooking, and the usual window for when she would come over has gone past 30 minutes. I text her to make sure she's okay and after not receiving a response for around 15 minutes ish, I call her. (this wasn't me trying to be a way, I just wanted to know if she was coming over so I would know if i should stay up for her. I go into work pretty early.)

  
She answers, and we get to talking. Things are fine on her end, but she says she doesn't really feel like leaving her house. I say that I completely understand, especially considering the circumstances. No hard feelings on my end, but I notice as we still talk for a few moments that she is withdrawn.  I ask what's going on, and eventually she tells me that she's sad I didn't say I wanted her over when she said she didn't want to come over. I respond that she gave very valid reasons as to why she didn't want to leave her house, that alone is enough for me to not press about her coming over. She gave me a reason and I wasn't going to be selfish and push through. I told her that, and I was told again that she didn't understand. I expressed again that she gave me a perfectly valid reason with not wanting to leave and that I respect her autonomy and didn't want to pressure or push, because she clearly has a good reason to stay home.

  
This caused a minor disagreement where we went somewhat back and forth, without raising our voices or anything, but it got somewhat heated. I still think I did nothing wrong, and especially given the mental space I was in, I was not wrong for how I handled it. Am I wrong? 

  
For context, I only am this concerned about it because she has a bad habit of turning things like this into full blown issues later, so when I see a problem, I would like to at least hear her side and know where she is coming from so we can both be heard by the other person and know that we see each other. I only explained myself as persistently as I did, as it seemed like she was trying to get why it seemed like I didn't want to see her.

Another piece of context, I do not go to her apartment. She is a tad bit anal about her house, which I am not as. It is completely fine that we have different boundaries, but I do not think I could handle how she usually gets about her house when I am already upset. ",2,1741288676.0,AITAH,25,0.75,False

1j53gzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j53gzw/there_is_something_wrong_with_my_new_phone/,There is something wrong with my new phone,"So last week my new phone arrived. First day I got it I did all the setup bullshit. Sign in to Google, transfer my number, redownload all my apps, transfer pictures and videos, make sure all my accounts are logged in. Typical stuff. I didn't buy a case or screen protector since I'm on a bit of a budget lately. I value eating more than anything. And before you ask why I bought a new phone on a budget, my old phone stopped holding a charge. Not much of a mobile phone if it has to be plugged in to use it. Whatever. I have a new one now. It should work fine as long as I don't drop it. Knock on wood.

Update: Last night I was eating some leftover lamb and I heard a weird noise. I slipped my phone into my back pocket and sat down at the kitchen table. Pretty much as soon as I sat down I heard a prolonged grunting noise coming from my phone. No, I wasn't watching anything weird. I was reading an article about various factors that affect the trout population in the midwestern United States. I took my phone Out of my pocket and looked at the screen. It was turned off, but the noise continued. I guess that's what I get for buying the cheapest phone available.

Update: Today I was scrolling through reddit, just checking out r/gamecollecting coveting other people's belongings while sipping my coffee, typical start to my day off work. I set my phone down for a second to refill my mug and when I came back the light next to the camera was on. If you didn't know this just tells me that the selfie camera is active. I've never had a phone with one before now so I figured I would explain. 

Update: This morning I woke up late. I slept through my alarm. I was going to call my boss but I saw in my call logs that a call was made around the time I went to sleep that lasted for several hours to a number I didn't recognize. I don't remember calling anyone. Did I do it by accident while I was asleep? I tried to call it again but all I got was a robot response telling me the number was no longer in service. Oh well.

Update: I found some blue dust around the base of my phone. I have no clue what it could be. Any ideas?

Update: I left my phone on the table next to a slice of buttered bread on a plate while I went to the bathroom. (yes I washed my hands) When I came back there was a noticeable amount of the bread missing as well as crumbs between the plate and my phone.

Update: Today I left my phone on the charger while I went to shower. When I walked into the room I saw a small circular head peaking on the side of my phone. It was red and with yellow eyes that were closer to the sides of its head than they were to each other. It was no larger than my pinky but I know I saw it.

Update: Typing this on my computer. I put my phone in a jar with some salt and rat poison. I don't care what happens to it now. I have backups of the pictures on my computer. I'll just get a new phone when I have more money. Last time I buy a phone from tracfone. Not sure if I should bury the jar or toss it in the ocean. Maybe just burn the phone? Idk.

The Celestial Coalition's Universal Dictionary 32nd Century Fifth Edition describes a deathworlder as a member of a deathworld species, which is a species that has evolved (or otherwise came to be) on a world with a danger rating of at least five. These worlds often feature hostile climates, intense gravity, large temperature gradients, dangerous weather systems, or predatory indigenous wildlife. In worlds with higher danger ratings, on average, many of these threats are present simultaneously across the planet. Deathworlders have adapted to survive these harsh conditions, which often gives them a very different bodily structure and appearance when compared to those from worlds with lower danger ratings. Deathworlders often appear predatory in nature. One should observe deathworlders carefully before making the assumption that they are truly predatory.

There is currently a single deathworld species with membership in the Celestial Coalition: Humanity. Refer to species classifications: human, homosapien.

Humanity hails from a level 17 death world. We are aware of the absurdity of the claim that their homeworld is above level 10, which is technically the beginning of the extinction world classifications. We have prepared several data points to back up our claim that the human deathworld is in fact a level 17 extinction world, but since humanity is not extinct, we have made an exception to this title and instead recategorized the planet as a death world with an exceptionally high danger rating.

Note that any translators that claim the humans' homeworld is called planet Dirt are incorrect. Do not refer to the human homeworld as planet Dirt. The humans consider the term planet Dirt to be a grave insult.

The gravity of their homeworld, Earth is 4.9 times standard coalition gravity. The humans do not consider their homeworld's gravity to be strong. They believe standard coalition gravity to be weak.

Earth regularly reaches temperatures ranging from 57 Celsius, which is more than halfway to the boiling point of water, all the way down to -92 Celsius, which is almost 100 Celsius below the freezing point of water. Humanity has settlements in the areas of the planet that commonly reach these extreme temperatures, and they survive these conditions without serious injury on a regular basis.

Earth does not have a solid crust. The planet is made up of what the humans call tectonic plates. Refer to planetary specifications: shifting crust, divided crust. These tectonic plates, which are large pieces of the planet's crust that float atop molten rock under the surface, constantly slam into each other without ever taking a break. The beautiful mountain ranges seen in many artists depictions of Earth's scenery are actually large pieces of tectonic plates that were forced upwards when two or more tectonic plates collided. That's right, the very crust of the planet is always moving, and it's constantly destroying itself.

Earth's atmosphere is so dense that water does not remain completely dissolved. Rainstorms are the most calm example of this: water condenses into clouds before small droplets begin falling from the sky and settling on the ground. The humans consider this phenomenon pleasant. It is not uncommon for clouds to form near the surface as something the humans call fog. This fog thickens the atmosphere so much that the very air feels wet. The water in the atmosphere impairs visibility and reduces your ability to determine your location and discern the location of nearby objects or lifeforms. This is particularly dangerous when you consider the wildlife indigenous to the planet.

Earth's atmosphere is so unsteady that it often flows inconsistently and regularly produces wind that is strong enough to knock over most everyday objects unless they are secured or otherwise held down. This is a daily occurance and humanity considers this normal. As the wind flows, it often gets caught in concentrated waves called gusts, which are sudden bursts of wind that can exceed 80 kilometers per hour on a regular basis. The humans consider this normal and do not fear wind gusts.

Earth's atmosphere is so unstable that it often produces storms which bring various hazards with them. Rainstorms are usually not considered dangerous, but when paired with intense wind along with other weather conditions, what initially appears to be only a rainstorm can quickly become something more dangerous:

Earth has a wildlife system composed of predators and prey animals. While this concept is not unique to Earth, the sheer effectiveness of the natural weapons wielded by what is considered an average predator on the planet Earth is most disturbing. Most predators employ some combination of the following natural weapons: venom that may paralyze or otherwise damage prey (refer to neural condition: paralysis, impaired neural function, impaired motor control, impaired mobility), teeth sharp enough to bite through the average prey animal with ease, jaws that produce bite forces strong enough to crush bones, claws sharp enough to remove limbs from prey, limbs strong enough to knock prey to the ground without damaging its own structure, and many more unique weapons including but not limited to the ability to spit acid and release toxic gasses.

In short: if the environment itself isn't trying to kill a human, a predator is probably trying to eat them. In many cases, both of these threats are present at the same time.

Humans evolved to not only survive in these conditions, but to thrive. On their home planet, humans are considered a class D4 prey animal due to their lack of natural defenses and their complete absence of natural weapons other than flat teeth. When factoring in their intelligence, humans become a class B6 prey animal with predatory instincts.

When compared to life outside their home planet, humans are considered a class A1 Apex Predators. All races, with or without membership in the Celestial Coalition, should be aware of the following human traits and differences:

1. Humans appear soft and squishy but are actually impressively durable. The human body utilizes an endoskeleton which is built on a highly complex, naturally occuring structure that is highly resistant to damage. Materials naturally occurring in human bones include calcium, iron, and a highly resistant material known to the humans as type 1 collagen fibers. Human bones are strong on the outside, and have softer insides where the bones themselves contribute to the body's production of blood and other bodily fluids necessary for human survival.
2. Healing. When the human body is injured, it immediately begins to repair itself. Common, non-serious injuries will heal on their own without medical intervention. A human may receive an injury that would cause a member of another race to immediately expire and simply consider it an inconvenience. In many cases, humans do not seek medical attention until enough time has passed that the human is convinced that their injury is not healing optimally on its own. This ability is so pronounced that human medicine mostly focuses on simply enhancing their natural healing abilities.
   1. When the human body is severely damaged, it responds by increasing its own natural healing abilities. When healing is not possible, the body may opt to allow a portion of itself to expire. In many cases, the expired portion remains attached to the body, but is no longer usable. When the expired portion is removed, either naturally or by force, the body responds by sealing the area where the body had connected to the expired portion that has been removed. This allows the human body to continue functioning normally despite the missing portion.
   2. Most organs within the human body have more than one duty. When one is damaged, becomes unusable or is removed, the other organs may slightly alter their functions in order to continue the tasks that would have normally been performed by the now unusable or missing organ.
3. The human immune system. Earth is not only home to large predators, but very small ones as well. Creatures on Earth are constantly under attack by tiny organisms known as bacteria, which infiltrate a larger creature and damage their internal processes in order to produce more bacteria. Viruses are another type of small life form with basically does the same thing as bacteria. An infection by a bacteria or a virus would be fatal to most members of the coalition, but to humans, it's nothing more than a small inconvenience. Their bodies are filled with tiny weapons designed to wage war against the infection, and they usually win without medical intervention. After an infection is purged, the human body does not dispose of these tiny weapons. By keeping these tiny weapons, the human body becomes immune to any future infections by the same virus or bacteria, as the body already has the weaponry necessary to combat and defeat the infection.
   1. The immune system can be tricked into creating weapons even when they are not strictly necessary. Humans create vaccines specifically designed to trigger the human body to create defensive weaponry against infection, despite their being no real threat of infection present. This causes an immune response and the affected human becomes immune to the specific virus or bacteria that the vaccine was created for. This works with moderate to astonishing consistency depending on the human in question. (Refer to bodily process definitions: bacterial defense, viral defense, immune system preparation, immune system alteration)
   2. The immune system can often overreact and damage the body. This is called a cytokine storm and can be fatal. That's right, the human body is capable of making tiny weapons so powerful that they can fatally damage the very human body that created them.
4. When scanned, the human brain is shown to have two main cortical hemispheres with a lower extension protruding downwards. While this may initially appear simple compared to many races with a high number of cortical hemispheres, the human brain's complexity is hidden in its internal structure.
   1. The human brain is designed to look for patterns and identify items at a blazing fast rate. This allows humans to quickly determine if they are in danger, or if they are safe. Their pattern recognition abilities, thanks to this evolutionary course, are off the charts. Humans often predict complex happenings before the beginning steps have even been completed.
   2. The human brain is separated into conscious and unconscious functions. While the human brain is constantly aware of all of its internal functions as well as all bodily functions, the human themselves are only aware of a small portion of these functions and processes. While the exact line where consciousness transitions to unconsciousness can be different from one human to another, there is a general consensus on how this process is expected to work. If a bodily process appears intriguing or abnormal, the brain will make the human aware of it, meaning the brain transitions is monitoring of that bodily process to a conscious area of the brain. Certain brain functions happen automatically and are completely separate from conscious areas of the brain, including but not limited to: survival instincts, fight or flight responses, reflexes, bodily processes that happen continuously, and a multitude of internal calculations. The human brain constantly tells the body when to breathe and when to beat its heart, but if a human is asked how they breathe, they can define the physical process through medical study, but the human will be unaware of their brain telling their body to breathe. The separation of conscious and unconscious processes is thought to be intended to free up conscious space within the brain, allowing more room for more conscious processes without impairing normal functions.
      1. The human brain is capable of impressively complex calculations. It performs these calculations at blazing speeds and does not immediately tire from this high level of activity. For example, humans who play baseball are regularly expected to be able to contort their body in a way that builds momentum in their core, using their legs to send a shockwave from the ground while their core adjusts to send this burst of movement to their shoulders, which amplify the movement and send it down the human's arms. This is a complex movement designed to do one thing: throw a ball as fast and accurately as possible. Humans can throw a ball in excess of 160 kilometers per hour and do so with enough accuracy to hit a target the size of a human chest from 18.5 meters away repeatedly without missing or falling short. The amount of internal calculations necessary to coordinate such a complex movement is nothing short of immense, but humans perform these movements as if they were natural and do not see the activity as strenuous.
      2. The human brain can withstand damage to one or both cortical hemispheres and still continue operating. In many cases, the brain restructures what is left after the injury. Different areas of the brain adjust their structure and operation to perform the processes that would have normally been performed by the now damaged areas of the brain. The brain may even repair itself, restoring function to damaged areas once healing is complete.
      3. The human brain stem is an area of the brain that protrudes downwards from the main cortical hemispheres. The brain stem provides unconscious control over the human body and mental processes. This is the area of the brain that commands unconscious operations and bodily processes. Its beauty is in its simplicity: while the upper cortical hemispheres are complex, the brain stem is designed for simple, immediate reactions to ensure survival in dangerous conditions. This is the area of the brain that triggers a human's Fight Or Flight response. The brain stem can even keep the mind and body alive on its own even when both cortical hemispheres have been damaged.
5. Adrenaline is a deadly toxin that the Celestial Coalition considers class 1 chemic contraband. This toxin can be used as a neural poison, to interrupt respiratory function, to cause the failure of one or more cardiac organs, to cause one's mind to race and cause disorienting sensations and potentially dangerous abnormal cortical activities, and to cause one's organs to burst from increased internal fluid pressure. Despite adrenaline's known adverse effects, the human body knowingly and intentionally produces adrenaline and stores it in the adrenal glands. When a human feels threatened, the adrenal glands release adrenaline into the blood. This is unique to humans. Do not consume or otherwise put adrenaline into your body... It will not end well. The presence of adrenaline in the human body creates the human Fight Or Flight response:
   1. Adrenaline causes the heart to beat faster and to beat more forcefully. It also causes blood vessels to constrict, raising blood pressure. This ensures that an overabundance of blood is available to all areas of the body at any given time. It also puts increased stress on the body by raising internal fluid pressures and stressing the main cardiac organ.
   2. Releases glucose from the liver, which raises blood glucose levels. This provides a sudden overabundance of high energy glucose to the body. Note that this increased activity level can be dangerous and there are even multiple diseases that involve the amount of glucose in the blood being unsteady.
   3. Dilates airways, allowing more air into the lungs. This raises blood oxygen levels at the expense of allowing more airborne contaminants to enter the lungs.
   4. Increases cortical activities and heightens awareness. This increases the brain's processing power, which allows for faster information processing and decreased reaction times while simultaneously raising the individual's awareness of their surroundings.
   5. Suppresses pain and fatigue, allowing the body to ignore injury and continue operating at peak performance even when damaged.
   6. Releases natural limiters that restrict muscle activity. When these limiters are released, the muscles in the human body are free to use their full strength without interference. This allows the human body to perform at much higher speeds and strength levels than normal, allowing for split second reactions and deliver devastating strikes in a fight for survival.
   7. When a human is experiencing a fight or flight response, they become even more efficient predators while their ability to protect loved ones is also greatly increased. The brain operates at a state of increased capacity while the body is able to demonstrate greatly increased speed and strength. This creates a feeling of invincibility within the human consciousness and reduces the caution a human would normally show in dangerous situations. Natural reflexes and primitive instincts become heightened, deepening a human's desire to fight back and/or protect whatever or whoever they have determined requires their protection.

Despite their primitive instincts and predatory home planet, the humans have a society that values peace and understanding. Humans are kind creatures by nature. They believe that friendship, respect and brotherhood are the most important traits in a successful society. As a result, their is a stark contrast between the human's predatory appearance and their peaceful intentions. Humans are a respected member of the Celestial Coalition. The next section covers human behaviors that differ from typical norms.

1. Humans are very social creatures. They will pack bond with basically anything. If you see a human become saddened when a simple cleaning droid breaks down, this is normal. The human likely pack bonded with the simple machine, considering it to be more than just a cleaning machine: a friend that they see every day performing basic cleaning tasks.
   1. Humans form very complex social structures and constantly adjust their position within said social structure. Humans normally have a single title like Commander or Science Officer, but in reality, the human in question is likely a member of many social groups outside of the duties of their assigned post. The humans consider this an important part of their social structure.
2. Humans deeply value the bonds they build with other creatures. Whether human or not, once a creatures becomes friends with a human, the human will bond with that creature as a valuable part of their social lives. Take that creature away from the human, and they will expect an explanation and in most cases, an apology.
   1. Do not use human social bonds against them. Humans are very kind creatures, but they have strong desires to protect those they care about. Humans are capable of displaying terrifying skill levels in many forms of combat. Taking hostages or threatening those a human has bonded with will trigger predatory responses. Do not use human social bonds to try to manipulate or otherwise interact with a human in a negative way. The results will likely be catastrophic, and the Celestial Coalition will not side with anyone who intentionally triggers human predatory responses.
      1. In cases where the human is objectively proven to have acted without provocation and caused damage that is not easily undone, the Grand Celestial Council will act to resolve the conflict in a safe and timely manner.
3. Humans consider danger to be fun. They find excitement and pleasure in performing dangerous activities. This is completely normal for the human race and should not be a source of concern. Take time to determine if an activity is reasonably safe for all races before partaking in activities that may appear to be dangerous. Remember, humans are far more durable than most other races. Do not place yourself in danger.
   1. If you are in a dangerous situation and cannot escape on your own, find a human. We understand that this is in stark contrast to the above point, but there is one thing we have consistently observed: someone under the protect of a human is much safer than those who do not have this protection.

  
With that out of the way, we wish to offer one more piece of wisdom.

Humans regularly consume a neural stimulant known as coffee. It makes them feel good and increases their mental capacity, although the exact effects can vary between individual humans. Do not take a human's coffee away from them or otherwise prevent them from obtaining and consuming coffee when they desire it. The results of ignoring this warning can be catastrophic.

  
Remember, humans are friendly by nature and will not act aggressively unless provoked. Even when a human is angry or is experiencing a Fight Or Flight response, the human is still aware of their surroundings and will prioritize the safety of all creatures and other items that they care about and/or have positive social bonds with.

When threatened or unsafe, seek human protection. Humans have a way of coming up with unorthodox solutions to problems, but we cannot deny the effectiveness of these solutions.",4,1741288460.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

An other thing would be a fancy drink, preparing the ice for the drink, mixing all together. Maybe setting up the lounge area to relax in.
Or some people like to use a razor blade old-school razor to shave that also takes time and concentration. But it's calming. 
It takes the stress and speed of the day away.

1j5394l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1j5394l/joe_k_part_17/,Joe K - Part 17,"Awaking to the sound of banging coming from the living room, K instinctively thought it was the police again. They must have read Goolie's article, decided the 'giant insect in a dress' had gone too far this time, and were back with their heavy boots on, determined to permanently squash him. He wished, in vain, that it was another mad dream, before realising the noise wasn't coming from inside his flat, it was someone knocking the door. He slipped into a dressing gown and got up to answer it, remembering at the last minute to put the chain on - a habit he had only recently acquired.

""Hey Joe, I've brought croissants,"" said Katie, in tight blue jeans and a Pixies t-shirt. She had her hair tied up, revealing the pale, Renaissance neck that drove him crazy. ""Oh, sorry babes, I thought you were an early riser.""

""What time *is* it?"" he said, letting her in and closing the door behind them.

""Nine-ish.""

""Wow... I might have slept well.""

""Well enough to be my knight in shining armour?""

""Will a pawn in a dressing gown do?"" She embraced him with such a squeeze that she discovered an unmistakable presence between them.

""Oh... I guess you are an early riser,"" she giggled, backing away.

""Shit, I'm sorry... it must be those pills... maybe."" He was desperately searching for any excuse and struggling to regain some composure, which only increased her amusement at his red-faced attempts to conceal any trace of the uninvited guest. Eventually, she took pity on him.

""I'll put the kettle on, you go and get dressed and... whatever else you need to do.""

Ten minutes later, K emerged from his bedroom, fully clothed and acceptably flaccid, if not completely recovered from his embarrassment, and adopting an overly formal tone that threatened to send Katie into another fit of giggles. ""Please forgive me, Katie. I promise it was just an instinctive, biological, semi-conscious... event I had no control over and I have no... intention of jeopardising our relationship with any overambitious, overamorous... overadventurous, overaroused, overadjectived... attempt to... cross the friend zone border and... are you stiffling a laugh? - I mean, are you...?"" That tipped her over the edge and all attempts to control her natural impulse deserted her - she burst into hysterics.

""I'm sorry, babes, but 'cross the friend zone border' - that was too much. I mean, it was all too much but that was too too much. Where did *you* even come across that terminology? Do me a favour and erase it from your lexicography, it could do with clear out, and that's such a terrible saying *and* a complete load of bollocks, there's no such thing as the friend zone - and if there was, it would just be the week between menstruation and ovulation, between the 'get the fuck away from me' zone and the 'won't take no for an answer' zone. Now, it's really not a big deal, so will you just bloody forget about it and stop saying you're sorry 'cause it's all we seem to be doing to each other lately.""

Over coffee and croissants, Katie explained that she'd just found out that one of her friends had been involved in a car accident and was in hospital recovering. She wanted to visit her before lunch, but needed K's support to help her cope with her nosocomephobia. ""The first time I went to see my mum, I feinted the minute the hospital air hit me, and, ever since then, I've avoided them as much as I can. I even insisted on a home birth... I can't even watch any medical stuff on the telly, which seems to be half of everything that's on the bloody telly.""

""If you're not really comfortable with this, I'm sure your friend will understand.""

""I'm not. We had a bit of a fight the last time I saw her and I don't want her to think I'm avoiding her. You don't mind coming along, do you? You don't have to come into the room, just get me that far."" K took a couple of leaping pills and leapt at the opportunity to display a small amount of chivalry, stopping short of re-donning Katie's colander in a new guise of knight-errant.

Whether his presence made any difference or not, she made it to her friend's bedside without any obvious discomfort. It was K who had a bit of a wobble in the elevator, and again when Katie, possibly to mitigate the chance of there being a scene, changed her mind and insisted on introducing him. Luckily, the patient, though badly bruised and with her arm in a sling, seemed pretty doped up and pleased to see her friend. Whatever bitterness she may have felt towards Katie had obviously been obliterated by the accident. K remembered to dispense with the expected comment of wishing they'd met under better circumstances and politely left them to it.

Waiting in the corridor, he spotted a nurse coming out of the elevator who looked more familiar than she ever had before. Could Veronica be wearing that uniform so she can steal drugs from the hospital to kill Ohm with? Keeping a safe distance, he followed her to a reception desk, where she stopped to ask what? for the key to the pharmacy? He considered walking straight up to them and alerting the receptionist, but wasn't sure if impersonating a nurse was even an offence. He had to catch her in the act of stealing the drugs, then he could raise the alarm before she got off the premises. While formulating this plan, he failed to notice that she was heading back down the corridor, directly towards him. If this was a comedy, there would be a trolley nearby with a sheet on it he could patiently hide under until she obliviously passed by, but all he could do was pretend to study a poster on the wall advising him to check his boobs. K realised he hadn't completely lost his invisibility superpower when she walked straight past him. He continued his surveillance, certain he was on to something when he spotted an overhead sign that included the word *Pharmacy* and an arrow pointing to the corridor she'd just turned into. Peeping around the corner, he saw her about twenty metres ahead of him, but he would have to be careful, there was very little activity to disguise his presence. He figured she would be vigilant, or paranoid, enough to look behind her at any moment, so he tried to partially eclipse himself behind a moon-shaped woman who'd stopped spying out the window and was helpfully heading towards him. Unfortunately, his own suspicious behaviour had attracted the woman's attention and she was looking straight at him. Then she was pointing straight at him, and K was expecting her to accuse him of being some kind of weird hospital pervert, when, instead, she said - ""I don't remember your name, but I remember your face from *The Afterglow*."" It was a voice that reverberated up and down the corridor and suggested that the state of her memory was of universal significance. ""It's so nice to see you getting some help, after all you've been through,"" the moon added, as if her own personal involvement in fighting his cause had finally been rewarded. ""Thank God for Pearl Goolie, I say, she'll be getting my vote for sure - Pearl's the girl for me!"" Over the moon's horizon, he caught a glimpse of the prematurely rumbled, and hence insubstantially incriminated, Veronica heading towards him.

""Joe? What are you doing here?""

""Joe! that's it!"" said the moon.

""What are *you* doing here?"" K fired back at her, with what he thought was the cool determination of the moral high-ground. The moon took a cautious step away from him, no doubt suspecting that, unless he was blind, Goolie's article had merely scratched the surface of his mental health problems, and addressed Veronica.

""Hello, nurse, I've not seen you in a long while, how are you?""

""You *work* here?"" K said to Veronica, before she could point her telescope at the moon.

""Yes!"" said the moon, who clearly didn't consider mental health problems to be any excuse for bad manners, and was probably reconsidering whether Pearl was the girl, after all.

""No,"" said Veronica, as if not just in answer to them both, but also a stern, yet polite, request for her bickering children to stop competing for her attention.

""No?"" said the moon, giving Veronica a quizzical look.

""I haven't worked here for six months,"" she explained. ""I'm doing private care now, I'm just visiting..."" The moon had suddenly been pulled into the orbit of a fleet-footed young doctor who had tried and failed to rush past unnoticed.

""Dr Jones... Dr Jones... have you had a chance to look at my MRI yet?...""

""Private care, huh?"" said K. ""Is that what you call it?""

""I didn't want to get into my budding legal career, we might have been here all day if the dishy doctor hadn't saved us.""

""You admit you're not a nurse, then?""

""Not any more I'm not. Rewarding, they say - my skinny arse it is. Thankless, exhausting and underpaid, more like. That's all behind me now, apart from the Ohm care, in addition to everything else I do for the useless old fucker - still, it's all helping to pay for my degree. He's been promising to make me a partner but, between you and me, he won't live long enough to see me qualify."" K couldn't believe his ears - was she actually boasting about killing him? ""Luckily for me, though, he's going to leave behind a portfolio of clients who all know who's really been running the show for the last six months. There's already a few lucrative offers on the table from some very reputable firms."" She *was* boasting about killing him, and that's means, motive and opportunity - you don't need to be a lawyer to work that out. ""Of course, your name is at the very top of that portfolio and when we find ourselves a new home from Ohm, you'll be represented by some of the best in the business, I'll see to that. I'm talking about lawyers that people like you - people like *us*, Joe - could normally never even dream of being able to afford. I'm talking about lawyers who can convince a jury that the bear didn't shit in the woods. I'm talking about lawyers, Joe, who can leave an entire courtroom waiting until 4.55pm, then get an acquittal by text while snorting cocaine off the judge's wife's tits.""

K felt an urgent need to get out of that place as fast as he could but, at the same time, the fire flowing from her eyes was more powerful than he'd ever seen it before, pulling him towards a destiny as nervously enticing as it was dangerous. Without either of them seeming to move at all, she was suddenly close enough to tickle-breath-whisper - ""All that, and more, could be yours. Are you with me, Joe?"" She stepped back, waiting for him to answer a question that could determine the rest of his life.

""Let's just get one thing clear,"" he said, unable to resist the urge to play with fire. He checked they were still alone, before continuing. ""You've been injecting Ohm with something you're stealing from this hospital... you're killing him.""

""You're joking, right? you think I'm..."" She started laughing at him. ""You've got quite the imagination there, Joe, it must be all those books you keep reading."" Noticing how serious he was, she stopped laughing and looked him squarely in the eye. ""I'm not a monster.""

""Then what the fuck was all that evil shit about? And why are you sneaking around a hospital in a nurses uniform?""

""Well, I'm no angel, either. I may be waiting for him die but I'm not killing him - nature's doing that. As for this,"" she said, stepping back and striking a pose. ""Don't I look cute?""

""...""

""Notice anything?""

""...""

""The hemline? the stockings? the heels? - this isn't exactly standard issue, we're not in a cheap 1970's sex comedy. I'm wearing this because it makes the old pervert happy, and the happier he is the more generous and absent-minded he gets about what exactly he's paying me for all the shit I'm doing for him. I'm taking him for everything I can, while I can, but I'm also working my tiny tits off to get where I want to be. It's called survival of the fittest, Joe.""

""Then what are you doing here?""

""I'm here to give a client some very good news. Come with me, if you don't believe me.""

Veronica knocked on the door and put her head in the room, while K waited off to the side, beginning to suspect that his freshly hatched instincts were way off the mark, as he listened to a brief conversation that would prove to be even more revealing than that. ""Sorry, I didn't realise you already had a visitor.""

""Hello, nurse.""

""She's not a nurse, she's my lawyer.""

""You girls take your time, I'll wait out here,"" said Veronica, closing the door and guiding K over to the window. ""You heard that, right?"" What he'd heard not only confirmed Veronica's story but also instilled an instant physical need to get his bearings that she misinterpreted as a desperate search for an exit. ""Oh, come on Joe, you don't still think...""

""That's Katie in there visiting your client,"" he said.

""Who's Katie?""

""A friend who needed my moral support today. That's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?""

""It is. Especially since I wouldn't be here without you, either - it was Womble who gave us the tip and you who tipped us off about Womble.""

""I didn't tip you off, you used me, like you probably used Womble, and like you'll probably use her... *her*?... that's not the girl who was beaten up by Hogarth Stone, is it?""

""You know about that?"" There it was. Out of nowhere, the Titorelli Close story had been verified by a fake nurse in a real hospital. Womble was telling the truth, so he couldn't possibly have a personal vendetta against K, whose instincts had proven to be correct on at least one occasion - good old Bungo. On his list of potential threats, there was at least one name he could cross off, while another was being underlined at least twice - Veronica was fuming. In fact, she was more angry with him now than when he'd accused her of being a murderer. Or was she? Could this just be an act? Why was K at the centre of all this? Was he really in control of his actions? Was someone, or something, manipulating him for some unknown reason? Was it Them? Was it The Castle? Was he just a pawn in Their game?... Why?... ""How?"" said Veronica. ""Womble?... That fat bastard's not meant to be blabbering about this, it's not good for either of their cases... does *she* know about this?""

""Katie? I didn't even know Womble's story was true until you just confirmed it. Unless her friend is telling her otherwise, Katie still thinks it was a car accident.""

""She's not telling her anything. Whores know when to keep their mouths shut, as much as when not to - unlike dumb cops... So, you haven't told anyone?"" Only a lying, manipulative journalist, he could have said.

""No,"" he said, resisting the urge to elaborate and give his own lie away.

""Good. Let's just keep it that way, yeah?""

""It'll all come out eventually though, won't it? At the trial, I mean.""

""There's not going to be a trial.""

""But I thought you said you had some good news for her.""

""The best news there is. You've seen what a great negotiator I am, right? Well, I've just secured her a six-figure settlement - she's going to be rich. I've got the non-disclosure agreement with me now, and once that's signed she can concentrate on making a full recovery. It'll all be over by Christmas.""

""Sounds like it already is for him, and he should be in prison for what he did to her. I can't believe that rich pigs like that can still get away with this sort of shit, I thought society was meant to be getting fairer.""

""It is. In the past, a girl like that would be just another anonymous victim, now she's an anonymous victim with a nice new house.""

""But what if he does it again, to some other poor girl?""

""Then I hope I get to her first.""

""I'm sure you will. Survival of the fittest, right?""

""It might sound ruthless, but it's true, even if mostly misinterpreted. The fittest isn't always the strongest or the fastest or the smartest, or even the most ruthless - you've got to know your environment, you've got to play to the crowd. If your case has taught you anything by now, it should be that sometimes the best fit is the best at being weak.""

""You two know each other?"" said Katie, surprised to find them both in a such an intimate and intense discussion.

""Small world,"" said K, suddenly feeling very light-headed, as if desperately in need of some oxygen. If he was going to feint now, at least he was in the right place. ""Veronica works for the same firm that represents me. I've been trying to get an update on my case.""

""And I've been reminding Joe of the importance of making an appointment. If you'll excuse me."" Passing by, Katie gave her a suspicious look, possibly born of a protective instinct that caught her unawares, and quickly retreated behind a fake smile.

""I hope you've got some good news for her.""

""Confidentiality aside, I think you'd be surprised how much compensation you can get for a car accident these days. Nice to meet you,"" lied Veronica.

""You too,"" lied Katie. The lawyer disappeared into her client's hospital room. ""Why is she dressed like that?""

""Halloween?... Come on, let's get some fresh air."" She took his arm and they made their way to the elevator. ""How's your friend doing?""

""Not too bad, she's getting out next week, but it was touch and go for a bit - she was in a coma for a week and still can't remember anything about the accident.""

""And how's she feeling?""

""Like shit, but you would be, wouldn't you? She did cheer up a bit when I told her I'd dumped Broker.""

""She knows Broker?""

""It was his fault we fell out... well, my fault, really. I heard them secretly planning something and got jealous, thought they were fucking, as if me and him was ever a big deal. I get like that sometimes, I know it's silly but I can't help it, you know... babes, are you even listening to me?"" After all the paranoid thoughts he'd been having lately, and the wild accusation he'd just thrown at Veronica, K might have second-guessed where his thoughts were taking him now, but that newly developed instinctive sense was keen to prove its fitness in a hostile environment.

""I'm listening. Did you ever find out what they were planning?""

""Oh, just the usual shit, but this guy wouldn't come to the club 'cause he was too bloody famous - she had to meet him in this flat Broker's got on Titorelli Close. He knew not to ask me 'cause I've never... not that I've got any moral objection, mind, it's just not for me. So, there was absolutely nothing to be jealous about and I was just being a complete bitch, which is why I had to come here and... seriously, babes, are you OK? you've gone awfully pale.""

""Do you mind if we take the stairs?""

""Of course not, we've all got our phobias, haven't we? I guess we'd all be in therapy if the idea didn't scare the shit out of us.""

On the drive back, K paid as much attention as possible to Katie's comments on Robbie's considerable writing skills, Samantha Morton's adaptable acting skills and that ""bloody nob-head""'s abominable driving skills, while his mind swam out of the choppy waters of idle speculation and clung to the rock of deductive reasoning. He desperately tried to piece together all the information he knew in a way that would make everything he was uncertain of fall illuminatingly into place, but it stubbornly refused to do so, either because one of the pieces didn't fit, or because he didn't want it to. What was he really afraid of? If only for his own mental well-being, it soon became a matter of urgency to visit the one person he'd vowed never to see again. ""Is there any chance you can you drop me off at Broker's house? There's a few things I need to clear up.""

""Why? I thought you'd be as done with him as I am.""

""I am... that's what I need to clear up... before he gets any more crazy ideas.""

""Crazy ideas like what?"" Like sadistic sex games that get out of hand and develop into extreme acts of brutality that leave a poor girl in a coma fighting for her life? ""Go on, you can tell me, I've told you all *my* embarrassing secrets involving him."" He might have allowed himself to think it, but there was no way he could reveal these suspicions to Katie. What *could* he tell Katie?

""Didn't you see my picture in paper?"" Having little interest in local politics, she'd completely missed his meteoric rise to local celebrity status but, when she parked the car a blind corner away from Broker's house, she insisted on searching for the article on *The Afterglow*'s website while he went inside. ""You don't have to wait for me,"" said K. ""I don't mind getting the bus from here.""

""It's alright, I owe you one for today and there's still a couple of hours before I have to pick Robbie up from school. Maybe we can go for a coffee, if you hurry up."" To protest would have looked too suspicious, he was just glad she hadn't insisted on coming in with him.",1,1741287965.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1j536sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1j536sd/joe_k_part_17/,Joe K - Part 17,"Awaking to the sound of banging coming from the living room, K instinctively thought it was the police again. They must have read Goolie's article, decided the 'giant insect in a dress' had gone too far this time, and were back with their heavy boots on, determined to permanently squash him. He wished, in vain, that it was another mad dream, before realising the noise wasn't coming from inside his flat, it was someone knocking the door. He slipped into a dressing gown and got up to answer it, remembering at the last minute to put the chain on - a habit he had only recently acquired.

""Hey Joe, I've brought croissants,"" said Katie, in tight blue jeans and a Pixies t-shirt. She had her hair tied up, revealing the pale, Renaissance neck that drove him crazy. ""Oh, sorry babes, I thought you were an early riser.""

""What time *is* it?"" he said, letting her in and closing the door behind them.

""Nine-ish.""

""Wow... I might have slept well.""

""Well enough to be my knight in shining armour?""

""Will a pawn in a dressing gown do?"" She embraced him with such a squeeze that she discovered an unmistakable presence between them.

""Oh... I guess you are an early riser,"" she giggled, backing away.

""Shit, I'm sorry... it must be those pills... maybe."" He was desperately searching for any excuse and struggling to regain some composure, which only increased her amusement at his red-faced attempts to conceal any trace of the uninvited guest. Eventually, she took pity on him.

""I'll put the kettle on, you go and get dressed and... whatever else you need to do.""

Ten minutes later, K emerged from his bedroom, fully clothed and acceptably flaccid, if not completely recovered from his embarrassment, and adopting an overly formal tone that threatened to send Katie into another fit of giggles. ""Please forgive me, Katie. I promise it was just an instinctive, biological, semi-conscious... event I had no control over and I have no... intention of jeopardising our relationship with any overambitious, overamorous... overadventurous, overaroused, overadjectived... attempt to... cross the friend zone border and... are you stiffling a laugh? - I mean, are you...?"" That tipped her over the edge and all attempts to control her natural impulse deserted her - she burst into hysterics.

""I'm sorry, babes, but 'cross the friend zone border' - that was too much. I mean, it was all too much but that was too too much. Where did *you* even come across that terminology? Do me a favour and erase it from your lexicography, it could do with clear out, and that's such a terrible saying *and* a complete load of bollocks, there's no such thing as the friend zone - and if there was, it would just be the week between menstruation and ovulation, between the 'get the fuck away from me' zone and the 'won't take no for an answer' zone. Now, it's really not a big deal, so will you just bloody forget about it and stop saying you're sorry 'cause it's all we seem to be doing to each other lately.""

Over coffee and croissants, Katie explained that she'd just found out that one of her friends had been involved in a car accident and was in hospital recovering. She wanted to visit her before lunch, but needed K's support to help her cope with her nosocomephobia. ""The first time I went to see my mum, I feinted the minute the hospital air hit me, and, ever since then, I've avoided them as much as I can. I even insisted on a home birth... I can't even watch any medical stuff on the telly, which seems to be half of everything that's on the bloody telly.""

""If you're not really comfortable with this, I'm sure your friend will understand.""

""I'm not. We had a bit of a fight the last time I saw her and I don't want her to think I'm avoiding her. You don't mind coming along, do you? You don't have to come into the room, just get me that far."" K took a couple of leaping pills and leapt at the opportunity to display a small amount of chivalry, stopping short of re-donning Katie's colander in a new guise of knight-errant.

Whether his presence made any difference or not, she made it to her friend's bedside without any obvious discomfort. It was K who had a bit of a wobble in the elevator, and again when Katie, possibly to mitigate the chance of there being a scene, changed her mind and insisted on introducing him. Luckily, the patient, though badly bruised and with her arm in a sling, seemed pretty doped up and pleased to see her friend. Whatever bitterness she may have felt towards Katie had obviously been obliterated by the accident. K remembered to dispense with the expected comment of wishing they'd met under better circumstances and politely left them to it.

Waiting in the corridor, he spotted a nurse coming out of the elevator who looked more familiar than she ever had before. Could Veronica be wearing that uniform so she can steal drugs from the hospital to kill Ohm with? Keeping a safe distance, he followed her to a reception desk, where she stopped to ask what? for the key to the pharmacy? He considered walking straight up to them and alerting the receptionist, but wasn't sure if impersonating a nurse was even an offence. He had to catch her in the act of stealing the drugs, then he could raise the alarm before she got off the premises. While formulating this plan, he failed to notice that she was heading back down the corridor, directly towards him. If this was a comedy, there would be a trolley nearby with a sheet on it he could patiently hide under until she obliviously passed by, but all he could do was pretend to study a poster on the wall advising him to check his boobs. K realised he hadn't completely lost his invisibility superpower when she walked straight past him. He continued his surveillance, certain he was on to something when he spotted an overhead sign that included the word *Pharmacy* and an arrow pointing to the corridor she'd just turned into. Peeping around the corner, he saw her about twenty metres ahead of him, but he would have to be careful, there was very little activity to disguise his presence. He figured she would be vigilant, or paranoid, enough to look behind her at any moment, so he tried to partially eclipse himself behind a moon-shaped woman who'd stopped spying out the window and was helpfully heading towards him. Unfortunately, his own suspicious behaviour had attracted the woman's attention and she was looking straight at him. Then she was pointing straight at him, and K was expecting her to accuse him of being some kind of weird hospital pervert, when, instead, she said - ""I don't remember your name, but I remember your face from *The Afterglow*.""

The fittest isn't always the strongest or the fastest or the smartest, or even the most ruthless - you've got to know your environment, you've got to play to the crowd. If your case has taught you anything by now, it should be that sometimes the best fit is the best at being weak.""

""You two know each other?"" said Katie, surprised to find them both in a such an intimate and intense discussion.

""Small world,"" said K, suddenly feeling very light-headed, as if desperately in need of some oxygen. If he was going to feint now, at least he was in the right place. ""Veronica works for the same firm that represents me. I've been trying to get an update on my case.""

""And I've been reminding Joe of the importance of making an appointment. If you'll excuse me."" Passing by, Katie gave her a suspicious look, possibly born of a protective instinct that caught her unawares, and quickly retreated behind a fake smile.

""I hope you've got some good news for her.""

""Confidentiality aside, I think you'd be surprised how much compensation you can get for a car accident these days. Nice to meet you,"" lied Veronica.

""You too,"" lied Katie. The lawyer disappeared into her client's hospital room. ""Why is she dressed like that?""

""Halloween?... Come on, let's get some fresh air."" She took his arm and they made their way to the elevator. ""How's your friend doing?""

""Not too bad, she's getting out next week, but it was touch and go for a bit - she was in a coma for a week and still can't remember anything about the accident.""

""And how's she feeling?""

""Like shit, but you would be, wouldn't you? She did cheer up a bit when I told her I'd dumped Broker.""

""She knows Broker?""

""It was his fault we fell out... well, my fault, really. I heard them secretly planning something and got jealous, thought they were fucking, as if me and him was ever a big deal. I get like that sometimes, I know it's silly but I can't help it, you know... babes, are you even listening to me?"" After all the paranoid thoughts he'd been having lately, and the wild accusation he'd just thrown at Veronica, K might have second-guessed where his thoughts were taking him now, but that newly developed instinctive sense was keen to prove its fitness in a hostile environment.

""I'm listening. Did you ever find out what they were planning?""

""Oh, just the usual shit, but this guy wouldn't come to the club 'cause he was too bloody famous - she had to meet him in this flat Broker's got on Titorelli Close. He knew not to ask me 'cause I've never... not that I've got any moral objection, mind, it's just not for me. So, there was absolutely nothing to be jealous about and I was just being a complete bitch, which is why I had to come here and... seriously, babes, are you OK? you've gone awfully pale.""

""Do you mind if we take the stairs?""

""Of course not, we've all got our phobias, haven't we? I guess we'd all be in therapy if the idea didn't scare the shit out of us.""

On the drive back, K paid as much attention as possible to Katie's comments on Robbie's considerable writing skills, Samantha Morton's adaptable acting skills and that ""bloody nob-head""'s abominable driving skills, while his mind swam out of the choppy waters of idle speculation and clung to the rock of deductive reasoning. He desperately tried to piece together all the information he knew in a way that would make everything he was uncertain of fall illuminatingly into place, but it stubbornly refused to do so, either because one of the pieces didn't fit, or because he didn't want it to. What was he really afraid of? If only for his own mental well-being, it soon became a matter of urgency to visit the one person he'd vowed never to see again. ""Is there any chance you can you drop me off at Broker's house? There's a few things I need to clear up.""

""Why? I thought you'd be as done with him as I am.""

""I am... that's what I need to clear up... before he gets any more crazy ideas.""

""Crazy ideas like what?"" Like sadistic sex games that get out of hand and develop into extreme acts of brutality that leave a poor girl in a coma fighting for her life? ""Go on, you can tell me, I've told you all *my* embarrassing secrets involving him."" He might have allowed himself to think it, but there was no way he could reveal these suspicions to Katie. What *could* he tell Katie?

""Didn't you see my picture in paper?"" Having little interest in local politics, she'd completely missed his meteoric rise to local celebrity status but, when she parked the car a blind corner away from Broker's house, she insisted on searching for the article on *The Afterglow*'s website while he went inside. ""You don't have to wait for me,"" said K. ""I don't mind getting the bus from here.""

""It's alright, I owe you one for today and there's still a couple of hours before I have to pick Robbie up from school. Maybe we can go for a coffee, if you hurry up."" To protest would have looked too suspicious, he was just glad she hadn't insisted on coming in with him.",1,1741287803.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

TLDR: more categories to our [Trending Deals](https://www.koupon.ai/trending?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post)  
Last year, we released a ""Trending Deals"" section where our team manually combs through thousands of offers to highlight only the legitimately good ones each day.  
Basically, we wanted to solve that problem where you waste 20 minutes scrolling through garbage deals to find the one actually worth your time.

That feature took off (turns out people don't enjoy wading through endless fake ""deals""), so we've expanded it with dedicated categories:  
\- Amazon Best Sellers - The actually decent Amazon deals, not the inflated MSRP discount BS  
\- Electronics - Tech that's actually worth buying when discounted \* Home Finds - Furniture and decor that won't fall apart in 3 months  
\- Kitchen & Dining - From air fryers to coffee gear  
\- Women's Fashion  
\- Household Supplies  
\- Kids & Baby categories

Everything is still hand-picked by our editors (real humans, not algorithms pushing sponsored garbage). We're not perfect, but we genuinely try to only list deals we'd tell our friends about. If you're tired of clickbait ""deals"" that aren't actually deals, give it a try.

1j535qu,https://i.redd.it/is8ukp2ga4ne1.jpeg,How Honey Processing Changes Both the Look and the Flavor of Coffee,"
Check out this photo! From top to bottom, you’re looking at the same Geisha coffee processed in different ways: natural, black honey, red honey, yellow honey, and white honey.

A lot of people associate honey processing with color, which makes sense because the more mucilage (that sticky pulp) you leave on the bean, the darker it looks as it ferments and dries. But it’s not just about color—the way you process a honey also changes the flavor and cup profile in a big way.

Natural: Dried with the whole cherry intact, which brings out deep fruity, wine-like flavors, and a heavier body.

Black Honey: The most mucilage left on, making it super sweet, syrupy, with molasses and intense fruit notes.

Red Honey: A little less mucilage, giving it a nice balance of acidity, sweetness, and fruity-caramel flavors.

Yellow Honey: Even less mucilage, leading to a cleaner cup, delicate sweetness, and often floral or citrusy notes.

White Honey: The closest to a washed process, meaning crisp, bright flavors with high clarity and a lighter body.


One of my favorite things about honey processing is the crazy caramel aroma the beans give off while drying. It’s insanely sweet and fills up the whole drying area. Sadly, that’s something only I get to enjoy as a producer, since by the time it reaches you, it’s already roasted. But trust me, it smells amazing.

What’s really cool is tasting the same coffee processed in different ways. It’s wild how much a small change in processing can totally transform the final cup. Some processes bring out acidity, others make it syrupy-sweet, and some make it super crisp and clean.

Even though all of these are Geisha, they’re gonna taste completely different. Coffee is such a complex and fun thing to play with! Have you ever compared different honey-processed coffees side by side?

After Target got rid of the DEI policies, there is an ongoing boycott against them. Happy to see people use their purchasing power against them.

BUT, I saw someone online say they were going to replace Target with Walmart. 

\*exhale\*

I wanted to ask everyone what is your hierarchy within these boycotts. 

I feel like it is easier to boycott something if there is easy substitute, think replacing Starbucks with any local coffee shop. Go to a local grocery store for food. 

Big Box stores a bit tricky. I buy my hygiene and self care products in bulk and for anything else I need, I try to plan ahead. 

No Amazon. Thank god I live in a shitty apartment building with no where to collect anything bigger than an envelope.  I don't buy online. My college was in a NIMBY suburb which meant anything I need would have to wait for weekends vs 48 hr ""one click online"". 

If I had to go to Walmart/Target, I would buy store brand or small business. I know this is ironic, but I it is hard seeing so many problematic companies. Of course I minimize my purchases but I imagine it would be harder if I have to search every product everytime shopping.

I imagine price is another important factor. 

Reasonable small business is my definite choice always. 

I would take any brand over Nestle.  r/FuckNestle 

No Shein or Temu. Or any fast fashion whatsoever.

I would go to Target before Walmart. eBay over Best Buy or Amazon. Food truck or family restaurant over McDonalds/Burger King etc.

Hey guys, it's your girl again! Today was a wild ride, but in a good way... I think.

So, I started the day with a cardiologist appointment. Because, you know, when you're on 40mg of Prozac, you gotta make sure your heart is still functioning properly. But hey, all good! My cardiologist gave me a thumbs up, and I didn't even have to show him my best ""I'm not crazy, I swear"" face.

After that, I spent the day with my mom. We had a full-on girls' day out, complete with hairdos, eyebrow waxing, and all the gossip. I mean, who needs therapy when you have your mom, am I right?

But the best part of the day was when my husband showed up at my mom's house with flowers. I mean, I know he's trying to butter me up, but it's working. He's like, ""Hey, I know you're crazy, but I love you anyway."" Just kidding, he didn't say that... or did he?

Anyway, we had a nice dinner, some quality chat time, and I even managed to stay awake past 9 PM. Which, let's be real, is a miracle.

So, that's my day in a nutshell. Or, rather, a Prozac capsule. How about you guys? What's new and exciting in your world?



WEEK 14, DAY 2 ON 40MG

Hey guys, it's your girl again! Today was a pretty chill day, and I'm not just saying that because I spent most of the morning lounging in bed.

I woke up bright and early at 7:40 AM, feeling like a brand new person. Okay, maybe not brand new, but at least somewhat functional. After a quick breakfast, my husband, sister, her husband, and I headed out to a soccer game.

Now, I'm not exactly what you'd call a ""sports enthusiast,"" but I had an amazing time cheering on our team with my favorite people. Plus, it was great to get out of the house and enjoy some fresh air.

On the Prozac front, I'm still adjusting to the 40mg dose, but so far, so good! I haven't noticed any major side effects, except for some occasional chest tightness. But hey, at least my heart is doing great, according to my specialist.

I'm excited to get back into my gym and yoga routine soon. Who knows, maybe I'll even discover a hidden talent for soccer.

Anyway, that's my update for today. Thanks for tuning in, guys! Don't forget to take your meds and stay hydrated.

Oh, and one more thing: if anyone needs me, I'll be the one crashed on the couch, recovering from our soccer adventure.


WEEK 14, DAY 3 ON 40MG

Hey everyone, welcome back to my daily log! I'm excited to share today's adventures with you.

I started the day feeling refreshed and calm, which was amazing. My husband and I had a relaxing morning, just chillin' around the house. We even managed to squeeze in some shopping and got some work done on our kitchen counter.

The weather was a bit chilly, but the clear sky and sunshine made up for it. We had a great time running errands and enjoying each other's company.

When we got home, we watched a movie, cleaned the kitchen, and organized our groceries. We even spent some quality time with our furry friends.

But here's the weird part: both my husband and I suddenly hit a wall of exhaustion and felt sick after our grocery run. It was like we got slammed with a truckload of fatigue!

Despite that, my energy levels were pretty good this morning, but they dipped at night. However, I did manage to stay up until 12 AM, which I think was thanks to the tiny bit of Coke I had (note to self: caffeine still affects me strongly!

As for my mental state, I'm feeling great. My mood is a solid 10/10, and my thoughts are under control. I'm even feeling more open to discussing topics that used to trigger me.

I'm really grateful for my medication, which has genuinely saved my life and changed it for the better.

Looking forward to my doctor's appointment tomorrow, where I'll be sharing my progress and discussing any medical concerns.

That's it for today, folks! Thanks for tuning in, and I'll catch you all tomorrow!


WEEK 14, DAY 4 ON 40MG

Hey, guys! It's your girl back with another epic update!

Monday vibes are going great, thanks for asking! The 40mg of magic (aka Prozac) is working its wonders, and I'm feeling pretty darn good considering my period is just around the corner.

BUT, there's a catch! I'm exhausted, and not just because I binge-watched Netflix all night (although, let's be real, that didn't help). No, no! It's because I've been coughing like a chain-smoker (which, fun fact, I used to be) between 3 AM and 6 AM. Yeah, it's been a real party.

On the bright side, I quit smoking (and vaping) a few years ago, so I'm basically a superhero. My doctor thinks it might be asthma, but I'll keep you guys posted on that.

For now, it's a beautiful, sunny Monday, and I'm rocking this whole ""cleaning the house while coughing up a lung"" thing. My hubby's gonna come home to a sparkling clean house, and I'll be over here, mainlining coffee and praying for a nap.

Side effects? Hmm... well, there's the whole chest pain thing, but I'm pretty sure that's just my lungs being like, ""Hey, girl, remember that one time you smoked a whole pack of cigs?""

All jokes aside, I'm feeling pretty good on the 40mg, and I'm excited to see how the rest of this journey goes!

That's it for today, folks! Stay tuned for more updates, and don't forget to take your meds (and a nap, if you're me).


WEEK 14, DAY 5 ON 40MG

Hey guys, welcome back to my daily log!

So today was a pretty chill day, but let me tell you, I was a zombie yesterday. I think I got like, 4 hours of sleep because I was coughing nonstop from 3 to 6 am. But last night, I slept like a baby! I went to bed at 10:30 pm and woke up at 6 am feeling like a brand new person.

I got my morning routine going - made some coffee and drinks for my hubby, got his truck ready, and took the doggies out. They're so adorable, by the way. I swear, they're the only ones who don't judge me for wearing PJs all day.

Anyway, I've been noticing that I'm falling asleep later than usual, but I'm not feeling anxious or anything. I'm just...not sleepy, I guess. And in the afternoons, I'm getting tired, which is weird for me. Maybe I'm just getting old.

On a more serious note, I'm feeling pretty good on the 40mg. I'm a bit worried about how I'll feel when my period comes in two weeks, but we'll see. I do have some premature symptoms, and next week might be a bit of a rollercoaster since it's the week before my period.

I've had some tiny intrusive thoughts, but they're easy to manage, and my hubby knows about them. My mom has them too, and I think it's more common than we think. Therapy and medication have helped me a lot!

That's pretty much my day, guys. Just doing laundry, dishes, and cooking some meat later. My hubby's coming home soon, and I'm excited to see him. See you guys soon with another daily log!

WEEK 14, DAY 6 ON 40MG (tomorrow I will be officially 1 week on 40 mg)

Hey everyone, it's me again with a new daily log!

I have to say, this journey hasn't been easy, but it hasn't been extremely hard either. Today was a bit weird, though. I woke up with some side effects that are still adjusting to my system.

For example, I'm having trouble sleeping, and when I do sleep, I wake up multiple times to pee. My anxiety is still present, but it's manageable. I also get some intrusive thoughts, but they're not overwhelming, and I can quickly shift my focus away from them.

I'd say my symptoms are around a 4 out of 10 in terms of severity. They're not extreme, just mild.

It's been almost one week since I started taking 40mg of Prozac, and I'm surprised I'm not further along. I thought I was around 3-4 weeks in, but I guess time flies!

Some other side effects I'm experiencing include tremors, which don't really bother me. I also feel a bit apathetic and empty, which is weird, especially when my husband shows me love and affection. I don't know how to respond, and it feels awkward.

Today was a pretty normal day, just going through the motions. I cleaned, did laundry, listened to music, and felt very bored at home. My husband is super supportive, though, and tells me to just relax and take it easy.

I did forget to take my Prozac on time today, but I took it a couple of hours late, and it's all good. I also took my vitamin with magnesium, which made me a bit sleepy, but I still had trouble sleeping.

That's it for today, folks! Thanks for tuning in to my daily log. See you all tomorrow!


WEEK 14, DAY 6 ON 40MG OFFICIALLY 1 WEEK COMPLETED ON 40MG

Hey everyone, it's me again! I know I said I'd be posting monthly, but I got confused and thought I was further along on my 40mg dosage. It turns out I've only just completed my first week.

I'll be posting weekly updates until I reach six weeks, and then I'll switch to monthly or possibly every three months.

So far, my symptoms haven't been too severe, likely because I started with 30mg and gradually increased to 40mg. However, over the past few days (since Tuesday), I've experienced anxiety, especially at night, along with heart palpitations.

I've also struggled with insomnia, feeling extremely sleepy but unable to fall asleep. To cope, I've been forcing myself to go to bed late, and it's been working.

Today, I've spent most of my day playing video games to distract myself from my anxiety. Watching TV hasn't been helpful, and cleaning/chores aren't an option since I've already done them this week.

I'm feeling a bit anxious without my husband here, but I realize it's not because of him. I think my cortisol levels drop around the time he comes home, triggering my anxiety. Thankfully, talking to him helps alleviate my symptoms.

Starting my second week on 40mg tomorrow, and I'm hopeful the medication will work well for me.

Today, I've been feeling down, sad, and a bit depressed. I've had some weird, anxious thoughts floating in my mind. I'm exhausted mentally and just want to stay in bed all day.

I've also been coughing a lot, which my husband and I think might be asthma. I'll discuss this with my doctor soon.

That's all for now. I'm doing my daily log early today since my husband will be coming home soon, and I want to make sure I have dinner ready.

One more thing: I've been craving brownies like crazy at night, and my husband makes amazing brownies! It might be a side effect of the medication, but I've generally been lacking appetite, only eating once a day.",1,1741287515.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

1j530lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1j530lt/earths_silent_cosmic_visitors_gravitational_waves/,Earth’s Silent Cosmic Visitors: Gravitational Waves From Black Holes,"
Imagine two black holes, each billions of times heavier than our Sun, spiraling toward each other in a cosmic dance. When they finally collide, they unleash a tsunami in spacetime —ripples called gravitational waves.These waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of the universe itself as they race outward at light speed.  

But here’s the kicker: Earth is constantly getting hit by these waves.

Since 2015, detectors like LIGO have spotted over 100 gravitational wave events. Most come from black hole mergers billions of light-years away. By the time the waves reach us, they’re weaker than a whisper—but they’re here.  

So What Happens When a Wave Passes Through You?  

1️⃣ You Get (Very, Very Slightly) Stretched and Squashed
Gravitational waves distort space itself. If a wave passes Earth, it briefly makes everything taller and thinner… then shorter and wider… like a cosmic funhouse mirror. But don’t panic:  
- The distortion is smaller than the width of a proton.  
- You’d never feel it. Your coffee mug stays put.  

2️⃣ Time Gets Wobbly (But Doesn’t Stop)
According to Einstein, spacetime isn’t just space + time—it’s a single fabric. When a wave warps space, it also warps time. Clocks *would* tick slightly faster or slower during the wave… **but by less than 0.0000000000001 seconds.** Your TikTok scroll remains uninterrupted.  

3️⃣ The Real Mindf*ck
These waves are literal echoes of chaos from the darkest parts of the universe. A merger that happened before dinosaurs existed is still sending ripples our way. If aliens felt that same wave, they’d decode the same story: two monsters colliding in the void.  

Why Should You Care?  
Gravitational waves are messages from the invisible universe. They’re proof that black holes exist, that spacetime is flexible, and that even the emptiest vacuum of space is alive with vibration.  

TL;DR:
- Gravitational waves from black holes hit Earth all the time.  
- They stretch you thinner than a proton and make time wiggle… but you’ll never notice.  
- The universe is weirder than we think  .

Please read captions for details,"This started a couple weeks ago where we noticed our dishes would get foamy after filling up with water or soups. My spit would get little suds after drinking coffee or tea.

We thought it was an issue with the dishwasher so our apartment replaced it with a new one

However, it did not seem to change anything as with the first load in the new dishwasher, the cups came out the same. We usually use detergent pods with rinse aid since we have hard water in our area. So I thought maybe the detergent was too concentrated so I ran the dishwasher without any detergent several times but the dishes still came out sudsy. 

I don’t know what else to do. I can’t even imagine the impacts on our health from ingesting so much detergent from our food

Please if anyone has seen this before, please let me know what I can do to fix this! Thanks!",0,1741287283.0,dishwashers,8,0.3,False

this year will be our 8 year anniversary. From the very beginning MIL has not liked me very much, judging by her attitude toward me. Even though she tells me she loves me and I am family, she only does this after she will blow up on me

The most recent petty spat, we went to their house Sunday because we haven't visited recently. I have some sensory processing problems where I dont like loud noise, and before I went into their house I thought ""I should probably wear my earplugs"" but I didnt
didn't

Immediately upon entering the house, the TV was on full blast and their chihuahua started howling. Within like 30 seconds of walking in I went straight to the TV remote to mute it, and she said something like, what are you doing? I said the TV is too loud, I want to turn it down. FIL turned it down cause he had the remote. (I have a great relationship with FIL)

MIL didn't say anything for a minute then she asked if my cat was still sick and I asked which one? She apparently took that as me being snappy and said ""well the sick one"" which was snappy back. I was like, we have 2 sick cats, I wasn't sure which one you were referring to. To which she said, ""the one that's almost dead""

So right then I knew she was pissed about something 

Husband tried to take the conversation elsewhere and said let's make us some coffee.

I got the smallest cup because I only ever brew 6oz with their keurig. She said, oh you will want a bigger cup. It will overflow. I said, no I will only need this small cup.

She repeated 2 or 3 times that it will overflow, you need a bigger cup. My husband also reiterated I only brew 6oz (their keurig has 6, 8, 10, 12)

I said, I haven't had any coffee today (to my husband) and she snapped, WELL YOU REALLY NEED IT!

I just said ""fuck this"" and I left to go to the car

When I walked away, FIL and husband both said no please come back

MIL began yelling NO, SHE ALWAYS COMES TO MY HOME ACTING LIKE A BITCH! THIS IS MY HOME AND SHE THINKS SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO TURN OFF MY TV!

I sat in the car about 45 minutes and she finally came to ""apologize""

First thing she says: I don't know what's wrong with you today but it made me upset

I said, I was upset the TV was so loud

She deflected blame by saying, I didn't know [FIL] turned it off. I thought you turned it off. I'm sorry I yelled, I love you.

I always say ""we love yall too"" because I never say ""I love you"" because it makes me extremely uncomfortable to say.

So after she went back in the house, all I could think was, ""you started screaming because the TV got muted and it was because you thought I did it when it was someone else. so if it had been me, you still would have gotten mad. Ok.""


.

.

.

.

Ok here comes the long rant that is unrelated (sort of?)


Like for real, there is literally no other context I can give about what lead up to this specific exchange. It happened within 5 minutes of being in the house. It is these same interactions that have happened repeatedly for almost 8 years

The time she called me a bitch for not wanting watermelon because I was in another room of the house and texted her instead of coming to tell her.
The time she wanted me to leave their house because I didn't want to pick blueberries.
The time she accused me of taking her sons money because we ""went out to dinner 7 days week"" (no we did not)
The time I went on the keto diet and started cooking low carb food for myself and she said it was because I hated her cooking.

The time she told both husband and I as well as her daughter to mind our own business because we tried to tell her to stop drinking soda when her blood sugar got too low
 I am not even joking when I say she will give herself extra insulin shots to intentionally drop her sugar so she can eat cake and fudge. When it drops to the 50s and 60s she will start chugging cokes or eat the fudge even harder.

Her new years resolution every single year is to ""take care of my diabetes, exercise, and eat protein"" and so this year I tried to help make a high protein meal plan for her and she ignored me for the entire month of January. 

8 years in, she will NOT eat my cooking. She will not eat anything i bring for holidays. She will tell me not to bring anything at all. I am not an incredible cook by any means, but I have never had a complaint from anybody else, ever. Not from any other friend, family member, or ex boyfriend. 

I had to block her on my Facebook because she had the audacity to text my husband while he was at work, accusing me of throwing a pity party and that he better nor fall for it because I posted about how ugly I felt with my loose skin after losing 100 lbs. She said I was parading around in public wearing nothing but underwear because I posted pictures of my stomach and you could see the top of my panties at the bottom of the picture. She said it was disrespectful to him that I was ""showing myself off to other men""

Body dysmorphia is what it is called. Not a pity party. And it was just the top of the band, I wasn't showing my cooch to the world. AND what is the difference if I posted myself in a bathing suit?????

Ok I got madder and madder as I wrote this post. I want to cut her off entirely but the best I can do is keep her blocked on Facebook and not visit them except for holidays and to keep my ""mask"" on extremely tightly while I am in her presence. To keep the peace and all that shit. ",3,1741287269.0,motherinlawsfromhell,3,0.8,False

* Book a **KSRTC bus** from their app or website. **Avoid** shady private operators—KSRTC is safe, well-maintained, and offers multiple bus options.
* Rent a vehicle. I went with **Royal Brothers**—solid quality, convenience, and pricing. **Highly recommended.**

# 2. Where to Stay 🏡

* **Hotels, homestays, hostels—your pick.** I stayed at **The Hosteller Rainforest Coorg**—great management, best prices. (Bhai log bohot solid mile muze waha)
   * **Downside?** A bit far from Madikeri town, and the last stretch of road gets spooky after sunset. But ab apne apne par hai have guts travel free man. 

# 3. Don’t Overplan. Just Exist.

Madikeri is not about extreme adventure or high-energy activities. It’s a **slow, misty heaven.** Some people come for nature, some for a workation, some to just sleep in peace. Whatever your vibe, **Coorg will fit.**

# 4. What to Do? Ranked from ‘Chill’ to ‘Must-Visit’ 📍(Aise Day 1 Day 2 wali list nahi hai ye)

✅ **Laidback Exploring**

* **Madikeri Fort, Govt. Museum, Thimmaiah Museum** – If you’re into history.
* **Abbey Falls, Kote Abbe Falls** – Classic waterfall experience.
* **Chiklihole Reservoir** – **A hidden gem.** Located between Madikeri & Kushalnagar, **this place is stunning.** Google it—you’ll get why.

✅ **For the Foodies 🍽️**

* **Coorg Cuisine** – **NOT overhyped.** Order **pork dishes (Pork Chops), akki roti, rice balls with pandi curry (Pork Curry)**, and **tender coconut pudding (Kuch khao mat khao ye kha k aao).**
* **Veg folks** – **Bamboo curries** (seasonal). Or go for **Belli’s Kitchen’s koot curry + akki roti + ghee rice (Best combination hai yr jyada masaledar bhi nahi tha).**
* **South Madikeri Stay?** Have breakfast at **Pancharatna Restaurant (Murnad)**—their **dosa, Mangalore buns, and tea** are elite.

✅ **Must-Visit Experiences**

* **Dubare Elephant Camp** – Leave by **8 AM**. 45 min drive. Feed, play, and bathe elephants. **Bonus**: If river levels are right, **go rafting** in the Kaveri.
* **Golden Temple Monastery** – Attend the prayer session, talk to monks (unless they’re not in the mood), and try **Tibetan food** (Thukpa is great (In VEG)).
* **Nisargadhama Sanctuary** – Feed birds, watch deer, and ha or reh reh k murga pairo par Baang dega so... 🐓😂.
* **Raja’s Seat** – **Sunset views.** Reach by **6 PM**—this place gets packed quickly after 6.
* **Talakaveri Temple** – **A spiritual and cultural landmark.** Locals believe it’s sacred, and it’s said that the first batch of spices is brought here before hitting the markets.

✅ **For the Adventurous**

* **Mandalpatti Peak** – Trek or take a **paid jeep ride** to the top. Views = worth it.
* **Road Trips in Coorg** – Just ride. **The roads here are next-level scenic.**
* **Adventure Parks** – There are **multiple parks around Madikeri & Kushalnagar** with ziplining, rope courses, and more. If you’re looking for a thrill, check them out.

* **Big Cup Café** – Great coffee, and Garlic Bread plus peaceful vibe.
* **Alpha Café** – Hilltop location, **perfect evening spot.**

✅ **Shopping? Keep It Simple.**

* **Kodagu District Hopcoms** – One-stop shop for **coffee, chocolates, homemade wine, and spices.** **Read labels** before buying so you don’t get scammed.

# 5. How to Enjoy Coorg the Right Way?

* **Madikeri is NOT about extreme adventure.** It’s about **slow, peaceful travel.**
* **Roam on a bike, sit in your homestay, enjoy the mist, chill at a waterfall, watch animals, drink coffee, eat soul-satisfying food.**
* **That’s it. That’s the magic.**

If you’re coming solo, it’s **great for self-reflection.** If you’re coming with a friend, **duo travel saves money.**

Madikeri = **Misty Bliss + Pure Relaxation.** *(Season-dependent, obviously.)*

The midnight Baja is good but no real taste as they loaded it with tequila. It was an open bar and the drinks were STRONG.

Without a doubt the carne asada quesadilla will be possibly the best item they’ve ever released.

My personal favorite was the salad along with their cafe drinks. They had a mocha cold coffee, passion fruit “refresher” and a strawberry lemonade (which was more like a flavored water)

And they're all blaming me?,"My husband and I have some mutual friends. They were his friends in highschool but when he went to college, I started hanging out with them. Being friends with them was huge for me. It helped me feel not as lonely when all my friends and my husband (at the time long distance boyfriend) were 4+ hours away at college. I used to hang out with them all the time and they were like brothers to me. And now, I can't stand them.

We started drifting apart when my husband and I got married and moved 30 minutes away. We still tried hanging out with them occasionally but we both preferred to stay home. And now that we have our LO (12 mon), hanging out with them feels like a chore. None of them are married or have kids, some have long term partners. All they want to do is go out drinking at a bar or go to a concert hours away on a weekday. My husband and I rather be at home playing with our kid. 

And now they're blaming me. Saying I'm the reason my husband never sees them anymore. I have gone out of my way to make sure my husband can see his friends if he wants to. I have made sure to never guilt him if he wants to go hang out with them. We have made new friends that are also parents. My husband meets with one of his new friends every Tuesday for coffee. He goes biking and helps with house renovations with the husbands. I go thrift shopping and bake with the wives. We're hanging out with people, just not them. And it's not like my husband has ever used me as an excuse to not hang out with his old friends. He will use any other excuse to avoid making me seem like the bad guy, even just telling them he doesn't feel like hanging out with them. I don't know why they're blaming me!

…and they showed fucking nothing. 

I went to the sleep clinic because I snore and rarely have restorative sleep. I figured it was linked, and may help with my fibro symptoms and adhd. 

Turns out I snored throughout the night but had no apnea events, so there’s nothing they can do medically for it, and I hit 26% REM sleep which is several points above the average. 

“What can I do about my snoring?”

“Get a referral from your PCP to an ENT.”

“I have a small nose and a large neck, would losing weight help?”

“Doubtful, as your weight is in the healthy range.”

“If I’m getting enough REM sleep, why don’t I wake feeling rested?” 

“You’ll need to explore more fibromyalgia treatment options with your PCP.”

“What about my hypnic jerks?”

“Reduce your stimulant intake.”

“I take a stimulant every day in order to function at work with ADHD.”

“Idk, maybe drink less coffee.”

“I drink one cup in the morning to help me feel awake.”

“Try dropping coffee all together.”

That sleep study was fucking expensive and showed that my tired ass sleeps better than most of the people in their clinic. I’m frustrated, confused by my results, and generally just not happy I have to restart the process of figuring anything out.",6,1741286523.0,Fibromyalgia,2,1.0,False
1j52ns5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j52ns5/my_best_friend_told_my_biggest_secret/,My best friend told my biggest secret,"I (19M) am bisexual. About two years ago, I fell in love with my best friend, T (now 19M). I knew he wasn’t into men, so I tried—and succeeded—in getting over it. However, one night while I was drunk, he was taking me home, and I confessed. I told him that I had been in love with him but that I wasn’t anymore. I apologized sincerely and explained that I just felt he had a right to know.

Naturally, he was uncomfortable, but we agreed to try and maintain our friendship. Things were never quite the same, but we remained close. I made every effort to respect his boundaries and avoid making him uncomfortable. I also felt guilty, as if I had hurt him and ruined our friendship. Though he never explicitly said so, that was the impression I got. Whenever I asked, he insisted that everything was fine.

About a year and a half after that, due to circumstances beyond our control, we had to sleep in the same bed. I asked if he was okay with it or if we should switch rooms, and he said it was fine. Still, I did my best to stay on my side of the bed so he wouldn’t feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, at some point during the night, I rolled over onto his arm in my sleep. He woke me up and asked me to move. The next night, he decided to sleep in a different room, saying it was because of the bed. I thought that was an excuse, but I didn’t press him—he had every right to make that choice. Instead, he slept in a room with two of our female friends, A (19F) and K (18F).

After that, things mostly returned to normal, except I noticed that A and K became more aggressive toward T.

Fast forward to about a month ago: I was out for coffee with A, and we were discussing T. He had made an awful joke toward K, and I was defending him when A suddenly said she had to tell me something. She revealed that on the night he changed rooms, he had told them about what happened. He told them I had feelings for him, that he constantly felt uncomfortable around me, and even outed me as bisexual (I am closeted because I live in a very homophobic country). He also told them that he couldn’t wait to work abroad for the summer so he could get a break from me.

At first, I didn’t want to believe her, but she knew details only he and I had discussed, and I was sure I hadn’t told her. A said they hadn’t told me sooner because they thought I wouldn’t believe them.

I was crushed. I confronted T over the phone, but he claimed he didn’t remember anything from that night and insisted A and K were just trying to ruin our friendship.

We’re meeting for drinks in a few days to talk face-to-face and hopefully resolve things. I don’t know what to think. Everything points to him betraying me, and his excuse isn’t convincing—but I don’t want to believe it. Any advice would be welcome.",2,1741286514.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.63,False
1j52neb,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1j52neb/update_for_new_supervisor_who_didnt_know_what/,Update for new supervisor who didn't know what boundaries were.,"I actually deleted the first post not long after I made it because so many people were getting on me about not separating paragraphs. I'd like you guys to know that I have since been very aware of making sure that I do this. 

In my first post I (52f) said that the new supervisor (70f) was following me everywhere and sitting right next to me, leaning on me and breathing in my face. When I asked her to back up because I need my personal space she became upset and the next thing I knew my coffee tray holding 2 coffees and my car keys in one of the little cup holders was thrown in the trash and I believed she did it.

 I didn't want to go to HR about it because I had also applied for this position. I have been working here for over 5 years. But they wanted someone who had experience in a supervisor role and creating sops. I have never created an sop but I know the job so I'm pretty sure I could do it. So they hired her from the outside. 

Anyway I didn't want HR to think I was accusing her because I was angry about not getting the job so I didn't want to involve them. HR found out anyway and they also believed it was her because of how she was acting but we couldn't prove it and I told them it's okay I just know to keep my eyes open from here on out. 

Thankfully, she did listen to me. She stopped following me close behind like she was and she set up her laptop in another area in the office and not on top of me. She's also been very nice and friendly and so we have gotten along very well, I am happy to say. And my things have stayed out of the trash lol. 

She has only been with the company for 3 months but she is having problems with the insurance and a medication she is on so she told them that sadly she cannot stay. The company understood.

 She told them that her position should be given to me because I know a lot more than they realize. That I love my job and care about the company and she believes that I would be great at it. When they brought me into the office to tell me I was floored. So it has all turned out really well. 

I'm actually sad to see her go because since she has learned about personal space and scared of the possibility of getting caught for her little vindictiveness she has been really nice and a good co worker and supervisor. And friend. I can't believe she said all those nice things about me to help me out 🫶. Her last day is next week and I'm gonna get her a farewell cake to thank her.

Hey y'all, yesterday I walked you through the Senate Bills I'm watching that are stripping away our local control and handing developers free rein over our counties. Well, get yourself a fresh cup of coffee and get ready -because today I’m going over the bills in the lower chamber, and ya’ll…it gets worse:

The Texas House in this 89th session is piling on with 39 bills (yes - 39!) to gut our local control over ETJs and MUDs. I got some questions about yesterdays post as it only focused on the upper chamber, but let me clarify this isn’t just a Senate issue; it’s the whole Legislature targeting every small county out there to turn our open spaces into their profit zones. 

Now let me address those of you who want to blame the newcomers for this. It’s not the Californians, or people moving here from other states, this is Texans in Austin screwing Texas. I and most of the other political-refugees moved here to escape this mess. Our mayors, city councils, county judges, and commissioners are trying to fight this, but they can’t stop it alone. We have to step in, we have to help.

While Rockwall county is small, 149 square miles, other rural counties are in the same boat. We're all prime targets for developers itching to build subdivisions everywhere. They don’t care about our water shortages or packed roads, or any of the other headaches. The House isn’t going to help us manage growth; at least not while they’re flooding us with bills for real estate lobbyists. Here are the ones I'm watching, with what I see as how they’ll hit us, in all counties large or small.

House Bill 211: Overrides city zoning where population fits, bans lot sizes over 1,400 square feet, caps density at 31.1 units per acre, sets setbacks at five feet, kills parking rules, and limits open space to 30%. Cities can’t resist; developers can sue, even breaking immunity. It guts local control, forces high-density sprawl, and slams our water and roads.

House Bill 282: Streamlines MUD creation in certain counties, cuts county oversight to nearly zero, lets developers spin up utility districts fast. Small counties like us get flooded with homes; our water and roads can’t cope while they cash out.

House Bill 293: Adjusts ETJ boundaries for small cities, shrinks our reach outside limits, lets developers build just beyond our rules. Big or small, we lose the buffer that keeps growth sane; chaos creeps in.

House Bill 363: Boosts landowner rights in ETJs, kills our zoning power outside city limits, lets developers drop anything anywhere. Every county’s buffer becomes their playground; size doesn’t matter.

House Bill 447: Tweaks MUD powers like annexation rules, gives developers more control over utility districts, sidelines cities and counties. Sprawl speeds up; our infrastructure chokes under the load.  
House Bill 448: Blocks city zoning near MUDs, lets developers build whatever next to utility districts, ignores setbacks or limits. Our roads clog, water runs dry; big and small towns take the hit.

House Bill 602: Eases ETJ development consent rules, stops cities from demanding a say on projects outside limits, lets developers roll over us. Counties of all sizes drown in growth they can’t stop.

House Bill 755: Simplifies MUD creation outside city limits, strips counties of control, lets developers flood rural areas with homes. Small places like Rockwall get slammed hardest; water and roads collapse.

House Bill 954: Exempts rural ETJs from city zoning, hands developers a free pass just outside small towns, wipes out our rural charm. Counties big or small lose leverage quick.

House Bill 987: Gives developers control over MUD and ETJ infrastructure, water, sewers, roads, all in their hands. After shortages, we need local solutions, not their profit-first junk; every county’s at risk.

House Bill 1749: Limits zoning changes after projects start, locks cities into old rules, stops us from fixing growth problems. Big or small, we’re stuck while developers keep going.

House Bill 1862: Freezes ETJ expansion for cities, blocks small towns from growing their buffer as people move in, leaves gaps for developers to swarm. Counties lose planning power everywhere.

House Bill 1901: Eases MUD creation in unincorporated areas, cuts county say even more, ramps up rural sprawl fast. Small counties like us see fields disappear overnight.

House Bill 1930: Curbs ETJ zoning appeals, makes it easier for developers to win fights, weakens city pushback. Big and small, our control fades while they build free.

House Bill 2015: Shields MUD property rights over local rules, puts developers first, makes our plans worthless. Every county’s voice gets drowned out for their profits.

House Bill 2024: Cuts city zoning near MUDs like 448, protects developers with no local limits, trashes our water and roads. Big or small, we’re in trouble.

House Bill 2156: Weakens ETJ zoning enforcement, stops cities from controlling chaos just outside limits, lets developers run wild. Every county’s buffer falls apart.

House Bill 2225: Messes with impact fees we charge developers, ties our hands on funding roads and water, lets them off the hook. Big and small counties pay while they profit.

House Bill 2246: Adjusts MUD governance rules, reduces local input, lets developers call more shots in utility districts. Counties watch sprawl take over helpless.

House Bill 2268: Expands ETJ exemptions for developers, shrinks our buffer, lets them build with no rules. Big or small, cities lose grip fast.

House Bill 2347: Simplifies MUD permitting, speeds up developer projects, slows our say to a crawl. Sprawl hits with no brakes; every county feels it.

House Bill 2452: Limits zoning near MUDs and ETJs, shields developers again, crushes our rules while infrastructure suffers. Big and small get hit hard.

House Bill 2471: Protects ETJ landowners from city rules, puts developer rights over local control, turns our buffers into their turf. Every county size takes the blow.

House Bill 2512: Reforms MUD financing rules, cuts oversight, lets developers fund projects cheap while we pay later. Counties big or small lose out big.

House Bill 2561: Cuts ETJ development restrictions, loosens city grip, lets developers build fast and loose. Big and small, we’re all exposed.

House Bill 2635: Tweaks ETJ land use rules, hits our buffer again, gives developers more ground to take. Counties lose planning power, every size.

House Bill 2683: Limits zoning near MUDs, ignores our plans, lets developer profits roll over roads and water. Every county’s at risk here.

House Bill 2692: Boosts MUD autonomy from local checks, cuts county control, lets developers run utility districts their way. Big or small, we lose out.

House Bill 2844: Reforms ETJ appeals process, lets developers dodge accountability, fades our leverage away. Every county size feels it.

House Bill 3097: Eases MUDs in rural counties like Rockwall, turns our fields to tract homes, slams small counties hardest. We can’t stop the flood.

House Bill 3139, 3671, 3812: Overlap on zoning and MUD tweaks, all shield developer rights over local rules, put profit first every time. Big or small, our say’s gone.

House Bill 3154: Expands MUD eminent domain powers, lets developers grab our land, leaves cities and counties helpless. No matter the size, we’re sunk.

House Bill 3184: Limits ETJ expansion, locks our buffer, lets developers swarm the gaps we can’t fill. Every county gets hit hard.

House Bill 3298: Shields MUD property rights over our rules, gives developers another win, makes our control a joke. Big and small, we’re out.

House Bill 3363: Simplifies ETJ development, cuts city say, slams sprawl on us all no matter the county size. We can’t fight back.

House Bill 3381: Cuts ETJ zoning power, opens our edges wide, lets developers ignore our limits. Big or small, they don’t care.

House Bill 3404: Blocks zoning near MUDs like 448 and 2024, trashes our infrastructure while they build free. Every county is in the crosshairs.

House Bill 3509: Overhauls MUD creation rules, strips counties bare, lets developers steamroll us with homes we can’t support. We’re toast.

Here’s a quick lump overview: 
HB 211’s a zoning killer, then 282, 755, 1901, 3097, 3509, plus 447, 2347, 2512, 3615, 3812, and 2692 juice up MUDs; our say’s gone. 

HB 293, 363, 602, 954, 1862, 2156, 2561, 3184, 3363, 3381, with 1930 and 2471, shred ETJs; buffers vanish. 

HB 448, 2024, 2452, 2635, 2683, 2844, 3404, plus 1749, block zoning; developer shields everywhere. 

HB 987, 3154, 2015, 2225, 2268, 3298, 3671, 3812, and 3139 prioritize their rights over our rules; profit rules all. 

That’s 39 bills, with all but one of them a developer win.

This House-Senate flood, 39 in the House and a dozen from the Senate, shows Texans in Austin, not newcomers, are selling us out. By the end of the session (June 2, 2025) Rockwall and other small counties could be done: subdivisions everywhere, no water, jammed roads, broke budgets. Our county and city leaders - Mayors, Councilmembers, Judges, County Commissioners – they all need our help. Track these, HB 211, 755, 1901, all 39 if you can, on Texas Legislature Online, also referred to as MyTLO. Share this information with others. Let our legislators know that small counties are fed up. 
 
I know that growth is inevitable, but I’d prefer smart growth, not this developer landslide. How about you?

1j52ebc,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingNashville/comments/1j52ebc/trip_report_22834/,Trip Report 2/28-3/4,"Wanted to provide an update and trip report to my previous post a couple weeks back asking y'all to critique my itinerary for a trip. Sorry if formatting sucks.

https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingNashville/comments/1ihx05e/please_critique_my_itinerary/?ref=share&ref_source=link

Came into town for the very first time for 3 Billy Strings concerts and ended up staying at Sentral SoBro. Great location to Broadway, Country HoF and Bridgestone Arena & Ryman. Hotel was pretty bare bones and short on amenities and places really close by, but was a pretty good value for the price. 

Here's what I ended up doing/eating:
Friday
- 6th & Peabody - Yee Haw Brewing & White Duck Taco - Cool vibe on a nice day. Beer was ok, tacos were solid. Tried them when visited Asheville and say they were on par with ones I got there. 

- Country Music HoF & Hatch Show Print tour - Hatch tour was one of highlights of trip. Wish we could go into the shop itself, but  loved learning about their process & history and being able to make my own print. 

- Martin’s BBQ - Got 4 Ribs and Potato Salad. Good, but not great. Solid Preshow meal. 

- Concert @ Bridgestone Arena - Really nice arena. Friendly staff, really easy to get in/out. Pretty cool to be dumped right onto Broadway postshow. 

Saturday 
- Parlor Donut & Latte - Almost completely sold out of donuts, besides two random Maple Bacon donuts. Got one and it was really good, plus a surprisingly really good vanilla latte. 

- Parthenon & Centennial Park - really cool spot. Definitely worth the effort getting there. 

- Red’s Hot Chicken @ Springwater - Asked at window for a rec between sandwich or Crunchwrap and guy working recommended Crunchwrap. Wish I had gone with a sandwich in hindsight as chicken was chopped pretty finely and got lost in the mix. Ordered it medium spice and it really enjoyed it, 

- Culture & Co., Honest Coffee & 5 Daughters at L&L Market - really loved the concept of Culture & Co and had some nice pairings. Spoke with really nice owners and had a great experience, but agree with most critiques I've read of it being too expensive. Great cortado at Honest Coffee and took a couple mini donuts to go from 5 Daughters. Surprisingly preferred Parlor Donut vs. 5 Daughters as these were pretty dry.

- Joyland Crustburger for late night - Got burger togo, but took a bite while it was fresh. Can honestly say it was one of the best burgers I've ever had, even cold and all congealed. 

- Concert @ Bridgestone 

- Cruise down Broadway (Tootsie’s & JBJ’s Place)  - Was a cold night and Broadway was still hoppin'. Long line to get into Robert's but got a drink at Tootsie's and then JBJ's Place (brother is a big Bon Jovi fan, so wanted to visit for him). 

Sunday
- Cortado @ Whisk Creperie in Assembly Hall - Inedible, horrible coffee. Took two sips and tossed.

- Self Guided Tour @ Ryman - Visited in prep for concert that night at Ryman. Amazing experience. Really cool, engaging video telling history and having the freedom to walk around inside was awesome! 

- “Sumo Mary” @ Sunda - Everything was really good, but had a weird service issue that soured experience. Sumo Mary as advertised is served as 32oz. Didn't want to drink that much so served offered to make a smaller 16oz version and have food served on plate rather than skewered ontop. Bill came and they charged same price, even though I got smaller drink and they said the price was the price, no matter what size drink I got.  

- Barista Parlor @ W hotel - Great latte! Took it to The Restaurant in the hotel and listened to some really good music. Really liked the seating variety and vibe of BP's space. Definitely hotel lounge-vibes, but very cool space. 

- Station Inn - Attended Gospel Sunday show. Venue was amazing. Great listening room and players were great. I love bluegrass and its connection to gospel and christianity, but really felt the song selection was a bit too ""Jesus-y"" for me. Might just be me!

- Concert @ Ryman - Bucket List experience. Amazing concert. Pews were tight and uncomfortable, but acoustics and soul of the room was just amazing. 

Monday:
- Breakfast at Monell’s - One of the highlights of trip! Such a unique experience. Really feel like the world would be a better place if there were more places like this! Tried to pull a fast one and utilize the ole buffet trick of arriving close to the changeover between breakfast/lunch to take advantage of both, but they only allowed me to experience their breakfast food. Luckily breakfast still included their amazing fried chicken, biscuits and plenty of amazing sides. Left very full and happy!

- Walk through Little Hats - Walked around Germantown and walked through Little Hats Deli. Really cool spot, wish I had a second stomach as I would have loved to eat here too, but I was just so full from Monell's. 

- Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge - pretty nice views, nice walk on a beautiful afternoon. 

- Johnny Cash Museum - Love Johnny Cash and learned a lot. Loved all the listening stations, but probably wouldn't recommend until you're a really big fan.  

- Goo Goo Clusters - Definitely a tourist trap, but was fun to build my own candy bar and see it made. Tasted just okay and it was expensive for what it was, but don't regret visiting. 

- Recession Special @ Robert’s Western World - Another highlight of the trip! Bologna sandwich was surprisingly good and music/ambiance was great. Nice departure from all the celebrity owned honky tonks and cover bands!

- Song Suffragettes @ The Listening Room - Really great experience. Loved the Listening Room and thought most of the performers were great! Got a solid Old Fashioned that covered the $16 food/drink minimum. 

- Dinner @ Husk - Ate in bar, not the nicest spot in the restaurant but food was great! Got Beef Tartare, Pig Ear Lettuce Wraps and a coffee granita dessert that were all really good!

Tuesday 
- Latte @ Crema - Really good latte. A bit overhyped IMHO. Felt lattes from Parlor Donuts and Barista Parlor were better. 

- Pulled Pork Taco & Red Headed Stranger - ended up having a few extra hours to kill before my flight out and decided to check out another neighborhood and RHS came highly recommended. Got out of my Uber and was surprised to find Audrey right next door. I had really wanted to go to Audrey the night before, but ended up going to Husk because it's proximity to the Listening Room. Audrey wasn't open yet, so got Pulled Pork Taco and a Hibiscus Aqua Fresca and was really impressed. Wish I had that second stomach again... 

- Lunch @ Audrey - Great meal. Got Johnny Cakes with Pimento and Aged Country Ham. Food was great. Loved the vibe of the restaurant. Got a tour of the upstairs testing kitchen and cookbook library and thought that was really cool! 

- Third Man Records - Had time for a quick visit on the way back to Sentral SoBro to pick up my bags and head to the airport. Not much to see, but really enjoyed the listening booth. 

- Prince’s @ Airport - Flight got delayed, so got to eat here. Got Mild tenders, not to overly spice before my flight and really loved my meal. Perfect, juicy tenders... still plenty of heat with the mild. Wish I had tenders at Reds to compare directly, but think Prince's would be hard to beat. 

Was solo for the majority of the trip, short of meeting up with friends at the concerts and Ryman tour. As a result was able to move pretty quickly and effortlessly and feel like I accomplished a lot on this trip. Saw everything I really wanted to see but am definitely hoping to return for another trip to Nashville to explore more restaurants/breweries and neighborhoods.

Visiting SF for the first time from NYC for work. I have three days (fly in on a Monday morning, fly out on a Wednesday night). Feeling a bit overwhelmed about what to do with any free time I have! I work in F&B but don't have any friends in SF, so unsure of spots to hit. Mostly looking at bakeries, restaurants, any bars worth visiting. I do love bars with amazing food and good martinis, specifically. Also any easy to access views / nature would be awesome.

I'll be staying in Japantown, and our office is in the Presidio. I most likely will be back out for a longer period of time in the near future, so if any of these seem like dumb ideas for a short trip, I'm willing to change my plans up. For instance, I have a few places in the Mission saved, and that seems a bit out of the way from Japantown.

Anyways, here are spots I have saved; curious what seem worth it, and if there are recommendations people have in place of some of these:

* La Taqueria
* The Coffee Movement
* Deli Board
* El Castillito
* Banh Mi Crunch
* Key Klub
* Lou's Cafe
* Zam Zam
* Trick Dog
* True Laurel
* Bar April Jean

1j52d6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1j52d6x/moving_to_a_walkable_city_has_been_the_biggest/,Moving to a walkable city has been the biggest factor in improving my mental health,"I grew up in the suburbs, so all my life, I just assumed car dependency was normal. But after experiencing life in a truly walkable city with solid public transit, I realized just how much driving every day had been draining me—especially as someone with ADHD and level 1 autism.

Suburban life is supposed to be ideal: friendly people, safe neighborhoods, nice houses. But for me, I can safely say that it’s my personal hell on earth.   It was isolating, overstimulating in all the wrong ways, and made my executive dysfunction way worse. I didn’t fully understand why until I took a step back and really reflected on the impacts of car dependency for me.

### 1. Executive Dysfunction & Mental Barriers

One of the biggest differences is how much easier it is to just *get out of the house*. In the suburbs, every errand or social event required getting in a car, dealing with traffic, and finding parking. Even if I wanted to go somewhere, the mental effort of starting that process was often enough to keep me stuck at home.

Now, I can just grab my keys, step outside, and start walking. No prep, no planning—just movement. It lets me leverage my impulsivity to beat executive dysfunction.  That single change alone has drastically reduced my tendency to rot in my bed and fall into depression, which always happens when I visit family in the suburbs for more than 1 week.

### 2. Driving is Overstimulating & Exhausting

I can drive just fine, but it wears me down. The flashing lights, unpredictable drivers, sudden stops, honking, and constant need for hyper-focus leave me mentally drained before I even get where I’m going. My brain already struggles to filter out distractions because of ADHD, and the sensory overload from driving (especially in traffic) is exhausting with autism.

With public transit, I don’t have to be on the entire time—I can just sit, put on headphones, read a book, or look out the window. Even walking to my destination is a much calmer experience than dealing with the chaos of driving.

### 3. Walking as a Mode of Transit is Stimulating in the Right Way

Driving numbs you to your surroundings. When I lived in the suburbs, I’d go straight from Point A to Point B without noticing anything in between because I’m in my car bubble and focused on the road. But in a walkable city, the journey itself is interesting.

Every time I go out, I come across something new—a cool coffee shop I haven’t tried, a piece of street art, a live event in a public square, or a hole-in-the-wall bookstore. There’s a sense of discovery and novelty, which is amazing for an ADHD brain. Instead of being stuck in a repetitive cycle, my environment naturally provides new stimuli that are engaging but not overwhelming.

### 4. Built-in Movement Helps My Brain Function

ADHD makes it hard to regulate dopamine, and one of the best ways to balance that is physical movement. When I lived in a car-dependent area, I barely walked anywhere because there was nowhere to walk—everything was too spread out. If I wanted exercise, I had to specifically set aside time for it, and let’s be real, that almost never happened.

Now, walking is just part of my daily routine. Whether I’m commuting, running errands, or meeting up with a friend, I’m naturally moving throughout the day, which helps keep my brain regulated and my energy balanced.  I’ve also gotten more fit as the gym is way more accessible as is running in safe, distraction-free, car-free spaces nearby to where I live.

### 5. Less Decision Fatigue & Mental Drain

Living in the suburbs means constantly making micro-decisions about driving:
	•	What’s the best route?
	•	Is there traffic?
	•	Do I have gas?
	•	Where will I park?
	•	Do I risk making this left turn?

For a brain that already struggles with executive function, those small decisions add up and drain me before I even get where I need to be. In a walkable city, there’s almost no planning involved—I just go. The reduced mental load makes everyday life so much easier.

### 6. (Good) Public Transit is a Break, Not a Burden

I get why some people hate public transit, but for me, it’s way less stressful than driving. I can zone out, read, listen to music, or just sit quietly instead of spending all my energy reacting to other drivers. Even if it takes a little longer, it doesn’t feel as exhausting.  I can even be productive if I bring a book or listen to a podcast or do some other errands on my phone if I need to.

### 7. Walkability Reduces Isolation & Increases Social Connection

Suburbs are isolating. If you want to see people, you have to plan it. There’s no casual social interaction—everyone is sealed off in their cars or inside their houses.

In a walkable city, social connection happens naturally. I see familiar faces at my local coffee shop, chat with neighbors, or stumble into street events I wouldn’t have even known about otherwise. It’s a low-pressure way to feel part of a community without the effort of organizing plans every time I want to interact with another human being.

### 8. True Freedom is Having Options

People always say that cars equal freedom, but to me, they feel like a requirement, not a choice. If you live in a car-dependent area, you have to drive—it’s not optional. That’s not freedom, that’s just a system that forces everyone to participate whether it works for them or not.


Since moving to a walkable city, I feel lighter—less stressed, more engaged, and way more in control of my life. If you’ve never experienced what it’s like to live somewhere truly walkable, I highly recommend trying it. You might not realize how much car dependency is draining you until you’re free from it.",33,1741285801.0,AutisticWithADHD,6,0.98,False

So I had weened myself off of caffeine and was drinking only decaf for over a year.  Then slowly but surely half a cup at a time starting drinking more regular coffee. Lately 3-4 a day.  I was feeling a little more anxious which I hadn’t really been feeling in years but in the past have had problems with anxiety and panic attacks.  This morning I wasn’t hungry so I didn’t eat before taking off on a 3.5 hour drive but I did drink two coffees.  All of a sudden while driving I had a panic attack for the first time in probably 3-4 years.  Was doing all types of breathing exercises, foot was shaking, so I put my car on cruise control and rode it out.  Has anyone had a similar thing happpen?

Hiya!

I am a married woman with no kids looking to make some friends that live in Europe (particularly France, Germany, or the Netherlands). I have been learning French and Dutch, enough to almost easily read a book in French and understand some basic Dutch. I'd like to get fluent in both, and then move on to other languages, but am currently focusing on Dutch while I have no French bilingual friends.

I apparently am a pretty unique individual when it comes to my personal beliefs, and therefore would not be compatible friends with half or most Americans. I have several American friends, but all of them live nowhere near local to me. Of my 2 besties I've had since childhood, one is American and one is from another country. I have a degree, am physically fit, and work a job with an occasional modeling gig on the side.

I have an xbox that I play on and an iPhone/Whatsapp. I do NOT have snapchat \[at all\] or use discord. (I think people were reading this backwards?? Me no have. No snappy. No discord...)

If you live in a European country, hit me up and let me know what country you live in! Also ask me 1-3 questions in your first message if you'd like. And let me know if you'd like me to ask you 1-3 questions in turn! Thanks if you read my whole post, even if you don't DM/comment.

1j5250y,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackholes/comments/1j5250y/what_happens_when_a_black_holes_gravitational/,🌌 What Happens When a Black Hole's Gravitational Wave Slaps Earth?,"
Imagine two black holes, each billions of times heavier than our Sun, spiraling toward each other in a cosmic dance. When they finally collide, they unleash a tsunami in spacetime —ripples called *gravitational waves*. These waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of the universe itself as they race outward at light speed.  

But here’s the kicker: Earth is constantly getting hit by these waves.

Since 2015, detectors like LIGO have spotted over 100 gravitational wave events. Most come from black hole mergers billions of light-years away. By the time the waves reach us, they’re weaker than a whisper—but they’re here.  

So What Happens When a Wave Passes Through You?  
1️⃣ You Get (Very, Very Slightly) Stretched and Squashed
Gravitational waves distort space itself. If a wave passes Earth, it briefly makes everything taller and thinner… then shorter and wider… like a cosmic funhouse mirror. But don’t panic:  
- The distortion is smaller than the width of a proton.
- You’d never feel it. Your coffee mug stays put.  

2️⃣ Time Gets Wobbly (But Doesn’t Stop)  
According to Einstein, spacetime isn’t just space + time—it’s a single fabric. When a wave warps space, it also warps time. Clocks would tick slightly faster or slower during the wave… but by less than 0.0000000000001 seconds. Your TikTok scroll remains uninterrupted.  

3️⃣ The Real Mindf*ck
These waves are literal echoes of chaos from the darkest parts of the universe. A merger that happened before dinosaurs existed is still sending ripples our way. If aliens felt that same wave, they’d decode the same story: two monsters colliding in the void.  

Why Should You Care?  
Gravitational waves are messages from the invisible universe. They’re proof that black holes exist, that spacetime is flexible, and that even the emptiest vacuum of space is alive with vibration.  

TL;DR:
- Gravitational waves from black holes hit Earth all the time.  
- They stretch you thinner than a proton and make time wiggle… but you’ll never notice.  
- The universe is weirder than we think.

-----------------------------------------------------

Fast food is not always fast. Did you know long lines make some people not buy food? The fast-food business wants to be faster. More people are using **AI in fast food** now. This is because the business is hard. **Fast-food chains** need **AI adoption** to make more money.

This writing will show why **fast-food chains** need **AI adoption**. I will talk about how **fast-food technology** helps. You will find out about making food faster. This is very important for business. You learn how to stay ahead. This writing gives you ideas. It shows the increasing need for **fast-food chains** to invest in **AI** to stay competitive.

Key AI Applications Transforming Fast-Food Operations
-----------------------------------------------------

Getting food fast is important. Now, many places use **AI order taking**. You see this at drive-thrus. It is like talking to a computer. **AI** can hear you well. It understands what you want. This makes ordering easy. It also makes it faster.

Some places use **AI** on phones too. You tell the **AI** what you want. It puts your order in. This helps workers inside. They don't have to take as many orders. This means they can make food better. Also, **AI** helps with **customer experience**.

Some **AI** programs know what you like. They suggest food for you. This is like having a helper. This all makes getting food fast and easy. This also discusses **AI**-powered order taking, including **voice assistants** at drive-thrus.

Revolutionizing Kitchen Efficiency with Automation Technologies
---------------------------------------------------------------

Making food fast needs help in the kitchen. **Robotic kitchens** are now becoming real. Machines can cook burgers. They can fry potatoes. This makes everything faster. **AI** makes sure the food is always the same. Every burger tastes just right. **Fast-food automation** helps keep things clean too.

These machines do not get tired. They work all day. This is good for the **fast-food** place. They can sell more food. Also, workers can do other jobs. They can help customers. They can make sure the store is clean. This shows how **AI**-driven **robotics** and **automation** improve food preparation speed and consistency.

Inventory Optimization and Demand Forecasting with AI
-----------------------------------------------------

Wasting food is bad for business. It makes stores lose money. **AI** can help. It knows how much food to order. It looks at what people buy. If many people want burgers, it orders more. If not many people want fries, it orders less.

This helps keep the **fast-food** place from wasting food. Also, **AI** can tell them when things will be busy. If there is a football game, many people will want food. The **fast-food** place can get ready. They will have enough food and workers. This saves money and makes people happy. This also discusses how **AI** helps **fast-food** restaurants minimize waste and maximize profits.

Navigating the Pitfalls: Lessons from Early AI Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, **AI** makes mistakes. I saw on the news. Some **AI** could not hear people well. It got orders wrong. This made people angry. Also, some people do not like talking to machines. They want to talk to a person. The **fast-food** place must be careful.

**AI** needs to be right. It needs to be easy to use. If not, people will not like it. The **fast-food** place needs to train the **AI** well. Also, they need to listen to customers. They must fix problems fast. I heard that accuracy issues and **customer resistance** are big problems.

Real-World Examples: Case Studies of AI Impacting Fast-Food Chains
------------------------------------------------------------------

Some stores use **AI** to take orders. People like this. It is fast. The store makes more money. Other stores tried to use **AI** in the kitchen. But it did not work well. The machines broke. The food was not good.

I read about one store. It used **AI** to tell it what to order. It saved money. Another store tried using **AI** to make burgers. The burgers tasted bad. People did not buy them. So, some **AI** works. Some **AI** does not work. **AI** success depends on the way the popular **fast-food chains** apply the solutions.

The Future of AI in Quick Service: Trends and Predictions
---------------------------------------------------------

**AI** will get smarter. I think it will know what you want before you do. Maybe it will see your car. It will know you want a coffee. Then, it will make it for you. **AI** will also help with delivery. Drones may bring you food.

Someday, **fast-food** places may not need workers. Robots will do everything. But I think people will still be there. They will make sure the robots work right. They will help customers. This also helps in projecting emerging **AI** applications and the long-term effects on the industry.

Conclusion
----------

**Fast-food chains** use **AI** more and more. They want to be fast. They want to make you happy. They need to learn from mistakes. If they do, they can make a lot of money. They can make your food faster. They can make your food better. It's important for maximizing the return on investment in **AI technologies**.

I am looking for recommendations for coffee beans, that are not expensive. Preferably ~20 euros per kg.
Also, preferably Italian. Wife and I visited Italy 2 years back, and absolutely loved the coffee there.. Since then we have been trying beans from Italian makers.",0,1741284828.0,berlinsocialclub,5,0.5,False

She says shady things and then completely denies it when confronted. Ex) Crystal told Sutton that Dorit said that she thinks she could put alcohol in her coffee, and Dorit denies it. Girl it is on camera. Every time she is confronted, she twists it. I think she genuinely forgets what she says too. Delusional in the way that she thinks she is perfect. 

Besides not owning up to what she says, she makes everything about her and how she feels. Ex) When Garcelle told the group that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about her children around them. Dorit gets soooo offended and makes it about her feelings instead of considering why Garcelle might feel that way. 

I could give endless examples. She annoys the absolute piss out of me and I can't help it. ",15,1741284806.0,RHOBH,7,0.83,False

Now obviously most Americans simply don't drink tea, but the ones who do use a hob kettle, which most Americans would call a stovetop kettle.  Are these uncommon in the UK?  I ask this only because many of you seem to assume that without electric kettles, Americans must microwave water to brew tea or herbal teas, which I've  honestly never known anyone to do.  Like most Americans I prefer coffee, and so my kitchen has a coffeemaker and an espresso machine, but I like an occasional cup of chamomile in the evening, and for that I use the hob kettle.  With hot tap water and a gas stove, it's boiling in two minutes or so.",0,1741284764.0,AskBrits,50,0.44,False
