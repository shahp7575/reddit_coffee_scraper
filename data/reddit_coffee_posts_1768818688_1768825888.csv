There are no lovely old windmills, no cannabis-filled coffee shops and on a recent visit it was far too early for tulip season.

“When foreigners end up there, it is for one reason: to claim asylum at the Netherlands’ biggest refugee camp, home to 2,000 desperate people from all around the world.

“Some, like the Eritreans and Somalis, are fleeing war; the Syrians insist it remains unsafe for them to return home after the fall of Assad.

“But in the last year they have been joined by a curious new cohort: a bunch of Americans, who say they have feared for their lives ever since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

“Their presence has surprised many of the camp’s residents. ‘My dream is to go to America or the UK. America for me is the paradise,’ said Usama, a 21-year-old Libyan-Algerian hanging around the main gate. ‘You can work, you can make a million if you have a good idea. Why they come here?’

“It is a fair question. Last year, 76 Americans claimed asylum in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch asylum and immigration ministry, up from nine in 2024. Unlike the UK, the Netherlands does not rent out hotels or houses for asylum seekers, instead housing them in fenced-off camps, officially called reception centres, dotted around the country.

“Many of the American refugees, like Jane-Michelle Arc, a 47-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, are transgender. In April last year she flew into Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and, sobbing, asked a customs officer how to claim asylum. ‘And they laughed because: what’s this big dumb American doing here asking about asylum? And then they realised I was serious.’”",1,1768825769.0,transgender,0,1.0,False

I am searching for ground coffee in the north nazmibad area. I have already tried imtiaz, and kafiyah but could not find any. Does anyone know where I could find some ground coffee in the area? I have a French press but I am out of coffee :/

I even tried asking some of the cafes such as drop coffee and Melbrew but they didn't have any for sale. 

Just to clarify I am not looking for instant coffee.",1,1768825732.0,karachi,0,1.0,False
1qh2v1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartEvolution/comments/1qh2v1w/what_is_wholeness/,What is wholeness?,"Imagine a bicycle is wholeness. When you see a bicycle, you see it as a whole with its parts that make it up - tires, frame, pedals, brakes, seat, handlebars, chain, gears.

But where's the bicycle in all of this? Is the tire a bicycle? Is the chain a bicycle? Is the frame a bicycle?

What if I take apart the tires and brakes and frame from the bicycle..will it still be a cycle? 

So that means all parts are one with the cycle, right? But there's no thing as ""cycle"" itself - we call something a cycle when all the parts are arranged in a way that looks like a cycle.

And also, there's no cycle without a rider and the road too. The rider and the road are also part of the cycle.

Now let's look at the beautiful arrangement of what you call yourself.

The air you breathe in and out is part of you. The air you've been breathing has been in and out of countless beings on the planet.

Your blood running in your veins is water and is part of you. It has been part of rivers, clouds, someone's tears.

The food you eat like an apple  becomes part of your skin and cells. And that apple has been part of the tree. So you're one with the tree now.

The thoughts in your mind - the basic building blocks of language that make up words like tree, sky, bird, tomato - are the same thoughts everyone thinks. It's just that they arrange them differently in sentences and it becomes a different meaning and story.

Someone a thousand miles away is thinking ""I need to make coffee now,"" and you've also thought that at some point, or will later in the day. Like, we all think the same words, just in different configurations at different points.

The sun in the sky touching your skin - you're part of the sun. You know sometimes you stay in the sun for too long and it starts to burn your skin? That sun heat is now in you. ☀️

Like, you're not separate from anything.

If you want to see wholeness in parts, the most obvious clue is twins. They look the same. The only thing is they don't think the same thoughts. They have separate thoughts in their minds. And they're not engaging with the same universe all the time.

For example, if twin one is watching TV and twin two is riding a bike outside - different worlds, different scenes, right? 

Now imagine this scene..Two twins dressed up in the same clothes (outside wrapper is the same now). 

And they're both reading the same book, word for word simultaneously, and chewing gum at the same time (inside content - the reading words  is the same in their mind). And also the flavor of the chewing gum.

Aren't they now both the same inside and outside? Like two same TVs of the same brand with the same show playing (the book they're reading in the mind) and the same taste of gum in their mouth.

You can think of yourself in other beings too. Like you can think yourself in your dogs, cats, parrots, chickens. Like, whatever is looking through your cat's eyes is the same thing that's looking through your eyes. Like the same paper, but the writing is more complex in your mind compared to your cat's mind. 

What I'm trying to say is that without our wrappers of memories, preferences, desires, names - aren't we all the same candy made of the same chocolate. 

Like imagine you're Pepsi and I'm Coca-Cola.

Just packaging and brand is different. But we're all the same coke.

And you as Pepsi can mix into me as Coca-Cola in one glass. Then there's no Pepsi and Coca-Cola. And we say it's Coca-Cola, but it's not even Coca-Cola. It's actually water. And we say ""water"" as water, but that's a name we gave to water so we can understand we're talking about the same thing when we say water.

But nature itself doesn't have any language or names for the things we see.

So wholeness is hiding in parts. Don't see parts. See the whole.

""Wholeness is hiding in parts""

This sentence is complete and whole. But it looks like parts because there is space between words. Without space it would be like:

""Wholenessishidinginparts""

Separation isn't a bug. It's a necessary feature.

But you're not the words. You're the space in which the entire sentence - including all the words that appears. We all are the same space. But words aren't separate from the space. They might appear separate so the space can read the sentence.🙂

So you're the river as blood in your veins.

You're the tree and Earth as tomatoes and apples inside you.

You're the air as oxygen inside you.

You're the Sun as the warmth of sun rays on your skin.

You're one with everyone's mind and heart as the building blocks of language, and whatever you see and hear, feel, touch, and taste is the same as everyone.

We all are beautiful words that make up beautiful sentences that make up a beautiful story. One as a story. Separate as sentences.

But beyond the words, sentences, and stories, we are one space in which the entire story of the universe unfolds. One space in which galaxies, stars, your thoughts, someone's emotions, the meow of your cat appears.

We are one in many just like words in a sentence.

We are many in one just like words in a sentence.

And we are not even one, because if you erase the sentence then there's only space left, which isn't a sentence.

And what is space?

Not a word, not a story. But a potential for words and stories to appear. 🙂 ",1,1768825705.0,HeartEvolution,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qh2tst,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1qh2tst/the_tiny_confidence_boost_i_got_from_random_women/,The tiny confidence boost I got from random women this week,"I went through this long stretch where I kinda  stopped doing anything “extra” with my appearance. Not in a sad way exactly, more like, life got busy and it felt safer to blend in. Jeans, bun, whatever. Last weekend I found an old lipstick I used to love, this loud berry color, and on a whim I put it on before running errands. Immediately I had that tiny panic like, oh no, everyone’s gonna stare. But then something super unexpected happened. The first person to react was a woman in the grocery store who did a little double take and then said, “That color is PERFECT on you.” Not the forced compliment vibe, like she meant it. I laughed and said thanks, and I swear my shoulders went down two inches. Later, a barista (also a woman) handed me my coffee and went “ok yes, main character lip!” and we both cracked up. Then an older woman in the elevator at my building smiled at me and said it reminded her of a shade she wore in the 80s and how she missed it. None of these were big conversations, just these tiny human moments, but it felt like a chain reaction.



It made me realize how often women quietly hype each other up in ways that actually matter. Like we’re all walking around carrying a bunch of invisible stuff and then someone just  tosses you a little light. I’ve had plenty of days where I’m the one complimenting someone’s nails or their haircut because I know how it lands, but I never really noticed how much I needed it back until now. I came home and looked in the mirror and instead of picking myself apart, I just thought, wow, I look like me again. And the funniest part is, I don’t even think it was about lipstick. It was about being seen kindly, without it turning into a competition or a comment that feels gross. I wore it again the next day, even when I didn’t “have to,” and I felt more present in my own skin. Anyway, if you ever hesitate before giving a compliment to another woman because you think it’s corny, do it. It can genuinely change someone’s whole day, apparently including mine.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I went through six interview stages, did a full project demo for the senior team, and even had a casual coffee chat with the department head. They were giving me all the reassuring hints, saying things like we can really see you working here' and telling me I was 'definitely their top candidate.  
  
Then, of course, the very standard rejection email landed in my inbox. The classic we've decided to move forward with another candidate line. I replied asking for any feedback, you know, to improve for next time. Nothing. They ghosted me.  
I was at my breaking point. So this past weekend, I went on an application spree. I'm talking about 72 straight hours of applying to anything that looked even remotely related to my field.

This time it was her frustration about how she wanted us to join her goodbye dinner as a whole family for her brother’s wife. She says that the tradition is to go as a whole family and not like separate couples. The family is viewed as one unit, and it’s respectful to come as one, not individually. This goes the same for when visiting for a family member’s birthday, a dinner. It is the family that’s invited, not the couple.

She said she do doesn’t care how it happens in my family, how my siblings do this and that each has their own culture; that I knew ‘how things are done’ in her family before marrying her son. By marrying her son, I joined his family, this is my ‘new family’ and it comes with its expectations/traditions etc.

Shes previously hinted as naming our child when it comes to that because its tradition.. and changing my name to a more religious one. She still has me named as her ideal name on her phone.

Prior to getting married she once told me if I wear the wedding dress I choose, she would not invite her family because it’s embarrassing.

She’d want us to do mother daughter things, go out on coffee dates together etc and build relationship outside of her husband, communicate directly to her not through him etc

She also wants to teach us how things are done so we can pass the traditions on.

For more context, prior to this, she had expectations of being a dutiful daughter in law, who organises things - the social glue. To dress traditionally around the house + when visiting her family. (While keeping an eye and commenting on my clothing if I’m not modest enough) accompany her shopping, doctor’s appointments, running errands etc. This is what her daughters do and essentially she gained me as a new daughter. At the moment we live with them, so dinners were expected to be eaten together during the week, breakfast together every weekend. On top of this, going out with the whole family every weekend + visiting extended family once a week. I work full time + some weekends so the very little time I have left, I want to either spend alone to recharge or with my husband to maintain our relationship.

Since then, we have slowly placed our boundaries and I simply didn’t follow expectations I found unreasonable. I became more reserved and protective with my time and identity. Had dinners together some days a week, dinner and breakfast dates outside of the house, saying no to most of the family events they hold. I let my husband go as he pleases to his family’s events and I only join sometimes.

when I started placing boundaries, they felt like I didn’t integrate into the family, that their relationship with their son is more distant as they don’t do things together as they used to. In my view this is a natural consequence of getting married.

She has since come to reason with me and said she has let things go and understands I don’t want to join her on every errand, every event, every dinner etc. She understands that I work full time and are more reserved as a character. But just wants effort, a close relationship and traditions passed on.

Hubby and I argued so much to make it happen, and now that 75% of them are gone, I’m like… relieved but angry. why were my requests so unreasonable and taboo when I first asked for them. It’s soured my view of MIL and everyone’s asking me to look past it and move forward and she keeps asking to have a close relationship.

TDLR: MIL expects full and adherence to her family tradition, placing multiple expectations as how I should be as a DIL. From clothing, to family event planning, dinners together every day, family outings every week. I remained firm in my boundaries and while expectations have reduced, she still wants a closer relationship together and more integration.",1,1768825297.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

Clone of: Pdm Althaïr
Scent profile: Opens up with cinnamon with hints of cardamon's sweetness. Then a boozy vanilla gives it a character and praline makes it such a deadly winter frag like none other.
Some might mistake it to like coffee but it's the praline and vanilla mixing. Wore it twice and got compliments. If I had to pick a perfect winter datenight frag this would be the one.

MCaffine choco body butter - I haven't tried this brand until now. So I gave it a go. The body butter is moisturizing. But I feel like walking with chocolate coffee always

Nivea pearl body roll on - My favorite one, i used it in my college days. To get back to those days, I got this trial.Its very refreshing.

The Love and co. Japanese cherry blossom shimmer body oil - I have always been fascinated by the Japanese cherry blossom variety. I have seen my friend use the same variety in some brand from abroad. Ever since then I wanted to try it. I gave a go in trial, the smell is so good the texture is similar to applying rice flour on skin. It feels rough on the application and Idk what's the need of shimmer.

Sirona gold ore bathing bar - new brand for me. Yet to try.

Garnier facewash - going to try for first time. Let's see.

Rest all are perfumes. I wanted some good perfumes. I currently use bellavita date.

I ordered 2 mist from tnw, 1 from The Love and co and 2 from Plum

Nivea moisturizer is free in this order.

I think it's an exceptional product and have never had any issues serious enough for me to consider any other maker. 

With that said, I do have one slight thing that annoys me, and I'm wondering if anyone has found/made a solution. 

I typically make two to three 2.5-cup brews in the mornings when I'm home. On days that I'm heading into the office or hitting the road early, I will brew a larger batch. I will always preheat both the carafe and my travel mug to ensure I have nice, warm coffee as long as possible. But this has me wondering - has anyone made a printable adaptor that will allow me to brew a smaller batch brew directly into a travel mug? Removing the carafe from the equation altogether. 

I have found a carafe magnet bypass (https://makerworld.com/en/models/1743714-fellow-aiden-carafe-bypass-tool#profileId-1853214), but is that all I need? 

Doesn't the top of the carafe also open the bottom of the basket, allowing the coffee to empty? If so, has anyone seen/made an adaptor that would force the basket valve open?

I know that I could probably purchase and modify a second basket - but I would prefer just printing something myself if possible. 

Thoughts?

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Apologies in advance by how petty this will sound. 


I live in a student housing with other people. We have a dishwasher that works fine. Yet, my flatmates say they do not use it and prefer to wash by hand. Which is not true. I can tell because: 
- there are always more dishes than the ones I used; - one of them puts things in incorrectly - like cups on the part where plates should go, glass containers with labels in, 
- there are also personal items that only one person uses that often are also inside. 
- etc. 

I have also noticed at times when I ran the dishwasher that someone put dirty dishes inside while everything was clean and still drying. 

Then when they “handwash” things it is simply disgusting. They leave peaces of food and crumbs all over the sink and drying area. Often the dishes are still sticky, greasy to the touch and visibly dirty with pieces of food stuck to it (I wish I was kidding)! Apparently one or more of them thinks washing dishes/pots/pans/glassed doesnt include the outside. They never clean the sink or surrounding areas and it wasnt until we had a discussion on the group chat that they started to keep the sponge relatively less gross but still lays wet with crumbs in it. 

I can never eat out of the things they hand “wash” (it is simply gross) so I have my own things separately (like my own coffee mug/ my own pan, certain plates I use and others I don’t… etc.) 
This also serves to show how I know I am not the only one using the dishwasher. 

Now, the level of lazyness is beyond measure and they refuse to turn the dishwasher on or empty it. I don’t mind doing it when I have time but I don’t feel it is my responsibility alone. Now we have reached a point where every single item in the kitchen is dirty and inside the dishwasher and nobody will turn it on or empty. They start to eat out. 

Like I was away for ten days and when I returned the dishwasher was full and dirty. I wasnt even here. 

One of the flatmates said: “I think the person who uses it the most, should be the one to always take care of it”. Implying me. But I disagree. 

So, now we are on a standstill. There is one dish, one fork and a couple teaspoons on the drying rack. Which btw remains full, like they never put away the things they “wash”.  

Everything else is in the dishwasher. It has been 2 days and counting. 

I am all set because I keep my things separately (including disposable things and sponges that I keep clean and dry), mostly have pre-made meals that go directly in the oven and I hand wash my coffee things every night regardless of the dishwasher situation because I need it every morning and when we didn’t always run the dishwasher everyday. 

They pretend they don’t put things in the dishwasher but are happy to use the things that are cleaned in it and put away. 


Now, am I the asshole for thinking shared dishes and kitchen items are everyones responsibility? If we all use it, need to use it, we are all responsible for making sure it is clean and put away. But it is not fair to say I am the only one that needs to make sure it is clean and put away? ",1,1768823939.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1qh29fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1qh29fz/longterm_fearbased_breakup_with_avoidant_partner/,"Long-term, fear-based breakup with avoidant partner – am I misreading the signals or just stuck in limbo?","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for grounded, honest perspectives rather than motivational or “no contact works!” type advice.

I (M) was in a 3.5-year relationship with my ex (F). It was genuinely loving, emotionally close, and secure for most of its duration. We were best friends, no cheating, no abuse, no loss of attraction. A month before the breakup she was in tears telling me how deeply she loved me.

The breakup itself was fear-based. She said:

	•	She couldn’t see a future anymore

	•	She was scared about the distance / life pressures

	•	She felt like she was losing her best friend

	•	I’d been an amazing boyfriend

	•	She’d always love me

She also expressed regret in the conversation 

She works as a cancer ward nurse and has been under extreme emotional strain. Her family life is also very chaotic. She tends to avoid emotional confrontation and shuts down when overwhelmed (likely avoidant or fearful-avoidant).

At the breakup I didn’t beg or fight; I stayed composed even though I was devastated. She reached out really warmly to congratulate me on running a marathon (week 3), then I later asked her for coffee (week 5) and she said it was too early and she didn’t want to make things harder. I replied respectfully and didn’t push.

Since then (now \~10 weeks post breakup):

	•	No contact from either side

	•	She hasn’t unfollowed my close friends or my disabled brother’s account

	•	She still has our photos on Instagram

	•	She hasn’t publicly erased me from her life

	•	She’s otherwise silent online

On my side, I’ve:

	•	Travelled

	•	Run a marathon

	•	Grown my business significantly

	•	Been in somatic therapy weekly

	•	Worked on my anxious attachment

	•	Journaled and reflected deeply

	•	Stayed fully no contact

	•	Not chased, begged, or used mutual friends

Emotionally I’m wrecked. I still love her deeply. I don’t want someone new. I want her. But the silence is destroying me and I’m stuck in this suspended limbo where nothing is resolved.

The confusing part:

On one hand:

	•	She hasn’t erased me socially

	•	She expressed love and grief at the breakup

	•	The relationship quality was genuinely high

	•	The breakup was fear-based, not attraction-based

On the other hand:

	•	10 weeks of total silence

	•	Forward-oriented coping

	•	No repair attempts

	•	No reach-out at all

I keep oscillating between:

“This isn’t over, she’s just avoidant and scared”

and

“She’s moved on and I’m delusional.”

I’m now at a point where:

	•	I can’t hold no-contact forever

	•	But I also don’t want to sabotage any remaining chance

	•	I don’t know whether a single low-pressure reach-out would help or just confirm rejection

	•	I don’t know if I’m reading meaningful ambivalence or just clinging to scraps

My questions:

	1.	Does her keeping our photos and social ties actually mean anything, or is that meaningless cope?

	2.	Is 10 weeks of silence in this type of breakup a death sentence or still within a “grey zone”?

	3.	Would one clean, low-pressure message now improve or worsen the odds?

	4.	Am I being realistic or emotionally delusional about the possibility of reconciliation?

	5.	If you were in my position, what would you actually do next?

I don’t want sugarcoating.

I don’t want pickup-artist tactics.

I don’t want false hope.

I just want the truth.

Sorry in advance by how petty this will sound. 


I live in a student housing with other people. We have a dishwasher that works fine. 

Yet, my flatmates  say they do not use it and prefer to wash by hand. Which isn’t true. 

I can tell because: 
- there are always more dishes than the ones I used; - one of them puts things in incorrectly - like cups on the part where plates should go, glass containers with labels in, 
- there are also personal items that only one person uses that often are also inside. 
- etc. 

I have also noticed at times when I ran the dishwasher that someone put dirty dishes inside while everything was clean and still drying. 

When they “handwash” things it is simply disgusting! They leave peaces of food and crumbs all over the sink and drying area. Often the dishes are still sticky, greasy to the touch and visibly dirty with pieces of food stuck to it (I wish I was kidding)! I have pictures of it too. 


Apparently one or more of them thinks washing dishes/pots/pans/glassed doesnt include the outside part. They never clean the sink or surrounding areas and it wasnt until we had a big discussion on the group chat and I pointed out that they started to keep the sponge relatively less gross, but still lays wet with crumbs in it. 

I never use the things they hand “wash” (it is simply gross) so I have my own things separately (like my own coffee mug/ my own pan, certain plates I use and others I don’t… etc.) This also serves to show how I know I am not the only one using the dishwasher. 

Now, the level of lazyness is beyond measure and they refuse to turn the dishwasher on or empty it. I don’t mind doing it when I have time but I don’t feel it is my responsibility alone. Now we have reached a point where every single item in the kitchen is dirty and inside the dishwasher and nobody will turn it on or empty it. They are avoiding cooking. 

Recently, I was away for ten days and when I returned home the dishwasher was full and dirty. I wasnt even here, so to pretend I am the only one using it is ridiculous! 

One of the flatmates said: “I think the person who uses it the most, should be the one to always take care of it”. Implying me. But I disagree and refuse. 

So, now we are on a standstill. There is one dish, one fork and a couple teaspoons on the drying rack. Which btw remains full, as they never put away the things they “wash”.  

Everything else is in the dishwasher. It has been 2 days and counting. 

I am all set because I keep my things separately (including disposable things and sponges that I keep clean and dry), I mostly have pre-made meals that go directly in the oven and I hand wash my coffee things every night regardless of the dishwasher situation because I need it every morning and we didn’t always run the dishwasher everyday in the past. 

They pretend they don’t put things in the dishwasher but are happy to use the things that are cleaned in it and put away. Which I find extremely hypocritical. 


Now, am I the jerk for thinking shared dishes and kitchen items are everyone’s responsibility? If we all use it, need to use it, we are all responsible for making sure it is clean and put away. But it is not fair to say I am the only one that needs to make sure it is clean and put away?

I want the ability to make a large (8 oz or more) cup of coffee before work.

I also want to have options that taste good without adding any milk, creamer, syrups etc because I don’t want to go crazy with sugar consumption. A way to get just hot water for tea would be great too.

This is my second time posting here, I’m pretty new to writing. After a very helpful feedback, I rewrote my first chapter, and I’d love to know what you think about it. 

In particular, I’m curious whether you can see the FMC’s inner thoughts and personality. I also feel like my writing is still a bit rigid, as if the transitions between lines aren’t very smooth if that makes sense.

Also, is it engaging enough for a first chapter? Does it sound cringe?

Any advice on improving my overall writing/feedback or general opinion is welcomed and much appreciated! Thank you!

"" “Eve, we’re out of almond milk!”

James’ voice pulled me out of my thoughts. In the background, I could register the familiar clicking of the mugs, and the distant sound of hushed voices. 

Without realizing, as if  I was on auto-pilot,  I made my way towards the storage room.  

When I entered the smell of dust hit me full force, a hard contrast to the freshly grounded coffee outside, one that made me scrunch my nose in disgust. Quickie, I grabbed a milk carton from the improvised shelf and rushed outside, half because of the smell, half because of the urgent tone in my employee’s voice.

*Another busy Saturday it seems, at least I have three more hours to go.* *Then I can finally get some sleep. Just the thought of my nice, cozy bed is enough to fill me with enough positivity to finish this day.*

“Eve!”

“Coming!” I yelled, increasing my pace back inside.

James was putting the coffee into the portafilter, his slight frame coming into view. His face was drawn into a frown, as if he was deeply focusing on the task. 

Making myself useful, I wasted no time frosting the milk for the almond cappuccino our regular client, Stacy, had ordered.

A slight breeze slipped into the small cafe as the door opened, making me shiver from the cold. 

*I should buy a new coat, the weather seems colder this autumn*. 

“Hi! Welcome to the Golden Bean Cafe! If you can give me a minute..” I quickly said to the new customer, my face still facing the counter as I waited for the milk to frost.  

A loud bang made me jump, hot liquid splashing my legs. I took a sharp inhale at the contact, the stinging pain in my leg making me close my eyes for a second. 

*Hot coffee is no joke*.

Looking down I could see the lower part of my calf turning red, the pain slowly fading. 

*Hopefully I won't get any blisters, that surely won’t be fun.* 

As I turned around towards the new customer, I almost dropped my own cup of frosted milk. What surely must be a celebrity was standing in this rundown place’ doorway. He was tall, with short blonde hair and a face that looked like it belonged on one of those magazine cover.

He looked somewhat above all of us, an air of arrogance surrounding him. One that was helped by his right eyebrow being slightly upwards, like he was judging this very place.

As he walked forward his suit, that fit him perfectly might I add, was clinging onto his body, shining in the dim light like it was made out of silk. 

He definitely looked odd with the molding walls in the background and the crooked window to his right. A window through which I could see a Rolls Royce parked outside, right at the entrance. 

I didn't know much about cars, but even I could recognize the Spirit of Ecstasy.

*He would get jumped for sure with a car like that in this part of town.*

His piercing black eyes made me freeze on the spot, feeling more like prey than anything else. 

*Or maybe not. There’s something dangerous about him.*

He winked at me and gave me a slick smile for only a second, then his face turned serious as he made his way towards the back of the cafe. 

Both me and James were stuck looking at him as he opened his coat and sat down with far more grace than I would attribute to a man his size. The old wooden chair still cracked under him, sending a shiver of unease through me. 

*We wouldn't be able to afford a lawsuit from someone like him, and I wouldn't be able to find another job soon enough.* 

His eyes locked onto James’ and lifting his right hand he made a small gesture with his pointer finger. His jaw was clenched, his whole body looking tense, as if he was annoyed by something.

That small gesture was enough to break James’ stance, who suddenly ran past the counter towards the man’s table. 

I stared, stunned in disbelief. James, who was always in control no matter what, was now running desperate toward this man like his life depended on it.

“Evy, if it’s not too much I would like my cappuccino.” Stacy’s annoyed voice brought me back to reality. 

I forced my gaze away from the unbelievable scene and focused on finishing that damned cappuccino. Moving as quickly as I could I began to remake the coffee James had spilled. *I hope I won't miss whatever is about to happen*. 

“Here you go, have a nice day!” The cheerfulness in my voice didn’t, in any way, match my mood, and by the look on Stacy’s face, she could tell.

She said nothing, grabbing the coffee and heading towards the exit.

*Well, I guess that was my fault.*

Anyway, I still felt relieved by her departure. After all, with her gone I could resume my attention to the man. 

James was standing up, his back facing me, but I could still see his distress. There was sweat on the back of his neck, and his fingers were trembling. That man on the other hand looked completely in control, if not somehow amused by James’ reaction. 

He leaned forward, whispering something that made James take a step back, then, as if he knew I was watching, his eyes locked onto mine again. 

I could feel my face redden, shame filling me at being caught spying. The stranger didn’t look bothered by it though. He stood up, walking past James who was somehow frozen. 

He slipped his right hand into his pocket, the movement lifting his jacket just enough for me to see it.

*God, he was wearing a gun.*

My heart skipped a bit and suddenly I found myself as stuck as James is. *I’ve seen way too many true-crime documentaries that started like this.* 

To add to that, there was something about this man that made my skin crawl. I felt like he wasn’t fully sane, and far too soon for my liking, he was standing before me, the same slick smile on his face he walked in with. 

“Evening.” His voice was deep, holding a note of amusement, as if my fear was entertaining. And with him so close I was hit with the smell of expensive cologne.

*Of course he wears Tom Ford.*

His eyes traveled up, scanning the menu. “Is this the part where I pretend I understand the menu and order the shittiest thing? Or would you put me out of my misery and recommend something to me.” 

A laugh escaped my lips, and finally I felt my muscles relaxing. “Sorry?”

There was no way a man like this didn’t know how to order coffee. He looked like he could fly straight to Italy for it. In one of the private jets he, most likely, owned.

His smile brightened, making him appear less intimidating somehow. “I’m not really a coffee drinker.”

“If you like sweet things, the frosted caramel latte is amazing.""

“I do love a sweet thing.” He winked at me, making me laugh again.

The whole high school pickup lines didn’t fit his businessman appearance. *It surely made for a funny contrast though.*

 “Give me a medium. To go.”

Wasting no time I began to make his order. After all, the quicker I finish the faster he leaves.

“Here you go.” I placed the cup on the cupboard, taking the opportunity to study him again. This time his attention was focused on his phone, texting someone.

His brows were drawn into a frown, his lips pressed into a tight line, as if he wasn’t texting at all but doing something really mentally taxing. He lifted his right hand, eyes never leaving the phone, and grabbed the cup taking a sip.

His head shot up, a shocked expression on his face. “This is actually good.” 

My eyes narrowed at him. I couldn’t help feeling offended*. I worked as a barista for 4  years, of course my coffee is good.* 

“That would be 5.45.” I said through gridded teeth.

He laughed as he reached inside his jacket pulling out his wallet.

“Here you go.” He handed me a 100 dollar bill. “Keep the change.”

My mouth opened involuntarily at that. *He was definitely insane.*

""That's 90 dollars of tips!”

He didn't say anything, just slightly lifted his shoulders as if saying ‘so what?’

“Quality is expensive, Eveline.” He lifted his cup, as if cheering me. 

“I’m Mikail, ” he added, taking another sip, “ and you just made the best coffee of my life.”

He gave me another smile, this time looking somewhat goofy with the milk stains around his mustache.

“See you around.” With that he turned towards the exit and began to walk out, giving me a great view of his ass swinging from side to side, as if he was a Victoria secret’ runway model. 

*Arrogant was definitely the right word for him.* 

Looking around I could see James still stuck beside the table, his eyes focused on a corner, as he still was lost deep in his thoughts.  
*Who is this Mikail? And why was James behaving like that? ""*",1,1768823661.0,writers,2,1.0,False

I’m in my early 30sF and am finally having the capacity to process some of my traumas. Unfortunately, I’m in between jobs and not seeing my established therapist, tho still grateful to see my pdoc and get my meds. 

It’s hitting in the worst ways. I have CPTSD from emotional/verbal abuse to the point that I have a restraining order against my one of my parents - obviously I don’t see or talk to either of them in that case as they’re still married. 

I have to fucking get this shit out to sort out for my therapist if nothing else. 

I remembered over the last couple years that I had been molested by a female babysitter at about 4 years old, was exposed to some very very graphic media at that time as well. I only remember cuts from the movie we watched and then her and I under a blanket together. I still remember the window to the left and the industrial white walls. But not really anything else. 

l was highly, highly precocious at a very young age and I always just understood everything already and started trying to do things early. 

I moved out at 18 into a shared living space and crushed on a guy in the same house. A year into living there, while drinking with the rest of the house, I had said over and over how much I wanted to fuck him for a month or so after we accidentally found each other on Craigslist, aha. I remembered being put to bed, couldn’t tell you if it was by him or another housemate. And then I woke up on my back with him in me and between my legs. I was so confused because it was so so so much later than when I’d been put to bed. 

I had been passed out cold.

In 2017, I ended up in a complete clusterfuck of a situation where I still don’t know if I was drugged or not because I don’t have immediate access to medical records (hospital closed a year later and a lot of things have happened since)… But I distinctly recall being told that I had tested positive for cocaine in the hospital (then psych ward) - I fucking swear on everything that I would’ve NEVER taken that consciously, it wasn’t even in my wheelhouse if I was 21 and drunk. It wasn’t my thing. I’ve talked to a couple therapists, I’ve talked to a couple psychiatrists. They say I was drugged. 

There was a man that was present overall during that general situation that I made the mistake of hooking up with once out of the psych hospital. He didn’t stop when I asked him to stop playing with my ass. Instead he put more of his finger(s) in and then kept fucking me then… PIssed in me. Fucking pissed while fucking me without warning. He had a loaded gun on the bottom coffee table shelf, encouraged me to hold it, held it himself. I don’t remember if that was before or after. I never saw him in person after that. 

He was a man I know from the workplace and I worked in a very professional, esteemed area. A man that worked with people in vulnerable positions day in and day out. I saw he got married, had a daughter. I still shudder and when I think about the texts he sent me regarding incest and him encouraging me in a genuinely mental fragile state to do horrible things. 

Maybe more minor, I remember finding out a man I’d hooked up with had recorded us. I leaned over the wrong edge of the bed and caught the red blinking light. 

I feel disgusting and I feel hallow. All I’ve ever been is a mirror for others and I’m grateful that even though I’m in between jobs at the moment, I should be set to go back to therapy ASAP as job interviews pan out. 

I drank so heavily for a decade. Highest BAC was 0.402, so much horror with all of that. I’ve only in the last couple years gotten that under control and now I’m back on my feet enough (and SOBER!) that… All of that is rushing back at a nauseating rate. 

I needed to hash this out before I head to therapy because I don’t think I’ve ever just… Outright admitted this all, especially on a timeline. I don’t think I’ve even acknowledged it all. 

I hate this all. I hate that a lot of these are unique experiences at all. I just never have vocalized mine.

1qh1v7k,https://i.redd.it/kkpmflgnlaeg1.jpeg,"""Why do you do this? Why do you do Kairos prison ministry?""","2 Corinthians 12:15

""I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?""

Truth be told about many spiritual endeavors, there are many Christian ministries that exist for the purpose of being ministered too. But that would not do for Paul. Paul isn’t just willing to give money, time, or effort, he’s ready to be completely used up for their souls’ salvation, growth, and eternal welfare. It’s voluntary and joyful (""most gladly""), not grudging.

Despite Paul’s deepening affection and sacrificial service, the Corinthians’ response has been lukewarm or even diminished. Perhaps influenced by false teachers and their own immaturity.

Paul’s words for us today captures a ministry that’s not about personal gain, emotional fulfillment for the giver, or building a platform. It’s about gladly being ""spent"" for the souls of others, even when the response is minimal, lukewarm, or nonexistent.

The prison environment that Kairos steps into actively discourages Christian community. Prayer gatherings there are suspect, confrontation is often forced to discourage that sort of thing. And it's ironic because that's exactly what we encourage, small group dynamics, prayer and share formation, fellowship, consistent witness through their actions, and planting seeds wherever they can in that hostile soil. We are, by the nature of our mission statement, contrary to the prison culture. We are there to exhort them into being the very thing the prison needs them not to be.

And yet they let us come.

They even provide space and resources for that work.

And somehow, The Holy Spirit isn’t blocked by their reluctance or those concrete walls and bars.

Kairos Prison Ministry exists precisely for this, to share Christ’s love and forgiveness with incarcerated men, women, and youth, aiming to bring hope, healing, transformation, and to build Christian community inside prisons. That's our mission. Every voluntary is there of their own accord, and is paying their own way, or others are giving in order to help their friends to participate. 

Volunteers demonstrate God’s unconditional love through talks, fellowship, letters of encouragement, and simple acts like baking cookies. The goal, our motives, isn’t quick conversions for stats but hearts changed. Taking responsibility, experiencing forgiveness, and finding freedom in the truth.

So, to the question:

""Why do you do this? Why do you do Kairos prison ministry?""

It seems rooted in the same Pauline conviction. A deepening love for souls that doesn’t demand reciprocity. You’re there to spend and be spent; time, energy, emotion, even facing the hostility of the setting, for their spiritual warming, growth, and eternal welfare. It’s voluntary and joyful, even amid challenges, because it’s about imitating Christ who spent Himself fully without guarantee of return.

And so this should be convicting for ""the church"". Especially when we are tempted to minister only when it ministers back to us? 

And so, this is why our Kairos ministry focus scripture comes out of the discourse in Matthew 25:31–46

""I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.""

Prison ministry is explicitly named here as one of the marks of true discipleship. In Kairos ministry, the ""Jesus cookies"", letters, retreats, and consistent presence are tangible ways of ""coming to"" prisoners. Kairos is clothing the naked in Christ's garments, in dignity. Visiting the sick in spirit when we enter the prison walls. And this is even more true and real as addiction, depression, and anxiety is ramping up. 

I refer to Kairos as ""raw Christianity"" when speaking about it to others. I explain that it strips away those churchy comforts we all have experienced, and lays bare the test of a genuine faith. Just by existing it asks the question, ""Did we serve Christ by serving the overlooked, the uncomfortable, the ones who can’t (or won’t) repay us?"" 

Kairos intentionally goes into places of isolation, hostility, and raw brokenness, not for applause, but because Jesus explicitly names it:

""I was in prison and you came to me.""

That's right, we're going there to see Jesus.

And to bring him homemade treats, not gourmet gestures, they’re acts of dignity and warmth in a dehumanizing environment, like a cool drink of water. Or in their case, hot coffee.

Letters of encouragement that say, ""You are seen, valued, and worth our kindness"". Forgiveness talks, and community-building, a consistent presence; these are the agape gifts of the Kairos, even amid suspicion or cultural pushback. All ways of ""coming to"" prisoners.

And now, more so than ever, the Kairos Prison Ministry faces a challenge that is growing in its intensity. Mental health struggles, including severe depression and anxiety, are significantly elevated among incarcerated populations. More and more, every time I sit with with them and share in their prayers the most common theme is addressing their addictions. You see it literally burned into their index fingers. A literal imprint of the bondage many now carry; addiction’s toll written on their skin that can’t be concealed in those vulnerable moments like prayer circles. And in our intimate conversations they confess their desire to overcome this pain. 

You can see the tears well up as the gravity bears down on them. This poison is killing them, and they know it. But they can't stop.

And so it breaks your heart.

And every visit you hope that they haven't paid the ultimate and grave price for this choice. The gravity hits hard, they know it’s killing them; body, mind, soul, and yet the pull feels unbreakable. It breaks your heart because you’re seeing souls God loves, trapped in chains that go far beyond physical bars. Amplified by vicious loops, by prison stressors; isolation, violence, lack of access to treatment. And leaving that place is not the solution. Overdose risk skyrockets post-release, up to 40 times higher in the first weeks due to a lowered tolerance.

So what's a Kairos to do?

We do what we've always done. We tell them face to face, ""you are not your addiction; you are a child that God is pursuing."" You affirm their worth. You point to real freedom. You plant seeds that the Holy Spirit can water into repentance, renewal, and steps toward sobriety. You model persistence.

Your coming back again and again is so powerful. It literally saves lives. More than food and nutrition. It feeds their soul and lifts them out of that depression and darkness. You're like a tiny match in total darkness that illuminates the whole universe. 

You are literally being that light that Jesus spoke of. The light of the world.

The tears you see?

They’re often the first crack where light enters; conviction, sorrow leading to repentance. Tying to an attitude change, encouraging pro-social behavior, and spiritual transformation. Not magic, but God’s work through a faithful pouring out.

Friends, 

The church must rise to this. The church MUST participate. More volunteers, more advocacy for better in-prison treatment, and prayers covering every facility. 

Church,

Kairos isn't just visiting prisoners, we're coming to Christ in them. That hope we carry in; your cookies and letters, posters, place mats and prayers on a paper chain, even when it feels fragile, is piercing the darkness. Every tear witnessed, every prayer offered, every ""Jesus cookie"" shared is kingdom work. Yielding softened hearts, fresh mercies, no losses to the grave price, and strength renewed for all. 

Church,

The ONE who sets captives free is with us in that prison. And he's calling you ALL into serving HIM in that place. Yes, church; the call is clear, urgent, and straight from the heart of Christ Himself.

Will you answer that call?

Volunteer. Advocate. Pray. 

This isn’t about guilt, it’s about grace overflowing. Jesus came for the sick, the captive, and the broken. When we go where He goes, we find Him waiting there for us. And in serving the ""least,"" we serve Him. If you’re feeling that tug right now, take the step. Reach out to Kairos, talk to your pastor, pray for clarity. The harvest is plentiful, the workers few, but the Lord of the harvest is calling for more hands to go into the mission field.

The church rises when we answer together:

""In His name, who breaks every chain, yes Lord, send us. Amen.""

We were trying to order an Uber and she offered her phone, handed it to me already unlocked. While I was typing in the address, a text banner popped up from her boyfriend (30M). It was one of those preview notifications, so I didn’t even have to click anything, it just appeared. It said something like, “If you gain more weight like last time I’m not doing this again.” Not joking, not teasing. Just cold. I froze because I felt like I’d read something I shouldn’t have, even though it was literally on the screen in front of me. I handed her phone back fast and she didn’t notice (or she pretended not to). I felt sick the rest of the night acting normal, and now I can’t stop thinking about it.



Here’s why I’m stuck. Maya has mentioned being insecure about her body before, but she’s never said her boyfriend comments on it. In public he acts supportive, posts cute photos, brings her coffee, that kind of boyfriend. But this text was so specific and mean, like it’s not his first time saying it. If I tell her, I’m worried it turns into “why were you reading my texts” even though I wasn’t. I’m also worried she’ll feel embarrassed and then isolate, because she does that when she’s hurt. If I don’t tell her, I feel like I’m helping him hide it, and also I’m going to act weird around him forever. We’re supposed to go on a group weekend trip next month and I’m already dreading being around him with that in my head. Part of me wants to just ask her gently, like “hey, are things okay with you two, is he ever critical about your body,” but I don’t know if that’s opening a can of worms. I also don’t want to plant insecurity in her if that message was a one off, but it didn’t read like a one off. What should I do here, tell her straight up what I saw, bring it up indirectly, or keep my mouth shut and just be supportive if she brings it up first?

The means as well as the ends.,"I've made some posts over the years. Some about me, and my journey, looking for literal relatability or understanding. Some poetic, reaching out for emotional threads, or attachments based on my writing style, and my mind flow. Some about philosophy, looking for like minds, fellow thinkers and reachers. Some about interests, looking for a foundation based on activity and something tangible.

How about this time I be as clear as I can, with no pretenses. You read this if you're here, if you can. You listen to what I have, and what I think. And you respond, if it means something to you. If you're *weary*, like I am. If you need something but can't find it. If you're tired of being told to suppress your needs. Settle for less. That your needs are wrong. That your search is meaningless.  
You listen to my strength. You bear witness to my weakness. You vow to share yours with me in turn.

**What I need:**

* A witness to my existence: I won't explain the why here; this is clarity. I don't need to. It's intrinsic, and it's who I am. It's my meaning, at least for now.
* To witness you: I need you to need that too. Maybe not as much as I do, but enough. What do I mean by a witness? It's what I view as a proof of existence. Not the only proof. Not even the only proof that matters, not even that yours or my existence needs a proof. It's what I want. The empathy given and taken from another parallel life. From the knowledge that you mean something to them, and them to you.
* An end to loneliness: The loneliness doesn't from lack of self-worth. I am worth a lot, and so are you. We must share our worth. As we are. We will change over time, if we want to, and then we will be worth something different. But still enough. Always enough. The world does not define either of our worth's. The loneliness I feel is intrinsic, and frigid. It's existential. I was born with it, and it will never fade. *You can't fix it. I don't need fixing. I can't fix yours*. Yet I know what I need, and I can provide it to you in return. True understanding. A flame that won't melt the ice but will warm us beyond just the suffering. The gentle warmth from a fellow shoulder in a cave of ice means more than anything when all you've ever known is the blizzard.
* Your Strength: Every step of every waking moment takes immense strength and courage. For some people, it costs almost nothing. Its natural. It's life. For me, and people like us, it's a war. A war against being suspended in a world of chaos, and of forgetting why we bother to walk at all. The crushing weight of the world, of humanity, of expectations, of ourselves... Let me walk beside you. Not because we are weak, but because we can be stronger with support. Perhaps not strong enough. But stronger.
* Comfort: This isn't codependency. I'm not making an offer to force us to be alive for the sake of it. I don't want us to simply form a new cage to live in; one of our own making this time. It's about more than just help and support. It's about the wants, and not just the needs. I am hilarious, I'm sure you are too. I want to be your joy and your entertainment. The hand that holds yours in the light, and in the darkness. I need it myself. A soft joke in the same cave will further shatter the notion of the blizzard.
* *Commitment*: Why do some relationships last, and others fail? I don't have all the answers. Nobody does. There are theories; there are differences between real life tangible encounters and online interactions, but it doesn't matter. If there is any hope, we must fight for it. Even if it's hard. Even if the messages get shorter. If the calls start to feel like an obligation. We must believe that it is temporary, and we must remember the core of why. I need your fight, and I will give mine. This is not a fantasy. It's our reality.
* Curiosity: I want your mind. And I want to share mine. It's the core of my value. I don't offer it lightly, but I want to share it. It's all of me. The grand philosophical ideals. The small victories. The miniscule desires, the mundane details of your life. The impossible dreams. The sorrows. The nostalgia. The failures. I want to explore your thoughts, feelings, ambitions... Without shame. Without judgement. I want you to want to search for something with me. Even if it's hard. Even if it's slow. I want to learn and grow with you by my side.
* You: I am what I am, and you are what you are. The self is beautiful, as long as it's yours. Share it with me and hear mine. It's all I have to offer, and all I need in return. At the end of the world. It will be just us. If we were the last two people facing the final abyss, what would our life have been? Will you lament that we didn't have more? Will you resent us? Me? Resent the world? Resent existence? It doesn't matter to me. You are enough. The ends and the means. There will be more, but we can be each other's foundations. Or the architecture. Whichever you prefer.

*All that matters is if this made you feel anything*, and if you can offer and receive something that we both want. If you're scared that I've said everything, then just ask. If you want to know more, then ask. We can have the same conversation as many times as it takes. If you're intimidated by my loudness, then let me hear your quiet thoughts. I'm quiet too. I'm shy too. This took years to come out, perhaps a lifetime depending on your perspective.

That wasn't clear. I said this was going to be about clarity. It was still stupidly, amateurishly poetic. It still appealed to emotion. I still want you to gauge my style, and my philosophy. I didn't have a plan. It isn't everything I need or want, maybe I made mistakes, but it's a start. 

**Who I am (Optional but necessary pragmatism):**

I figured that starting with reasonably clear (? I tried) definitions of what I want, need, and value would show my sincerity and intentionality. The purpose was to seek loudly. It's nice and romantic to brush hands with someone at a coffee shop and now they're your soulmate, but it gets harder the more demanding and complex you are (and how socially isolated). It's not necessarily a good/bad thing; it just is a thing.

However, it still matters who I am, what I like, and how we can get along in a pragmatic sense (I hate pragmatism, let me live in my ideals dammit).  
I think it's been clear from the above that I need some sort of relational catalyst for motivation and meaning in a world that has lost that for me. It means that I struggle to do things sometimes. The word that didn't exist when I was younger is ""avolition"", and I think it's a reasonably accurate description of me and my state. It's not a diagnosis; it's a symptom of being what I am. Is there a solution? I don't know yet. I'm not a problem to be solved, I'm just an existential anomaly. But me being here means I've identified at least one possible course of action, and some sort of desire. The bare minimum to be human?

The point of all that is that I like things, but I don't always do things, even the ones that I like. I'm also terrible at finishing things, partly because of motivation, and partly because I don't like it when things end. If I don't finish, it's still a nice open thread in my mind that I can pursue whenever I want, it's just the want is the problem. There are other times where I'll hyperfixate and devour something. It just depends. I don't like schedules, I just like doing the things that I want, when I want.

An emotional/philosophical connection is more important. I think it can be enough. But ideally, we need to ground ourselves with something tangible. Anything. Something we do together, or create together, or regular check ins/voice calls, body doubling etc. I prefer text at first, but I think we need to voice chat rather soon for the tangible, and also just to see if the vibes work beyond the theoretical.

Here's the list of potential activities that I do on my own/want to do.

* It's probably clear that I like books and philosophy. I wouldn't consider myself well read on either, although I am quite familiar with philosophy. I've also never really had any book friends to feed off of their motivation. Maybe we can start a book club?
* I play video games of course. I like them all. Big ones, tiny indie ones, silly ones, but I have to be in the mood for specific ones. I feel like co-op PVE games tend to lack depth and be a little boring sadly, as they are the bulk of what people play together. I'm not a gamey sort of person and I value immersion. I like League of Legends a lot for the complexity and pure moment-to-moment engagement. It's very absorbing. Play with me. Join us.
* I used to enjoy studying. I was very self-motivated to learn for myself in the past, and I definitely want that again for the future if I can manage it. I ended up doing computer science in university until I realised that the real world and I weren't exactly compatible. It wasn't me it was the world. It was a bad break up too, lots of loose ends. In my dream world I'd be some kind of academic, and maybe that ship hasn't completely sailed. We'll see. Let's learn some stuff together, read poetry, study things the world has deemed useless, pore over ancient texts and esoteric symbols. Let's have a study group.
* I love kitters and I have two of them. They ground me when I'm about to float off into despair land. Accept and sent pictures.

I think a lot. I feel many things. I also feel nothing sometimes. I'm on both sides of the despair and whimsy spectrum. I feel like part 2 of the thesis on myself has been truer to my actual personality. This is what I'm really like beyond all the honesty and truth. I'll joke about everything and tease you all the time. I'll ask you probing questions, and equally nonsense ones. You'll never see it coming. I'll support your bad decisions, and your good ones.

The DLC would consist of:

**Undiscovered systems**

**Ability to use L.I.S.T. and their Services**

**Class M / Colony Ship Builder**

**Space Station Builder**

**Colony Builder**

With those elements together the player would be able to create a Colony system, setup a capitol world (if more than one world and moon) and expand outward, creating their own faction or Joining an existing.

This could be considered an END GAME type DLC as this would be mostly for players tired of going through the Unity and just want to stay in a reality for a long while or for the Building community.

But this will give players the chance to use the Credits that they can easily acquire as well as put Outposts to real good use cause as we all know, at some point we just have to many resources to know what to do with and the outposts start becoming stagnant, feeling less alive.

Yes we could move to a player home or build an outpost near a city or colony, but it is not the same.

Players being able to build a colony of their own would be the ultimate player home dwelling, I mean we start the game with nothing, so why not have the ability to have a destination outside of Unity to strive for besides outposts.

Below I will layout how I could see this all working out together.

__________________________________________________________

**Undiscovered systems**

Later in the game after a certain point (if first time playing anyway), player has a chance see a ""Ping"" on the star map with a ""?"" on it, if player chooses to fly to it, it can be one of a few things, a Fleet of enemies, an asteroid field, a Comet, an anomaly of some type, or an Undiscovered or Unclaimed star system.

When the player enters the system a Quest activates to report to L.I.S.T. about the newly discovered system.

When the player meets the L.I.S.T. agent, they will give a brief explanation about their role in helping you with representing you in all legal negotiations with the other powerful factions out there about your rights for claiming the system for a Fee.

If player chooses to claim, they pay a fee for services rendered to ensure all factions understand you are the legal owner of the system and then you fill out the registry, which allows the player to Name the Star System and all bodies within it, this will also later include any unknown life forms found, the player can rename.

or player can choose to not claim the system and instead get rewarded with a finders fee. (individual Planets and moons can still be claimed for a short time, but the right to name the Star system is no longer available)

__________________________________________________________

**Ability to use L.I.S.T. and their Services**

L.I.S.T. can be used to claim single moons or planets for colonization, and if the player found a system and decided to not claim it, each planet and moon will appear on a ""Newly Registered"" list for a short time for the player to purchase individually.

Otherwise the player can fill out a L.I.S.T. application which askes what the player is looking for on a planet or moon and give you a list of available choices  if available.

Then like before, player just pays a fee.

_____________________________________________________________

**Class M / Colony Ship Builder**

Now that the player has a Colony location, it is time to get a ship worthy for a colony.

The Class M / Colony ship builder is a bit different than the regular ship builder, it has different habitat styles as well as a few new ones.

But it is not as maneuverable than the lower class ships, it cannot land on a planet, instead players have to use a shuttle bay to go to dock to something or land on a surface as it is to big beside individual ships docking with it or if players added it, a permanent ship dock that allows an active ship from the players inventory to connect to it.

The Class M / Colony ship could be made to fit military needs, but as a single vessel that cannot maneuver like the smaller vessels, damage could become an issue fast, but as a Colony ship, player can make it into a movable player home if they want to, assign Crew to operate it when the player is not there, even follow the player in their smaller class ship if ordered to.

So the player cold setup a Second in command and order them to stay in orbit at the location, Go Home (Colony capital world), or Follow them as they will take point.

But figured having a Colony ship available for realism, plus it would help with a few other Colony builder things later, such as an Arboretum habitat which can keep alien plant life from other worlds safe and alive for transport (Or for ship crews viewing enjoyment) and an Animal keeper habitat to hold alien animals for live transport.

This could open up other mission board opportunities, Captures/acquires for study for UC, to poaching for the crimson fleet.

Big ship, a lot of room.

__________________________________________________________

**Space Station Builder**

Honestly just wanted to make one and thought that any real powerful faction would have one at least for communication relay possibilities for fleet movements within the system, especially from planet side to space side.

Many variations could be considered

- Research station

- Defense station

- Customs/Inspections

- player home

and so on.

______________________________________________________________

**Colony Builder**

I could see using a Colony Beacon to place down the Boundary for the build.

The Colony Beacon, by default would look similar to the Outpost beacon, but instead of the Circle boundary the outpost uses, the Colony Beacon would use a Square boundary.

This will allow Colony Beacons to snap their boundaries together at the seams to increase the total size of the buildable area, but each beacon would still be their own zone (unless changed)

If the player selects the Colony beacon to bring up its menu options, they would see:

- Move Beacon: Move Beacon to another area within the boundary

- Rename Beacon: Rename the Beacon to represent the zone (Residential District, Commercial District, and so on)

- Change Icon: The Icon seen on the map can be changed to represent what the zone is used for (Residential, Commercial, Government, Medical, shipyard, Starport and so on).

- Change Design: Player can change the Default look of the Colony beacon into something else that represents the zone better (A fountain, A statue, A monument and so on)

- Merge Beacon: Merge Colony beacon with another Colony Beacon, this will keep the boundary the same, just one less beacon, the merged beacons will control both zones together as one beacon (So instead of two separate Resident zones, now it would be one big resident zone)

- Exit: leave the menu

- Unmerge: shows only if merged, this allows player to unmerge the beacons so they can make changes to the area.

______________


After the Colony Beacon is placed, the player could then place **Foundation"" parts down if they wanted, this would level out the ground for a more flat surface and buildings and such can be placed on them, including other foundation types.

The Foundations can fill the whole boundary or player can use smaller ones for a more customize build, including track foundations which can be used to place a train car on, but it is important to use Train stop foundations, Riser foundations to create elevated grounds, edge foundations to blend in with the terrain around the Colony, Pond/Lake foundation blocks and so on.

The Train car foundations need a stop foundation block, this would allow the Train to stop when linked correctly, the way it works is, the player lays the Train stop foundation (The loading ramp area) in a zone, then player links that foundation to the zones Colony beacon, this will save the location data for the rail car.

Then what happens is, when the player is fully done building the track all cars are at their stops (each stop needs a car) whenever the player enters a train car, the other cars disable, then the players own train car that they are in will follow the track to the destination, reading the data of the Train stops until it finds the one that matches the players choice, the player gets off and for a brief moment as the player steps off, the car teleports back to where it is suppose to be at the same time all disabled cars come back.

This will allow the player to take a tour of their Colony.

____________

The buildings would be a mixed with Open and closed buildings, Open buildings having interiors in the same area as the exterior, Closed buildings having interiors in a separate space from the exterior, some will be a mix, this will allow the player to figure out what they want and optimize it.

Open building would be great for viewing locations while closed buildings would be like NPC homes.

Then you have mixtures that have Open lobbies but closed upper floors.

I see a Mix of different building types, from single small hut type to massive Highrise buildings.

For Apartments/Housing, The default would be NPC, but the player could go and assign it to a Crew member or themselves if they like it enough

For multifloored Highrise's that use elevators, in the ground floor manager office terminal, player could assign each floor to either Residential or Office.

If Residential, then all rooms are automatically assigned to NPC's, but a list of new tabs pop up with all the room numbers, allowing the player to assign them to Crew or themself, if Office, then another option pops up asking which company, and whoever the player chooses will fill that space.

There would be Factional Options, for buildings chosen for ""Office"", the player could assign a faction they belong to, this would make it a Branch office.

Each branch office would also assign the player to the manager office in the area, but at least all mission boards would be in the same area lol.

There would also be specialty buildings as well, like the Coffee building, Gal bank, Garden Biomes and Zoo's for the residents and guests (Colony ship Arboretum and Animal storage needed), Casino, fight pit and so on.

There would also be Industrial buildings, Manufacturing and processing buildings to create items like meds, gears, weapons and so on.

And a ton of different Storage facilities that the player can assign single resources and made items to (so they are sorted out)

_______________________________________

The Star Port would have Landing/Launch pads that contained Outpost Cargo link terminals so player can bring in (import) goods from the outposts and send out (export) made goods to the outposts.

A port authority building

A Import Storage

A Export storage.

A shipyard

A communications tower

A customs building and trade authority.

____________________________

The Government Buildings

The Main Government building would contain a terminal in the Leaders office that would be linked to all other buildings in the area for full control, this includes Closing and opening the Spaceport, marking things as contraband, power consumption, and so on.

Other department offices in the building will also have terminals, but only related items to their departments would be accessible, so it would be like the player sends an email down to the lower departments to make the changes.

There would also be a R&D department building in which the player can design ships for the Defense fleet, Uniforms for the Defense fleet, their weapons and gear.

Since all buildings are linked to the Main Government building, any related factory in the city will make the items and store them in the appropriate places if there is room available.

- Fleet Ships: Either Ship yard for deployment from planet if attacks come, or if Defense Space stations with station defense docks are available for already in space fleet (These will continuously fly around the planet but be assigned to a dock, unless instructed from government building terminal)

- Weapons, Gear, Clothing: the Security Depot


__________________

After the player makes the Spaceport, Government building and enough residential buildings, they can send word for Colonist to come and live.

Also the player can send word the place is open for tourism or closed from it as well.

Player can assign Crew to Leadership/Management positions, so in the Government Building, they can become department heads.

If a Crew member occupies a position, then if room is available NPC's who move into the colony will eventually appear and seem to start working under them, this includes Security personnel.

To make it seem a bit more realistic, could add in pathways and path markers that are color coordinated.

For example, say you chose the red path for Security to follow, you lay it out where you want them to walk, you also take the same colored markers and place them around the colony, the Markers when selected will give the player options, Guard, Observe for a bit of time before continuing walking and so on.

If the player sets up Guard, for security, that would be the 2 most important job, 1st being pilot, so wherever there is a guard posting, that will get filled, the rest of the security will follow the red pathway (Red path only seen in build mode). the other markers are just there for effects to make things seem more realistic, like a guard following the red pathway walking across an intersection, they would probably stop and look around before continuing across, but without the marker they would just walk.

But with the other colored pathways, the player could setup Maintenance, NPC preferred routes and so on.

I know this was a long post, I tried to not write it out so many times, but its been on my mind so much lately that I decided to just write it out and throw it out there.

I really do want a DLC like this, I even thought about making this a Mod myself, I could go into much much more detail, I mean a lot more, but this is probably my 100th time rewriting this.

I just think being able to create your own Colony and start a faction and spread that faction out would be pretty cool, start a Capital world and then expand throughout your system, using Outposts to bring in resources while sending out goods.

Giving your crew actual living spaces.

I do not see this as getting rid of Outposts, but instead complementing them as you would not be able to mine or anything within the colony, maybe use outpost manufacturing at most, but that is it.",8,1768822223.0,Starfield,3,1.0,False

I’ve attached POV videos of shot and steaming.

Setup

	•	Machine: Sage Bambino 

	•	Grinder: Sage Smart Grinder Pro

	•	Portafilter: bottomless

	•	Basket: stock double

	•	Puck screen: yes 

	•	Milk: usually Alpro Barista Oat or Oato (UK) OR skim milk  (with some semi-skim for fat content)

	•	Typical drinks: cortado, flat white

I’ve got experience on commercial machines in cafés, but at home I’m finding workflow, consistency and milk far more frustrating than expected.



**1. Workflow, dosing, puck prep, heating, efficiency**

Current approach

	•	Trying to single-dose with the Smart Grinder Pro 

	•	Dose: usually 16–17 g in

	•	Yield: ? 30-40g very roughly but often just go by how the shot looks and volume in the cup. 

	•	Shot time varies widely, but not paying too much attention to time.

I’m focusing more on grams out and taste rather than time, but:

	•	Retention + inconsistency on the Smart Grinder Pro is frustrating

	•	Workflow feels slow and clunky



Questions:

	•	Any practical tips to make the Smart Grinder Pro less painful for single dosing?

	•	RDT?

	•	For the Bambino specifically:

	•	Should I always run a blank shot to preheat the group + portafilter?

	•	Should I preheat my puck screen as well?

Tamping

	•	Should I simply tamp as hard and consistently as possible, full stop?

	•	Or is there any real benefit to moderating force on these baskets / this machine?

I currently tamp fairly hard and flat, but still occasionally get:

	•	Spraying on bottomless

	•	Slight channeling despite WDT

Puck screen

	•	Is it worth using on the Bambino long-term?

	•	Any downsides other than workflow friction?

	•	Should I always clean and dry between shots, or is a quick rinse fine?





**2. Milk, steam power, pitchers, and latte art frustration**

This is where most of my frustration lives 😅

Context

	•	Goal drinks: cortado / flat white size with proper microfoam and art

	•	Milk: Mostly oat barista (Alpro / Oato)

	•	Sometimes skim/semi-skim blend



On commercial machines I can pour decent art. 

At home on the Bambino:

	•	Steam feels weak and inconsistent

	•	Very hard to judge: how much air to add, when to stop stretching, how much final volume I should be aiming for

Often outcomes are: Too thin and flat, Or too bubbly and dry (Which usually ends in frustration and anger rather than enjoyment)

Pitcher size

	•	I own a 300 ml flat white pitcher

	•	In the attached video I sometimes use a very small \~150 ml pitcher

	•	With 300 ml, I waste a lot of milk for cortado / flat white

	•	With 150 ml, the steam wand positioning and vortex feel very unforgiving

Questions

	•	For Bambino users: Do you recommend sticking with small pitchers for small drinks, or always use 300 ml and accept wastage?

	•	Any Bambino-specific steaming technique tips?

	•	Is oat fundamentally limiting latte art potential here?

	•	Is skim + semi-skim blend making this harder than just using whole milk?

Honestly this part has been the biggest hit to enjoyment, because latte art + steaming is what I enjoy most about the process.



**3. “worth it?” cost/appreciating the quality of speciality beans crisis!**

[extraction](https://reddit.com/link/1qh1q6d/video/4ny2gh0ljaeg1/player)

[steaming](https://reddit.com/link/1qh1q6d/video/hlomfh0ljaeg1/player)

Context: I’ve invested quite a bit in the setup. I do enjoy the process when things go well, I have a rotating specialty subscription (Rave Coffee, UK)

But: I’m mainly drinking milk drinks, I have a sweet tooth and often add 2–3 sweeteners

I’m struggling to genuinely taste much difference between: good specialty beans and, slighty embarrassed about this but honestly,  instant coffee once milk + sweetener is involved

Which has led to a bit of a diminishing returns feeling 😕

Not saying there’s no difference with: smell, roast notes, complexity/nuance

All feel largely lost once: milk/oat milk and sweetener has been added?

**Questions:**

	Have others gone through a similar phase of doubting: specialty beans/milk drinks, workflow speed/difficulty?

At the moment I’m torn between: enjoying the process/craft and wondering if I’ve over-engineered something I can’t fully appreciate yet?



Final notes:

If any Bambino + Smart Grinder Pro users (or small-boiler / thermoblock users generally) have:

	•	workflow optimisations

	•	milk steaming / pitcher advice

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I wake up sore and bruised as I struggle to get out of bed to report for my kitchen duties.

I have always been the omega runt of our pack, which means I’m regularly bullied, beaten up, and tormented.

Omegas are the lowest rank in werewolf packs. 

When I caught the eye of our Alpha Sebastian, it felt like things were looking up. Then he chose Celest as his Luna instead of me.



I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I waltz down to his office, excited to see him. 

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, handsome,” I smile.

“You will address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘I told you he was an asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“The new Luna has found out about our past. It has been decided that you’re going to the Dark Howlers pack as a tribute.”

“I’m not a virgin. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Then you shouldn’t have thrown yourself at me,” he growls.

“You told me if I slept with you, you would make me your luna,” I whimper.

“Watch your mouth, Amelia. Your lies will get us both killed. Don’t be selfish and take me down with you,” Alpha Sebastian snarls.

“Please, Sebastian, I love you. Don’t send me away to be killed,” I plead.

For one moment, his demeanor changes, and his eyes light up at the sight of me.

He slides his hand over mine and leans forward.

Then his eyes glaze over, and he turns stone cold again, pulling away.

“Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says, scowling.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

“I’m sure we’ll be dead before the next blood moon,” I tell her.

‘It’s tomorrow. Stay alive long enough, and we can escape and find a pack that wants us.’

“If they knew what we are, no one would want us,” I tell Athena.

I was born with a cursed wolf. The healer covers me in painful markings to stop Athena from taking control of me, but the markings wear off and need to be constantly redrawn.

The power of the Blood Moon gives Athena a chance to break free of the runes so we can shift and run free.

My mood lifts with the chance of freedom.

I’m packing my bag when Luna Celest grabs me by the throat.

“You little slut. How dare you throw yourself at my husband? If I ever see you again, I’ll slit your throat,” she says, throwing me onto my floor.

I pull myself slowly up, feeling the pain shoot across my lower back from the impact. 

As soon as I get outside, some of the kids I went to high school with come to see me off, throwing rocks at me.

“You’re dead now. Obsidian will have your head,” they all yell and laugh.

‘John, Keith, and Maria are now added to my kill list,’ Athena declares.

I use my bag as a shield when a big black SUV pulls up, and one of the kids misses me and hits the vehicle.

A large, monstrous, attractive man steps out, grabs Keith by the throat, snaps his neck, and gestures for me to get in.

He throws Keith’s lifeless body on the ground.

“We are so dead,” I tell Athena.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19.” He plays with my hair, pulling my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh.” Is all I manage to get out.

“Why are you full of bruises, and what do these runes mean?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

It’s a two hour drive to Kaden’s pack. Every minute I get more paranoid that I’m going to die.

“There’s practically steam coming out of your ears, little wolf. Obsidian will not harm you,” he says.

He will once he finds out I’m not a virgin.

My chest starts to tighten, and I feel like I can’t catch my breath.

Kaden moves closer and tries rubbing my back, but I wince from the fresh injury. 

“Relax, little one,” he says, pouring me a glass of wine, and I gulp it back.

“Woah, slow down, Amelia,” he says, taking the glass away.

I’m practically squished up against the door, trying to stop him from touching me.

He notices and moves away.

“Amelia, what is going on? What are you not telling me?”

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin-length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don't answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man that you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say, avoiding the whole blood moon conversation.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

Trying to shut my brain down from overthinking.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” He asks.

“The healers draw them on. They think it keeps everyone safe from me,” I say.

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the blood moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don't want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘Your so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over you face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she's unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Why did you fucking kill my Luna?” he growls.

“She grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me,” I say.

“Fuck, I should have told her about you,” he barks.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“You said she grabbed you by the throat and threatened to kill you. Who was this girl?” Kaden asks.

“She’s been dealt with,” I mutter.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

I’m considering starting a business in Bhubaneswar and am confused between two ideas:

A kids’ indoor play zone (with  soft play, party space) which will be affordable and will have a kids drop-off facility (cctv live access) for few hours so that parents can relax

A tea/coffee franchise (small outlet)

Does anyone have any idea on - Which one has better demand and profit margins in Bhubaneswar? 

Note: I will be quitting my job to pursue this as I am overworked and have anxiety issues as well.

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I wake up sore and bruised as I struggle to get out of bed to report for my kitchen duties.

I have always been the omega runt of our pack, which means I’m regularly bullied, beaten up, and tormented.

Omegas are the lowest rank in werewolf packs. 

When I caught the eye of our Alpha Sebastian, it felt like things were looking up. Then he chose Celest as his Luna instead of me.



I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I waltz down to his office, excited to see him. 

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, handsome,” I smile.

“You will address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘I told you he was an asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“The new Luna has found out about our past. It has been decided that you’re going to the Dark Howlers pack as a tribute.”

“I’m not a virgin. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Then you shouldn’t have thrown yourself at me,” he growls.

“You told me if I slept with you, you would make me your luna,” I whimper.

“Watch your mouth, Amelia. Your lies will get us both killed. Don’t be selfish and take me down with you,” Alpha Sebastian snarls.

“Please, Sebastian, I love you. Don’t send me away to be killed,” I plead.

For one moment, his demeanor changes, and his eyes light up at the sight of me.

He slides his hand over mine and leans forward.

Then his eyes glaze over, and he turns stone cold again, pulling away.

“Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says, scowling.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

“I’m sure we’ll be dead before the next blood moon,” I tell her.

‘It’s tomorrow. Stay alive long enough, and we can escape and find a pack that wants us.’

“If they knew what we are, no one would want us,” I tell Athena.

I was born with a cursed wolf. The healer covers me in painful markings to stop Athena from taking control of me, but the markings wear off and need to be constantly redrawn.

The power of the Blood Moon gives Athena a chance to break free of the runes so we can shift and run free.

My mood lifts with the chance of freedom.

I’m packing my bag when Luna Celest grabs me by the throat.

“You little slut. How dare you throw yourself at my husband? If I ever see you again, I’ll slit your throat,” she says, throwing me onto my floor.

I pull myself slowly up, feeling the pain shoot across my lower back from the impact. 

As soon as I get outside, some of the kids I went to high school with come to see me off, throwing rocks at me.

“You’re dead now. Obsidian will have your head,” they all yell and laugh.

‘John, Keith, and Maria are now added to my kill list,’ Athena declares.

I use my bag as a shield when a big black SUV pulls up, and one of the kids misses me and hits the vehicle.

A large, monstrous, attractive man steps out, grabs Keith by the throat, snaps his neck, and gestures for me to get in.

He throws Keith’s lifeless body on the ground.

“We are so dead,” I tell Athena.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19.” He plays with my hair, pulling my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh.” Is all I manage to get out.

“Why are you full of bruises, and what do these runes mean?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

It’s a two hour drive to Kaden’s pack. Every minute I get more paranoid that I’m going to die.

“There’s practically steam coming out of your ears, little wolf. Obsidian will not harm you,” he says.

He will once he finds out I’m not a virgin.

My chest starts to tighten, and I feel like I can’t catch my breath.

Kaden moves closer and tries rubbing my back, but I wince from the fresh injury. 

“Relax, little one,” he says, pouring me a glass of wine, and I gulp it back.

“Woah, slow down, Amelia,” he says, taking the glass away.

I’m practically squished up against the door, trying to stop him from touching me.

He notices and moves away.

“Amelia, what is going on? What are you not telling me?”

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin-length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don't answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man that you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say, avoiding the whole blood moon conversation.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

Trying to shut my brain down from overthinking.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” He asks.

“The healers draw them on. They think it keeps everyone safe from me,” I say.

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don't want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

‘Your so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over you face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Why did you fucking kill my Luna?” he growls.

“She grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me,” I say.

“Fuck, I should have told her about you,” he barks.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“You said she grabbed you by the throat and threatened to kill you. Who was this girl?” Kaden asks.

“She’s been dealt with,” I mutter.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Overall the relationship is good, we communicate well and don’t really have big fights.

She has a very social personality and makes friends easily, including a lot of guy friends. I’ve never told her she can’t have male friends and I genuinely don’t want to be that person.

Recently she became close with a guy from her gym. They train together sometimes, text fairly often, and occasionally grab coffee after workouts.

I didn’t say anything at first because nothing seemed *objectively* wrong. But over time I realised it was bothering me more than I expected.

What complicates things is that she’s very open about it. She doesn’t hide her phone, she tells me when they hang out, and she’s never given me a reason not to trust her.

When I finally brought it up, I didn’t ask her to stop seeing him. I just said it makes me uncomfortable and I’m trying to understand why.

She said she feels like in modern relationships, opposite-sex friendships should be normal and not automatically treated as a threat. She also said she doesn’t want to limit herself because of someone else’s insecurity.

I understand that, and part of me agrees with her. Another part of me feels like I’m constantly having to override my instincts to be “chill” and progressive.

I don’t want to control her, but I also don’t want to ignore my feelings just to seem emotionally evolved.

Is this something I need to work through on my own, or is it fair to expect some boundaries even if nothing inappropriate is happening?

[Some 92&#37; of the world’s rare-earth magnets come from China.© Katie Hayes Luke for WSJ](https://preview.redd.it/xhx3d2y9eaeg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a324c3dfed5fe6c5688f5b9d02477a9a45fd0878)

Texas rare-earth magnet maker Noveon Magnetics has raised $215 million from investors as the U.S. pushes to develop domestic sources of a vital electronics component that China, the world’s largest supplier, has under a chokehold.

One of the few U\*\*.\*\*S. rare-earth magnet makers, Noveon is riding a wave of urgency stemming from a U.S. trade war with China that has put once-obscure critical minerals into sharp focus. The San Marcos, Texas-based company, started in 2014, began delivering magnets only in the past two years and is now vying to supply the array of American industries that need magnets.

[Rare-Earth Magnet Maker Raises $215 Million to Amp Up U.S. Supply](https://preview.redd.it/tl1ild5deaeg1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e07019ae5851c326be77d7cc1ba9351935f9bfe)

The raise—which is roughly double all of Noveon’s prior venture-capital funding—comes mostly from One Investment Management, the investment firm of Rajeev Misra, the former long-running leader of SoftBank Group’s mammoth Vision Fund. The firm put in $200 million, and the remaining $15 million comes from existing investors, said Noveon Chief Executive Scott Dunn, who declined to provide the company’s valuation. With the investment, One Investment Management becomes the largest shareholder and gets two board seats.

Last year, venture capitalists invested $630 million in U.S. critical-mineral startups, the highest level recorded, according to data provider PitchBook.

Beijing in April countered Washington’s tariffs [with export controls on rare earths](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-flexes-chokehold-on-rare-earth-magnets-as-exports-plunge-in-may-c1adac50), including those used to make the magnets required for missile defense systems, submarines, data centers, jet fighters, drones and electric vehicles. The new measures required Chinese exporters of certain crucial rare earths to first apply for permission, giving Beijing the ability to hold up or block sales.

The restrictions fell [like a hammer on U.S. industries](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51): Exports plunged, and companies were forced to pause production, delay sales and scramble for alternative sources, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

It was a manufactured crisis that Dunn had predicted over a decade ago while working inside China’s magnet-making businesses. He and his co-founder spent a few years in factories across China—which supplies 92% of the world’s rare-earth magnets—to learn the trade and study the supply chain.

“You just have to go where something is if you really want to be serious about it,” Dunn said. “This industry really is a case of all roads lead to China.”

[Noveon Magnetics is seeking to supply rare-earth magnets to U.S. industries.© Katie Hayes Luke for WSJ](https://preview.redd.it/smg0m7oheaeg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d44eec94cc0299b28417255c03502d70589de00)

Noveon became the first company to reshore full-scale magnet-making in the U.S. It spent several more years building a factory, hiring and training a workforce, and trying to convince customers to buy Noveon’s magnets, not China’s. It gets rare earths from Australia, partners with a refiner in Europe and has developed a process for sintering, molding and finishing the magnets.

“It is really complicated, it is really capital intensive, it is not easy to course-correct,” Dunn said\*\*.\*\* Sourcing all of his materials from outside China meant paying a premium. “You have to wonder if the thing you are doing makes sense,” he said. Noveon has received almost $40 million in federal grants from prior administrations, including [pandemic-era funding](https://www.wsj.com/business/china-rare-earth-magnets-us-production-782677e5).

The current Trump administration has underscored the importance of American-made magnets with $6**7**0 million in loans and equity investment to North Carolina-based rare-earths magnet startup Vulcan Elements and another $80 million for Indiana-based ReElement Technologies, which recycles rare-earth elements. The [Pentagon took a 15% stake](https://www.wsj.com/business/mp-materials-enters-multibillion-dollar-partnership-with-defense-dept-c8f9f806) in rare-earths mining company MP Materials, which is building a new magnet factory in Texas.

A group of lawmakers last week proposed a $2.5 billion reserve to stockpile supplies of critical minerals, including rare earths such as those used in magnets.

“It is like ‘operation landing on the moon’ in the Kennedy days,” said Misra. “It has that sense of urgency in Washington.”

His firm also backed Vulcan Elements, believing “the U.S. needs three or four magnet makers,” Misra said. “The U.S. is doing a catch-up here.” He said his firm has made several other investments in the magnet supply chain that it will announce over the next four months.

The Vision Fund, under Misra’s leadership, often [invested heavily in direct competitors](https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-is-funding-every-side-of-latin-americas-bruising-startup-battle-11580398900) in the same sector, the Journal has reported.

Dunn said Noveon is on track to produce more than 2,000 tons of magnets a year, about 5% of the current U.S. demand. China can produce about 400,000 tons a year, at least 40% more than total global demand.

Noveon’s customers include General Motors. It recently announced a deal to build a factory in South Korea and partner with LG Electronics on recycling end-of-life electronic materials and creating new magnets from them.

**Vancouver, British Columbia / January 19, 2026 / Apex Critical Metals Corp.** (CSE: APXC) (OTCQX: APXCF) (FWB: KL9) (“Apex” or the “Company”) a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on the identification and development of critical and strategic metals, is pleased to provide a year-end summary of its 2025 activities and milestones at the Rift Rare Earth Project (the “Project”, or “Rift”), along with a 2026 outlook including a more detailed summary of the upcoming Phase I drill campaign.

Throughout 2025, Apex accumulated and expanded its private holdings within the Elk Creek Carbonatite complex with a focus on the most prospective ground for rare earth (REE) and niobium mineralization, and completed comprehensive technical and modeling work, enabled by the multiple strategic financings completed during the year.

**Rift Rare Earth Project: A Transformative Year Summarized**

* **After evaluating numerous known global carbonatites** the Company identified **Elk Creek as its highest priority** and by September 3, 2025, had secured 2,407 acres.
* **Project size subsequently expanded to 3,500 acres** including key consolidation pieces **incorporating the most significant historical REE intersections** from previous drilling.
* **Apex launched and completed a re-logging and re-assaying program** of preserved drill core from the Rift Project during Q4/2025 in partnership with the Conservation and Survey Division, School of Natural Resources, University of Nebraska–Lincoln (see news releases November 24th and December 8th).
* **Received approval** from the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment (NDEE) **for its mineral exploration/drill permit** (see news release Jan 5, 2026).
* **Secured drill contractor with extensive local drilling experience** in the Elk Creek Carbonatite (Boart Longyear) for Phase I drilling (see news release Jan 12, 2026).

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[NioCorp has the Critical Minerals needed to build the \\""STUFF\\"" of tomorrow!...](https://reddit.com/link/1qh1ir9/video/iwepwyeygaeg1/player)

IMHO\~ The two developments today underscore just how fast the critical minerals and magnet supply chain is being pulled forward by policy and capital. Noveon Magnetics just raised **$215 million** to scale U.S.-based rare-earth magnet production, ***while Apex Critical Metals is only now beginning early-stage drilling around the Elk Creek carbonatite — ground that NioCorp has already spent years characterizing, permitting, engineering, and advancing toward development.*** The contrast is stark. Apex is still proving what it might have. NioCorp is on the verge of proving how its project gets financed and built!

What makes NioCorp different at this moment isn’t just geology — it’s positioning. Elk Creek is not a single-commodity story. It’s Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and rare earths from one of the most advanced carbonatite projects in North America, backed by completed metallurgy, a defined flowsheet, federal engagement, and now a pending updated DFS. ***While others are still drilling, re-logging core, or pitching exploration upside,*** NioCorp is transitioning into the phase where banks, EXIM, and strategic partners can finally underwrite the asset. That’s the inflection point where projects stop being “stories” and start being financeable infrastructure.

The Noveon raise proves something else important: capital is now flowing aggressively into downstream magnet capacity, recycling, **and domestic supply chains — because Washington views this as national security.** That creates a powerful pull-through effect. Magnet makers, defense primes, and industrial partners need reliable upstream feedstock. **NioCorp’s Elk Creek project uniquely fits that need: a potential long-term domestic source of scandium (for Al-Sc aerospace alloys), REEs (NdPr, Dy, Tb for magnets), titanium products, and niobium — all aligned with defense, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing. That’s not speculative hype; those relationships already exist at the technical and institutional level.**

# What’s been missing is the DFS keystone.

**That’s why “2026 is the year” isn’t marketing fluff — it’s structural reality.** The remaining assays are out. Site work is visibly underway. **The updated DFS is imminent.** Pentagon-linked scandium milestones are expected in parallel this Feb. 2026! Offtakes, anchor investors, and EXIM-linked financing logically follow the technical validation, not precede it. **The market almost always waits too long to re-rate projects like this, but once the DFS lands, the risk profile changes rapidly: from existential to executional!**

**Bottom line:** While others are racing to catch up to the opportunity, NioCorp is positioned to convert years of work into a buildable, financeable, strategically essential asset. In a world where magnet makers are raising hundreds of millions and governments are reshaping supply chains around security, Elk Creek looks less like a junior miner and more like future infrastructure. If 2025 was about preparation, **2026 is about conversion** — and the rerating that follows is rarely gentle.

This is why **EXIM, the DoD, and Tier-1 defense primes are in deep discussions right now**. They aren’t looking for another single-metal supplier — they need a **fully domestic, vertically integrated materials platform**.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

I've recently got myself 2 Bialetti Moka pots! I have a 3 Cup and a 1 Cup model.

I'm new to this style of brewing and have been really enjoying it! But I am curious about the amount of caffeine in my go to coffees. 

This is coming from someone who was a teaspoon of instant coffee Americano kind of guy, so has been uncharted territory for me filling up the funnel with coffee grounds.

My initial thinking with the 2 purchases was to have a 1 cup for personal use, and a 3 cup for shared use when me and my partner are home together. However, I have recently worked up to using the 3 cup for just myself for my morning Americano. 

The main reason for this post it to see if someone can give me a rough idea of the caffeine content I'm consuming. With the 3 cup, I am currently using around 10-15g of 'medium-strong dark roast' coffee grounds. Then I dilute a with a small amount of water.

I moved to the UK a couple of years ago to live with my partner and have found it surprisingly hard to make friends locally that are my age - Newbury isn't really a student town/young people around so it's been tough lol. I thought I'd try here! 

  
I've been playing DnD for like 5 years at this point, both as a DM and PC on 5e but open to learning new systems. I'm not necessarily looking to jump straight into a campaign, more just hoping to meet like-minded people to chat and hang out, if a campaign comes out of it at some point then that's a big win too lol, 

  
A bit about me: I'm Irish, I do a lot of art and drawing (I do commissions occasionally and yes, it's a lot of DnD art) and I game quite a bit (Apex Legends, Baldurs Gate, Minecraft, etc, anything desktop!) I work full-time in IT and study part-time. Music-wise, I listen to anything and play guitar but punk rock and rap are probably my top two? Random combo, I know lmao. 

  
I live with my partner and our cat, Dexter. We've got our own place and a car so travelling/giving lifts ain't an issue!

  
If anyones local and fancies grabbing a coffee or some drinks, running some games on Discord or even just looking for a DnD group, feel free to message me or pop a comment!

I started a course a while back and leaned hard into a few hobbies, and together they’ve helped me shift the focus back to myself and my kids instead of just surviving day to day.

I’m not magically healed or suddenly a zen master. I still lose my phone while holding it and consider cereal a solid dinner option some nights. But mentally I’m healthier, more present with my kid, and way less reactive than I was before.

The course gave me practical tools, and my hobbies gave my brain somewhere else to go besides overthinking everything at 2 a.m. I’m learning how to set boundaries without feeling like a terrible person and how to take care of myself without drowning in guilt.

My kid seems lighter too. More laughs, calmer mornings, and fewer tense moments. Seeing that change has meant everything.

Some days are still rough, but now I notice the progress. Small wins matter. Getting through the week counts. Laughing with your kid after a hard day definitely counts.

1qh19uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/comments/1qh19uq/is_this_still_ocd_or_am_i_just_exaggerating_12/,"Is this still OCD or am I just exaggerating? 12 years of OCD, now mostly rumination, health anxiety & perfectionism","I want to share my story and also ask something that I keep doubting myself about:  
*Is this really OCD, or am I just exaggerating / being weak?*

I’ve had OCD since I was about 12 years old. For 12 years, I managed to hide it almost completely. Only two people knew. Until two weeks ago, this was my biggest secret.

# Phase 1 – Classic checking OCD (around age 12–16)

It started with very typical checking compulsions around safety:

* Checking freezer, fridge, microwave, oven (clock/light)
* Checking taps (kitchen, storage room)
* Checking sockets (coffee machine, kettle)
* Checking lights
* Checking my room upstairs: lights, water near my laptop, sockets, etc.

I had two routines:

* Morning checks before leaving for school (often making me late)
* Evening checks before sleeping — which eventually grew from 10 minutes to up to 4 hours, going back out of bed multiple times to recheck

At some point, my mom and I even had a “code word” so my brain could accept that things were “safe”.

# Phase 2 – People & reassurance (around age 17)

Later, the OCD shifted to people.

I constantly feared that others were angry, disappointed, or upset with me. I tried to “check” this by:

* Replaying conversations endlessly
* Looking for reassurance in how people talked, laughed, messaged
* Sometimes sending messages just to trigger a response
* Panicking when someone read a message but didn’t reply immediately

I also became a heavy people-pleaser and ignored my own needs.

# Phase 3 – Health anxiety & rumination (last 2 years)

About two years ago, everything shifted to health/medical OCD.

It started after a blood test showed slightly elevated pancreas values. Nothing severe, but it triggered something deep.

From that point on:

* Constant body checking (pressing my abdomen, feeling, moving)
* Googling symptoms
* Weeks of rumination before going to the doctor
* Medical fears that felt 100% real, not “just thoughts”

Some of the fears I fully believed at different times:

* Pancreatic cancer (multiple times)
* Muscle pain everywhere
* Throat lesions
* Eye issues (chalazion, lumps)
* Bowel changes
* Frequent urination
* Being underweight = cancer

This led to:

* 8 blood tests
* 2 abdominal ultrasounds
* 1 neck ultrasound
* Specialist visits
* Stool tests
* Colonoscopy (which caused extreme stress and compulsions)

# Where I am now – doubt, rumination & perfectionism

Here’s where my big doubt comes in.

The compulsions are less “visible” now.  
It’s mostly mental rumination, reassurance seeking, overanalyzing sensations, and doubting myself.

And that makes me think:

>What if this isn’t OCD anymore? What if I’m just exaggerating?

I also notice:

* Extreme perfectionism (“If I can’t do it perfectly, I don’t want to do it”)
* Fear of new things
* Example: skiing — my girlfriend skis and invited me. I get anxious and even irritated when people say “you’ll learn it, it’ll be fine”.
* I want to be good immediately, or not do it at all

Now that I’m home (my doctor put me on sick leave), I keep trying to connect everything:

* OCD
* rumination
* health anxiety
* perfectionism
* fear of failure

I’m trying to find a “red thread” — and I don’t know if that search itself is part of the OCD.

# Why I finally spoke up

Two weeks ago, I told my GP and my boss.  
That conversation was incredibly hard.

It had become too much:

* I stopped enjoying things
* At work I was constantly ruminating
* Some days I could only log 3 hours of work out of 8
* My girlfriend told me the emotional support had become too heavy and I needed help

I’m now on sertraline (1.5 weeks).  
Ironically, after my colonoscopy ruled out another fear, my symptoms eased — which again makes me doubt myself.

>If it’s better now… was it ever “that bad”?

# Final thought

I guess I’m posting because:

* I doubt my own suffering
* I fear I’m “making it bigger than it is”
* And I want to know if others with OCD recognize this evolution into rumination, perfectionism and fear of new things

This time it was her frustration about how she wanted us to join her goodbye dinner as a whole family for her brother’s wife. She says that the tradition is to go as a whole family and not like separate couples. The family is viewed as one unit, and it’s respectful to come as one, not individually. This goes the same for when visiting for a family member’s birthday, a dinner. It is the family that’s invited, not the couple. 

She said she do doesn’t care how it happens in my family, how my siblings do this and that each has their own culture; that I knew ‘how things are done’ in her family before marrying her son. By marrying her son, I joined his family, this is my ‘new family’ and it comes with its expectations/traditions etc.

Shes previously hinted as naming our child when it comes to that because its tradition.. and changing my name to a more religious one. She still has me named as her ideal name on her phone.

 Prior to getting married she once told me if I wear the wedding dress I choose, she would not invite her family because it’s embarrassing. 

She’d want us to do mother daughter things, go out on coffee dates together etc and build relationship outside of her husband, communicate directly to her not through him etc 

She also wants to teach us how things are done so we can pass the traditions on.

For more context, prior to this, she had expectations of being a dutiful daughter in law, who organises things - the social glue. To dress traditionally around the house + when visiting her family. (While keeping an eye and commenting on my clothing if I’m not modest enough) accompany her shopping, doctor’s appointments, running errands etc. This is what her daughters do and essentially she gained me as a new daughter. At the moment we live with them, so dinners were expected to be eaten together during the week, breakfast together every weekend. On top of this, going out with the whole family every weekend + visiting extended family once a week. I work full time + some weekends so the very little time I have left, I want to either spend alone to recharge or with my husband to maintain our relationship.

Since then, we have slowly placed our boundaries and I simply didn’t follow expectations I found unreasonable. I became more reserved and protective with my time and identity. Had dinners together some days a week, dinner and breakfast dates outside of the house, saying no to most of the family events they hold. I let my husband go as he pleases to his family’s events and I only join sometimes.

when I started placing boundaries, they felt like I didn’t integrate into the family, that their relationship with their son is more distant as they don’t do things together as they used to. In my view this is a natural consequence of getting married.

She has since come to reason with me and said she has let things go and understands I don’t want to join her on every errand, every event, every dinner etc. She understands that I work full time and are more reserved as a character. But just wants effort, a close relationship and traditions passed on.

Hubby and I argued so much to make it happen, and now that 75% of them are gone, I’m like… relieved but angry. why were my requests so unreasonable and taboo when I first asked for them. It’s soured my view of MIL and everyone’s asking me to look past it and move forward and she keeps asking to have a close relationship.

TDLR: MIL expects full and adherence to her family tradition, placing multiple expectations as how I should be as a DIL. From clothing, to family event planning, dinners together every day, family outings every week. I remained firm in my boundaries and while expectations have reduced, she still wants a closer relationship together and more integration.",10,1768820172.0,AITAH,17,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're just *going through the motions*? Like there's more juice to squeeze out of each day, but you're not quite sure how? That's what this post is all about – unlocking those hidden levels of optimization and boosting our overall well-being.

Think of it less as a rigid checklist and more as a buffet of awesome ideas to sprinkle into your life. What works for one might spark a whole new idea for another.

*   **Micro-habits that pack a punch.** Instead of aiming for giant leaps, what if we focused on tiny, almost effortless actions? Think: drinking a glass of water before coffee, doing 5 push-ups while the kettle boils, or taking 60 seconds to stretch when you feel a slump coming on. These little wins build momentum and feel way less daunting.
*   **Mindful transitions.** We rush from one thing to the next, right? What if we intentionally created short buffers? A minute of deep breathing between calls, a quick walk around the block after finishing a task, or even just consciously noticing the sights and sounds on your commute. These moments help us reset and approach the next thing with more presence.
*   **Decluttering your digital space.** Our phones and computers can be huge energy drains. Regularly tidying up your desktop, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, or even just scheduling ""digital detox"" blocks can free up mental bandwidth.
*   **Fueling your focus.** It's easy to grab whatever's convenient, but paying a little more attention to what we eat and drink can have a surprisingly big impact on our energy levels and mental clarity. Even small, intentional choices can make a difference.
*   **Prioritizing genuine connection.** In our busy lives, it’s easy to let relationships slide. Scheduling dedicated time for meaningful conversations, even if it’s just a quick call with a friend, can be incredibly rejuvenating.

1qh1415,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qh1415/next_upgrade_from_bean_to_cup_machine_750/,Next upgrade from bean to cup machine? [£750],"Over the last few years I have been steadily upgrading my home coffee setup as my disposable income has increased, starting from a crappy pod machine going to a higher end Nespresso machine before realising that pod coffee has its inherit limitations. I currently have a Delonghi Magnifica Evo and I'm fairly happy with the results (compared to pod machines at least) but it's still not as good as what you would get from a coffee shop.

So I've been looking at what the next natural upgrade would be, but the amount of different machines available and different levels of automation seems overwhelming to me, as does the overall process and accessories available. I quite like the idea of having more manual input/control over the espresso making process, but I also don't really see this becoming a hobby the way it is for some people, spending a long time dialling every variable in. While I'm happy to learn the basics at the end of the day I just want to have the best quality espresso I can at home with the minimal (but not necessarily zero) level of fuss/time commitment. This includes the milk steaming process as I have no idea where to begin with that, and would prefer the machine to do it for me. 

I drink espresso, americano, flat whites and lattes mainly it depends what mood I'm in, so I'd be looking for a machine that can do all of those. I'd prefer an all in one machine for ease of use but from what I've read the grinders on them aren't always the best? How much would I have to spend to get one with a decent grinder?

I'd like to keep my budget below £750 but could be swayed to go a higher if it would be worth spending the extra money. Is there anything that fits the bill for what I'm looking for? Or am I better just sticking with what I have? ",0,1768820021.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

Obviously, gen 3 never had any boys, so trying to get them a bit boy coded was my initial struggle, but i took a little bit of reference from the gen 1 boys (sharper jawlines) and a few minor detail tweaks here and there... I'm reasonably happy with how they turned out!

Once again it's time for some pony rambles that you are in no way obligated to read!

Blitz was one of my earlier ponies along with Minty Swirl and Milkyway, you've probably seen him briefly before in Lilac Sunrise's piece(assuming you've seen my girls first, of coarse). His dark past is the he was once a ship pony haha, one of two I've ever created. he lost his ship pony status and had a redesign around... I want to say 2018? he's my boy really, I've always shipped him with Milkyway, even when he was still a ship pony.

Silverfox was actually named by one of my friends lol, he's the dad of Milkyway and Milo. about two years after the introduction of Coffee Liqueur into my line up they went from bbfs to bfs, because that's just what my brain does idk what to tell you. Have never drawn his (ex)wife, there's pieces where she's vaguely referenced/eluded to, but otherwise yea, I created Silver to give Milkyway and Milo a dad, but never found the motivation to ever design their mother... and now he has a bf so she's probably never gonna get an actual design lmao.

Coffee Liqueur, simplified his (leg)markings for this piece cause I've lived in regret since his creation quite frankly lol. one of my ponies based off a cocktail, he's part zebra. cutie mark is scarred over on both sides, but I wont get into too much lore here lol. he's my broody mans and drawing him with the gen 3 perpetual smile was almost off putting to me.

Storm Chaser, one of my... lesser fleshed out ponies, he at least has a cutie mark though lol. Another of my first ponies, however I've only drawn him a total of (now)4 times in over a decade. He does always get drawn looking like a bit of an overconfident menace though so that's something.

Milo, Milkyway's older brother. It took me drawing this piece to realise in 95% of art I have of him I've positioned him and/or his wings to block his flank so I never created a cutiemark for him... after this project the next is getting everyone their dang cutiemarks I guess

Asmodeus, my dragon pony! I don't look to hard into the fact I have both a dragon pony AND a dragon dog... It's easier not to question it. brother or alternate universe version to my girl Astarte, also a redesign of one of my first ponies Demon.

Curacao Cream, another cocktail based pony, usually has sunglasses but I didn't feel like adding them, I tried to give him his curls, this little project has at the very least shown me why gen 3 all had the simple, similar hairstyles.

Solar Splash, an earlier pony who got a redesign, however, he honestly didn't change too much from his original design. Solar is actually trans, so I tried to give him just a slightly softer look, while still keeping him obviously a part of the boys.

Rainbow Rift, twin brother of Solar Splash, Rift actually changed massively in his redesign compared to Solar. he does have a cutiemark, its just both Rift and Solar only have a cutiemark on the one side... I actually am fairly sure I drew him back to front(Left side is actually his right side) but if I drew the other side he would instead not have an iris, so I decided that was more important! I'll not get too deep into their lore, but just know that the twins are my glitchy bbys.

Last but not least, Sake Fizz, Zevias twin brother. another Kirin/pony(obviously) much more mild tempered than his sister. Also another of the cocktail ponies, he's a bartender. a rather dynamic pose for one of my laziest lads lol

This morning after a couple of cups of coffee I really started to have an urge to pee, but I trusted that I could hold it in until I've finished my morning route and then drive to the nearest public toilet. After doing so I drove to a local mall hoping to find a public toilet there. This is when I understood I won't have much time left to make it there.

I rush inside the mall, find the toilet and notice I'll have to pay with my phone to gain an access there. Damn it, I think to myself and grab my phone while walking around in circles because the need to pee was reaching a critical level. After paying I run inside and get into the nearest stall. I close the door and just as I am about to unbuckle my pants, it happened. Just the sight of the toilet seat was enough for me to lose control of my bladder and I peed a little in my pants. Thankfully I managed to aim like 90% to the toilet but the remaining 10% in my pants was obviously too much. I'd still have to change them.

I cleaned as much as I could with toilet paper alone and flushed the toilet. Just after washing my hands I received a call from my boss. He sounded urgent and told me that due to a scheduling mistake there is one teen who has to be picked up immediately and drive to school. I just stared at my mortified face in the mirror alongside the little puddle in my pants. It wasn't exactly a situation I could explain to my boss so I just said 'alright', cursed my life and everything and walked to the car with a tissue I placed on the car seat between my legs. Thankfully the puddle in my pants wasn't too noticeable while sitting and I am sure it smelled but hopefully not too much. There wasn't really anything else I could do in that super humiliating situation.

Wouldn't you think there was already enough for one person to bear? Of course not! Because when you're already having a miserable time the difficulty levels will have to multiply. Always.

I had received earlier a scheduled ride offer I could've conveniently pick up after my morning school route, but I obviously couldn't do that in this horrible situation. The only way to cancel the ride and send it to another cab is to call the dispatch center, which I did with the reason in my mind being 'an unpredictable and urgent health reason'. I called them and had to wait for them to answer for minutes and minutes! During this time I had driven the one kid to school and almost were at home when it was already like ten minutes over the scheduled pick up time. They never answered my call so I tried to call the customer to profusely apologize that I cannot make it there but they were presumably trying to call the dispatch center as well wondering where the hell their cab is. I had made it home when I received a notification in the ride app that it has been cancelled.

At home I cleaned myself, changed my pants, then cleaned the car seat and nearly cried because I felt so mortified and embarrassed about getting into this situation. I am pretty sure I have an UTI because of other urinary symptoms I have having lately and will have to see a doctor about it. Nothing could've prepared me to what I experienced other than the symptoms that I should've taken more seriously and drink less coffee before heading to work.

TL;DR: I drank too much coffee and peed in my pants at my work as a taxi driver. Couldn't immediately do anything about it and had to endure having to serve one customer before I got to go home and clean up.",0,1768819232.0,tifu,9,0.39,False

I've recently taken delivery of a ECAM 250.33 TB and I'm struggling with the ""LONG"" coffee function.

With my previous ECAM 23.120.B the ""Long"" function would deliver a large mug of coffee as expected. Now that I've replaced it with an ECAM 250.33 TB it only fills half a mug - in fact it delivers less than the adjacent ""Coffee"" (large cup) function.

I have tried to adjust the dispense amount using the normal technique (press and hold until the button flashes, release, then press when sufficient coffee is dispensed), and I can get the machine to increase the number of pulses, but it also stops doing the second grind.

So before adjustment:

* Grind beans
* 6 x pulses
* Grind Beans
* 6 x pulses

= half a mug

After adjustment:

* Grind beans
* 12 x pulses

= also half a mug, but weaker.

What I want:

* Grind beans
* 12 x pulses

At one party we talked a bit more than usual and in the end she hugged me and I thougt that was different to the usual friendship hug.
Two weeks later we celebrated new years eve together, and I talked to one of her friends, and aparantly she said to her that there are flirty vibes between us. After hearing that I danced with her talked with her and in the end I brought her to the bus and while we waited she laid her head on my shoulder. (I didn't make a move that night because I was wasted!) 
So again two weeks later we went to a bar again with a few friends but the dynamic was different. We didn't talk a lot and there were no vibes. Still I asked her out on a coffee and she said yes and went home. Later that evening I got a message that she would love to get a coffee with me but that would only be on a friendship basis.
And if I wanted we could talk about it... I said that's OK we're still gonna grab a coffee. Two days later we got the coffee and sat in the Cafe for like 3 hours, but we didn't talk about the friendship thing.
Then we took a walk through the city. And when we said goodbye there was this hug again. Her arms around my neck (even though she's way smaller that I am) my arms around her waist. 
And now in freaking confused. Because she was so cute on new years then she tells me only friendship and then she is cute again?

If anybody can tell me how I should behave now that would be great. Im taking two weeks vacation now and she told me to send her pictures.

My favorite part of the day is right now, and I'm not enjoying it.

---

I was walking on an empty rural road in Italy, way early in the morning. Alone with a cup of coffee. Vanilla skies were just popping up in the distance. Everything was so fucking calm and still. 

And beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

I remember not wanting the moment to end. 

--

I drink from an espresso cup now, didn't before. It's a message to myself that things change. 

Things eventually change.

Silence from the universe it was. Of course it was.

Try to do something today that makes you happy. Regardless of how small it is. Go for it.

I've been working on my diet for the past week and I've quickly noticed something that's probably been throwing me off for a long time.

I've always thought about how I really don't eat much at all, my appetite only allows me one meal some days yet my weight stays on. It always frustrated me. Well this morning my craving for a delicious sweet latte was strong, I probably drink a sugar loaded calorie dense latte 3 times a week. For some reason it didn't click in my brain until I decided to try out a new coffee place that listed the calories unlike my usual shop. 

My issue losing weight is not going to be the food, but kicking this calorie bomb drink habit to the side. That said, I'm not ready to give it all up completely so I figured I'd post here and see if anyone can recommend your best alternatives that still manage to feel a little indulgent while not taking up a quarter of your daily alloted calories.

 Coffee shop doesn't matter too much of you want to share a specific drink, I'll do my best to get as close as I can with my local shops and homemade recipes are great too since I make a lot of coffee at home as well. 

Thank you!! 💚🤟",1,1768818745.0,caloriecount,5,1.0,False
