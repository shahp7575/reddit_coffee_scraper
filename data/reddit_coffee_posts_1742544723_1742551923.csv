1jgddm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1jgddm1/constipation_worse_after_course_of_allicin_imo/,Constipation worse after course of allicin ? IMO. Don't even get the urge. What's causing it? Help 😭,"Have done a couple of protocols with oregano etc then the allicin/berberine etc. 
Currently taking l-reuteri and s.boulardi plus b1 & zinc, (plus 5htp, fexofenadine and quercitin I've been taking daily for a while due to allergies and other issues). 

Prior to stopping the allicin I was going to the toilet maybe every 1-2 days without any help but did try some motility tablets to help it move faster. It seemed to help but not a massive difference (just to my pocket!)..
I drink lots of water and only have one coffee in the morning. I eat plenty of veg and healthy meals (sugar cravings stopped after the allicin course). 

But now, I've not got chronic constipation and it can be days and I don't even have the urge to go which is even more worrying! 😢

I tried
- prebio sun fibre -.nada (previously, even 1/4tspn would give me diarrhea!)
-Dulcolax ease with lots of water - nada
-natural dates - nada.

Then after having multiple thrombosed piles from a bad constipation, I started trying some dulcolax liquid laxative (lactose free). Started with one teaspoon a night (dose it 1-2) but on the third day I ended up having 2 large ones then had full on diarrhea the next day but felt good to clear the engine 🤣🤣🙊.

And now it's the same ie I take the dulcoease and the above tablets and a spoon of the laxative every night and still nothing ie no urge or anything unless I take 2 large spoons 😳
Really worried. What could have happened?? Are any of the meds I'm on causing it? (I don't eat dairy or gluten)

(I'm still waiting to get referred to a gastro and my doctors had the recommendation to refer me in January and still haven't done anything about it..I'm really pissed off now. They wouldn't do anything 2 years ago until id seen the immunologist so had to go private to make it happen faster but I called them last week and they had no clue who is even dealing with it 😡 (NHS).

Lately, I've been diving deep into the world of AI computers, and honestly, it's mind-blowing how they're changing our daily lives! From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to more advanced applications like ChatGPT (yeah, kind of like me right now!), [AI computers](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/lenovoauraedition/) are making life so much easier. For instance, I recently set up an AI-powered home automation system, and it's a game-changer. I can control lighting, temperature, and even my morning coffee with just a voice command or through an app. Plus, AI-driven tools are helping me at work with data analysis and automating repetitive tasks. It’s crazy how efficient things have become! I'm curious—how are you all using AI in your day-to-day life? Any cool experiences or recommendations? 

Let's discuss! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 😄",1,1742551469.0,TechnologyNewsByMe,0,1.0,False
1jgdc09,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1jgdc09/i_reached_to_1000_premium_users_less_than_than_3/,I reached to +1000 premium users less than than 3 months with these 10 rules,"Just wanted to share my journey of how I grew [peazehub.com](http://peazehub.com/) from a simple tool I made for my girlfriend to 1000+ users in under 3 months.

# 1. Start with a real problem, not a ""cool idea""

I never set out to build a business. My girlfriend was struggling with focus during studies, so I built her a simple productivity timer. Seeing how it transformed her study habits made me realize this could help others too.

When I decided to sell it, I had to narrow my focus and answer three critical questions:

* ""Who exactly do I want to sell to?""
* ""How can I find them?""
* ""How can I convince them it's worth paying for?""

I realized students were my perfect initial audience - they have a clear pain point (maintaining focus during long study sessions), they're already looking for solutions, and they talk to each other constantly. This clarity helped me craft everything from features to messaging.

# 2. Skip the freemium trap - charge a no-brainer price

One of my biggest early mistakes was offering a free tier and monthly subscriptions. I quickly learned: if users want to pay, they'll pay upfront. If they don't, no amount of ""try before you buy"" will convince them.

I switched to a single lifetime access price of just $9.99 - less than two coffees for most people in the West. No recurring payments, no complicated tiers, just instant access to everything.

This had three massive benefits:

* Eliminated ""tire-kickers"" who waste support time but never convert
* Created immediate revenue rather than hoping for conversions later
* Removed the mental barrier of ""another subscription""

As a SaaS owner, I learned the hard way: never try to satisfy people who don't pay you. Focus entirely on making paying customers ecstatic.

# 3. Make your app look cool - aesthetics drive growth

Here's something most productivity apps miss: aesthetics matter enormously. There are dozens of focus timers out there, but over 60% of my traffic comes from Instagram. Why? Because PeazeHub looks cool.

I invested heavily in visual design - beautiful activity heatmaps, achievement badges, and an overall UI that people actually want to screenshot and share. The GitHub-style progress tracking isn't just functional - it's visually satisfying.

This creates a viral loop: users share their progress because it looks impressive, their friends ask what app they're using, and suddenly I'm getting free marketing. Function matters, but in a crowded market, looking different is sometimes more important than being different.

# 4. Your landing page is your most important salesperson

No one will buy your product if your landing page doesn't immediately convince them it's worth it. It doesn't need fancy animations (though they help), but it absolutely must show:

* The exact problem you're solving
* Proof that your solution works
* How it's different from alternatives

I spent more time on my landing page than the app itself in the early days. Every element answers a specific objection: ""Is this worth my money?"" ""Will this actually help me?"" ""What if it doesn't work for me?""

The landing page is where trust begins. If it looks unprofessional or confusing, people assume your product is too.

# 5. Social proof is your secret weapon

I initially offered a free tier which helped me gather reviews and testimonials early. This was crucial - people need to see that others have already taken the risk and had success.

I display our 4.8/5 rating prominently, alongside real testimonials from students who improved their grades. The ""27 students joined in the last hour"" creates urgency and shows that others are voting with their wallets.

I update testimonials every two days. Why? Because fresh social proof shows an active, growing product that people love right now - not something that was good a year ago.

# 6. Listen to early users obsessively

If you're not getting users naturally, reach out directly. I offered free versions to get honest feedback - and not from friends or family who might sugarcoat their opinions.

Early users tell you what's actually valuable, not what you think is valuable. Some features I thought were game-changers got ignored, while minor things I almost cut became major selling points.

The key is implementing feedback quickly. When users see their suggestions implemented within days, they become evangelists who bring in more users.

# 7. Make your offer as risk-free as possible

My 30-day money-back guarantee removes the final barrier to purchase. Yes, occasionally someone asks for a refund (less than 1-2%), but it's worth it for the conversion boost.

People fear making bad purchases, especially online. A guarantee signals confidence in your product and transfers the risk from the buyer to you.

Combined with social proof, it creates a powerful message: ""Others love it, and if you don't, you lose nothing by trying.""

# 8. Consistency trumps perfection

I'll be honest - I got lucky a few times. Some posts went viral, and friends with 10K+ followers shared my app. But that luck only happened because I was consistently showing up, day after day.

Luck comes from trying repeatedly until something works. I posted daily, reached out to potential users, tweaked features, and tested messaging. Most of it failed, but it only takes a few wins to change everything.

The consistent effort compounds - each small improvement builds on the last until suddenly you're growing faster than you expected.

# 9. Test everything, but give tests time

Don't give up after 5 days of testing something new. Instead, check if you're executing correctly. Study competitors - how do the best in your niche market? What can you learn from them?

My process is simple: try → fail → analyze results → try again. But crucially, I give each test enough time to actually show results.

Testing isn't about finding what works once - it's about building a system of reliable growth tactics that work consistently.

# 10. Expand use cases carefully

I started by targeting students specifically, but once that was working, I expanded to developers, creators, and professionals.

The key is expanding methodically. If you have a marketing tool, start with social media marketers, then indie hackers, then startups. Each new audience should be adjacent to your current one, not completely different.

The more use cases you can demonstrate, the wider your potential market becomes - but only expand after you've dominated your initial niche.

The most surprising part of this journey was seeing how solving a specific problem for a specific group (students trying to focus) created such rapid growth. I'm now expanding to developers, creators, and professionals, but that initial focus was crucial.",1,1742551460.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False
1jgdbij,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1jgdbij/gf_of_3_years_emotionally_cheated_on_me/,GF of 3 years emotionally cheated on me,"We were in a three-year relationship, starting when I was 22 and she was 23. I tried to provide for her and gave her everything I could while still being a student. I'm from Sweden, and she's from Scotland. I visited her as often as I could, even though it wasn’t cheap for a student. I didn’t buy anything for myself because I saved all my money to be able to visit her. I funded her gaming setup, including a laptop and headset, and bought her a lot of Pokémon cards since she loved them. I paid for all our restaurant dates, groceries, and Airbnb stays when we were together.

Once, she had a medical emergency and thought she might be pregnant from the last time we were together. I immediately booked a ticket, not caring about the cost, because what mattered was that she needed me. I traveled 12 hours with no rest, straight from the plane to the bus. Whenever we were together, I always went grocery shopping and cooked for her. I bought her dresses and helped her with her studies when she was learning R programming for her research since I’m a game developer and familiar with programming languages.

Everything was fine until last year when I noticed my parents' health was declining. I wanted to buy them a house so they wouldn’t have to rent anymore. My parents left everything behind in Vietnam to relocate us to Sweden so I could get the best education. As their son, I felt it was my duty to repay them. I asked my ex if we could live in Sweden for at least two years while I saved up enough to get a mortgage and buy them a house. She said she loved Scotland and didn’t want to move.

I then asked if she could help me a little, and after I took care of my parents, in two or three years, we could move to Scotland and spend the rest of our lives together. I also started falling in love with Scotland—the people are nice, friendly, and welcoming, and the nature is beautiful. Then, last summer, I suggested that she move to Sweden and try to find a job that suited her profession. If she couldn't find one right away, she could work at a pub or bar, since she had experience in that industry. I knew she hated working in pubs or bars, but I wanted to give her an option. I also told her that if she really wanted to find a job that suited her, she could stay at home and keep searching while I provided for her.

I was raised in a culture where men give all their income to their wives, keeping only a little for themselves—for a coffee or drinks with friends. I wanted to give her everything she wanted, even if she stayed at home. That way, she could save up money, and we could buy a house in Scotland when we eventually moved there. She cried and said I didn’t consider her feelings. She asked why I even suggested she work in a bar if I knew she hated it. I tried to calm her down and reassured her that she didn’t have to work there if she didn’t want to. I even told her I could use my connections to help her get a job suited to her degree.

In August, I started my internship at a game company in Copenhagen, and things began to decline for us. I was busy and stressed with work because I wanted to impress my colleagues and secure a job. We used to talk and play together daily, but since I was so busy, I couldn't text or call as often. However, I still checked in with her every morning, texted her ""good morning,"" and sent pictures of what I was doing at work. She did the same.

But at night, when I got home, I was exhausted. Some days, I worked overtime until 2 or 3 AM and had to wake up at 7 AM. Around this time, she started reconnecting with a group of old friends—an American couple (a guy and a girl). I played with them once or twice, but I had so much on my plate that I couldn’t join them regularly.

In December, we planned to meet in Sweden. I prepared everything—places to visit, dates, restaurants, and even a ring to propose to her. But the day before her flight, she said she got sick from eating old food. Something felt off because everything had seemed fine the day before. I asked if she was okay and if I could visit her to take care of her, but she refused. That’s when I knew something was definitely wrong.

The morning of her flight, I texted her and asked if we should break up. She immediately said yes, without hesitation. I was so shocked that I just agreed without thinking. The next day, I realized I had made a huge mistake. I asked if we could meet, and she said she was in Copenhagen since she didn’t want to waste the trip.

I went to Copenhagen to see her. The first day, I asked if I could stay the night, but she said no. I respected her decision. I visited her again the next day, and we spent time at an amusement park. Everything felt normal. However, I had an emergency work situation, so I couldn't see her off at the airport when she left.

When she returned to Scotland, I texted her, begging her to reconsider. I told her I had bought a ring and was going to propose. I even told her I could move to Scotland if that’s what she wanted. But she said she didn’t want me there. I was shattered. I texted her long messages, asking her to give us another chance. She told me she needed time.

I tried so hard—I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, and fell into depression. I had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. She said I was “too much” but still wanted to be friends and text like normal.

One day, I reached my breaking point and tried to figure out what had happened. That’s when I discovered she had fallen for the guy in her gaming group—the American one. He had just been dumped by his girlfriend, and she was there to comfort him. They emotionally connected and fell in love, even though they had never met in real life.

I was shattered. She had emotionally cheated on me while we were still in a relationship. I now understood what people meant by ""monkey branching."" That night, I was ready to kill myself. The next day, my best friend took me to a psychiatric emergency unit. In January alone, I had to go there five times. I attempted to overdose on pills twice but failed. Then, I started planning a helium asphyxiation method, which is painless and easy to do in Europe.

On Valentine’s week, I booked a ticket to see her, hoping to salvage anything. She refused to meet me, fearing I would interfere with her life. I had never even met her best friends or family, while she had met my parents and best friend when she visited Sweden.

On Valentine’s Day, I waited outside her apartment for three hours with 50 roses, her favorite chocolate, and yogurt. When she saw me, she angrily walked inside and slammed the door shut. Then she texted me, cursing at me, telling me to ""fuck off"" and that she never wanted to see me again.

I wasn’t even shocked or angry—I felt nothing. That night, I drank heavily at a pub, thinking it would be my last night on Earth. I met some kind people, including an older man who worked in the NHS. He convinced me not to go through with it and made me promise to update him yearly. For some reason, I agreed.

I returned to Sweden and had many dark days. I started taking antidepressants, saw a therapist weekly, and tried to get my life together. She blocked me on everything—LinkedIn, Spotify, gaming platforms, Snapchat—everywhere.

I go to the gym almost every day now, trying to transform from 50kg to 59kg. I work on my career, co-founding a two-man game studio with my friend. We’re about to release our first mobile game globally in 10 days. Everyone says I’m doing well, but inside, I still feel like crap. I don’t enjoy gaming anymore. I don’t feel any joy in my achievements.

Suicidal thoughts still linger, and I always have a plan in place. I don’t know how to move forward. I tell myself it will be okay, but I don’t believe it. I just keep going, even though I feel empty inside.",2,1742551395.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1jgd9zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1jgd9zx/why_am_i_never_given_an_actual_bag/,Why am I never given an actual bag?,"This has been frustrating me for YEARS.

I am handed a donut in a little sachet, a breakfast sandwich in a wrapper, napkins just completely loose. No bag. Every single time. 

If I order a drink as well, instead of just being handed a bag and a drink, I am left grabbing a procession of things and putting them into my work bag one at a time like some kind of incredibly awkward assembly line. If I don’t have a bag, I literally just have to set them on the passenger seat in my car?!

And I mean, that’s one thing. But the thing that has really, really bothered me is the reaction I get when I ask for one. I just do not understand it, and it’s driving me insane. I have worked retail. I have worked in food service. Anywhere I have EVER worked, you ask for something small and insignificant like an extra bag or a double cup, it’s just handed to you. No comment, no questions asked, no worries. But every time I ask for the items to be put in a small bag, I am treated to either an interrogation or very uncomfortable interaction. 

At best, they look at me like I’ve asked them to please give me their first born child, while they search around looking for a bag like it’s a game of where’s Waldo or something. At worst (and most often this is what happens) they *literally argue with me* (?!?) about it. Just two days ago, I asked politely with a smile “could I please get a small bag to put these in?” As usual, the employee goes “you only have two items.” So I said, “I have to carry them into work.” And they go “they’re both in a bag” (they’re referring to the individual donut sachet and wrappers). So I’m like… “I have to carry a project for work, and a coffee, and a sandwich, loose napkins, and a donut, into the building and also take out my keys to enter the door. I can’t carry all that. Could I please have a bag?” And at that point, I feel like a total weirdo because why am I getting into this? Like I recognize that this is a weird interaction, but how else was I meant to respond? “You know what, forget it, nevermind?”

They begrudgingly hand me one like I’m the most unreasonable customer they’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. What is this about?! I am left feeling SO icky and uncomfortable about the whole thing. I never complain, or cause a hassle, or treat workers with disdain. I try very hard to always be reasonable and kind. But I constantly leave these establishments feeling like some kind of terrible jerk. I don’t have anything against the individual employees, just whatever policy or training results in this kind of immediate suspicion or hostility toward a random, well-meaning customer.

I feel like I’m in the twilight zone every time this happens. This is not how it works at any other restaurant. When I get a meal at McDonald’s, I’m not handed an individually wrapped McChicken or an individual Big Mac box, and then my fried, and then my napkins. Nor does this happen at A&W, or any other fast food place I’ve ever been to. And at Tim’s it’s worse, because at least McDonald burgers have a sticker, so if I were to drop it or carry it wrong, it’s at least intact. The breakfast sandwiches and similar items at Tim’s are just folded over. It’s happened before that while I’m trying to carry my various items and stuff for work, the fold came undone and it dropped on the ground. 

What’s the solution?! Just stop going there in the morning? I don’t do it every week, but it would be a shame to stop entirely over something that seems so asinine or trivial. But it’s genuinely enough of an inconvenience to be not worth it, and I don’t want to feel like a jerk all every time I go. Bring my own little bag and just keep it in the car and carry it back and forth with me from work to the car and back? I guess I could do that, but again, this has never happened anywhere else so it would be just for the random occasions I go to Tim’s. 

Is it an environmental thing? Because they always give me straws I don’t need and too many napkins. Why horde bags, specifically? Is this like…. a specific part of training to keep certain costs down? 

Somebody help me out with a “why” here. Anyone have insight?",1,1742551246.0,TimHortons,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, I PLEASE ASK THAT YOU ONLY MESSAGE ME IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

1jgd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1jgd99v/i_reached_to_1000_premium_users_less_than_than_3/,I reached to +1000 premium users less than than 3 months with these 10 rules,"Just wanted to share my journey of how I grew [peazehub.com](http://peazehub.com) from a simple tool I made for my girlfriend to 1000+ users in under 3 months.

# 1. Start with a real problem, not a ""cool idea""

I never set out to build a business. My girlfriend was struggling with focus during studies, so I built her a simple productivity timer. Seeing how it transformed her study habits made me realize this could help others too.

When I decided to sell it, I had to narrow my focus and answer three critical questions:

* ""Who exactly do I want to sell to?""
* ""How can I find them?""
* ""How can I convince them it's worth paying for?""

I realized students were my perfect initial audience - they have a clear pain point (maintaining focus during long study sessions), they're already looking for solutions, and they talk to each other constantly. This clarity helped me craft everything from features to messaging.

# 2. Skip the freemium trap - charge a no-brainer price

One of my biggest early mistakes was offering a free tier and monthly subscriptions. I quickly learned: if users want to pay, they'll pay upfront. If they don't, no amount of ""try before you buy"" will convince them.

I switched to a single lifetime access price of just $9.99 - less than two coffees for most people in the West. No recurring payments, no complicated tiers, just instant access to everything.

This had three massive benefits:

* Eliminated ""tire-kickers"" who waste support time but never convert
* Created immediate revenue rather than hoping for conversions later
* Removed the mental barrier of ""another subscription""

As a SaaS owner, I learned the hard way: never try to satisfy people who don't pay you. Focus entirely on making paying customers ecstatic.

# 3. Make your app look cool - aesthetics drive growth

Here's something most productivity apps miss: aesthetics matter enormously. There are dozens of focus timers out there, but over 60% of my traffic comes from Instagram. Why? Because PeazeHub looks cool.

I invested heavily in visual design - beautiful activity heatmaps, achievement badges, and an overall UI that people actually want to screenshot and share. The GitHub-style progress tracking isn't just functional - it's visually satisfying.

This creates a viral loop: users share their progress because it looks impressive, their friends ask what app they're using, and suddenly I'm getting free marketing. Function matters, but in a crowded market, looking different is sometimes more important than being different.

# 4. Your landing page is your most important salesperson

No one will buy your product if your landing page doesn't immediately convince them it's worth it. It doesn't need fancy animations (though they help), but it absolutely must show:

* The exact problem you're solving
* Proof that your solution works
* How it's different from alternatives

I spent more time on my landing page than the app itself in the early days. Every element answers a specific objection: ""Is this worth my money?"" ""Will this actually help me?"" ""What if it doesn't work for me?""

The landing page is where trust begins. If it looks unprofessional or confusing, people assume your product is too.

# 5. Social proof is your secret weapon

I initially offered a free tier which helped me gather reviews and testimonials early. This was crucial - people need to see that others have already taken the risk and had success.

I display our 4.8/5 rating prominently, alongside real testimonials from students who improved their grades. The ""27 students joined in the last hour"" creates urgency and shows that others are voting with their wallets.

I update testimonials every two days. Why? Because fresh social proof shows an active, growing product that people love right now - not something that was good a year ago.

# 6. Listen to early users obsessively

If you're not getting users naturally, reach out directly. I offered free versions to get honest feedback - and not from friends or family who might sugarcoat their opinions.

Early users tell you what's actually valuable, not what you think is valuable. Some features I thought were game-changers got ignored, while minor things I almost cut became major selling points.

The key is implementing feedback quickly. When users see their suggestions implemented within days, they become evangelists who bring in more users.

# 7. Make your offer as risk-free as possible

My 30-day money-back guarantee removes the final barrier to purchase. Yes, occasionally someone asks for a refund (less than 1-2%), but it's worth it for the conversion boost.

People fear making bad purchases, especially online. A guarantee signals confidence in your product and transfers the risk from the buyer to you.

Combined with social proof, it creates a powerful message: ""Others love it, and if you don't, you lose nothing by trying.""

# 8. Consistency trumps perfection

I'll be honest - I got lucky a few times. Some posts went viral, and friends with 10K+ followers shared my app. But that luck only happened because I was consistently showing up, day after day.

Luck comes from trying repeatedly until something works. I posted daily, reached out to potential users, tweaked features, and tested messaging. Most of it failed, but it only takes a few wins to change everything.

The consistent effort compounds - each small improvement builds on the last until suddenly you're growing faster than you expected.

# 9. Test everything, but give tests time

Don't give up after 5 days of testing something new. Instead, check if you're executing correctly. Study competitors - how do the best in your niche market? What can you learn from them?

My process is simple: try → fail → analyze results → try again. But crucially, I give each test enough time to actually show results.

Testing isn't about finding what works once - it's about building a system of reliable growth tactics that work consistently.

# 10. Expand use cases carefully

I started by targeting students specifically, but once that was working, I expanded to developers, creators, and professionals.

The key is expanding methodically. If you have a marketing tool, start with social media marketers, then indie hackers, then startups. Each new audience should be adjacent to your current one, not completely different.

The more use cases you can demonstrate, the wider your potential market becomes - but only expand after you've dominated your initial niche.

The most surprising part of this journey was seeing how solving a specific problem for a specific group (students trying to focus) created such rapid growth. I'm now expanding to developers, creators, and professionals, but that initial focus was crucial.",1,1742551163.0,microsaas,0,0.67,False

Looking at the order book, we can see that we are still ranging between two key zones. This means institutions are still holding this area for position accumulation.

📊 Liquidity Breakdown

🔹 Buy Orders (Bids):

	•	$83,600 – $84,000: 930 BTC in limit buy orders.
	•	$84,000 – $84,250: 650 BTC in buy orders.
	•	Below $83,500: Huge liquidity reserves, but no visible cluster of orders.

🔻 Sell Orders (Asks):

	•	$84,800 – $85,000: 1,050 BTC in sell orders.
	•	$85,500: 1,350 BTC, a high concentration of liquidity, possibly market makers positioning.
	•	$86,500 – $88,000: A large amount of stop liquidity is placed. If broken, we can expect a strong impulse move, which I’ve been waiting for all this time. Those stops are still untouched.

⚡ Futures Market & Potential Short Squeeze

	•	Open Interest at $84,250: More than 5,000 BTC held in positions.
	•	Key Liquidity Cluster still above $85,000 → a possible short squeeze scenario.
	•	Balance is shifting towards limit buyers in the $83,600 – $84,000 range.
	•	$84,800 has a large number of sell orders, but market participants may pull them at any moment.

📈 Summary:

✅ $83,600 – $84,000 → Strong Buy Zone (institutional accumulation).

✅ $84,800 – $85,500 → Sell Zone, where liquidity may be collected before a move higher.

✅ $86,500 – $88,000 → Liquidity grab zone, where stops could trigger a squeeze and push us even higher.

📌 As always, manage your risk. Bitcoin remains bullish as long as we trade within this range. Only major news could push us out of this accumulation channel. If we hold this momentum, institutions will likely shift their accumulation zone higher from the current range.

Fantastic looking machine. The scale details, size and weight are all impressive. 

There are only 3 fairly minor gremlins that I want to work out. 

1. Either the radio or control system functions poorly at low inputs. The controls are proportional, but mostly unusable below 1/2 stick. The motors cut out sporadically and will sometimes stall and the stick will go dead. The stick then has to be released to reset the movements. I know this machine uses brushed motors and a motherboard so I'm not expecting perfection, but its a little annoying. Everything works great at high speeds, but one of the biggest selling points for me was proportional control and this unit is either defective, or it's just not very good. 

2. The slewing motor control is abrupt, and also lacking fine control. This could be linked to problem #1, or it's also just not that good.  It's impossible to stop a swing gently, and starting is almost as abrupt. It's a huge bummer to nail a bucket fill, then lose half of it when the slewing motor locks up

3. The stick actuator screw is either bent or out of alignment. You can hear it binding up and see the cylinder move while it's running. Could be shipping damage, or a factory defect, or it could be normal and I'm just noticing too much. 

Overall I'm satisfied with the machine. It's a good value for the money especially if you can find one on sale, and I think there's plenty of room to grow into some upgrades and tinker. I think one of the first things I'm going to do is probably a better radio and receiver with some proper speed control, and maybe even a brushless slewing motor if I can find parts. 

Any experience or advice with the control/actuator issues is much appreciated!

Going through my city centre yesterday, I kept asking myself ""Could I have approached her ?"" and the answer was YES...There was zero anxiety arising. I hope to confirm that soon as on this first week my head is utterly 101% mashed off the stuff...I actually went to an NLP guy last year to help with this as during coffee shop dates I was a nervous wreck for this first vital 20 minutes zone of first impressions.

I'd take it right up to 5 double lattes a day at my peak, last year and on either side of that, it would be 3-4 doubles a day from coffee shops.

His desk was an organized chaos of cables, gadgets, and empty energy drink cans. We had a routine where we'd share the latest tech gossip over coffee, which always made the long coding sessions bearable.Then there was our office manager, Helen. Helen was notorious for her disdain for technology. She'd only use the printer when absolutely necessary, and even then, it was with a scowl that could curdle milk. Her desk was a stark contrast to Raj's, almost bare, except for one peculiar item - a vintage rotary phone that she swore by.One day, our CEO decided we needed to go paperless. He instructed Helen to digitize all our records, which included a mountain of old invoices and contracts. Helen was visibly unhappy about this, muttering under her breath about how ""the internet was just a fad.""Raj, always eager to help, offered to assist her, but Helen insisted she'd manage on her own. Days passed, and we'd see her at her desk, glaring at the computer screen like it was a personal enemy.One Friday, as we were wrapping up for the weekend, Raj whispered to me, ""Helen's got a secret... she's been sneaking in extra USB drives.""I raised an eyebrow, but before I could ask more, Helen stormed out, claiming she had an ""emergency"" at home.The following Monday, the office was abuzz with whispers. Helen hadn't returned, and her desk was untouched. Curiosity got the better of us, and with the CEO's reluctant permission, we opened her desk drawer.Inside, instead of USB drives, we found stacks of those same old invoices, now neatly folded into origami shapes - cranes, frogs, even a small dragon. It was like she had been running her own little origami factory right under our noses.The mystery deepened when we checked her computer.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Especially if your frying pan can talk, and tomatoes and coffee beans are being discussed on the kitchen table.

""Stop doubting,"" the frying pan said, its sooty side shining. ""I've seen worse things: cooks who confuse cumin with caraway, and cooks who add grated carrots to pilaf!""

""This is a crime against common sense,"" the tomato nodded, swinging importantly on the plate.

""Absolutely right,"" the frying pan picked up. ""Real Tamerlane's pilaf is not some kind of boiled rice porridge with additives. This is art, this is philosophy, this is victory over chaos in the world of cereals.

I sighed and decided not to argue with the kitchen utensils.

""Let's start with oil,"" the frying pan continued. ""Tamerlane used fat tail fat in his pilaf. It gives the dish a characteristic depth of flavor, you understand?"" I nodded in agreement and sent the fat tail pieces into the heated frying pan. They sizzled like ancient warriors before battle.

""Now the onion, but don't overdo it!"" the tomato exclaimed. ""The onion should be cut into half rings and fried until golden brown, not until it's like coals from a wood-burning oven."" I carefully added the onion, following the wise instructions of the vegetable.

""Meat!"" the frying pan solemnly proclaimed. ""Lamb, of course. And don't you dare cut it into small pieces!"" I obediently sent large pieces of lamb into the frying pan. They began to brown, emitting a smell that could possibly inspire Tamerlane's army to new conquests.

\- Spices! - coffee beans intervened. - The main thing is not to mix them up!

\- If you put cinnamon in now, I'll leave the house! - threatened the tomato.

\- No way, - muttered the frying pan. - Here's cumin, here's barberry, here's black pepper. And, of course, salt.

\- Don't forget the saffron! - reminded the tomato. - It will give the rice that very sunny shade that Tamerlane loved so much.

I carefully sprinkled in the spices, and the air was filled with aromas that could be called weapons of mass seduction.

\- And now the carrots, - continued the frying pan. - Yellow, cut into strips.

\- The main thing is not grated! - exclaimed the tomato and coffee beans in chorus.

The carrots went to join the meat and spices, acquiring a golden-orange hue.

\- Water! - the frying pan commanded. - Just enough to cover the meat. And no more!

I poured in the water, and the frying pan rumbled contentedly.

\- Now we wait, - she said.

I sat down on a stool while my kitchen was filled with the spirit of history.

\- You know, - the tomato said thoughtfully, - they say that Tamerlane ate pilaf before every important battle. He believed that good food makes an army invincible.

\- Absolutely right, - the frying pan confirmed. - And at his feasts, pilaf was served in huge ceramic dishes decorated with lapis lazuli.

\- These are not plastic containers, - the coffee beans grumbled.

Time passed, the water was absorbed, and it was time to add rice.

— The rice should be piled up without stirring! — the frying pan reminded.

I did everything as instructed.

— Now turn down the heat and wait, — it commanded.

I sat down again and wiped my forehead. Cooking Tamerlane's pilaf is probably more serious than waging a war.

After a while, the frying pan announced contentedly:

— It's ready.

I carefully removed the lid. The aroma was such that even the tomato fell silent in awe.

— Magnificent! — the coffee beans admired. — Tamerlane would have approved.

I took a spoon, tasted the pilaf and realized: yes, this is truly a victory.",1,1742550040.0,u_After_Instruction548,0,1.0,False

I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with **persistent bloating for over 6 months**, and despite many tests, lifestyle changes, and supplements, I still don’t have a clear answer. I’m hoping someone out there has been through something similar and might have insights. Also had serious sleep issues off and on, and exercise intolerance, some tinnitus never ending.

 **Tests I’ve Done (All “Normal”):**

* Full blood panel
* Thyroid, liver, kidney, cholesterol
* hsCRP (low, no systemic inflammation)
* HbA1c (normal)
* Colonoscopy & Endoscopy (nothing found)
* SIBO breath test (negative)
* Stool test (basic; no lactoferrin or comprehensive markers)

 **Things I’ve Tried:**

* **Betaine HCl** (I think made me feel worse after a few days though only took 2 tablets)
* **Probiotics (various strengths)** – no clear improvement
* **NAC** (still taking it)
* **AG1** (seems to worsen bloating im not sure i stopped for a while but not much changed)
* **Low-FODMAP temporarily, not sustained**
* **No wine for 10 days** (still monitoring impact, usually 4 glasses week at most),
* **Magnesium, electrolytes (Sodii), sleep supplements (mag threonate, glycine)**
* **Diet is now somewhat very clean – rice, chicken, eggs, cooked veg, some fruit, no processed food, coffee etc**

 **Symptoms:**

* Bloating starts almost immediately after eating, especially dinner hangs around non stop
* Mornings are usually better
* Bloating doesn’t always correlate to the amount or type of food but there is clear shortness of breath when bloated badly
* Sometimes comes with **shallow breathing, fatigue, and vagus-like tension**
* Wine makes it worse
* HRV is improving, but bloating persists
* I’ve taken breaks from exercise & supplements – bloating still stayed

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

# Sarcasm warning!

**Here's my list:**

**1. AI Generated & Over Edited Photography**

Hands that look like they were designed by a blindfolded toddler with a crayon, faces too perfect to be real, skin smoother than plastic, and necks that don’t follow any anatomy class. Hair always perfectly disheveled. If you had to write a prompt to create something “artistic” that even my cat could do, are you really the artist, or just the nerd who wrote the code? It’s not you.

**2. Delusional Street Photography**

Caught a random person mid-bite into a sandwich? Oh, how edgy. Even better, capture some random soul doing nothing in a common setting. What an insightful capture of the human condition. News flash: If I wanted to see a guy waiting for the bus, I’d just go outside. And if you try to argue that street photography shows things we wouldn’t notice, here’s a thought: maybe the reason we didn’t notice is because it’s f\*ckin boring!!!

**3. Artificially Added People with Umbrellas in Unreal Situations**

Nothing screams ""I'm pretending this is artistic"" like tossing an umbrella into a shot that clearly doesn’t need one. It’s like you just found one lying around and thought, “Well, this’ll make it look interesting!” It doesn’t. Especially when it’s placed in a deserted place, on steps that lead nowhere, or in front of the sea. Just stop pretending it’s deep when it’s clearly not.

**4. Boudoir Photography (The Cheesy & Cheap Kind)**

Boudoir can be beautiful, but if your shoot looks like a late-night infomercial for a “sexy” mattress, we have a problem. If the lighting screams “motel room at 2 AM,” the satin sheets are so cheap they could double as a slip ‘n slide, and the poses could use a visit from a professional, just stop. It’s not sexy, maybe only for men with no fantasy.

**5. Over Saturated Flowers Taken by Mobile Phones**

Do you have a filter addiction? We get it, flowers are pretty. But making them look like radioactive versions of themselves just ruins the charm.

**6. Upside Down Photos of a Puddle Reflecting Something**

Oh, you took a picture of a puddle reflecting something? Wow, groundbreaking. First time I’ve seen that. Seriously, this was cool when one person did it for the first time, but now? It's a tired cliché. Stop pretending you invented reflection photography and get creative.

**7. Cringe Portrait Photography**

“Baby in a flowerpot.” “Man in a trench coat, staring into the void like he’s waiting for his existential crisis to hit.” What is this, a bad cosplay convention? If your “portrait” looks like something straight out of an influencer’s cringey mood board, we’re not amused.

**8. Overdone Instagram Trends**

“Girl in flowy dress, back turned, staring at a mountain.” “Moody coffee shop shot with soft lighting.” “Neon cyberpunk streets, oh look, it’s the same damn shot everyone else posted yesterday.” You’re not unique, you’re just checking boxes. Originality called, it's dead. But hey, at least the engagement’s high.

**9. Ancient wars reenactments**

Grown adults in awkward costumes pretending to relive battles no one remembers. It’s all the kind of stuff only local nerds get excited about. Zero artistic feel.

**10. Street portraits of people smiling at the camera**

No context, no depth, just random, whether spontaneous or not, moments captured with no artistic feel whatsoever. These photos will only serve as someone's Facebook avatar for a couple of weeks before fading into oblivion.",0,1742549891.0,photography,41,0.3,False
1jgcycj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationTheory/comments/1jgcycj/being_a_god_is_real/,Being a 'god' is real.,"Whatever you think you're doing subconsciously or out of habit will end up saving you from tons of suffering. This life is hidden with countless ""gods"" that you can't see. :)

God is ""good"" by default, and being ""alive"" in this world is the ultimate test—one that you will eventually pass. Everything that life pushes you toward is directed by God, and everything that happens to you is meant to teach you the hardest lessons. Being ""alive"" automatically means that, at some point, you'll temporarily experience what it's like to be ""God."" And everything you're doing—even the things you don't consider ""godly""—will ultimately save you from suffering.

That includes all the fantasy shows and movies you chose to watch, the tiniest video games, the ""bad"" friends you made, the workouts that make you stronger, the random small talk, the coffee breaks, the moments you didn't look your best, the countless failures, and even believing in the ""wrong"" religions. If you try to break God's rules, you'll eventually realize why they were there in the first place—no matter how ""bad"" they seemed or how much you ""hated"" them. :)

You are part of the planet, which is part of the galaxies, which are part of the universe, which is part of God, which is part of something even greater. Even pain and hardship will turn out to be valuable lessons, and you'll realize it's far better to feel something—pain, noise, struggle—than to feel nothing at all. :)

Even the tiniest thing you do will matter in the long run—every mundane moment, every so-called ""mistake.""

So take your happiness seriously, because you never know when you might need it. ;)

And you can't truly suffocate or erase ""life"" from yourself without blossoming in the end. Even the smallest things—like ""ants""—will matter in ways you can’t yet imagine. :)

Enjoy your life, be yourself, and don’t forget your name. Then you'll understand why you can’t become ""God""—and why it's much better to be a flawed human who knows nothing.",3,1742549809.0,SimulationTheory,1,0.71,False

Today is my 34th birthday and I just feel blah …
I have no plans today unfortunately since my oldest is in school until 03:15, && 3 year old doesn’t have preschool Fridays. 
My husband has also had SWAT training these last two weeks and the times have varied on when he gets home.
I’m also 28 weeks pregnant and have been feeling horrible.

I used to love celebrating my birthday, going out on a date night with my husband or friends even if it wasn’t on my birthday, doing something with the kid’s etc.
My husband is the type of person that if his birthday comes up it’s just another day but I always surprise him, make his favorite dinner, the kids make a home made cake & cards or I’ll buy his favorite cake.

This year just feels different I guess. My husband and I have been on the outs for a while. When I asked him what time he’ll be home on my birthday from his last day of SWAT I get told he doesn’t know yet. He has a graduation today after the last hands on portion of the test. He will be gassed and pepper sprayed for it which I feel really bad about but it’s apart of the job. I have a feeling when he gets home he’s going to be tired.
All the guys on the SWAT team in the department plus the chief will be there at this graduation and they are apparently grilling out… I asked what time this is at to no avail. 
No families are invited.

I feel like maybe I am sounding selfish but I guess I’m just a little bit bummed out that there’s no definite plan as to what is going on today.
To be honest I was hoping he had some time this week to have my boys make me a homemade card but I don’t think he’s done that.
Or even take them somewhere to pick me out a small gift.

I ended up buying myself a birthday gift that I’ve been wanting for a while.
It’s kind of stupid but it’s a Skylight Calendar… my husband tends to not look at the calendar I had on the fridge all organized and coordinated. I even tried to link calendars on our phones to no avail. I know it will be handy for myself at least with scheduling , lists, recipes etc. 
I even sent him the link last night to download the app since we’ve had it for a week and he’s still asking what time baseball practice is for both my kids. I told him last night I’m not a secretary or calendar reminder.

I thought maybe after I drop off my 6 year old at school that I’ll take my 3 year old to this cute little coffee shop with me.

My mom offered to watch my boys overnight but I had to decline because I don’t know when my husband will even be home and my kids have baseball practice early in the morning (one is in tball and the other in coach pitch).

Lightweight yet sturdy, these chairs are perfect for creating that laid-back vibe we all crave in an outdoor space. Rattan’s natural texture adds warmth and an organic feel, while modern shapes and plush cushions keep things fresh and comfortable.

Place a pair of rattan armchairs on your porch or patio with a small side table in between for the perfect reading corner. Or style them around a low coffee table for a lounge-like setting that encourages conversation and connection.

**Dining Outdoors with Rattan Dining Chairs**

Nothing beats an alfresco meal — especially when the seating is both stylish and supportive. [Rattan dining chair](https://homeandsouldubai.com/collections/outdoor-dining-chairs) bring the same rustic charm as armchairs but are designed with practicality in mind.

The right patio furniture turns your outdoor area into a personal oasis — and rattan pieces, especially armchairs and dining chairs, are key to achieving that inviting, boho-chic feel.

God is ""good"" by default, and being ""alive"" in this world is the ultimate test—one that you will eventually pass. Everything that life pushes you toward is directed by God, and everything that happens to you is meant to teach you the hardest lessons. Being ""alive"" automatically means that, at some point, you'll temporarily experience what it's like to be ""God."" And everything you're doing—even the things you don't consider ""godly""—will ultimately save you from suffering.

That includes all the fantasy shows and movies you chose to watch, the tiniest video games, the ""bad"" friends you made, the workouts that make you stronger, the random small talk, the coffee breaks, the moments you didn't look your best, the countless failures, and even believing in the ""wrong"" religions. If you try to break God's rules, you'll eventually realize why they were there in the first place—no matter how ""bad"" they seemed or how much you ""hated"" them. :)

You are part of the planet, which is part of the galaxies, which are part of the universe, which is part of God, which is part of something even greater. Even pain and hardship will turn out to be valuable lessons, and you'll realize it's far better to feel something—pain, noise, struggle—than to feel nothing at all. :)

Even the tiniest thing you do will matter in the long run—every mundane moment, every so-called ""mistake.""

So take your happiness seriously, because you never know when you might need it. ;)

And you can't truly suffocate or erase ""life"" from yourself without blossoming in the end. Even the smallest things—like ""ants""—will matter in ways you can’t yet imagine. :)

This was something I'd been considering since day one, as the standard 3.3 kW charging rate, while manageable, definitely had its limitations.

Last season, my day-long rides often involved lengthy charging stops at public stations. Explaining to curious onlookers that my bike took four hours for a full charge wasn't exactly thrilling. While I rarely drained the battery completely, the reality was that my mountain adventures were punctuated by frequent, extended breaks for coffee and charging.

As my confidence with the DSR grew, I started planning more ambitious tours for this year, including a challenging 1,000 km trip through the Dolomites with a staggering 10,000 meters of elevation gain. To tackle this, I knew I needed to upgrade my charging capabilities.  
Initially, I thought I could purchase and activate the upgrade through the Zero app. It was a bit misleading to see it in the shopping cart, prompting for credit card details. However, I soon discovered that the upgrade required a dealer visit. So, I scheduled an appointment and left my DSR at the dealership for a week.

**Was it worth the €1020?**

Even if it needs a long testing period, I can already anticipate that the difference is almost night and day. Charging times are significantly reduced, transforming my charging stops from something that needed accurate planning into enjoyable breaks. Instead of anxiously watching the clock, I can now relax, grab a coffee, and simply remember to unplug when it's done.

Just to have an idea:

* **Before:** A 6.4 kWh charge took 1 hour and 50 minutes.
* **After:** The same 6.4 kWh charge now takes just 1 hour!

Similar to electric cars, I've noticed the charging rate does taper off as the battery's state of charge (SOC) increases. This is a standard characteristic of lithium-ion batteries.

With this upgrade, I feel more confident about my upcoming Dolomites adventure (I'll post it here). The faster charging will allow me to maximize my riding time and minimize downtime.",1,1742548959.0,ZeroMotorcycles,0,1.0,False

For context, I am no longer in good terms with my father (54) since December last year. I needed to stay here sa bahay so I can look after him since he gets sick more often and yung kinakasama nya laging wala, once a week lang umuwi dahil preferred stay in sa bahay ng amo nya since nagbabantay sya ng bata. 1hr byahe mula samin hanggang don sa bahay ng amo nya. Btw, sa city nako nagsstay since pandemic since malapit sa workplace ko yon. 

Nung isang gabi, he was complaining masakit ang tyan nya. Sabi ko kumain sya ulit if nagugutom sya. Sabi nya walang ulam, sabi ko may adobo pa di naman naubos food nung dinner. That was around 11pm nung nagsabi sya. 

After nyang kumain nagsuka na sya ng nagsuka. I don't feel pity at all, tbh nagalit lang ako puro galit nararamdaman ko. Naipong galit haha. 

I was asking him kung gusto nyang magpadala sa ospital habang maaga pa. Hindi raw. I immediately booked pabili service sa panda go para magpabili ng gaviscon liquid kase baka GERD na naman kagaya last November nung naconfine sya. 7x ba naman magkape buong araw e 2 sachets ng san mig coffee pa each cup. yosi isang kaha isang araw. parang every 5mins nagsisindi. 

I have been reminding him constantly sa lahat ng bawal ng food and bisyo nya. Pero ewan ko, katuwiran nya bakit kita susundin e anak ka lang. Bat ako susunod sa doctor eh nagugutom ako. Yes, he's diabetic and hypertensive. Stroke patient back in 2020- thankfully nakarecover. He's okay naman malakas naman katawan. Lakas nya ko murahin at pagsalitaan ng masasakit e. 

I'm a breadwinner and kahit ipangutang, I'm doing it to provide.Lalo ngayon nawalan akong trabaho and when that happened he told me and my partner na malas at perwisyo ksmi kaya dapat umalis kami sa bahay. this was last month. pero wala kaming ipon dahil lahat ng pera namin naubos pagpapagamot sa kanya back in November when he had his surgery but this is for another story. sorry. 

So ayun nga, past 12midnight ongoing yung order ko for the meds to be delivered when he told us na dalhin na sya sa ospital since sobrang sakit na ng tyan nya at nanghihina na sya. Again, hindi ako naaawa sa kanya nagpupuyos pa ko sa galit non kaya kahit gago ako sa part na to for telling my partner na dalhin sya sa ospital and hindi ako sasama sinabi ko pa din sa kanya. My partner immediately called the brgy tanod and asked to borrow the community ambulance to bring him to the hospital. 

Nag-away pa kami ni partner ng konti pagbalik nya galing brgy hall kase nga ayoko sumama and sya ang pinapasama ko. Sabi ko susunod nalang ako kase iintayin ko pa yung order na gamot. Nagalit sya and iniwan na ko sa bahay. 

30mins later dumating yung order and sumunod nako don sa ospital. I just asked kuya food panda rider if okay lang. Buti walang booking. 

And yon, kalmado naman na partner ko pagdating ko don. tulog si papa. But I still didn't feel anything at all except galit We waited until he got discharged at 6am. Di pa bayad hospital bill, nagpromisory note lang ako kase 300 lang ang pera ko and more than 4k yung bill plus sobrang daming gamot. Possible kidney stones and may UTI daw ang tatay ko sabi that's why he experienced that.

Ngayon nasa Manila ako to attend a potential work interview. My partner texted me and was very disappointed dahil naninigarilyo na naman daw si papa. Told me to not buy him any meds and that he's not gonna accompany him any longer when he gets sick again. I understand him, cause this is not the first time it happened. And actually even before naman sinabi ko na sa tatay ko na sayang labg mga ginagastos na pambili ng gamot nya dahil ginagawa nya pa din lahat ng bawal ang katuwiran sakin wala syang pakialam wag na syang bilhan ng gamot dahil ayaw nya non. 

Now, ABYG kung ayoko ng bilhan ng gamot ang tatay ko? Sayang lang talaga. Partida yung 600+ worth na gamot na binili ko kaninang umaga inutang ko pa. Hindi pa kumpleto kase pinagkakasya ko lang yung pera. Pasalamat talaga ko may mabubuting tao na tumutulong pa din sakin.

Lighting affects my mood, and it can either make me productive or completely useless.

Taffeta is big, really big. But the noise level completely cancels out this positive aspect. For me, a café is a place where you can talk and work, but the noise here rivals *Town Coffee*. However, if you go early in the morning, you *might* have a chance to sit in peace.

The coffee I tried was Vietnamese. It was around ₹290, so a bit on the expensive side. My friend ordered South Indian filter coffee and she loved it. But for me, the Vietnamese coffee had strong chocolaty notes, and I hate chocolate—so that affected my experience. That said, the coffee was unique in one regard: it was *strong*. For the first time, I didn't get that hyper-motivated buzz after drinking it; instead, I became calm and hyper-focused. So, points for that.

The lighting inside was decent, but again, the noise level ruined it, especially at night. If you visit early in the morning—around 7:30-8 AM—you're in for a treat. The big glass panels work beautifully with the morning sunlight. Plus, you can even take your date there… *if she’s willing to wake up that early, lol.* You'll get an awesome ambiance for a date, and you can sit outside and breathe in fresh oxygen, thanks to its proximity to Jawahar Circle Garden.

So yeah, that’s it. The food is good. I need a few more visits and tastings before I can properly rate their coffee. I think I need to try their Americano and French Press to judge the quality of their beans accurately.",14,1742548361.0,jaipur,6,1.0,False

I like to create eyeshadow looks and post on my IG. But then had a baby. I was super tired and nauseous my entire pregnancy and since then I’m busy being a mom. I have no time to play with my makeup like before. Last year I kept buying things as a compensation for being attached to the baby and being stuck inside the house. But this year I decided to be slightly less delusional and try to save money and go on a no buy. January was great, didn’t buy anything, didn’t have the urge to. But since then I’ve fallen off. My husband keeps questioning when I buy things, for the baby or the house or anything. I’m supposed to discuss and take approval. But he can spend or use his money without discussing things with me? I feel like a thief being questioned all the time and if I get short on patience with the baby I buy things to reward myself. I browse all day, all I think about is the next best thing to get. I don’t even wear makeup everyday, only occasionally, I have enough to last me a life time but I keep rage buying. Please help me stop. More info- I had a monthly budget before I was pregnant but I would stick to it sometimes and sometimes go over it. I don’t mind sticking to it, but I hate being questioned over stuff that the baby needs, or something like a new coffee machine that only I would use, since only I drink coffee. My husband has a very simplistic way of things,  but I feel if something will make my life easier I should have it. I have to argue with him about buying simple things as a pot or pan because the old one’s non stick coating is all scratched off, he says I keep making excuses to buy new things. Everything is a discussion!! Baby needs a plate why? We have a plates at home. But I need a plate that the baby won’t send flying off into the oblivion!!! Baby glass why? Baby new shoes why? I think of all the reasons and explain, it increases my mental load, only to get rejected. He doesn’t realize that I do both the pros and cons and things I reject I don’t even tell him. I hate bringing the topic of buying new things because I feel like a beggar, it gives me so much anxiety. But that makes me angry and pushes me towards buying things. Sorry for the rant. 
My husband bought me a new camera to photograph my makeup things, it’s not like he doesn’t let me buy anything. But I get so anxious that I go into a negative spiral and I start catastrophizing.

My bf (28M) and I (30F) are dating again after a big break. We had a turbulent relationship in 2023 where sadly due to both of us struggling with mental health we weren’t good to one another. The issue for me from that time has primarily been other women. He was flirtatious on Valorant, always some egirls in his discord, any time we fought he would break up with me telling me he’s found someone better, making me jealous, comparing me to other girls, insulting my physical appearance, talking about celebs who is hot to him, he has a praise kink and voice kink and would let me know against my will who fulfills that. Several situations of micro cheating happened, he ended up leaving me for another girl (he later claimed it was just a date as revenge for me hanging out with a male friend the day before), and shortly after that we were done for good.

He reached out again a year and a half later saying how he is sorry for messing things up with me and that he still loves me. My feelings for him were very strong when things were good so i decided to meet him for coffee.

We ended up getting back together and this time around he has been the perfect partner. He’s not done anything bad, he’s been more than understanding for my trust issues, mental health struggles etc.

Really perfect in every sense. Attentive, proactive, romantic.

However there were still skeletons in the closet. I went through his IG messages and there was a guy who was so obviously gay or bi, and flirting with him. Sending male thirst traps. My bf welcomed this. The entire convo made me uncomfortable because my bf said in 2023 he is bi, but now in 2025 he said he’s straight. So finding this convo made me feel like he lied. In the convo they were talking about types and my bf said Asians are his nr 1. I am not Asian. I am physically the complete opposite of the archetypical small nose, fox eyes, big lips, youthful romantic girly face. Also, I’m not getting younger. I’m gonna be 31 this year and I most definitely do not look like those girls (which also concerns me that he seems to gravitate to really young women).

And the egirls he had around fell into this archetype. He once “accidentally” sent a photo or comment to me and it was about a girl who looks like that.

I saw some posts with his like on it and the girls are usually busty Asians or goth girls with tats.

The thing is, before I knew any of this, he told me, out of nowhere, not asked by me, that he thinks “Asians are gross and look like children and how could anyone find them attractive” — pretty weird statement in itself.

He liked a video of a goth girl with tats the day before he said he loved me and he justified it by saying his “feelings weren’t that strong for me” but somehow they were strong enough to think of me for a year and a half and reach out lol.

To sum it up, his behavior and words exhibit a clear pattern of him liking certain archetypes that do not look like me. I’m not Asian nor goth and have 0 tats. When I asked if he would like me to change my appearance or wear outfits he said noooo omg ur perfect the way you are. So even when I offer to look similar to his type he rejects it. I offered to do kinks I know he has and he rejected that too, saying “maybe in a few months or years”.

I could compartmentalize this and feel confident in the relationship when it comes to attraction but recently it’s just been one thing after the other and my brain won’t shut up about the pattern that I see and I’m afraid I’ll get cheated on again. I’m in a heightened emotional state so it’s really hard to do my usual stuff that helps me deal with this. It’s always in the back of my head. His reassuring words don’t help.

Thanks for anyone’s advice.",2,1742547414.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
1jgcecl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1jgcecl/love_is_the_mutual_becoming_of_two_selves_a/,"Love is the Mutual Becoming of Two Selves, a Continuous Evolution Within the Shared River of Existence.","Love, at its core, isn't merely a feeling; it's a resonance. A profound echo of existence between two souls, vibrating in a shared frequency. It's less about finding a ""missing piece"" and more about recognizing a parallel universe, a complementary constellation of stardust.
We often perceive love as a static state, a destination reached. But true love is a dynamic process, a constant becoming. It's the shared journey of two individuals evolving, not just alongside each other, but through each other. Think of Heraclitus's river: you can never step into the same river twice, and similarly, you can never truly experience the same love twice. It's in perpetual flux, shaped by shared experiences, vulnerabilities revealed, and the quiet understanding that transcends words.
Philosophy teaches us that the self is not a fixed entity. We are constantly being shaped by our interactions, our environment, and our internal dialogues. In a relationship, this shaping becomes a mutual dance. We influence, and are influenced, in a delicate balance. This is where the depth lies – in the willingness to be vulnerable, to allow another to see the raw, unfiltered you, and to reciprocate that vulnerability.
What should we do when we are in a relationship?
 * Embrace the Impermanence: Like all things, love is subject to change. Acknowledge this, and cherish the present moment. Instead of clinging to a fixed image of what love ""should"" be, allow it to unfold organically. For example, a couple who used to enjoy hiking may find their shared joy in cooking as they age.
 * Cultivate Mutual Growth: Encourage each other's passions, support each other's dreams, and challenge each other to become better versions of yourselves. Love isn't about stagnation; it's about shared evolution. One partner might inspire the other to pursue a long-dormant artistic passion, creating a space for shared creativity.
 * Practice Active Empathy: Listen not just with your ears, but with your heart. Strive to understand your partner's perspective, even when you disagree. Empathy is the bridge that connects two separate worlds. If one partner is experiencing work stress, the other seeks to understand the root of the stress, not just offer quick solutions.
 * Embrace the Paradox of Individuality and Unity: Love is not about merging into a single entity, but about celebrating the unique individuality of each person while simultaneously experiencing a profound sense of unity. Find the balance between ""I"" and ""We"". A couple might have separate hobbies, but they share a deep appreciation for the time they spend together.
 * Find the silence: In our modern world, filled with noise and distractions, finding moments of shared silence can be profoundly powerful. Sometimes, the deepest connections are forged in the quiet spaces between words. Sitting together watching a sunset, or enjoying a quiet morning coffee, can be more powerful than constant conversation.
 * Understand that conflict is not the opposite of love: Conflict, when handled correctly, can be a tool for deeper understanding. It allows us to see the places where our universes diverge, and to find ways to bridge those gaps. A disagreement about finances, when approached with open communication, can lead to a stronger shared understanding of each other's values.
Love, in its deepest sense, is a commitment to seeing and being seen, to understanding and being understood, to growing and growing together. It's the echo of existence, resonating in the shared space between two souls, forever changing, forever becoming.

1jgccbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jgccbs/something_sinister_lived_within_my_paintings/,Something Sinister Lived Within My Paintings,"‘Tom went mad,’ Gilbert said. ‘Schizophrenia or something, I think. He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*

*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-

\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*

*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at one of the photos I could swear the face in it had turned around to stare at me . I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*

*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*

*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*

*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim.

this is so stupid. this disorder is so goddam stupid.

i stopped counting cals a while ago. i said fuck it, i was so tired of it, i was so tired of being so obsessed with math like i’m a fucking computer science student. professor of malnutrition, if you will. 

whatever. 

you see, i was and continuing on undereating even when i ain’t counting no more. it’s like all this stress is for nothing at this point, cause when you’re not stressing about counting cals you’re stressing about NOT counting them. and, well, we aren’t doing half measures in this house. if i said fuck it i mean it. 

no more excuses. it’s not “oh i don’t want all this sugar” it’s actually “oh i don’t want all those calories”. it’s not “i want to mostly eat whole foods” it’s “i’m safe while i’m cooking for myself cause i have control”. it’s not about health. it’s about restriction. and deep down i know that. i know myself too damn well to let it slide.

and here where the protein bar does come into play in all of its glory. 

a few months ago i got it for the lunch. naive me, not having the full blown ana brain rot, didn’t bother checking the cals before going to the counter. though, while chewing it and having nothing better to do, i looked at those forbidden numbers on the back.

>!880.!< are you fucking kidding me? >!880!< calories in this pathetic size protein bar? at that point, i didn’t eat that much, so i wrapped it back, defeated. nah, i wasn’t about waisting my cals like that.

from there on, it was hiding in my pantry, waiting for the dark times. maybe for the next plague, when i’d need a quick energy or other fantasy scenario, cause i knew i wasn’t having it willingly otherwise.

until today. today i had my excuse of the breakfast. drank one cup of coffee. drank another one. came to the conclusion, that i was indeed restricting myself again. i had no energy. what do you do in this situation? you eat. 

that protein bar. my nemesis. 

the thoughts were running, all of them restrictive. if I had it, i’d need to walk more. to move somewhere, take my steps in. i’d need to have smaller dinner, maybe skip the lunch all together? maybe I’d rather have another bar, that granola one? maybe an apple? maybe another coffee?

maybe shut the fuck up and eat?

and so i did. ate it, half dry with typical chalky texture of a protein.

and you know what?

i looked at the back after i finished, at this fine font. i wanted to show myself, you see, you ate it, nothing happened. those >!880!< calories haven’t killed you.

this whole time, they weren’t calories. 

i looked at kj. 

i indeed was terrified by a >!210!< calories protein bar.

I think she was upset that I couldn’t be there. That day, I told her we should celebrate Valentine’s when we were both available, but unfortunately, my messages went unread.

On February 16th at 1 PM, I asked if I could visit her in her city (we were in a long-distance relationship, been dating for nearly 3 years). She declined, saying I would distract her from writing an essay. I was frustrated with her flakiness and, admittedly, I acted by not replying, mirroring the way she acts. I still think partly my mistake here was because I wasn’t being chill getting rejected, but still I wouldn’t get her attention anyway without doing this.

She freaked out, then sent me tons of messages, I didn’t reply. Then time skip into 11PM, I decided to reply to her saying I’m sorry that I was angry and so on. She then replied with “Do we need a break?”. Now, that isn’t what I expected to hear, but I respect her wishes and asked back “Is that what you want?”. Then, she didn’t reply back for an hour.

The thing is, we share our locations in Find My and suddenly I found out her location sharing was disabled exactly at midnight. At that time, I was panicking and cannot grasp the situation. I remembered that her Gmail account was still connected to my laptop browser, so I checked Google Maps. Her latest search history led to an unfamiliar flat, somewhere she had never been before. 

I was so infuriated as I didn’t expect she would outright deceived me, I wasn’t expecting she could do that at all. I started to panic and spam her calls and chats asking her whereabouts. She ignored all my calls but eventually texted back, claiming she was at a coffee shop working on her essay. If she did was, why bother turning of her location sharing?

I continue to spam call her until 2 AM. I got tired of doing so and at that point, I told her we were breaking up if she didn’t respond by morning. 

At 3 AM on February 17th, she finally called me. I confronted her, but she kept denying everything. The call was mostly silent as I was the only one speaking, freaking out, while she barely said a word. By the end of it, I broke her off and blocked her on all social media. She later reached out via iMessage, which I forgot to block, but instead of apologizing, she blamed and pointed out things she didn’t like about our relationship.

The next day, I was so devastated that I drank with my friends until I blacked out I woke up in my bed, not even knowing who had brought me home.

A week later, she reached out again, apologizing and asking to get back together. In response, I sent her a three-page PDF filled with questions about that night. Even until now at March, she hasn’t answered a single one. Instead, she asked to meet, and I agreed.

When she arrived at the café we planned to meet at, she was already in tears, unable to explain what really happened. It felt just like our last phone call, it was only me asking questions, while her staying silent and crying. In the end, she admitted that she had been in her colleague’s flat. She also had gone drinking with the same person while she was in Bangkok for an event back in November. I also discovered that she had been constantly chatting with this person on WhatsApp since January 7th, with disappearing messages turned on. It bothers me not knowing what kind of conversation they had. I didn’t like how she acts and the disrespect towards me. I just don’t understand why the need to hide these things, I never ever hid anything from her and never made her felt the need to compete just to get my attention.

I forgave her for what she did, but I told her that I couldn’t accept the way she hid things from me and that we couldn’t go back to the way things were. 

If we do get back, I will have a lower leverage in the relationship, I wont have any self-respect as I think she would do that again cause she’d think she can get to do anything if it’s with me. I will never forget the day she cheated on me, it was a traumatic experience.

————————————

Now I cant help but wonder if I didn’t find out, what would’ve happened? Everything on my mind is right now questions such as: what else does she lied about? How do I find peace? I feel like I no longer have confidence. I felt that I shouldn’t have had discovered her cheating.

I feel like I don’t have a proper closure and I would never get answers from her…

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Custom-fitted trays and professional-grade whitening gel allow you to achieve professional results in the comfort of your own home. These kits are more powerful than drugstore alternatives and provide consistent, even whitening.

u could've just told me kung ayaw mo na para hindi ako mukhang ewan dito. didn't even bother to say thanks. 

yk i was dumb for falling into ur trap, but i would greatly appreciate if u decide to unblock me (and my other accs na ik nakita mo na kasi i can't find ur dumb@ss username doon and u probably blocked me there so i have no means to reach out to you) and explain yourself. hindi 'yung feeling mature and firm ka when it comes to respecting my boundaries, pero ikaw rin 'tong biglang mawawala.

to be freaking honest, i am both anxious and mad at you right now for doing this to me. u said i might be the last one to experience your online kalandian and i really hope so, kasi i can't afford to imagine na may susunod pang babae na mabibiktima mo. sana tumigil ka na. you men and your audacity haha

1jgbw28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1jgbw28/my_free_time_as_an_aupair/,My Free time as an aupair,"Hello everyone!

People asked me here what l do during my free time.Here l want to share a little bit with you!

You know Being an au pair is a wild adventure. One minute, I’m helping a kid find their missing sock (which is always in the fridge for some reason), and the next minute, I’m answering questions like, “Why don’t fish wear shoes?” and “Can I marry a dinosaur?” (Answer: Only if the dinosaur says yes.)

But then, the weekend comes. The kids are off with their parents, and I’m free! No more refereeing toy car races. No more pretending I know all the words to Baby Shark. Just pure, glorious freedom. It’s like I’ve been released into the wild — except instead of running, I’m dramatically flopping on the couch like a tired seal.

And you know what my first mission is? The Baguette Quest.

 A fresh baguette is like the French version of a trophy. Every crunchy bite sounds like victory. I once bit into a baguette so perfectly crispy that I swear I heard angels sing.

But here’s the thing — a baguette is never just “a baguette.” It’s a meal, a hobby, and sometimes even a life partner. Some people do yoga for inner peace. I eat baguettes. Same result.

Butter and baguette? Classic. Cheese and baguette? A masterpiece. Peanut butter on a baguette? Bold. Dipping a baguette in Nutella? Now we’re talking. I once dipped it in ketchup😅. Was it weird? Yes. Did I regret it? Not immediately.

But my proudest moment? I invented something I call the “Baguette Buffet.” Basically, I take one baguette and dip it in everything I see. Hummus? Yes. Jam? Absolutely. Mustard? …Let’s not talk about that one. It was a dark time.

Of course, I don’t just eat baguettes all weekend. Sometimes I go out and explore Paris!

Paris is like a giant movie set — except instead of directors, there are pigeons. I walk down the street, and BAM! There’s the Eiffel Tower, just standing there like it owns the place. Sometimes I wave at it, just in case it waves back. Hasn’t happened yet, but I’m optimistic.

I love sitting in a café, sipping coffee like I’m in a fancy French film. I stare dramatically out the window, pretending I’m thinking deep thoughts like, “What is the meaning of life?” But really, I’m thinking, “Do I want another baguette?” (Spoiler: I always do.)

And museums? Oh, I love them. But sometimes I stare at the Mona Lisa and think, “You’d be happier with a baguette, Mona.” Imagine her holding a baguette instead of just sitting there, smiling mysteriously. Instant masterpiece.

But sometimes, I just stay in.

There’s nothing like a lazy day in my pyjamas, with no kids asking, “Why can’t we have a pet shark?” I tell myself I’ll read a book, but we all know I’m going to binge-watch a show instead. “Just one episode,” I say. Classic lie. Suddenly, it’s four hours later, and I’m emotionally invested in a series about a baking competition.

And then there’s the laundry. Oh, the laundry. I stare at it. It stares back. We have a silent agreement to ignore each other until the absolute last minute. Every time I fold socks, I narrate it like it’s a sports event:

""And she’s going for the matching pair! Will she find it? NO! Another rogue sock! The crowd is devastated!""

But the best part of the weekend? Knowing that when the kids come back, I’m ready. I’ve had my baguette therapy. I’ve had my quiet moments. I’m energized and prepared for all the “Why?” questions that are coming my way.

And to all the other au pairs out there, let me say this:

Don’t just sit at home on your weekends! This is your time. Get out there. Eat that baguette like you own the world. Stroll through the streets of Paris like you’re the star of a movie — even if the pigeons are the only ones watching. Visit the museums, wave at the Eiffel Tower, and sip that overpriced coffee in a tiny café just because you can.

Go make memories. Try that weird cheese. Take a thousand photos of the same pretty building. Get lost and laugh about it. And if you do decide to stay in? Make it worth it. Dance in your pyjamas, have a solo baguette feast, and binge-watch that show guilt-free.

You work hard all week — now live it up. Because when Monday comes, and the kids are back with their endless energy and curious questions, you’ll be glad you spent your weekend laughing, exploring, and enjoying every moment.

So, to all my fellow au pairs: Your weekends are your own. Make them delicious, adventurous, and absolutely unforgettable. And remember — a baguette is always a good idea.

Thank you, and may your weekends be as amazing as you are!",4,1742544882.0,Aupairs,2,0.67,False
