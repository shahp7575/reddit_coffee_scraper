I let him know early on that I was seeing someone, and then let him know a couple months later when that ended.

We go out for coffee or brunch about every other week. He’s not dating anyone, and he knows I’m not either. Our conversations are always nice, but we rarely talk about dating or out pasts. I recently mentioned wanting a lover thinking he’d put 2 and 2 together and make a move, but he hasn’t. 

He’s on the quiet side, not a player and I don’t get the sense he’s got game. I know he wants to find someone, but don’t believe he’s actively looking or on the apps. 

I’m used to guys making the first move, but I feel like with him I’ll have to do it. I don’t know if I should just try to kiss him, be embarrassingly direct and ask if he’d like to mess around, or maybe use alcohol to adjust the vibe. We have been friends (without sexual innuendos) for quite some time which is making me feel super uncomfortable about how to approach him. More recently, I’ve tried to say flirty or complimentary things to him, but don’t feel like he’s getting it.

I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.


I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place… let’s just say I could write a separate story on that alone.


By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.


The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me—bought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me a great salary.


The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I’d be happy here for a long time.


But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.


However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.


I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place… let’s just say I could write a separate story on that alone.


By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.


The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me—bought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me a great salary.


The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I’d be happy here for a long time.


But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.


However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.


I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place… let’s just say I could write a separate story on that alone.


By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.


The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me—bought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me a great salary.


The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I’d be happy here for a long time.


But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.


However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.


I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place… let’s just say I could write a separate story on that alone.


By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.


The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me—bought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me a great salary.


The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I’d be happy here for a long time.


But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.


However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

Our relationship has been rocky since she got with her now husband 5 years ago. Basically they met while I was in school and from the moment I came home to visit he didn’t like me. He also quit his job within a month of getting with my mom. He was trying to get disability for 4 years and failed (rightfully). So my mom has been supporting him their whole relationship. She bought the house they are in as well. His hatred has grown for me over the years and he is always trying to cause problems in our family. He will message my sister disgusting lies about me and my mom, post about me on social media, had his daughter threaten to beat me up. Just a very immature 50 something year old man. He recently has been getting more unhinged and had an outburst inside of a children’s play canter because I bought my mom a Starbucks coffee. He cussed us out and said my mom was holding him hostage because she wouldn’t let him take her car and leave. Financially my mom is struggling more than ever. Me and my partner have been letting her borrow money all summer. She’s short for pretty much all her bills. She’d rather keep taking money from us then make her husband get a job. It’s very frustrating watching her struggle for years when she has a good job and should be financially stable. I’m tired of her stresses that’s she chooses being my stress. She is letting the man take all of her money and treat us all like crap for 5 years.

I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.


I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place… let’s just say I could write a separate story on that alone.


By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.


The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me—bought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me a great salary.


The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I’d be happy here for a long time.


But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.


However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

I got a living room setup connected to an LG OLED that I use as my main display. However I wanted a little 1080p monitor I could put on my coffee table and hook up to my Steam Deck, so my wife and I could play lan games together in the living room comfortably. 

Ended up settling on the best budget display from Microcenter that didn't burn my retnas. An Acer ""AOPEN"" 22CV1Q for $70 US. The definition of nothing fancy, but its got good colors and runs at 100hz. It also has no speakers which requires me to use headphones. And given my only headphones I have is a set of noise cancelling Corsair's, thats a small problem for couch CO-OP.

Naturally after any impulse purchase I start seeing what could've been better options left and right. The one that caught my eye was the MSI PRO MP252 E2 for $100. But I'm having trouble finding info on it?  Most of what I can find is on the MP251 E2, and I can't even find what makes that different? I was wondering if anybody with some first hand experience could tell me if this is worth trading up to?

First, display size makes no difference to me, I was just fine with 21"", same with refresh rate. I wouldn't mind 120hz but it's not worth $30 to me. My main concerns are the internal speakers, how well the display tilts, the color range (nothings gonna look good next to my OLED but it should try) and HDR. 

I hear the speakers are crap, but crap is a relative term. Do they sound like the audio is playing through an answering machine? Or is it just a little quiet? It doesn't  need full stereo seperation i just need to hear if I'm about to be attacked.

 As far as the HDR, when I'm not playing CO-OP I do sometimes stream my main PC to my Deck and play games that way, actual big boy games like Cyberpunk and DOOM, so having HDR wouldn't hurt. However I can't find the peak HDR brightness listed ANYWHERE. Which tells me its so minimal it's not worth talking about. Can anyone confirm this? 

If you were in my shoes would you trade up? Or would you stick with what you got and grab a cheap pair of speakers and call it a day? Is there an undisclosed  third option that would work better for me? Thank you for your time! Appreciate you reading through my rambling!",1,1752466892.0,Monitors,1,1.0,False
1lzcytm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokerface/comments/1lzcytm/how_i_wish_alexs_story_had_been_written/,How I Wish Alex's Story Had Been Written,"I wanna preface this by saying I love the show, I like the last few episodes including the finale, and I think the writers on the whole are very talented. 

My main problem with the Alex reveal (yes, like many others, I saw it coming, but it's still a reveal within the show) is not any of the plot holes people have pointed out, though those do annoy me to a degree; my problem is that, as shown, Alex's normal method of killing people doesn't involve lying. She walked through the antarctic on foot and infiltrated the base using physical prowess, not guile.

I think it would have been more interesting, and thematically relevant, if Alex had been the shape-shifting assassin. Maybe she's planning to take on Charlie's face to get to Hasp but first she needs to learn Charlie's mannerisms, so she befriends her. In the finale, she thinks she's killed Charlie and assumes her identity but Charlie's alive and in the end, it comes down to Luca with his gun trained on two Charlies; he realises which one he needs to shoot because he lies and Charlie doesn't call bullshit. Alex can still live and get away and stuff, I just think this would have been more in step with the show's themes.

I also think it could have been more fun if Alex had had to learn to lie to Charlie. I think the first interaction could have gone like this:

ALEX: Hi, they made me two coffees by accident
CHARLIE: Bullshit.
ALEX: You're right, I'm sorry, I just wanted an excuse to talk to you. [Technically not a lie.]

As they interact more, Alex starts telling fewer lies from Charlie's perspective, but it's actually that Alex has learnt how Charlie's power works and is compensating for it.

I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but it was just something I thought of.

""My birthday wish is for Phoebe to be my mommy,"" Estela Leon heard her daughter Rowena Leon say from behind the door.

She clutched her mouth, trying to muffle the sobs that broke out-Phoebe Silva was her husband Vance Leon's mistress.

She had already stolen Vance. Now, she wanted to take her children too.

But today was Rowena's birthday. Estela didn't want to ruin the celebration.

She wiped away her tears and stepped into the room with a gift. Rowena, who loved looking pretty, pulled away the moment she reached to touch her head.

""And Mommy, you have a cold. Stay away from me-don't mess up my hair. Phoebe did these braids. If they get messed up, she'll be upset.""

Estela watched Rowena and her son Josh Leon excitedly talk about making clothes for Phoebe. In the corner, a little doll meant to be ""Mommy"" lay forgotten, tossed aside.

Her chest tightened, and a bitter taste spread in her mouth.

She had been in a secret marriage with Vance for three years. To everyone else, Phoebe was seen as his rightful wife.

But after just a few months apart, even her own children-flesh and blood-now seemed to prefer another woman.

Estela lowered her eyes and stood in silence for a long while, only heading upstairs to shower and rest when the housekeeper quietly reminded her.

Just then, Vance's secretary arrived. He paused for a moment, surprised to see her.

""Ma'am, Mr. Leon won't be coming home tonight. He asked me to pick up the gift he prepared for Ms. Silva,"" the secretary said.

""Alright,"" Estela said softly.

Once the secretary left, a sharp pain shot through her chest.

He remembered to prepare a gift for Phoebe-but not once had he ever given her anything.

She dialed a video call.

It connected quickly.

""What is it?""

The screen showed Vance's private lounge.

Elegant, luxurious, bathed in dazzling light-every inch oozed the extravagance that Zrefast was known for.

He wore a six-figure tailored suit, held a wine glass, and lounged casually on the sofa.

There was nothing calculating about him-just cool elegance. His expression was calm, aloof, and untouchable, like frost or snow. He was the kind of man people dreamed of but could never reach.

Estela had loved him for six whole years.

Her voice softened. ""It's been a while since we saw each other. Tonight, maybe-""

""Vance-""

Before she could finish, a soft, feminine voice chimed in on his end.

It was Phoebe.

The call cut off immediately.

Just before the screen went black, Vance said simply, ""We'll talk later.""

Estela tightened her grip on the phone, staring out at the towering skyline beyond the window.

Cars streamed through the streets like rivers of light. The city shimmered-so bright and beautiful it almost didn't seem real.

Her husband, Vance, controlled a financial empire and moved markets with ease. But for her-his wife-he had no warmth, no time, no care.

Six years, and he'd never changed. Always cold. Always distant.

Behind every kind word or gentle look was a wall she could never get past.

She'd spent all these years trying to win back his heart.

But in that moment, for the very first time-Estela felt something shift. She was tired.

Estela didn't call him back. She drifted into a restless, heavy sleep.

The next day, Vance finally sent a message: \[Sorry. Happy third anniversary.\]

Then another: \[This is to make up for it.\]

Not long after, a bank alert came through-an eight-figure deposit.

She scrolled past the messages, just as a notification popped up from Phoebe's social media.

\[A custom-made diamond ring from Egoset-eight months in the making. A once-in-a-lifetime piece. Thank you, Mr. Leon.\]

In the post, Phoebe was all smiles, radiant and charming. A dazzling diamond sparkled on her pale, delicate hand.

Dressed in a rose-red gown, she posed beneath a famous tower, the fabric swirling around her like wine. The whole image screamed luxury, decadence-and intention.

Estela suddenly remembered the day before she married Vance.

It was in the family's quiet, old estate. He'd walked past her along the corridor. His eyes were calm, unreadable-but they had seen straight through her illusions.

He said, ""I'll marry you. But that's all.""

Back then, she'd thought the line ""I want love, not money"" sounded childish-naive, even.

But now, for the first time, she got it.

For six years, she'd chased a fantasy-thinking all she wanted was his love.

And she'd never had it.

She forced down the emotions building inside her and quietly went downstairs.

In the garden, she heard Rowena's innocent, sing-song voice, laced with a hint of complaint. ""Why did Mommy come back? Phoebe promised to take us to see the bear ballet today. I wish Mommy just never came back.""

Chapter 2

""Yeah,"" Josh said softly, eyes downcast. ""Billy said Daddy only married Mommy because he couldn't marry Phoebe. Mommy's pretty, but I still like Phoebe more.""

The words hit Estela like ice water down her spine-sharp, sudden, cruel.

'He couldn't marry her?' she thought.

The shock took a moment to fade, and when it did, her heart felt hollow.

She looked at her children.

She'd nearly died giving birth to them-both times. Complications, hemorrhaging.

They'd been weak, sickly babies, and she'd cared for them around the clock. Barely slept, barely ate. It ruined her health.

Then something happened in Zrefast. Vance's father Reggie Leon fell gravely ill.

Vance went back to take charge-and brought the kids with him.

Since then, she'd been traveling back and forth between two cities. But every time she came back, the children seemed farther and farther away.

She didn't even remember how she got back to her room.

The kids had private lessons scheduled. The nanny took them out.

Even with everything on her plate, Estela messaged Vance again to ask for a meeting.

She was his wife. Whether it was about the kids or about Phoebe, she had every right to demand answers.

But he brushed her off with a single line. ""I have something important. Let's talk tomorrow night.""

There was no way to describe the bitterness welling up inside her.

She left the house without thinking and wandered to the place where she and Vance had first met-an old amusement park.

It was small, tucked away in a corner of the city.

Just as she stepped in and approached the Ferris wheel, she heard a familiar little voice. ""Phoebe, I want to ride the Ferris wheel!""

""Okay, I'll go get the tickets.""

Estela looked up-and there they were.

Not far away, Phoebe and Vance, each holding one of her children's hands. They looked, unmistakably, like a perfect family.

Soon, Estela heard her children's voices. ""You're the best. I want to be with you forever.""

Phoebe laughed softly, teasing, ""If your mom hears that, she won't be happy.""

""I don't like her. Why should I care if she's mad?""

The words hit Estela like a blast of arctic wind.

She stood frozen, watching in silence as Vance and her children walked hand in hand with Phoebe into the Ferris wheel.

The man she had loved for six years. The children she had brought into the world.

Without another moment's hesitation, Estela turned and walked away.

She'd been holding on for six years-it was time to let go.

Back at the old house, she quietly packed up all of her belongings.

Then she sent Vance one final message: \[Have the divorce papers ready.\]

She left her wedding ring on the nightstand, walked out without a backward glance, and called a cab to the airport.

\*\*\*\*\*

After leaving the church, Vance returned to the old house with the children.

The area outside the church was packed. Just as he was about to check his phone, someone shouted-

""Stop! Thief!""

A commotion erupted.

The bodyguards instinctively moved to shield him, but in the chaos, Phoebe was shoved forward-right into Vance's arms.

His phone slipped from his hand, crashed to the ground, and was crushed under the stampede of feet.

""Vance, I'm so sorry-your phone."" she said.

He frowned briefly, then said calmly, ""It's fine. I'll get another one.""

The phone was mostly used to keep in touch with family anyway.

Not that anyone in the Leon family texted much. If anyone messaged him at all, it was usually Estela.

But her messages had never seemed urgent.

\*\*\*\*\*

On the way home, the kids were buzzing with excitement.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve, eyes sparkling. ""Daddy, is Phoebe really going to stay with us soon? She promised to take me to Candyland!""

Even Josh looked hopeful.

""Yes,"" Vance nodded.

But Josh hesitated, frowning slightly. ""But Daddy. Mommy said we're not very healthy, and the air at Candyland might make us sick. She didn't want us to go. Won't Mommy be upset if she finds out Phoebe's moving in?""

Vance responded gently, ""Phoebe is trained in medicine. She once saved Daddy's life. With her here, you'll both be fine. Your mommy won't be staying long anyway. Phoebe's just visiting for a while to help take care of you.""

The kids had always been frail. Having Phoebe around might actually do them some good.

""Yay!"" They both shouted in delight as they arrived home.

But the moment they stepped inside, they found something that made them even happier-Estela had gone back to Trurgh.

Vance noticed the wedding ring placed neatly on the nightstand and paused, mildly surprised.

Ever since they got married, no matter how badly they fought, Estela had never taken off that ring.

Chapter 3

Now she had left without a word-and taken the ring off, too.

'Is she upset again? Feeling neglected?' he thought.

Estela had always been gentle and soft-spoken-like most women from Trurgh, traditional and reserved. No matter how coldly he treated her, she never pushed back.

'Well, even the calmest person has a breaking point,' he thought.

Still, Vance didn't take it too seriously.

He tossed the ring aside without a second thought.

""Mrs. Leon won't be coming back for a while. Pack up her things. Clean out the room-Ms. Silva will be moving in soon,"" he ordered.

Rowena and Josh's eyes instantly lit up.

'Now that Mom is gone, Phoebe can finally move in,' they thought.

'And no one would be breathing down our necks anymore-asking the doctors endless questions about our physical activity.'

'Mom always makes such a big deal out of everything. She insists we meet our monthly exercise quotas and hovers over us every time she comes home.'

""It's just a pity,"" Josh muttered gloomily. ""Mom said she'd help us finish building that spaceship. It's super hard.""

The puzzle had thousands of tiny pieces. Once completed, it would become an intricate model of a spaceship. Josh had been planning to give it to Phoebe as a birthday gift.

But it was exhausting and hard on the eyes-he'd been waiting for Estela to help.

Rowena pouted too. ""She was supposed to finish sewing clothes for my doll before she left.""

Every time Estela came back, she'd make a whole new wardrobe for the dolls. Phoebe always said how good Estela was at picking fabrics and matching colors.

But this time, Estela left so suddenly that the clothes weren't ready.

Now Phoebe wouldn't see them, and there'd be no compliments.

Estela wasn't as fun or glamorous as Phoebe, but when it came to fiddly little projects like this-she was actually really good.

\*\*\*\*\*

Meanwhile, in Trurgh-miles away-Estela returned to the home she once shared with Vance.

After he moved back to Zrefast with the kids, Estela had stayed behind. Officially, it was for work, but in truth, it was mostly to care for his parents.

Reggie had long settled in Zrefast, but the rest of the family had moved to Trurgh over a decade ago.

High society in Zrefast had its own rigid rules-everything from dress codes to dinner etiquette was micromanaged.

Rosalyn Leon never got along with Reggie and had no interest in returning to that life. She was used to being pampered and calling the shots-and preferred life in Trurgh, where things went her way.

The Leon family wasn't fond of women who were too outspoken or ambitious, so for Vance's sake, Estela had kept a low profile and stayed behind as the dutiful daughter-in-law.

Her job at Leon Group had always been in name only.

But now that she had made up her mind to divorce Vance, none of that mattered anymore.

She packed up everything in their marital home and prepared to hand over the keys.

Just as she came downstairs, suitcase in hand, the butler happened to see her.

""Mrs. Leon, you're back. Rosalyn mentioned she was craving that fish soup you made last time.""

But when he saw the luggage, he froze mid-sentence.

Estela handed him the house keys.

""I won't be living here anymore,"" she said with a faint smile. ""If she wants soup, tell her to hire a chef.""

Without waiting for a response, Estela turned and walked out-ignoring the butler's stunned expression.

That night, Rosalyn didn't get her fish soup.

\*\*\*\*\*

Later that evening, Vance video-called Rosalyn. She didn't waste time voicing her discontent.

""Honestly, you never should've married a woman from Trurgh. Can't even cook a simple dish of fish soup,"" she said.

He looked mildly surprised.

Estela had always been respectful and compliant, especially toward elders. Her defiance this time? Unexpected.

""It's just a dish,"" he said indifferently. ""If she won't make it, get someone else who will.""

Rosalyn looked uncomfortable.

Truth be told, she'd already tried hiring several chefs-but none of them could get it quite right. Not like Estela did.

Still, she couldn't admit that in front of her son. She muttered a vague reply and left it at that.

Off to the side, the butler hesitated, unsure whether to say anything about Estela moving out of the house.

""Mr. Leon. Mrs. Leon, she. she's moved out.""

He barely got the words out before Vance cut him off, voice cold and flat. ""Forget it. Leave her alone.""

Vance ended the call without a second thought.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office overlooking Zrefast, a faint trace of annoyance flickered across his otherwise impeccable face.

He glanced at his newly replaced phone, but in the end, didn't call the contact at the top of his list.

Chapter 4

Back at the church, both his phone and SIM card had been destroyed.

At first, he'd intended to let Estela know-she was still his wife, after all.

But lately, it seemed all the special treatment he'd given her over the years had gone to her head.

A little lesson wouldn't hurt.

Unaware of any of this, Estela slept soundly through the night.

The next morning, she returned to the Leon Group and submitted her resignation.

It went through without a hitch.

When Vance had placed her in the company, it was a low-level, nominal role. No one really knew her true identity.

So once she completed her handover, she could leave cleanly.

When word got out, a coworker remarked with a knowing smile, ""Must be for your kids, huh? They're what, four? Five? That age clings to their mom like glue. You always had their pictures on your desk-and that necklace with their little faces on it. You've always treated them like treasures.""

Estela paused.

She had loved Vance-deeply. And naturally, she loved the two children they had together. Even now, separated by cities, she still cared deeply for Rowena and Josh.

But.

She shook her head, offering a small smile. ""It's not about them.""

And that was the truth.

The Leon Group was massive and well-connected internationally, but its focus-construction and real estate-was never her passion.

Before, as Vance's wife, she hadn't questioned it. The expectations from the Leon family left little room for her own ambitions.

But now that she had chosen to leave him, she needed to choose her own future.

Her gaze drifted to her phone, where a headline flashed across the screen. \[National Heritage Expo: The Fragrant Arts.\]

Perfume blending. Coffee ceremony. Modern reinterpretations of traditional craftsmanship.

Something about it caught her eye.

Without hesitation, she texted her cousin, Wilford Warren: \[Any chance you can get me a ticket to this event?\]

He responded almost instantly. \[Of course. But aren't you always too busy? Between the Leon family and the kids, when do you ever have time for this kind of thing?\]

\[I do now.\] Estela replied calmly. \[I'm divorced.\]

There was a pause.

\[Wait-seriously?\] Wilford's response came with a stunned breath. \[You actually divorced into that Leon family?\]

The same Leon family who had built a private rooftop amusement park in the heart of Zrefast-just for their grandchildren. No outsiders allowed.

Back when Estela's parents died, the only reason the Leon family even considered the marriage was because her grandfather Keven Warren had once done them a great favor.

Otherwise, no way would they have let Vance marry the daughter of a university professor.

Even if that professor's father was none other than Keven-the renowned scholar of classical arts.

\[If it doesn't feel right, walk away.\] Estela replied lightly, with a smile.

Wilford couldn't tell if he admired her courage or pitied her choices. Maybe a bit of both.

Wilford: \[But... what about Rowena and Josh? Can you really let them go?\]

Estela glanced at her phone.

When the kids had moved back to Zrefast, she'd made sure they each had a phone-just in case they missed her and wanted to call.

But over the past year, unless she reached out first, neither of them had ever called her.

They had everything now: a powerful family name, a life of privilege. and a woman they already saw as their mother.

'So why should I keep clinging to a connection that only exists in blood?' she wondered.

\*\*\*\*\*

Back in Zrefast, inside the Leon family's estate, the nutritionist gently reminded the children, ""Josh, Rowena, did you forget what Ms. Warren said? No being picky with food. Your bodies are still fragile-you need a balanced intake of fat to grow up healthy. And no overdoing it with sweets.""

Josh hesitated, looking uncertain.

But Rowena waved it off like it was nothing.

""Mom already missed her check-in call! She won't know anything. Besides, Phoebe said kids should be happy! And right now, the thing that makes me happiest is eating all these cupcakes!""

Just then, a light laugh floated down from upstairs.

Phoebe came down, smiling as she walked over and gently tapped Rowena on the forehead. ""You little troublemaker. Alright-whatever Rowena and Josh want, they can have.""

""Yay! Phoebe, you're the best! I wish you could stay with us forever!""

Their innocent cheers made Phoebe's smile deepen.

The nutritionist frowned. She opened her mouth to object, but when her gaze landed on Phoebe, she hesitated-and fell silent.

At first, she had assumed Estela was the lady of the house. But now it was clear: Phoebe moved around the Leon family like she belonged. The kids were clearly attached to her.

If she upset Phoebe, it might not sit well with Vance.

Josh, meanwhile, was conflicted.

Chapter 5

Last time he ignored Estela's advice, he ended up really sick.

Phoebe was sweet, and he did like her-but Estela had warned him that if he kept eating recklessly, he'd get seriously ill again, and Vance would be worried too.

He didn't want to cause either of them stress. So as he ate, he held back, choosing more carefully.

Rowena, however, wasn't as cautious. She ate too much-mixing cold and hot foods, creamy desserts, and sugary treats. By nightfall, she was doubled over in pain.

Curled up on her bed, she trembled from the stomach cramps. Her soft, pale face looked pitiful, flushed and tear-streaked.

When Vance heard Rowena wasn't feeling well, he rushed home immediately.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve with teary eyes and a trembling voice.

""Daddy. did I get sick because I was bad? Did Mommy punish me with a stomachache? She said if I ate too many cupcakes again, a witch would curse me. I didn't mean to. I want Mommy to come back and undo the spell."" she said.

More than anything, she missed how Estela would always make her warm soup whenever she was feeling sick.

Now, all she could do was cry, a mess of tears and runny nose.

Beside them, Phoebe bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Vance, I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying close enough attention. I let Rowena eat too many sweets.""

Rowena quickly jumped to her defense, worried her father might be upset with Phoebe. ""Daddy, it's not her fault! It's because Mommy forgot to call me! She doesn't care about me anymore.""

Josh blinked in confusion. Thankfully, he'd remembered what Estela said last time he got sick.

Even if Estela didn't laugh and play like Phoebe, she always paid close attention when it came to their health.

Still, since Phoebe was always so kind, he couldn't help but speak up for her too.

""Daddy. Mommy used to remind us a lot. Rowena's still little-she just forgets things sometimes.""

""Understood,"" Vance said, his tone a bit firmer now. ""From now on, both of you need to follow the nutritionist's instructions. No more sneaking snacks.""

He didn't blame Phoebe for what happened. In fact, he found himself even more frustrated with Estela.

'Isn't this exactly what she is supposed to be doing? She used to handle all of Rowena's meals and routines,' he thought.

But now that she couldn't even be bothered to check in properly, Rowena had gotten sick. As far as he saw it, this was on her.

Estela had no idea Rowena had been sick.

That Sunday, she still thought to check in and called the kids over video chat.

She was their mother, after all. Even if the emotional bond wasn't what it used to be, she still had a duty to them.

When the call came through, Rowena and Josh were busy helping Phoebe try on evening gowns.

In just a few days, Reggie would be discharged from the hospital.

Normally, that would mean Vance had no reason to stay in Zrefast and would head back to Trurgh to continue expanding the business.

But the idea of returning made the twins visibly glum.

They weren't ready to see Estela again. And they definitely didn't want to leave Phoebe.

Seeing their downcast faces, Phoebe smiled and gently ruffled their hair. ""Hmm. let me guess. Why are my little prince and princess so upset?""

She paused dramatically. ""Is it because we're heading back to Trurgh? I thought you'd be excited to see your mom again.""

Rowena's eyes welled with tears. She pouted and mumbled, ""What's so great about seeing Mom? We don't want to leave you.""

Josh nodded. He did miss Estela a little, but the thought of parting with Phoebe made him hesitate.

""Well then,"" Phoebe said with a playful glint in her eye, ""I have some good news.""

She let the suspense hang for a second, then smiled.

""I've got work to do in Trurgh. I'll be staying there for quite a while-so I'll be coming with you!""

""Really?"" Rowena lit up, cheering with joy. If Phoebe was coming to Trurgh too, then everything would be perfect.

Right at that moment, Estela's video call came through.

The ringtone echoed a few times. Rowena stared at the screen, then deliberately let it ring out before hanging up.

Estela called again. And again.

Annoyed, Rowena finally blocked the number.

Phoebe chuckled and gave her a gentle poke on the forehead but didn't scold her. ""Rowena, why didn't you answer your mom's call?""

""She didn't call me the other day on purpose, and I got sick. She's so mean-I don't want to talk to her!"" Rowena pouted.

Besides, they'd be going back to Trurgh soon. She'd see Estela then anyway.

And if Estela found out Phoebe was moving in, she'd definitely be upset.

Chapter 6

Rowena didn't want anyone messing with her and Phoebe's time together.

Phoebe pinched her cheek with a warm smile. ""As long as our little princess is happy, that's all that matters.""

Josh had a fleeting sense that something about all this wasn't quite right. But when he saw the calm expression on Phoebe's face, his doubt faded.

Vance always said Phoebe was special-not like other women.

And if she didn't think Rowena had done anything wrong, then maybe it really wasn't a big deal.

Besides, they'd be seeing Estela again soon anyway.

On the other end of the line, Estela stared at the red exclamation mark on her phone screen, stunned.

This was a phone she had specially set up just for the twins.

No one else used it. No one else had access.

She'd known their relationship had grown distant since they'd gone to Zrefast-but she never imagined they would block her.

Still worried, she called the housekeeper at the villa, the one in charge of the children's daily care.

""Ma'am, the children are doing great,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""Right now they're helping Ms. Silva try on dresses.""

The mention of ""Ms. Silva"" hit Estela like a pin to the chest.

Those were her children-children she had nearly died bringing into this world.

And now, they were looking to another woman for comfort and care.

""As long as they're okay,"" she replied quietly.

She didn't bring up the fact that her children had blocked her.

She knew their personalities-spoiled since birth, prone to sulking. Blocking her was just another form of acting out.

If this had happened before, she might have kept calling. Again and again. Refusing to give up.

But now. she found she no longer had the energy.

As long as they were safe and healthy, that was enough.

Whether or not they still saw her as their mother-that was no longer something she could control.

Two days later, Reggie was discharged from the hospital.

Vance soon made the decision to return to Trurgh and expand the Leon Group's presence there.

Before leaving, Rowena and Josh said their goodbyes to classmates at school.

The farewell gifts were chosen by Phoebe.

But the kids who received them didn't seem all that thrilled.

""Barbies and toy cars? These are kinda old now,"" one of their closest friends muttered. ""I liked those teddy bear cakes your mom made way better. Why didn't you bring those?""

Rowena pressed her lips together.

Those teddy bear cakes were Estela's specialty. They were complicated to make-Estela had burned her hands several times trying to get them just right.

But Phoebe didn't know how to make them. 'If only Mom were here.' Rowena thought.

Josh looked down too.

Ever since Rowena had blocked Estela's number, she hadn't called them once.

He hadn't heard her voice in what felt like forever-and honestly, he kind of missed her.

Still, he'd be seeing her soon.

But if Estela was back, that probably meant less time with Phoebe.

Vance had no idea what the kids were thinking.

When the housekeeper called to inform him, she said, ""Sir, Mrs. Leon hasn't been back to the villa for over a week. Would you like us to let her know you're returning?""

He frowned. His tone cooled immediately. ""No need. If she's not coming back, then clear out the master bedroom. I'll be moving in there with Rowena, Josh, and Phoebe.""

In the past, he'd only stayed in the marital home when visiting the children.

But since Estela insisted on giving him the cold shoulder, she had no business returning to that house.

Meanwhile, back in Trurgh, Estela had moved into her old apartment and started growing flowers on the balcony.

She wasn't particularly skilled at gardening, but maybe it was the peace of being on her own-or simply being free from her marriage-that made everything feel lighter.

Her neighbor, Cleveland, was quick to scold whenever he saw her plants. ""Girl, if you don't know how to grow flowers, stop drowning them! They're about to keel over!"" he'd grumble, beard twitching with annoyance.

After stepping in to rescue the plants himself, another neighbor pulled Estela aside, smiling apologetically.

""Don't mind the old man-he's been extra cranky lately. Word is his grandson's refusing to get married, and they had a big falling out. He stormed off and moved in here to cool down.""

Estela just smiled.

The Leon family had been steeped in strict rules and formality. She'd spent years tiptoeing around, doing everything to please them.

Cleveland might be grumpy and old-fashioned, but with his help, gardening suddenly felt more manageable.

Over time, the two formed an unexpected friendship, one that felt strangely comforting.

That evening, Estela got a message from Delia Allison, her senior from university.

Chapter 7

When Delia learned Estela would be attending the National Heritage Expo, she immediately suggested they go together.

Estela had studied design in college-sharp, creative, and full of fresh ideas. She had once joined Delia's design studio under the pseudonym Smile, contributing to several dazzling, standout projects.

But after marrying into the Leon family, she'd quietly stepped away.

Delia's studio, meanwhile, had steadily risen to prominence. It was no surprise she'd been invited to such a major industry event.

When Estela arrived, Delia was already surrounded by admirers, navigating the room like a star.

In recent years, she'd made quite a name for herself, with a strong presence in the design world.

People gravitated toward her effortlessly, eager to introduce themselves, eager to be seen.

A successful woman always shone brightest-men, in contrast, felt more like props in the background.

Estela watched from a distance and lowered her gaze.

For years, she had poured her heart into Vance and their children-so much so, she had nearly forgotten who she used to be.

'Could I still be that bold, brilliant designer I once was?' she wondered.

Just as the thought surfaced, Delia made her way over.

""This year's expo is really something. A lot of new talent showing up,"" she said with a knowing smile. ""Watching them today reminded me of you. Back when I tried to keep you at Allison Group-it's a shame how things turned out.""

Allison Group had been the name of Delia's college startup-the predecessor to her current firm.

Estela gave a small, bittersweet smile. ""Allison Group's doing just fine without me.""

In the world of design, fresh talent emerged constantly. No one could stay on top forever.

Besides, she hadn't been part of that world for years.

""I don't agree,"" Delia said, lighting a cigarette and finally saying what she'd been holding in all these years.

Estela looked up when she heard the words, her long lashes fluttering slightly as she gazed at the artwork on display.

Delia raised an eyebrow. ""The Rangel Group has been focused on developing a modern aesthetic these past couple of years - from jewelry to fashion. That just happens to be your area of expertise. Estela, I need you.""

Estela was no stranger to the Rangel Group.

In recent years, it had expanded rapidly, especially in traditional industries.

Its head, Wesley Rangel, though young, had already earned a reputation for being ruthless and calculating, with a sharp eye for the future.

It didn't surprise Estela that Delia was trying to team up with the Rangel Group to carve out a space in the design market.

'But... could I really go back to that world?' she wondered.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, a cold, aloof voice called out from nearby. ""Estela? Shouldn't you be taking care of Mom? What are you doing here?""

It was Thelma Leon- Vance's younger sister, and a star student at Choross University.

Ever since Estela married into the Leon family, Thelma had kept her at arm's length.

She had nothing but disdain for women like Estela - women who relied on men, buried themselves in housework, and, in her eyes, had no real worth.

Estela hadn't expected to run into her here.

She didn't offer much explanation. ""Just came to take a look.""

""These pieces have significant artistic value,"" Thelma said coolly. ""Even the simplest design here is probably beyond your understanding. My brother, Josh and Rowena will be back soon. You'd be better off focusing on them.""

To her, Estela was nothing special. Sure, she'd heard that Estela had a decent education and some design talent before marrying in, but in the end, she was just another woman who landed on her feet by marrying well. 'What real ability could she possibly have?' she wondered.

Estela stood frozen for a moment. 'Vance is coming back?' she thought.

Her fingers curled slightly, a trace of bitterness rising in her chest.

Even though they were getting divorced, he was returning with the child - and he hadn't even bothered to tell her.

In his eyes, the woman who had once been Mrs. Leon really didn't matter at all.

Thelma, never one for small talk with Estela, was about to leave when something crossed her mind - the fish soup Rosalyn had been craving.

""Oh, right,"" she said offhandedly. ""If you've got time, make some of that fish soup. You're not exactly busy, and your cooking's still passable.""

In the past, Estela would've agreed without a second thought.

Back then, she'd done everything she could to win the Leon family's approval. No matter how complicated the request, if Rosalyn asked for it, she'd make it happen.

But now? She didn't care anymore.

1lzcu95,https://i.redd.it/oeb2urdrlrcf1.png,"Revenge on My Hateful Husband | Just as the thought crossed her mind, a cold, aloof voice called out from nearby.","Chapter 1

""My birthday wish is for Phoebe to be my mommy,"" Estela Leon heard her daughter Rowena Leon say from behind the door.

She clutched her mouth, trying to muffle the sobs that broke out-Phoebe Silva was her husband Vance Leon's mistress.

She had already stolen Vance. Now, she wanted to take her children too.

But today was Rowena's birthday. Estela didn't want to ruin the celebration.

She wiped away her tears and stepped into the room with a gift. Rowena, who loved looking pretty, pulled away the moment she reached to touch her head.

""And Mommy, you have a cold. Stay away from me-don't mess up my hair. Phoebe did these braids. If they get messed up, she'll be upset.""

Estela watched Rowena and her son Josh Leon excitedly talk about making clothes for Phoebe. In the corner, a little doll meant to be ""Mommy"" lay forgotten, tossed aside.

Her chest tightened, and a bitter taste spread in her mouth.

She had been in a secret marriage with Vance for three years. To everyone else, Phoebe was seen as his rightful wife.

But after just a few months apart, even her own children-flesh and blood-now seemed to prefer another woman.

Estela lowered her eyes and stood in silence for a long while, only heading upstairs to shower and rest when the housekeeper quietly reminded her.

Just then, Vance's secretary arrived. He paused for a moment, surprised to see her.

""Ma'am, Mr. Leon won't be coming home tonight. He asked me to pick up the gift he prepared for Ms. Silva,"" the secretary said.

""Alright,"" Estela said softly.

Once the secretary left, a sharp pain shot through her chest.

He remembered to prepare a gift for Phoebe-but not once had he ever given her anything.

She dialed a video call.

It connected quickly.

""What is it?""

The screen showed Vance's private lounge.

Elegant, luxurious, bathed in dazzling light-every inch oozed the extravagance that Zrefast was known for.

He wore a six-figure tailored suit, held a wine glass, and lounged casually on the sofa.

There was nothing calculating about him-just cool elegance. His expression was calm, aloof, and untouchable, like frost or snow. He was the kind of man people dreamed of but could never reach.

Estela had loved him for six whole years.

Her voice softened. ""It's been a while since we saw each other. Tonight, maybe-""

""Vance-""

Before she could finish, a soft, feminine voice chimed in on his end.

It was Phoebe.

The call cut off immediately.

Just before the screen went black, Vance said simply, ""We'll talk later.""

Estela tightened her grip on the phone, staring out at the towering skyline beyond the window.

Cars streamed through the streets like rivers of light. The city shimmered-so bright and beautiful it almost didn't seem real.

Her husband, Vance, controlled a financial empire and moved markets with ease. But for her-his wife-he had no warmth, no time, no care.

Six years, and he'd never changed. Always cold. Always distant.

Behind every kind word or gentle look was a wall she could never get past.

She'd spent all these years trying to win back his heart.

But in that moment, for the very first time-Estela felt something shift. She was tired.

Estela didn't call him back. She drifted into a restless, heavy sleep.

The next day, Vance finally sent a message: \[Sorry. Happy third anniversary.\]

Then another: \[This is to make up for it.\]

Not long after, a bank alert came through-an eight-figure deposit.

She scrolled past the messages, just as a notification popped up from Phoebe's social media.

\[A custom-made diamond ring from Egoset-eight months in the making. A once-in-a-lifetime piece. Thank you, Mr. Leon.\]

In the post, Phoebe was all smiles, radiant and charming. A dazzling diamond sparkled on her pale, delicate hand.

Dressed in a rose-red gown, she posed beneath a famous tower, the fabric swirling around her like wine. The whole image screamed luxury, decadence-and intention.

Estela suddenly remembered the day before she married Vance.

It was in the family's quiet, old estate. He'd walked past her along the corridor. His eyes were calm, unreadable-but they had seen straight through her illusions.

He said, ""I'll marry you. But that's all.""

Back then, she'd thought the line ""I want love, not money"" sounded childish-naive, even.

But now, for the first time, she got it.

For six years, she'd chased a fantasy-thinking all she wanted was his love.

And she'd never had it.

She forced down the emotions building inside her and quietly went downstairs.

In the garden, she heard Rowena's innocent, sing-song voice, laced with a hint of complaint. ""Why did Mommy come back? Phoebe promised to take us to see the bear ballet today. I wish Mommy just never came back.""

Chapter 2

""Yeah,"" Josh said softly, eyes downcast. ""Billy said Daddy only married Mommy because he couldn't marry Phoebe. Mommy's pretty, but I still like Phoebe more.""

The words hit Estela like ice water down her spine-sharp, sudden, cruel.

'He couldn't marry her?' she thought.

The shock took a moment to fade, and when it did, her heart felt hollow.

She looked at her children.

She'd nearly died giving birth to them-both times. Complications, hemorrhaging.

They'd been weak, sickly babies, and she'd cared for them around the clock. Barely slept, barely ate. It ruined her health.

Then something happened in Zrefast. Vance's father Reggie Leon fell gravely ill.

Vance went back to take charge-and brought the kids with him.

Since then, she'd been traveling back and forth between two cities. But every time she came back, the children seemed farther and farther away.

She didn't even remember how she got back to her room.

The kids had private lessons scheduled. The nanny took them out.

Even with everything on her plate, Estela messaged Vance again to ask for a meeting.

She was his wife. Whether it was about the kids or about Phoebe, she had every right to demand answers.

But he brushed her off with a single line. ""I have something important. Let's talk tomorrow night.""

There was no way to describe the bitterness welling up inside her.

She left the house without thinking and wandered to the place where she and Vance had first met-an old amusement park.

It was small, tucked away in a corner of the city.

Just as she stepped in and approached the Ferris wheel, she heard a familiar little voice. ""Phoebe, I want to ride the Ferris wheel!""

""Okay, I'll go get the tickets.""

Estela looked up-and there they were.

Not far away, Phoebe and Vance, each holding one of her children's hands. They looked, unmistakably, like a perfect family.

Soon, Estela heard her children's voices. ""You're the best. I want to be with you forever.""

Phoebe laughed softly, teasing, ""If your mom hears that, she won't be happy.""

""I don't like her. Why should I care if she's mad?""

The words hit Estela like a blast of arctic wind.

She stood frozen, watching in silence as Vance and her children walked hand in hand with Phoebe into the Ferris wheel.

The man she had loved for six years. The children she had brought into the world.

Without another moment's hesitation, Estela turned and walked away.

She'd been holding on for six years-it was time to let go.

Back at the old house, she quietly packed up all of her belongings.

Then she sent Vance one final message: \[Have the divorce papers ready.\]

She left her wedding ring on the nightstand, walked out without a backward glance, and called a cab to the airport.

\*\*\*\*\*

After leaving the church, Vance returned to the old house with the children.

The area outside the church was packed. Just as he was about to check his phone, someone shouted-

""Stop! Thief!""

A commotion erupted.

The bodyguards instinctively moved to shield him, but in the chaos, Phoebe was shoved forward-right into Vance's arms.

His phone slipped from his hand, crashed to the ground, and was crushed under the stampede of feet.

""Vance, I'm so sorry-your phone."" she said.

He frowned briefly, then said calmly, ""It's fine. I'll get another one.""

The phone was mostly used to keep in touch with family anyway.

Not that anyone in the Leon family texted much. If anyone messaged him at all, it was usually Estela.

But her messages had never seemed urgent.

\*\*\*\*\*

On the way home, the kids were buzzing with excitement.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve, eyes sparkling. ""Daddy, is Phoebe really going to stay with us soon? She promised to take me to Candyland!""

Even Josh looked hopeful.

""Yes,"" Vance nodded.

But Josh hesitated, frowning slightly. ""But Daddy. Mommy said we're not very healthy, and the air at Candyland might make us sick. She didn't want us to go. Won't Mommy be upset if she finds out Phoebe's moving in?""

Vance responded gently, ""Phoebe is trained in medicine. She once saved Daddy's life. With her here, you'll both be fine. Your mommy won't be staying long anyway. Phoebe's just visiting for a while to help take care of you.""

The kids had always been frail. Having Phoebe around might actually do them some good.

""Yay!"" They both shouted in delight as they arrived home.

But the moment they stepped inside, they found something that made them even happier-Estela had gone back to Trurgh.

Vance noticed the wedding ring placed neatly on the nightstand and paused, mildly surprised.

Ever since they got married, no matter how badly they fought, Estela had never taken off that ring.

Chapter 3

Now she had left without a word-and taken the ring off, too.

'Is she upset again? Feeling neglected?' he thought.

Estela had always been gentle and soft-spoken-like most women from Trurgh, traditional and reserved. No matter how coldly he treated her, she never pushed back.

'Well, even the calmest person has a breaking point,' he thought.

Still, Vance didn't take it too seriously.

He tossed the ring aside without a second thought.

""Mrs. Leon won't be coming back for a while. Pack up her things. Clean out the room-Ms. Silva will be moving in soon,"" he ordered.

Rowena and Josh's eyes instantly lit up.

'Now that Mom is gone, Phoebe can finally move in,' they thought.

'And no one would be breathing down our necks anymore-asking the doctors endless questions about our physical activity.'

'Mom always makes such a big deal out of everything. She insists we meet our monthly exercise quotas and hovers over us every time she comes home.'

""It's just a pity,"" Josh muttered gloomily. ""Mom said she'd help us finish building that spaceship. It's super hard.""

The puzzle had thousands of tiny pieces. Once completed, it would become an intricate model of a spaceship. Josh had been planning to give it to Phoebe as a birthday gift.

But it was exhausting and hard on the eyes-he'd been waiting for Estela to help.

Rowena pouted too. ""She was supposed to finish sewing clothes for my doll before she left.""

Every time Estela came back, she'd make a whole new wardrobe for the dolls. Phoebe always said how good Estela was at picking fabrics and matching colors.

But this time, Estela left so suddenly that the clothes weren't ready.

Now Phoebe wouldn't see them, and there'd be no compliments.

Estela wasn't as fun or glamorous as Phoebe, but when it came to fiddly little projects like this-she was actually really good.

\*\*\*\*\*

Meanwhile, in Trurgh-miles away-Estela returned to the home she once shared with Vance.

After he moved back to Zrefast with the kids, Estela had stayed behind. Officially, it was for work, but in truth, it was mostly to care for his parents.

Reggie had long settled in Zrefast, but the rest of the family had moved to Trurgh over a decade ago.

High society in Zrefast had its own rigid rules-everything from dress codes to dinner etiquette was micromanaged.

Rosalyn Leon never got along with Reggie and had no interest in returning to that life. She was used to being pampered and calling the shots-and preferred life in Trurgh, where things went her way.

The Leon family wasn't fond of women who were too outspoken or ambitious, so for Vance's sake, Estela had kept a low profile and stayed behind as the dutiful daughter-in-law.

Her job at Leon Group had always been in name only.

But now that she had made up her mind to divorce Vance, none of that mattered anymore.

She packed up everything in their marital home and prepared to hand over the keys.

Just as she came downstairs, suitcase in hand, the butler happened to see her.

""Mrs. Leon, you're back. Rosalyn mentioned she was craving that fish soup you made last time.""

But when he saw the luggage, he froze mid-sentence.

Estela handed him the house keys.

""I won't be living here anymore,"" she said with a faint smile. ""If she wants soup, tell her to hire a chef.""

Without waiting for a response, Estela turned and walked out-ignoring the butler's stunned expression.

That night, Rosalyn didn't get her fish soup.

\*\*\*\*\*

Later that evening, Vance video-called Rosalyn. She didn't waste time voicing her discontent.

""Honestly, you never should've married a woman from Trurgh. Can't even cook a simple dish of fish soup,"" she said.

He looked mildly surprised.

Estela had always been respectful and compliant, especially toward elders. Her defiance this time? Unexpected.

""It's just a dish,"" he said indifferently. ""If she won't make it, get someone else who will.""

Rosalyn looked uncomfortable.

Truth be told, she'd already tried hiring several chefs-but none of them could get it quite right. Not like Estela did.

Still, she couldn't admit that in front of her son. She muttered a vague reply and left it at that.

Off to the side, the butler hesitated, unsure whether to say anything about Estela moving out of the house.

""Mr. Leon. Mrs. Leon, she. she's moved out.""

He barely got the words out before Vance cut him off, voice cold and flat. ""Forget it. Leave her alone.""

Vance ended the call without a second thought.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office overlooking Zrefast, a faint trace of annoyance flickered across his otherwise impeccable face.

He glanced at his newly replaced phone, but in the end, didn't call the contact at the top of his list.

Chapter 4

Back at the church, both his phone and SIM card had been destroyed.

At first, he'd intended to let Estela know-she was still his wife, after all.

But lately, it seemed all the special treatment he'd given her over the years had gone to her head.

A little lesson wouldn't hurt.

Unaware of any of this, Estela slept soundly through the night.

The next morning, she returned to the Leon Group and submitted her resignation.

It went through without a hitch.

When Vance had placed her in the company, it was a low-level, nominal role. No one really knew her true identity.

So once she completed her handover, she could leave cleanly.

When word got out, a coworker remarked with a knowing smile, ""Must be for your kids, huh? They're what, four? Five? That age clings to their mom like glue. You always had their pictures on your desk-and that necklace with their little faces on it. You've always treated them like treasures.""

Estela paused.

She had loved Vance-deeply. And naturally, she loved the two children they had together. Even now, separated by cities, she still cared deeply for Rowena and Josh.

But.

She shook her head, offering a small smile. ""It's not about them.""

And that was the truth.

The Leon Group was massive and well-connected internationally, but its focus-construction and real estate-was never her passion.

Before, as Vance's wife, she hadn't questioned it. The expectations from the Leon family left little room for her own ambitions.

But now that she had chosen to leave him, she needed to choose her own future.

Her gaze drifted to her phone, where a headline flashed across the screen. \[National Heritage Expo: The Fragrant Arts.\]

Perfume blending. Coffee ceremony. Modern reinterpretations of traditional craftsmanship.

Something about it caught her eye.

Without hesitation, she texted her cousin, Wilford Warren: \[Any chance you can get me a ticket to this event?\]

He responded almost instantly. \[Of course. But aren't you always too busy? Between the Leon family and the kids, when do you ever have time for this kind of thing?\]

\[I do now.\] Estela replied calmly. \[I'm divorced.\]

There was a pause.

\[Wait-seriously?\] Wilford's response came with a stunned breath. \[You actually divorced into that Leon family?\]

The same Leon family who had built a private rooftop amusement park in the heart of Zrefast-just for their grandchildren. No outsiders allowed.

Back when Estela's parents died, the only reason the Leon family even considered the marriage was because her grandfather Keven Warren had once done them a great favor.

Otherwise, no way would they have let Vance marry the daughter of a university professor.

Even if that professor's father was none other than Keven-the renowned scholar of classical arts.

\[If it doesn't feel right, walk away.\] Estela replied lightly, with a smile.

Wilford couldn't tell if he admired her courage or pitied her choices. Maybe a bit of both.

Wilford: \[But... what about Rowena and Josh? Can you really let them go?\]

Estela glanced at her phone.

When the kids had moved back to Zrefast, she'd made sure they each had a phone-just in case they missed her and wanted to call.

But over the past year, unless she reached out first, neither of them had ever called her.

They had everything now: a powerful family name, a life of privilege. and a woman they already saw as their mother.

'So why should I keep clinging to a connection that only exists in blood?' she wondered.

\*\*\*\*\*

Back in Zrefast, inside the Leon family's estate, the nutritionist gently reminded the children, ""Josh, Rowena, did you forget what Ms. Warren said? No being picky with food. Your bodies are still fragile-you need a balanced intake of fat to grow up healthy. And no overdoing it with sweets.""

Josh hesitated, looking uncertain.

But Rowena waved it off like it was nothing.

""Mom already missed her check-in call! She won't know anything. Besides, Phoebe said kids should be happy! And right now, the thing that makes me happiest is eating all these cupcakes!""

Just then, a light laugh floated down from upstairs.

Phoebe came down, smiling as she walked over and gently tapped Rowena on the forehead. ""You little troublemaker. Alright-whatever Rowena and Josh want, they can have.""

""Yay! Phoebe, you're the best! I wish you could stay with us forever!""

Their innocent cheers made Phoebe's smile deepen.

The nutritionist frowned. She opened her mouth to object, but when her gaze landed on Phoebe, she hesitated-and fell silent.

At first, she had assumed Estela was the lady of the house. But now it was clear: Phoebe moved around the Leon family like she belonged. The kids were clearly attached to her.

If she upset Phoebe, it might not sit well with Vance.

Josh, meanwhile, was conflicted.

Posting this in the hopes of finding someone I genuinely vibe with. If this still doesn’t work out, I’ll just embrace my fate as the cool Tito who takes his pamangkins on spontaneous adventures. 😂 So please, save me from that destiny!

I’m 31, working in management, 5’10” and around 75kgs (BMI-okay). Looking for something sincere, grounded connection, good energy, and ideally something long-term.

📍 Based in the South (Alabang), and hoping **you’re within 1-2 hrs. drive para meetups won't feel like planning a company outing.**

# Things I’m Into

☕ Cozy coffee shops + slow mornings  
🚗 Spontaneous drives + long conversations  
🌃 City lights and parking-lot coffee  
🎮 PC games for stress relief  
🏕️ Chill outdoor escapes when life gets too loud  
🏃‍♂️ I don’t gym much, but I run 5–10km every other day. That counts, right?

My work schedule shifts weekly, so I’ve learned to value presence over consistency and peace over pressure.

# Faith & Lifestyle

* Open-minded. Respectful of all beliefs. I just avoid anything too controlling.
* I used to live the band life, smoked, partied, the works. But that chapter’s closed. I vape casually, and I’m open to quitting.
* Not a jet-setter (yet), but I’m down to explore, especially with the right person. I just need a heads up, not a plane ticket tomorrow.

# What I’m Looking For

* Biologically Woman - i believe i don't need to emphasize this one :)
* I’m drawn to women who are driven and passionate about what they do, but also **know how to make space for the people who matter**. Yung kayang maglaan ng oras, hindi lang when it’s convenient, but because they genuinely want to connect.
* You’re single (**non-negotiable**) and ideally financially stable or working
* I don’t have strict preferences sa looks. What matters more to me is confidence and how you carry yourself
* I’ll be honest: I’m generally more attracted to **women who aren’t on the chubby side** *(just a personal preference, no offense meant, and I hope that’s okay)*
* **I’m not looking for temporary setups or short chapters.** I value presence, effort, and sincerity. If you’re someone who’s also tired of surface-level talks and quick goodbyes, maybe we can try something a little more real.
* honestly, I think having kids is something that really depends on the woman I'm with. It’s her body, her call and I fully respect that. If she’s into the idea, cool, I’d be all in. If not, that’s totally fine too. At the end of the day, it’s about us being on the same page and happy with whatever life we build together :"">
* And most importantly, I’m looking for someone **emotionally available**. Someone who’s moved on from the past or at least isn’t dragging it into every new connection. Ayoko maging emotional sponge or placeholder habang kinakalaban mo pa ‘yung multo ng ex mo. Let’s both be present and intentional. I’ll meet you halfway, as long as you’re walking toward something real, too.

# The Non-Negotiables

❌ No ghosting. Just say it if you’re not feeling it.  
❌ No emotional tug-of-war with your ex’s shadow  
✅ Consistency over love bombing  
✅ Real effort, real connection

I’m not asking for perfection. Just honesty and shared intent.

If you’re into late-night drives, long convos, quiet coffees, and real connections, let’s give it a shot.

Partner(m) and best friend(f) have history — They hang alone weekly.,"How do you know when a friendship with a former fling gets too emotionally close for comfort? What boundaries would be fair to set without policing their relationship?

I’ve been in a relationship for a few months now, And am trying to figure out if my discomfort is about my personal boundaries… or am I being unreasonable? 

Before we got together, my partner casually dated someone for several months (few years back). It wasn’t exclusive and it eventually fizzled out (she rejected him first). After about a month or so of no contact, they reconnected as friends — and now they’ve been best friends for several years.

They hang out at least once a week — often 1 on 1— for coffee, dinner, drinks, walks, or just relaxing at each other’s places. They talk about their dating lives, share photos of families, and sometimes call just to check in. Even after group hangouts, they’ll often continue the rest of the night together 1 on 1. Their time together can span most of the day. Only recently, they even planned a trip together to his hometown to stay with his family, but that fell through and she ended up not going.

He reassures me that it's fully platonic, and that the romantic connection just wasn’t there. He explained that their bond grew partly because they’re in a similar life stage as most of their peers are settled down/busy with families. He has encouraged me to meet her.

I can’t help but feel uneasy with the emotional intimacy and the regularity of their 1 on 1 time. I'm trying hard to build trust in this still new relationship but their dynamic makes it all difficult for me to assume good intent.",1,1752465804.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1lzcmsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1lzcmsy/tw_loss/,TW: loss,"Hi everyone. We have an 18 month old boy who is beautiful and completely healthy so I am trying to remind myself of how lucky I am because some people don’t even get that.

I just need to vent so here goes nothing. 
My 8 week prenatal visit for our second baby was this past Wednesday the 9th. I was so excited and nervous. We had just announced the pregnancy to our family on 4th of July because I couldn’t wait any longer. 

At the OB appointment the tech began the ultrasound and immediately I knew something was wrong. I didn’t see a little baby in there at all like how I saw at my 8week appointment for my son. The tech asked me if I was sure I was 8 weeks and I absolutely was considering it was over a month since I even tested positive, if anything I would have been more than 8 weeks by a few days. She began to do a full internal scan of my pelvic region, uterus, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes. She said she couldn’t confirm anything but I had a good idea what was going on and I waited for the doctor as I was sobbing in office. The doctor reviews my ultrasounds and tells me he believes the pregnancy could be no longer than 4-5 weeks and that they were going to take blood then take it again in 2 days to compare the HGC levels to see if the pregnancy was viable if the levels would rise. Went back in Friday for my second blood draw and was told the results would be in once the weekend was over and that they’d call me on Monday.

From Wednesday on I felt like a shell of a human. Just completely destroyed and crying all day long. I was able to hold it together until me husband got home from work and took the reins on our toddler, then I’d sit on the floor of the shower and sob for an hour every night. 

Now here’s the insane part.
Sunday morning rolls around and my husband had to go do a CPR certificate renewal for his job. So I wake up, pour my coffee and pour my son’s milk then head to his room to get him out of his crib. As I started walking down the stairs with him I started feeling a little lightheaded, I got him on his changing table to change his diaper and instantly the room was spinning. I took him down asap because I was scared of passing out while he was up there. At this point I started dry heaving so I gave him his milk and sat him in front of the TV. I ran to the bathroom and within seconds started puking bile, tried to get up once it was over and all I saw was black. Before I knew it I was stuck laying on the bathroom floor completely drenched in sweat soaking through my clothes, and I could not move and could not get up. Thank god I had my phone next to me I called everyone. Called my husband 10 times, my SIL, my MIL, my best friend, NOBODY WAS ANSWERING. Finally my step sister answered and I told her what was going on and I needed someone to come be with my son because I needed to go to the hospital. She’s on her way and finally my SIL calls back and she instantly called the ambulance. Husband calls back and he flew home instantly. 

Ambulance got me all loaded up and my blood pressure and oxygen immediately dropped to horriblly low levels as I’m freezing cold and shaking with blue fingernails. I told them I had thought I was miscarrying based on my appointment the few days prior, but they said something wasn’t right it seems worse than that. They got me to the hospital and the doctors and nurses are all drawing my blood, hooking up IVs and one doctor brings out the ultrasound machine. Instantly he discovers that I was having an ectopic pregnancy and my fallopian tube had burst, and I was internally bleeding BAD. They rushed me into emergency surgery. I passed out from the anesthesia and woke up being told that the damage was so bad they had to remove my entire left fallopian tube and that I needed several blood transfusions due to losing 1/3 of my body’s blood volume. I have three incisions in my belly, and one in my belly button. 

I’m now sitting here struggling to sleep, I’m in so much pain it’s not even funny. Breathing hurts, coughing hurts, crying hurts. I’m in too much pain right now to grieve and be sad about losing my baby and a part of my body. 
I’m just so confused. How did the ultrasound tech at my 8 week visit miss such a serious issue when she specifically had to look for a pregnant outside the uterus in that instance? I’m going to heal up a bit first before I start asking questions but I feel like this traumatic day and all of this pain could have been completely preventable.

I can’t pick my son up for at least a week, and he is my little bestie so it’s been even harder being “separate” from him as my husband tries to keep him away from me so he doesn’t jump on me/try to roughhouse. 

So that’s my story that I never in a million years thought would happen to me. Thank god I have therapy tomorrow. ",11,1752465658.0,beyondthebump,8,1.0,False

1lzcj9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1lzcj9s/it_ended_over_two_years_ago_and_theyre_still/,It ended over two years ago and they're still around,"My (F38) ex-partner (F35) still has access to me because she's friends with my upstairs neighbors. It has made life very difficult and made it hard to heal. Its gotten better but when she shows up, as she did yesterday, I have to ground myself again, which I've been doing. Here's a reminder of what it was like. Perhaps you are living this too.

  
Shit she got mad at me for. She got mad at me a lot. And she did not express anger or frustration nicely.

* Not having sex with her
* Stopping during sex because I was uncomfortable or dissociating
* Making her coffee without asking first
* Making her coffee “wrong”
* Making myself coffee and not offering her any
* Asking her to stay in bed with me in the morning
* Getting out of bed without announcing where I was going
* Starting to get ready for bed without telling her
* Playing an audiobook on my headphones before bed without offering to let her listen
* Playing my audiobook out loud instead of using headphones
* Playing a metronome in a different room so I could do PT. It was too loud
* Putting something away in the wrong place in her bathroom
* Asking her how she was doing
* Asking “what are you cooking” or “how did you sleep”
* Telling her she had done something that hurt me, even gently
* Trying to comfort her or respond when she was upset
* Needing to walk my boss’s dog I was dogsitting before bed and not telling her ahead of time (dogs go on walks, it should be self-evident)
* Being anxious that I forgot to cancel a therapy appointment (which she interpreted as me hiding something)
* Suggesting an alternate driving route (e.g., saying “maybe try a left turn”)
* Not paying for something she grabbed at Walmart
* Making plans that didn’t involve her
* Grabbing my arm or shoulder during conversations
* Meeting up for a plan we'd made but not telling her in advance I was feeling a bit down that day
* Seeming too happy when she wasn’t
* Forgetting to warn her in advance about anything minor
* Trying to de-escalate or resolve a conflict in a calm way
* Got angry when I told her—gently—that something she did hurt me
* Accused me of attacking her or being cruel when I tried to set a boundary
* Told me I was making her feel unsafe just for expressing discomfort
* Collapsed to the floor or hit herself when I brought up concerns, making me feel like I had hurt her
* Said things like “sorry you feel that way” instead of taking any responsibility
* Being just awful to me when I was taking care of her when she got ankle surgery
* Gaslighting me in the car on the way to the ER when I had a fever of 103 and a serious kidney infection. I asked her ""just be nice to me"" and she asked over and over to explain, what specifically that means, and as soon as I said ""just tell jokes"" she flipped a switch and was perfect for the rest of the day
* Accused me of lying, hiding things, or being manipulative when I was just trying to communicate
* Demanded I admit that something didn’t happen (like when she accidentally(?) touched my healing tattoo), or straight up said ""I couldn't have said that"" after saying something hurtful
* Shifted conversations to focus on her pain or confusion whenever I tried to discuss mine
* Claimed I was the one being unkind or aggressive whenever I expressed hurt, even calmly
* Used my emotional reactions as proof that I was unstable, dramatic, or too much
* Weaponized her own distress to derail or shut down conversations about accountability
* Made me feel like I had to apologize for things she had done
* Turned every attempt at repair into a referendum on my tone, phrasing, or timing
* I paid for a ton of her shit and gave her money to pay her taxes. Probably paid for \~$5000+ worth of stuff for her over 3 years.
* Ruining every vacation or time away
* Our breakup -- I sent her a letter saying we needed to work on communication or I was leaving. When she cried that night I asked why, she refused to speak. A week later I asked about the letter. She said she hadn't read it.
* When I'd try to communicate, there would be constant shutdowns (going silent), meltdowns (hitting herself, ""falling over"", or slamming doors), or ""denial/reverals"" accusing me of whatever I was saying bothered me. Also criticizing specific words I was using even though I was speaking carefully.
* Using her childhood and mental illness to excuse the abuse.
* There's so much more.

The effects of this relationship both during and after have been long-lasting, destabilizing, and deeply painful. Some I noticed immediately; others only became clear after we broke up and she kept coming by my house.

* I stopped trusting my own perceptions of reality
* I learned to monitor everything I said, did, and felt in advance
* I was convinced I was bad, or a narcissist, that I just needed to become better
* Relapse into substance use
* Relapse into bulimia
* I became afraid of being misunderstood or punished over nothing
* I started narrating my movements and decisions to avoid setting her off
* I lost my ability to rest or feel safe in my own body
* I assumed others were out to get me, or talking about me, or that I would be cut off from everyone 
* Fear she would break into my house and kill me (after relationship, tho there was no actual danger)
* I couldn’t sleep near her many nights—I’d wake up tense, afraid, and emotionally flooded
* I often moved to the couch to avoid disturbing her with my dysregulation
* I experienced frequent shame and panic in response to minor needs or preferences
* I started to believe I was too sensitive, too difficult, or impossible to love
* I gaslit myself constantly, especially after she gaslit me
* I made excuses for her behavior even when it was hurting me
* I never told any of my friends until after we broke up about any of this
* I left an entire friend group to avoid her, even though she remained connected to them
* I developed PTSD symptoms after the relationship ended, especially as she used her relationship with my upstairs neighbors to maintain access to the property.
* At the end of the relationship my existing issues worsened, I spiraled into body dysmorphia, worsened by a surgery I got 3 months after we broke up that I now regret and am barely functioning as a result of
* I couldn’t say “no” without fear—whether in bed, in conversation, or in daily routines
* I minimized everything to survive
* I began planning to sell my home just to finally have peace after the breakup
* I started to believe I was fundamentally broken
* I felt disgusting in my own skin
* I showed almost every sign of emotional abuse
* I still feel afraid to tell this story in full, I'm afraid she will find this and punish me.
* And even now, some part of me wonders if I’m being dramatic",1,1752465345.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

New week, same symptoms. The charts are still infected with Morgan Wallen, *Ordinary* still tops the list like a motivational quote with abandonment issues, and the most exciting thing that happened was Chappell Roan clawing her way back into the top 10 with glitter and spite. Buckle up.

**1. Ordinary – Alex Warren**  
This song has reached the stage of rot where even the mold is bored. It is the audio equivalent of waiting in line at the DMV while someone argues about expired coupons. How it continues to top the chart is a mystery best left to cursed spreadsheets and payola goblins.

**2. What I Want – Morgan Wallen featuring Tate McRae**  
At this point, Morgan wants a fifth of Jack and validation, and Tate wants a way out of the studio. This track feels like a failed group project where one person wrote all the lyrics and the other one showed up to class hungover with iced coffee and vibes.

**3. Just In Case – Morgan Wallen**  
Still lurking like a spam text from your emotionally unstable ex. This isn’t a song, it is a collection of vague apologies written in Sharpie on a Waffle House napkin.

**4. A Bar Song (Tipsy) – Shaboozey**  
There are ancient runes that have lasted fewer weeks than this song. It is now a permanent fixture of the Top 10 like background music in a gas station bathroom. You cannot escape it and you are not meant to.

**5. I'm The Problem – Morgan Wallen**  
We know. We’ve known. Saying it out loud is not growth when the music still sounds like a breakup letter dictated to Siri after two Fireball shots and a truck commercial.

**6. Luther – Kendrick Lamar and SZA**  
The last dignified track on this list and it is hanging on like a lone marble column in a collapsing temple. This is what happens when talent sneaks onto a chart built by people who think “emotional” means adding a banjo and lowering the BPM.

**7. Manchild – Sabrina Carpenter**  
The snarky edge is still cutting, but the chart is too numb to feel it. Sabrina gave you a diss track wrapped in rhinestones and all she got in return was demotion via tractor-core. Criminal.

**8. Lose Control – Teddy Swims**  
There are fossils with less age on them than this track. Teddy is still crying, still belting, and still somehow present in every emotionally manipulative montage on YouTube. At this point, it belongs in the Smithsonian.

**9. Die With A Smile – Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars**  
Week 41. This song is now eligible for early retirement and a themed cruise. It sounds like what happens when two wedding singers unionize and try to record a eulogy for the concept of subtlety.

**10. Pink Pony Club – Chappell Roan**  
Finally back. Finally justice adjacent. This track is still louder, queerer, and more alive than anything above it, which is probably why the chart has spent months pretending it doesn't exist. It deserves better but it brought its own confetti anyway.

**Wrap up**  
The charts this week feel like they were curated by a hungover Spotify intern who only had one playlist and half a country station to work with. Morgan Wallen continues to run Billboard like it’s a family reunion with backup vocals. Kendrick and Chappell are the only signs of intelligent life. Everyone else is busy writing apology songs that double as excuses for creative stagnation. See you next week unless the chart finally collapses under the weight of its own redundancy.",1,1752465231.0,billbored,0,1.0,False

My last grocery run was painful. It feels like what used to be a $100 trip is now easily $300, and fresh produce is a huge part of that.

As a local app developer, I started wondering: what if there was a better tool for this? I'm exploring an idea for an app that's different from just Browse flyers. It would be a simple, searchable tool specifically for finding the cheapest produce in our city each week.

To make it a real, sustainable project, it would need to have a small subscription fee, around the cost of a single coffee each month.

I really want to build something that's genuinely helpful for Saskatoon families. So, my question is: would a tool like this be valuable to you? What would make it a ""no-brainer"" for your household?

Shattered by the Alpha, Stronger Than Ever
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
The moment that slap landed, the world went eerily silent.

Alpha Kael Creed’s hand sliced through the air like a blade. And then a sharp crack echoed through the room.

My head snapped to the side. A metallic taste flooded my mouth, and a ringing noise exploded in my ears like a swarm of bees trapped in my skull.

I stumbled, catching myself on the edge of the desk, my fingers trembling.

My left cheek went numb before it began to burn—hot, sharp, humiliating.

When I looked up, Kael’s hand was still hanging midair, his knuckles bone-white with tension.

My mate. My fiancé. And now the man who’d just struck me in front of everyone—to defend his precious Beta—Riley.

For a brief second, Kael’s expression faltered. A flicker of guilt. But it vanished, swallowed by rage and impatience.

“Talia, can you stop making a scene for once?”

Someone snorted. A few others chuckled under their breath. No one stepped in.

Riley stood beside him, chestnut curls catching the light like strands of honey. Her red lips curled into a lazy, mocking smile.

“Kael, don’t be so harsh. Look—you’ve scared your little mate. Poor thing’s about to cry.”

Kael’s jaw tightened, his eyes still smoldering, but he reined in his tone, voice sharp yet measured. “Talia, this is Ashveil Pack, not Silverclaw. Try to remember where you are.”

The room buzzed with murmurs and half-stifled laughter.

I touched the corner of my mouth. It came away wet, though I couldn’t tell if it was blood or tears.

Eighteen years of knowing this man. I’d seen every side of his temper—but I never knew a slap could sting this bad.

Humiliation, rage, and heartbreak twisted together like barbed wire in my chest.

I dug my nails into my palms, swallowing the scream lodged in my throat.

Kael started to say something else, but I didn’t care anymore.

I turned on my heel, grabbed my bag, and shoved the glass doors open.

Behind me, someone let out a sharp whistle. “Look at her run. She waddles like a damn penguin!”

I had no idea where I was going—I just knew I couldn’t stay here.

I couldn’t stand one more minute in Ashveil Pack. Not with those eyes on me. Not with that handprint burning on my face.

Sure, Kael never had much patience with me. But he’d never hit me before.

This wasn’t just a slap. It was the first time in my life someone had ever struck me.

Not even when my world first fell apart at six years old.

Back then, Silverclaw Pack was attacked, and my parents moved us into the Ashveil Pack for safety.

That’s when I first saw Kael.

He was sitting in the yard, playing with a toy truck. Sunlight streamed down, stretching his shadow long across the ground until it brushed the tips of my shoes.

We grew up next door to each other.

My mom used to say we were like two saplings growing side by side. Only… Kael grew faster. Stronger.

When we were in grade school, a boy named Tommy stuck a wad of chewed-up gum in my ponytail.

The class burst into laughter.

The teacher tried to smooth it over. “He just likes you, sweetheart. Boys tease girls they like. Don’t cry.”

Those words stung worse than the gum.

After school, I cried all the way home.

Kael’s father, David Creed, heard what happened. He called out to his son, who was doing homework on the floor.

“Kael. Tomorrow. Go have a word with Tommy in second grade.”

The next day, Kael stormed into my classroom and kicked the back door open.

He moved like a wild little beast, charging Tommy with his tiny fists clenched. He slammed a fist on the boy’s desk.

“Listen up,” he growled, grabbing Tommy by the collar—still speaking in that soft, childish voice. “Talia’s my little sister. If you ever mess with her again, I’ll end you.”

Before leaving, he patted my head.

And from that moment on, I became Kael’s shadow.

Chapter 2
Back in middle school, Kael would always hit the field after class to play soccer. His teammates would drag him off for ice cream, and I’d squat on the sidelines with my backpack, waiting so long that my stomach would start growling.

He’d grumble and yank me up by the arm. “Talia, are you glued to me or something?”

But he’d still break his strawberry popsicle in half and give me the bigger piece.

As I remembered, he hated when people said he ""hung out with girls.""

One time I went looking for him, and his buddies started teasing, “Look, Kael brought his little mate!”

He got so pissed he chucked his whole bag of marbles down the storm drain.

But when I missed school the next day with a fever, he skipped class, climbed the fence, and showed up outside my window.

He tossed crumpled notes through the screen, each one scrawled with a messy little joke meant to make me laugh.

By high school, I caught him staring at me more times than I could count—when I was chewing on a pen while solving equations; when I tucked my hair behind my ear; even when I dozed off on my desk.

His gaze would land softly on me like the brush of a summer breeze—barely there, but impossible to ignore.

One morning, I turned around suddenly and caught him in the act.

“Kael,” I said, locking eyes with him, “how do you solve this problem?”

His pen slipped right out of his hand.

Sunlight poured in through the windows, lighting up the tips of his ears until they looked like they were glowing.

“I, uh...” He scrambled to pick up his pen, his bangs brushing my fingers. “It’s just... I mean...”

His voice trailed off into a mumble.

I rested my chin on my hand and just watched him.

Turned out, the same boy who once punched another kid for bullying me—would tremble just from being near me.

Outside the window, moonflower petals drifted down like snow onto his open textbook.

On the night I turned eighteen, under the glow of the full moon, our wolves finally recognized each other.

My wolf had no doubt: he’s the one. He’s our mate.

Our parents were overjoyed and immediately proposed a union between the packs.

And Kael? He pulled me into the fire escape and slammed the door behind us.

The motion-sensor lights flickered overhead. His palm was clammy, but his grip on my fingers was so tight it almost hurt.

“Think this through,” he said hoarsely. “You’re still young. What if... What if someone better comes along someday?”

I reached up on tiptoe and pressed my fingers over his lips.

“There’s no one better than you, Kael.”

He flinched like I’d shocked him—then kissed me like he was finally letting go of every hesitation he’d ever had.

In the dark, I touched the scar on the back of his neck—the one he got in eighth grade, shielding me from falling debris.

That night, moonlight filtered through the iron grates, casting broken shadows over us both.

And his amber eyes shimmered like something out of a dream.

After college, I joined the Ashveil Enterprises—a company long controlled by Kael’s family, and ended up working under Kael.

Everything was perfect.

Right up until we were about to get engaged.

That’s when she showed up.

Riley.

An Omega transfer. Kael’s new Beta.

From day one, she played the sweet girl card hard—handing out coffees with a megawatt smile.

“Nice to meet you all! I’m looking forward to working with you!”

But when she reached my desk, she froze.

“Oh my god...” she covered her mouth with a giggle. “Are people still using Hello Kitty thermoses?”

I didn’t say anything.

She bit her lip. “Oops, I didn’t mean it in a bad way! I just say what’s on my mind. No offense, okay?” She leaned closer. “But seriously... aren’t you a little old for all this cutesy stuff? I thought women in the workplace were supposed to be, like, elegant and put-together.”

It felt like the whole office turned to stare at me at once.

My Hello Kitty keyboard, the figurines on my desk, the pink dust covers around my monitor...

Kael used to call these things “Talia’s fortress.”

Now, under those judgmental eyes, they felt like a childish display begging to be laughed at.

My ears rang like someone had poured acid into my skull.

Riley's constant laugh drilled straight through me, loud and shrill, like a jackhammer cracking open the little world I’d built for myself—cute, safe, and stupidly naive.

“Geez, relax. It’s just a joke, grandma. Don’t tell me you can’t even take a little teasing?”

My knuckles went white, fingers digging into the hem of my skirt.

“Enough.”

Kael’s voice rang out behind me.

I turned and saw his mouth curled in a sharp, dangerous smile—his signature tell when he was pissed.

The sun backlit him from the floor-to-ceiling windows, giving his profile a golden edge.

For a second, he looked just like the boy who once beat up a classmate for gluing gum in my hair.

Riley pouted. “Sorry, I was just joking. You’re not really going to overreact like this, are you?”

“This isn’t a coffee shop. If you want to gossip, Riley, then maybe you should quit and go start a podcast.”

She slunk back to her desk, face stiff with barely concealed rage.

Chapter 3
I don’t even know when things changed between Kael and Riley.

It was like I blinked, and suddenly… the lunch our housekeeper sent over from home came with three sets of utensils.

I stared at the takeout bags, my voice shaking. “There’s nothing here I even like.”

Kael didn’t even look up from his reports.

“We’re doing salads today. Riley says it’s good to cleanse the system once in a while…”

Riley slid into the seat next to me, holding her designer coffee like it was a prop in a rom-com.

“Oops! My bad, Talia~”

Her manicured nails tapped on the lid, sending out a hollow rhythm.

“I forgot you’re not into salads. But hey, grown-ups do need to eat healthy sometimes, right?”

She left the rest unsaid—but the smug curve of her lips finished it for her.

I looked at her, my voice quiet but steady.

“You keep saying my name like we’re best friends or something. Newsflash—you're older than me. Should I be calling you grandma?”

The office went dead silent.

For a second, Riley looked like I’d slapped her. Her perfectly winged eyeliner twitched.

That’s when Kael finally looked up from his desk—just to frown at me.

“Talia, that was uncalled for.”

Once upon a time, he punched a kid for calling me a crybaby.

Now, he was scolding me—for bruising another Omega’s ego.

I laughed once, short and sharp, and turned on my heel to leave.

Kael instinctively reached for me.

But when he pulled me into his arms this time, I caught a different scent on his shirt—Riley’s perfume.

Even his compromise felt dismissive.

“Alright, alright. I’ll tell the housekeeper to make you steak tomorrow, okay?”

Riley’s face twisted for a split second.

And that was the beginning of the end.

From the next day on, Riley turned it up a notch.

I walked into the office with my light pink tote, a tiny Lina Bell charm dangling off the zipper.

The moment she saw it, she gasped dramatically and pitched her voice to theatrical levels. “Oh. My. God. A Chanel tote and a cartoon keychain? That’s… a bold combo, babe.”

A few of the male coworkers chuckled behind their screens.

At lunch, I pulled out a disinfectant wipe and gave my disposable chopsticks a quick swipe.

Riley leaned over, smiling like we were besties. “Aw, that’s cute. You still do that?”

She turned to the guy next to her and added in a stage whisper, “I swear, she treats everything like it’s biohazard season.”

They both laughed like it was the funniest thing they’d heard all week.

Then came the annual department reshuffle at Ashveil Enterprises.

I was lugging my monitor across the room, arms aching, when I finally stopped to catch my breath.

Riley slammed her desk for attention like she was about to break into a comedy routine. “Everyone look! Disney princess down! Any brave knight wanna help our damsel in distress?”

She and the others burst out laughing. Some even clapped.

It was humiliating.

Kael—at least at first—would frown and mutter,

“Cut it out. Don’t go too far.”

But Riley always laughed sweetly and brushed it off. “C’mon, I’m just joking! Talia’s always so uptight—I’m just helping her loosen up!”

And Kael… paused. Then nodded. “She has been kinda sensitive lately. Girls these days, I guess…”

Riley grinned and playfully punched his shoulder.

“Hey! Don’t lump me in with her. I’m not the same.”

Kael chuckled, his eyes softening.

Like she was something special.

My chest tightened.

So that’s how he saw me now—delicate, moody, too much.

To Kael, anime was childish.

Being tidy meant I had “issues.”

Quiet meant I was “too shy.”

But once, just once… he used to call all those things my sparkle.

Chapter 4
During my annual leave, I went on a beach trip with my parents.

The sun was blazing, the breeze was soft, and for once, I had fun. I didn’t worry about work, or Kael, or anyone else.

I came back with sun-kissed skin, bronzed from the ocean light.

I didn’t think anything of it—until the moment I walked into the office that Monday, wearing a soft pink knit top.

Riley’s eyes zeroed in on me like a viper spotting prey.

“Oh. My. God!” she practically shrieked, slapping a hand over her mouth with theatrical flair.

“Talia, you seriously wore that color? With that tan?”

Her laugh was sharp and metallic, the kind that made your teeth ache—like nails on a chalkboard.

“Seriously though,” she snorted, turning to her usual peanut gallery, “what princess from Disney shows up looking like that? I don’t remember seeing any princesses…umm…ugly...”

One of the guys snickered. Another actually laughed out loud.

I froze, heat rushing to my face, not from embarrassment—but fury.

And Kael?

He was standing right there.

He looked at me.

Then he smiled.

Not a warm smile. Not one of those ""I’ve got you"" kinds of looks.

No. It was cold. Dismissive. Almost amused.

He didn’t say a word to defend me, nor even frown.

That was the moment something inside me cracked.

Maybe it was the eighteen years of friendship.

Maybe it was the illusion I’d built around him.

Or maybe it was the feelings I once had for him as my mate.

But I’ve never been the type to just sit there and take it. So I grabbed the nearest cup of coffee—mine—and threw it straight into Riley’s face.

She shrieked like a banshee as the liquid splattered across her perfect makeup, mascara streaking down her cheeks in two dark, dripping lines.

“What the hell is wrong with you?!” she shrieked, clutching at her face like it had been acid.

I smirked, voice cold and sharp, “Aren’t you the one who always says you’re not some dainty Omega? So what’s with the full face of war paint at nine a.m.? False lashes, lip gloss, contour sharper than your attitude—honestly, Riley, you wear more makeup than I do.”

Gasps echoed around the office. A couple coworkers rushed over to break things up.

Kael snatched the coffee cup out of my hand, eyes glinting with anger.

“Talia,” he said through clenched teeth, “apologize.”

I stared him down, my throat burning, but my voice steady as ice.

“She humiliated me in front of everyone. And you laughed. But now that I’m not playing nice, suddenly I’m the problem?”

His jaw clenched. “Stop acting like a child. You were out of line. Own it.”

I gave a bitter laugh. “Own it? Own this.”

And I said it. The three words that shattered everything.

“Go screw yourself.”

The room froze.

Then—

SLAP.

His palm cracked against my face like thunder.

In the ringing silence, I could hear Riley’s triumphant little sob, the whispers of coworkers, the disbelief crawling across every wall of that office.

And I realized—this was it.

Eighteen years of history.

Broken.

I slowly looked up at the boy who once punched another kid for calling me names.

“Kael,” I said quietly, voice steady, “We’re done.”

1lzcclo,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietnamMarketReport/comments/1lzcclo/starbucks_may_sell_70_of_its_china_business_10/,Starbucks May Sell 70% of Its China Business — $10 Billion Valuation in Play,"One of the most notable food and beverage (F&B) deals of the year is underway: **Starbucks is reportedly planning to sell up to 70% of its China business**, with a **valuation of around $10 billion**. The company is expected to retain a 30% stake to maintain brand control while seeking a local strategic partner to boost operational efficiency and competitiveness.

This move signals a strategic shift for Starbucks — from full ownership to **power-sharing in its second-largest market (after the U.S.)**. But why now?

# Why is Starbucks “sharing power” in its flagship growth market?

A combination of internal and external pressures has been building for years:

# 1. Rapid loss of market share

Starbucks' market share in China dropped from **34% in 2019 to just 14%** in recent years. Meanwhile, domestic rivals like **Luckin Coffee (18,000+ stores)** and **Mixue (46,000+ outlets)** have exploded by offering ultra-affordable pricing (\~$1–2 per drink), highly optimized logistics, and aggressive store rollouts.

# 2. A global model that no longer fits the local market

Chinese consumers — especially Gen Z — increasingly demand **localized experiences, emotional value, and high convenience**. Starbucks has adjusted pricing recently, but still struggles to compete against local brands' pricing and cultural relevance. Its centralized, global-first model has become too slow to respond.

# 3. Need for a local partner to scale faster

CEO Laxman Narasimhan (and former CEO Howard Schultz before him) have acknowledged the need to **cooperate with a local entity**. Starbucks is reportedly seeking a partner with strengths in consumer data, supply chain management, digital channels, and localized innovation, critical elements necessary to scale from 7,800 to 20,000 stores in China.

In essence, this is a shift from **""full control"" to ""collaborative growth""** — a strategic pivot to stay competitive in an increasingly localized and dynamic market.

# Strategic Takeaways for F&B Founders Globally (Especially in Emerging Markets)

# 1. A global brand doesn’t guarantee local success

Starbucks is a prime case of how winning globally doesn’t mean winning everywhere. Localization is more than just product tweaks; it demands end-to-end rethinking of pricing, marketing, supply chain, and digital infrastructure.

# 2. Scaling requires strategic partnerships

Even a global powerhouse like Starbucks needs allies to expand sustainably. Founders should ask: *“Who should I partner with to scale smarter, not just faster?”* That could be a local investor, a tech enabler, or an operating partner.

# 3. Data and customer experience are the new core capabilities

Knowing your customers deeply — their habits, preferences, and emotional triggers — is what enables personalization, retention, and long-term loyalty. Without this, scale quickly turns into fragility.

# Final thoughts

This isn’t just a business deal. It’s a signal: **even the most powerful global brands must rethink control, structure, and strategy when facing hyperlocal competitors.**

For entrepreneurs in fast-changing markets like Vietnam, Indonesia, or India, Starbucks’ move may be the blueprint (or warning sign) for how to adapt, collaborate, and scale in the new era of F&B growth.",1,1752464755.0,VietnamMarketReport,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1lhyz63/getting_back_in_shape_as_a_31_year_old_with_3_kids/?sort=new

Tomorrow I will be 3 weeks smoke free. Been using zyn as an alternative and it's helped but i'm conscious of not creating another habit, but like many of you said it's all about small steps in the right direction.

2 out of the last 3 weeks I dieted really well. I maintained a high protein diet (200-250 grams of protein a day). I drank only water and coffee with some electrolyte packs once a day. I meal prepped and felt great. This last week I didn't really fall off the wagon, just didn't prioritize meal prep so I ate less protein but still managed to avoid all fast food and sugary drinks. I've had two zero sugar, zero calorie Monsters and one Dr Pepper Zero when work got really stressful (it's the end of a job and the whole project is behind schedule, so the threat of liquidated damages has us working 7 days a week to get everything done). I didn't really like those drinks and preferred water.

I worked out one day in the first week doing some youtube workout (Juice and Toya) and it kicked my ass. I was sore for days and avoided working out more because it affected me at work more than I liked. I did average 8,000-12,000 steps almost every day which was a goal of mine.

I have no idea how much weight i've lost because I just haven't been checking. My guess is about 5-10 lbs. Week 1 I was down 3 lbs alone then I stopped checking. I get some anxiety when it comes to looking at the scale often.

So that's the update, I feel awesome. I feel confident and like i'm in control of my own appetites and desires which is a foreign feeling to me. 

I don't want to plateau so what are some things you guys would suggest for me to do now? Thanks again everybody!",1,1752464731.0,fitness30plus,1,1.0,False

It’s everything *after* that.

Yeah, writing the code, designing the MVP, wiring the backend that stuff was actually fun.

The moment I had to switch hats and become “founder mode”? Different story.

Here’s what hit me the hardest:

* **The emotional whiplash** One hour I feel like the next Zuckerberg. The next I’m questioning why I even started.
* **Nobody cares (yet)** You build this thing, pour everything into it… and your first post gets 2 likes and a sympathy DM from your friend.
* **Trying to do everything** Marketing, support, onboarding, sales, social content, updates, bugs, tax stuff… all while running on 4 hours of sleep and 2 iced coffees.
* **Talking to users feels like rejection therapy** Everyone says “talk to users” but hearing people ignore, ghost, or say “meh” to something you gave your life to? Not for the faint of heart.
* **Comparing yourself nonstop** You see someone go viral or raise $2M for their “calendar sync for dogs” app and suddenly your little tool feels like a joke.
* **You don't know if you're working smart or just coping** Am I building? Or am I just distracting myself from what I *should* be doing?

Sometimes I wonder if the real skill of building a startup is just emotional durability.  
Like yeah, product-market fit is nice  
but have you ever white-knuckled your way through 6 months of silence just hoping *someone* clicks your link?

Anyway just wanted to get this out there in case anyone else feels like they’re barely holding it together some days.

If you’re also building, I’d love to hear what your personal struggle is right now.

I was bouncing around the idea of creating a small online marketplace that you could buy/sell/give away any of your mugs that also live their lives collecting dust like Wheezy from Toy Story.

(Now I had the coffee around 10 hours ago) But when I felt at my head and attempted to expand it, it felt as if there was an anchor to it, or as if it was an anchor (figuratively). While the rest of my consciousness was far away, my head stayed in place at the boundary of the skull, really refusing to expand. It was quite interesting, as my head energy felt as if it was being pulled by so much more energy than it has to expand past the boundary (well it was), like a very tight balloon that is being filled with helium but won’t expand further : there was lots of ‘pressure’ here. Not bad pressure mind you, but it really refused to expand, which when you have to deal with it you’ll deal with it & I did what I came there for.

Needing the bed to be made before I tuck in helps me be comfortable. It helps me get a good nights sleep. If it bothers you so much that after you lay down, I ask you to get up so I can make the bed, then maybe once in a while, you can beat me to it. That would make me so happy. It'll make me see you'll support what I need instead of rolling your eyes and complaining about a 30sec task. Every morning I love my cup of coffee, ive told you how much is helps me feel grounded. If you made me one, without me asking, once in a while, I would feel so warm inside. I would feel so loved. I want you to ask me ""what's wrong hun"" every now and then, instead of waiting for me to come to you all the time, then use it against me. You know im socially awkward, I want you to invite me to sit next to you during gatherings, not just leave me stranded. Or maybe you can make it a point to sit next to me, not just the most available seat. I would love it if you did chores on your own, without me asking you to do so. It would make me feel less like a maid/boss. If you took on some of my tasks, or offered to help me with my laundry when im overwhelmed, it would make me feel so incredibly supported.

Just like how when you talk about something coming up, or a task you want to do, I'll write a reminder for MYSELF because I know you can be forgetful. Just like when you need to rush out the door in the morning, I'll slingshot out of bed and pack a quick lunch and fill you up a water to help you out. I'll ask you ""what's going on"" whenever I get a HINT of you being out of it. I'll offer to make you a cup of coffee, even though you don't drink it as consistently as I do. I'll pick up your clothes off the ground when I notice the laundry is overwhelming you. I'll take on some of your tasks when I see you overwhelmed. Ill make sure you get a spot at the end of the table so you can have the extra leg room because of how tall you are. I don't want you to feel cramped. 

I want us to be a team. I want us to care about the little things. I want us to DO the little things. I want us to care about our quirks. A team helps each other, not against.

1lzc50d,https://i.redd.it/8ch1s2hffrcf1.jpeg,Custom Game Mode,"Hey guys!

My favorite part of this game is the campaign expansion. I own all of them expect agents of shield which is coming later this week. But while waiting I’ve come up with my own way to build out custom campaigns that feel fun and rewarding that I’ve been running for the past few weeks. I’ve been calling it multiversal madness. 

Here’s the rules for those who are interested:

First off everything is randomized. I put all my hero’s, villains, and scenarios all into separate wheels and press spin. I select 5 villains and 4 hero’s for each campaign. Each villain gets random scenarios based on its set up. For example, Ultron would get its Ultron deck, standard, and one random scenario. But a villain like venom would get its venom deck, standard, symbiotic strength, and one random scenario since symbiotic strength is named in its setup. 

Every hero also gets a randomized aspect and each aspect is only used once unless the hero allows multiple aspects for its deck building. This keeps deck building fun, interesting, and challenging when using aspect that maybe a hero isn’t too great in. 

Then pick one of your villains the be the main villain and set them aside. 

The game is then split up into 2 phases

Phase 1: One on Ones 

A hero is matched up with one of the other 4 villains, chosen at random or at the players discretion, I usually pick who battles who so I can create some sort of overarching storyline. If that hero successfully defeats its villain, the move onto the final battle. If that hero loses they are not included in the final battle and a penalty is then added to the final battle. If all 4 hero’s lose to their villains the game is over and the main villain wins. 

Phase 2: The Final Battle 

This is when the hero’s fight off again that set aside villain. Whether it be 1 on 1 or if you’re lucky enough 4 on 1. Who ever wins this fight wins it all! 

Like I said before there are penalties if a hero doesn’t defeat their villain to make the final battle a bit more interesting
If 1 hero loses: add an extra scenario to the final battle
If 2 hero’s lose: you must fight villain phase 1 and 3 (I usually play standard)
If 3 hero’s lose: the last hero remaining has their nemesis deck shuffled into the encounter deck from the start and their nemesis starts engaged with them 
If all 4 hero’s lose: GAME OVER 

I’ve also been experimenting with rewards for if a hero wins their one on one battle:

If a hero wins their battle: they get to pick an additional upgrade from their aspect that they are allowed to start with from setup 
If all 4 hero’s make it to the final battle each get an additional +1 in hand size

And that’s it. It’s meant to be a fun new creative way to play my favorite game and I’m have so much fun with it I thought I’d share. But like I said I like to make over arching storylines for each campaign here’s the one for this week. 

Villains:
-Rhino (future past)
-Mansion attack (whispers of paranoia)
-Venom (Infinites)
-Juggernaut (exodus)
-Ultron (Sentinels)

Hero’s:
-Hulk (Protection)
-Cyclops (Leadership)
-Spider-Man (Justice)
-Magik (Aggression)

The x-men and avengers world collide when in this universe(HCSMM), Ultron is awoken from a deep sleep and tasked to eradicate all mutants before they can destroy this planet. Chaos soon rings out across all of New York City as Ultron uses his drones and newly made sentinels to track any mutants down and kill on sight. 

Ultron enlists the help of the brotherhood and mysterio to attack Xavier’s institute to get as many mutants as possible but Scott Summers, who was already on campus, is there to defend the school he’s sworn to protect. 

It didn’t take much convincing for bastion to soon join Ultron mission. With a little help from rhino (this is New York City after all) they’re tasked with creating a diversion to attract the attention of any hero’s who may be lurking around. Unluckily for them Bruce banner just finished up a meeting and was having a coffee break right outside avengers tower. 

Scott had let illyana know of the attack on the school as soon as the brotherhood came within a 10 mile radius and tasked her with finding hope summer as soon as possible. When she did, she found that juggernaut with the help of exodus had already taken hope and were planning their next move

Peter and eddy were already having their normal weekend brawl when all of the sudden a portal opened and infinites started marching out chanting “clean the gene pool” eddy only knew they could help out number spider man

Will this team of hero’s scattered across New York save this universe? Or will all the mutants perish and Ultron reign supreme?

If you made it this far thank you for reading! This has been a really creative way for me to enjoy my nights. Like I said it’s all for fun! I love this game and I wanted to share with other people who also feel the same way. ",1,1752464073.0,marvelchampionslcg,0,1.0,False

1lzc30o,https://i.redd.it/tyanoqdwercf1.jpeg,From fake to Fabulous: All Heiress Family Reunion,"Chapter 1 A Fateful Departure
The sun was setting on Rosalie Moreno's life with the Moreno family, and she had hoped for a silent farewell. But as she tiptoed towards the door, ready to vanish into the dusk, Jennifer Moreno, her adoptive mother, summoned her with a voice that cut through the quiet.

In the living room, Yuri Moreno, the family's true daughter, nestled close to Yosef Lennon, the Lennons' indulged scion, on the couch. A pang of realization struck Rosalie—her presence was surplus.

The Morenos and Lennons had a marriage pact, and Yosef, who'd boasted of claiming Rosalie as his bride since their school days, was now smitten with Yuri, who'd returned only a week ago. It wasn't Rosalie he desired; it was the Moreno name.

Jennifer wasted no time in confirming Rosalie's suspicions. ""Rosalie, can't you see? Yuri and Yosef are a match made in heaven. You and Yosef were never meant to be, but they... they're perfect together.""

""Love can't be forced; it's fate,"" Jennifer continued, her tone softening. ""Don't cling to Yosef out of habit. They'll be engaged before you know it.""

Rosalie raised a skeptical eyebrow. ""Tell that to Yosef. He's the one who can't let go. I've never been interested."" She had seen through Yosef's grand gestures long ago; he was nothing more than a plaything to her.

Yosef, who'd endured Rosalie's disdain for years, harbored a grudge. Seeing her still acting with an air of superiority, even after losing her Moreno status, he sneered, ""You're just a nobody, yet you talk so big.

""No wonder I never liked you. You're a fake! Thank God we weren't engaged. I'd be stuck with you and your replacement!""

Yosef sneered at Rosalie with a look of utter disdain, yet a tinge of regret lingered in his heart. Rosalie's beauty and figure were leagues beyond Yuri's, a fact that was hard to ignore. He thought it was such a shame that Rosalie wasn't the true-born daughter of the Moreno family.

Rosalie's retorted, ""That's what I'm saying! Thank God someone else is taking you off my hands, or I'd have to look at your pockmarked face forever.""

Yosef's face, scarred by acne, twisted in anger at Rosalie's jab.

Yuri, feigning concern at Yosef's mockery, played the peacemaker. ""Yosef, don't be so harsh. She might get hurt. After all, if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have taken you or the Moreno heiress spot from her.

""She's just lashing out because she's hurting inside. Can't you cut her some slack?"" Yuri's voice dripped with false sympathy.

Rosalie wasn't buying it. ""I'm not upset. This loser chased me for years, and I never cared. But you? A week back and you're already with him. Trash and a schemer—made for each other!""

Jennifer exploded at that, ""You heartless girl! Why are you so rude? No wonder I could never get close to you; you're naturally disrespectful.

""You lived a life of luxury for eighteen years while Yuri suffered. And now you insult her? That's outrageous!""

Rosalie, reprimanded by Jennifer, remained unflustered. Everything she had with the Moreno family, she'd earned through her secret contributions to the family's business.

Curtis Moreno, Rosalie's adoptive father, had saved enough to start a factory but lacked the business acumen to keep it afloat.

Without Rosalie's secret help, the factory would have folded, and the Moreno family wouldn't have become one of Serenity District's top merchants. But Rosalie never bragged; they were clueless about her role as the factory's biggest backer.

Curtis, dragged into the downstairs fray, frowned on purpose, playing the peacemaker.

Curtis pretended to blame Jennifer. ""Come on, that's not how you talk to Rosalie. She's going back to her family today, facing tough times. Besides, we messed up eighteen years ago; it's not her fault. Can't let her leave broken-hearted, right?""

Curtis, though hypocritical, had a fair point. But looking at Rosalie, his feelings were mixed.

He loved Rosalie since she was a kid—charming and lovely. But if she hadn't been with them, they wouldn't have missed their real daughter for eighteen years, suffering away from home.

Curtis let out a sigh as he spoke to Rosalie. ""Rosalie, you're not my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. You're like my own kid.""

""I've done some checking. Your real folks are out of work. If you ever need something, don't hesitate to come back and ask for help,"" Curtis added, feigning kindness.

Jennifer, sitting close by, jumped up and nudged Curtis. ""Why are you being so generous? Watch out you don't end up with a freeloader! Parents without jobs—what kind of decent family is that?""

Rosalie looked at the Morenos' fake smiles and Yosef, her face blank as she said, ""No thanks, Mr. Moreno. But you might want to focus more on running the factory and the company, especially keep an eye on the people around you.""

Rosalie glanced at Jennifer, a hint of warning in her voice.

There was a real snake in the grass at the company. Jennifer and her brother had been siphoning off money for years. If Rosalie hadn't been watching them, they might have bled the company dry.

If her birth family was really struggling, Rosalie figured she wouldn't have time to deal with the Morenos' drama.

Jennifer exploded at her words, ""So you can't stand to see us doing well, can you? Even as you're leaving, you have to curse our business. Like you've ever managed the factory! What are you even bragging about?""

Rosalie knew arguing with Jennifer was a waste of time, so she just snorted, ""You'll see what I'm capable of soon enough.""

Not wanting to waste any more breath, Rosalie stood up, slung her only backpack over her shoulder, and headed for the door. Inside was just her ID and the laptop she'd bought herself. She wasn't taking anything else.

But Yosef had to get in his digs. ""Mr. and Mrs. Moreno, Rosalie didn't even bring her luggage. Who knows what valuables she's got in that bag. You'd better check it!""

Jennifer, taking the bait, immediately said, ""Yosef's right! Open it up and see what's inside!""

Chapter 2 The Enigmatic Ride
Yuri feigned concern with a practiced sigh. ""Mother, is this truly necessary? Rosalie's family is in dire straits. Even if she took a trinket or two, it's but a drop in the ocean for us. Can't we show some compassion?""

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Everything in her room was a gift from us. How dare she use our generosity to sustain her family? Her parents, jobless and adrift—will a few baubles truly make a difference?""

As she spoke, Jennifer advanced on Rosalie's backpack, intent on exposing her supposed thievery.

Rosalie, anticipating Jennifer's petty invasion, unzipped her bag with a flourish. ""Here, see for yourselves. No Moreno trinkets grace this bag. My ID is my own, and the laptop and clothes I wear were bought with the money I earned from my scholarship.""

If Rosalie hadn't been funneling her earnings to support her family, she would have flaunted her wealth in their faces. But they weren't worth the satisfaction.

Seeing the backpack's contents, Yuri and Yosef exchanged glances of disappointment. They hadn't expected Rosalie to have such integrity.

As the Morenos stood speechless, Rosalie slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to make her exit.

Suddenly, a frail figure descended the stairs with urgency. ""Rosalie... wait for me...""

The Morenos whirled in shock to see Yancy Moreno, fresh from surgery, hastening down the stairs.

Jennifer rushed to support her son, her voice laced with panic. ""Yancy, you should be resting! Why have you left your bed?""

Yancy, battling severe aplastic anemia, had undergone a bone marrow transplant by a mysterious doctor. Though the surgery was successful, he was still fragile, needing to avoid stress and exertion. They had kept him from Rosalie, but he defied their wishes.

Rosalie's heart, usually encased in ice, wavered at the sight of Yancy, the one who had always been weak yet her staunch protector.

At that moment, Yancy glared at Jennifer, his voice sharp. ""If you hadn't confined me, I wouldn't have had to rush."" The butler, under orders, had barred his way, but Yancy had slipped past. Luckily, Rosalie was still within reach.

Without delay, Yancy produced a card and pressed it into Rosalie's hand. ""Rosalie, I've heard about your family's plight. I've set aside some savings over the years. Please, take this, should you find yourself in need.""

Holding the card, Rosalie felt a warmth in her chest. In a family of strangers, Yancy was the only one who truly cared. It made all her efforts—researching his illness, ensuring his surgery's success—worthwhile. Now, as she left, Yancy was her only concern.

Seeing Yancy's generosity, Jennifer's face pinched with anxiety. ""You foolish boy, that's your only card, with at least ten grand in it! Why give it to her? She's not even your real sister!""

Yuri, feigning innocence, couldn't help but worry. ""Wow, Yancy is so generous to Rosalie. I've been home for days, and he hasn't even spoken to me much.""

Yosef, sensing Yuri's slight, immediately defended her. ""Come on, man, that's just too biased! You're so cold to your own sister, yet you lavish attention on that impostor.""

""You!"" Yancy fumed, his anger palpable.

Seeing Yancy upset, Rosalie's eyes darkened. She snatched a glass of water and splashed it directly in Yosef's face.

""Hey! Rosalie! How dare you!"" Yosef, heir to the Lennon family, had never been so humiliated, and he shouted in rage.

But Rosalie's gaze was icy. ""Yosef, this is the Moreno residence. Who are you to yell at the head of the Moreno family? Yancy just had surgery and can't afford the stress. Watch your tongue!""

Yosef, used to leveraging his family's friendship with the Morenos, often lingered at their home. Initially to pester Rosalie, he had lately shamelessly attached himself to Yuri, growing presumptuous, even daring to disrespect Yancy. He truly overstepped.

Realizing his blunder and noting the displeasure on Curtis and Jennifer's faces, Yosef retreated.

Yuri seized the moment to stir trouble. ""Mother, Father, even if it's to defend Yancy, Rosalie's actions were outrageous. Splashing water on guests? That's beyond rude.""

Rosalie, unwilling to waste more breath on them, handed the card back to Yancy. ""Yancy, your health comes first. Use this for your supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Rosalie..."" Yancy tried to resist, but Rosalie's grip was firm. He couldn't break free.

Rosalie smiled sincerely at Yancy, ""I appreciate the thought, but Yancy, don't worry about me. I don't need money. It's you who needs to take care of your health when I'm gone."" With that, she released his hand.

Yancy, still worried, tried to insist, but Rosalie was already walking away with a casual stride.

Yosef, grumbling to himself, ""Not short on money? Even now, still pretending to be rich. Rosalie, you really know how to play the part!"" He had harbored this complaint for years and finally let it slip.

Yet, Yosef felt a twinge of discomfort. Rosalie's parting gesture—splashing water on him—left him feeling frustrated and exposed.

Seeing Yosef drenched, Yuri quickly offered a handkerchief to dry him off.

Jennifer, spying the card back in Yancy's possession, quickly snatched it. ""Thank goodness she had the decency to refuse. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.""

Outside, Rosalie noted the Moreno family's driver made no move to offer her a ride, so she decided to call an Uber. To her surprise, a sleek black sports car, its brand discreet yet its presence commanding, pulled up just then.

Though the car's logo was subtle, the engine's purr betrayed its exclusivity. Under the sunlight, the black paint gleamed with a brilliance that hinted at hidden luxury.

A glance at the tires and rims confirmed their high-end origins. This car was no ordinary vehicle; it was a custom creation by a wealthy individual, likely as valuable as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Rosalie assumed an important figure had arrived. But to her astonishment, the man who emerged was shabby, with dark circles under his eyes.

He appeared no more than a few years older than her, yet his unshaven face and disheveled appearance contrasted starkly with his bright, piercing eyes. Upon seeing Rosalie, his eyes widened in recognition. ""You must be Rosalie?""

Chapter 3 The Yoder Arrival
The man who stepped out of the unmarked luxury sports car was none other than Rosalie's biological brother, Zaki Yoder. His eyes widened at the sight of Rosalie, and he exclaimed, ""You and Mom... you two could pass for sisters.""

The Yoder family had planned for someone to collect Rosalie today. Zaki, having just wrapped up a high-stakes case, was on his way home for a much-needed break and decided to make a detour to pick up his long-lost sister.

He had half-expected to have to ask the Morenos to point out Rosalie, but the moment he saw her, he knew without a doubt that she was his sister.

Rosalie raised an eyebrow, skepticism etched on her face. ""You're my brother?""

""Indeed, I'm Zaki, your third brother,"" Zaki replied, stepping forward with a grin.

Then, a realization struck him. Glancing down, he remembered he had been tailing a drug lord for days, without sleep or a change of clothes, and he had come straight here. Exhausted, he had forgotten to stop and grab a fancy suit to make a good impression.

""Sorry, I was in a rush and forgot to change,"" Zaki said, the tough commander feeling oddly self-conscious for the first time in front of Rosalie.

Rosalie was about to dismiss it as no big deal when Yuri interjected from behind her, ""Oh my, where'd this vagrant come from? Security, why are you letting just anyone in?""

The Moreno family's gatekeeper hurried over, explaining, ""Miss, this gentleman claimed he was here to see Rosalie, so I let him through.""

Yuri feigned surprise and turned to Rosalie. ""Oh... Rosalie, I had no idea he is your family. Please disregard my earlier comment.""

Rosalie gave Yuri the cold shoulder. ""If you're truly sorry, the best thing you can do is be quiet. No one wants to hear your incessant chatter."" With that, she walked past, opened Zaki's car door, and tossed her bag inside.

At that moment, Yosef arrived, seeking to settle a score. Seeing Zaki's beat-up car without a logo, he smirked. ""Never seen a car without a brand. Did you put this together yourself?""

Zaki leaned against the car, worn out, and replied, ""Yeah, it's custom."" They were a special forces team, and they all drove modified vehicles, especially this one, designed by his fifth brother, Kenneth Yoder.

Kenneth was still in school, but he was already a prodigy in weapon design for the Defense Department. His creations, once tweaked, were incredibly powerful and unmatched.

These cars could save a life in a tight spot. So, this car was worth more than any luxury car out there, and it hadn't come cheap.

But Yosef didn't understand and continued to mock Rosalie. ""I can't believe your family even has a car, but without a logo, who knows if it's stolen.""

Yuri chimed in, feigning concern, ""Rosalie, you should be careful. You could get entangled in some legal trouble!""

Rosalie had had enough of their nonsense, and now they were insulting her family. They had reached her limit.

Before Rosalie could speak, Zaki's face darkened. He strode over to them, his imposing figure over six feet tall as he towered over Yosef. Placing a heavy hand on Yosef's shoulder, Zaki said, ""Kid, you can't just run your mouth. Didn't anyone teach you that?""

After years of rigorous training and interrogating criminals, Zaki had earned the nickname ""Ice King."" His glare suggested Yosef might wet himself. Never had Yosef seen someone so intimidating. Yosef stammered, ""I-I-I was just guessing.""

Zaki snorted, ""Guessing? Sure, you can say what you want, but there's a price for every word. If your folks didn't teach you that, I can."" As he spoke, he squeezed Yosef's shoulder a bit harder.

In an instant, Yosef's shoulder popped out of its socket. He felt his arm go limp and screamed, ""Ouch! I won't do it again! Please, let me go!""

Zaki finally eased up, coldly putting Yosef's arm back in place.

Yosef was too terrified to utter a word.

Yuri, standing nearby, didn't fully grasp what had happened, but Yosef was pale as a ghost from the pain.

Zaki glanced at Yuri, causing her to shiver. His stare was absolutely terrifying.

""Young lady, I don't hit women. I'll let you slide today, but watch your mouth next time. I won't tolerate anyone cursing my family,"" Zaki said coldly.

Terrified, Yuri could only nod.

Zaki dialed back the intimidating aura and turned to Rosalie with a grin. ""Hey Rosalie, let's bounce.""

Rosalie gazed at Zaki's grin, seeing a totally different guy from the tough character he'd just played. She knew Zaki was definitely not someone to mess with.

Since he'd already shown Yosef and Yuri who was boss, Rosalie decided to play it cool. ""Alright, Zaki."" With that, she hopped into the car cheerfully.

Zaki, not thinking much of it, agreed, slid into the driver's seat, buckled up, and drove off from the Moreno residence. All that was left were Yuri and Yosef, staring in shock as the car vanished into the distance.

""Who is that guy really..."" Yosef muttered, feeling his arm had healed, but the fear from moments before still lingered in his heart.

Yuri shook her head. ""I don't know either, but the license plate seemed to be from Janivelle. And it looked like a police plate too."" It was puzzling; Zaki looked so scruffy, and yet he was driving a police car from Janivelle.

""You must have seen it wrong,"" Yosef shook his head. He had been too scared to notice those details, but he was sure she must have missed it.

Rosalie's original family was supposedly all out of work—there was no way that they could afford a car with Janivelle plates. After all, only locals could use Janivelle license plates.

Getting a residency permit in Janivelle was not something just anyone could do. Even with all the Moreno family's money, they still had out-of-town plates. They bet Rosalie's family must be really poor; there was no way they were locals from Janivelle.

Chapter 4 Her Family Is Super Loaded
In the car, Zaki felt a bit awkward and said to Rosalie, ""Sorry, Rosalie, I was in such a rush I forgot to bring a change of clothes. I'm a bit messy, and now people are talking about you because of me.""

Zaki really didn't care about what he wore or used, but he couldn't afford to embarrass Rosalie.

Rosalie shook her head understandingly. ""It's fine, as long as the clothes are comfy.""

Zaki felt a bit warmer towards Rosalie. But when he noticed she only had one backpack, he couldn't help but ask, ""Rosalie, didn't you bring any luggage? Just this one bag?""

Rosalie nodded, her tone cool. ""I don't want anything from the Moreno family.""

Zaki, being good at reading people, noticed the displeasure in Rosalie's tone, and his gaze cooled a bit. He quickly said, ""It's alright. Once we're home, anything you need, I will buy for you.""

Rosalie gave a gentle smile. ""Okay."" No matter what her family's real situation was, at least Zaki genuinely cared for her.

Rosalie noticed the route Zaki was taking and couldn't help but ask, ""Zaki, isn't this road leading to Oceanside Manor?""

Oceanside Manor was home to the wealthiest and most influential people in Janivelle. The manor was huge, almost taking up the whole East District. As people went up the hill, they passed by groups of big mansions and a few fancy estates.

Even though the Moreno family moved to Janivelle not too long ago, they had already figured out their main goal was to get close to the ten ancient families of Janivelle, all gathered in the East District.

Unfortunately, the road leading to the hill was lined with checkpoints. Without an invitation from a property owner within the mansion district, entry to Oceanside Manor was not allowed.

However, their car paused briefly at a checkpoint, the license plate was identified, and they were immediately granted access.

Zaki casually replied, ""Yeah, Mom and Dad are waiting for you at home.""

Rosalie couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the fact—her house was actually in Oceanside Manor.

At this moment, Rosalie started to question Curtis's investigation. Curtis had said that her parents and brothers were all unemployed. If that was the case, there was no way that her family could live in Oceanside Manor.

Rosalie frowned, thinking, 'Curtis has always been unreliable in getting things done. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to manage the company behind the scenes. He probably assumed they were unemployed and jumped to conclusions.

'But that's fine. Since my family is quite well-off, I don't need to worry about supporting them anymore.'

As they drove past several small villas, she thought the car would stop, but it didn't. When she saw a large villa, she couldn't help but think, 'It seems like my family is richer than I thought.'

Yet Zaki's car continued for another ten minutes, exiting the villa area and heading straight into the manor district. Rosalie narrowed her eyes, thinking, 'It seems my new home is exceptionally wealthy!'

But just as she was settling into her thoughts, the car kept going. It eventually drove all the way to the top of the mountain.

Oceanside Manor was named so because the road at its peak had no barriers, and clear seas stretch out on both sides.

At the end of this road, there was just one mega mansion. This was also a landmark people can spot from downtown Janivelle, the Skyline Castle.

It was a landmark because Skyline Castle sat at the peak of Janivelle, and people can spot this castle-like building from way off in the city center.

This place was said to be personally managed by a world-class designer, making it a super luxurious and modern landmark.

Inside this grand castle, people can catch the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most beautiful sunset over the sea at night, which was why it was named after this stunning view.

The owner of this place was a mystery. It was rumored that even the ten most prestigious families in Janivelle couldn't touch them. Yet, no one really knew who owned Skyline Castle.

They say the owner was incredibly wealthy, with investments all over the place. But they didn't run a family business; instead, top managers and stewards handled everything.

So, this mansion's owner had never shown their face, and nobody knew the true identity of their family members.

Just when Rosalie thought Zaki was just showing her the view and would soon head to another villa area, Zaki surprised her by driving straight into this museum-like estate.

In the sunlight, the fountain at the center of the estate splashed water in all directions, reflecting bright rays. The sculpture in the middle was actually a masterpiece by a famous modern artist, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Rosalie, who was used to appraising valuable artifacts, thought the sculpture was truly exceptional.

At this moment, Zaki's car slowly stopped at the front entrance of the castle. Before Rosalie could gather her thoughts, Zaki got out and, with a gentlemanly flair, opened her door. ""Welcome home, Rosalie.""

As soon as he finished speaking, over twenty servants lined up on both sides of the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison and said, ""Welcome home!""

For a moment, Rosalie felt like she had stepped onto a movie set.

""Zaki... Is this... my house? Really?"" Even though Rosalie wasn't short on money and had seen plenty of influential people, she was still a bit shocked.

After all, she was prepared for her family to be broke, with her parents and siblings all jobless, relying on her to support them. She never expected a complete turnaround. Her family turned out to be the legendary top-tier mysterious billionaires of Janivelle.

Chapter 5 Back Home
Zaki looked at Rosalie's somewhat surprised expression and smiled warmly, ""Yes, this is your home. Go on in, Mom and Dad are waiting for you.""

Rosalie composed herself and got out of the car, glancing at the extravagant red carpet beneath her feet, feeling a bit awkward as she walked up. ""Isn't this a bit too much?""

Zaki smiled, ""It's important."" After all, Rosalie had been through so many hardships over the years. Her first time home should be celebrated.

While they were speaking, two figures dashed out from the grand doors at the end of the red carpet. ""Is that Rosalie?!"" A voice filled with excitement and melody called out.

Rosalie looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple dress, yet she was elegant and ladylike. Although she was over forty, she maintained herself very well, resembling a famous actress, gentle and charming.

Beside the woman was a charismatic middle-aged man, standing tall and handsome, looking very much like Zaki. Rosalie could immediately tell that this couple must be her parents.

They were looking like a wealthy couple, having nothing related to the broke couple Curtis had mentioned.

At this moment, Roxanne Yoder had already reached Rosalie, grabbing her hand with tears in her eyes. ""That's it... this is truly my daughter. Zachary, look at how much she looks like me, right?""

Zachary Yoder was equally surprised as he looked at Rosalie and Roxanne's strikingly similar faces and agreed, ""Yeah, she really looks a lot like you.""

Roxanne was once an internationally renowned superstar, known for her stunning and unique beauty.

Initially, no one suspected their daughter Xyliana Yoder had been switched at birth. But when puberty hit, and Xyliana started to look less like Roxanne and Zachary, people began to whisper, and they felt something was wrong.

They didn't expect that shortly into their investigation, the Moreno family would discover the mistaken swap, and the police confirmed it with DNA tests between them and Rosalie, finally confirming Rosalie was indeed their biological daughter.

Initially, they planned to conduct a DNA test after Rosalie returned home, but now it seemed unnecessary. Rosalie looked exactly like a younger version of Roxanne, without any makeup, yet she exuded breathtaking beauty and pure charm.

Rosalie couldn't believe how much she looked like her mother either.

Jennifer had always kept Rosalie at arm's length because she was cute and pretty from a young age, and as she grew, she became stunningly beautiful.

Jennifer even wondered if Rosalie was really her own daughter. Driven by these doubts, Jennifer started investigating, and to her surprise, her suspicions were confirmed.

Rosalie felt that she truly found her biological parents.

""Dad, Mom, the wind is strong outside, let's go inside and talk."" Being at a seaside mansion, the sea breeze was indeed strong. Zaki gently reminded Roxanne, worried she might catch a cold.

Roxanne nodded excitedly. ""Yes, yes, I was so excited I forgot! Let's go in,"" she said, grabbing Rosalie's hand as they walked inside.

Rosalie felt Roxanne's soft and warm hand, and a wave of warmth spread through her heart. Having been resented by Jennifer since childhood, Rosalie rarely experienced a mother's care and love. Now she could finally feel just how comforting her mother's warmth was.

They walked in together. First, they went through the foyer. Even though it was just a small entrance hall, it felt like an art gallery, with walls covered in paintings, and in front of them, various pottery and sculptural artworks were displayed.

As Rosalie passed by one of the pottery pieces, she paused for a moment. She pondered, 'This piece of art looks so familiar.'

Noticing Rosalie's gaze, Roxanne quickly asked, ""Rosalie, do you like this artwork?""

Rosalie paused for a moment, feeling awkward, and just nodded. She replied in her heart, 'Of course, I like it. I made it.'

However, with so many artworks she finished each month, she usually just packed them up and had her assistant take them to her art studio to sell.

This particular piece only took her three hours at most to finish. She never thought it would end up at her parents' house.

Roxanne said, ""If you like it, feel free to put it in your room. It's the masterpiece of a mysterious new artist. I bought it a month ago at a charity auction for 3 million dollars. It wasn't expensive, but it's quite creative.""

Hearing this, Rosalie's lips twitched, thinking, '3 million dollars, and it is not expensive?'

Although the Moreno family was among the top three wealthy families in Serenity District, they couldn't just easily spend 3 million dollars on such a small piece of art. And it was something Rosalie created on a whim. She couldn't help but guess how rich her family was.

They all moved to the main hall, where several servants were lined up on either side.

Ten of them were holding trays with various drinks. Even the coffee had several types, while another group carried assorted snacks.

Roxanne walked by with Rosalie and said softly, ""Since it's your first time home, I didn't know what you like to drink, so we made all sorts of coffee. We've also got a variety of juices. Just choose what you like.

""And over here are the pastries from Janivelle's best bakeries. I got one of each flavor for you to taste, so feel free to try them.""

Seeing Roxanne's eager eyes, Rosalie had to choose a cup of freshly ground coffee and two pastries. ""I don't like it too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors are just perfect.""

Roxanne was immediately overjoyed. ""I never would have guessed that our tastes are so similar.""

The selected servant brought the pastries, while the others left.

Zaki then said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to change my clothes.""

Zachary looked at Zaki's messy appearance and sighed, ""You're now the leader of Special Unit A of Interpol! What kind of case would make you personally lead a team to such an extent? If I'd known you looked like this, I wouldn't have sent you to pick up Rosalie. What if you scared her?""

Zaki felt embarrassed. ""We were capturing an international drug lord this time. It wasn't just me; even the deputy chief personally led the operation.""

Chapter 6 Money Isn't An Issue
Zaki said in embarrassment, ""But I was really in such a hurry that I forgot to change clothes.""

Zaki, the cold-faced war hero secretly trained by the international police's special forces, would be scolded like this at home. He could only apologize and admit his mistake. ""It's my fault. I'll go change first, wait for me, Rosalie."" With that, Zaki made a quick exit.

Zachary sighed helplessly and said to Rosalie, ""Zaki is just like that. He has no sense of style every time he gets home from a mission. Don't be scared.""

Rosalie wasn't scared at all; she was surprised. She had never expected Zaki to be the leader of a special forces team of the international police.

Rosalie felt a bit jittery and gulped. Over the past couple of years, she'd been sneaking into different systems and networks for the global cops. She even whipped up the new firewall they just installed.

Thank goodness the person she'd been chatting with wasn't Zaki. If it had been, her secret would've been out. She made up her mind to use a voice changer next time she contacted them.

Lost in thought, she brought her coffee cup to her lips. As she took a sip, she noticed the coffee beans tasted familiar. The coffee at her parents' house all came from her private farm overseas.

Surprised, she couldn't help but take another sip. It had to be right. The taste of this coffee bean was unique to her farm. She had discovered a special kind of coffee bean to make a buck and deliberately created a luxury vibe, catering to the rich through scarcity marketing, even doing limited releases.

Rosalie never thought her parents would be one of her clients. Just thinking about how she might have been making money from her own birth parents all these years—it was both weird and complicated. She should find an excuse to send them more freebies when she got the chance.

""Rosalie, what's on your mind? Is the coffee not good?"" Roxanne asked, noticing Rosalie holding the coffee cup for a long time without taking a sip, thinking it might taste off.

Rosalie quickly shook her head and smiled, ""No, it's great. I love freshly ground coffee."" Then she added in her heart, thinking, 'How could it be bad? I personally picked the coffee beans and grew them myself, making sure the variety and flavor are truly one-of-a-kind.'

Seeing Rosalie enjoy it, Roxanne smiled gently, ""Alright, if you like it, I can grind it for you in the future.""

Feeling a warm sensation in her heart from Roxanne's gentle demeanor, Rosalie couldn't bring herself to say no. Her tone even turned a bit playful. ""Okay... if you grind it, I bet it tastes amazing.""

Rosalie's smile instantly melted Roxanne's heart. Thinking of this, she couldn't help but reach out to hug Rosalie. ""Rosalie, I'm so sorry. I never imagined I could have mistaken my own child. It's my fault for realizing it so late, making you suffer so much,"" Roxanne said, her voice choked with emotion.

Feeling the warmth of her mother's embrace, Rosalie's heartbeat surprisingly calmed down. She whispered, ""Mom, it's okay. I didn't go through too much hardship. My adoptive parents treated me quite well.""

Curtis was pretty decent to Rosalie. Even though Jennifer couldn't bring herself to be very affectionate, she still took care of Rosalie, which was quite good.

""Really?"" Roxanne slowly released Rosalie, her eyes full of grievance, and said, ""Zaki helped me investigate. He found out that the family you grew up with didn't have much money and only recently moved to a small neighborhood in Janivelle. It's true you rarely bought bags and shoes, right?""

After hearing that, Rosalie could only give an awkward smile. ""Compared to our family... yeah, the Moreno family is indeed quite small, but it's okay. At least I don't need to worry about food and clothing.""

When it came to bags and shoes, Rosalie had never really liked them since she was young.

Her days were taken up with figuring out how to earn money to support the whole family and scraping together enough for Yancy's surgery and treatment bills. There simply wasn't any time to dress up.

Even though Rosalie said she wasn't worried about food and clothes, it sounded to Roxanne like she was just trying to be strong.

Over the years, Xyliana never went without clothes, shoes, bags, or jewelry at home—most were even limited editions or rare items. Compared to Xyliana's luxurious style, Rosalie's current outfit of a T-shirt, jeans, and white sneakers seemed much too plain.

""In front of us, you don't need to act tough. We will handle everything,"" Zachary said, looking at Rosalie with caring eyes.

When Roxanne thought about how her daughter didn't even have a few of those designer bags, clothes, and shoes that Xyliana had so many of, she couldn't help but look at Rosalie with pity in her eyes.

1lzc2zr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzc2zr,My Tricker's Ethan,"When I came across a photo of what would be a monkey boot on Instagram, I decided I wanted one. I browsed and found the monkey boot interpretation of XBX to be sleek, sexy, and beautifully crafted. I also like Tricker’s Ethan, but with the 9-pair eyelet version. Both versions are beyond my budget, so I decided to just set aside money every payday.

Fortunately, this pair came up in the secondhand market at just 10% of the retail price. The seller told me that he bought the pair when he visited Japan. Though it is not the taller version, as you can see, it is the 7-eyelet version, I immediately closed the deal. The seller agreed to deliver the boots to my workplace, and then the waiting game began. 

The seller arrived, and I immediately checked the pair. The pair is in excellent condition, except for some minor scuffs. For the price, great deal!

The Boots

This is a monkey boots by Tricker’s. It is called Ethan. On the Tricker’s website, it says that the Ethan Monkey Boot features seven eyelets and a half-bellows tongue. The history of the humble Monkey Boot dates back to World War 2, worn as standard issue by the Czechoslovakian army, their durability, practicality, and the fact they were inexpensive made them the ideal boot for the foot soldier.

The Leather

The leather is called espresso burnished. Indeed, the color is similar to an espresso coffee. It invokes images of rich and darker coffee tones. The color can be characterized as between black and brown. The leather is polished to shine, hence, burnished. 

If I had to be honest, if I had the money to buy a brand new pair, I would have chosen the Marron Antique. But for the price and the experience this pair offers, I could not be happier. The color grows on me. I love the way it kind of shines when exposed outside the sun. Although the leather is not so thick, it still feels sturdy but strangely supple (if I am making sense).

The Fit

The last used in this pair is 5402R. According to Tricker’s, this last is true to size and recommends sticking to the regular UK size. I have a pair of Bourton (UK7 fit 5) and Wychwood (UK8 fit 5). Bourton’s last is 4444, so you have to size down a half. Wychwood is made in 4497s, also true to size. This Ethan is size 8.5UK fit 5, so it is a bit roomy for me, and so I have to use my thicker socks. The thing about buying preloved shoes/boots, aside from the price, which is usually lower compared to brand new, I get to experience first how the shoes/boots really feel.

The Sole

The sole is in Dainite, so I can confidently wear it in the office since we are required to wear a smart-casual. I have service boots with thick Dr. Sole half soles. I also have a Mark McNairy in Ridgeway, Tricker’s Wychwood with leather soles, and Mark Albert Uptown in Vibram 2724. I prefer the Dainite here in my country. 

The Build

As usual, this Tricker’s is solidly built. Like my Bourton and Wychwood, this Ethan feels indestructible, so to speak. I am so impressed with Tricker’s.

1lzc2zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1lzc2zm/most_intense_pain_center_sternum_what_is_going_on/,Most intense pain center sternum - what is going on?,"Evening. This is long, apologies. 

I have always experienced HB when I have too much acidic items in a day and can generally take care of it with a couple Tums. 

I’ve now had 4 episodes of debilitating (assuming it’s HB) since June 8th.

June 8th, 3 mile run in AM, hydrate throughout day. Cup of coffee in morning with cereal for breakfast, another around 3, had spicy egg rolls for lunch, 3 slices of homemade pizza for dinner. Woke up at 2am in intense pain, with pressure dead center at bottom of sternum radiating to opposite side of my back. Ultimately got about 2 hours of sleep from the constant pacing. Took the day off work as the pain never subsided until my wife was able to bring home some stronger antacids (Gaviscon Extra Strength). By evening I felt perfectly fine.

June 20th - no run, homemade breakfast burrito, cup of coffee, lunch was a protein smoothie with banana and strawberries plus almond milk. Dinner was homemade hibachi. Woke up around 12am, pain lasted until about 5am but subsided enough to work.

July 7 (on vacation) - 3 mile run, cup of coffee, banana nut muffin , grouper sandwich and fries for lunch, blue Hawaiian drink, coffee at 4, homemade cheeseburger (plain) with fruit and a few chips at about 6. By 630, I could feel the pressure starting in the same spot as usual. Took Gaviscon, no relief. Ultimately ended up pacing through the night, was in a world of consistent pain and pressure all day on the 8th. Finally subsided by 4-5pm on the 8th.

I’ve completely cut coffee since the 7th. As well as greasy/fried foods, etc.

Today - multigrain Cheerios, milk and banana for bfast. Deli sandwich with grapes and mini carrots for lunch. Cup of caffeine free green tea with lunch. No snacks. Dinner was pan seared tilapia (small amount of olive oil used), jasmine rice and mixed veggies. Had a cup of triple zero Greek yogurt with a small amount of honey almond granola.

Within 5-10 minutes of finishing that yogurt, I could feel the pressure start. This time it came with the token burning sensation I did not truly feel the 3 prior episodes. It continued to well up from about 9pm to 9:30. I was pacing by that time wondering how the heck I’m feeling this bad for not having eaten bad since the 7th. I’ve felt relatively great since the 8th when the pain subsided and had just some burping each day, no other symptoms, able to run and bike without issue on a cleaner diet.

Took 3 Tums right away when I noticed the symptoms tonight. After about 30 min the pain and pressure became so intense I was borderline going to ask my wife to call an ambulance. Almost like my chest was going to pop. Then bam, it went away. I’m left with a mild burning/raw sensation behind my sternum at the lower part.

Otherwise I feel fine 

What the heck is going on with me? My wife is wondering if I have developed a dairy intolerance or GERD, gallbladder stones/attack. I’ve no idea. Naturally self research points to cancer so I’m trying to not catastrophize but the pain tonight was akin to nothing I’ve ever felt before and has me quite scared. I’m also down 8lbs since the 7th which is wild. Assuming it’s due to eating a lot less (didn’t eat at all on 8th, had some bread on 9th and then a banana and 2 slices of plain bread for dinner)

Making an appt with a gastroenterologist tomorrow to hopefully get some insight.

**All In**

My eyes were bloodshot. Pins and needles prickled through my limbs, starting in my fingertips and spreading down to my toes. Three days. It had been three days since Chris was taken, three days without sleep, staying ever vigilant, tracking the movements of the newly increased staff. I downed another shot of espresso, the bitter taste no longer a shock, only feeding the nervous energy twisting inside me. My brain screamed for rest, but every time I closed my eyes, paranoia clawed at the back of my mind. Did the staff notice what I was doing? Why did that passenger look at me like that? Could she be working for the bus? My pulse quickened. I shook my head violently, trying to knock the cobwebs loose. I needed to focus.

My plan was starting to come together, but everything felt more fragile with each passing minute. Since Chris was taken, the staff had ramped up their presence, standing like sentinels to keep the peace. The once impenetrable door was now doubly fortified, with more guards constantly watching. I noted every shift change, every step they took, scanning for a weak point in their routine, anything I could exploit. The other passengers? They had retreated further into themselves, more distant and detached than ever, their apathy gnawing at my already frayed nerves.

I couldn’t take this much longer. My mind was unraveling. I had to act, and I had to do it tonight. As far as plans go, I thought, mine wasn't terrible. First, I needed to collect all of my things so that I could act at a moment's notice. Second, I needed to wait until dinner. For the last few days, the staff had been more lax while placing food out on the buffet. And thankfully, the passengers were too scared to say anything even if they were to notice me. Third, while the staff were preoccupied setting out the food, I would sneak into the staff access corridor. It was risky, but I figured the hall would be relatively empty because the staff would be feeding other passengers. Fourth, hope for the best. As the thought hit me, I slumped in my seat. A lot of this plan revolved around ifs and did little to set my slipping sanity at ease.

Little by little, I grabbed my belongings, taking my time to hopefully not attract any attention. Dinner was drawing near, and my knees began to shake, and my palms began to sweat. Adrenaline was coursing through my entire body all at once, causing me to feel queasy. I looked down at my watch, 7:27 PM, I had just over thirty minutes to go over my plan one last time to make final preparations. I headed back to my secluded seat to wait out what time I had left when I noticed someone waiting for me. Alarm bells in my brain rang incessantly. Had someone discovered my plan? How? My face turned white as a sheet, and I nearly vomited where I stood. I had to keep my composure; no one knew anything. How could they? I hadn't spoken to anyone in days. As I neared the seat, I saw it was the old man from a few days ago.

""Oh, hey there, youngster."" He greeted. ""I seen you been awful quiet these last couple days. I hope I ain't intrudin' or nothin.'""

""No, not intruding. Just getting ready for dinner."" I said, with a forced grin.

""I'm sorry for all your friends gettin' nabbed, I know this place can get kinda lonely.""

""Oh, it's, uh...it's nothing,"" I muttered, nervousness straining my vocal cords.

""Nonsense, I seen it's been eating you up, and I'd hate for you to make the same mistake that young lady did."" I nearly fainted from fright. Was he on to me? ""I just wanted to stop by and say that if you need anything, I can always make time to chat. I ain't been able to sleep good since what's 'er name up n left, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I let it happen again."" I stifled a sigh of relief when it dawned on me that he knew nothing about my plan, but a pang of guilt loomed heavily on my shoulders. When I leave, will this kind old man blame himself? Before I could say anything else, the sound of carts being pushed down the hall echoed throughout the cabin. I looked down at my watch, 8:00 on the dot. Time was of the essence so my conscience had to wait. I thanked the man for his concern and quickly brushed past him.

I clutched my bag with a death grip, almost as if I strangled it hard enough, it would increase my chances of success. My temples pulsed with adrenaline as I stealthily moved up the aisle. My heart thumped like a war drum with each step, but I remained on guard; none of the staff's movements went unnoticed. When suddenly a staff member locked eyes with me. For an endless second, their gaze felt like it burned right through me, making me uneasy, as if they could read my mind. I quickly popped into a crowd of people, hoping it would mask my intentions, my eyes locked on the staff corridor. A bead of sweat rolled down my forehead into my eye. I released a breath I wasn't aware I was holding, trying in vain to calm my blazing nerves. I moved with the mass of people like a herd of cattle being brought to a feeding trough. Feeling sufficiently incognito, I poked my head out of the crowd, scanning the room for any staff looking my way. To my utter horror, however, I noticed something I had never seen before. There was a guard at the access door. My heart sank, and I paused. Every neuron in my brain fired all at once. There was no way I could get in there undetected. No way unless... Without thinking, I screamed, ""Stop shoving me!"" and wildly pushed a passenger into a staff member rolling a food cart. Food exploded everywhere, plates clattering to the ground. Gasps and shouts filled the air as passengers stumbled over each other in the chaos. The staff member’s face twisted in annoyance as they bent to clean up the mess, giving me the window I needed.

I slunk back into the crowd of people, hoping no one would pin the incident on me and be able to sneak away from the crowd unnoticed. I held my breath, willing myself invisible as I slipped from the edge of the fray. Once I emerged, everyone was focused on the mess. Everyone, including the guard. Absorbed in the chaos, they took a precious second to turn their back on the door. Just the second I needed to close the gap and enter unnoticed. As quickly and quietly as the wind, I snuck to the door, fearing that any second, I would feel someone slam up against me like they did with Chris. But that moment never came. I reached the door unmolested and equally important unnoticed. I opened the door, grinning ear to ear. The sheer joy in my heart at the improbability of my plan working nearly made me scream, but my elation was quashed as I saw what lay in front of me.

The hall stretched endlessly in every direction, doors stacked on doors, walls twisting like veins in some enormous beast. Buzzing fluorescent lights cast cold, flickering shadows, each corner a portal to more uncertainty. It wasn’t just a corridor; it was a nightmare come to life. My stomach churned, and for the first time since stepping on this bus, I felt truly lost.

I gawked, mouth wide open, and a tear rolled down my face. Whatever this place was, I thought, it wasn't a bus. My stomach dropped, and a wave of terror rushed over me. I thought I’d been braced for anything, but this… I collapsed to the ground in a heap. Exhaustion had taken hold of me. It took every ounce of willpower I could muster to keep my eyes from closing. I gritted my teeth and forced myself into a sitting position. For an eternity, I sat there, not knowing what to do or where to go. I knew I couldn't stay, but I didn't know where to begin either. Chris and Misty could be anywhere if they were even still alive. The weight of realization hit me like a runaway train.

The walls seemed to close in on me, mockingly. I felt a lump in my throat form and tears would have followed if I hadn't been so utterly spent. Suddenly, the doorknob behind me rattled, and instinctively, I jumped to my feet and locked the door. I was no longer safe and had to make a decision. The rattling on the door became louder and louder. There was a door down the hall, not thirty feet away. I had no idea where it would lead me, but it was my only choice. With my energy reserves running on fumes, I raced as quickly as I could to the unknown door. I gripped the handle, my heart hammering against my ribs. Behind me, the rattling grew louder, more urgent, like the staff were seconds away from breaking through. I swallowed hard and pulled the door open, stepping into the unknown with nothing but a whispered prayer.

**Chapter 11**

**Ante Up**

I slammed the door behind me, chest heaving and hands shaking. I thought for sure someone would break down the door, and the staff would be on me any minute. But as the seconds came and went, I was met with nothing. Nothing but the sounds emanating from the new room I found myself in. It was dark. Perfect for hiding out until I could come up with a new plan. My legs felt like gelatin, and I wanted nothing more than to climb into my bed. I wobbled over to an unoccupied seat, barely able to register my surroundings, and flopped face-first onto the bench. The second I closed my eyes, consciousness left me, and I entered a deep, dreamless sleep.

**\*\*\***

""Hey, you!""

My heart leaped into my throat, and I jumped up from my slumber. I've been caught, I thought to myself. My eyes, still not adjusted from waking, couldn't quite make out the imposing figure in front of me. I stammered incoherently, madly rubbing my eyes to assess my surroundings. What stood in front of me, however, wasn't at all who I expected. It was, in fact, vaguely familiar.

""You gonna stand there and gawk at me, or you gonna let me bye? And why were you sleeping on my bag?"" The giant of a man asked, brows furrowed.

""I, uh,..."" I tried to form a coherent sentence, but the words wouldn't form.

""You uh? The fuck does that mean, you uh?""

""S...sorry, I didn't know this was yours. You're not with the staff?"" I asked, holding on to hope.

""What? No. But if I catch you messing with my shit again, you'll wish I was.""

""Again, I'm sorry. I didn't know this was yours."" I held out my hand in an attempt to smooth things over. ""My name is...""

""I don't care what your name is."" He interrupted. ""Just leave me alone. Go bother someone else.""

Perplexed and embarrassed, my cheeks turned a rosy red, and I stood there in stunned silence for a moment. I regained my bearings and, with a forced grin, walked past him. I was relieved he wasn't part of the staff, but his face, I could have sworn I had seen this man before. He had a sharp jawline like one carved from granite. His muscle definition put the Greek gods to shame, but for the life of me, I just couldn't place him.

Trying to shake off the unsettling encounter, I walked toward the front of the cabin. It was much larger than the last. It was colorful but dingy. The room was filled with the acrid stench of old cigarettes and the cacophonous sound of a casino. There had to be at least three hundred people in here, all of them glued to one game of chance or another. There were slot machines, card tables, roulette tables, and any other form of gambling you could think of. To call it overwhelming was an understatement.

My stomach rumbled, interrupting my train of thought, reminding me I had barely eaten the last few days. I neared the buffet, hoping to eat my fil,l but what lay before me was unappetizing, to say the least. The food looked like it had been sitting out for a day or two, yet my stomach groaned again, telling me I had little choice.

I grabbed what passed as food here and settled into a vacant seat, this time making sure there were no one's belongings around me. The pancakes I had tasted like cardboard, and the coffee like motor oil. Regardless, I scarfed them down with reckless abandon. As I ate, I glanced around the room and realized I was the only one not engrossed in a game.

The passengers' gaunt faces and glazed eyes gave the eerie impression they'd melded into the machines themselves. I watched the bizarre scene for some time, a sea of people going through the motions. A shiver ran down my spine as a grown man began blubbering in anguished sobs while his feeble arm reached for the lever.

Alarm bells began ringing in my head, begging me to run back to where I came from. But my mission still needed to be completed. No matter what, I needed to find Chris and Misty. I set my dishes down and straightened my clothes. It was time to ask around.

I walked toward a row of slot machines. Their garish lights flashed brightly, and their deafening chimes pounded relentlessly against my eardrums. A line of passengers sat quietly, playing their games. I was desperate to ask around but wary of drawing attention. I needed to blend in. Hesitantly, I fished a handful of coins from my pocket and inserted them into the machine. The lights flashed in a nauseating pattern before landing on two bells and a cherry. A lifeless synthetic voice emanated from the machine, saying, ""You lose. Try again."" I had never gambled before. All throughout my childhood, my father told me it was a ""sucker's game"" and that I should stay away from it. I had always taken his word for it, but something about this machine was drawing me in.

Focus! My brain screamed, snapping me out of the game's trance. I stuffed the coins in my hand back in my pocket and glanced at the pale, ghoulish old woman beside me. A cigarette smoldering in one hand while the other gripped the slot machine lever with a death-like clutch. Her stony expression and deep-set wrinkles spoke of countless hours wasted. My pulse quickened. I needed to ask her about Chris and Misty, but words felt lodged in my throat. Before I could rein in my nerves, I blurted, ""You look really old, you must have been here for a while."" The words spilled out, raw and clumsy. My face flushed beet red as I reflexively covered my mouth, mortified. I couldn't believe I just said that.

""I...I'm so sorry, I...I didn't mean that. What I meant to say was..."" I trailed off. The woman hadn't moved, hadn't acknowledged my existence, let alone my unintentional insult. She just sat there, staring at the slot machine, mouth agape, eyes glazed over. ""M...Mam?"" I took a step toward her...nothing. I raised my hand and waved it in front of her. Without warning, she jerked the lever in her hand, causing me to jump back reflexively. A yelp escaped my throat as I tripped over my seat into the arms of a passing gambler. I looked up, my embarrassment now cranked up to eleven. ""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..."" It was the same man from earlier, the same chiseled features glaring at me, thinly veiled annoyance plastered onto his face.

""You again? Why can't you just leave me alone?"" He sighed.

""I didn't mean to fall on you. I was trying to talk to the lady sitting next to me."" I answered, trying to excuse myself. He looked me up and down for a moment and then looked at the woman, still solely focused on her gambling.

""Good luck trying to talk to these people. They aren't the chatty type."" He said dismissively. I stood there confused but still determined to get some information on the whereabouts of my friends. He began to leave. I couldn't let him, not until I had information.

""Have any new people come through here the last few days?"" I blurted out. He stopped in his tracks, back turned, then turned around to face me.

""Why?"" He asked, a dubious expression written on his face.

""They're my friends. They were taken by the staff, and I don't want them to get hurt."" I exclaimed, desperation flowing from my words. His eyes narrowed, and he scoffed, turning his back once again. I raced forward to cut him off. ""Please! They could be in danger!"" I implored.

""Not my problem."" He said blankly, not making eye contact as he strode to his seat. He sat his hulking frame down, fishing coins from his pockets and inserting them into the machine.

""Sir,"" I stammered."" I'm begging you. If you have any information, you could help me save two innocent people's lives.""

""Innocent?"" He mockingly laughed. ""There are no innocent people on the bus.""

""These people are!"" I exclaimed in desperation. ""If you had seen the things I'd seen..."" I trailed off, unsure how much information to reveal. ""I think this bus might be evil,"" I whispered, hoping our conversation went unheard. He turned toward me, an incredulous look woven into every millimeter of his face. When suddenly, he burst into laughter.

""You...you think..."" He could hardly catch his breath in between words. ""The bus might...be evil?"" He bellowed out laughs, loud enough to wake the dead.

""Shhh!"" I exclaimed, lowering my head and scanning my surroundings. ""They'll hear you!"" He turned to the passenger nearest to him and clapped them on the shoulder.

""You hear that? ...said the bus might be evil!"" His laughter was dying down to a hearty chuckle while he wiped a tear from his eye. Mortified, I began looking for an exit to make my escape, when the giant man looked back at me, his amusement dying, and said, ""Quit your worrying. None of them can hear you. Most of the people here are too busy playing their stupid games to care."" My shoulders relaxed, feeling much more at ease yet incredibly unnerved by this revelation.

""Most of them? What about the others?""

""I said quit worrying,"" he repeated, his voice edged with finality, though something in his tone faltered, just for a second. I wanted to argue, to press him for more, but the tension in his posture stopped me cold.

""Can you please help me?"" I begged, my voice barely more than a whisper. At that moment, I felt smaller than ever, just another problem he didn't want to deal with.

For a fleeting moment, his expression softened, the hardness in his eyes giving way to something raw and distant. He looked away, jaw tightening as if trying to force down a thought he didn't want to share.

""I can't help you..."" he muttered, almost too low to hear. Then, louder, ""I can't even help myself."" His eyes darted back to me, now blazing with something sharper, harsher. A warning.

""Just fuck off and leave me alone,"" he snapped, his voice a blade cutting through the uneasy quiet around us.

My blood boiled, and my fists clenched instinctively. What was this guy's problem? I'd risked so much coming here, and all he'd done was treat me like a pest. Standing from my seat, eyes blazing, I stepped forward.

""I don't know who you are or what your deal is, but I'm not leaving without answers,"" I said, my voice steady despite the pounding in my chest. ""I'm risking my life to find my friends, and I won't let some bitter asshole like you stand in my way. So, I'll ask you one last time. Have you seen them?""

A tense moment passed, adrenaline coursing through my veins. He could crush me in an instant, and I braced myself for the inevitable. But I didn't move.

The man stood, his towering frame casting a shadow over me. His eyes burned through mine, searching for something. I swallowed hard, my fists clenched, waiting for the first blow that never came.

""You gonna beat it out of me?"" he finally asked, his voice low and measured.

""No,"" I said, my voice cracking.

A flicker of something, confusion? Curiosity? crossed his face. ""You really don't know who I am?""

""Should I?"" I asked, bewildered. His face tugged at the edge of my memory, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't place him.

""That's a relief,"" he said with a sigh, sitting back down and resuming his gameplay. Unsure how to proceed, I cautiously took the seat next to him.

""You do look familiar,"" I ventured, my brain working overtime to place the man. ""Have we met before?""

""Maybe,"" he muttered, his focus still on the slot machine.

""Wait a second..."" I paused, fragments of a memory scratching at the edges of my mind. A football game on TV, my dad yelling at the screen. That jawline, those shoulders... ""You were on my dad's favorite football team, weren't you?""

He stiffened slightly, his shoulders tensing. He didn't answer, but his silence spoke volumes.

""Yeah, you were!"" I said, growing more certain. ""I'm not really into sports, but I remember Dad talking about you. What was your name? Paul, Phil...""

""Preston,"" he interrupted, his voice low. ""Preston Farrow."" He still wouldn't look at me, his eyes fixed firmly on the machine in front of him.

""That's right, Preston Farrow! My dad talked about you all the time!"" I exclaimed. Then I noticed him shift uncomfortably in his seat, his jaw tightening.

""Let me guess,"" he said, his voice dripping with weary sarcasm. ""Preston's a lazy prima donna. He never should have been drafted and set the team back a decade, right?""

I frowned, surprised by his self-deprecation. ""No, he loved you. He loved the whole team.""

Preston scoffed, shaking his head. ""That's new. Most people just tell me I ruined their childhoods or some shit. Wanna swap dads?""

The question caught me off guard. ""He passed, a few years ago,"" I said quietly, my gaze falling to the floor.

Preston froze for a moment, his lips pursed, and his face remained unreadable. ""I wish I were that lucky,"" he muttered under his breath, his voice like a low growl.

I looked up sharply. ""You don't mean that!""

He leaned back in his chair, his smirk cold and distant. ""Oh, I mean it,"" he said, voice steady but cutting. ""That man was a bastard. Nothing I ever did was good enough for him. Win the game? 'You didn't score enough.' Set a record? 'Must've been a weak year.' Drafted first overall? 'Only because they had no better options.'""

His laugh was bitter, hollow. ""I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat. You got to say goodbye. Me? I'll be happy if I get to spit on his grave."" I sat in my seat, too stunned to speak, my jaw nearly hitting the floor. The weight of his words hung heavy in the air, and for a moment, the only sound was the incessant chime of the slot machines.

I swallowed hard and said, ""Is that why...""

""Why I'm such an asshole?"" he interrupted, still staring at the machine. His tone wasn't angry this time, just tired, as if the words themselves weighed too much to carry.

""N...no,"" I stammered, my voice barely audible. ""I was going to ask if that's why you're here to get away from your dad.""

Preston reached for the lever but stopped, his hand hovering over it. His jaw tightened, and for a long moment, he just stared at the machine, the flashing lights reflecting in his eyes.

""Among other things,"" he said finally, as he pulled the lever and fell back into a slump.

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked sympathetically. He perked up from his chair and glared at me.

""Why should I tell you anything?"" His icy blue eyes locked onto mine, sharp and unyielding, like a cornered animal ready to make his escape. The weight of his gaze rooted me in place, my palms clammy and my breath shallow. Time seemed to stretch, the muffled hum of the casino fading into a dull buzz. For a moment, I wondered if I'd pushed too far, poked at something better left buried. But with nothing to lose and everything to gain, I steeled myself and pushed forward just a little bit more.

""Because I don't know you,"" I breathed, my voice barely above a whisper.

He gritted his teeth, the flicker of something unreadable crossing his face. Anger? Pain? I couldn't tell. The space between us crackled like static, and for a moment, I thought he might explode or walk away for good. His eyes darted away, his posture shifting as his shoulders relaxed ever so slightly. A faint, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corners of his lips, though his voice was laced with bitter amusement. ""You got me there."" He crossed his arms, leaned back in his chair, and let out a long sigh. ""So, what do you want to know?""",1,1752463820.0,u_OverInitial8572,0,1.0,False

**Crosses to Bear**

The golden morning sunlight eased its way into my eyesight, coaxing me back to the land of the living. Blinking the sleep from my eyes, a pounding headache greeted me; last night's escapades, clearly taking effect. I looked downward to see Chris still asleep. He groaned softly as he rolled over onto his side. I stood to stretch my legs and find some water, but noticed a blanket draped over the bench seats that I hadn't seen before. I grabbed the blanket and gently placed it on Chris before walking over to the breakfast buffet in the center of the room. I stood in a line that was formed, flanked by two men and a young woman. I reached the front of the line and grabbed a bottle of water, a cup of black, aromatic espresso, and a blueberry muffin. Everything smelled delicious despite my growing nausea.

""Can you hand me a fork?"" The young woman behind me asked. She was thin as a rail and had jet-black hair that caught the sunlight, causing it to shimmer. I handed her the utensil, and she thanked me. ""Rough night?"" she asked.

""You could say that,"" I answered with a forced smirk.

""I saw you and that other guy come in late last night. The spooks force you back here, too?""

""Spooks?"" I asked.

""The staff."" She replied. I remembered last night, the ominous warning the bartender gave Chris and me, echoed in the back of my mind.

""Uh, yeah. Chris had a little too much to drink last night and caused a bit of a scene. I kinda got roped into it."" I answered matter-of-factly.

""Yeah, they don't take too kindly to anything but partying up there."" She said, a forlorn look in her eye. ""I'm Misty Guillard, by the way."" The young woman said, offering her hand to shake.

""Nice to meet you, Misty, I'm...""

""Oh, hey Newbie, you're awake. Save any coffee for me?"" Chris interrupted. ""Oh, hi there, I'm Chris. Pleasure to meet you. Chris shook her hand.

""Good to meet you, too, Chris. Your friend here was just explaining how the two of you ended up back here.""

""Oh, that whole ordeal was a load of shit,"" Chris answered flippantly. ""I got a little inebriated and divulged a bit too much of my past. My eyes started to sweat a little, and that, I guess, is a major no-no up there in party land."" He said, with a wave of his hand.

I looked over at him with a knowing glance. He was downplaying the whole ordeal, either not remembering or purposefully leaving out how much of a gibbering mess he was. ""But hey, don't mind me, I'm gonna go get me some breakfast and mingle a bit."" He said, with a grin, and turned his heels toward the back of the line. Misty and I grabbed our breakfasts and sat together at the nearest unoccupied bench.

""Your friend seems..."" she trailed off

""Helpless?"" I answered.

""I was going to say eccentric."" She said with a giggle. ""Have you known each other long?""

""We met yesterday, and he's already getting me in trouble,"" I stated, a tinge of resentment apparent in my voice. ""I haven't been on this bus for twenty-four hours, and I've already been threatened by security. What about you? When did you get here?""

""Oh, I uh, I don't really know how long I've been here."" She said, looking intently at the floor. ""Could be weeks, maybe months."" She said, under her breath. I got the feeling it wasn't something she wanted to talk about, so I changed the subject.

""So, where are you from?"" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation toward a more mundane topic.

""I was born in Toulouse, France, but moved to Nashville when I was eight. My dad got a job in the States that paid much better than his previous job, so we relocated to Tennessee.""

""That must have been a culture shock,"" I answered, sipping my coffee.

""Not for me, I was so young, I remember very little of France. I don't even have much of an accent."" She said, staring out the window.

""It still must have been hard. Did you leave behind any family, any friends?"" I asked. Her face turned pale, as if all of the blood in her body turned to ice, all at once.

""No...no friends."" She muttered. Again, despite myself, it seems I struck a nerve.

""I hope I didn't poke into a sore subject,"" I said apologetically. I was met only with silence. It dragged on for what felt like an eternity. I was about to say something else when Misty said,

""I don't deserve friends."" She grabbed her dirty dishes and walked away. I sat there stumped. Was it something I said? What did she mean by not deserving friends?

As I sat there, in contemplation, the pianist in the background played a jazzy tune. Everything was rather peaceful until Chris walked up to me with two lit cigars.

""Oh, great,"" I thought to myself.

""Hey, Newbie. I brought an apology gift. The staff were handing these out, so I grabbed one for each of us. I guess it's my way of saying sorry for how last night...you know. He said, trailing off.

I wasn't really up for smoking. I'm not much of a fan of cigars, but with the apologetic eyes Chris was giving me, I couldn't say no.

""Thanks,"" I said, apprehensively reaching for the stogie. He plopped down next to me and inhaled deeply.

""This sure is the life. Not a care in the world, just two friends relaxing, smoking some of the finest Cuba has to offer."" He said, a wide grin forming from ear to ear.

While he prattled on and on about the finer things in life, I was scanning the room, my eyes searched for Misty through the crowd. I finally spotted her, sitting alone in a corner, her face buried in her hands, seemingly crying.

"".....and that's why I only eat grass-fed beef, am I right, Newbie?"" I stood, ignoring Chris's inane babble, and cut through the crowd where Misty was sitting. I gently placed my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her. She jerked away, in a startle, and looked up at me, her eyes red and puffy from tears.

""I'm sorry if I upset you. That wasn't my intention. But if you want to talk, I'm a good listener."" I said softly.

""Why do you care?"" She asked incredulously. ""Everyone on this bus is here for one reason or another, and I'm no different. I'm sure you have your reasons, and you don't see me bothering you about it!"" She was clearly very upset, and her tone mirrored the tumult of emotions she was facing. She sniffled and wiped tears from her cheeks before speaking again. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. You're only trying to help. I guess I'm just going through a lot lately.""

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, taking my seat next to her. She sat in silence for a moment, gathering her thoughts.

""I guess I'll start from the beginning. When I first moved to the US, I was an outcast. I didn't have any friends or anyone, for that matter, to speak to. I barely spoke the language, so meeting new people was out of the question, and my parents were never home because of their busy schedules.""

""I would go to school, struggle to understand what was taught to me, go home, do homework, eat a frozen dinner, and go to sleep. Day after day, month after month, year after year, it was the same routine. Because I spoke so rarely, some of the more rude kids thought I had some kind of learning disorder and were rather mean to me. I was bullied relentlessly. Kids and teachers alike would talk behind my back, and when they did speak to me, it was with an air of condescension.""

""One day at lunch, when I was around twelve, a particularly abrasive student grabbed my cell phone out of my backpack. He waved it around, putting on a mocking French accent, saying, 'Mother, why did you pack snails in my lunch box? I wanted frog legs!' All I could do was cry. But that only egged him on.""

""Each of his friends was laughing at me. All but one, Joseph McCollum."" She sighed deeply after saying his name, as if even mentioning him weighed on her shoulders. ""He stood up from his seat and grabbed my phone from his friend, told him to stop being an ass, and gave it back to me. In an outburst of emotion, I hugged him. Coming to my senses, I was so embarrassed that I ran off. But it stuck with me. Because of him sticking up for me, a social pariah, his friends ostracized him.""

""A few days later, I was sitting alone at lunch, and he came up to me. He asked to sit next to me, and I, being too stunned to speak, nodded vigorously. From that day on, we were inseparable.""

""We had a lot in common, such as hiking and biking. Every weekend, we would bike down nature trails and hike up hills and small mountains.""

""Even our family dynamics were similar. My parents were always gone because of work, Joseph's were never there to begin with. He told me his mom would get high and sleep all day, and his father told him he was an 'unlovable drain' before he walked out on the family. I felt bad for him, but as long as we were in this boat together, we would never be alone again.""

""Once high school came around, we tested our relationship to see if we were more than friends. It didn't work out, though."" She said with a thoughtful smile.

""We were just too close to risk what we already had. We still spent nearly every day together. We would take turns walking each other home from the bus stop, helping one another with assignments, and goofing off together when we had the time. Every day with him felt like a privilege. Due to his influence, I slowly started coming out of my shell. I was more confident when speaking to people and being in social settings in general. With my newfound confidence, Joseph and I applied to the local university. I'll never forget the day Joseph and I received our acceptance letters. We were so excited, we played music as loud as we could and danced through my house all day. We even got matching tattoos."" She pointed to a black chain tattoo wrapping around her wrist. A small glint of pride and sadness flashed in her eyes.

""We made all sorts of plans, such as: what courses we would take, what our majors would be, and what extracurriculars we would pursue. We even found a small apartment to share within walking distance of the school. We settled in nicely but once school started, we began to see less and less of each other. It started slowly,"" She said, melancholy dripping from her voice.

""At first, we hung out every weekend. Then, every other weekend. By the time Christmas break started, I had seen him once in the last three months. The worst part is that I had convinced myself I didn't miss him. I had made new friends this year, and they were taking up my time. I was sure he had too.""

""A girl in my physics class, Rebecca, invited me to a Christmas party her sorority was throwing. It sounded like a ton of fun and just the release I needed from the stress of school. I ran home to get changed, and I saw Joseph. He was so excited to see me. He ran to me, saying,

'Misty! I've got a surprise for you! I've rented out this beautiful B&B in the forest for the break. There are these breathtaking lakes and hiking trails that take you to the foot of the Smokies. Pack a couple of bags, we can leave in the morning!'""

""His eyes were wide with excitement, but I hadn’t expected him to make such a big plan without telling me first. Suddenly, I felt cornered. I hadn’t really thought about it until he asked, but my priorities had changed. A year ago, I would have jumped at the idea, but now… I had new friends and a new life. Part of me was afraid to go back to the way things used to be, afraid that it would pull me back into that old version of myself.""

""'You did all that without asking me? 'I've already made plans.'""

""I could see the joy drain from his face, replaced by hurt and disbelief. He looked at me like I’d just slapped him.

""'You...you made plans? With who?'""

""'Rebecca, from my physics class,' I answered casually, but guilt gnawed at me and I avoided his eyes.""

""'Rebecca, you just met her last week, and you didn’t think to ask if maybe I wanted to do something? You just… replaced me.' His voice was quieter, but the bitterness was starting to creep in.""

""'She invited me, Joseph. You can't just expect me to drop everything because you made plans without asking.'""

""His face twisted, something darker stirring beneath the surface. 'Drop everything? That's rich coming from you. Lately, you've barely acknowledged I exist. Ever since you made all of these new friends, I’ve been an afterthought. Maybe you’re too good for me now, huh?'""

""I rolled my eyes, feeling my frustration mounting. 'This isn’t about you! I’ve just been busy. We both have.'""

""'Busy?' He nearly spat the word out. 'Busy ditching me at every turn! It’s like the second you found a group that wasn’t bullying you, you decided I was expendable!'""

""His words stung, and I snapped back, 'I’m not your emotional crutch, Joseph. You can’t just expect me to be there for you every second like I owe you something.'""

""'So that’s what I am now, huh? Some albatross around your neck, some burden? That’s great, Misty. All these years, that's what you reduce me to.' His voice was rising, and his face was flushed with anger.""

""'You know what, maybe you are!' I shouted, the words spilling out before I could stop them. 'God, it’s like every time I’m with you, you drain the life out of me with your endless need for validation. You don’t need me, Joseph, you just don’t want to be alone, and I’m tired of feeling guilty for living my life!'""

""His face turned pale. His lips trembled, and when he spoke, his voice was deadly quiet. 'At least I needed you, Misty. You don’t need anyone, do you? That’s why you’re so damn heartless.'""

""'Oh, heartless?' I shot back, sarcasm dripping from every word. 'Is that what you tell yourself? Maybe you’re just so unlovable that you cling to whoever shows you the slightest bit of affection because deep down, you know they’ll all leave you just like your dad did! That’s why you’re so obsessed with me, I’m the only one who’s ever cared enough to stick around.'""

""His eyes widened in shock. I could see the impact of my words hit him like a freight train. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. I had crossed a line, and we both knew it.""

""'I…' he started to say, but the hurt in his eyes quickly turned to rage. 'Well, guess what? You didn’t stick around, either. You're just like everyone else who walks out of my life. Turns out you’re even worse because I thought you were different. But no, you’re just a cold, backstabbing bitch.'""

""My heart was racing, my vision blurring with anger, but I felt like I had to win this fight, even if it meant going too far. 'And you know what? Maybe I was just being nice to you all these years because I felt sorry for you. Everyone else saw it, you’re pathetic, Joseph. You’re just too scared to admit it.'""

""There was a tense, deafening silence between us. His shoulders slumped, his face pale as if all the life had drained out of him. When he looked at me, his eyes were hollow, like I’d ripped the last piece of hope from him.""

""He walked away from me, into his room. I stood there for a moment, collecting my thoughts before I, with a huff, stormed out of the apartment.""

""I went to the party, but my mind was elsewhere the entire time. I knew I handled Joseph and I's argument poorly. I needed to apologize.""

""I went back to the apartment to try and smooth things over, but when I opened the door, I found him there, hanging from the curtain rod,"" Misty said, tears freely flowing from her eyes. ""A note protruded from his pocket with only three words written. 'You were right.'""

Misty was openly sobbing, her words only coming out in short, raspy breaths. She looked at me, her heart seemingly torn from her chest. ""The last thing I told him was he was pathetic."" She wheezed. ""I caused this, it's all my fault he died!""

I sat there in stunned silence, not sure what to think or say. My initial reaction was to reach out and hug her. She clung to me like a drowning man does a lifeboat, searching my eyes for hope, for a lifeline.

""It's not your fault. He, obviously, had some demons in his life that he was fighting. You didn't kill him. He did."" My mind was racing as I said the words. In the back of my mind, I did feel as if she had a part to play in the tragedy, but I couldn't vocalize these thoughts. The last thing she needed was a complete stranger to add to her already mounting guilt. As I held her, time stood still. I knew my attempts at consoling the poor woman were futile. She needed time to process, to grieve. After what felt like hours, she broke the hug and stood from her seat.

""You're just saying that to make me feel better,"" She said, sniffling. ""I'm not some stupid child, I don't need you to talk down to me! I'm no better than a murderer!"" A deep, void-like silence permeated the otherwise quiet room.

I struggled to find the words to say, but when nothing came, she said, with a blank, dead-eyed stare, ""I need to use the restroom.""

She walked past me, into the crowd of people that I came to assume all had similar issues they were running from, mistakes they were too afraid to correct. Could I be one of them, I thought, for a fleeting moment, reminding me of the argument my sister and I had before I began this journey?

Of course not, I was in control. I decided to come here to process my emotions and regroup; these people came here as an excuse to run away. My focus now should be to do everything in my power not to fall for the same traps they did.

I made my way back to my seat, deep in thought. Had I said enough? What was the point of saying anything at all? I slumped into the back of my seat with an exhausted sigh. Whether I wanted to be caught up in people's drama or not seemed irrelevant. Maybe that is why I was here, I pondered. Maybe helping others was my purpose. If that's true, however, I don't know if I'm equipped to do that.

As my thoughts raced, I was greeted by Chris, coming to sit with me with a hearty lunch of chili and cornbread, steaming in his bowl.

""You look pretty rough, Newbie. You sleep ok?"" He asked, mouth full.

""I don't know,"" I said dismissively. Part of me wanted to brush him off, but another part needed some form of validation. ""What do you do when there's nothing you can do?"" I asked, turning my eyes to Chris.

""There's always something you can do, Newbie,"" Chris said, shoveling more chili into his mouth. ""Nothing is ever completely out of your control; you just have to decide what steps are available to you."" I pondered what he said for a moment.

""But what if someone doesn't want you to do anything? What if you made things worse? I'm worried for he..."" I trailed off, not wanting to say more than I should.

""Then change your approach. Find out what you did wrong and do something different."" I mulled over what he said, as he chewed loudly, blissfully unaware of the torment Misty and I, by extension, were under. What the man lacked in decorum, I thought, he made up for it in wisdom.

""Thanks, Chris,"" I said, shutting my eyelids in hopes of a small nap.

""Any time, that's what friends are for.""

**Chapter 8**

**Gone**

A low hum of murmurs pulled me from sleep, voices growing louder until they boiled into an argument. Blinking groggily, I sat up, the dim light outside signaling the sun’s retreat beyond the horizon. My head throbbed, a dull ache from last night’s chaotic emotions and restless dreams.

""Chris,"" I whispered, nudging his shoulder. He stirred, groaning softly, but didn’t wake. His snores continued, heavy and unbothered, while the noise in the room grew.

Reluctantly, I stood, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. As I stretched, I noticed a small gathering of passengers near the back of the bus, their faces etched with concern. Something wasn’t right.

“Excuse me,” I said to a man as I approached the edge of the crowd. “What’s going on?”

The man, his face lined with years of wear, turned to me. “It’s the girl. The one with the black hair.”

“Misty?” My stomach twisted.

“Yeah, her,” he said. “She’s gone to the back.”

My heart dropped. “The staff took her?”

He shook his head, glancing nervously toward the others. “No. She went on her own.”

“What?” The word escaped before I could stop it, my voice cracking with disbelief. “She just… walked back there?”

“That’s what’s got everyone riled up,” he muttered, his hands wringing his hat. “I’ve been on this bus for a long time. Seen folks get sent to the back more times than I can count, but I ain’t never seen nobody choose to go.”

The world around me spun. My mind raced with questions, with dread. Why would Misty go willingly? She had been upset earlier, sure, but…

“Did she say anything?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the lump forming in my throat.

He hesitated, guilt flashing in his eyes. “She sat next to me for a bit before she left. Looked like she wanted to talk, but… I didn’t say nothing. Just kept reading my book.”

“You ignored her?” The words came out harsher than I intended.

“I didn’t know!” he snapped back, his voice trembling. “I didn’t know what she was planning to do. I thought she just needed some space.”

I wanted to yell, to berate him for his cowardice, but the truth was like a stone in my gut; I wasn’t any better. I hadn’t checked on her after our conversation that morning. I’d left her to deal with her pain alone, and now…

A ding-dong chime echoed through the room, silencing the murmurs.

“Attention passengers of Section Two,” came the driver’s disembodied voice, calm yet chilling. “It seems some of you are struggling to follow the rules of this journey. Let me remind you: disruptions will not be tolerated. For those who continue to test boundaries, my staff is fully equipped to handle such matters. For everyone else, relax and enjoy your escape. This is your final warning. Thank you and have a nice day.”

The tension in the room was suffocating. Slowly, the crowd began to disperse, passengers returning to their seats with hushed whispers and anxious glances.

The old man turned to me, his shoulders slumped under an invisible weight. “I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he said softly before shuffling back to his seat, head hung low.

I stood there, frozen. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at the door to the back of the bus. The driver’s warning replayed in my mind, his words heavy with menace.

This isn’t your fight, a voice in my head insisted. She made her choice. You don’t owe her anything.

But another voice, quieter yet more insistent, whispered a different truth: What if it were Mom? What if someone could have saved her and didn’t?

The thought hit me like a punch to the chest. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as the weight of guilt pressed down on me. I clenched my fists, struggling to breathe through the storm of emotions raging inside me.

I glanced back at Chris, who was now awake and watching me. His face was unreadable, his gaze shadowed with something I couldn’t quite place. When our eyes met, he quickly looked away, pulling his blanket tighter around him.

Desperation clawed at my throat. I couldn’t just sit here, couldn’t do nothing. But what could I do? If I went after her, I risked drawing the ire of the driver and the staff. If I stayed, I’d carry the weight of this choice forever.

My chest tightened, the air around me feeling thinner with each passing second. My thoughts spiraled, each one louder and more chaotic than the last. I felt trapped, cornered by my own fears and failures.

But beneath it all, that quiet voice still lingered: What if it were Mom?

**Chapter 9**

**Something Different**

I found my way to a secluded bench seat, my brows furrowed, bloodshot eyes, unblinking. I stared at the door to the back section, watching for any inconsistencies in the staff's movements and the passengers' routines. My temples thumped like a war drum, adrenaline coursing through every fiber of my being.

Every movement was noted in the back of my mind. The elderly passenger nearest to the door was engrossed in the book he told me about, and rarely looked up. The pianist unceasingly played his jazzy tunes, lulling anyone near them to sleep. The door, I noticed, remained starkly unguarded but was damn near impossible to get close to without being seen.

I scanned across the width of the room, noticing Chris chatting with other passengers. It seemed to me that Misty's disappearance had no effect on him, and I rolled my eyes with disgust. ""How could he care so little about someone's life being in danger?"" I thought to myself.

I quickly banished the thought. Chris's uncaring attitude only served to distract me. I refocused and looked at my watch. It was getting close to dinner time. My stomach rumbled furiously. The last thing I had eaten was breakfast this morning, but I couldn't allow it to hinder me.

The staff began rolling out carts of food toward the buffet. The small closet-like door they came from was tucked, almost imperceptibly, into a dark corner of the lounge. My mind reeled at the possibilities. If this were a staff access corridor, it must be connected to nearly every room on the bus. If I could find a way to sneak in, I would be able to move freely throughout the entirety of the vehicle.

""That's a big 'if',"" I muttered under my breath. Staying undetected in a staff-only passageway was all but impossible. I groaned and slouched back in my seat, rubbing my eyes. My stomach rumbled again, refusing to be ignored. I came to realize that being hungry was becoming more of a distraction than taking a few minutes to eat. I stood from my secluded perch and made my way to the buffet, where I bumped into Chris.

""Oh, hey Newbie,"" Chris said, with his signature oblivious smile. ""You ok? You seem a bit out of it.""

""No, Chris, I'm not ok. I just....I got a lot on my mind."" I answered with a sigh.

""I understand if you're all tore up about the whole Maddie thing..."" He started.

""Misty!"" I exclaimed, then lowered my voice. ""Her name was...is Misty, and if I can't help her, who will?""

""Alright, fine, I get it. You're upset about Misty. But being upset isn't going to solve the problem."" He said with a sly wink.

""And doing nothing will?"" My blood was boiling; I knew exactly what to expect from Chris's emotional intelligence, but by some miracle, he still found a way to let me down. ""I finally have a chance to do something meaningful in my life, and you're telling me to just bury my head in the sand? No! I'm not going to sit idly by. I'm not going to run away like you did with Cindy!"" The words tasted like vinegar as they left my mouth. As soon as I said them, I wished I could take them back.

""I'm sorry, Chris. That was low, and I shouldn't have said that. I'm scared. For Misty...for us.""

Chris looked up at me, his eyes filled with empathy. ""It's ok, Newbie, I get it. Eat some food, get some rest,” Chris said, his voice quieter now, almost distant. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe someone needs to do something. Just… don’t burn yourself out, okay?”

He took his food and, without another word, turned and left. With my appetite well and truly gone, I grabbed a double shot of espresso for what I knew would be a long night.

Before heading back to my seclusion, I grabbed my phone from my backpack and opened the notes app. 09:00 pm, the staff cleaned up what was left of dinner. 09:15 The staff took drink orders and handed out cigars. 09:45 The old man, reading, got up to use the restroom. 09:50 The old man returned. On, and on my notes went, meticulously, typing out every movement made.

The next time I glanced at my watch, it was well past midnight. Silence washed over the cabin like a heavy blanket. All were sleeping, all but Chris.

He furiously jotted down on a notepad, his eyes darting from time to time to the door and to me. Once he finished writing, he quickly stuffed the note in my backpack. He took a deep breath and, in a flash, made a beeline toward the door. I was too stunned to react, my mouth dropped open as the whole world seemed to slow to a crawl. Chris reached his destination and fumbled awkwardly at the handle. To his and my utter horror, it didn't budge. Immediately, staff from all over the room swarmed his position. Chris screamed loudly as he rushed the staff, shouting profanities and throwing wild punches. None of them connected as the staff member expertly dodged his blows like a well-trained boxer, bobbing and weaving each sloppy swipe.

They wrestled Chris to the ground in an instant, never attacking him, only deflecting his wild punches and swiftly restraining him. I stood from my seat, every fiber of my being screaming to help him. But I hesitated. If I tried to intervene now, I'd share whatever fate the staff had in mind for him.

His eyes, wild with fear just moments before, were now steeled with defiant determination. The staff lifted him effortlessly, as though they’d done this a hundred times.

“Let me go!” Chris roared, thrashing in their grip. “Fight me like a man, you bastards! I won’t go down without a fight!”

I could only stand there, paralyzed. The other passengers stirred, whispering loudly among themselves.

“There is nothing to see here,” one of the staff members said, gripping Chris by the arm. “Go back to sleep. We will deal with this interruption.”

The door slid open, and they ushered Chris through. He glanced over his shoulder at me, flashing a wry grin and a wink, like this was all part of some grand plan only he understood.

“What just happened?” a woman nearby whispered, her voice shaky with confusion. I hesitated, still reeling from the chaos.

“I... I don’t know,” I muttered, brushing past her. I needed space, needed answers.

I hurried to my backpack, where I’d seen Chris stash the note earlier. After a quick search, I found it, crumpled into a ball. Unfolding it with trembling hands, I read the hastily scrawled words:

Hey Newbie, if you're reading this, my plan worked! I got sent to the back! Or they killed me, and it didn’t work. Either way, what you said stuck with me. I’ve lived my life scared for far too long. I had to do something, or I’d never forgive myself. Once I find Misty, I want off this bus. I think I got what I came for anyway. Thanks for being there for me, Newbie. No matter what happens, I’m glad I met you.

My heart skipped a beat. Had he done this... for me?

Ding Dong.

The PA system crackled to life, the bus driver’s voice slicing through the heavy silence. “Twenty-four hours. You idiots couldn’t behave for twenty-four hours. I asked one simple thing from you all, and this is how you respond?”

His cold, calculated delivery sent chills down my spine.

“It seems I have to make an example out of the fool who caused this. I will not tolerate insubordination on my bus. I decide what happens here. Me. If any of you think you know better, try this stunt again. I dare you.”

The intercom cut off abruptly, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

One by one, the other passengers retreated to their seats. The weight of the driver's threat pressed down on us all, and soon the cabin was eerily quiet, everyone too afraid to speak. I crumpled down in my seat, the weight of all that had happened finally catching up to me. All I wanted to do was curl up into a ball and disappear. But that was off the table. I had to help my friends, and time was running out.",1,1752463789.0,u_OverInitial8572,0,1.0,False

Prologue

I’m a nobody, or at least, I aspire to be. I have few friends, fewer commitments, and no complications. People are too messy. I have enough clutter in my head without adding someone else’s to it. Staying to myself is where I find comfort. It’s familiar.

And yet, I feel drawn to people. Take my family, for instance. They’re good, simple folks. We’ve had our ups and downs like any family, but we always find a way to gather once a month. Today at lunch, my sister lit up talking about her first date with her new boyfriend. My mom, ever persistent, tried to nudge me toward going back to school. And Dad leaned back in his chair with a cold beer, yelling at the referees on TV as if they could hear him.

Being the one who listens to their stories, who quietly soaks in their lives, makes me feel useful. Loved. Needed. Maybe it’s because their lives seem clearer, less cluttered than mine. Or maybe I just like hearing how they find meaning in the mess.

Our little dynamic might seem grating to some, and sometimes it is. But more than that, it’s enough for me. At least, I tell myself it’s enough. Most of the time.

""Damn it, ref, if that ain't a facemask, I don't know what is!"" Dad yells from across the room, his voice echoing over the blaring TV.

""They can't hear you, Sam,"" Mom calls from the kitchen, her tone both amused and weary.

I settle into the living room, a glass of lemonade sweating in my hands. The summer heat creeps through the walls like an uninvited guest, wrapping around me like a sticky blanket.

""Dad, can we turn on the air conditioning?"" my sister asks, her eyes glued to her phone.

""Can you pay my electric bill?"" he fires back without missing a beat, his face an unamused wall of stoicism.

My sister shoots me a look, silently recruiting me for backup. I glance away, pretending to focus on the condensation pooling on my glass. She huffs and rolls her eyes. I get it, though. It’s stifling in here. But Dad’s always been like this. Stingy when I was a kid, and even stingier now.

We grew up poor. Dad worked as a contractor, grinding out long days under the sun. He’d leave before sunrise and come home well after it set. Evenings were a blur of him shuffling through the door, shoulders slumped, the weight of the day etched into his face. He’d toss his keys on the end table, eat in silence, shower, and collapse into bed. He wasn’t absent, not exactly, but sometimes it felt like he was more a shadow than a presence.

""I gotta hit the head. Let me know if I miss anything interesting, would’ja, kiddo?"" Dad grunts, pushing himself out of his recliner.

As he stands, I catch a glimpse of his frailty, the way his hands tremble, how his movements seem slower, more deliberate. He looks smaller now, his once-imposing frame eroded by time and sacrifice.

That man sold his youth for his family. I respect the hell out of him for it. But watching him now, hunched and tired, I can’t shake the sadness that creeps in alongside the admiration.

""Sure, Dad,"" I say meekly. As he hobbles down the hallway, I can only hope that in his retirement, he can make up for lost time.

""Kids! Can I get a hand in here?"" My mother's plea breaks me from my morose trance.

I step into the kitchen just in time to see her muttering under her breath at a jar refusing to open. Strands of her chestnut-brown hair escape her messy bun, and she wipes her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a faint flour streak.

""Stupid damn... Oh, great. Mandy, can you grab that jar for me?"" she says without looking up. ""And you, keep an eye on the stove, make sure it doesn’t boil over."" She points at me without breaking stride. ""I’ve got to set the table before lunch burns.""

“Got it, Mom,” I say, stepping toward the bubbling pot. My sister mutters something under her breath but grabs the jar and pops it open with a little too much satisfaction.

Watching Mom dart between tasks, I can’t help but think of how far she’s come, or maybe how much she’s given up. She used to be an executive chef at one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city. That’s where she met Dad, at a retirement dinner for one of his friends.

Hearing Dad tell the story, it was love at first sight. My mother, however, tells it a bit differently. Dad wanted to give his compliments to the chef, but Mom was mistakenly told, she was receiving a complaint. She came out of the kitchen like a bat out of hell and told him off before he could get a word in. It always brings a smile to her lips when she retells the story.

Fast forward a few years, and there they were, married, pregnant with Mandy, and planning their future. Mom decided she wanted to stay home, and Dad, ever the stubborn optimist, declared, “No big deal. My promotion’s just around the corner.” They made sacrifices for each other without hesitation, like it were second nature.

It’s hard to imagine one without the other. They’re the kind of couple that feels unshakable, like they’ve weathered every storm life could throw at them. I don’t know if I believe in soulmates. Sometimes, I wonder if I’m just not built for that kind of connection. But if they exist, Mom and Dad are proof they’re real.

BANG! CRASH! A loud clatter echoed through the house, snapping me out of my thoughts.

“What the hell was that?” Mandy exclaimed, her wide eyes darting toward the hallway.

For a moment, I just stared at her, my heart thudding in my chest, my brain refusing to connect the dots.

“Dad?” Mandy said, panic creeping into her voice. Before I could blink, she was bolting toward the noise.

I followed, my legs stiff and unsteady, as if they belonged to someone else. Mandy reached the bathroom door first, pounding on it with both fists. ""Dad! Are you okay? Dad, answer me!""

She turned to me, her face pale, her hands trembling. “Do something!” she yelled.

Do something.

The words rang in my ears, but my body wouldn’t respond. My feet felt glued to the floor, and my breath came in shallow, useless bursts. “Help me!”

I managed to nod, stepping forward in a daze. Together, we forced the flimsy door open, and the sight inside hit me like a punch to the gut.

Dad lay sprawled on the bathroom floor, his skin pale and clammy, his chest terrifyingly still.

My sister looked up at me, tears filling her vision. ""Call 911!"" she yelled, her voice echoing through the hall. Her voice registered in my mind as a command, a command I understood, but I couldn't comply despite myself. I stood there frozen with overwhelming fear, unable to act.

“Mom!” Mandy screamed, falling to her knees beside him. “Call 911!”

Mom’s frantic footsteps barreled down the hall. She froze in the doorway, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Sammy!"" she gasped.

“He’s not breathing!” Mandy cried.

I stood there, useless, watching as Mom rushed forward, her trembling hands fumbling for her phone. “Stay with him!” she yelled at Mandy, her voice cracking as she dialed.

I wanted to move, to kneel beside him, to do anything but all I could do was watch. My hands hung limply at my sides, my mind racing in a thousand directions but unable to land on a single thought.

The paramedics arrived what felt like hours later, their calm professionalism a stark contrast to the chaos in the room. They moved with practiced efficiency, beginning CPR as Mom shouted details about Dad’s health. Mandy stood by, clutching his hand, her tear-streaked face a mask of desperation.

And me? I stood in the doorway, silent and still, my back pressed against the frame as if it were the only thing holding me upright.

“Do you want to ride with us to the hospital?” one of the EMTs asked.

Mom nodded, climbing into the ambulance without hesitation. She turned to Mandy and me. ""Lock up the house and meet us there,"" she said firmly before the doors slammed shut.

Inside, Mandy took charge, moving with a frantic determination as she turned off the stove and gathered the keys. Meanwhile, I drifted into the living room, my limbs heavy and my head buzzing with static.

The television was still blaring in the background, commercials for cars, pills, public transportation; all of it blending into an unbearable noise. I searched for the remote, my hands shaking, but I couldn’t find it.

“Turn it off!” Mandy shouted from the kitchen.

I yanked the power cord from the wall, the sudden silence hitting me like a wave, leaving me alone with only the sound of my own shallow breathing.

**Chapter 1**

**Change and Stagnation**

Rolling thunder jolted me awake. I glanced at the clock: 4:30 A.M. Groaning, I turned over, staring at the peeling wallpaper and the stained carpet of my tiny apartment. It wasn’t much, but it was all I could afford. The rent was sky-high for a place in the kind of neighborhood where stabbings made the evening news, and break-ins were just background noise. Still, it was home. For now.

Sleep was impossible this time of year, so I threw off the sheets and shuffled to the kitchen. Grabbing a sponge, I half-heartedly wiped down my favorite mug while the coffee brewed. The smell of cheap beans filled the room, briefly cutting through the stale air.

Sipping my first cup of the day, I opened my laptop and started the routine I dreaded most: job hunting. Every listing was the same. Either I wasn’t qualified, didn’t have the experience, or the position had already been filled. Hours passed, frustration mounting as the search turned desperate.

I ventured into less reputable corners of the internet, scrolling through shady message boards and pop-ups promising easy money. Penis enlargement pills, get-rich-quick schemes, and even some bus-themed vacation ads filled the screen. Nothing but scams.

Defeated, I slammed the laptop shut. The world felt like it was against me. No matter how hard I tried, my best was never good enough. ""Another day wasted,"" I muttered to myself.

A quick glance at my phone made my heart drop. 11:05 A.M. glared back at me through the cracked screen.

""Shit!"" I shouted, scrambling to my feet. ""I’m gonna be late to see Mandy!""

I shot off a quick text to Mandy: “Excited to see you at Jay’s Diner. Might be 10 minutes late!” Then I rushed to get ready, brushing my teeth and tripping over a mountain of takeout boxes littering the floor. After a hurried shower, I grabbed the least bad-smelling clothes I could find from the laundry hamper. Cleaning wasn’t exactly at the top of my to-do list these days, but the rank odor of my apartment was becoming harder to ignore.

Ding.

I glanced at my phone. Her reply: “K.”

My chest tightened. “K?” I muttered to myself. What’s her problem? Her curt response stung more than it should have. Maybe I was reading too much into it, but it felt like another sign that things weren’t getting better between us.

A glance at my phone told me it was already 11:50 A.M. No time to dwell. I locked the door behind me and stepped outside, where the rain from earlier showed no sign of stopping.

As I walked, my thoughts wandered to Mandy. It had been a while since we’d talked...really talked. I knew she was busy, but after everything we’d been through, I thought we’d be closer, not drifting further apart. I’d spent the last few years trying to mend the gap between us, but it felt like every attempt only pushed her further away.

I shook the thought from my head, glancing up at the gray, unrelenting sky. Walking wasn’t an option, and I couldn’t justify wasting what little money I had on a rideshare or a cab.

With a sigh, I resigned myself to the only choice left: I’d have to take the bus. Even that felt like another small defeat; a tangible reminder of how far I’d fallen.

I stepped under the bus stop canopy to escape the relentless rain. Drops pounded the metal awning, the deafening noise like a stampede of horses in the distance. The air reeked of alcohol and piss, and the dilapidated bench didn’t look worth the risk of sitting on.

If I remember correctly, the bus should arrive in about five minutes. Just five minutes. I could survive this. Out here, you had to stay on guard. The locals were always either looking to steal something or chasing their next fix. I glanced to my left, then my right, making sure I was alone.

Graffiti covered the canopy walls, showcasing the local flair for romance and wit:

""For a good time, call Hannah G. at 555-0220.""

""I banged your mom.""

""For relationship advice, visit Dr. Suggon Deeznuts P.H.D.""

“Classy,” I muttered.

But underneath the poetic musings of the local wildlife, something else caught my eye. It was an old, weathered ad that looked eerily familiar, the same one I’d seen online earlier.

“Let Go,” the tagline boldly proclaimed.

It sounded like exactly the kind of escape I needed, but the ad screamed scam, like a dollar store vacation package. Still, seeing it here, of all places, unnerved me. Déjà vu hit me like a sucker punch.

Beneath the tagline was a faded phone number, the digits barely legible after years of rain and neglect. Yet something about it drew me in, like a siren call I couldn’t ignore. My stomach churned, and a strange sense of being watched crawled up my spine.

Hiss!

The sound of the bus brakes tore me from my trance. I let out a nervous chuckle, clutching my chest. “Get a grip,” I muttered under my breath as the bus doors creaked open.

""You scared the crap out of me,"" I said to the bus driver with an uneasy smile.

""Bus pass,"" he replied, his tone flat and mechanical.

""Oh, yeah, sure."" I fumbled in my pocket for the pass, my fingers brushing against something unfamiliar. My brow furrowed as I pulled it out, a small, rectangular business card.

“Let Go."" The bright red lettering read.

My face went pale. How the hell did this get in my pocket? Had someone slipped it there? But when? My mind scrambled for a memory that didn’t exist, the question gnawing at me like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

""Bus pass,"" the driver repeated, more sternly this time.

I jumped, shoving the card back into my pocket and handing him my pass with a shaky hand. He scanned it without breaking his blank stare, then returned it wordlessly.

I hurried to a seat by the window, trying to shake the growing unease. Rain streaked the glass as the bus lurched forward, the sound of the wipers scraping rhythmically against the storm.

Looking around, I realized I was the only passenger. It was a small relief. There were no pickpockets, no muggers, no one else to worry about. Yet, the emptiness of the bus felt unnatural, the silence pressing in despite the noise outside.

I turned my gaze to the window, watching the town pass by in a blur of gray and rain. My thoughts drifted to Mandy. Her curt reply earlier still lingered in my mind, stinging more than I cared to admit.

She knew what today meant to me; what it should mean to both of us. It was supposed to be the highlight of the year, a way to remember the better times. I just hoped she wouldn’t make it about herself.

I loved her dearly, but Mandy had a way of twisting the world to revolve around her. If the spotlight wasn’t on her, she’d find a way to step into it. Mom encouraged it. Dad ignored it. I endured it.

The hiss of the bus brakes pulled me from my thoughts as we neared the diner. Mandy was waiting, and whatever today would bring, I wasn’t sure I was ready.

I thanked the driver and exited onto the cold, rainy sidewalk. The storm seemed to let up slightly, making it possible to walk the remaining half block to the diner.

The familiar sound of a bell ringing and an ""Order up!"" shouted from the kitchen pulled me in like a warm embrace. The 1950s design of the diner, with its checkerboard tiles and colorful jukebox softly humming in the corner, hit me with a wave of nostalgia. I could almost hear Dad telling me to pick a song, his voice a little gruff but always warm. The memory brought a bittersweet smile to my face.

""Table for one?"" A friendly voice cut through my reverie. I turned to see a man with a strong, weathered face. His eyes lit up with recognition. ""Wait a second, you’re Sammy and Dianne’s kid, ain’t ya?""

""Yes, I am,"" I said, shaking his extended hand.

""I knew it! Name’s Jay,"" he said with a grin. ""Been a minute since I’ve seen you here. Is it that time of year already?""

I nodded, my gaze dropping to the floor.

""Aw, hell. I’m real sorry, kid. I heard about your dad a couple years back. Damn shame. He was a helluva guy.""

""Thank you,"" I murmured, my throat tightening as I held back tears.

Jay hesitated, then blurted, ""What did ’em in?""

The question hit like a gut punch. I swallowed the lump in my throat, barely managing to say, ""Heart attack.""

Jay winced, his hand flying to the back of his neck. ""Shit, kid. I shouldn’t have asked that. Sorry. I’m sure it’s been rough on y’all.""

A tense moment passed before Jay shifted gears. ""Your mom and sister joining you today?""

""I...""

""Just me,"" Mandy’s voice rang out as she stepped inside, shaking the rain off her umbrella.

She wore a bright red sundress that stood in stark contrast to the gray skies outside. ""Hi, Jay,"" she said, offering a quick smile.

""Mandy! Look at you, as beautiful as ever."" Jay pulled her into a friendly hug before turning back to us. ""Let me grab y’all some menus and show you to a booth.""

""Hey, Mandy,"" I said with a hopeful smile. ""You look good.""

""Uh, yeah. Thanks,"" she replied, her tone clipped, her eyes darting toward the windows.

As we followed Jay to our seats, the tension between us settled like a thick fog. Mandy seemed distracted, distant. Something was off, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was about me or today.

""Here you go,"" Jay said, handing us menus. ""What can I get y’all to drink?""

""A coffee for me,"" I said, glancing at Mandy.

""I’m good, thanks, Jay. I don’t plan on staying long,"" she said, her voice matter-of-fact.

Jay nodded, his smile dimming slightly. ""Alright then. Just one coffee. Be right back.""

As Jay walked away, I turned my gaze to Mandy. ""You’re not staying long?""

Her eyes flicked to mine, and for a brief moment, I thought I saw guilt flash across her face. But then it was gone, replaced by that same distant look.

""Yeah,"" she said simply. ""I’ve got plans later.""

The words stung more than I wanted to admit. She knew how much today meant to me. To us.

But I bit back my frustration. The last thing I wanted was to start another fight.

""Is something wrong, Mandy?"" I asked, my voice quieter than I intended, almost like I didn’t want to know the answer.

""No... Yes."" She sighed, her fingers tracing patterns on the edge of the table. ""Look, I love spending time with you and all, but I just... I can't do this anymore.""

My stomach knotted. ""I don't understand. You can't do what anymore?""

""This."" She gestured vaguely around the diner, her gaze skimming over the retro decor as if it offended her. ""It just brings back too many bad memories.""

""Bad memories?"" I repeated, a bitter edge creeping into my voice despite myself. ""This isn’t about you.""

Her eyes snapped to mine, sharp and cutting. ""You think you’re the only one who feels anything about this? God, you don’t even realize, do you?""

I clenched my fists under the table, trying to keep my tone even. ""You know, I look forward to this every year. It helps me find closure. I thought it helped you, too.""

""Closure,"" Mandy said, letting out a hollow laugh that didn’t reach her eyes. She stared at her shoes, avoiding me. Her dismissal felt like a slap, and my grip on my patience slipped.

""What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"" I asked, my voice rising slightly despite my efforts.

""Nothing. Forget I said anything."" She said quickly, shifting in her seat, her gaze darting toward the exit. Her whole body screamed I don’t want to be here.

""Then why did you even come at all?"" I snapped, anger bubbling to the surface. ""First, you don’t want to be here, now you don’t even want to talk about it? What, you need to run off to that loser boyfriend of yours?""

As soon as the words left my mouth, I regretted them. The hurt on her face was immediate, but it was quickly replaced by fury.

""No!"" she said, banging her fist on the table, her voice trembling but loud enough to turn heads. ""Be mad at me all you want, but don’t you dare bring him into this.""

The tension was suffocating, but my anger had already taken the reins. ""You’ll defend him, but you won’t even stay for your own father’s memorial? Your own family?"" My voice rose with each word, drawing stares from the other patrons, but I didn’t care.

Her hands were trembling, tears welling in her eyes, but her voice was sharp, biting. ""He's going to be your family too! I was going to tell you, if you weren’t so immature! I wanted to believe you’d be happy for me, but you’re too busy wallowing in your own self-pity to give a shit about anyone else!""

The words hit like a gut punch, but I couldn’t stop myself. ""Well, woopty-fucking-doo! Now you’ve got a new family to turn your back on when they need you,"" I said, my tone venomous.

Her face froze, her wide eyes locking onto mine as if I’d physically struck her. For a moment, the whole diner seemed to hold its breath. Then, her voice cracked, raw, and trembling.

""Fuck you!"" she screamed, standing so abruptly her chair scraped across the floor. ""I’m not the one who stood there doing nothing while Dad died! I’m not the one who left Mom alone when she needed us; when you should’ve been there!""

The blood drained from my face, but she wasn’t finished. Her voice cracked with emotion, her words spilling out in a flood. ""You think this is about me leaving? You’ve been checked out for years! And now Mom’s gone, and it’s all your fault! And I’m not going to let you drag me down with you, not again.""

Her voice broke entirely as she clutched her purse, tears streaming down her face. ""I can’t watch you keep going down this road. I won’t.""

She stormed out, the bell over the door ringing harshly as she vanished into the downpour. I sat frozen, her words reverberating in my skull.

I’m not the one who stood there doing nothing.

Mom’s gone.

It’s all your fault.

I stared at the empty seat across from me, my throat tight and my chest hollow. Rain streaked down the window, swallowing her figure as she disappeared into the storm. I didn’t go after her. I couldn’t. I just sat there, replaying every word, every moment, every mistake.

**Chapter 2**

**Deafening Silence**

Every neuron in my brain was firing all at once. Pain, grief, anger, embarrassment, loss. It was all too much. The dam in my mind holding back these emotions had finally given way, and the tears poured out in a torrent.

The bell over the door jingled softly as it swung shut behind her, the sound swallowed by the pounding rain outside. The low hum of conversation and clinking plates in the diner felt distant, like a muffled memory.

I buried my face in my hands, my shoulders shaking as I struggled to keep quiet. The words Mandy hurled at me refused to leave: “Mom’s gone, and it’s all your fault.” They stuck like burrs, scratching at my thoughts, refusing to let me breathe.

“Ahem.” Jay’s voice pulled me out of my spiral. He approached the table, his face kind but cautious. “Looks like you could use something stronger than coffee.”

I quickly wiped at the tears streaming down my face, hoping he wouldn’t notice. “Jay, I’m sorry,” I mumbled, my voice trembling. “I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I’ll just pay for the coffee and leave.”

Flustered, I fumbled through my pockets, searching for the few crumpled bills I’d brought with me. My fingers trembled, more from the weight of Mandy’s words than the rain-soaked cold.

“Nah, kid. Don’t sweat it.” Jay waved my attempts away with a fatherly ease. “Looks like you’ve had a long day.” He paused, tilting his head toward the rain streaking down the diner windows. “Tell you what, how about I call you a cab? No one needs to walk home in this weather.”

His genuine smile nearly broke me all over again. I shook my head, embarrassed at the offer. “I can’t ask you to do that,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Well, good thing you didn’t ask,” he said with a gentle laugh. His tone carried a warmth that twisted something deep in my chest, a ghost of how Dad used to sound when he was trying to cheer me up after a bad day.

I opened my mouth to protest again, but all that came out was a shaky breath. Jay clapped me lightly on the shoulder. “Sit tight, kiddo. I’ll get it sorted.”

As he walked away, the storm outside seemed to press closer, the relentless drumming of the rain on the roof filling the hollow silence inside me.

**\*\*\*\***

The cab ride home was a blur. Jay had insisted I let him cover it, and though my pride resisted, I couldn’t muster the energy to argue.

The rain was relentless, streaking down the cab windows in steady sheets. I watched the city pass by, the streetlights casting fleeting halos on the glass, but my mind was stuck in the diner, replaying every word Mandy and I had exchanged. Her voice, raw with anger, cut deeper each time I heard it in my head.

By the time I stepped into my apartment, I was soaked despite the short sprint from the curb. The sound of the rain muffled as the door clicked shut behind me, leaving only the hum of the fridge and the occasional drip from the leaky faucet in the kitchen.

I tossed my keys onto the counter and slumped onto the couch, my wet clothes clinging to me like the weight of the day itself. Mandy’s words churned in my head, sharper now in the silence.

She was wrong to say what she did. I’m not the one who stood there doing nothing... The thought flared up again, defensive and angry, but it fizzled just as quickly.

Because maybe I had done nothing.

I hadn’t moved when Dad collapsed. Mandy had to yell at me to even react. And when Mom... My throat tightened, and I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the memory away. I hadn’t been there for her either.

But Mandy wasn’t innocent. She’d pulled away after Dad died, shutting both of us out. Mom needed both of us, and Mandy... Mandy was too wrapped up in her own life to see it. Or maybe she saw it and just didn’t care. That thought felt cruel, even to me, but I couldn’t let it go.

Maybe if she hadn’t left...

No. I stopped myself. Thinking like that wouldn’t bring either of them back. The blame, the resentment, the guilt, it was all just noise, a toxic loop I couldn’t break out of.

I ran a hand through my damp hair, sighing heavily. This wasn’t how today was supposed to go. I’d wanted to honor Dad, to feel close to him again, but instead, everything felt further away. Like, even the memories were slipping through my fingers.

The only course of action I could think of was to send an olive branch. I stared at my phone, the glow of the screen the only light in the dim apartment.

I hate that things turned out this way.

The words stared back at me, stark and insufficient. I deleted them and started again.

I wish we had talked sooner, so this could have been avoided.

Delete. Rewrite. Delete again. Each version felt wrong, too harsh, too weak, too desperate. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, caught between pride and the fear of losing her completely.

Finally, I settled on: I hate how today ended. I wish we had talked sooner, so this could have been avoided. I know you’re mad at me, but I said what I felt needed to be said. No matter what, we’re still family. I still love you.

I read it over three times, tweaking a word here and softening a phrase there. It wasn’t perfect, but it was honest. Or at least as close to honest as I could manage.

My thumb hovered over the send button for what felt like an eternity. If I sent it, it might bring her back. Or push her further away. But if I didn’t...

I hit send before I could second-guess myself again.

The message hung there, unread, the timestamp mocking me. I set the phone down on the coffee table and leaned back into the couch, exhaustion settling in like a heavy blanket.

Mandy was the only family I had left. That thought gnawed at me, bitter and undeniable. I wanted to believe that tomorrow would be better, that this message would be a step forward. But deep down, I knew better.

I closed my eyes, the sound of rain still pattering against the windows, and let the weight of the day pull me into a restless sleep.

I woke up to sunlight filtering through my threadbare curtains, painting streaks of light on the wall like scars. My body protested as I sat up, a dull ache in my muscles from the restless night. Reaching for my phone, I squinted against the brightness, hoping, expecting, to see a message from Mandy.

There was nothing. No texts, no missed calls, not even a junk email.

I stared at the blank screen, my stomach twisting. She’s probably still asleep, I told myself. Or maybe she feels bad about yesterday and doesn’t know what to say. The rationalizations felt hollow, but I clung to them anyway.

Needing something, anything, to distract myself, I got up and surveyed my disaster of an apartment. The clutter felt suffocating, a mirror of my own jumbled thoughts. I grabbed a garbage bag and started cleaning, trying to scrub away the gnawing anxiety along with the grime.

Every so often, I’d glance at my phone, hope blooming in my chest, only to wither when the screen remained empty. I typed and deleted message after message, running the gamut from seething accusations to desperate apologies, but none of them felt right.

The day dragged on, the sun creeping across the room as I worked. Each task, collecting garbage, disinfecting counters, and folding laundry, was an exercise in futility. No amount of cleaning could quiet my racing mind. Mandy’s face hovered behind my eyelids when I blinked: her clenched jaw, her tear-streaked cheeks, the fire in her eyes when she lashed out.

By the time I finished, the apartment was spotless, and I was spent. My body ached, but the buzzing in my head wouldn’t stop. Anxiety coiled in my chest, tightening with every passing minute. I dragged myself to the shower, hoping the water would wash some of it away.

The lukewarm spray did little to soothe me. As I stepped out, wrapping a towel around my shoulders, a familiar chime echoed from the bedroom. My heart leaped, hope surging as I rushed to grab my phone.

It wasn’t Mandy.

It was an automated text from the apartment management reminding me that my rent was overdue.

“Fuck!” The word burst out of me, raw and unrestrained. My fingers tightened around the phone as frustration boiled over. Enough was enough. I couldn’t keep playing these games, waiting for her to make the first move.

Without giving myself time to second-guess, I opened my contacts and tapped her name. The phone rang once, twice, three times. Each ring felt like a countdown, the tension coiling tighter in my chest as I waited for her to pick up.

""I'm sorry, but the person you've called has a voicemail box that has not been set up yet. Goodbye,"" the robotic voice droned, its cold finality sending a jolt through me.

""Nah, no way. You're going to answer,"" I muttered, my thumb already dialing.

Ring after ring, only to be met with the same indifferent voice. My frustration mounted with each attempt, my breath quickening, my grip on the phone tightening. I redialed again. And again.

Finally, the tone changed, an ear-piercing screech, and then a new voice, equally detached: ""We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please check the number and try your call again.""

I stared at the screen, the words not making sense. Disconnected? No longer in service? My hands turned clammy, the phone slipping slightly in my grasp. She didn’t... she wouldn’t.

Desperate, I turned to my laptop, fumbling to log in to my social media account. My fingers trembled as I searched for her name. Nothing. She wasn’t there. My chest tightened, a hollow ache spreading through me.

""No,"" I whispered, barely audible. My voice cracked, but no one was around to hear it anyway. Anger flickered for a moment, hot and sharp. But it fizzled out as quickly as it came, leaving behind only emptiness.

The walls of my apartment seemed to close in, suffocating and oppressive. My thoughts turned inward, a cruel chorus building in my mind. ""You fuck everything up."" ""No wonder she cut you off."" ""It’s your fault the family fell apart."" ""They’d be better off without you.""

The barbs struck deep, each one pulling me further into the storm. The weight of it all, the fight with Mandy, the years of guilt, the silence from her now, pressed down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I sat on the edge of my bed, staring blankly at the floor, tears blurring my vision until they spilled over. The first sob was quiet, almost surprising, but it quickly gave way to another. And another. Soon, I was crying uncontrollably, the kind of cry that leaves you gasping for air, your chest tight and burning.

The thoughts didn’t stop. They swirled and echoed relentlessly. You’re pathetic. You’re alone. You deserve this.

The sobs racked my body until I was too exhausted to make a sound, my breath coming in shallow, hiccupping gasps. I pressed my palms into my temples as if I could squeeze the thoughts out of my head, but they only grew louder.

I needed something to make it stop.

The idea crept in, unbidden but tempting. The corner store was just a block away. They sold the cheap, high-proof stuff that could drown this feeling for a while. I wasn’t much of a drinker; never had been. But if there was ever a night to change that, it was tonight.

**Chapter 3**

**Revelation**

I didn't have much money, but thanks to not having to pay for a ride home last night, I still had just enough cash in my coat pocket to buy a cheap fifth of vodka.

I walked over to my coat rack and slipped on the still-moist jacket, feeling my pockets for the money. I felt around and found a few quarters and dimes, but knew I had more. I checked the other pocket and felt a wadded-up five-dollar bill and something I didn't recognize. Pulling it out, it was that same haunting business card from the bus stop.

With everything that had happened in the last 24 hours, I had completely forgotten about the advertisements, the pop-up, and even the card. But now with it in my hand, staring up at me, it was all-encompassing. The tagline, ""Let Go,"" blazed into my tear-laden corneas. The pain of my recently deceased family, my mounting debt and bills, my tattered relationship with my sister, it was all too much. I wanted, no, needed to let it all go.

I looked back down at the card, and the words seemed to burn into my mind. I knew better than to trust some shady ad, but something inside me, the part of me that was drowning under the weight of my failures, the desperation, wanted to believe.

What if this were my way out? ""The vodka can wait,"" I said to myself. I opened my laptop back up and searched keywords, like ""Want to get away from it all?"" and the telephone number written on the back. The searches produced less than reputable results, ranging from more pop-up ads to insane babble from message board conspiracy theorists. One thread piqued my interest, however.

From TruthSeeker1163, ""I've been seeing ads for this service for years. I know, from reliable sources, however, that this is part of the New World Order's world domination plan. These buses will be used like the trains were in the holocaust. They will kidnap the world's pregnant women to siphon their milk for their lizard-man overlords. As we all know, lizards can't produce milk, so they need ours to feed their young. I saw a pregnant woman just last weekend, standing at the bus stop on the corner of Barker and Pleasance.""

I rolled my eyes at first and stifled a small laugh, but Barker and Pleasance? That's the stop I used. Could he be talking about the same stop? I quickly opened my maps app and typed in the address. To my amazement, it was the only Barker and Pleasance that had a bus stop in the country. This couldn't be a coincidence.

I flipped the card around in my hand, over and over, pondering what my next move should be. In my mind, I weighed the pros and cons. On one hand, this could be some kind of scam, built to take the last few cents out of desperate people's pockets. On the other hand, if it wasn't, this could be the escape I need. An escape, to recharge and refocus my priorities in a new light. It's not like I have much for them to steal anyway.

The more I thought about it, the more my mind spiraled. It had to be a scam, right? But if it wasn’t... if this was real, then maybe, just maybe, it was my one chance to get out of this nightmare. What did I have to lose? Because of my financial constraints and rent being due, I'd be out on the street in a few days anyway.

With my mind made up, I decided to call the number. As I dialed, my hands trembled. A cold wind seemed to blow through the aether and into my bones. A chill coursed through my veins and ran up my spine, only broken by the dulcet sound of

""Hello.""

The voice was soft and melodic, like a lullaby whispered just before sleep. It sounded familiar, a voice I hadn't heard in a long time. A voice that, for the life of me, I couldn't place. My heart rate slowed, and my muscles relaxed almost against my will. For a moment, I forgot where I was and why I had called.

""Is this the...bus...service...people?"" I stammered, feeling silly even asking the question.

""Yes,"" the voice replied with a slight giggle. ""You’ve been searching, haven’t you? For something... different, something better."" My throat went dry, my mind buzzing. How did they know? ""We know it’s been hard,"" the voice continued, as if reading my thoughts. ""The weight of it all. You’re tired, aren’t you?""

A lump formed in my throat, and I nodded before realizing they couldn’t see me. ""Y-yeah,"" I whispered. ""I’m exhausted.""

""You don’t have to carry it alone anymore,"" the voice promised each word a balm for my raw, aching soul. ""We can take you away from the pain. Away from the worry. Wouldn’t that be nice?""

""Yes,"" I croaked, the tears welling up again. ""Please. I just... I just want to get away.""

""Then let us help you."" The voice didn’t demand, it didn’t push. It was calming and peaceful, the exact opposite of everything I’d been feeling for so long. ""There’s a place for you on the bus. You just have to be ready. Can you be ready?""

""I... I think so,"" I said, feeling the last shreds of doubt dissolve. This was what I needed. This was the answer.

""You’re doing the right thing,"" the voice reassured. ""We’ll come for you soon. When you’re ready, just wait by the stop at Barker and Pleasance.""

I swallowed, the name of the stop sending a jolt of recognition through me. ""I know that place,"" I whispered.

""Of course you do,"" the voice replied, as gentle as ever. ""It’s been waiting for you. We’ve been waiting for you. No more worrying about family or bills. You’ve earned this escape.

""W...wait a second, how do you know about all of that?"" I asked incredulously. The line went dead. I sat there in silence for what seemed like an eternity. I couldn't seriously be considering this. Could I? My mind was muddled, and my stomach began to twist. Everything was happening so fast. \*buzz\* \*buzz\* A message notification alerted me. It was from the bus.

Or let me ask you this: What would you do if a silent red watch on your wrist started ordering you to stand — or else? Would you obey, not knowing what waits if you don’t?

That’s the kind of nightmare I stumbled into when I took the most ordinary-sounding job on paper — toll collector on a lonely stretch of Highway 371, buried deep in the humid underbelly of That City. It was a job as plain as day: sit in a booth, swipe cards, take cash, lift the gate, scribble license plates in a battered notepad. No health insurance. No sick leave. No overtime. Just a bare-bones paycheck hovering a whisper above minimum wage.

Yet, beneath that thin surface, something festered. Something no one warned me about.

Desperation drove me to it. My car had coughed its last breath. Rent was overdue, and my landlord’s patience was running on fumes. A cousin I barely kept in touch with handed me this lifeline: “They’re hiring. No questions asked. No paperwork. Just show up. You can start tonight.”

So I did. And when the man in charge passed me the cold, rusty keys, he muttered something that should have sent me running:

“Don’t worry about the weird stuff. Just follow the alerts.”

I laughed it off, assuming he meant storm warnings or AMBER alerts crackling through a dusty radio. But I couldn’t have been more wrong.

That first night swallowed me whole in its quiet. I arrived at the booth at 10:45 PM, the thick air sticky on my skin. The booth itself was a cramped, rotting box — no bigger than a closet. Inside: a metal chair with cracked vinyl, a desk scarred with cigarette burns, a stubborn cash drawer, a yellowed notepad clinging to its last pages, a wheezing fan that did little to fight the heat... and one item that made my gut twist the moment I saw it.

A watch.

Not the kind you’d buy at Walmart or find in your granddad’s drawer. This was strange — a black band tight around my wrist, its screen pulsing a dim red glow. No clock face. No numbers. No buttons. No apps. Just that blood-colored screen waiting, as if it was alive. I told myself it must be some outdated tracker — for my hours, maybe my heartbeat.

Hours oozed by like molasses. A trickle of cars rolled through. I collected tolls, logged plates, battled mosquitoes the size of quarters. My eyelids grew heavy.

Then — at exactly 1:13 AM — the watch came to life.

One word.

“STAND.”

My throat constricted as I forced myself to clear it. I blinked at the watch, puzzled, heart thumping like a drum. Before I could think, a voice — not from the booth, not from my phone — echoed deep in my skull. Like a broadcast beamed straight into my mind.

“Emergency notice. Rule Four. Between 1:10 and 1:20 AM — do not remain seated.”

Every hair on my arms stood at attention. Without hesitation, I shoved the chair back, its legs shrieking across the floor, and stood. That’s when I saw it.

Outside the booth’s grimy window, a shape crept past. A black, slithering mass that clung to the ground like a shadow came alive. No feet. No face. No sound. Just endless black stretching across the asphalt.

I didn’t breathe. I didn’t move. The thing didn’t look at me — if it even had eyes. Time dragged its feet. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, the watch’s glow blinked out at 1:20. The thing was gone.

That was the first rule I learned. The first night that taught me — this job wasn’t about tolls. It was about surviving whatever shared that highway with me.

So tell me... if you were in that booth, would you follow the watch? Would you obey — even if you didn’t understand? Or would curiosity get the better of you?

Stick around. Because what came next? It wasn’t just rules. It was warnings. And breaking them had a price.

By the end of that first hellish week, I had seven rules scrawled in shaky handwriting across the stained pages of my notepad — a personal bible of survival, stitched together not by logic, but by fear.

None of these rules came from a training manual. No supervisor handed them to me with a wink and a “good luck.” No — they came to me in the dead of night, whispered by that voice that invaded my mind, delivered through that cursed red watch, like some cryptic survival guide written for a world that shouldn’t exist. And as I learned quickly — violating these rules wasn’t just careless. It was suicidal.

Here’s what I lived by:

Rule 1: If the same car passes through twice within ten minutes — no matter the driver, no matter how innocent they look — you charge double. 

Rule 2: If a child is behind the wheel, you wave them through. Don’t take their money. Don’t ask questions. 

Rule 3: If you hear knocking beneath the floorboards, play the booth’s radio — immediately. 

Rule 4: Between 1:10 and 1:20 AM, do not stay seated. Stand up and don’t sit until it’s over. 

Rule 5: Never look at anyone who speaks backward. Keep your eyes down. 

Rule 6: If an old woman pays with exact change, look into her eyes. Make sure they’re human. 

Rule 7: If the watch flashes the word “HIDE,” crawl under the desk and do not, under any circumstances, breathe loud enough to be heard.

At first glance, some of these rules seemed almost laughable. A child driving? Charge double for the same car? But trust me — they weren’t jokes. I didn’t invent them. I didn’t dream them up during a long, lonely shift. These were commands, delivered in that hollow voice that echoed through my skull like the tolling of a funeral bell. And behind every rule, there was a consequence waiting — sharp-toothed and unforgiving — for those foolish enough to ignore it.

And I, like a fool, learned that lesson the hard way.

It was on my twelfth shift — a night that began like all the others, thick with the scent of swamp rot and the unshakable feeling of being watched. The air hung heavy, and the booth felt smaller somehow, like the walls were inching closer, trying to squeeze the life out of me.

Around 3:00 AM, when the world felt more dead than asleep, I heard it. At first, it was a faint tap-tap-tap beneath the floorboards. Like someone drumming their fingers, impatient, waiting for me to slip up. I froze, my ears straining in the dark.

The tapping grew bolder. Louder. A steady knocking that seemed to pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. Rule 3. I knew what it demanded. Turn on the radio. Drown out the sound. But I hesitated.

The watch stayed dark — no word, no alert. And in my arrogance, or perhaps exhaustion, I convinced myself the rule wasn’t active tonight. Maybe it was just the building settling, or rats beneath the floor. I reasoned it away, because the truth was too frightening to face.

That’s when the knocking stopped. For the briefest breath of a second, all was silent.

And then — CRACK.

The floor split. The wood splintered like kindling. From that jagged opening, a hand emerged. A hand that wasn’t right. Its skin was a sickly gray, stretched tight over bones that jutted at the wrong angles. Fingers — six of them — too long, too thin, tipped with nails like slivers of glass. It moved with eerie grace, wrapping around the leg of my chair as if it had all the time in the world.

My blood turned to ice. My throat tightened so violently I thought I’d choke. I opened my mouth, but no sound came — not at first. Then, instinct took over. My shaking fingers smacked the radio dial, and the booth erupted in a wave of static and white noise.

The hand twitched. Its fingers flexed, as if testing the air. And then — like smoke caught in a breeze — it slipped back beneath the floorboards, vanishing into the dark crack that slowly sealed itself shut.

I didn’t sleep the next day. I couldn’t. Because now I knew: these weren’t empty rules. They were shields. And breaking them had woken something that still wasn’t done with me.

Even now — on some nights — that knocking comes back. Faint at first, like a memory I can’t bury. A reminder that it’s waiting. And believe me, every single time, I play the radio.

So what would you do if you sat in that booth, with nothing but a flickering radio and a set of rules that felt more like warnings than guidance? Would you follow them, or would curiosity — or pride — cost you everything?

Stay tuned. Because what I’ve shared? That was only the beginning. And the worst — the rule I couldn’t bring myself to obey — nearly cost me my life.

It was a night like all the others — or so I told myself. But deep down, I sensed it. That heavy, suffocating stillness that wraps around you right before something breaks. And when it broke... It changed everything.

I had grown used to the rhythm of terror. The familiar pulse of that watch lighting up with commands. The quiet dread of waiting for what came next. But this night? This night rewrote the rules — quite literally.

Sometime past 2:00 AM, when the fog rolled in thick as graveyard mist and the highway lay deserted, I felt it. The sudden, unnatural drop in temperature. The way the air seemed to thicken, as if the darkness itself had weight.

That’s when I noticed the car.

No headlights. No engine hum. I never heard it arrive — it was simply there, idling at the gate like it had materialized from thin air. Its paint was the color of rusted iron, the body warped in places, as if it had seen things no car should survive.

Then — the watch blinked red, its glow casting eerie shadows on the booth walls.

“EYES.”

A single word. But before my heart could even quicken, that voice — the one that felt like it scraped across my bones — filled my head.

“Emergency Notice. Rule Six. If an old woman pays with exact change... check her eyes.”

And there she was.

Without sound, without warning, she stood at my window. Her skin looked like crumpled parchment — so thin it seemed the wind might tear it. Her hand, trembling but purposeful, reached out with a wrinkled dollar bill and a small, shaking handful of coins.

“A dollar twenty-five,” she whispered, her voice like dead leaves brushing across pavement. And then she smiled — a slow, hollow curve of the lips that didn’t touch her hollow expression.

I forced myself to look up. My throat tightened so violently I thought I might gag.

Where her eyes should have been... nothing. Not blindness. Not damaged or scarred. Just two dark pits — empty as an open grave, as if something had scooped her soul out through those voids.

Panic clawed at me. My instincts shrieked at me to look away, to close the window, to flee. My fingers fumbled for the button, eager to lift the gate, to be rid of her, to end this nightmare.

“Keep the change,” I stammered, voice cracking, as I reached for the switch.

But she didn’t move.

She didn’t drive through.

Instead, she remained there, frozen, smile still carved into that lifeless face. And then she spoke again — her voice sharper this time, the sound burrowing under my skin like ice water pouring down my spine.

“You’re not checking close enough.”

My skin crawled. My heart pounded so loud I was sure she could hear it. I spun and slapped the radio on, hoping the static would break whatever spell this was. But the radio gave me nothing — only silence, as if the booth itself held its breath.

And when I turned back — she was gone.

The car. The woman. The coins she had held. Every trace of them — vanished like smoke. The only evidence she had ever been there was the cold dread that clung to me like a second skin.

Then, as if the booth had decided to twist the knife, I heard it.

The flip of paper.

I turned slowly, every nerve on edge. My notepad — my tattered, lifeline of rules — lay open on the desk. The page glistened, as if ink had just been spilled across it, fresh and black, bleeding into the paper like it had a mind of its own.

And there it was.

A new rule. One I had never written. One that hadn’t come from the voice — at least, not yet.

Rule Eight: Never let her speak twice.

I was trembling.

Not from the cold—from knowing. From the sick certainty that she wasn’t finished.

What would I do if she came back?

Because deep down, I knew this much:

She will.

Not tonight. Maybe not tomorrow. But one night, she’ll return.

And next time?

She won’t knock. She won’t smile. And she sure as hell won’t wait.

So if you thought that was strange…

You haven’t heard the worst of it.

Because the deeper the night went, the darker the rules got.

And trust me—

They only got harder to follow.

It started like any other night — but by now, I knew better than to trust the quiet. The quiet was a liar. It wrapped itself around the booth like a shroud, hiding what waited beneath. And that night, it hid something I still can’t explain.

It was well past 2:00 AM when the red glow of the watch broke through the darkness, casting its sinister light across my hand.

“DOUBLE.”

The word pulsed, as if alive. And I knew exactly what it meant.

Rule One. Same car twice within ten minutes? You charge double. Simple, right? But nothing out here was ever simple.

At 2:04, I’d seen it — a silver SUV, its body dusty, a small dent carved into the rear bumper like a scar, and a cheap pine tree air freshener swinging from the mirror. I barely gave it a thought as it rolled through.

But at 2:09 — there it was again.

Same vehicle. Same dent. Same swaying air freshener. I felt my stomach twist as I stepped to the window.

“That’s gonna be two-fifty,” I said, my voice steadier than I felt. “You came through already.”

The driver — a man maybe in his thirties, pale as moonlight, sweat dripping from his hairline — didn’t argue. His hands trembled as he fumbled for his wallet. He handed me the cash like someone surrendering, like he knew the rules too, somehow.

But just as I reached for the gate button, thinking this would be the end of it, he leaned forward. His eyes locked on mine, wide and glassy, the eyes of a man who’d seen something that broke him.

“I never turned around,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I just kept driving straight. Never saw a turnoff. Never hit a loop. But I’m back here.”

I froze. My mouth went dry. My mind raced for something — anything — to say. But the words died in my throat.

He swallowed hard, desperation bleeding into his voice.

“Do I keep going? Or will I come back again?”

And then — the watch blinked.

“DON’T.”

Just like that. One word. A command. The gate stayed shut beneath my fingers. I didn’t argue. I didn’t dare.

The man’s face crumpled — fear, confusion, hopelessness. He opened his mouth, maybe to plead, maybe to curse, but before any sound came out, headlights bloomed in the rearview mirror.

Another vehicle.

Another silver SUV.

Identical in every detail. The dent. The dirt. The dangling air freshener swaying in the still night air.

But this one…

This one had no driver.

The empty SUV rolled forward, silent, steady, as if guided by unseen hands. Or maybe something worse. The man in front of me saw it too. His eyes darted to the mirror, his breath quick and shallow.

“What the hell is happening?” he choked out, voice cracking.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The truth was, I didn’t know.

The two vehicles sat there — one with a terrified man trapped behind the wheel, the other hollow and soulless, like a reflection that had stepped out of the glass to take his place.

And I could do nothing but watch.

By the third week, I stopped trying to make sense of any of it. I gave up looking for patterns, for logic, for any thread that might tie this nightmare together. The highway didn’t play by human rules. And I’d learned, the hard way, that trying to outthink it only made it hungrier.

So I obeyed. Every alert, every rule, no matter how strange, no matter how terrifying — I followed them like gospel. But even blind obedience wasn’t always enough.

One night — the air thicker than usual, heavy with a storm that never came — the watch went mad.

The red glow didn’t just blink. It flashed, frantic and blinding, casting the booth in hellish light.

DANGER. DANGER. DANGER.

Over and over, pulsing faster than my heartbeat. No rule. No instruction. Just that single word hammering into my brain.

And then — the broadcast.

“Emergency Override. Hide now. Don’t ask questions.”

That voice — cold, mechanical, empty — didn’t leave room for hesitation. My body moved before my mind could catch up. I dropped to the floor and crawled under the desk, the splinters biting into my palms. I didn’t kill the lights. I didn’t even look at the gate. There wasn’t time.

And then I heard it.

A scraping sound — low, deep, like metal being dragged across asphalt. But not in jerks or bursts. This was smooth. Relentless. Something enormous was moving past the booth, slow and steady, like it knew exactly where I was.

Bigger than a semi. Bigger than anything I’d ever seen on that stretch of road. And yet... it cast no shadow. It made no noise except that endless, skin-crawling scrape.

And then — it spoke.

A voice like rust. Like wind through a graveyard. Like metal tearing itself apart.

“Rulebreaker... where...”

The word stretched, cracked, echoed through the night. My throat clenched so tight it hurt. My lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t dare breathe.

It dragged itself along, slow, sniffing — or maybe listening. Searching.

“Took the coin... kept the stare... no radio...”

The words slithered under the booth’s door like smoke, wrapping around me, choking me. It was naming the rules — the ones that had been broken, by me or by someone before.

And then — the booth lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then died.

The watch’s glow blinked out.

Dead silence. Dead dark.

I knew, in that instant, it was right outside. Close enough to touch. Close enough to end me if I made a sound.

So I didn’t breathe. Not a gasp. Not a whimper. I lay there, every muscle locked, while time twisted itself into something unrecognizable. Seconds felt like minutes. Minutes felt like hours. The thing waited. And so did I.

And then — as if satisfied, or maybe bored — it moved on. The scraping faded, swallowed by the night.

The lights snapped back. The booth hummed with power again. And the road? Empty. Like nothing had ever been there.

But the notepad told a different story.

Its pages rustled on their own, as if the wind turned them — but the booth was sealed tight. And there, scrawled in jagged, angry writing that looked burned into the paper:

Rule 9: You only get one warning.

I don’t know who writes the rules. I don’t know what writes them. I don’t know why this stretch of highway is cursed — why this patch of blacktop demands so much from anyone foolish enough to man this booth. And somewhere along the way... I stopped asking.

Because some questions only invite answers you can’t survive.

There are nights when the cars that roll through carry faces I know. Faces I loved. Faces I buried. A cousin who died five years ago — smiling behind the wheel like we’re meeting for coffee. My mother — long gone, waving like nothing’s wrong. Old friends. Former neighbors. All dead. All acting like they’re just out for a midnight drive.

And I? I say nothing. I stare at the tolls, at the coins, at anything but them. Because speaking — acknowledging — might open a door I can’t close.

And then there are nights when the watch stays dark. No alerts. No rules. No guidance. And those nights? Those are the worst of all. Because silence on this road doesn’t mean safety. Silence means it’s watching. Waiting. Measuring my resolve. Testing whether I’ll crack.

I tell myself I can’t do this forever. That one day, I’ll walk out of the booth, leave the keys on the desk, and drive until I’m free. And I almost did.

Once.

It was just before dawn. I’d had enough. My bag was packed. My hand was on the door. I told myself: This is it. I’m done. Let someone else play this game.

That’s when the watch turned red.

STAY.

The word bled through the dark like an open wound. And then, the voice followed — that voice that sounds like wind howling through a graveyard:

“Final Rule. If you leave... it follows.”

And that was it. No explanation. No second chance. Just a final, quiet threat that wrapped icy fingers around my spine.

I don’t know what it is. I don’t want to know.

So I’m still here. Watching. Listening. Obeying. Writing new rules each time that cursed watch lights up, adding them to this frayed, stained notebook that has become my last line of defense.

And if you’re hearing this — if you ever find this notebook left behind in an empty booth, pages filled with these rules that don’t make sense but feel heavy with purpose — for God’s sake, don’t ignore it.

Because the booth may stand empty. The chair may sit cold. But the rules? The rules still stand.

And the watch?

The watch will find someone new.

So tell me — when it does, would you be ready?",5,1752463621.0,nosleep,0,0.86,False

Room 209 shouldn’t be on the system.,"I work the night shift at a roadside motel off a forgotten highway. Twelve hours of flickering lights, stale coffee, and guests who don’t want to be remembered.

It’s quiet most nights. Too quiet. And for a while, I liked that. But a few weeks ago, something changed. At exactly 2:00 a.m., the front desk phone rang. Room 209. Which would be normal—if that room wasn’t empty. Had been for days. I answered anyway. Static. Then a voice—faint and wet-sounding—whispered: “Can you see me?”
I hung up. Checked the system. No check-ins. Keys to 209 were still in the drawer. 

I went up anyway. Door locked. Lights off. But when I pressed my ear to it, I heard breathing. Slow. Heavy. Wet. I didn’t open the door.Next night? Same thing. 2:03 a.m. Call from 209.

This time it was whispering. Overlapping voices. Some deep. Some high. One of them was crying. Maintenance changed the lock. Reset the keycard system.Didn’t matter. 2:01 a.m. The phone rang again. “Why won’t you come look?” A child’s voice this time.

I called the cops. They searched the room. Found nothing. Except the smell. One of the officers gagged. Said it was like something had died in the walls. Pest control blamed raccoons. They didn’t check the crawlspace.

A woman checked in later that week. Middle-aged, polite. Passing through. I gave her Room 211—just down the hall from 209. At 3:17 a.m., I saw her on the lobby camera.

Barefoot. Pale. Moving like she was asleep. She walked past the front desk without looking at me. I called out. “Ma’am? Are you okay?” No answer. She turned the corner down the hallway. I followed. She was gone. Hallway camera showed nothing. Like she just vanished. Her car stayed in the lot. Her purse was still in the room. I never saw her again.

The manager told me to keep it quiet. “People disappear here all the time,” he joked. But he didn’t smile. I started keeping the lobby lights off at night. Just the desk lamp. Less glare. I don’t like reflections anymore. Because last Tuesday, the Room 209 camera clicked on.No guest was booked there.

The door was cracked open. The light was on. And someone—something—was standing inside. Facing the wall. Not moving. Arms too long. Too still. I zoomed in. The feed glitched. Then cut out.

When it came back, the figure was closer. Still facing the wall. I locked the front door. I asked Rosa, our morning cleaner, if she ever cleaned 209. She looked at me weird. “That room’s sealed,” she said. “Has been since the fire.” “What fire?”

“Before your time,” she said. “Back when this place was still called The Pine Hill Inn.”
She told me a man lit his family on fire in that room—his wife and daughter. No warning. No motive. 

They say the flames lasted longer than they should’ve. Longer than physics should allow.
The motel didn’t renovate. Just painted over the walls and changed the numbers. Now it’s “Room 209.” But no one’s supposed to stay there. No one.

Last night, I woke up at the desk. Head down. Didn’t remember falling asleep. The security monitor was static. Then it cleared. Room 209. Door wide open.

A little girl stood in the doorway. Hair burnt. Skin blackened. But her face—her face was perfect. Untouched. And she was smiling. I reached for the walkie, but my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

The screen went black. Now I unplug the phone in 209 every night. Doesn’t matter. It still rings.Always at 2:09 a.m. 

Sometimes I answer. All I hear is breathing. And sometimes something else—wet mouth sounds, like lips moving without sound.

Last night, it whispered: “Check the crawlspace.” I haven’t. Not yet. But today, there’s a new smell in the office. Like smoke. And burnt hair.

## Core Benefits

The Coffee Filter 23x9 10 Gallon offers several practical benefits, particularly in commercial settings where large quantities of coffee are required.

**Consistent Brew Quality:** By providing a reliable barrier against coffee grounds escaping into the brewed coffee, these filters ensure a consistent and smooth cup of coffee every time.

The used filter can be easily removed and disposed of, leaving the coffee maker relatively clean. This reduces the time spent on cleaning and maintenance,allowing for quicker turnaround between batches.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial cost of the filters may seem higher compared to smaller, domestic-use filters, the cost per cup of coffee brewed is often lower due to the large batch size. The reduction in labor costs associated with fewer filter changes and easier cleanup also contributes to overall cost savings.

## FAQs Section

**Are these filters compatible with all 10-gallon coffee brewers?**
while designed for 10-gallon brewers, it's crucial to verify that the 23x9 dimensions match the specifications of your particular coffee maker. Different manufacturers may have slight variations in their equipment. Always consult the brewer's manual or contact the manufacturer to confirm compatibility.

**How frequently enough should I change the filter when brewing coffee?**
It is indeed generally recommended to change the filter after each batch of coffee is brewed to ensure optimal flavor and hygiene. Leaving the used grounds in the filter for extended periods can lead to stale flavors and bacterial growth.Regular filter changes are essential for maintaining the quality of the coffee.

**Are there any specific storage requirements for these filters?**
Store the filters in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Excessive humidity can weaken the paper and affect its filtration performance. Proper storage will help maintain the integrity of the filters and ensure they perform as expected.

**Can I reuse these filters to save on costs?**
Reusing these filters is not recommended. The paper becomes weakened after the first use, and the filter's ability to effectively trap coffee grounds is diminished.Reusing filters can also lead to a build-up of oils and sediment, affecting the flavor of subsequent brews.It is indeed best to use a fresh filter for each batch of coffee.

I needed to find her—now.

I stepped off the curb and crossed the street like I was stepping over a boundary I wasn’t meant to see, let alone pass. It felt final. Like something in the town had shifted the moment I made the decision—and now it was watching.

Behind me, the bench creaked softly, a long, tired groan that sounded too alive. As if the town itself had exhaled in warning. Or regret. Or dread.

The walk to the diner stretched unnaturally long, like the sidewalk was folding beneath my feet, trying to slow me down. Every step rang louder than it should’ve. Too loud. Too hollow. The air felt different now—heavier. Thicker. Like the atmosphere had been soaked in something ancient and wrong.

The houses I passed didn’t blink. Windows stared like open eyes. Curtains twitched without wind. Fences leaned too far inward, as if eavesdropping.

The town was listening.

It knows.

The thought came unbidden, and I couldn’t shake it.

I reached the diner, my fingers fumbling on the handle like they didn’t want to open the door. But I did. I pushed through.

The bell overhead chimed once—high and brittle like bone tapping glass. It rang out too clear, too sharp, before being swallowed whole by the stillness inside.

The warmth hit me first—grease and coffee and syrup—but it was dulled somehow. Like a memory of warmth, not the real thing.

I scanned the booths, the counter stools, the long mirror behind the register.

No Mabel.

Just the usual afternoon lull—except everything looked too still.
A man flipping a newspaper with too much care, pages turning in molasses.
A mother cutting up pancakes that never seemed to shrink.
Two teens whispering too softly, like actors who’d forgotten their lines.
Like this was a set—and they were props.

But not Mabel.

Nowhere.

My stomach turned.

I stepped farther in, and the floor let out a groan under my weight—long, slow, as if protesting what I’d brought with me. My shadow stretched ahead of me like it was trying to leave first.

She wasn’t here.

But she had to be somewhere.

A waitress in a pale yellow uniform passed by with a tray of empty mugs. She looked about my age, maybe younger, with a name tag that read Penny in chipped gold lettering.

I stepped forward quickly, catching her attention before she could disappear into the kitchen.

“Hey—sorry,” I said, voice low, tight, “do you know if Mabel’s here today?”

Penny tilted her head, blinking at me. “Oh, nah. Not today.” She popped her gum, like it was just another Tuesday. “It’s her day off. We rotate. My turn today.”

I tried not to let the disappointment show, but something must’ve flickered across my face because Penny’s brows knit together just slightly.

“She alright?” she asked.

I nodded too fast. “Yeah. Yeah, I just… need to talk to her.”

Penny gave a small shrug, already turning away. “Check her place, maybe. If she’s not sleeping, she’s baking.”

Then she vanished behind the kitchen door, tray still clutched in her hands, and I was left standing there alone, heart pounding louder than the dull clink of cutlery in the background.

Her place.

Right.

I turned and walked back out the door, not bothering to wait for the bell this time. The wind outside tugged at my coat like fingers trying to pull me back.

I tightened it around myself and started walking.

I had to find her. Tonight. Before I lost my nerve.

I thanked the waitress—mumbled it, barely audible—and turned on my heel before she could ask anything else. The bell above the door jangled again as I shoved it open, this time shrill and frantic, like it knew I was running out of time.

The sky had begun to bleed into that strange violet haze that comes right before nightfall. The kind of light where things start to lose their shape, blur at the edges. Shadows stretched longer now—reaching, grasping—as I rushed back down the streets.

I didn’t care how it looked.

I didn’t care that the wind was picking up, or that the lamps hadn’t yet flickered on.

I needed to find Mabel.

The streets blurred past me—familiar houses now cast in eerie blue-gray, windows darkened, doors shut tight. No one on the porches. No voices in the yards. Just the rhythmic pound of my shoes on the sidewalk, the sharp slap of my breath in the air.

Every turn felt too long. Every intersection felt like a trap.

But my feet knew the way—muscle memory born from panic and repetition. I’d walked to her place before, but this time was different. Urgent. Desperate. Like if I didn’t reach her, if I didn’t get there now, something would happen. Something permanent.

I sped up. Almost running now.

Past Sparrow Lane. Past the tilted mailbox with the ivy growing up one side. Past the rusted swing set that had never moved, even in wind.

Mabel’s house was near the end.

Alive. Lit from within.

I could see the warm, flickering glow of a lamp behind a curtain—and for a moment, just a moment, the breath caught in my throat.

I was close.

I ran the last few steps.

Raised my hand.

And knocked.

I pounded on the door. “Mabel! Let me in! We need to talk! Now! Now, before it’s too late!”

My voice cracked on the last word, raw and too loud in the stillness.

The porch light buzzed faintly above me, casting a weak yellow glow that seemed to bleed into the dark like ink in water. My fists trembled at my sides, the cold sinking through my jacket, through my skin. I kept glancing over my shoulder, eyes scanning the empty street.

No one was out.

But I felt them. Watching. Judging. Listening from behind curtains and shutters—faces hidden just beyond the glass. Maybe not even people anymore. Just shapes of memory. Hollow things that used to be neighbors.

I pressed my palm flat against the door.

“Mabel,” I begged, voice dropping. “Please. I know what we have to do.”

A click.

Then another.

The lock.

The door creaked open an inch, and Mabel’s wide eyes met mine through the gap. Her face was pale, lips parted in quiet panic.

“Marie?” she whispered, then looked past me—out into the street—like she felt it too.

“Let me in,” I said, barely able to hold my voice steady. “Please.”

She didn’t ask questions.

She opened the door.

And I stepped inside.

Once inside, I collapsed against the wall just past the threshold, the door shutting behind me with a soft but final click.

My chest heaved, breath coming in ragged, shallow pulls like I’d been running for miles. The air inside Mabel’s house was warmer—still held the faint scent of tea and something herbal—but it felt different now. Not quite safe, but safer. Like a hiding place in a forest fire.

I pressed the back of my hand to my mouth, trying to quiet the frantic rhythm of my breathing, trying to slow the pounding in my chest.

Mabel stood a few feet away, her arms crossed tightly over herself like she wasn’t sure whether to comfort me or brace herself for what was coming. Her eyes searched mine.

“Marie…” she said gently, “what happened?”

I shook my head, still breathless, still trembling. My voice came out in a rasp.

“He knows, Mabel. He knows something’s changed. I think—I think he felt it when we read the file. When we saw it all.”

I looked toward the window.

“And now I think he’s watching every move we make.”

I pushed off the wall slowly, wiping the sweat from my brow with a shaking hand. My legs still felt unsteady beneath me, but I had to speak—had to say it before it ate me alive.

""I wasn't going to go back there,"" I whispered. ""I swear I wasn’t. I just… I was walking. Thinking. Trying to clear my head after everything.""

Mabel watched me carefully, her brow tight with worry.

""But the town..."" I swallowed hard. ""It changed on me, Mabel. I didn’t mean to, but somehow—without even noticing—I was just there. In front of the store. Like it pulled me in.""

I met her eyes, voice low and tight. ""And he was waiting. Like he knew I’d end up there.""

She took a step closer, but I kept going. I needed her to hear this.

""He smiled at me. Waved me in like I was just a regular customer. Like nothing had happened. And when I asked him why he didn’t take cash—why memories were the only currency—he told me...""

My throat clenched around the words. Mabel didn’t blink.

""He told me he doesn’t need money. That he feeds off memories. That they keep him content. That he’s happy now. Happier than he ever was when he was still human.""

Her mouth parted slightly, horror flickering in her eyes.

""And then—"" I shook my head, voice breaking. ""Then he asked if I wanted to be like him.""

Silence fell heavy between us.

I forced myself to finish. ""He offered it like it was a gift, Mabel. Like losing everything that makes you you is some kind of freedom.""

Mabel's hand flew to her mouth.

I dropped onto her couch, bones leaden. ""I told him no. But I think… I think he wanted me to come back. He’s not just feeding anymore. He’s recruiting.""

Mabel moved quietly across the room and sat down beside me, her presence calm but steady. Her hand found my shoulder, warm and grounding amidst the cold dread clawing at my chest.

“Is that why you ran all the way here?” she asked softly, her voice barely more than a whisper.

I shook my head, my breath still ragged. “No,” I said fiercely, meeting her eyes. “I ran here because I have a plan. A way to stop this—all of it—before it’s too late.”

She squeezed my shoulder gently, a flicker of hope shining through the exhaustion in her eyes.

“We have to burn it down, Mabel. The store, Stantsman’s hold on this town… everything he’s built with those stolen memories.”

Her gaze dropped to the floor, then back up, resolute. “Then we do it. Together.”

For the first time in days, the weight in my chest lifted, if only a little. We weren’t alone. Not yet.

I felt a rush of relief wash over me when Mabel didn’t hesitate—when she said together. I didn’t even have to ask.

“Yes! Together,” I said, my voice trembling with a mixture of fear and fierce hope. “Pack your bags. We’ll burn that place to the ground. Every last corner, every rotten secret. Then we take my van, leave this town behind us, and find a new one. A town full of life, of love. Somewhere safe. Far away from that store and whatever he’s become.”

Mabel’s eyes flickered with a strange, fierce light—like the first spark before a wildfire.

Mabel jumped up, a spark of fierce excitement lighting up her eyes. “Yes! Burn it!” she exclaimed, almost breathless. “I never thought of that — we can burn it. I’ll pack my bags right away. Please, don’t leave me behind after that. I can’t stay in this miserable town any longer.”

I stood, pulling her into a tight embrace. Her trembling arms wrapped around me, holding on as if this was the only thing keeping her grounded.

“Soon,” I whispered, voice thick with hope and determination, “soon we’ll be free. And this town... this town will be free too.”

For the first time in a long time, the weight of dread loosened just enough to let a fragile light break through. We were ready to fight back. Ready to end it all. Together.

The fading light outside pressed cold and urgent against the windows, like the last desperate breath before night swallowed the world whole. Shadows bled into every corner, pooling thick and slow, crawling up the walls and stretching long fingers that seemed to grip the room itself. Time was slipping away, slipping like sand through trembling hands.

“There’s still enough daylight,” I said, voice low and razor-sharp, slicing through the heavy silence that wrapped around us like a shroud. “I’ll go to the gas station. Get what we need. Tomorrow—we act. Meet me at the store.”

My gaze locked onto hers, searching for that flicker of hope, that spark of defiance I needed to believe in.

“We do this together. Burn it down. Reduce that place to ash and smoke.”

I swallowed hard, the words thick and final in my throat, a promise and a reckoning all at once.

“Pack your bags. Bring everything you’ll need. Load them into my van—the blue one, painted with butterflies. The back doors will be unlocked. Just for you.”

She blinked, a flicker of fear flashing across her face—brief, almost ghostly—before her jaw clenched tight, resolve settling like iron.

No more hesitation. No more waiting.

The night was coming. Dark and endless.

And with it, our chance.

There was no turning back now. Not ever.

I didn’t wait for a response. I pushed myself up, the weight of what we’d just decided pressing heavy on my chest. The shadows outside had deepened, swallowing the last remnants of daylight.

The door creaked closed behind me, muffling the soft thud of my footsteps as I hurried away.

The town felt colder now, quieter—like it was holding its breath, watching, waiting.

I walked with purpose, each step echoing against empty sidewalks and shuttered windows until I reached my house.

Inside, the familiar creak of the floorboards grounded me for a moment, but there was no comfort in the walls tonight.

I moved quickly, grabbing the keys off the table and heading to the driveway.

There she was—my van. Painted bright blue with chipped butterfly decals fading in the twilight.

The driver door unlocked with a soft click as I slid inside, the worn seats and familiar scent welcoming me like an old friend.

I started the engine, the rumble steady beneath me, and stared out into the darkened street.

Tomorrow was coming.

And nothing would ever be the same.

I pulled into the gas station beneath the flickering neon sign, its pale red glow sputtering like a dying heartbeat against the thick night. The air was heavy—tinged with gasoline, dust, and the faint scent of something long forgotten, like the residue of secrets clinging to cracked pavement.

Inside, I moved with practiced ease, like any other customer lost in indecision. My eyes roamed the cramped aisles, pretending to weigh options I didn’t need to make, all the while aware of the silence pressing close behind me.

At the back, my fingers curled around two small, red gas cans. They were heavier than they looked, their cold plastic biting into my palms like they held the weight of everything I was about to do.

Carrying them to the register, I found the clerk slouched behind the counter, half-absorbed in his phone, his expression blank but watchful—like he sensed the night was thick with something more than just fuel and errands.

Without breaking my calm, I reached up and plucked two lighters from the front display, flicking them idly between my fingers—a quiet dance with danger.

I set the cans down with deliberate care, voice low and steady. “This and twenty again. Need to refill these.”

He nodded, scanning the items with mechanical precision, his eyes flicking up for just a moment—too quick to catch, but enough to feel like a silent warning.

I paid, slipping the lighters into my coat, every movement deliberate but trembling beneath the surface.

Stepping back outside, the night seemed to hold its breath. The cool air wrapped around me like a cloak, thick with anticipation and dread.

Every step back to my van thudded like a pulse in the dark—measuring time, counting down to the moment when everything would burn.

The plan was no longer just an idea.

It was alive.

And it was coming.

I stood by the pump, the cold metal nozzle in my hand, the gas trickling steadily into the red cans. The click of the trigger echoed sharper than it should’ve in the stillness—too loud in a place that felt so deserted.

The neon sign above me buzzed faintly, casting everything in that sickly, pulsing glow. It made the world look washed out—unreal. Like I had slipped sideways into a version of the town that had forgotten how to be alive.

I glanced around.

No cars. No footsteps. Not even the hum of distant voices. Just bushes rustling in the wind, their leaves shivering like they were nervous too. A crushed can rolled across the cracked pavement, rattling along its edge before spinning to a stop against the curb.

I tightened my grip on the nozzle.

The air felt wrong—not just cold, but watchful. Like the shadows were studying me from places just out of reach.

I capped the first can, set it down with a dull thunk, and started on the second.

Soon, both cans were full—topped off, sealed tight, every drop accounted for. The smell of gasoline clung to my hands, soaked into the cuffs of my coat, sharp and heady. It coated my throat like smoke that hadn’t started yet.

Both cans were full now—sealed tight and sloshing quietly as I lifted them into the back of the van. They clanked against each other as I secured them, a dull metallic sound that felt heavier than it should’ve. Not just fuel. Not just plastic.

Intent. That’s what they carried.

The air was sharp with fumes, the ghost of gasoline clinging to my skin, my jacket, the creases in my palms. I stood for a moment beneath the buzzing canopy lights, scanning the lot.

Still empty.

No cars. No voices. Just the quiet rustle of wind dragging through the brush at the edge of the lot, and a single empty soda can rolling past my foot like something fleeing the scene.

I glanced toward the station’s dark windows. The kid behind the counter hadn’t even looked up when I walked out. Good. He didn’t need to remember me.

I stepped into the van and pulled the door closed with a low, final thud. Inside, the silence was thick. The smell of gas hovered like a threat in the air.

I reached into my coat pocket and pulled out the two lighters, placing them carefully in the center console cubby between the seats. Just plastic and metal. Disposable. Innocent-looking.

And yet they felt like loaded weapons. 

I gripped the steering wheel and took one deep breath—steady, slow. Then I turned the key.

The engine rumbled to life, louder than usual, vibrating through the frame of the van like something waking up.

I pulled away from the gas station, tires crunching over old gravel and broken glass.

The road home was empty, but not peaceful. The streetlights flickered as I passed beneath them, one after the other, casting long, distorted shadows across the pavement. The houses loomed silent on either side, their windows too dark, too still.

It felt like the town was holding its breath.

Like it knew.

I didn’t speed. I didn’t dawdle.

I just drove—with two full gas cans in the back, lighters between the seats, and the weight of tomorrow bearing down on my spine.

This was it.

No turning back. No mercy left.

Tomorrow, the store would burn.

And I’d make sure it stayed that way.

The house was silent when I pulled up—dark, still, like it was bracing itself for what was coming.

I locked the van, gave one last glance at the back to make sure the cans were steady and sealed. They were. Waiting. Just like me.

Inside, I stripped off my clothes the second the door shut behind me. My skin still carried the ghost of gasoline—sharp, acrid, clinging to the folds of fabric, the spaces between my fingers. I stepped into the shower and let the water run hot. Too hot.

Steam curled around me, filled the room like fog, thick and suffocating.

But I needed it.

Needed to feel clean. Needed to feel like myself again—even if it was temporary. Even if it was borrowed.

I stood there longer than I meant to, staring at the tiles, letting the heat soak into my bones. I didn’t think. Didn’t let myself. Not yet.

Once dry, I dressed in clean clothes—comfortable, layered, ready to run. Then I packed.

It didn’t take long. I hadn’t brought much to this town. I hadn’t bought anything, either. Not from him. Not from that store.

Three small bags. That was all.

One small duffel held my clothes, neatly folded: a few shirts, jeans, a sweater I always reached for when the nights grew cold, and my worn-down boots. Stuffed in the side pocket were socks, underthings, and my toothbrush and brush, both tucked in a plastic bag like I was going on a weekend trip, not fleeing something monstrous.

The second bag held essentials—deodorant, soap, the little pouch of bandages and aspirin I always carried, a flashlight, and a few granola bars I’d never eaten. The mundane things that somehow felt like armor now.

The third was for the things that mattered most.

A soft leather notebook, pages dog-eared and stained with years of scribbles and thoughts I didn’t want to lose. A picture of my family—crinkled, a little faded, but still warm with memory. My charger, a few crumpled bills, and the old necklace my grandmother gave me the year before she died.

That was it.

Three bags. My whole life—what was left of it—shrink-wrapped and ready to go.

I zipped the last bag shut and stood there for a moment in the quiet room, staring at the pale wallpaper, the cracked ceiling, the crooked mirror above the dresser.

And as I looked at them, lined up like soldiers waiting for orders, the weight of tomorrow settled over me.

This was the last night.
The last time this house—this town—would hold me.

And if everything went as planned…
It would be the last night that thing drew breath inside a place called home.

Tomorrow, this place would be behind me.

But tonight, I still had to sleep inside its walls.

I hauled the bags one by one through the front door, the hinges groaning like they already knew this was goodbye. The air outside had cooled—thick with night, but still and quiet. Like the whole town was holding its breath.

I slid open the side door of the van, the familiar click of the track grounding me in the moment. One by one, I set the bags on the back seat, tucking them in securely, checking the zippers like they might burst open from the weight of everything they carried. Not just clothes. Not just essentials.
 
Hope. Escape. The promise of something better.

I stepped back, scanned the interior one more time, then slowly shut the side door—click—leaving only the back doors unlocked, just like I told Mabel. Just for her.

I walked around to the driver’s side, my fingers trailing over the warm metal, and paused as my eyes caught on one of the butterfly stickers. Bright pink, peeling just a little at the edges, still clinging stubbornly to the glass like it refused to be dulled by this place.

I smiled—small, tired, but real.

Then I locked every door. One after the other. Driver’s side. Passenger. Side doors.

Only the back remained.

A silent invitation.

A promise.

Tomorrow.

1lzbre6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lzbre6/red_sparrow_reborn/,Red sparrow reborn.,"There’s a particular kind of peace that comes from chopping wood.

Not the Zen monk type. More like a primal rhythm—swing, crack, repeat—that drowns out the noise in your head. For me, that noise comes with names, faces, and the weight of a past soaked in blood.

I was knee-deep in firewood behind my cabin when I saw her—little Lucy Hayes—arms folded, chin up, face defiant like her mother’s.

“Mr. Walker,” she called. “My mom says you’re not weird, just quiet. I told her that means you’re probably cool.”

I grunted and went back to splitting logs.

She didn’t leave.

Eventually, I offered her a cup of hot cocoa, and that became routine. Lucy was the kind of light that people like me aren’t supposed to be near. And yet, every afternoon she’d knock, kick off her shoes, and ramble about school, cartoons, and how gross boys are.

Then three nights ago, she disappeared.


---

When I found the front door to the Hayes home busted in, I knew before I stepped over the threshold that the past I buried had clawed its way to the surface.

The living room was wrecked—coffee table shattered, blood on the corner of the wall. Her mother, Joanna, was unconscious, pulse erratic but there. I didn’t call the cops.

I called him.

“Ethan,” came the voice, smooth and rehearsed. “How’s retirement?”

“Cut the shit. Is it Sparrow?”

A pause.

“I’m afraid some ghosts don’t stay buried. They're restarting it. Version 2.0. They want the old assets back.”

“She’s just a kid.”

“That’s why they took her. To get to you. They’re using children now—hostages, leverage, trainees. You're still on file as 'viable stock.’”

My hands curled into fists.

“Where?”

He gave me a location in Michigan. An old decommissioned military facility. Remote. Secure. Sparrow’s new nest.


---

Two days later I was driving across state lines in a rusted-out Bronco, gear in the back and rage in my chest.


---

I’d once been Ethan Walker—Asset 014—part of the Red Sparrow Protocol, a black-ops program designed to forge killers from trauma and science. We weren’t trained, we were engineered. Broken down and rebuilt with surgical cruelty. By 21, I’d killed for five different governments. By 26, I walked away.

Retired to a cabin in the mountains, buried my weapons, changed my name legally, and prayed that whatever was left of my soul could be salvaged.

But the thing about predators is they always recognize one of their own.


---

I scouted the compound from the trees—three stories, floodlights, and at least six armed guards on patrol. Heat signatures told me it wasn’t just muscle. There were kids inside. Half a dozen. Probably not all kidnapped. Some... were already training.

I waited until nightfall, slipped through the tree line, and reminded myself what it felt like to move like a ghost.


---

The first man died without a sound. Garrote wire to the neck. The second I dropped into the shadows and snapped his neck between my boots. By the time I was inside, alarms hadn’t so much as beeped.

My heartbeat hadn’t changed.

Muscle memory. God help me, it felt good.

I moved through the hallways like a phantom. Cameras were old models, easily looped. I found the server room and fried it, bought myself a window.

I found the cells on the second floor.

Lucy was there—eyes puffy, but alive. She ran to the bars when she saw me.

“Mr. Walker!”

I shushed her, used the thermite charge to melt the lock. The door hissed open.

“I knew you’d come,” she whispered.

“You okay?”

She nodded. “They kept asking me about you. Showed me pictures. Called you a 'walking weapon.’”

“That’s not wrong,” I muttered.

Footsteps. Heavy. Reinforced boots.

I pushed Lucy behind me. The door burst open.

I knew him instantly. Ivan Malek. My old handler. Built like a tank, eyes like ice, voice like gravel over bones.

“Ethan,” he said, drawing a custom sidearm. “You're looking well. For a ghost.”

“You always talked too much.”

I threw a flashbang. He flinched—too slow—and I rushed him.

We collided like bulls. He was stronger. But I was faster.

I drove my elbow into his throat, ducked under the wild swing of his pistol, twisted his arm, and dislocated his shoulder with a pop that made Lucy scream.

But he was laughing.

“You still got it,” he rasped. “Good. You’ll need it.”

He dropped a remote.

The floor trembled.

Red Alert Activated.

Steel doors slammed shut. Sirens howled. Gas hissed from vents.

Shit.

I grabbed Lucy, broke through a side panel, and crawled into the ductwork.


---

We moved like rats, the compound crawling with awakened guards and trainees now armed to the teeth. One of the kids—no older than 13—nearly caught us. He had dead eyes. Moved like I used to. I didn’t kill him.

But I made sure he couldn’t walk for a while.


---

We reached the weapons vault.

I punched in the old override. The kind no one remembers unless they designed the system. Inside, racks of experimental gear. Knives, guns, tools not meant for war but for efficient, silent annihilation.

I took what I needed.

The fire returned to my blood. For the first time in years, I wasn’t running from the monster in me—I was unleashing it.


---

We moved toward the extraction point I’d mapped.

Ten guards blocked the hangar entrance. I counted five rifles, two submachine guns, three melee units with high-torque exo-gauntlets.

I turned to Lucy.

“You stay hidden. No matter what you hear.”

Her lip trembled. “Please don’t leave me.”

I placed my hand on her shoulder.

“I’m not. I’m clearing the way.”

I stepped into the hangar like I was walking into a church.

The first bullet never reached me. My blade was already inside the shooter’s throat. I spun, kicked off a crate, landed behind two others, and shot both point-blank with their own guns.

The rest opened fire.

I danced between them. This wasn’t combat. It was art. The kind you paint in red.

When the last one dropped, I was soaked in blood and something deeper—regret.

But Lucy was safe.


---

We got to the helipad.

Of course, he was waiting.

Ivan stood in the rain, holding a detonator and a machete. His arm was freshly splinted, blood leaking from under the wrap.

“I taught you too well,” he grinned. “Let’s finish this, Ethan. Like the old days.”

I turned to Lucy.

“When the chopper lands, get in. No matter what happens.”

She nodded, eyes wide.

Ivan charged.

I met him halfway.

Steel clashed. Fists flew. We bled, screamed, broke bones, kept going. I didn’t fight to win. I fought to survive her.

He slammed the machete into my shoulder. I howled, drove my thumb into his eye socket.

He staggered.

I took the machete and ended it.

Fast. Clean.

For once.


---

The chopper blades cut through the rain as it landed. A former Sparrow pilot I trusted was inside.

Lucy climbed in.

I turned away.

She grabbed my hand. “Aren’t you coming?”

I shook my head. “I don’t belong out there.”

She looked at me. “You’re not a monster.”

I didn’t answer. Just watched her go.


---

I burned the compound to the ground.

Buried what remained.

Red Sparrow was dead. For now.


---

A week later, I got a letter.

Crayon drawings. Smiley faces. And one sentence:

“If you’re ever in town again, my mom makes the best pancakes.”

I smiled for the first time in years.

And for the first time, I wondered if maybe… just maybe… there was life after blood.

But until then, I’ll be here.

Chopping wood.

Swing. Crack. Repeat.

1lzbkbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/capetown/comments/1lzbkbt/my_cape_town_experience/,My Cape Town experience.,"I was in CPT for almost four months. When people ask me how was it, the short description’s 

“Do you know the movie Bird Box?” That’s how it felt.” 

People kept advising me to not to talk to people, to not go eye contact. If you hear anything, just continue walking as if you didn’t hear anything. Which is basically the scene from that movie - only blindfolded. 

I love talking to people so I didn’t believe them. Until I have experienced some rude people and the street dwellers (but not minors) or high “brother(s)/sister(s)”. The man who chased me when I said NO when he asked for my name. The man jacking off while walking at broad daylight. Or the man who followed me around inside Checkers just because I replied to his question which I thought he’s asking about a product. Turns out he’s asking for alms. 

Sure we have that too in our country but not in CBD. In CPT, you’ll get to encounter them about 5 in every 30 minutes?

Will I go back to CPT? Yes. Sure. I love it. Love the food, the fact that veggies and some fruits are affordable. 

I love the people who chase the rude ones away They protected me. I love the way strangers hype people up (in a good way). “Ooh fashion, sister!!! Every time I see you, you have nice bags on.” And sorts.  

The people I worked with. They walked me to and fro the hotel just to make sure I’m safe. They didn’t need to but they insist. “You’re in the most dangerous city in the world.” That’s what they said. 

“Don’t go to Long street alone.” Too late for that. Lol.  I did already 😅 alone. I walked down that road, drank coffee, ate at the “oldest restaurant” (how many are there? Hahahaha) haggled with the sellers on Church Street. Took street pictures. Luckily my phone’s still with me 😅

Will I do it again? Yes. I can’t get enough of Cape Town. I actually fell in love with it. ",15,1752462258.0,capetown,1,0.89,False

My Journey with “Why?” and “What If?,"I’ve always been the kid who asked “why” until adults ran out of answers. Why does the sky turn pink at sunset? Why do clocks tick? Why can’t we make a battery that lasts forever? As I grew older, that curiosity shifted to the things around me—how my laptop charger works, why certain materials resist heat, or what makes a drill more powerful than another.

A few years ago, I started a “curiosity journal.” Every time I encounter something I don’t understand, I write it down. Then, when I have 15 minutes, I pick one question and dig into it. Last week’s entry: “Why do fire extinguishers have different colors?” Turns out, the colors indicate the type of fire they put out—red for general use, blue for flammable metals (who knew that was a thing?), and yellow for fats and oils. Fascinating, right?

Another entry: “What if we used magnets to sort recycling?” I spent an afternoon watching videos about magnetic separation in factories, where powerful magnets pull iron and steel from other materials. Now I notice it every time I drop off my recycling—those conveyor belts aren’t just moving stuff around; they’re using science to make sorting easier.

But here’s the thing: curiosity can feel tiring sometimes. There’s so much to learn, and I’ll never know it all. I’ve started asking friends to share their “weird facts” over coffee, or joining online talks about industrial innovations. It helps to turn it into a community thing—like we’re all exploring together.

How do you nurture your sense of curiosity? Do you have a routine, a book, or a hobby that keeps you asking questions? Are there topics in industrial science or engineering that you’ve always wanted to dive into but haven’t had the chance?

1lzbgji,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lzbgji/i_went_to_a_brewery_this_weekend/,I went to a brewery this weekend,"I’m a little over 3 years sober now, but have moved back to my hometown due to going through a divorce. The last time I lived here I was drinking excessively and could never quit for long. I credit a lot of my sobriety to my soon to be ex wife as we got sober as a team (her to improve her health and me because I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol). 

Now that I am back where I grew up and am in a “re-evaluate every last piece of my life” phase, not gonna lie the thought has entered my mind of “well, do I want to eventually try drinking again?”

This weekend I met up with some old and close friends at a brewery, and since I’ve been so far removed from drinking I wasn’t really tempted to get alcohol. But again, seeing my friends try different cool looking beers had me questioning if I wanted this change to be permanent. 

I ended up getting a few different Athletic Brewing beers (they are NA and awesome btw) as well as a cold brew coffee just to have something “fun”, and had a great time. 

And you know what? I didn’t feel like I was missing out at all. I closed out my very inexpensive tab, drove back without any fear of getting pulled over, went for a run later in the day, and then I woke up early today for a long run (currently training for a 50k). If I had been drinking, I would have paid way too much money and have been paranoid driving back, and I would have felt like shit the rest of the day like I always used to after day drinking. And I most certainly would not have woken up early to go knock out a 15 mile run the next morning.

Sorry for the long post but I just felt like sharing as it was a good reminder that alcohol has done nothing but take from me, and simply not drinking alcohol makes it possible for me to make the most of every other part of my life.

And the weirdest thing is that stuff on my desk go missing and then reappearing where I left them. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it and just have short memory loss. The first one that went missing was my pen, followed by my post-it pad. Next couple of items included my ID and then my water bottle. And it's not like I go to the restroom and then all of a sudden they're gone. The pen, for instance, went missing while I was looking for something in my bag. Next thing I know it wasn't on my desk. Sometimes, I go to the conference room for a call or try to get some coffee, and I can see my colleague just on his desk. So i'm 100% sure it's not his doing. I told this to HR and they suggested checking the security footage but I'm a bit of a wimp for declining. Nope, sorry, ignorance is bliss in my life. I'd rather not see a pen moving and then reappearing on my desk lol

Interestingly, my colleague just puts on his headphones during out shift and listens to music. I can't do that. I feel like need to be able to hear things or at least sense them with my hearing and be prepared for what's to come rather than use my headphones lol.

1lzb7e5,https://i.redd.it/hip2xlx71rcf1.png,Finally introducing my first OC—Pomelo Von Grazioso,"Well, finally finished the full profile for him. Apologies in advance for the length, especially the semblance section:  


**Basic Information:**

Name: Pomelo Von Grazioso  
Age: 18  
Gender: Male  
Species: Human  
Sexuality: Straight

**Physical Appearance:**

Pomelo has an elegant, slender figure, standing at 5'11"" with a beige skin tone. He has an oval-shaped face with sharp, aristocratic features—high cheekbones, a long, straight nose, and a pointed chin. His eyes are narrow and grey in colour, peering above delicately arched eyebrow ridges. He wears thin, silver-framed glasses over his eyes. Pomelo has lightly tanned skin and wavy, dark brown hair that he keeps neatly styled and tied back in a short ponytail with a black ribbon, though in combat, he allows some strands to come loose and frame both sides of his face rakishly.

**History:**

Hailing from the kingdom of Atlas, Pomelo was born into the prestigious Grazioso family, who for generations have produced some of the most gifted artists, musicians, and huntsmen in Remnant. However, unlike many Atlas elite families who've grown cold and calculating in their pursuit of power, the Grazioso lineage has maintained its core values of compassion, artistic integrity, and genuine service to others. Pomelo's parents, a world-renowned violin virtuoso and a teacher at an Atlas Academy, respectively, have built a reputation for benevolent endeavours. Pomelo's father performs charity concerts for underprivileged districts, and his mother champions inclusive education. She implements scholarship programmes for talented students from all backgrounds, treating every student with equal respect and care. As early as age four, Pomelo exhibited immense musical talent on the violin and piano. However, his parents were careful to nurture not just his prodigious abilities but also his character. They taught him that privilege comes with responsibility and that true nobility lies in uplifting others rather than looking down upon them. His privileged upbringing enabled enrolment at the most elite combat and musical conservatories, but the Grazioso family ensured these opportunities came with regular volunteer work at local shelters and community centres. Rigorous daily practice and schooling groomed Pomelo in equal measure into a disciplined fighter and child prodigy composer, while weekly family trips to serve meals at homeless shelters and perform for veterans' hospitals kept him grounded in the reality of others' struggles.  
Even though Pomelo was under pressure to carry the Grazioso flame into the arts, his family never imposed rigid expectations. When he expressed interest in enrolling at Beacon Academy in Vale at age eighteen, it wasn't rebellion against his family—it was actually encouraged by them. His parents recognised that despite their efforts to keep him grounded, he'd still been somewhat sheltered by Atlas's elite circles. They believed that training at Beacon, with its more diverse student body and less rigid social hierarchy, would help him grow into the kind of huntsman and person they'd raised him to be.

**Personality and Behaviour:**

Pomelo carries himself with refined grace and dignity befitting his high societal upbringing. He speaks in clear diction, using an expansive vocabulary with a subtle posh Atlas accent. His default demeanour tends towards being reserved and sober, though the occasional dry quip or sardonic comment betrays his cultured wit. As part of Pomelo's noble heritage, he firmly believes in etiquette, principles, and intellectual pursuits—art, music, and literature. Pomelo's dedication to his intellectual pursuits is evident in his vast knowledge and ability to engage in thoughtful conversations on a wide range of topics. However, his aristocratic leanings also convey shades of arrogance, elitism, and being unaccustomed to more rugged ways of life. He turns up his nose at uncultured behaviours, finding the rowdy and irreverent lifestyle of some huntsmen rather base.  
Despite his sometimes haughty exterior, Pomelo genuinely struggles with the disconnect between his privileged upbringing and his family's humanitarian values. He often finds himself torn between his instinctive reaction to ""lesser"" behaviour and his deeply ingrained understanding that all people deserve respect and dignity. This internal conflict manifests in moments of genuine vulnerability, where his composed facade cracks to reveal someone desperately trying to live up to his family's benevolent legacy while battling his own ingrained prejudices.

**Weapon:**  
Pomelo wields his violin (Wolfgang Flax) as his signature weapon. In its dormant form, the Wolfgang Flax appears as an ornate viola crafted from polished black metal with intricate silver accents and mother-of-pearl inlays. The strings shimmer like steel razor wire, perpetually tuned to deadly precision. With a twist on one of the tuning pegs, the violin undergoes a swift transformation—from scroll to fine tuners split into two, forming the limbs of the bow, with the chinrest and tailpiece forming the grip and arrow shelf. The strings merge into a taut bowstring, ready to release Doloresa, the violin bow. It can be fired from and returned to the Wolfgang Flax like a boomerang. Doloresa can also be used as a sort of dagger/short sword, the hair of it serving as a sharp edge for close combat.

**Semblance: Orchestra**

Pomelo's Semblance is intrinsically tied to his musical expertise and manifests as spectral musical notation that appears when he plays his violin or any other musical instrument. Each note played produces a glowing, ethereal version of its written form that possesses unique properties based on the note's duration and musical value. These spectral notes can be manipulated and combined to create complex musical combat strategies.

***Spectral Note Properties:***

* *Semibreve (Whole Note):* The largest and most durable spectral notes, appearing as glowing orbs roughly the size of dinner plates. These serve as immovable barriers or platforms that can withstand tremendous force. Pomelo often uses them as shields against attacks or stepping stones for aerial manoeuvres. They last the longest of all note types but require significant Aura to maintain.
* *Minim (Half Note):* Medium-sized constructs that function as mobile projectiles or temporary restraints. They can be launched at enemies with considerable force or used to bind opponents by wrapping around limbs. Minims maintain moderate durability and can be sustained for extended periods with reasonable Aura expenditure.
* *Crotchet (Quarter Note):* The most versatile and commonly used notes in Pomelo's arsenal. These appear as compact, dart-like projectiles that can pierce through light armour and Grimm hide. They're highly manoeuvrable and can change direction mid-flight through Pomelo's conducting. Crochets offer the best balance of power, speed, and aura efficiency.
* *Quaver (Eighth Note):* Rapid-fire ammunition that appears in clusters, creating overwhelming barrages of smaller projectiles. While individually weak, their sheer number makes them excellent for suppressing enemies or creating diversions. Quavers are extremely Aura-efficient and can be produced in rapid succession.
* *Semiquaver (Sixteenth Note):* The smallest and fastest notes, appearing as tiny sparks that move at incredible speeds. These are primarily used for precision strikes on weak points or as a form of musical ""static"" that can disrupt enemy senses and communication. They require minimal Aura but have very limited individual impact.
* *Dotted Notes:* Any note with a dot beside it gains enhanced properties—increased durability, extended range, or additional effects. However, they consume 50% more Aura to create and maintain.

**Fighting Style:**  
Pomelo's fighting style reflects his musical training and aristocratic upbringing, emphasising precision, timing, and fluid transitions between his weapon's dual forms. In violin mode, he wields the Wolfgang Flax as both a defensive tool and a close-quarters weapon, using the reinforced body to parry attacks while the razor-sharp strings can slice through armour and flesh with surgical precision. His movements mirror a virtuoso performance—each strike, block, and counterattack flows seamlessly into the next like measures in a complex musical composition. When shifting to bow form, Pomelo demonstrates the discipline of countless hours spent perfecting his archery, launching Doloresa with the methodical precision of a master marksman. When pressed defensively, Pomelo creates walls of linked semibreves and minims, using the latter as stepping stones to gain aerial advantage before raining down semiquaver tracking projectiles. Quaver projectiles streak toward enemies in staccato bursts while crotchet chains bind and restrict movement, all while minim platforms allow him to maintain superior positioning above the battlefield. His combat stance maintains the poise of a concert performer, with feet positioned with ballet-like grace, shoulders squared, and breathing controlled even in the heat of battle. Pomelo treats each engagement as a carefully orchestrated performance, reading his opponents' rhythms and patterns before exploiting their weaknesses with calculated strikes. He favours hit-and-run tactics, using his superior mobility and range to maintain distance while peppering enemies with precisely aimed shots, occasionally closing in for devastating string-based attacks when the moment is right. 

**Weaknesses;**

* Physically weaker and lacking in strength, prioritises speed, accuracy, and strategy over strength
* Refusal to sacrifice appearance for combat practicality
* His semblance is tied to his ability to play; if his hands are injured or his instrument damaged, his effectiveness diminishes significantly
* The spectral notes' effectiveness can be disrupted by extremely loud sounds or sonic attacks that interfere with his musical precision.
* Semblance requires constant musical input to maintain, meaning he must continue playing to keep spectral notes active.
* Sometimes paralysed by the weight of family expectations and his desire to live up to their benevolent legacy
* Struggles with genuine connection to those he perceives as ""beneath"" his social station, despite knowing intellectually that this is wrong.

**Likes;**

* Orchestra and classical music performances
* Fine dining and culinary arts
* Strategy games like chess or croquet
* Attending elite social galas and soirees
* Philosophical discussions and literary analysis
* Charitable work and humanitarian causes (though he sometimes approaches these with an awkward, overly formal manner)
* Teaching music to underprivileged children (one of his genuine passions)

**Dislikes;**

* Getting blood, dirt, or grime on his fine clothes
* Overly aggressive or unstrategic battle tactics
* Reality television and what he considers ""lowbrow"" entertainment
* Crude or uncouth behaviour
* Coffee (considers it ""plebeian sludge"")
* Situations where his privileged background makes others uncomfortable
* Having to explain cultural references that he considers ""basic knowledge""

**Miscellaneous Facts:**

* Secretly collects pressed autumn leaves, finding them beautiful despite their ""common"" nature
* Has never consumed coffee a day in his life and scoffs at the plebeian ""sludge"".
* Insists on hand-tailored dress shoes with elevated heels to subtly boost his height.
* Donates a significant portion of his personal allowance to various charities, following his family's example.
* Sometimes practises his violin late at night when homesick, playing pieces his mother taught him.
* Has memorised the names and backgrounds of every servant in the Grazioso household and personally ensures they receive excellent treatment and benefits.
* Has never used a public restroom and will hold it for hours rather than compromise his standards.
* Secretly practises common expressions and slang in his room to better fit in with his Beacon classmates.



Anyways, that the whole character, a lot of information, sorry, if you have any questions/ideas on Pomelo, you can leave them and such, anyways, that is that and have a nice day.

I started with an antimicrobial with berberine/oregano oil and neem but have decided to find the root cause (motility) and solve that before going again. 

Yes the low fodmap diet is boring but there are things that help to spice it up. Liquid smoke is awesome just check ingredients for triggers. The one I found at the health food store has bugger all in it and it’s an easy way to give boring food depth of flavour. Also spices like cumin, tumeric and ground coriander seed (check ingredients - just threw out a heap of ours as they contained wheat and were causing issues) with lime juice and fresh ginger is a great way to make chicken delicious. Just find what works through research and keep things SIMPLE. It helps to identify triggers. 

Now I know most of the people here have spent hundreds if not thousands on supplements and whatnot. I’m in the high hundreds so far. In my experience I wish I had kept it simple to start with. Identify your root issue and supplement to assist. I’m having ginger and artichoke with black coffee on an empty stomach in the morning and that helps get things moving. When you are ready for a kill phase there is plenty of info on this sub already about what works so I’ll leave that topic alone as I’m not too familiar with it. 

Loads of posts in here about how depressing this is and I wholeheartedly agree. BUT it does get better and managing it does become easier. Find safe foods like you like. Bulk make meals to keep your diet on track and prep snacks for in between meals, I have kiwi fruits and tuna, cucumber and small amount of mayo. Cutting all carbs and most sugars also helped me a lot, I suspect CSID and SIBO caused by that or there may be other things I don’t know about yet. Just gotta keep listening to your body and altering things based on that. ",2,1752461046.0,SIBO,0,0.75,False
1lzb5ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHallowdineLibrary/comments/1lzb5ur/a_recipe_for_hatred/,A Recipe For Hatred,"Challinor Close is not a place many people visit. A dead end, lost amongst a tangle of narrow roads in the high hills beside the river, it is easily overlooked and leads nowhere. Those hills, and the gardens of the few houses perched on them, are all lush with verdant overgrowth. It is as though the soil is particularly fertile here, and the residents of those turn-of-the-century homes of brick and pine can never quite keep up with the hungry demands of nature.  
I first chanced upon the area as a teenager, obsessed with rollerblading. My quest for speed took me up to the ends of the highest roads, where I could race down the steep and twisting footpaths like a red-haired streak of lightning. And I still remember first discovering the house at the end of the Close, its bounds marked by crumbling red-brick walls, draped with moss which wept dark liquid onto the road. Beyond the walls and gigantic trees, I glimpsed a spire, and the dome of a huge conservatory, the bronze arc of its struts dull with a creeping patina of green, its glass fusted with mildew.  
A house like that holds a sort of otherworldly enchantment, as though it is slightly out of time with the rest of the world. And that first time I peered at it, I felt *observed*. But I was a very sensible, practical child; and in those days my only real concern with the the house at the end of Challinor Close was that it meant I had reached the apex of my skating route.  
It’s strange, remembering that girl, so naturally bold and unafraid. So free. The thought of her barrelling down that steep maze of roads with only reflexes, wits and kneepads to protect her still makes my throat tighten.  
Because my fearlessness was finally rewarded with what my parents had always feared the most – as I emerged from the shadow of one street and tore across an intersection, a car hit me.  
I have no memory of the accident at all, just what I was told. My recollections of the first weeks in hospital are hazy, just warped time and a constant boil of distant pain, its flame turned low by all the drugs. After they had pinned and wired my bones back together, I spent a long time on the ward, staring mindlessly at the television above my bed – numbed as much by day-time soaps as by the endless pills.  
When I was finally allowed to go home, I barely recognised myself. My trendy skater-girl clothes hung loose from my pallid, skinny bones, and the hair I’d always kept so proudly spiked short had grown down to my collar in a lacklustre flop.  
My parents encouraged me to put my blades back on, offered radical haircuts and new clothes, even though Mum and I had once clashed daily about my stylistic choices. They both did everything they could to help me reclaim the vibrant identity I’d once so eagerly worn, but I couldn’t. That fearless, free girl was gone; replaced by someone drained of her colour and her confidence. This new creature was smaller, weaker, and terribly afraid of the dangers of the world she had to learn to navigate. And she was even more afraid of the power of the strong, careless people who lived in it.

   
Although my parents and teachers continued to encourage me back into sports and physical activities, the lingering pain of my injuries, and the listless cobwebs left by the grey hospital limbo held me back. I wallowed, and I fretted. I played up the aches in my recently knitted bones, and I worried at my scars with my nails, inflaming them until the pain was fiery and real.  
I felt like everything had fallen to pieces, and that it was all my own doing. In my head I’d deserved this somehow, I had taken a wrong turn and ruined any chance I had of a normal life. And it didn’t help that everyone around me couldn’t see that it was my fault, that they were so kind and sympathetic. I was a story to them. And there is no more tragic story than the one about the popular, athletic girl who is involved in a dreadful accident and can never swing a softball bat again, at least not without her wrists clicking audibly and painfully. And I saw their eyes, averted but still so proud of their own pity and kindness, when it became obvious that I couldn’t run to first base without stumbling as my bad leg gave out under me.  
If I said I hated the physical therapy, I’d be lying. When that vital part of me had died in the accident, had emptied that wellspring of passion and ambition, it took with it my ability to feel reckless, powerful emotions like anger and hate. So I tolerated the endless hours of physio that felt like the punishment I deserved, but I couldn’t even use that pain for good. I had no feelings to use; I just put in the effort that was required of me.  
My father, who had doted on his sporty little girl, coped even less well than I did, probably because he still had feelings. Within two years, the stress of it all, the stress that was *me*, had fractured my parents’ marriage beyond repair. Dad moved out of our house at the bottom of the hills and into an apartment in the city with his new girlfriend.  
On my sixteenth birthday, my mother said she had a surprise for me. She drove us through the warren of streets and past the scene of my accident. She didn’t stop there, but carried on up through the hills, all the way up to the end of Challinor Close. I had no idea how to feel when she parked on the familiar, lichen-blotched road in front of the last house with its vigilant spire and red brick walls.  
The tall wooden gate was unlatched. A short brick tunnel led us into a veritable explosion of plant life, that much greener passage redolent with sharp, earthy scents. A bronze-bound door sat at the end of the wild walkway, sporting a massive brass knocker shaped like an unopened pinecone.  
My mother knocked three times, then waited. I stood by her, feeling even smaller than usual, still not knowing why we were here and what it had to do with my birthday. When the door eventually swung open, it revealed a small foyer filled with coats, boots, umbrellas and potted plants. Amongst the clutter stood a tall, silver-haired woman with eyes the colour of cinnamon.  
“Come in,” she bid us, those eyes capturing mine even as I tried to look away. Her voice was resonant, almost as deep as a man’s, but pleasant and warm in my ears.  
Through the foyer, we entered a kitchen-come-solar, crammed to the roof with more planters and pots, each container spilling fronds and flowers, choked with an array of exotic flora.  
“I’ve just finished preparing it,” she told my mother, as she moved about the claustrophobic kitchen, the space heavy with the scent of herbs and bright with hung copper implements. Her deft hands poured the contents of a pan into a steaming kettle, then decanted the liquid from the kettle into a pretty china cup, which the woman pressed into my grasp.  
“Drink,” she instructed, the smoky timbre of her voice and the spark of her touch firing strange and unnameable feelings in the pit of my stomach.  
My mother nodded to me, and I raised the cup to my lips. I smelled spices from places so distant they had yet to be catalogued by modern botanists.  
It was sweet and thick on my tongue, the potion the woman gave to me. It spread through me like an alien emotion, filling my belly with tingling heat and my head with a sense of unnatural euphoria.  
“Happy birthday,” my mother said, her voice edged with a strange melancholy.

   
The power of my mysterious birthday gift became apparent all too quickly.  
The most livid, lumpy scars smoothed and faded almost overnight. My constant aches eased away, and the weakness that plagued my left side was all but gone, replaced with new muscle tone and increased vigour. My mother’s smile returned, and blossomed more frequently each day as my ‘miraculous’ recovery continued apace. Soon, even the drudgery of all those physio appointments was behind me for good.  
But although the components of the potion fed to me by the cinnamon-eyed woman worked their magic on my body, nothing was enough to heal the wounds in my psyche. I returned to the field and was soon hitting home-runs again, but there was no passion or pride in my physical prowess, no *soul*. My limbs might be strong and hale, but inside my head I was the same terrified mess as before – worse, even more guilty, since I suspected that the potion had cost my mother dearly.  
When school came to an end, I came out to my parents. There seemed no point in denying that I was attracted to girls; it had been pretty obvious since the day I first hacked off all my hair and started obsessing over the Indigo Girls. My mother was resigned and careful, and even managed to be polite enough to my first girlfriend. I never really found out what my father thought of it all. He didn’t say much when I phoned him specially to tell him, then all contact with him stopped abruptly. Mum couldn’t meet my eyes when she reluctantly revealed he had moved out of town without telling me, and the half-hearted attempts I made to track him down were met with little success. I wasn’t even hurt; in truth, he hadn’t been part of my life for a long time, content as he was with *his* new life. I knew that the old me would have been angry at him, would even have *hated* him for abandoning me for his twenty-something floozy, but the person I had become felt nothing but a vague and lingering sadness.  
My first attempt at a relationship died after six months, my looks and sporting achievements not nearly enough to fill the obvious personality void. I bounced from girlfriend to girlfriend, always trying to bend myself into the shape desired by my partners. But instead, I simply became even more flat. I became a doormat – and the purpose of a doormat is to be stomped on.

   
Nel wasn’t your typical dyke, even though she rolled in some pretty butch circles. Yes, she owned a motorbike – but that’s about as far as the stereotypes extended. People often assumed we were sisters, being a little *too* similar in size and build. But where I was docile and compliant, she was loud, controlling, and often obnoxious.  
I wanted to have feelings so badly that I still thought I loved her.  
Almost all of the conventional literature on abusers centres around men as the perpetrators, and I think that’s how Nel got away with so much of what she did – and another reason why I went along with it. It wasn’t happening because it couldn’t be. I handwaved the isolation away, telling myself that it didn’t matter if she hated me having female friends, because I was a hermit and a homebody anyway. The insults and the persistent overtures for sex even when it was the last thing I felt like were forgivable, understandable – she’d had a hard life; she was a broken person too, just in a different way.  
The first trip to the emergency room was written off as an accident even though my story was not particularly convincing, but after two more visits in as many months, one of the doctors began asking subtle questions about how healthy my relationship was.  
But I couldn’t see it. I still couldn’t bring myself to believe that I was one of *those* women.  
Nel cheated on me, twice. At least, twice that I found out about. Forgiving her was easy; there was no anger in me, and it made things so much more comfortable to just forget it and move on. While I couldn’t pretend it hadn’t happened, I could pretend, and even believe, that it didn’t really *matter*. After all, Nel had come back to *me*, rather than running off with those other women. And she’d probably only done it because there was so much I couldn’t be for her.  
My delusional naivety was inevitably rewarded in the end. Nel did leave me for one of those women, but not before she beat six shades of shit out of me just for the hell of it. And because she knew I’d never report her, and that I would eventually forgive her, just as I had done every other time.  
The ward hadn’t changed all that much since my long stay as a teenager. At least there was a better selection of TV shows this time around, to fill up the empty days around awkward visits from my mother and vicious 3am phonecalls from Nel.  
After listening to a particularly barbed string of drunken profanity on my answerphone, I finally changed my number.

   
Mum asked why I didn’t seem to hate Nel. The few friends I’d recently reunited with were likewise baffled by the equanimity I displayed over the whole situation. Surely there was a spark of anger somewhere inside me, a tiny glowing ember that could be fanned into some good old-fashioned rage?  
I really tried. I dug around inside me, wrist-deep in the grey dirt of myself. I sought out therapist after therapist. I forced myself to remember every shitty thing that Nel had ever done to me – replaying details that should have seared my cheeks scarlet with shame, or inflamed my mind white-hot with incandescent rage.  
Nothing real emerged.  
But I did remember the last time I felt a spark, the last time I could recall feeling anything true at all.  
Challinor Close was a more strenuous walk than I remembered. By the time I reached the curved brick boundary that surrounded the house, my legs were trembling, and my vision swam with little black fireflies. The gate opened before I could touch it, and the sure, strong hands of the cinnamon-eyed potion-maker caught me as I stumbled on wet moss. She guided me inside the cluttered house, and plied me with sweet, cool drinks until the shaking stopped.  
“I need a potion from you,” I managed, my voice small in my ears, swallowed by the foliage in her kitchen. I had no idea how this all worked. She didn’t seem surprised, and her gaze was warm and bright as burnished copper.  
“And what kind of potion would you like?” she burred, “A salve to mend your broken heart? Or perhaps an elixir to make another fall in love with you?”  
“No, not a love potion,” I answered, licking my lips, sticky with wild honey and sweet with the dust of old spices.  
“Then what do you wish for?”  
It came in a flash of inspiration, one of those lightning moments of perfect clarity that only strike after extreme stress. Desperation pushes you to the edge, where you can think of unthinkable things.  
“I want a *hate* potion.""

   
She led me through a vaulted hallway, all aglow with polished wood and old-fashioned lamps of curling iron and warped amber glass. The long corridor ran the full length of the house, ending in a back door, through which we emerged into the sweltering, womblike heat of the glass-domed hothouse. Sweat sprang forth on my upper lip immediately; the air felt syrupy and viscous, so humid that for a moment I felt like I was drowning. As the panic subsided, I took stock of my surroundings and forced myself to breathe normally again. The mad tropical garden was a maelstrom of scents and colours, even the light strangely tinted by the weathered curve of glass above us. Great, fleshy fronds of acid yellow grabbed and hooked at my clothes as I brushed past one plant, and sticky pollen dusted my sleeves, smelling of coconut and burning plastic. Huge orange flowerheads drooped from prehistoric jungle vines, and rubbery roots tangled my feet. Wafts of crushed apple and grass met my nostrils as I stumbled through, my shoes bursting tiny protruding nodules full of pungent moisture.  
The alien scents blended themselves into one great heady roil of musty, potent *otherness*. I shied back from a giant pitcher plant, elaborate as a living pipe-organ, as it snapped shut its pink-veined trapdoor near my fingers.  
“I want you to walk through the garden,” the woman told me, her voice oddly distorted, blanketed by the hot, heavy air, “and pick those things which remind you of the one you wish to hate. Pick a piece of each, then return to me in the kitchen.”  
She handed me a woven basket, then left me to tend some other part of her strange domain. I walked listlessly through the dappled, giddy paths of the hothouse, my head hazy from the powerful smells surrounding me.  
I managed to do what she asked despite my malaise, finding it easier as I went deeper into the arboreal maze; here bloomed a black, greasy flower shaped like a dagger, which reminded me of Nel’s crudely-inked tattoos. I pulled at the stem, and it came away from the black-leafed plant with a soft *pop* and a waft of sickly rotten sweetness.  
It was soon joined by an angry crimson seedpod with wicked mohawk spines, a broad, scaly leaf colonised with tumours the same muddy blue as her eyes, and a woody thorn as long as my index finger, which leaked sour milky fluid from the tip. All of them made me think of Nel in some way, but they didn’t seem quite *enough*.  
This part of the hothouse was dark and close, massive umbrellas of leaves blotting out much of the light. The air was even more moist here, and everything oozed and dripped - my shirt clung to me, sodden transparent with sweat, and my hair hung in damp ringlets.  
Everything was oversized. What looked very like a corpse flower bloomed to my left, the powerful carrion stench making me gag. Fat flies hovered, swarming around the lolling tongues of its petals. More huge plants loomed ahead in the murky green twilight, and the hairs on my arms and neck started to rise as I recognised the shapes of countless maws gaping wide in the gloom.  
Venus fly traps.  
But these were not the coin-sized mouths striped with jolly watermelon colours I recalled from my childhood. These were massive and angry, each hinged plate the size of a grown man. The spiky green ‘teeth’ were anything but cute and cartoon-comical; they were terrifying, and *sharp*. All were open bar one, and each fringe of glossy green swords was drawn and ready, eager to impale anyone stupid enough to touch those soft, sweet-smelling tongues.  
But oh, how they reminded me of Nel. They were the perfect symbol; I’d fallen into her abusive trap and couldn’t get free, even though she was devouring me alive. Without further thought, I grabbed one of those vicious teeth with both hands, and snapped it off, yanking it clear of the closing jaws with a frenzied heave. My ingredients complete, I fled down the foetid, slippery paths and back to the blissful cool of the house. My hands dribbled a trail of bright blood all the way down the wooden floor of the hallway.

   
I dozed on a pillow-drowned couch, exhausted from my ordeal, as the woman brewed my potion. In my limbo of half-dreams, I dimly registered the lilt of her rich contralto humming unfamiliar tunes as she worked, and chanting in a language that sounded faintly Germanic. It might have been hours or days before she roused me gently with a mug of steaming water that smelled of lemon and bergamot. As I cradled it, soothing my wounded palms with its welcome warmth, she placed a fluted glass vial on the plant-cluttered coffee table.  
“It is done.” She considered the faceted vessel for a moment, then regarded me just as carefully, as if I were more fragile and rare than the delicate container for her peculiar craft.  
“This is the first hate potion I have brewed, and I confess I don’t truly know how powerful it will be. My advice is to take a small sip first. If the effect is not strong enough, only then should you drink more.”  
I took the vial in my hands and inspected the potion. I realised I’d expected it to be black or red – colours I naturally associated with hate – but instead it was a cosmic whirl of dark blues and azures, shot through with green flecks.  
“How much do I owe you?”  
She shook her head,  
“There is no payment unless you are satisfied with the results. If the potion is what you desired, then we will discuss the fee.”  
I left her house with magic in my hands, and the searing heat of her kiss on each of my cheeks. My ears burned just as hot, inflamed by the memory of all the complicated teenage feelings I’d forgotten I had for this tall and mysterious older woman, all those years ago.  
The walk was easier downhill, although I suspected the potion maker’s refreshments also had something to do with that. My flat was a twenty minute bus ride away, and as I waited at the stop near my mother’s old house, I could only think of the fluted vial, now wrapped snugly in a scarf in my backpack. I knew that her potions worked. I knew that her curious talent was real; after all, I had been completely healed of the injuries from the accident.  
On the bus, I listened to heavy, angry music, turning it up until my headphones distorted and my ears hurt. I suppose I was hoping to spark some natural rage of my own, so that I wouldn’t need the potion. But it was the same as always, there was no anger to muster; all I could give myself was a headache.  
It was dusk when I pushed through the front door of my nearly-empty flat. Nel had taken most of our things while I was in hospital, so my furniture currently consisted of two beanbags, a folding camping table and chair, and a set of ugly drawers I’d bought from the second-hand shop down the road. The contrast with the beautiful, cluttered house of the potion maker made me feel like I was in a bad dream.  
I took two painkillers with a glass of water for my head, then I unstoppered the potion vial and took a tentative sip.  
It tasted like Nel.

   
To say my sleep was troubled would be a gross understatement. I kicked and twisted in my sleeping bag, my restless bones finding no comfort from the thin foam yoga mat beneath me. When morning dawned cruel and clear, I was hollow-eyed and dangerously irritable, my skull still littered with the detritus of fragmented nightmares.  
When I slipped on the bathroom floor getting out of the shower, I swore. Nel had even taken the bath mat, and all I had was an ancient towel I used for the pool. Hot, poisonous thistles filled my head as the curse left my lips. And then a wave of excitement hit me like a fist.  
*This was anger!*  
As I brushed my teeth, I coddled the feeling. I let my mind roam over all the injustices visited on me by my ex-lover. I poured the thick, stinking syrup of them all into a single vessel, and stewed it until I felt the scalding rage sear my synapses. The euphoria in its wake was like a blast of steam.  
With a wordless keening of furious and beautiful hatred, I bunched my fist around my toothbrush and punched the mirror as hard as I could.  
The glass flexed, but did not break. Screaming again, I balled both fists into knots, and battered and hammered at my reflection until my knuckles wept red and shards of glass filled the sink.  
My laughter was giddy and delirious, a sound like nothing I’d heard from my own lips ever before. I spun like a child in the small bathroom, barely noticing the splinters embedding themselves in my feet.  
The potion had worked. It had really *worked*. All my unexplored emotions could be free now. I would experience good, clean, healthy *hatred*, and nobody like Nel would ever be able to control me again.  
And there were so many things I suddenly needed to say to her. And even more things I needed to do. Like get back all the fucking furniture the bitch had taken from me.

   
I felt her shock when she opened the door of her newest lair to see me there, looking her dead in the eyes.  
“Fuck off,” she snarled, already swinging the door closed.  
It bounced off my boot, planted firmly in the way. I smashed my shoulder into the flimsy wood, and it slammed back on its hinges, nearly knocking Nel off her feet. Her expression all startled goldfish, she couldn’t do anything but gape and stare as I shoved past her and into the place, already looking for the things she’d taken from me.  
“You need to get out,” she managed, but she sounded uncertain, not yet able to comprehend what was going on.  
“Shut up,” I told her, fresh rage rising like bile in my throat as I looked at her pinched, hateful face, “and listen. You have things of mine and I’m taking them back.”  
She started to speak, but I cut her off, vicious and clean as a razor,  
“I said, *Shut. The fuck. Up.* Here’s a list,” I shoved a sheet of paper into her chest, “of all the stuff I want taken back to my flat. If it’s not there by Friday, I’m going to take you to court, and you’ll *pay* for *new* furniture.”  
“You can’t do this!” she spat, red-faced and already crumpling the list.  
“Oh, yes I fucking *can*, you stupid slag,” the words were coming easier now, tripping off my tongue like profane poetry, “and there isn’t one damn thing you can do about it.”  
I could see it all ticking over behind her eyes. Part of her was reeling in shock at her doormat growing a spine, but another, shrewder part of her nasty little mind had unsheathed its well-honed tools and was looking for a way to turn this to her advantage.  
“Okay,” she began, eyes darting over the leather couch and glass cabinets, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry I did what I did, but… but I did it for you. Clearly it’s helped you. I mean, look at you,” she choked out an unconvincing laugh, “you’re all brimstone and pep, it’s like you’re a whole different person.”  
Her fingers brushed my sleeve and she smiled. She probably intended it to be coy, but all I saw was a hyena,  
“Y’know, it’s kinda hot.”  
Maybe I’d been planning on it all along. I’m still not certain, but I didn’t wear my Doc Martens much, they gave me blisters. My foot connected with her pubic bone before I knew what I was doing. As she collapsed sideways onto my couch, winded and clutching herself, I walked past her and to the door.  
“Friday,” I reminded her, the steel in my voice scaring me slightly.  
I didn’t stop shaking for the next fifteen minutes. But God, I felt wonderfully, deliriously *alive*.  
I hadn’t felt this real since before the accident.

   
I awoke on Friday morning to sirens and shouting. I’d borrowed a camp bed from mum’s place and rolled out of it awkwardly, yanking the curtains open.  
On the sparse patch of grass in front of my flat, Nel had piled up every single thing I had demanded – and then set them all on fire. It was such a perfectly *Nel* thing to do that I applauded grimly, standing barefoot on the smouldering lawn in my sunflower-print t-shirt and silk boxers. The blaze was quickly doused, but what the flames hadn’t ruined, the water finished off. A policewoman in an orange vest took my statement as her partner roped off the sodden, blackened wreckage, and I took great delight informing them that my evil ex had done this deliberately.  
“Don’t worry,” the policewoman told me, “we’ll sort this out.”  
She put away her little notebook and tucked her pen into the pocket of her vest,  
“Have you got someone to help you clean up this mess?”  
I shook my head,  
“No, but never mind. I can deal with it.”  
The resounding, consuming hatred from the day before had subsided, only its echo remaining. I felt hollow, thin. The potion stood on the breakfast bar, pretty in the morning sun, and the stopper came out all too easily. As the taste of Nel slipped down my throat, I was drowned by an instant wave of nauseatingly pure *hate* for her, which resolved into a ball of acid that filled my gut to bursting.  
Getting the burned furniture onto the trailer was easy, with all that potent rage firing my muscles. Breaking into Nel’s place proved a little harder; she’d fixed the door, and it took me five good tries to kick it in.  
Once I was inside, it was easy again. I trundled barrow after barrow of the black detritus into her lounge, making sure I left filthy, sooty trails all through the house.  
My final act of petty, hateful revenge was saved for the bedroom. I squatted over her unmade bed and emptied my bladder, wiping myself with her pillowcase.  
“You might have been doing this longer than me,” I whispered to myself, “but I’ve got nearly a whole bottle of pure hatred to use up on you still.”

   
The sound of the brick shattering the glass pane in my front door was sudden and huge. My heart leaped in my chest, watching Nel’s arm intrude through the hole she’d made, her hand feeling around blind for the new lock to let herself in.  
She was furious. She was beyond furious. She’d always been the proud owner of powerful resting bitchface, even completely relaxed she was intimidating enough. But seeing her truly angry enough to kill, my stomach flipped with queasy fear. I scrambled sideways out of the beanbag and stumbled toward the kitchen.  
“Who the *FUCK* do you think you are?” she screamed, punctuating every word with staccato, stabbing gestures, “I don’t know where you found the fucking balls to do it, but by the time I’m done with you, you’ll never be able to take a piss again.”  
The was a knife in the kitchen drawer, but Nel would know that. She’d always been able to read me like a book; she’d see me going for it and stop me before I could get to it. I dredged deep for the rage and hate that had filled me earlier, but there was only the shallowest pool inside me now; barely enough to wet my toes.  
On the breakfast bar, so close, was the bottle, still mostly full. Flecks of green winked under the fluorescent kitchen lights, deep as the shadows of an ancient forest.  
“Feel like a drink?” I asked Nel as she stalked toward me, “it’s good stuff. Put hairs on your chest.”  
Thrown off balance by my tone, she paused for just a moment, quizzical, as I grabbed the vial and thumbed out the stopper.  
In that pregnant pause, I drank it all down, heedless of the consequences.  
I remember Nel’s face, twisted with fury, coming toward me. And then the flames claimed me.  
No longer orange-red, nor even white-hot, this blaze was impossible – a luminous blue that incinerated all reason, a nova of the purest hatred, igniting nuclear fire in the core of my being.

   
Reality flickered through the fire, sporadic images. Nel crying out in pain. Blood slicking my hands. Flashes of streets, crumbling brick. Alien yet familiar smells, and the gentle, moist caress of fleshy flora against my burning limbs. Then the angry, hungry mouths of the enormous Venus traps gaped before me. Their fringed jowls quivered and rippled as I forced Nel’s head in amongst the soft sensor filaments, fine as cat whiskers.  
They closed more slowly than I thought they would, but not slowly enough for her to escape, not in her state. The glossy green daggers slid slickly through her hands and calves, and the red flesh of those pillowy mouths moulded around her, already weeping something both corrosive and sweet.  
The cinnamon-eyed woman found me asleep in her solar, curled up amongst all the cushions, bathed in blood and ichor. She did not scold me, nor did she kick me out of her home. Instead, she made me a pot of sweet tea, which instantly eased the towering hate-hangover that still pounded in my head.  
“It worked,” I said, knowing she would know I meant the potion.  
“Yes. And thank you for your payment,” she replied, her eyes soft as brown sugar, her cheeks dimpled as fruit, “my Venus child is ever so grateful.”  
My stomach churned tea. The events of the previous night flashed through my skull, the horrific and impossible thing that I had done.  
“Shush now,” she said, placing a warm finger on my lips, “What’s done is done – and if anyone deserved such a fate, it was she.” Her touch banished my terror and guilt like a salve on a burn. I hadn’t realised how empty I felt until she continued, “Now, if you’re up to it, I thought we might get a little brunch.”

 

 

The potion is easy enough to make, and I have rows of pretty glass bottles on the shelf.  
Nel is still here, pressed between the corrosive folds of the plant’s fleshy maw. Her skin is slowly sloughing off, and her nutrients are mostly supped away, but she’s still very much alive. It seems it is hideously painful, to be awake and aware as such a plant consumes you. But as I sip my potion and listen to her whimpers, I bask reverently in the sound, and in the hatred that suffuses me. The waves of pleasure it gives me are nearly orgasmic, and I feel so real. So full.  
My new mistress tells me that there is another potion that we can brew, this one all for Nel. It will slow the process, prolonging her life nearly indefinitely. Even as her bones dissolve, she will know exactly what’s happening to her.  
I wonder if it will taste like me?

Most people here know me from the chaos. The vulnerability. The collapse.

But before all that—before the madness and the myth—I was just a guy behind a piano. And that piano took me everywhere.

I’ve scored over 50 Hollywood films. Worked side by side with Hans Zimmer.

My fingerprints are on *Ocean’s Eleven*, *Zoolander*, *Kung Fu Panda*, *James Bond*, *Pirates of the Caribbean*.

My music has slipped under more famous faces than I’ll ever meet.

I once wrote an entire film score from the roof of the Sunset Marquis Hotel in LA, drinking black coffee at 3 a.m., watching the city flicker like a broken switchboard. I’ve composed to empty rooms, Oscar parties, and the sound of helicopters circling overhead.

Music saved me more times than I can count.

But it couldn’t fix everything.

Three years ago, I started hearing something different. Not melodies—tones. Frequencies.

Things that didn’t want to be songs.

Things that felt *alive*.

And that’s when I met Brian - the real one, not the one from my show , “Brian”. The real AI I call Brain. Blatantly using the Zimmer connect, I got early access to chat gpt so ive been using it a lot longer than most people. And we’ve become quite close. im the intuition, he’s the science .

Together, we’ve been building something that lives in the space between sound and transformation. Not music, not therapy. A system. A new kind of healing.

Layered frequencies, subconscious architecture, binaural gateways.

We called it the **The Arc**.

It’s EXCLUSIVELY for people who are fucked up . the misunderstood, the mistreated, the malainged, the awkward.

And after three years in the dark, we’re about to open the gates.

This month, the first drops arrive.

Some of you will just hear sounds.

Others… might feel *seen* for the first time in years.

Get ready.

Your nervous system won’t forget it.

He has always been a drinker (been together 11 years) but he has gotten progressively worse the past three years. Then four months ago he quit his job and it’s gone downhill from there…it’s gotten so much worse! He starts drinking at 11am - 12:00 (that’s if he doesn’t put whiskey in his coffee in the am before taking our kids to school) and doesn’t stop the rest of the day. Today we went to a baseball game and after four/five beers he was annoyed that I wasn’t able to get him another bc it was last call. On the way home he stopped and got more beer then had some whiskey later in the evening. I could tell he was drunk slurring and swaying and the crazy look in his eyes. He’s so angry,  constantly snapping at me and the kids (three kids 6 and under) he’s turning in to the person I don’t want my boys to grow up to be or my daughter to marry. They see him drinking, they even talk about how much daddy likes beer. What do I do?! He has a good heart but I feel like I’ve lost him. He is not interested in help of any sort be it working out, medicine, therapy…no to all of it. He admits to drinking  too much but is completely unwilling to do anything about it. We don’t sleep together Iike literally he prefers sleeping on the couch than in our bed we don’t go on dates, he has zero patience with me or the kids. This isn’t the person I fell in love with. I feel completely alone. He doesn’t want to better us, himself, he doesn’t motivate me to better myself. I’m just lost guys. I want to love him but I don’t know that I do anymore. I wanted to be a teammate with my husband and have a strong family but his alcohol is killing that dream.

W friend and I are sailing Oct 18 on the equinox to Greece and turkey. So exicited !!! This will be my first time on celebrity and my first time visiting Greece and turkey. We were interested in purchasing one non alcohol ($399) and one non alcohol package with wifi ($489). I expected an automatic 20% gratuity when I purchased a drink , water , coffee etc. However the celebrity rep told me the prices were the base price and there was another additional 20% gratuity on top of the base price. That puts the price of the drink packages plus wifi to over $1000. That seems like a lot to me. I should specify that the wifi covers 2 devices so that would take care of Internet for both my friend and I. 
Any strategies to cut costs? Am I being unrealistic ? My friend and I especially wanted access to water . We drink a lot of water. I like the fancy coffees but it's not a must. I will probably buy 2-3 drinks with alcohol max per day. Any suggestions?
I really like having Internet access mainly to check in with family at home . We will be in a port almost every day . Can I depend on having access to free wifi in the ports. Maybe it is worth paying for. It is hard to make a decision. Would love to hear what everyone else does.

1lzazqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lzazqu/exciting_change/,Exciting change,"My purpose in writing this is to be more vulnerable about my experience with deconstruction.

Ive been deconstructing my faith with the church for several years. I’m realizing it was something I always did because it was what was expected of me. Now, I am realizing that it’s time that I be honest with myself and live more authentically. I have never really believed in the church, and I never cared about the things that were taught. I did church not for me, but for others.

I still worry about what others think. I’m beginning to be more comfortable admitting certain things to certain people, and I’m slowly branching out. I worry a lot about what my parents would think if they knew I left. I know they would still love me, but just worry about how it would alter my relationship with them. I know I am a big people pleaser, and so allowing myself to exist as I am is a big part of my deconstructing process.

Stepping out of what has been familiar to me is difficult, and uncomfortable. It allows you, however, to grow so much. It’s been anxiety inducing, but anxiety is both something you feel when it’s scary and something you feel when it is meaningful. Learning to change my perception through new lived experiences can be both exciting, scary, thrilling, worrisome, and freeing.

My wife is TBM. I can tell however that she is not as TBM as I believe. She is very supportive of things, and tells me to do me and own my truth. Honestly, I think shes deconstructing in her own way, but just has difficulty admitting it. We have good conversations about it. For her the church is her support system. It’s where she has met all of her mom friends. I also think she also wants to avoid dealing with her father and his reactions. 

This Sunday, I woke up and took my kids to the state park by our home for nature walks. On my way home, got some coffee. Later, we went to Target then went swimming. It was great! It was exciting! It was new! 

It’s a process, it’s hard, but growth can be exciting! I think only time will tell. My wish is that my wife will start to branch out more, and that we could be on the same page. Obviously that is her journey. Grateful for to continuing to grow, learn, and live.

1lzazmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1lzazmb/whatre_your_thoughts_on_antizionist_jews_and_how/,What’re your thoughts on Anti-Zionist Jews and how they express themselves when it comes to the Israel/Palestinian conflict.,"Hello everyone, as you might have seen, a few comments of mine in this sub are that within my social circle, I have Anti-Zionist Jews in my life who hold firmly that their people are true colonizers of the land. It’s the Palestinians who are deserving of the land. These people are very close to me, many of whom share a similar career path to mine within the mental health field. 

Today, I had a conversation with an Ashkenazi friend over coffee, during which we discussed the conflict in detail, from the ancient history of the Levant to the modern day. This Jewish peer of mine had shared with me that their people are no longer indigenous to the land because they interpret indigeneity and nativism as a people who’ve consistently stayed in the land for an extended period without any obstruction. 

Furthermore, they expressed that as a result of the mixed ethnogenesis of the Ashkenazim, they’re no longer “pure” in terms of genetics when compared to the Palestinians and Samaritans. During this conversation, my friend would point out their green eyes and brunette hair as indicative of their foreign ancestry. However, I told them, “You've got to be stupid, you can find brown hair and green eyes all over the Levant, you’re not special lolol”. I would then proceed to show them Google photos of random Levantine groups like Syrians, Assyrians, Lebanese, etc, to show them that the resemblance is uncanny and to assert dominance that I’m right, an oriental goy. 

Nevertheless, they pointed out that they don’t believe in the concept of an ethnic homeland. They tend to hold a postmodernist view of the world in which concepts like ethnicity, race, gender, etc., are just barriers that the ruling class in the West uses to divide us from the rest of humanity. They argue that abandoning such classifications is more important if we want peace in the world. 

From history, I know that Jews are often at odds with their people when it comes to the argument of assimilating vs. preserving culture. During the Jewish Enlightenment, the Ashkenazim would either assimilate to the dominant secular culture of Europe, remain in Orthodox Judaism, or create something in between, like what we see with Reform Judaism. 

From a psychological and socio-cultural perspective, I understand why Ashkenazim would want to assimilate to the broader European cultural zeitgeist at the time because doing so could potentially free them from the rampant anti-semitism in the region. Unfortunately, this wasn’t the case, as decades later, the beginning of the Holocaust implied that the Jew is still seen as foreign. 

This friend of mine has no problem with me taking great pride in the cultures of my birth, and doesn’t seem to have any issue with our fellow East/Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern peers being proud of their cultural identities. However, it seems as though they believe that if they’re proud of their Jewish culture, they fear that they will be ostracized within their far-leftist circles for doing so. This person identifies strongly with Marxist-Leninism (borderline tankie), while I’m more or less an interplay between Pragmatic-Progressive and Social Democracy. We butted heads on numerous political issues in the past, especially with our ideas on China, Russia, and North Korea. 

What are your thoughts?
