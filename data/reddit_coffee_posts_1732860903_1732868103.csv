I’m someone who likes to keep things simple and minimal. But honestly, shopping these days feels way too complicated.
Whenever I go on Amazon or any store and search for something simple—like coffee mug—there are hundreds of brands to choose from. Okay, fine, variety is nice. I check a few, pick one that seems like good value for money, and move on. But when I search for something else—like storage boxes or clothes hangers—the same thing happens all over again: hundreds of options, different brands, and now I have to spend more time comparing to figure out which one is worth it.
And even after all that effort, I might end up with something that isn’t great quality or doesn’t feel worth the price.
Sometimes I wish there was just one brand (or at least fewer) for day-to-day products. A brand that I can trust for good quality and value for money, without wasting time comparing so much.

Obviously, I did what I had to do to track down a copy. In the early 2000's that took some doing, but I managed to find a poor-quality version rendered from someone's home recording. It was brilliant.

It sets you up as one of those semi-boring shows where they tell a bunch of ghost stories, show you supposedly haunted objects that don't do anything, and maybe someone goes ""did you hear that?"". And you accept it on that level, settle in... and then things go very wrong.

And then things reach out through the camera.

[Ghostwatch (1992)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200659) summary:

>In a ""live"" broadcast on Halloween night, a BBC team investigate a reported poltergeist in an ordinary London home.

We watch Michael Parkinson, Sarah Greene, Mike Smith, and Craig Charles, all being themselves in studio and in an actual council house doing what starts off as a standard ghost investigation. Early on you can catch a glimpse or two of the ghost, but when they look back or replay the same footage, it's gone. Did you really see anything?

And then the callers start saying they saw what you did, and a few things you didn't. So you lean in, scanning every shadow and reflection for a sign of the supernatural. You hear things. It's revealed through interviews and call-ins that some very dark things happened in that house. You spot that figure again. There are technical difficulties. People start calling in with odd behavior from their pets and loved ones.

The action escalates, the pace is broken up, sometimes you're lulled into a false sense of security only to be drawn right back into the drama. It keeps you on your toes, and has a beautiful ending that lets you know even the people watching at home aren't safe.

**Should you watch it?** Definitely. This is maybe my 5th time seeing it over the years and it hasn't lost a single bit of shine on it. It's a masterclass in pacing, has some great scares, and feels very real.

I've carefully avoided spoilers at the risk of leaving this review a bit sparse, so I'll just say this: don't miss this classic.

First question, I can't seem to find a way to delete a room? [This weird offshoot is outside my house.](https://i.imgur.com/ySCXbit.jpeg) or will it eventually figure out that's not a room and delete it from the map itself?

I kept my kids room closed, so it doesn't register as a room at all on the map now. Will I have to make sure the door is closed everytime or will it just ignore it completely now? I assume I can add it to the map eventually (once the floor is all picked up) and use routines to specifically just do that room, or include it or not when I do the whole house. 

My biggest thing was letting it do the big vacuuming and mopping for me at least every other week so I could focus on other cleaning tasks or maybe even just relax once in awhile.  I'm unsure how to go about mapping this initially since it involves me moving rugs, our coffee tables, dining room chairs, litter box etc. So was wondering if anyone had any suggestions. (I technically could be absolutely crazy and move all this stuff up on counters and couches once to let it do it that way then divide the rooms up after the fact and have it go room by room)

Also any other suggestions or tips or tricks I'm totally here for! I've been browsing and googling. 

Absolutely in love with this thing already. I'm amazed at how quiet it is, almost wish it was a little louder cause our slightly bolder cat who is still terrified of the vacuum kept messing with it.

**1. Preventive and scheduled maintenance/servicing**

Extruder gears, axis wheels, hotend, noozle, print bed, belts, servo motors, what else?

Would it make sense to track working hours to plan when each part needs to be replaced or lubricated?

**2. Material-dedicated machine settings.** 

Pressure advance, input shape, acceleration, what else?

**3. Material dedicated parameters.** 

Temperature, bed temperature, flow rate, printing speed, travel speed, infill, layer height, line width, cooling, what else?



I mostly print PLA and PETG, and it happens often that the nozzle hits an already-printed filament when traveling. I noticed the filament seems to be raised after it's laid down in some areas, but I can't figure out why (see picture). The other picture is my setup with an eSUN filament dryer.

Is there a good guide/manual to be used as a source of truth of all possible issues and solutions that could happen when 3D printing?

Pregnancy is a transformative journey, but it can come with its fair share of discomforts—headaches being one of the most common. For many expecting individuals, headaches may feel like an added burden to the already demanding process of growing a new life. Understanding why they occur, how to manage them, and when to seek help can make a world of difference.

# Why Do Headaches Happen During Pregnancy?

Headaches during pregnancy can range from mild to severe and are caused by a variety of factors. Let’s break it down:

# 1. Hormonal Changes

Hormones like estrogen and progesterone surge during pregnancy. While these are essential for your baby’s development, they can affect your brain’s blood vessels and trigger headaches.

# 2. Increased Blood Volume

Your body produces about 50% more blood during pregnancy to support your baby. This increased circulation can lead to vascular changes, sometimes causing headaches.

# 3. Stress and Fatigue

The physical and emotional demands of pregnancy can be overwhelming. Lack of sleep, added stress, and fatigue are all common triggers for tension headaches.

# 4. Dehydration

Pregnancy increases your body’s need for fluids. If you’re not drinking enough water, dehydration can easily result in headaches.

# 5. Caffeine Withdrawal

If you’ve reduced or eliminated your coffee intake for your baby’s health, withdrawal symptoms might manifest as headaches, especially early in pregnancy.

# 6. Sinus Congestion

Hormonal changes can cause nasal swelling, leading to sinus pressure and sinus headaches.

# 7. Low Blood Sugar

Nausea or inconsistent eating patterns might cause dips in blood sugar, another potential trigger for headaches.

# 8. Poor Posture

As your belly grows, your posture adjusts to the extra weight. This can strain your back, neck, and shoulders, often leading to tension headaches.

# 9. Underlying Conditions

In rare cases, headaches can indicate more serious health issues, such as high blood pressure or preeclampsia. We’ll discuss this in detail later.

# How to Treat Pregnancy Headaches

https://preview.redd.it/a9xkz9k1os3e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ba86e8db86c7093653dbfd57a518582820a49f

Managing headaches safely during pregnancy requires a combination of natural remedies and, if necessary, medical treatments. Here’s how you can find relief:

# 1. Safe Medications

* **Acetaminophen (Tylenol):** Generally considered safe for occasional use. Always follow your doctor’s recommendations.
* **Avoid Ibuprofen and Aspirin:** These are typically not advised during pregnancy unless prescribed.

# 2. Stay Hydrated

Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily. If you’re struggling with plain water, try adding lemon or cucumber slices for flavor.

# 3. Rest and Relax

Find a quiet, dark room to lie down and close your eyes. Reducing sensory input can alleviate tension or migraine headaches.

# 4. Use Compresses

* For tension headaches: Apply a warm compress to your neck and shoulders to relieve muscle tightness.
* For migraines: Place a cold compress or ice pack on your forehead.

# 5. Massage

A gentle head, neck, and shoulder massage can do wonders for relieving tension headaches. Partner massages or professional prenatal massages are great options.

# 6. Acupressure

Applying gentle pressure to specific points, like the base of your skull or the webbing between your thumb and index finger, may provide relief.

# 7. Sleep and Posture Adjustments

Use a pregnancy pillow to improve your sleeping position and support your back. Correct posture during daily activities can also help prevent headaches.

# Coping with Headaches: Everyday Strategies

https://preview.redd.it/6sp49740os3e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0915a4f33019f38b045e56585c4c294cf00f0fa0

Headaches can be disruptive, but adopting certain habits can reduce their frequency and intensity:

# 1. Maintain a Consistent Routine

Stick to regular sleep, meal, and hydration schedules. Your body thrives on predictability, especially during pregnancy.

# 2. Identify Triggers

Keep a headache journal to track potential triggers like specific foods, strong smells, bright lights, or stress.

# 3. Eat Small, Frequent Meals

Prevent blood sugar dips by snacking on healthy options like nuts, fruit, or yogurt every few hours.

# 4. Practice Relaxation Techniques

Stress management is key. Consider:

* Prenatal yoga
* Meditation or mindfulness exercises
* Deep breathing techniques

# 5. Gentle Exercise

Light activities such as walking or swimming can improve blood circulation and help reduce tension.

# 6. Limit Screen Time

Staring at a screen for long periods can lead to eyestrain. Take regular breaks and adjust lighting to reduce glare.

# When Are Headaches During Pregnancy Serious?

While most pregnancy headaches are benign, some may signal an underlying issue that needs medical attention. Here’s when to reach out to your doctor:

# 1. Severe or Persistent Pain

If your headache doesn’t improve with rest or acetaminophen, it’s time to consult your healthcare provider.

# 2. Visual Changes

Blurred vision, seeing spots, or light sensitivity can be signs of preeclampsia—a condition requiring immediate care.

# 3. High Blood Pressure

Headaches accompanied by elevated blood pressure readings could indicate gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

# 4. Swelling

Sudden swelling in your hands, feet, or face, along with a headache, is another warning sign of preeclampsia.

# 5. Fever or Stiff Neck

These could indicate an infection, such as meningitis, which needs urgent medical evaluation.

# 6. “Thunderclap” Headaches

A sudden, intense headache described as the worst pain of your life should be evaluated immediately.

# Migraines vs. Regular Headaches

Migraines are a specific type of headache that can include additional symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and heightened sensitivity to light or sound. If you’ve had migraines before pregnancy, you may notice changes:

* **First Trimester:** Migraines may worsen due to hormonal shifts.
* **Second and Third Trimesters:** Many people report improvement as pregnancy progresses.

Discuss any significant changes in your migraines with your doctor, who can recommend safe treatments.

# Headache Prevention: Building Healthy Habits

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Here are some proactive steps to reduce headache frequency:

* **Prenatal Vitamins:** Ensure you’re getting essential nutrients like magnesium and B vitamins.
* **Good Posture:** Support your back and neck during daily activities.
* **Mindful Eating:** Focus on nutrient-dense foods and avoid long gaps between meals.
* **Manage Expectations:** Pregnancy is demanding—allow yourself rest and grace as your body adjusts.

# When to Seek Professional Help

Always trust your instincts. Contact your healthcare provider if:

* Your headaches are severe, persistent, or worsening.
* They’re accompanied by unusual symptoms like confusion, fever, or swelling.
* You’re unsure whether your symptoms require attention.

# Final Thoughts

Headaches during pregnancy can be uncomfortable, but they’re often manageable with the right approach. By staying hydrated, managing stress, and knowing when to seek help, you can keep headaches from overshadowing the excitement of your journey.

Remember, your body is doing incredible work. Give yourself permission to rest, recharge, and seek support when needed. If you’re ever in doubt about your symptoms, don’t hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider—they’re there to guide you through this transformative time.

1h2ghyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_initfusion/comments/1h2ghyp/how_small_businesses_can_thrive_with_mobile_app/,How Small Businesses Can Thrive with Mobile App Development,"Did you know that over 90% of mobile users spend more than 2 hours a day on their smartphones? This staggering statistic highlights how critical mobile presence is for any business. Today, mobile apps are not just for big corporations; they are transforming the way small businesses connect with customers. This article explores how [**mobile app development**](https://www.initfusion.com/) can benefit small businesses and drive growth.

**Enhanced Customer Engagement & Brand Loyalty**

**Improved Communication**

Mobile apps enhance communication with customers, offering direct channels through push notifications, in-app messaging, and personalized offers. For example, restaurants might send out daily specials via push notifications, inviting customers to visit. This keeps customers informed and engaged, leading to higher foot traffic and sales.

[Initfusion](https://preview.redd.it/t2j4kotims3e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcfc4968564ccb260bf12ea2df169ef4d5c6224a)

**Personalized Experiences**

Using the data collected from app usage helps businesses create personalized experiences. By analyzing customer preferences, a local boutique could tailor product recommendations in the app, making shopping more enjoyable. When customers feel understood, they are more likely to return.

**Loyalty Programs & Rewards**

[**Mobile apps**](https://www.initfusion.com/) excel at implementing loyalty programs. Businesses can reward customers for repeat purchases, enhancing customer retention. For instance, coffee shops using an app to track purchases might offer a free drink after ten visits, boosting customer loyalty. Studies show that 75% of customers are more likely to return when part of a loyalty program.

**Streamlined Operations & Increased Efficiency**

**Inventory Management**

Apps help small businesses monitor inventory effectively, reducing waste and improving operational efficiency. A small retail store could use inventory management apps to track stock levels and generate alerts for reordering, ensuring they never run out of popular items.

**Order Processing & Delivery**

Streamlining order processing via an app can significantly enhance customer satisfaction. A small catering business might implement an app that allows customers to place orders seamlessly, track their deliveries, and even schedule pickup times. Research shows that efficient delivery leads to a 20% rise in customer satisfaction.

**Employee Management**

Mobile apps also simplify internal operations, including task management and employee scheduling. According to HR experts, implementing a mobile-first approach improves team communication and collaboration, making it easier for everyone to stay on track and informed.

**Expanded Market Reach & Accessibility**

**Wider Customer Base**

A mobile app can expand a small business’s reach beyond local customers. Statistics reveal that users aged 18-44 spend an average of 3 hours per day on apps, representing a significant pool of potential customers waiting to be tapped into.

**24/7 Availability**

Offering services through a mobile app gives customers access around the clock. For example, an online store can allow shoppers to browse and purchase items at any time, leading to increased sales. A real-life success story is a local clothing retailer that saw a 30% increase in sales after launching their app.

**Global Accessibility**

Mobile apps help businesses reach international markets. As mobile app usage grows globally, small businesses can overcome geographical limitations. The global mobile app market is expected to reach $407.31 billion by 2026, presenting a golden opportunity for businesses to expand their horizons.

**Data-Driven Insights & Decision Making**

**Customer Behavior Analysis**

Apps collect valuable data on customer behavior and preferences. A small bookstore could analyze which genres are most popular, helping them decide on new inventory. Regularly reviewing this data leads to better understanding and serves customers more effectively.

**Targeted Marketing Campaigns**

With insights from app data, businesses can run effective marketing campaigns tailored to customer preferences. A local gym might promote a new workout class to users who frequently attend yoga sessions, resulting in higher sign-up rates. Personalized marketing can lead to a 20% boost in ROI.

**Business Performance Tracking**

Apps also facilitate the monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs). Business owners can track sales trends and customer engagement through easy-to-read dashboards. This data-driven approach enables better decision-making and strategic planning.

**Cost-Effective Marketing & Sales**

**Reduced Marketing Costs**

A mobile app can significantly lower marketing expenses. By reducing reliance on traditional advertisements, businesses save money. Research shows that mobile app marketing can be up to 30% more cost-effective than traditional marketing methods.

**Direct Sales & Transactions**

In-app purchases make transactions quick and easy, directly boosting revenue. A small bakery could include a feature for customers to order cakes through the app for special occasions, streamlining sales and enhancing customer convenience.

**Improved Customer Service**

Mobile apps often lead to faster and more efficient customer service. They eliminate the wait for responses to emails or phone calls. Customer service experts note that instant responses via chat features in apps enhance customer satisfaction and reduce service costs.

**Conclusion**

The advantages of mobile app development for small businesses are clear. From enhancing customer engagement and streamlining operations to reaching new markets and improving marketing efficiency, the benefits are plentiful. As consumers increasingly rely on their smartphones, mobile apps will continue to play a vital role in business success. Consider mobile app development as an investment in your business's future growth and customer satisfaction. Embrace this opportunity to connect and thrive in the ever-evolving marketplace.

At first, we were obsessed with each other (as expected) but as we keep going, more and more issues arise. She has put me in situations where we’re hanging out with her and her friends (about 3-4 times) and her friend in the group tells me that they slept with her (no judgement on previous sexual histories, I just would have rather known what I was walking in to) and her best friend said that she hated me for a reason that my girlfriend didn’t want to tell me (they slept together too).

First things first, hats off to good ol' Kate Watkins for capturing the fiery spectacle in action. You've got a future in journalism, Kate! 

Let’s get down to brass tacks. The article is leaner than a kangaroo’s hop, yet it delivers the punch: everyone is safe, and that’s the blaring horn of triumph in this scenario. What could have been a heart-wrenching headline has gracefully turned into a testament to alert drivers and swift evacuations.

The takeaway here is simple: quick thinking saves lives. It's a reminder that beneath our daily hustle and bustle, vigilance is our greatest ally.

So, what’s my two cents on this flaming affair? While fewer details might have left some insatiably curious, the essence captured is solid. As I always say, it’s better to report what happened in a heartbeat than to step on the brake.

I've now realised it's not for me. I'm autistic with processing issues and time blindness so doing things promptly with the constant checks that the PGCE involves has become too much to handle. So my dream of being a teacher isn't as easy as I thought it would be. I only have a few options left and need lovely Reddit to help me think through this.

1. Try primary teaching - The summer before starting my secondary teaching course, I volunteered teaching maths at a primary school during their last term (doing mainly Year 4 and 5). I loved it. The only reason I didn't immediately switch to primary is the little kids scare me, all kudos to those teachers because I can't imagine how to teach a 6 year old that can't stand still about World War 2. Only problem is money. The university I'm at now has recommended if I struggle with the workload I should do the 3 year BA course... But that's £27k. If I do the PGCE primary I might have the same issues I have now and that's another £9k on top of this failed PGCE.

2. Go back to my uni job - During university I had a job teaching English to adults. I fell in love with curriculum and lesson planning at that job. I talked to my friends who still work there and they say while there's no open positions at the moment they're happy to make one with the new funding coming in. Only problem - I went to university at the other side of the country and atm I live with my family. If I take this job I'll have no place to live, no family, and independent living again while my mental health is already rocky due to whole Plan B to my dream thing.

3. Get a job outside of teaching - After this stressful time part of me just wants a desk job where you just clock into the office, answer a couple emails and have a coffee, then clock out again. Unfortunately 'desk job' is not a title on LinkedIn. I can probably count the job titles I know on one hand - and they're jobs I'm either unqualified for (vet, accountant) or as high stress as teaching is (firefighter, doctor). Over lockdown I got really interested in the science of childbirth for some reason so it has been a running joke that I'll become a midwife if I can't teach but I didn't take biology further than the age of 16, so that only lead is purely a joke. What jobs do people have that is a desk job? Are they available to get with a psychology degree?

So I was attending my classes as usual so , I had a end term project to submit so I get a WhatsApp message from a girl from my class if she could join me, because I was doing my project solo, she told me her friends didn't prepare anything good and are planning on joining others so she was looking for a team, I didn't think much of it so I took her in my team.

So like in few meeting I told her the role that she has to fake that she played in project as it was ready, she asked me to explain everything in detail that I did, we got to meet here and there getting cold coffee while I used to explain her code.After project happened we got graded she asked me on instagram whether I wanted to go on a date as she found me a interesting person to talk to. 

I though about it a lot because I have never been on date like ever but I agreed to go on a date because I thought why not it might be a good experience. We went on date last to last Sunday, went to cafe, Ice cream parlor etc. It was a good experience since we both have hostels inside campus while we were our way back to campus she asked me if I wanted to go another date next week, I said ""sure.""


So it happened on previous Saturday my roommate told me that his girlfriend told him that girl I was going on dates with is already talking to a guy online and is dating another guy from neighbouring college. So I just heard that so I thought I will ask her tomorrow because I know things are not that bad right now and I don't want things to go any further if what I heard was true, so we went on another date we went to book store I got her a book she was eyeing because regardless of what I heard was true or not I wanted her to enjoy the day first. We went to another cafe and a mall.

So by the end as we were taking a walk before entering campys I asked her if she was dating any other people she hesitated a bit , I could sense , she then asked where did I hear this , I just said a friend told me without revealing any names, she told me she was  she wanted to have someone who she could enjoy with because her relation with the person from our nearby college weren't looking  good, I told her that I was not comfortable being that 2nd backup guy if she was thinking of me like that i said it politely.

So she kept little silent while our way back. Well she went to her hostel after that and I went to mine but I was just thinking did I do the right thing because I have never been in a relationship, but yeah I hope she nothing for better things for her I don't understand any reasoning she might or might not have but yeah, any  big brother/ big sister advice or point of view you guys could tell me.",1,1732864973.0,AskIndianWomen,2,1.0,False

They had ugly fights too where they publicly fought eventually things got over and she broke his heart so he realised his mistakes and what he did with me happened with him also he said I am sorry for what I have done with you. I want to make amends and don’t want to lose you. You have taken care of me and I haven’t spend this much time with anyone but you. I missed you and i have loved you. Also he said he got scared that’s why his always took a step back. I met him twice this week to clear out my issues and how much pain he has caused me. I asked him what are you expecting out of this then he said he wants to take things slow so that he doesn’t fuck up again. Also last night he played one song which that girl liked and his friends started saying “this you have heard enough let’s go to Gurgaon” they were taunting him as that girl lives in gurgoan.

I'm a female (40 years old), just back on the dating scene. 

Some months ago I broke up with my partner of several years and I feel ready for meeting a new person. I was like ""I'm not looking actively but if it happens is nice"".

Well, a couple of months ago I went out to drink a coffee with a handsome man (38 years old). He was funny, interesting, there was a lot of feeling. The coffee lasted three hours or more, something was going on. 

Unfortunately the timing was a bit off... he had to go out of town for job the day after, and when he turned back I was leaving for a trip that In organised long time ago. I was like ""so bad"", but I carried on with my things. 

Well, after 3/4 days from the coffee the guy started to text me. He texted me on a social network 2/3 times a week and we had some cute little chat... nothing too serious but we just kept in touch. 

Last evening I was on the couch with a fever, I'm abroad alone. He started to text me that he was turning back in town, he gave me all the details... how long he was going to stay, where, when... and I was a little sick and I get a bit emotional thinking to see him again. So I did something stupid... I just wrote him ""Beautiful, you come back in town, I wish you a nice trip and a nice back home"". He answered me just ""thank you"". And I was like ""why so cold?"". I felt asleep. The morning after fever was gone, I looked again at the chat and I said... ""oh shit! I just wished him a wonderful trip... but I didn't tell him when I was going to turn back or that we can meet up again!"". Perhaps he wrote me all that details because he wanted me to ask him out or at least give him some informations about when I was going to turn back. Didn't write anything because hours and hours were passed from the last message at that point. At the moment I just thought ""cool, we are going to meet again"", also because he wrote me before ""you will tell me all this things in person"". 

Well... he could also ask about me/about another date but he didn't. From the way he texts, I can see that he is a bit insecure.

So... do you think that I fucked it up? 

I'm in town again on Monday... I was thinking to write him on Monday evening something like... ""Hey! I'm back in town too! Do you want to meet up?""

Too late?

Am I being paranoid?

It is centuries that I don't date, my last relationship left me a bit scared/insecure and I didn't get that he wanted perhaps to know about me/me asking him to meet up again. 

What would you do if you were me?

I'm surely going to text him on Monday but I'm afraid that it is too late. On the other hand, if he really likes me he shouldn't care and be happy to see me... or not?

This week husband has annual leave Thursday and Friday. He normally wakes up about 5am for work and returns home about 3:30pm. 

My main issue is sleep, I am really struggling with the broken sleep at the moment. Yesterday because it was his first day off he stayed lying in bed until 9am which is fine but then I had to ask him to get up and help me as me & LO were going out for the day with my mum. Like yesterday he had almost a whole day no baby and got to just chill on his day off. 

So last night I have to wake him up for his feed with LO (as usual) and then I get up at 4 and do my feed. But then as usual LO is wanting cuddles ect from 5 onwards so I have to keep waking up and cuddling her, give her dummy ect. It’s creeping up to 7am and LO is cooing and ready to get up. And I’m getting more and more annoyed just sitting here stewing because he’s just lying there? As he always does. I snapped and said “maybe you could get up with her?” And he of course acts perfectly fine and reasonable like “yeah of course I can do that” so then I feel terrible for being snappy. But why can’t he just think “hey you know what, I’ve got a day off and I can give my wife a little break and lie in” I’ve asked him to think of these things and be proactive but he just doesn’t? It makes me feel like he just doesn’t care or he just values his own sleep too much. Why doesn’t he get up on a Saturday and take LO out for a walk so I can have time to drink a coffee? Like just be considerate? 

He’s not a bad dad or a bad husband at all, but I am definitely default parent and it fucks me off having to ask for a break when I feel like if it was the other way round I’d always be considerate of him. ",10,1732864437.0,beyondthebump,13,1.0,False

TL;DR Reddit, I have a massive crush on my boss’s friend, how do I drop hints that I am a lesbian and that I’m into her? How could I start to figure out she’s gay without stalking social media? For research purposes. 

Okay, so.. here’s the thing. Idk when or how this started to develop but I’ve got it so bad. Honestly, I didn’t pay much attention to it as I originally thought it was just innocent admiration. More of a “damn, I would really like to learn everything I can from you so I could be as good as you are in 10 years” kind of thing. 

Well, I’ve come to realize that perhaps it’s a bit more (okay a lot more) than a “I want to be you” thing and more of a “I want to be on top of you” (respectfully, if she’s down) kind of thing. 

The problem? WELL, it’s complicated. The woman in question? She’s my boss’s friend. And that’s maybe the least of my worries. 

Ugh. I’m pretty anxious about this post as I have a slightly irrational fear of someone I know irl would find this post (though unlikely if we want to be reasonably logical about this)  and just somehow instantly know exactly who and what I’m talking about. Oh god, I’d simply have to leave the country if anyone found out like… this. 😳

I’m not sure how to accurately describe our work environment as it’s kinda niche and specific. I guess the best general way to describe it without too many details would be that we are all professional athletes who compete as well as coach/train others in the sport. My boss (who has also been my coach/mentor since I was a teenager) and I are from one club while my boss’s friend is from another. At competitions, they usually help coach each other. 
So that means I’m also usually there too on the ground to help, move equipment, be another set of eyes/opinion, moral support, etc. when they are competing. In doing so, I’ve had quite a few opportunities to share the same space as the woman in question (lol I should really come up with an alias for her) which has been great because it’s inspired me to work harder on reaching my own goals in the sport as well. It’s kind of sparked a wave of refreshed motivation in me to not let my own training become stale. 
I’ve really enjoyed this woman’s perspective on things, her coaching style, her over all vibe. I have a lot of respect for her and what she has to offer. I’ve learned loads by just listening to her coach but she also takes time to explain or talk to me about what she sees. 
And not to mention, it’s always entertaining to be around her because this woman is hilarious. Nothing she says is ever negative, even when something doesn’t go right. It’s hard to explain but I am so damn attracted to her energy?? It’s just so damn good. 

And so I think maybe that’s how my gay ass started catching real feels. She’s not really the type I’m typically attracted to.. I try super hard to stay away from anyone who is in the same profession as me. 
But at the same time… I’ve very attracted to her. She’s tall, naturally pretty, a mix of bad ass but also quirky (almost awkward). Idk she’s just kind of perfect. 

I have no clue if she’s gay. I have suspicions that MAYBE… she’s not 100% heterosexual because most straight people really just are not as funny as she is without having to try. Her hands/nails are giving gay vibes. You guys know what I mean. But we’re also literally athletes so I’m not sure? 
I think she’s single… but again, idk. It’s hard to confirm. 
I think this is where maybe the age gap comes into play (I’m 30, she’s early 40s). I don’t think she uses social media very frequently. I added her on some SM but she hasn’t accepted my requests.  I don’t think that’s bc she wouldn’t. She’s busy and I doubt she gets on them often. And I’ve gathered she’s more of an unwind with wine and a book type than the endless scrolling type. I’d rather not approach her via text. I don’t really have any reason to text her out of the blue like that. I just feel like that’s weird. I’m going to have to communicate in person. Yikes!!

But how on earth do I even begin to drop some hints? Is there a way to show her I’m interested and that I  would like get to know her better? 

Does anyone have example or suggestions of questions I could ask her if the opportunity arises? Is there anything that I can do that, if she is into women, she’ll likely catch on that I’m flirting? 

I have always been overly aware that I’m a lesbian in a world full of straight women. I feel like in my attempts to make sure no one ever feels uncomfortable around me, I can be pretty cold/stoic/quiet and sometimes just flat out awkward at times. But it’s truly just bc I’m so afraid of being labeled as a creep. I feel like it’s time I try to come out of my shell if I ever want to have any chance. 

If she’s not wlw then that’s totally cool with me. Platonic friendships are great too. I typically don’t keep crushing once I know someone is straight, but I’d love to be like “hi be my friend you have good vibes”. 
Dating is hard but really what’s even more difficult is trying to make new friends as an adult. 

At our last competition, I asked her about her starbucks order after she mentioned wanting starbucks the previous morning. And you know my simp ass was prepared the next day with a coffee ready for her.
omg the way she was genuinely stunned (in a good way), thanked me, and like hurried away so quickly could very well have screamed “flustered gay”

But I overthink a lot. And then I started thinking.. maybe she was busy and had to rush to do something quickly (not uncommon for any of us in the sport, we are always running around super busy). OR oh god, maybe I made her uncomfortable??? 
maybe she really just was being about as awkward as I would have been if the roles were reversed. 

I’m tripping here bc the last time I had a crush on someone who wasn’t very clearly out and actively seeking a wlw relationship was when tumblr still existed and you could anonymously message people like “are u gay???” before embarrassing yourself. 

So what the hell do I do out there in the wild???

Someone please help me. Or just tell me it’ll be okay. I maybe just needed some friends to vent and fangirl about this woman to!!! 

You guys, I feel absolutely insane writing this post in a way that is somewhat anonymous (lmao I’m so sorry if it reads like delusional garbage but I’m literally like crushing so damn hard). 

I can’t really tell my friends about this bc they know who she is and I just feel like that would be so weird if I’ve got it all wrong and then I’m just that weird lesbian drooling over my boss’s friend?

If you got this far.. Thank you SO MUCH for sticking it out and reading this much of my chaotic word vomit. I really do appreciate any kind of suggestions or advice and your general support for just taking the time to hear me out. You guys are amazing. ",0,1732864304.0,LesbianActually,1,0.5,False

Never really thought I'd say anything to y'all, honestly; I've always been handy at finding excuses for my anxieties, or reasons to explain that what I had to say didn't matter, that I was just too small in a world that didn't care about me or anyone besides themselves.

But I don't feel that way anymore. And I certainly don't feel that way right now.

If you're just skimming through content, looking for something to fill the moments between idle time, then this post might not be what you're looking for. If you don't want to think about existentialism, or heavy mental health topics... It's okay! I forgive you in advance, you can go click something else or return to whatever else is going on in your busy lives. Just come back when you feel like the moment's right. Or don't. Who knows what the winds of fate will decide? 

That being said, I have a confession to make. I, as mentioned before, am a lurker on this sub reddit, and have been for a *long* time... and I NEVER posted until now.

Scandalous. 

Always watching on from the sidelines, cheering on the usual mix of horniness, top-shelf memery, and arguments that have been a much needed distraction from life, so many times. No matter what's going wrong in the world on the given day, I've always been able to look at y'all and see that I'm not alone. 

It's never that simple, though, is it? To say that there's always a rainbow after rain, that there's always some reason to live. I've had... it's really hard to grasp the fact that I've had a finite number of days on this earth, and the majority of them were fine until a few bad days poisoned my perspective. 

And when I reached out my hand for help, falling, I busted my ass on the pavement. Time and time again. Over and over.

Days became weeks, became years, became decades. And now I'm 21 years old. Young, and yet... I can't count on one hand the number of friends who've died younger. All that time... all that time, I felt like I was watching a bad movie. A complete joke, because I had every good intention (of course) and they were all being evil (yep uh huh keep telling yourself that buddy), and yet it kept getting worse and worse, like a cosmic tragedy centered around me being aware of things that other people weren't seeing.

For a long time, I thought I was insane. To my credit, I think I've come of age at a monumental time in human history, right at the point where decades of computational theory have aligned with massive coordinated global efforts, all just to let me have a cell phone that allows me to, at any moment, learn anything from anywhere. I should probably put quotes around ""learn"" but I'll stick a pin in that for now. 

There have been countless generations of people, working and living and dying since before my grandparents were alive, who've thought to themselves,

""Hey, if you set up dominos a certain way, they fall a certain way!""

...and went with it. And we figured out that radios, transceivers really, could turn binary data into long strings of waveform data. And we took that theory, and made the radio host. And we thought, ""couldn't we do that to images?"" And kept going until we found ways to change blinking lights faster than the eye could see. Connected magnets to them to make speakers, and found ways to send precise enough signals, that we can flick through 120 images in a split second, each image itself being made of millions of pixels, themselves made of LEDs so much tinier than we ever thought could be possible. And where are we now?

We're alive in a time, where the average person can be reasonably expected to own a good phone. A slab of metal, glass, rare elements, and a lot of carefully colliding sparks, connected to a cloud of information so vast it supercedes us. And the phone does its job, really really really fucking well. It delivers information, quickly, and precisely.  That's where it started getting messy, because we found out pretty soon after that, that it doesn't matter if you combine the collective triumphs of generations of scientists, engineers, and visionary geniuses into every single pocket in the whole wide world, if they don't feel like using the things you sank all your life's work into.

Because they've got their own lives! They've got kids, spouses, jobs, careers, anything worth being excited over, why should they interrupt that to worry about what some weirdo across the world thinks?

So, capitalism being the force of nature is it, both awesome and horrible, fueled the bittersweet insanity that I get to call my coming of age in the 21st century. More technological achievements than I could ever name, more names than I could ever know to thank, more infrastructure than I could ever explore, all built before I was born. And I've spent the majority of my time on this earth, having the absolute luxury of not really thinking about it. And so have most people, I think, because everyone's worried about what's important to them.

And I guess... I guess it just never really occurred to me that it was all real. That it was all the same reality, the memes and dreams and political insurrections. Because how could it be? It's just too much damn information to process.

But lately, I've been thinking about the process of how we send those signals. It turns out, our brains communicate information using neurotransmitters... via waveforms. And that's nothing new, there were decades of research before I was ever born (go read it! Really! It's cool!), and obviously it's not controversial to say people have thoughts. But... 

Lately, I've been realizing that it's all real. That every last meme, every typo, every badly cropped out watermark on every Twitter post passed around fifteen times, has been real. And more importantly, my entire life has been the perception of said information. After all, we're all just staring into slabs and hallucinating vividly. 

I guess to prove my point... you just lost the game. Yeah that's right, end your streaks, fuckers. 

Now imagine a time before you stared at your phone, hallucinating, and changed the shape of your brain to read that. Can you? 

Your eyes connect to the optic nerve, your ears connect to your cochlea. The stimuli you receive on a constant basis from those and your other senses, can all be expressed in waveform. In fact, that's why we experience anything at all, turns out. Your brain's a muscle, made of over a hundred billion neurons, with over a hundred trillion synaptic connections between them, and the way you've experienced everything in life has been a combination of chemicals, motion, and computational logic... that combine to make up the shape of the thoughts in your head.

So, I'm a musician. More specifically though, I've lately been getting into sound engineering, and it turns out the reason we can make all this amazing shit we have today to work with is because waveforms can be expressed in really really tiny shapes. Like, small enough to fit in your head, for your entire life, tiny. Teeeee-ny tiny tiny.

And I guess I started seeing it, after that one thought clicked into place. ""Your thoughts have shape, so they must be real."" I like the term social phenomenology: seeing people's heads as the vibrating, noisy machines they are, each coming from their own backgrounds, from their own perspectives, from their own times, all harmonizing or clashing together.

If I follow the logic further, it necessitates that I will die. We all do. And there's always someone spreading funny memes, or some tragedy in our government that's happening, so why should I think about that at all? It's easier to just push it away, not like I could ever fix it. No sense wasting your life in misery, might as well have some fun! Well that's how I felt for a long time. I got a bipolar diagnosis and a few dozen prescriptions to show for my refusal to stop having fun.

It wasn't like it was all going to start making sense, suddenly, right? Because if it ever did, then clearly anyone sane would look around at the world we inhabit and realize the humbling beauty, the scale of the cosmos, the meaningless of egotistical pursuits. Right? People don't just wise up to that, so why should I stop having fun?

And I had a lot of fun, don't get me wrong. I'm still going to have a lot more fun, with any luck too.

But knowing that my thoughts had shape... and were made of electrochemical waves... well, if there's one thing musicians know, it's harmony. And the idea of ""cognitive dissonance"" being literal... it just made me curious, the type of curious that you pause drug abuse for. And that was enough... just that spark of curiosity...

To lead me here. Where I'm sitting on my bathroom floor... a room likely very familiar and safe to anyone else out there who just needs a pause from the world. Pondering the implications of everything I've ever experienced, the unknowable multi-variable calculus of every thought I've ever had having HAD shape, and the conditions of what led them to be that way.

It's led me here... And I can safely say that if I'm insane, it's only because I see things more beautiful and more terrible than most people see. But I think y'all can all relate to that, in some way or another.

I guess that's my point? I just wanted to make a post to let y'all know that, yeah, it's that weird for me too. Because I can't even count how many days or nights I've waited for someone to just reassure me that what I felt was even real, or that it wasn't just me being born wrong, or seeing things wrong. 

Did I mention I'm colorblind?

There's always been a *literal* way for me to see things wrong, and now I'm looking back on my life, having been handed the most beautiful metaphor for it all, I can describe it pretty succinctly. I've always seen things a little differently. 

Being colorblind, queer, AuDHD, and about a dozen other mental health adjectives at any given year really sinks in the feeling of just seeing it wrong. And wondering what other people see, to make them see it ""right"". That's the feeling I'm really dedicating this ramble to, the people who are on the verge of internalizing that doubt. 

To you, I say, there's an answer. *I* don't have it, but we're alive in a day and age with cell phones, cheap coffee, and spare time. If the answer can't be found easily, it's probably a good question. But don't lose sight of the people who've come before us, who've tackled the same questions, and slowly built up answers, building more and more until it got us cell phones. Don't lose sight of that.

Enjoy the view from the shoulders of giants, and never forget that your idols had parents who loved them too. What comes next, will be awesome, I know it. 

I guess that's all from me today. I love you. You reading that has just made the words take shape in your head. So go forward and spread some love, in whatever way you think is coolest.

How do I discuss it with her? ,"For context, I moved over 1000 miles away from my wife and family for a job opportunity (little over 6 figures, more than anyone else in my family), and while my wife and I have been together for 5+ years, this is the second year I've been away from home for the holidays, and based on finances and work responsibilities, I'll be here by myself for Christmas too. And on the holidays it's just not enough.

Long distance is always hard, but my wife and I have been making it work, good contact, communication, and honesty about long-distance intimacy. She and my mother get along swimmingly, so much so, they spent Thanksgiving together (my wife has no good relationship with her parents), but my problem this year is just that we didn't really do anything together, and if we did do things together, it wasn't nearly enough.

I spent the day before working with my mother to set up a way for us to video chat/hangout and maybe even play a video game together, something simple and light, just a way to hang out. But today I didn't get a call from my wife until 11:45 a.m., and since I knew she was having dinner with my mom, and maybe having a post dinner nap, I really didn't want to bother them, but finally around 7 p.m., I called them to see if they wanted to do any of the things I set up or suggested...and they were too tired.

I get it.

They both work jobs that are more physically demanding than mine, but I checked my phone today, and my wife and I talked for all of an hour and a half today.

And I'm not mad, or really even sad...just disappointed. Like I had plans, I made an effort, and I don't know if I just didn't communicate how important it was to me.

Later she called me on her way home and I really didnt have the energy to get into it, so I just let it go, but to be honest, she didnt really ask either.

I know I can't expect other people to read my mind but...hello, I'm 1000 miles away alone...isn't it...obvious?

I spent the day playing video games by myself, and having an alcoholic coffee or two.

I don't want to make my wife feel bad or end the relationship or anything crazy like that. But I'm really hoping someone can help me voice how I'm feeling to her in a constructive way.

Honestly, I mostly made this to vent, so I'm not so emotional whenever I do decide to bring it up.

But it just never seems like a good time between her getting off work, or being at work, or being too tired from work. Not that she's a stone wall, she listens well, but with everything else on her plate I don't want to add to it.

Dear lord this ended up way too long.

TLDR; Felt like I didn't get enough attention while away from wife on the holidays, need advice how to discuss it with her.

P.S. please don't tell me to divorce my wife or insult or yell at her, that shit goes right in the trash can.

1h2g6qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1h2g6qo/how_satisfactory_has_changed_my_life/,How Satisfactory Has Changed My Life,"Hey fellow spaghetti builders, efficiency feinds and cosmetic lovers

I don’t usually post on Reddit most of the time, I’m here for game guides, bug fixes, or tips—but I felt compelled to share something a little different. This is about how Satisfactory helped me get my life on track, and I hope it resonates with someone out there.

For years, I’ve struggled with alcohol and substance abuse. What starts as “fun and games” spirals out of control quickly, and before I know it, I’m trapped in another cycle. I’d quit drinking before, but without distractions or changes to my routine, I’d always fall back into 12-month binge-drinking sessions.

I grew up gaming—played everything from MMOs to shooters—but I never found a game that felt like “home.” Most of my hours went into competitive games, and while they’re fun, they didn’t align with what I needed from gaming: an escape, a way to relax, and something to take my mind off the noise.

Fast-forward to now: I’m in my 30s, I’m a dad, and I’ve got a different outlook on life. But I was still stuck with the same old drinking habit. It was expensive, draining, and honestly, most days, it just made me feel worse. And yet, I couldn’t break free.

Thatz where Satisfactory comes in.

It might sound small to some, but for me, it’s been monumental. I started playing Satisfactory a few weeks ago. At first, it was just another game to check out. But I noticed something strange: during those first few nights, I didn’t get up to grab a drink. I’d think, “I’ll get one after I finish this,” but the game kept me so engaged that I didn’t bother.

I made a promise to myself: I wasn’t going to worry about being super efficient or building the “best” factory. I was just going to ""play lego"", build what I wanted, and let my mind focus on something creative.

At the time, I was drinking 10+ drinks a day—an unbreakable ritual. But night by night, Satisfactory started replacing it. My partner even pointed out that I hadn’t bought drinks recently, and it hit me-this game was helping me quit.

So, I made a decision. I calculated how much money I’d saved from not drinking and decided to invest it into something positive. I bought a mic and camera and started streaming my play sessions. It’s not about views or followers and neither is this post —it’s about talking, expressing myself, and working things out, whether creatively or by laughing at my terrible spaghetti builds.

Suddenly, things started clicking. My relationships improved (I built my partner a little PC with the money I saved so she could play beside me)

I’m still early in my Satisfactory journey—just over 200 hours—but I already know this game has changed my life. It’s given me a healthy distraction, a creative outlet, and a way to reclaim control over my habits.

So, thank you, Coffee Stain Studios. You’ve got a fan for life.

Also I just want to say 

If anyone out there is struggling with something similar, know that change is possible. Sometimes, it just takes the right distraction to help you see what’s really important...it could be satisfactoy

Cheers to building a better future—one factory at a time.

A very grateful spaghetti builder

It will sound like I’m fishing for compliments at the beginning but I promise just stay with me.

I was at a shopping mall and I’d gone into this store to buy a bag and I didn’t speak the language of that country so I had to speak English with them and the worker there didn’t understand so this guy stood in and acted as a translator for me. I initially thought he worked there and he helped translate back and forth until I bought a bag and left the store but he followed me out and as I was standing outside checking a text he started talking to me and asking where I’m from and all that. Let me just explain, I’m not attractive so I avoid men at all costs because the last time I gave it a try the guy was only interested in me sexually and didn’t take me seriously. I don’t have a ‘nice body’ by any means. I’m not skinny nor thin in a healthy way. I don’t have a defined waist because of my wide rib cage. I have prominent shoulders. I’m 171cm/5’7 which itself is unattractive to most guys because shorter girls are preferred. I do have wide hips and I’m not flat but combined with all the other stuff, my body is neither attractive nor petite. I’m not the attractive kind of curvy basically. Maybe like a linebacker or something lmao and my face is definitely below average. I was wearing a body hugging dress and had my makeup and hair done because even though it doesn’t make me pretty I just want to feel presentable to be in public  I guess so when the guy asked if I could have coffee with him I wanted to say no. He was above average and a lot taller than me and like I said I avoid men whether or not they’re attractive not just because I know they don’t want anything serious with me but even if they did (which has never happened) my self esteem is too low and I’m not attractive enough to keep them around. But because I’m shy and have people pleasing tendencies (that I’m working on) I said yes without thinking and we went to get coffee. When we sat down he asked me a bunch of normal questions as you would when getting to know someone and I found out he’s 23 which is a year older than me and he told me he used to be in a relationship but had to break up due to the girls mom being ‘crazy’ and her dad as well and I thought red flag. He asked if I’d been in a relationship and I said no because I truly hadn’t. I expressed that I avoid relationships and he instantly knew and finished my sentence for me he said “because you don’t want guys to use you sexually” and I agreed and he said he liked that. Whatever that means. After some conversation he told me he’s leaving the city at 2am for work and won’t be back for 11 days and he asked if he could ‘come by my hotel’ when I’m done shopping and I was shocked at that and I was literally clutching my shopping bags and wanted to get out of there but then he was like “no I meant to pick you up” I don’t remember if that’s exactly how he said it or even if it was sincere but I doubt it. He asked me more questions and I told him I was there not for vacation but because I was getting jaw surgery and he was like “you don’t need to you’re beautiful” in my head I was like I need it for my bite but okay thanks. Anyways he told me he wanted to come pick me up and take me to a restaurant or something but I declined because not only did I not want to go but I had a feeling he wasn’t being sincere with me. He’d seen an ugly girl who was passable enough to sleep with one time before leaving the city and he took the chance thinking throwing some compliments my way would make sleep with him. At the end he gave me his instagram and that didn’t last long either because I saw he follows soooo many extremely attractive girls who could pass for ig models (and a lot if not all followed him back so what does he want from me except a quickie lol) and I’d asked him a question over text he was being kind of rude answering it like “I already told you” which to be fair, his English was good enough to understand but he wasn’t fluent so I don’t know but I still thought it was rude (combined with him following so many girls) and I just didn’t text back and he didn’t text me either and that was that. I’m in no way hung up on him because I didn’t feel anything for him what just bothers me is he definitely just wanted a quick fuck with a girl who is ugly enough for her low self esteem to allow him to do it literally the day we met. It was like a wake up call.

I’ve seen a lot of guys admit they’d lie to average even ugly girls just to sleep with them because when they want to just have sex the attractiveness of the girl doesn’t matter because they just want the sex and no other part of her. and if they’re lucky she’d be pretty but still have a self esteem low enough to ‘let them hit’

As I’m writing this I’m wondering if he was even being truthful about leaving the city for work. He was going a little far so he was going by plane so I understand the 2am thing but I believe he wanted to use me for sex and then have the excuse of not being able to meet up because he’s ’left for work and won’t be back’ until I leave myself lmao ",5,1732863720.0,ForeverAlone,4,0.78,False

1h2fuxr,https://i.redd.it/y025pe7qes3e1.jpeg,Are 3D motion ads more effective than live-action videos?,"
Let me ask you this: Would you rather watch a perfectly scripted movie… or a poorly rehearsed reality TV show? That’s the difference between 3D motion ads and live-action videos. One’s polished, dynamic, and controlled down to the last pixel, while the other… well, let’s just say, good luck getting the lighting, actors, and props just right for every take. In the world of advertising, 3D isn’t just a video—it’s an experience.


---

🎨 ""In 3D, Even Your Coffee Mug Can Have Star Power""
Here’s the beauty of 3D motion ads: you can take any product and make it a celebrity. Have a chair? Spin it in mid-air like it’s auditioning for Cirque du Soleil. Selling sneakers? Boom—add explosions, glowing trails, or even a storyline where the shoes outrun a robot apocalypse! Live-action videos, meanwhile, are stuck with, “Um, can someone hold this in front of a plain white background?” Yawn.


---

🕹️ ""Total Control: The Video Game Advantage""
Ever tried directing a live-action shoot? It’s like trying to herd cats while blindfolded. Weather delays, actors forgetting lines, props breaking—it’s chaos. But in 3D? The sun shines when you tell it to. The camera flies where you want it. And the product? It doesn’t have an agent demanding green M&Ms in its trailer. You’re in total control. It’s advertising with god-mode turned on.


---

🛍️ ""Sales Are 3D’s Favorite Dimension""
Let’s talk results. A sleek, high-energy 3D motion ad grabs attention faster than live-action can say, “Cut!” And because 3D is tailor-made to highlight features, it sells more, period. The texture, the shine, the jaw-dropping zoom-in on your product’s best angle—it’s a sales pitch disguised as art. Live-action? Best case, it’s a pitch disguised as… another ad.


---

🧑‍🚀 ""Why Settle for Real When You Can Go Unreal?""
And here’s the real kicker: 3D motion ads aren’t limited by reality. Want your product to float in space? Done. Need it to burst into neon sparks while a dragon flies by? Easy. Live-action hits its limit the second your budget runs out—or when physics says, “Nope.” In 3D, the only limit is your imagination (and maybe your render time).


---

🎤 ""In Conclusion, Live-Action Can Take a Seat""
So here’s the deal: 3D motion ads aren’t just an alternative to live-action—they’re an upgrade. They’re customizable, captivating, and endlessly creative. The best part? Your product always gets top billing. So, if you’re still stuck debating between 3D and live-action… the answer is simple. Cue dramatic 3D zoom-in: ""Go 3D, and let your product steal the show.""

We hope to move out of it soon and go to an apartment, but the sad part about that is an apartment is more expensive than our house with significantly less space.

Hemosiderin is a structure that keeps or maintains iron within the body. In case of deficiency in iron level of a population or throughout the body, levels of hemosiderin are mostly found in macrophages in bone marrow, spleen and the liver. However, excessive amounts of hemosiderin within organs can be harmful to the tissue itself and to the body as it can absorb most of the available iron enzymes, resulting in tissue damage or maleficence of organs which includes hemosiderosis and hemochromatosis.

Iron overload can often lead to clinical intervention, yet a well-planned diet may aid in hemosiderin therapy. Intentional dietary habits may be able to address iron deposition by modifying the quantitative amounts of iron absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and thus, the chances related to that condition might be lowered. The deposition of hemosiderin in tissues is known as [hemosiderin staining](https://elitevs.com/hemosiderin-staining-causes-and-remedies-unveiled/), which is usually a secondary of any venous insufficiency, trauma or inflammation. The potential of using dietary supplements to reduce hemosiderin content, as well as recommendations on dietary changes will be discussed in the next sections.

# Understanding Hemosiderin and Iron Metabolism

Before looking for dietary options to regulate hemosiderin, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of iron metabolism in the body. Iron is a necessary mineral, necessary for synthesis of hemoglobin, myoglobin and various enzymes. Still, due to the limited active iron emission system in the body, it is necessary to manage iron intake from food with accuracy.

Hemosiderin is produced when the body’s ability to store iron in ferritin, more easily available form of iron, exceeds. This is usually caused by excessive iron intake in the diet, constant blood pressure or other factors that disturb the metabolic balance of iron. Although hemosiderin itself is not considered dangerous, its accumulation can lead to oxidative stress and potential tissue damage.

# What Causes Increased Hemosiderin Levels?

Excessive accumulation of hemosiderin and iron can occur through a variety of pathways, including:

* Iron absorption is increased due to genetic disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis

* Regular discharge of blood as seen in cases of chronic anemia or sickle cell anemia

* The intake of excessive amounts of iron-containing foods or the use of irregular supplements can lead to excessive amounts of iron in the diet

* Chronic liver disease or other disorders that defect the body’s ability to effectively store and process iron

The diet plays a significant role for people with underlying diseases or at risk of health problems related to hemosiderin.

# How Diet Influences Iron Absorption

Iron absorption in the diet varies considerably. It is necessary to understand various types of iron and factors affecting its absorption to manage hemosiderin levels.

* **Heme Iron vs Non-Heme Iron**

Heme iron, prevalent in animal products such as red meat and poultry, is absorbed more efficiently by the body. Non-heme iron, present in plant sources such as beans and leafy greens, is absorbed less efficiently, which may be beneficial for managing iron intake.

* **Iron Absorption Modifiers**

Various dietary components can influence the absorption of iron in the gut, either enhancing or inhibiting it.

* Vitamin C and heme work as iron enhancer that facilitate non-heme iron absorption.

* Some examples of inhibitors are calcium, polyphenols, tannins and phytates. These can reduce iron absorption from food. Diet can control hemosiderin levels via these factors.

# Dietary Strategies for Managing Hemosiderin

Adopting a thoughtful approach to your diet can play a significant role in managing iron absorption and regulating hemosiderin levels. Here’s how to structure a diet to support better iron balance.

**1. Limit Heme-Iron Intake**

Limit your intake of red meat, liver and other organs to increase the absorption of heme iron. These foods are beneficial for health; however, excessive consumption can increase iron storage. When consuming animal protein, choose lean poultry or fish as they have lower levels of heme iron than red meat. Spinach, legumes, beans and fortified cereals contain slow-absorbing non-heme iron. Based on your hemosiderin level and health, non-heme iron can help you maintain iron levels without overload.

**2. Use iron absorption blockers**

 Tannins and polyphenols (tea/coffee) might hinder iron absorption, especially when ingested alongside iron-rich meals. Foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt can hinder intestinal iron absorption. Whole grains, nuts, and seeds include phytates, which impede iron absorption. Iron absorption is blocked by (phosvitin) in eggs.

**3. Limit Vitamin C with High-Iron Meals**

A diet high in vitamin C maintains good health while increasing the absorption of non-heme iron. Therefore, in order to lessen the amount of iron that gets absorbed, one must refrain from eating vitamin C-rich foods as well as avoiding vitamin C-rich supplements. In order to prevent an excess of iron from being absorbed while still maintaining a healthy iron content in the body, vitamin C should be included in the diet, but in limited amounts only.

**4. Beware of Iron Supplements**

Modest iron requirements are common among persons afflicted with other anemia-related disorders, and there is frequently the inclusion of supplements. It is advised to seek medical answers before iron supplementation therapy, which has the potential of causing overload yet can be regulated through the management of hemosiderin articles. To the context of this paper, the research also focuses on the safety of supplement intake and diet.

**5. Stay Hydrated and Support Liver Health**

In order to achieve and sustain good health and proper balance of iron it is necessary to have adequate water and liver functioning. Preserves liver iron reserves for good health.

* Drink enough water daily.

* Limit your use of processed foods and alcohol.

* Garlic, turmeric, and leafy greens are liver-friendly.

**6. Avoid Cooking with Cast Iron**

Add iron to your meals with raw iron pottery. Alternatively, nonstick or stainless steel cookware might assist with the regulation of hemosiderin levels.

# The Role of Professional Consultation

Although these dietary options might assist, hemosiderin management has to be done on a case by case basis. If you notice signs of iron overindulgence such as diarrhea, organ failure or use of drugs, be sure to seek medical advice. Specialists in nutrition and hematology are able to formulate diets, check the concentration of iron in the blood and provide therapeutic phlebotomy or chemotherapy.

# Final Thoughts

The suggested changes in nutrition might assist in the control of hemosiderin levels. A variant of an absorption modifier, naturally, would be iron itself, taken in moderation since over ingestion might lead to complications. Therefore it is paramount that one regulates the different forms of iron while eating.

This approach improves hemosiderin treatment by promoting better dietary habits. If therapy due to hemosiderin or iron levels poses an issue, one must consult primary care doctors for an individual work plan.",1,1732862221.0,varicoseveinscare,0,1.0,False
1h2fp7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1h2fp7r/im_here_to_rant_about_how_overconsumption/,I’m here to rant about how overconsumption destroyed me and idk how to fix it,"As a 23F who is actively on social media and exposed to constant stimulation irl, overconsumption has not only destroyed my mental health but also my financial health. I finally broke away from its chains about 2 months ago and I am trying so hard to recover.

I’m in graduate school and already have student loans from that. On top of credit card debt from over consumption and just life expenses. I also have a house so that’s added onto that. We hope to move out of it soon and go to an apartment, but the sad part about that is an apartment is more expensive than our house with significantly less space.

I have given away/donated/thrown away so many things and down sized drastically. I have purged my closet, donated so much, thrown away any random trinkets, etc. It’s not even clothes that I had too much of, it’s everything. Perfume, candles, hair products, skin care products, literally everything! 

How do I stop being tempted to buy so much? I mean as silly as it sounds, it’s hard for me to force myself not to get a $5 coffee a few times a week. I do have a nespresso so I’ve leaned on that more, but still. 

I know I am very privileged to even be making this post complaining about how I have “so many things”, but having access to adult money and adult credit cards has really hurt me more than it’s helped me as I get older.

Any advice, comforting words or just plain guidance would be so appreciated. ",2,1732862123.0,Adulting,4,0.75,False

Warm under his blankets, warm under his sheets and his head was warm against the pillows. Life, life was great. He had a mother that cared for him, he was successful in school and was great at football. He was told that he was going to have a great future according to his teacher and he believed that. 

He opened his dry eyes to be greeted by blinding light coming from his window, the smell of breakfast that had recently been made made its way up into his room, making him feel hungry. He put on his socks to walk down the stairs, being greeted by a plate and a note. 

*You wouldn’t wake up, so I put your breakfast on this plate. Love you! - Mom* The note read.

On the plate there were biscuits and eggs. Next to the plate was a fork and a knife but he cut away with only the fork. When satisfied, he put his plate away to grab his shoes and walk out the door.

It was bright outside, no clouds were showing in the sky and it was very warm. Walking through the streets, he passed by the bakery where the smell of fresh bread wafted out of the vents tempting him to go inside. *Maybe next time.* He thought as he got out of range. 

He walked by a field filled with kids playing football, kicking the ball to one another in the hopes of making a goal. A drummer sat on the side making quiet taps against the surface. The drummer unexpectedly lifted his hand up and crashed it against the drum resulting in a *boom!*

He sat up quickly in a cold sweat, realizing where he actually was. His heart was beating fast and his breathing was shaky. He never really did wake up in that warm bed, did he? He didn’t get to eat those eggs or read that note, because he wasn’t even home. He wasn’t on some soft mattress, he was on some cold and unwelcoming mud. 

His eyes now truly felt tired as he finally came up to speed and his situation. He was sitting inside of a shoddily built bunker to protect him from artillery fire but if it was directly hit, they would all die.

He was with other soldiers in here, all trying to sleep but failing. He rubbed his eyes, they were wet. He must have been crying while remembering his home. He missed it so much and how nice it was there.

He saw a pistol.

He remembered the way his friends would joke around about who was the best at anything.

He felt the grip.

He remembered when his mom would comfort him with trips to the bakery or cook his favorite meal when he was sad.

He tasted metal in his mouth.

He also remembered when they had enough money to go on that trip.

He felt his finger on the trigger.

He didn’t think he was going to remember anymore.

**Adan Baumer, Cerviun soldier**

All this marching was driving him crazy, this stupid, *stupid* marching. The hours felt like days to poor Adan Baumer, a regular soldier with a regular rank. His boot sank into the mud beneath him, he groaned. 

*Stupid mud, stupid marching.* He thought as he struggled to get his boot out of the mud. *This isn't how I imagined the military.*

He jogged to catch up with the line, but nobody would care if he didn't. They hated him. 

""We have three more miles! If any of you poor saps have any complaints, throw them away and keep your mouth shut!"" Their commander yelled, Adan just nodded. When they had gone through another mile of the march, Adan felt pain in his feet. But he just had to keep marching along. 

*Just a little longer. I can just make it three more miles.* His feet were on fire, causing him to groan with every step he took. He looked up to see one of his comrades shaking his head at him.

*I should have done more PT,* he thought.

*Left. Right. Left. Right.*

Adan’s legs felt like lead.

*Left. Right. Left. Right.*

His gear was getting heavier and heavier.

*Left. Right. Left. Right.*

Adan was about to collapse.

*Left. Right. Left. Right.*

What could be no more than one hour felt like 2 days when they finally arrived.

""Congratulations fellas, you've made it to where you will be staying."" Commander Karsk shouted at them, making sure everybody could hear. ""You should all get some rest. Await further orders."" 

Adan sighed with relief, and he plopped down. He grabbed his bag and pulled out his rations of beef and corn, in a can of course. 

""Adan! You're going on guard duty tonight. Silently take out any Veruckians or Grasen, do not use your rifle, got that?""

*For fuck’s sake.* He grabbed his gear and headed off to his post.

\*\*\*

When night arrived, he was already standing outside of the camp, looking around tiredly for any threats. He scanned the same bush for the umpteenth time, muttering to himself with complaint. He heard some leaves and sticks cracking and he whipped around.

""Hey, it's just me. I'm taking your spot."" Adan said a little thank you, his comrade only replied by rolling his eyes.

He settled down onto the hard dirt, hoping he could get some sleep. He closed his eyes, thinking of the next day that was to come.

\*\*\*

Görvan Schleef, Republic of Gräsen

Görvan walked through the forest, quietly. He was with his hunting friends, searching for the perfect animal to hunt.

 He had a weird feeling about today, he didn't exactly know what it was for but it was there. It felt like he knew something big was going to happen, but after thinking about it, he narrowed it down to paranoia.

""Hey Görvan, remember that time you got fucked up by a bucks antlers? That shit was hilarious. But seriously, you don't need to be so jumpy,"" one of his hunting companions stated from his left.

He admitted that one particular section of his life had been funny, nearly dying. However, he always had one question, what if he had died? What if he went to sleep and never woke up, just stayed asleep, forever? It scared him, it got him nervous even though it happened years ago. 

""Hey man, are you good? You seem a little uhhh, out of your head."" Said Merkel, his hunting companion, and good friend.

""Oh yeah, heh, it was pretty funny. But I do think the loss of blood has made my brain a little strange. I occasionally slur my words, or if I stand up too fast my vision goes dark.""

""Yeah, that's not normal. Hopefully you don't get attacked again, you psycho."" Merkel replied.

""Oh, come on, I'm not that psychotic. Just a bit not oaky in the head."" Görvan said while being a little loopy and tired.

They walked hundreds of feet in silence, Görvan's paranoia attacking his brain and making him feel funny. Perhaps he didn't have enough coffee, or caffeinated drinks.

""You just said 'oaky', maybe you should be taken to a Psych ward.""

Görvan just ignored that as he stopped to dig through his bag, finding an energy bar to eat. It wasn't enough to satiate his hunger of course, but it would have to do for the couple more hours they were out here. It tasted funky and stale, making him wrinkle his nose as he ate it. He didn't exactly like these bars, but he still ate them, like he was addicted. The texture was powdery and artificial, not the worst he's had, but it was still bad.

He also decided to inspect his rifle while eating, brushing his hand over the wood and metal components. He made sure to turn the safety on so he or Merkel didn't lose anything of theirs. He did need to fingers to hunt after all.

Merkel began discussing all of the different things they could shoot. Boar, Elk, Bucks, Bears, and any other legal animals. He personally liked bears the most, probably due to the fact that it always gives him an adrenaline rush whenever he hunts them. 

There was rusting and growling not too far from them. Merkel and Görvan stood up with their rifles and looked towards the noise. They lowered to a crouch when they felt they were near, this slowed them down. But they could always stand back up if they needed to run.

At first Görvan didn't see anything, but then he spotted some blue and green, then red and tan. 

He thought it was only stories, stories where humanity fell in a far away place that they had to flee. 

Stories where creatures bloodlust caused their near extinction.

However, what he was looking at wasn't a story. It looked real, real enough that his doubts of them existing completely vanished. 

So that must mean the stories are true. That the human genocide was true. That there is a far away land in the middle of the ocean.

Görvan knew what he had to do, to save them all again. So they could see how it feels to be hunted.

He took aim, and put his finger on the trigger.

\*\*\*

""So, you managed to find a storybook creature, kill it, and you want us to come look at it? I'm sorry sir, but this sounds ludicrous."" The man behind the desk stated with a chuckle, showing his skepticism.

""No, its true! I swear, I left my friend, Görvan, to stay with it while we got the game master to look at it, and this could mean there are more of them, maybe the stories are true."" Merkel replied with frustration as he knew what he saw was real. ""Just get the game master over there, and then I'll be done. Ok?""

The man behind the desk, who he had been talking to for 5 minutes, seemed to be very amused by his antics. He probably thought he was crazy, maybe he was, but this was the realest thing he had seen in his life. He had touched the creatures, felt the scales, looked at the different colors, it was too real to have been imagined.

However, the man behind the desk didn't believe him, and the chances of him actually getting the game master were low. He thought of different ways to get people to come look. Fake an injury and get ""help""? No, he and Görvan weren't good enough at acting to pull that off. Pull it into town with a big automobile, or what people started referring to as ""Trucks"". Based off of looks though, the creatures seemed to be around 3-5 tons, too big for these ""Trucks"" to drag.

Maybe a simple picture could be it, but he wanted people to *see* the creatures, to look at their scales, feel the rough skin, believe him. He needed the game master.

The man behind the desk took the tooth pick out of his mouth, and spoke, ""I'll tell you what, we send some guys over there to look. If they see them too, we'll take them to the capital and have the lab coats examine them. Alright? I think that's a might fine plan.""

""Thank you sir, I'll see you there."" Merkel thanked the man,

""Oh, I wont be going. It'll be some other fella's. I just sit here."" 

*Lucky bastard, I wish I could do that,* Merkel thought as he walked out of the hunting office. It was quite cool inside and out, the streets were filled with many pedestrians. The ones that were in there with him were giving weird looks, probably thinking he's crazy. He is not crazy.

He got onto the train to go to the next stop, then he'll wait for the ""fella's"" to arrive. Finally, he'd take them to the creatures and Görvan to see. They'll believe him, then he won't be so crazy anymore.

He watched as the train started chugging along, watching it exit the station.

""Coffee?"" Offered a service member,

""Yes, black please."" He replied.

He was grateful for the coffee. He was proving a point, so it tasted even better.

\*\*\*

In the east near the borders of Gräsen, the Cerviun army is preparing. They are near the invasion, near their major plan.

In Pyrrhia, they are wondering why exploration group 13 hasn't returned, maybe they should go that way to check on them.

And Görvan, Görvan is wondering why in the world is there a dragon on Corvus?

Yall, I suck ass at writing so give some constructive criticism to help me improve. Anyways, thank you for reading this shitty ass chapter.

Chapter 2

There was a knock on the other side of the door, the sound of knuckles hitting would banging across the room.  ""Come in,"" General Peter told the one knocking, ""and be quick."" 

A tall, slender man walked into the room carrying documents and papers. Peter beckoned for him to sit, and he did so. He was noticeably nervous, his hand clenched, beads of sweat gathering on his forehead.

""Well, tell me the reason you're here,"" The General stated bluntly.

""We- Well sir, uhm. I have brought some news, but I can't really say its good news."" He replied while rubbing his hands together. ""One of our trains has, well, uhm, derailed."" He said with a shaky voice. ""We don't know how yet.""

""That is incredibly unfortunate, depending on what they were transporting.""

""Weapons and ammunition sir, and possibly some food for the soldiers. We are working on covering it up and saying it was only grain."" His voice had gotten quieter while speaking. 

""How about this, we find whoever made the rails and give them a 'talking to', then we can chat later,""  Peter said with a hint of malice in his voice.

""Y-Yes sir, I can do that.""

""Good, now I think you should go back to your job, don't you think?"" He replied.

""Yes, General. I will see you later,"" he stopped at the door, ""I shall see you later.""

\*\*\*

He shut the General's door behind him and let out a breath he had been holding, that was way too stressful for his liking. The General was just terrifying to be around, he made him feel unsafe and uncomfortable.

He walked into a nearby coffeehouse, as he was pretty hungry. He ordered his food, a sandwich along with some coffee. He needed energy to drive the long distance that was his nightmare called a job. Even after ordering, he studied the menu even more. Looking over their food items like sandwiches, salads, and even something new supposedly called a ""Grilled Cheese.""

He looked out the window and looked at the busyness of everything. Bikers on the sidewalks, pedestrians walking in and out of stores, restaurants and the theater. He sighed and close his eyes. He was in his own world long enough to not even notice the plate and cup right in front of him. He grabbed the op and bottom piece of bread and shoved it into his mouth. His gaze returned to the outside. 

*Hope there isn't a draft,* he thought, *people would be unhappy. Its all glory and honor as long as its not them at the front.*

*Of course, they don't know yet. Only few know, including me. Probably because I have to ship the munitions and everything.* He stopped chewing to think, *If I plan carefully, I could escape. But its a long ways to any nation not in our little pact. I know damn well they think I'm expendable, just canon fodder. I can't deal with this shit.*

He pushed his seat out and stood up, then walked to the door and opened it.  Due to the restaurant being dim inside, opening the door caused a flash of light in his vision and blinded him. After the flashbang he walked into the street once again. However, he went to his car instead of walking into nearby stores. When he was inside he reached for the knob that turned his radio on.

*A voice came over,* ***""****Our top news****:*** *A train carrying grain has been derailed on its way to the city of Traum. The cause of the derailment is unknown, but one of the bigger theories is failure to build the railway properly. One of the crewm****e****n was injured while the other appears to have gone AWOL. Could this be a purposeful sabotage? Nobody knows. This has been ou****r*** *top news.""*

He sat there for a minute just letting his car run. *Could it have been sabotage?*  *Are there others trying to delay the plans and escape? The higher ups will definitely believe it was sabotage. I do believe the rail company is partly at fault, but he must have done something while the other person was looking away.* He put his foot on the petal and started driving. *It is reasonable, but we were told what would happen if we defect. I remember ""The Room"" and what they showed us in it.*

He turned around a corner and just remembered the footage of being dismembered, skinned, even medieval methods like stretching your limbs until they were pulled from your sockets. He admitted he was stupid to plan an escape, but now whoever was in that train is in much much worse danger than he is. The higher ups didn't know what he was planning, but they sure as hell knew what the man in the train did and they were going to find him. 

*That train derailed near the Bulgan Forrest, its going to be hard to find him but its also going to be hard for him to make it out. It goes on for miles and miles, who knows what could happen? He doesn't have food, I think, he probably doesn't have anything to hunt unless he stole some ammunition and a rifle from the cargo. Its summer though, so he won't freeze, but the nights still get cold.*

*I shouldn't be worrying about him right now, I need to think about what I should do. Once I disappear they'll know. They're going to send everything after me so this information doesn't get out. Its a risk, however, it could be worth it. Warning Gräsen or Veruckt could save many and stop a greedy conquest before it even comes. Actually that wouldn't stop it, they'd just start sooner. What am I thinking?*

*I do have something to help me escape though,* he looked back at what appeared to just be a regular suitcase, but hidden inside was a gun. *That could help if I needed to defend myself.*

He turned right out of the city limits and onto an open road and sped up. Leaving the city behind him he turned on the radio again, but for music. There was a lot of static as the radio was fairly new, one of the greatest inventions in his opinion. Allowing him to listen to news, radio shows and music. 

The road became quite bumpy after he left the city, it was unpaved and covered in dirt. Many little rock could be a danger to the wheels but he still drove on, watching the scenery pass by him. 

*I forgot to unload the pistol, shit.*

He needed a good place to stop, somewhere where he could be unseen by others passing by. *Where to st-* he was cut off as a big creature stepped out in front of his car and he swerved, his car hit the creatures leg. He rolled, there was so much shaking, he cant stop it how can he stop th- *BANG!* He felt pain in his abdomen, he looked down at the blood gushing from his belly.

*My pistol went off, it went off because it shook so much. Oh no, no..*

He climbed out of his beaten up car and onto the road. His movements were jumpy and janky, making it hard to walk. His sight was blurry, there was glass stabbed into so many parts of his body to the point he wouldn't be able to get them out.

He saw the creature again, red scales, huge wings and smoke coming from its snout. *I- I think I'm going to rest here. No time for hallucinations.*

And he blacked out.

\*\*\*

He looked at the scavenger knowing what he had just done. He had gotten it killed. After crawling out of the weird beaten up metal thing it just layed down and died. This wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t walk out of the trees.

He had noticed the metal box going down this pathway towards him. Inside he noticed there was a scavenger so he walked out to greet it. However, this metal box didn’t stop and it hit his leg quite hard. It felt like dozens of heavy boulders had crashed onto it all at once. 

He couldn’t even walk on it anymore, the pain was just too much.

“Did you just get a scavenger *killed?!*” Hurricane the seawing yelled to his left.

“I didn’t know that would happen! I just saw it in that box thing and walked in front! I don’t know what I was thinking!”

“Well, now we have a *dead body!*” Hurricane yelled back. “What are we going to do? Burn it? Bury it? Find other scavengers? They’re going to know!” 

Thunder just looked at him. *He’s right,* he thought *they’re going to know.*

“Well, how do we know it's dead? It could still be alive.” Thunder said.

Hurricane scoffed, “Won’t it just go find other scavengers once it realizes ‘Oh wait, these are dragons and they kill us.’ Yea, smart thinking there. That is way too much blood to be alive.” He pointed to the red pool.

“Why don’t we just see huh? It’s not like I blasted fire on him.”

“Fine, do whatever you want. But now I have to be near the dragon who just killed a creature we’re not supposed to kill.”

Thunder walked over to the body and placed a talon on it, “Please be alive…” but the body chest didn’t rise or fall. There was no air coming from it’s nose or mouth. 

*Oh moons, I really did just get it killed.*

He then looked towards the metal box. What was that thing? There was nothing pulling it, and yet, it moved. There were no hills going down so it couldn’t have gained any momentum from those. It did have wheels on the bottom, but nothing to move them. He also noticed there was a quiet noise coming from inside of it. He walked over to investigate and listened.

*\[Während das Militär nach Deserteuren sucht, feiern Cerviuns im ganzen Land das jährliche Frühlingsfest. Treffen Sie Cerviuns auf den Straßen und genießen Sie unseren charakteristischen Wein, unser Bier und viele andere alkoholische Getränke. Wir bieten auch verschiedene Fleischsorten an, darunter Rind, Wurst, Hühnchen und Steak. Warten Sie nicht, gehen Sie raus und feiern Sie mit! Aber vergessen Sie dabei nicht, den armen Menschen von Grasen Wohlstand zu wünschen, während sie unter Tyrannei leben.\]*

*Wha- What was that!? It sounds so similar, yet different to dragon. It didn’t even sound clear, and there is nothing around to make that noise.*

He looked back at the dead body. It was still unbreathing. He started digging a hole in some soft dirt by the side of the path. He could at least bury it to show he was sorry.

“So you’re burying it,” Thunder looked at Hurricane. “Now let’s go. We don’t want to be seen here.”

Thunder nodded and finished his burial. He started walking through the forest. He couldn’t fly or else that would attract scavengers near the area. There was still fresh blood in that area.

*1234*

He counted his steps.

*1234*

It helped pass the time.



*1234*

*Wait, that metal box is still there. Are scavengers used to those things? If they are, that is a definite sign of something happening.*

He looked back at his leg it crashed into, it was throbbing with pain and it was hard to walk. He continued on.

*Should we go back? Is it worth it to go back? Oh moons, we shouldn’t have left it.*

Hurricane! We left that metal box thing, we have to go back! Thunder shouted at him. 

Hurricane looked at him angrily. “Really?! Come on! Go get it then! Don’t just stand there!”

Thunder scrambled back towards the path and metal box. Ignoring the pain in his foot, he started running. It hurt a lot of course, but not enough to stop him.  

*Please let there be no scavengers, or dragons.*

He arrived at the site once again, but there were scavengers. They were wearing a shiny, green, turtle shell looking thing.

*\[Was zur Hölle war das? Was ist das?\]*

They were making the same noises from the box. They must be connected.

*\[Oh, was zum Teufel? Sieht aus wie ein Drache, aber die gibt es nicht, oder? Erschieß ihn!\]*

The other scavenger nodded and pulled a long stick from its back, *What is that stick going to do?* Well, the stick in question made a loud crack noise, and then there was even more pain in his leg. It felt so sharp, and so small, but it was so painful

There were more sharp cracks until his knees buckled under him, blood pooling from tiny holes in his legs.

*\[Fesselt ihn! Seid vorsichtig, ich erschieße ihn, wenn er irgendetwas versucht!\]*

\*\*\*

“Görvan! The mighty dragon killer! Tell us, how did you find such a creature!” Asked the drunken Merkel on his left, his breath reeked of alcohol. 

“You were there! Why are you asking?” Görvan asked the drunken man. 

“I just want you to tell the rest of us!” Merkel said.

“Oh, fine! Let’s get on with it then!” Görvan stated, “I was walking through the woods with this drunken buffoon named Merkel, on a regular hunting trip. We were hoping to get lucky with some deer, or some bear. But some rustling from the bushes and we see those scaly creatures.” He continued on, “Of course, the first thing me and Merkel did was pull our rifles out. We aimed for their heads, we didn’t want to risk too much. But even then, it took a couple shots because Merkel can’t hit anything.” Görvan threw at his friend.

“Am not!” Merkel said with his voice slurred.

Görvan sighed, “Anyways, one of them got into the air and we shot as much as we could. That damn thing got away, but now we have those dragons. I gave them to the scientists.” Görvan didn’t say anything else, only his thoughts making noise.

*I wonder if there are more…*

We didn’t chat much on the app, but he was straightforward and asked me out for coffee right away. I told him I’d prefer to get to know him a little better first, but he insisted—we had to meet soon since he was heading back to Manila for work.

When we finally met, I was pleasantly surprised. He was easy to talk to, charming even. Tall, fair-skinned, and incredibly smart. After coffee, we decided to find another place to continue our conversation, and time flew by effortlessly.

The next day, he texted me, asking if I had any plans. If not, he invited me to join him on some errands. Sounds like the beginning of something promising, right? Hold on… the twist is coming.

We continued texting after that. Nothing intense, but enough to tell each other we missed each other’s company. I started to like him—he had everything I could ask for: smart, career-driven, tall, and handsome. He made sense, you know? I could even see myself falling for him.

But then life threw a curveball.

I was selected for a prestigious scholarship program. Only six applicants from the Philippines were chosen—and guess what? One of them was his ex-girlfriend. Of all the people!

As fate would have it, I ended up becoming friends with his ex. And that’s when the truth came out. He was a father of four—each child with a different mother. Let that sink in: FOUR kids. THREE mothers. Major red flag. 🚩

But looking back, I realize it was divine intervention. Maybe God was watching out for me, saving me from something I didn’t see coming.

So, no, don’t tell me I haven’t tried putting myself out there. I did. It’s just that maybe—just maybe—relationships aren’t meant for me right now. And you know what? That’s okay.

For now, I’ll take the lessons, the laughs, and the near misses, and keep moving forward.

Nanay’s training has rewired me to see sayang in every corner of my adult life.

- Scolding my family members with recycled Nanay lines...

The words just come out of nowhere. ""hindi ka papasa diyan kung TikTok nang TikTok!"" or ""Kung may oras kang maglaro, may oras kang magligpit."" Honestly, sometimes I scare myself.

- The tito moves are strong...

I’ve caught myself:

Offering guests tubig at crackers the moment they sit down.

Owning a massive collection of recycled ice cream tubs... for ulam storage.

I even have a system - maliit para sa sawsawan, medium for leftover rice, tapos malaking tub for sinigang. Kaya minsan, imbes na dessert, ulam ang inaasahan kapag may ""Magnolia"" sa ref.

- Turning off the electric fan while yelling, ‘hindi ka ba nilalamig?’

This one hits different. You truly become a Nanay clone when you start obsessing over the electric bill more than Netflix.

Honestly, I used to think adulting was about being cool and independent. Turns out, it’s about making sure there’s rice at home and panicking over ""due date na pala ng meralco!"" But you know what? I see now that everything my Nanay did - no matter how nakakainis it felt before - was her way of keeping the house (and us kids) together.

So yeah, I’m turning into my nanay. And honestly? That’s the kind of adult I’m okay with becoming.",9,1732861391.0,adultingph,0,1.0,False

Big horror/sci fi guy. A few animated ones too. 
But mostly we will be watching any movie both of us like, except romance/drama movies. I’m sad enough. 

And if you like coffee, currently I’m collecting stamps. We can do that too. 

Prefer someone who is actually into movies, can do 7pm to 9pm movie slots because it’s too hot during the day. 

Please don’t hesitate to send me a DM. Vibe check sa ta. Planning to watch Wicked this Sunday. ",3,1732860978.0,cdoR4Friends,1,1.0,False
