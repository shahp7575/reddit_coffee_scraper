*Looking for the largest Global Biscuit Manufacturers? Bakemate is the*¬†[*largest Chocolate Manufacturers*¬†](https://bakemate.in/chocolates)*in the world, offers delicious chocolates, Biscuits, Cookies, Candies, Lollipops, Wafers, and many more*.

Chocolate wafer rolls are a delicious treat made by wrapping a thin, crisp wafer around a creamy, chocolatey centre. They‚Äôre often enjoyed as a snack on their own or as a delightful addition to desserts like ice cream. Their light, crunchy exterior combined with the rich chocolate filling makes them a popular choice worldwide.

Chocolate wafer rolls are a popular snack made from thin, crispy wafers rolled into tubes, usually filled with a creamy chocolate centre. They offer a satisfying blend of textures ‚Äî crisp wafers with a smooth, rich filling ‚Äî and are often used as a garnish for ice cream, coffee drinks, or desserts. The flavour combination of chocolate and wafer creates a sweet yet light treat, making them enjoyable as a standalone snack or as a decorative addition to dessert presentations.

Chocolate wafer rolls come in many varieties, appealing to diverse tastes and occasions. Here‚Äôs a deeper look into their unique qualities and uses:

1. **Flavour Varieties**: Though chocolate is a classic filling, wafer rolls also come with other flavours like hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, mocha, or even fruity fillings. Some versions have double or triple fillings, blending flavours like chocolate-hazelnut or chocolate-strawberry, creating layered taste experiences.
2. **Texture Appeal**: The contrast between the light, crispy wafer and the smooth, creamy filling is one of the main draws. The wafer shell, made from a mixture of flour, sugar, and oil, is baked thinly and rolled tightly to achieve a delicate crispness.
3. **Serving Suggestions**: Wafer rolls are often served alongside coffee, hot chocolate, or ice cream. They‚Äôre great for dipping into coffee or milk, and the crispy texture softens slightly for a pleasant mouthfeel. They‚Äôre also widely used to top desserts like sundaes, cakes, or puddings for an extra decorative and flavourful element.
4. **Gifting and Festivities**: Chocolate wafer rolls are frequently packaged in elegant tins or boxes, making them popular for gifting during holidays and celebrations. Some gourmet versions include premium chocolate or are covered with an outer chocolate coating, adding a touch of indulgence.
5. **Storage and Freshness**: To keep their texture crisp, wafer rolls should be stored in airtight containers and kept away from humidity. Once opened, they maintain the best flavour and crunch if consumed within a few days.

# 1. Manufacturing Process

* **Wafer Preparation**: The wafer mix, usually made from wheat flour, sugar, and emulsifiers, is poured into a high-temperature baking mould, creating a thin, crispy sheet.
* **Rolling and Filling**: The sheet is quickly rolled while still warm to form a hollow tube. After cooling, the tubes are filled with chocolate cream using an injection process that ensures even distribution of the filling.
* **Packaging**: Wafer rolls are typically packed in foil-lined containers or tins to preserve their crispness and prevent moisture absorption.

# 2. Global Popularity and Cultural Variations

* **Asia**: In countries like Japan and Thailand, wafer rolls often feature unique fillings such as matcha (green tea), taro, or red bean. They‚Äôre enjoyed as a light snack and sometimes paired with green tea or traditional desserts.
* **Europe**: Italy and France offer wafer rolls as a classic treat with espresso or gelato. Some varieties even incorporate liquor flavors, giving them a gourmet twist.
* **Latin America**: In places like Mexico, wafer rolls are often dipped in chocolate or sprinkled with chili powder for a spicy kick, reflecting local flavor preferences.

# Flavor Variations and Types

¬∑¬†**Double-Filled Rolls**: Some varieties feature multiple fillings, like chocolate-hazelnut or chocolate-caramel, for layered flavors.

¬∑¬†**Coated Rolls**: Higher-end options might have an extra coating of chocolate on the outside, sometimes sprinkled with nuts, sea salt, or coconut.

¬∑¬†**Health-Conscious Options**: Many brands now offer low-sugar, gluten-free, or dairy-free versions to meet different dietary preferences.

Through Reddit‚Äôs developer platform, moderators are able to add and install apps that add new *tools* or *utilities* to their toolbox*.* In this article, we will go over some of the most popular developer platform *tool and utility* apps.¬†¬†¬†

When you install a developer platform app that is mod-facing, new menu options may become available to your entire mod team, so be sure to discuss these installations with your team first. These can sometimes be found in the mod shield button and then scrolling down.¬†¬†

Depending on the app you install, you may have configuration options appear. Read them well and take your time adjusting it to your team‚Äôs specific needs. You may also want to test out an app in a test subreddit first.

Lastly, installing an app will add a mod account to your community automatically. Don‚Äôt worry, these are not human, but part of what makes these apps work on your subreddit. You will need full moderator permissions to install an app.  


**Four Popular Mod Tool Apps That Are Easy to Set Up**¬†

* [**Comment Mop**](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/comment-nuke) **TLDR: Trim and tame comment branches easily**¬†

Has a comment branch derailed a conversation into unwanted territory? Or has one gone on for way too long? If you want to remove or lock a parent comment and all of the comments under it, this app helps you do so in a few clicks!¬†

When removing content this way, be very careful since you will likely not be reading the entire list of removed comments. Users will not see Removal Reasons and may write to you wondering what they did wrong. It may help to leave a single removal reason in the parent comment explaining the removal.

[Comment Mop](https://preview.redd.it/5rqns3gy2t0e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d174031d90acc9ad652525fa0bd9b6fe89a40bd)

* [**Remove Macro**](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/purge-user) **TLDR: Remove all content from a user with an optional ban in 2 clicks**

Mods can‚Äôt see everything, and you may discover a user that has a long history of rule-breaking content that made it past your radar. Removing it all manually can be a breeze with this app!

This app is very powerful and also requires a lot of care. Removing so much content in bulk can remove some very valuable content from your community. It will also make it near impossible to re-approve all the removed content if you decide to reverse this action.

In addition, it also allows you to ban the user as part of the process.¬†

* [**ModMail Automoderator**](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/auto-modmail) **TLDR: automates a modmail inbox as needed**

Have you ever thought to yourself: ‚ÄúWe get too many incoming Mod Mail messages about the same topics?‚Äù A simple rule configuration can help. The [default suggested in the ModMail Automoderator wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/fsvapps/wiki/auto-modmail/#wiki_responding_to_ban_appeals_from_users_who_aren.27t_banned.) is helpful as a starting point.¬†

Don‚Äôt forget your goals when creating these automations. If a redditor is confused, you may be setting yourselves up to even longer conversations, defeating the purpose of the automation in the first place.

It‚Äôs important to remember how redditors will perceive these messages. Some automated messages, like an initial one reminding users of your response times, can make redditors have a better experience. Others can frustrate them and escalate a situation. Review how your responses are received before setting up auto-archiving.

* [**Flair Assistant**](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/flairassistant) **TLDR: Run actions (locking, banning, messaging, ignoring and more) automatically by assigning flair to a post.**

Who doesn‚Äôt love being able to make advanced actions in two clicks?

Flair Assistant lets you trigger many different optional actions by simply applying Post Flair ‚Äì such as: Approve, Remove (with removal reason), Spam, Ignore Reports, Lock, Ban User, Comment, Edit User or Post Flair, or Add a Mod Note.

After setting it up, your entire team will be able to make moderation actions faster. It‚Äôs powerful if you take the time to set it up properly.¬†

I can't stress this one enough. If you disregard everything else in this post, just do this one and you'll see the game was intended to be played this way. So many game mechanics are all of a sudden useful and have a purpose in the world. So again, no tonics of any kind. You snooze, you lose.

Only the first 4 squares in your satchel (provisions tab) can be used and can only hold 1 of each item. This can be anything from a bottle of booze to an apple for your horse to smokes, choose wisely. You're allowed to have up to a pack of smokes and about five cigars. 

If you pick something up that you shouldn't have, simply discard it immediately. The nice thing about the game is that the items disappear.

No crafting ingredients of any kind, like herbs etc. Ingredients like coffee is allowed, but you're only allowed one. You have to buy everything at the store. If you're hungry. Eat a meal at the Saloon, or Kill an animal and eat your fill. But you have to discard the leftover raw meat because technically raw meat's not going to last long in your satchel. Neither is cooked meat. You can only cook what you will eat at the campfire. This can be anything from fish to bear meat. Whatever your fancy. 

You can keep animal pelts because they get stored on your horse and any other ingredients you get from the animal parts. You're allowed to keep those for crafting or selling. 

You have to store all of your weapons in your weapon locker and only equip two sidearms and two primary. Choose wisely. Hint, always take the bow. Depends on what your goals are for the session I suppose.

No looting fallen enemies. You just killed a bunch of people. You're not going to hang around and loot every single body. Plus it's usually a waste of time anyways. 

No fast travel unless you pay money for it.

Turn aim assist to free aim.

And finally, for the love of RDR don't use deadeye. If your playing on console simply rebind the R3 to the left bumper or something. I've had so many tense moments because of this simple change. The only time you can use deadeye is if you use the dual feature by slowly squeezing the trigger. You can use this to your advantage however you will also lose the ability to paint targets, keeping it real guys.

I have made space for the gym in my life again and have around 30-45mins 2-3x per week (depending how fast i drink my coffee)

I am going for lifting over CV in an effort to build some muscle, partially to look good, primarily to build good habits and stay mobile for longer in life.

I do, all to fail or as close as i dare without a spotter:

Arm day, curls, 3x10
1 arm bent over row 3x10
Dumbell press 3x10
Kettlebell swing to fail usually around 40-50
If extra time i will do calf raises as they seem to take it

Leg day

Weighted squats 3x10
Calf raises 3x10-14
Leg extension 3x10
Kettlebell to fail around 40

The 3rd day is core usually and doesn't happen as much as I would like.

Please let me know what changes you would make. The hard limit is the time unfortunately, I do also have to go and work a fairly physical job immediately after a shower too

Since he's never been dangerous, I've just kind of let it be. But recently my wife has become convinced that he's autistic. I just thought he had severe social anxiety. His brother (my uncle) was the nicest, coolest, friendliest guy, but my dad was so strange.

Here are a few notes about him. Does this sound like a guy with autism?

It had it's cosmetic flaws and needed some maintenance done along the way but nothing major until about 4 months ago. We were heading down to a store and pulled into the parking lot when the truck started jittering and suddenly a lot of smoke from was coming from under the hood. He shut it off quickly, opened the hood, and was met with a small fire. My mom had a coffee in her hand and doused the fire with it in a panic. Luckily we weren't too far from home so we got it towed to our local mechanic down the street. He determined it was the ignition coil in cylinder 1. I had previously replaced the ignition coils with some Chinese brand ones back in 2021. In hindsight this wasn't the smartest idea and i did feel guilty for using those once i heard it was the coils. The mechanic replaced the coil in cylinder 1 with a coil we got from Autozone and recommended we replace the rest ASAP. I purchased 5 more ignition coils and replaced them myself the next day. Everything seemed fine and we believed we had solved the issue. 2 weeks later we were on a 5 hour road trip and after arriving to our destination, the truck starts jittering again. This time no smoke or fire but we didn't want to risk any further damage so we took it to a local shop. They also replaced the ignition coil in cylinder 1 and said we were good. Obviously, being 5 hours away from home made us very cautious on the drive back home. But to our surprise the vehicle made it home without any hiccups. About a week later, the jittering starts again but makes it home and a mechanic comes by the next day. He checked all the wiring, harnesses, and any other electrical components that he suspected. Only thing he suggested was to replace the ignition coil once again and get a new ignition coil harness. Of course about 2 weeks later, the truck starts jittering again and catches fire in the exact same spot for a second time. This time the truck was about an hour from home and had to be towed again. Of course by this point we know a simple ignition coil swap isn't going to do the job. We replace the harness again since the fire melted it and also replace the coil with a Z1 VQ40DE High Energy ignition coil which the mechanic suggested. I also put a thread chaser down the spark plug hole to clean out the threads. Forgot to mention a little nipple on the radiator broke during one of these fiascos so as soon as I replace the radiator, I'll take this thing on a test drive and hope for the best and keep my fire extinguisher in the cup holder. I'm not a mechanic. Just a guy willing to try some repairs with simple tools, Youtube, and a less experienced friend or two. Any help is appreciated.

1gqy5vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1gqy5vw/the_kitchen_matrix/,The kitchen matrix,"So this is a random thing that occasionally happens in our kitchen and kitchen only. I have adhd and ocd and am very particular when it comes to the kitchen and how it is organized. When we bought our house we agreed I would dictate what happened in the kitchen and he could do what he wanted in the backyard, the rest of the house had a mutual agreement clause. 

Anyhow, I cook a lot. It‚Äôs literally one of the few hyper fixation hobbies I started that ever really stuck.  There‚Äôs a few other in rotation, but I digress. 
I have this weird thing with brands and only buy OXO equipment. That being said I have a variety of whisks and other utensils. I have a mini whisk that I love and use for so many small dishes, eggs, broths, coffee(weird I know). Again it‚Äôs a weird adhd ocd thing. My husband cooks breakfast for himself often as I‚Äôm often out of the house by the time he rises. I will wash the dishes and put them away if time permits. Another fun ocd tick. 

We both use this tiny whisk daily for multiple things and are very sure we put it back when we‚Äôre done. We had a few busy weeks and were out on weekends, going to brunch, soccer games, basketball games, various events, mostly kid centric. The weekends slowed down  and we went back to a more house central timeline. So Saturday morning we get up and start prepping for breakfast and can not for the life of me find the damn whisk. Weeks go by, I deep clean and reorganize the kitchen trying in vain to find the whisk. No luck. 

This has happened with a few other things but nothing as pressing as the stupid mini whisk we use all the time. Large ice cube tray, gone, one single small spoon out of a set of 24, etc. anyhow I conceded to the loss of the stupid little whisk and braved Target to buy a new one. I got the new one home, washed it and put it in the drawer. 

Hours later I‚Äôm in the kitchen having a casual convo with my husband while we prep dinner. I go to the drawer with the whisks and lo and behold there are two of the same whisks, one obviously new and one with a bit of wear and discoloration from washing in the dishwasher.

 Cue both of us staring in shock at one another. WTF? How the hell, the drawer has six whisks and three sets of tongs. There is no way the damn thing could have been looked over. The drawer swallowed it, hung onto it and spit it back out when we moved on and bought a new one. 

Still missing the ice cube tray, but we have a full set of 24 little spoons, except the one that disappeared came back in the form of a soup spoon, wider and deeper. I can only explain this as a weird glitch in the matrix or possibly a worm hole? I am baffled and so is my husband. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my glitch story, it feels good to get it out of my mind. Oh yeah the old whisk broke at the handle about a week after it came back. I‚Äôll never know and it‚Äôs going to drive me crazy. I guess that thought will be a new hyper fixation that joins the rotation. ",1,1731563433.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,0.67,False

I loved catching up with you and seeing your beautiful baby. Reminiscing and laughing together was so comforting. Like pulling out an old sweater and sliding it on-it didn‚Äôt quite fit the same but the same love was there. 

I hope you didn‚Äôt take offense to me not being overly excited about hanging out. I remember how intuitive you are and, to be honest, it caught me off guard when you asked for my new number and then pressed for us to grab coffee a handful of times. While my heart would love nothing more than to erase the years and rift between us and go giggle over a cup of coffee with our babies like we had always dreamed of doing when we were young, you do not know the woman I am now, and she has changed too much to be your friend. 

The woman I am now has healed from the hurt that was between us. She is smart and intuitive and recognizes that our friendship can never be a safe space because of the loyalty demanded of you by others. I know too much, and hold myself to a standard of friendship that is not available to us because of the unhealed person in your life. And unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think that is ever going to change. I was used as the scapegoat, and you were used as the backstabber. And the person who used us both is part of your daily life, and is still so unhealed that despite haunting the edges of my life-she is unable to look me in the eye or turn her face in my direction without a scowl. I don‚Äôt blame you or have any negative feelings towards you, but I will not choose to reinsert myself into a friendship that is ferociously unsafe because of the loyalty required of you. I respect that you honored your loyalties, I only wish she had not forced you to choose between her or me. I was never a threat, but family is always the only choice. 

So the next time you grab a coffee or order a bento box with extra sauce, think of me fondly and know that I do the same. While I wasn‚Äôt at your wedding or baby shower or birthday, know that I am always sending warm wishes your way.

1gqy36v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1gqy36v/to_my_fellow_indians_dreaming_of_moving/,To My Fellow Indians Dreaming of Moving Abroad-Please Reconsider,"Hello friends,

I know the appeal of moving to a foreign country like the UK, Canada, US, or Germany is strong. You see the glamorous social media posts of friends who‚Äôve ‚Äúmade it‚Äù abroad, and maybe you‚Äôve heard agents paint an amazing picture of life overseas. But as someone familiar with the reality, I want to tell you: please rethink your decision before making the leap.

Here‚Äôs the truth that‚Äôs often left out in those social media highlights and immigration brochures:

1. Your Culture and Beliefs May Not Be Fully Accepted

It‚Äôs easy to assume that you‚Äôll be able to practice your religion or live by your cultural values just as freely. The reality can be much more complicated. Certain behaviors, norms, and practices that feel natural in India might be misunderstood, even viewed negatively, abroad. This can create a subtle but real sense of being an outsider.

2. Qualifications Often Don‚Äôt Transfer

Even if you graduated from a top Indian university with a high GPA, you‚Äôll likely need to take more courses, certifications, or even licensing exams to work in your field abroad. And that‚Äôs after spending thousands just to get there! Many people find themselves either taking exams and courses endlessly, or accepting roles that don‚Äôt match their experience or qualifications.

3. The Salary Is Not What It Seems After Taxes and Expenses

Yes, the monthly salary in foreign currency looks impressive compared to the Indian rupee. But once you account for high taxes, rent, and cost of living, the disposable income isn‚Äôt that much. If you plan to support a family or live independently, costs skyrocket quickly. You‚Äôll often find yourself struggling, not saving as much as you dreamed.

4. Permanent Residency Isn‚Äôt Easy or Guaranteed

The ultimate goal for many is to get PR, thinking it will lead to stability and security. But PR applications are tougher than ever. With high demand from all over the world, wait times and costs are increasing. This means countless hours, sleepless nights, and an emptying bank account for a chance that is no longer guaranteed.

5. A Tarnished Reputation Due to a Few Bad Actors

Unfortunately, the actions of a small number of Indians using fake documents or engaging in illegal activities have damaged the community‚Äôs reputation. We are increasingly seen with suspicion, and that‚Äôs a tough label to shake when you‚Äôre already struggling to fit in.

6. Language Barriers and Cultural Differences Can Be Overwhelming

Many find it difficult to communicate or stand up for themselves in the workplace. Language differences and lack of confidence can make even routine tasks a challenge. You might face situations where you‚Äôre treated unfairly or sidelined but can‚Äôt express yourself well enough to push back.

7. Reality vs. Expectations in the Job Market

Many end up working in low-wage jobs like in coffee shops, supermarkets, or as Uber drivers, even if they had respectable jobs back home. It‚Äôs not that these jobs are shameful, but they‚Äôre often not what you pictured for yourself when you dreamed of moving abroad. And with rising racism and tension, these opportunities are shrinking too.

8. It‚Äôs Easy to End Up Lonely and Regretful

Many who move abroad face a loneliness that is hard to describe. Despite social media posts, the reality is often hours of isolation, missing your family, and facing unfamiliar environments. Over time, you may realize the sacrifice is too high, and the financial gains aren‚Äôt as great as you thought. Regret and loneliness become constant companions for many who make this move.

In Closing: Don‚Äôt Fall for the Trap

I‚Äôm not saying no one should go abroad. If you‚Äôre truly ready for the struggle and have a clear reason, it‚Äôs your choice. But please don‚Äôt let social media or agents‚Äô promises lure you into a situation that could leave you in debt, alone, and far from everything familiar.

Take the time to deeply understand the reality before deciding. Often, staying home and building a life with less glamour but more genuine connections can be worth so much more than an uncertain dream abroad.

Then two weeks later I went over there and we spent the day with each other and I spent the night again and this time we did hook up. Now I‚Äôm just feeling not very good about myself (not because of him he has a huge dick and knows how to use it ;)) but because that‚Äôs now my 12th body. I feel like that‚Äôs kinda high. I just don‚Äôt want to feel like I give it up easy, but apparently I do. I told myself that after my ex and I ended things that I was going to take things really slow and not rush into things sexually with anyone else unless I am really sure about the next person. But I think I am really sure about this guy. Does having 12 people for a body count make me a slut?",0,1731562802.0,Vent,7,0.5,False

It all happened while I was on my way to visit my parents for some time away from the big city. My parents were always country folk who always loved to be out on the middle of the wilderness. As I was driving through the highway, it started to rain a little. Nothing I didn‚Äôt really worry about. Tank was still full of gas, my music was on, it could have been much worse. But it did. Me and my big mouth right? My car ended making noises that didn‚Äôt sound normal. As in it didn‚Äôt sound like a car should be if it was working properly. I wasn‚Äôt an expert on cars, but something told me to pull over. 


I ended up kicking my car in frustration as I exhausted pretty much all of my options on trying to get it moving again. I ended up realizing that I had to start walking, maybe find someone who could help me with this. 


I couldn‚Äôt call my parents because my cellphone had no service. I was in the middle of nowhere. 


I had to hurry and maybe find someplace I could spend the night, maybe when the rain cleared up, I could sort out this car problem in the morning. 


After what seemed like hours of walking, I saw it. 


The hotel sat on a lonely stretch of highway, a flickering neon sign casting a sickly glow on the empty parking lot. At this point, I was desperate; my car had broken down miles from the nearest town, and the rain had turned into a downpour that had me soaked to the bone. Through the sheets of rain, the hotel loomed like a dark bruise on the side of the road, and I had no choice but to seek refuge. They always say hindsight is twenty twenty. But desperate people do desperate things. 


Inside, the place was even worse. The lobby was dim, smelling of mildew and something faintly metallic. The old woman at the front desk handed me a key with a smile that never reached her eyes, murmuring, ‚ÄúRoom 13. The only one we have tonight.‚Äù


‚ÄúThanks. It‚Äôll do.‚Äù 



Room 13.


The number stuck to my mind. It felt unsettling, but I was exhausted and cold, I had no time to be picky or nervous. I just wanted to sleep. The room itself was no better than the lobby‚Äîbare bulbs hung from the ceiling, and the wallpaper peeled in long strips, revealing dark stains underneath. But it was a bed, and at that point, I would have slept anywhere.


I tossed most of my wet clothes onto the floor, climbed under the covers, and closed my eyes, trying not to think about the faint, sour smell wafting up from the mattress.


I hadn‚Äôt been asleep long when the scratching started.


At first, it was faint. I thought it might have been the wind rattling against the old windows or maybe an animal crawling around in the walls. I rolled over, pulling the pillow over my head, but the scratching grew louder. It was coming from under the bed. That‚Äôs when I started to get a bit creeped out. 


The sound was too deliberate, too precise to be an animal. I told myself not to look, to stay in bed and ignore it. But as soon as I thought that, the scratching stopped.


A few seconds later, the bed shifted. I was shaking slightly from the sudden movement. 


It wasn‚Äôt much, just a faint movement, like something‚Äîor someone‚Äîwas pushing up from underneath. I felt my stomach tighten as I lay completely still, hoping that whatever was down there didn‚Äôt know I was awake. But then, just as I began to relax, I heard a whisper.


‚ÄúCome closer.‚Äù


I squeezed my eyes shut, barely able to breathe. The whisper came again, rasping and dry, like paper tearing in two. ‚ÄúCome closer, I need to tell you something.‚Äù


I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It felt like ice was filling my veins, freezing me in place.


Then came a long, drawn-out sigh from beneath the bed, followed by a low, mocking laugh.


‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll come closer.‚Äù


The bed lurched, slamming hard enough to lift me up, and that was it‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I leapt out, scrambling toward the door, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. My hands were shaking too hard to turn the lock. I fumbled, feeling the growing pressure behind me, like someone standing close enough to touch. But before I could turn around, I heard the voice again, louder this time, whispering right next to my ear.


‚ÄúI just wanted you to know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not your bed you‚Äôre sleeping in.‚Äù


My breath caught, my heart hammering as I stumbled backward, tripping over my own feet. I fell against the bed, half-expecting to feel something clawing at me from underneath, but there was nothing there. Just silence and the dead, stale air of the room.


In a panic, I ripped open the closet door, desperate for a place to hide. My mind raced‚ÄîI had no phone, no working phone,no way to call for help, and the rain still hammered down outside, isolating me further.


I crouched in the closet, heart pounding, trying to calm my breathing. But then I noticed the smell‚Äîa thick, cloying odor. It was metallic and wet, stronger now that I was in the closet.


My stomach twisted as I looked down. There, on the floor, was a dark, sticky stain. It pooled beneath a pair of feet, their skin pale and mottled, visible under a tattered dress that hung from the figure like dead leaves.


It was a woman, her face twisted in a silent scream, her arms contorted at unnatural angles. She stared straight ahead, her glassy eyes unseeing‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs what I thought.


As I watched, her eyes flicked to mine, the corners of her mouth stretching into a grin.


And she whispered, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like it when you hide.‚Äù


I stumbled backward out of the closet, my whole body screaming to run, but I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off her. She was still smiling that awful, silent grin that seemed like it was stretching wider. Her lifeless eyes locked onto mine. My heart pounded as I backed away, feeling my way toward the door. But when my hand reached the knob, I found it was ice-cold‚Äîso cold it burned.


The air in the room was thick, almost suffocating, as if something was pressing down from every direction. I forced myself to look away from her, to try the lock again, but my fingers were stiff and clumsy from the cold. I twisted and pulled, but the lock wouldn‚Äôt budge, no matter how hard I yanked.


I was trapped. I was beyond terrified. 


A shuffling sound echoed from the closet. I didn‚Äôt want to turn around, but some part of me had to. Against every ounce of common sense, I glanced over my shoulder.


The woman in the closet was moving. She was crawling toward me, inch by inch. Her twisted arms scraping against the floor, her eyes wide and empty. As she dragged herself forward, her broken fingers left dark streaks in her wake, a trail of blood or something darker.


‚ÄúI tried to leave, too,‚Äù she hissed, her voice raw and brittle, as if it hadn‚Äôt been used in years. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt let you go. He keeps you here.‚Äù


I backed into the corner near the door, feeling the wall cold and rough against my spine. My throat felt tight, my whole body locked in place as I watched her draw closer. Her eyes, hollow and sunken had bore into me, full of something I couldn‚Äôt understand‚Äîrage, desperation, maybe even hunger.


Then, just inches from my feet, she stopped.


Her head jerked upward, and I felt a chill crawl down my spine as her gaze shifted, not at me but at something behind me.


‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here,‚Äù she whispered, a shiver in her voice. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always watching.‚Äù


I wanted to scream, to get out of this nightmare, but a noise stopped me‚Äîa soft creak, like the slow groan of a door opening. I forced myself to turn, and there, in the shadowed corner of the room, I saw it.


A figure. Tall and impossibly thin, with limbs too long and bent in the wrong places, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. It was draped in tattered black cloth which clung to its form like a shroud. Its face‚Ä¶ it had no face. Just a smooth, pale surface, featureless but somehow filled with malice.


The figure didn‚Äôt move. It simply stood there, a cold, hollow presence that sucked the air from the room. But then, slowly, it raised one hand, pointing a single, bony finger directly at me.


‚ÄúHe‚Äôs chosen you,‚Äù the woman rasped, her eyes wide with fear. She was backing away now, retreating into the darkness of the closet. ‚ÄúHe always chooses someone. And once he chooses, he never lets go.‚Äù


‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, the word barely audible. ‚ÄúNo. Say away from me! No!‚Äù 


But the figure took a step forward, the room growing colder with each movement, the walls seeming to close in. I could feel it pulling at me, dragging me toward it, like an invisible hand clutching at my chest. My legs gave out, and I fell to my knees, staring up at that faceless horror as it loomed over me. The I saw what looked like it‚Äôs mouth open. It didn‚Äôt just open, it tore it open as if it were ripping open its very flesh. It was open in a silent scream. 


Then, in a voice that sounded like nails scraping over glass, it spoke.


‚ÄúStay,‚Äù it said, the word echoing, filling the room. ‚ÄúStay‚Ä¶ forever.‚Äù


My body went rigid, every nerve screaming to run, but I couldn‚Äôt move. I was frozen in place, trapped under that thing‚Äôs gaze‚Äîor whatever it was that served as its gaze. The shadows around me deepened, and I felt a weight pressing down on my chest, making it harder and harder to breathe.


I tried to scream, to call for help, but no sound came out. The room spun, darkness creeping in at the edges of my vision, and just before I blacked out, I heard one last whisper, so faint I could barely make it out.


‚ÄúRoom 13 always needs a guest.‚Äù


When I woke up, everything was quiet. I was lying in the middle of the floor, the stale smell of the room thick in my nose. My head ached, and every inch of my body felt like it had been crushed under a rock. For a brief moment, I thought maybe I‚Äôd dreamed it all, that it had been some kind of feverish nightmare.


But then I looked around and the room was empty‚Äîno twisted woman, no faceless figure. But the door was wide open, and outside, I could see the early light of dawn peaking through the old hotel windows. 


I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I scrambled to my feet, every instinct screaming to get out. My clothes were still damp, my car was still broken down, but I didn‚Äôt care. I sprinted out of the room, down the narrow hallway, through the lobby, and into the rain-soaked parking lot.


As I stumbled toward the road, I glanced back.


The hotel loomed behind me, dark and silent, its sign flickering in the dawn light. But there, in the doorway, I saw a figure standing, watching me.


It was the old woman from the front desk.


She raised a hand, giving me a slow, sad wave, and in that moment, I saw her face clearly for the first time. She looked like the woman from the closet‚Äîolder, perhaps, but unmistakably the same. Her eyes were hollow, empty, as if there was nothing behind them. She had that same smile that seemed just as hollow. 


And as I turned away, a chill ran down my spine, because I swear I heard her whisper, drifting through the cold morning air.


‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be ready for you‚Ä¶ whenever you decide to come back.‚Äù


I didn‚Äôt look back. I broke into a full sprint. 


I kept running. I didn‚Äôt stop until I was well down the highway, legs shaking, lungs burning. The sun was rising, casting long shadows across the empty road. My mind was a blur, replaying every horrific detail, every sound, every face.


Finally, a car pulled over‚Äîa beat-up pickup with a grizzled old driver who took one look at my drenched clothes and haunted expression, and without a word, opened the passenger door.


‚ÄúTrouble?‚Äù he asked as I climbed in, trying to catch my breath.


‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I managed, voice hoarse. ‚ÄúBroke down. Stayed at‚Ä¶ some hotel.‚Äù I realized I didn‚Äôt even know its name. 


He didn‚Äôt say anything for a minute, eyes on the road. Then he asked, almost too casually, ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt have been the old highway hotel, would it? Little ways back? Place with the busted-up neon sign?‚Äù


I felt a shiver roll over me and nodded. How did he know? 


He sucked in a breath. ‚ÄúDamn shame,‚Äù he muttered under his breath, shaking his head. ‚ÄúFolks around here stay far from that place.‚Äù


I wanted to ask what he meant, wanted to know if he‚Äôd ever seen‚Ä¶ whatever it was that I‚Äôd seen. But the words stuck in my throat, and after a few minutes of silence, I felt myself slipping into an uneasy sleep, exhausted from the night before. 


I woke up with a deep yawn. We were parked outside a small gas station on what seemed like the edge of a small town. The driver was talking to a mechanic, pointing toward my broken-down car, which he‚Äôd somehow managed to tow while I slept. He gestured to me to get out, handing me an old thermos of coffee before saying, ‚ÄúThis is as far as I go, kid. You‚Äôd do well to get in that car and keep going. Some places ain‚Äôt worth visiting.‚Äù


I nodded, barely able to manage a thank you, and watched as he drove off, leaving me in a town I‚Äôd never been to before. The mechanic gave me a sympathetic look as he worked on my car, and for a long time, neither of us said anything. But just as he finished up, he glanced at me, a strange, unreadable look in his eyes.


‚ÄúYou know, that hotel‚Ä¶ Place‚Äôs been closed for decades. Your friend told me about it. You should count yourself lucky. Not many people drive down that highway.‚Äù 


I froze, my stomach dropping. ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù I stammered. ‚ÄúI was just there last night. There was a woman at the desk. I got a room.‚Äù


He gave me a wary look, like he‚Äôd heard this before. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised how many folks ‚Äòstay‚Äô there, thinking it‚Äôs real. I‚Äôve heard stories like yours a dozen times over. Trust me kid, whatever you think you saw in there was not real.‚Äù 


I felt a chill wash over me. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what happened there?‚Äù I forced myself to ask.


The mechanic glanced around, as if he didn‚Äôt want anyone else to hear. ‚ÄúUsed to be a respectable place, that hotel. But something changed. Some say a guest went missing, others say it was the owners, the husband and wife who ran it. One day, folks just stopped seeing them around. Only thing anyone knows for sure is that people who stay there‚Ä¶ sometimes they come back, sometimes they don‚Äôt.‚Äù


I wanted to protest, to insist that what I‚Äôd seen was real, but he was already closing up, giving me a look that said he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it any further. I thanked him and got into my car, hands trembling as I gripped the steering wheel.


As I drove out of town, I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following me. But there was nothing, just the empty highway stretching behind me. Just miles of desolate road.


Days went by, and I tried to put the whole thing behind me, to convince myself it was just a nightmare. I tried to have a good time with my parents. But that night changed me. My dreams were plagued with whispers, scratching sounds, glimpses of pale, twisted figures hiding in the shadows. I‚Äôd wake up in a sweat, heart racing, feeling that same suffocating pressure, as if something unseen was watching me. 


I decided to leave my parent‚Äôs place a week early. They kind of already knew something was bothering me, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell them. Maybe they knew about the hotel, but if they did, they would probably be like that mechanic. Probably would tell me to stay away or that what I experienced wasn‚Äôt real. 


And then, one night, as I was getting ready for bed after long drive back home. I received a letter. It was placed right on my doorstep. I slowly picked it up. 


It arrived with no return address. The envelope was old and yellowed, as if it had been forgotten for years. I almost didn‚Äôt open it, but something compelled me to. My hands shook as I slid the paper out, unfolding it to reveal two words, scrawled in faded ink:

Room 13


I dropped the letter as my eyes widened and immediately ran to check every lock in my apartment. I even called the cops to have the do a full thorough search. Nothing came of it. I swear it felt like I was losing my mind. I tried to sleep, but every time I closed my eyes, I felt that same chilling presence, that pressure building, like something waiting for me to close my eyes long enough.


In the days that followed, things got worse. Objects in my apartment would move on their own‚Äîa glass would slide across the table, the lights would flicker, and every so often, I‚Äôd catch a faint smell of mildew, that same metallic odor from the hotel room.


I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something had followed me, that it was waiting for me to return to Room 13. 


Finally, I decided I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôd go back, just to prove to myself that it wasn‚Äôt real, that I‚Äôd imagined it all. Part of me wishes that I had. 


I drove out to that same stretch of highway, my heart hammering as I neared the spot where the hotel should have been. But when I got there, I slammed on the brakes. I grew cold. The color drained from my face. No! No! 


The hotel was gone.


There was no building, no flickering neon sign, not even a foundation to mark where it had been. It was just an empty lot, overgrown with weeds. As if nothing had ever been there at all.


My mind spun, grasping for answers, for anything to explain what I‚Äôd been through. But as I sat there in stunned silence, I saw something in my rearview mirror.


A figure, standing at the edge of the lot.


It was the old woman from the front desk, her hollow eyes staring straight into mine, her face twisted in that sad, empty smile. I want to scream. 


I tried to turn to look directly at her, but by the time I twisted around‚Ä¶she was gone.


I don‚Äôt drive at night anymore. I moved what seems like countless times now. I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt eat. People have tried to reach out and check up on me. I ignore them. I don‚Äôt want‚Ä¶whatever this is to affect them too. 


No matter where I go, no matter how far I try to run, I can still feel them. Watching. Waiting. And sometimes‚Ä¶in the dead of night‚Ä¶when everything is silent‚Ä¶I can still hear that faint, rasping whisper.


Room 13 will always need a guest.


Mom‚Ä¶dad. If you‚Äôre reading this. I just want you to know I love you. I love you so much. 


And to whoever else is reading this.

I went down this morning and the drive through line was ridiculously long so I decided to go in the store.  It was even crazier in the store.  It took me maybe 10 to 15 minutes to order and almost 5 minutes for my coffee.

So I finally get up to order.  I get just a coffee and nothing else.  It comes to $2.30.  I give the cashier a $20 and tell her to just give me back $15 and to keep the change as a tip.

I hand her my $20 and she opens the register and takes out a 10 and a 5 and gives me back $35.  I don't say anything and give her a moment to correct her mistake but she doesn't and goes right to taking a new order from the crowd.

I get to my friend's house and tell him the great news about how I got an extra $20 at Tim Hortons.

He immediately called me an asshole and said she's going to get in trouble.  He even suggested I go back to the store and return it.  I told him it was the first day and no one is going to get in trouble.

AITA for getting one up on a big corporation?  Do I really need to police employees to make sure they don't make mistakes in my favor?",2,1731562251.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.63,False

I've been on Reddit threads infrequently in the constipation and PFD communities venting a bit. My question for this thread (with some background) is, has anyone here been able to reverse and replace laxative/supplement dependence with a safer method for chronic constipation/IBS/Pelvic floor? I will emphasize, my bowels didn't work right from early childhood**...

I always went really hard and infrequently as a young child, maybe 1-2x a week if I was lucky. I drank lots of fruit juice, was very active. Always clogged toilets and had nausea with my stomach issues... I think I was unfortunately a kid on antibiotics too much over formative years and that started a gut flora imbalance (apparently in a stool culture I had) bc apparently as an infant, I had no troubles. 

I keenly recall grinding sortof fist-like pains in my abdomen and back from my stomach troubles - this is still a key feature now (years later).

As a young kid, my mom would have me eat raisins or combine dried fruits for me and that would help induce a 'go', but these problems were chronic kind of following me through life and school.

I started dabbling in OTC laxatives here and there maybe 10-11 years ago in college as I shared a teeny bathroom with apartment roommates hating every second of NO privacy. It was still just dabbling and helped as needed.

Then around 20 yrs of age, I became more self-conscious of my battles with constipation because I met my now-husband and he'd have to unclog the toilet ü§¢ I was done with that noise. Somewhere around our first year of marriage, his mother whose a retired nurse introduced probiotics to me. 

I started taking a small 10bil cfu one in my 20s... and noticed this prob combined with breakfast and coffee helped regulate but... Still no going soft/well and my tricks started to fail me I. E. if I didn't keep the routine, I noticed I would rarely go, like olden days.

Somewhere along the line, a GI told me to start adding Mg as a supplement nightly. I was told ... I could safely take up to 800mg daily. So I switched to a new prob and started dabbling in Mg Citrate gummies (not the bottle) nightly, started small like around 300mg of course. This was a great success initially! Met a nutritionist who said cut out gluten and dairy, and this seemed to help too. I was upping water intake slowly throughout bc that's important. This all was great for maybe a year BUT... I seemed to become severely anemic weak and underweight. A functional doc I saw called it gut flora imbalance and malabsorption/Leaky gut.

Flash forward to 30 y.o. and I've continually changed up regimens. I now take Mg oxide chews nightly... 600 Mg :( a probiotic each morning, and sometimes add-in Miralax or a liver pill to the mix. It's still in somewhat safe territory maybe? but the high amount of Mg for years worries me and barely does much these days. I've been in Pelvic floor PT for hypertonic pf for the last 3 years as well. I drink like 80+ oz of water daily, eat fibrous veggies both cooked and raw, have a nice yogurt and granola each morning with caffeine. 
Sip chicken broth often...
Exercise I could try more of... 

I just go incomplete wormy poos that're unsatisfying and still leave the same old knotty pains of childhood. All my life now, never really knew what normal ppl feel like.

Has anyone done anything I haven't thought of here that's helped you to get back your life, sustain a relationship?

This is all subjective but...
-Anybody find a certain IBS-C med they like long? 
-Antidepressant maybe that's constipation-safe for them? 
-Tried a parasite cleanse that helped? 
-A colonic?
-Successfully weened off a laxative for a better regimen long-term? I've even thought of going to a rehab for this, but I think I'd mostly be in wrong company and don't trust to have a doc while there who really knows meds and nutrition for chronic constipation (not treating an eating disorder)",1,1731561949.0,ConstipationAdvice,2,1.0,False
1gqxqdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1gqxqdn/32_m4f_tx_looking_for_her/,32 [M4F] TX - Looking for Her,"Hello, I‚Äôm a 32 year old Hispanic male living in TX. I currently work as an engineer for a major refinery in the area, so my time outside of work can be fairly limited and I find it hard to make new connections outside of just work colleagues who sometimes go out for drinks. 

To give some history, I recently moved back to Texas late last year. Before that, I was moving around the country for work for about 3 years. First in Oregon, a few months in Iowa, and then in Chicago before making my way back to Texas on a job offer I just couldn‚Äôt turn down. Throughout that time, I‚Äôve found it hard to make connections outside of my current (mostly online) friend group. At first I blamed it on moving around so much. But I had over a year in most places I stayed to go out, get to know the area, and maybe find some connections. So that can‚Äôt be it, right?

I find myself feeling lonely, more now than ever since I‚Äôve decided to stick it out with this company for the long term and make the most of my career that I can here. But even with that loneliness in mind, how do I go about making friends, let along finding a partner now? I don‚Äôt really go out to clubs or party anymore. I go to the gym and a few coffee shops when I have the time, but I doubt you want to be approached by a random man while you‚Äôre doing your workout or working and enjoying your drink. Maybe I‚Äôm too in my own head, I‚Äôm not sure.

So what am I looking for? I‚Äôm looking for a companion to spend time with. Someone I can have plans for dinner with, someone to just mindlessly do nothing in the same vicinity with, to send bad memes to while we sit feet apart. I‚Äôm not looking to have a codependent relationship, been there done that, but to find someone who is stable in their life and knows what a healthy relationship is like. Age isn‚Äôt too much of a factor, to a certain degree, though I would prefer someone who isn‚Äôt going to need me to guide them through early adulthood. 

I am stable enough in my income to be able to support a stay at home partner and be able to fund their hobbies and give us a comfortable life. So if you‚Äôd rather be a homemaker, that‚Äôs fine with me. If you want to work, that‚Äôs fine as well. I don‚Äôt aim to take anyone‚Äôs autonomy away, simply to find someone to share life‚Äôs joys with. I would just ask that if you choose to stay home, please help with some organization and potential cooking when I‚Äôm running a bit too late at the office. 

I want to clarify that children aren't for me. Please don't try to change that, you won't. And it'll just be a really awkward conversation if you try to. 

Do I have physical preferences? Of course I do, I think we all do. My preferences are more with how someone presents themselves and takes care of their appearance more so than specific physical characteristics. My job has certain social functions that I sometimes have to attend and showing up well dressed and well put together can be a big factor in terms of image and perception. And you know what they say? ‚ÄúPerception is reality‚Äù, at least in the corporate world. I want to clarify, I‚Äôm not trying to find a model to date, I just want someone who can clean up nicely when necessary. I know it‚Äôs a vain ask, but sometimes you have to play the corporate game in order to be able to get to where you want to make a difference. 

I want to go ahead and give a disclaimer so that you don‚Äôt waste your time. I am in the larger side at the moment and am working on losing the weight for both aesthetic and health reasons. To give you an idea, I currently weight 260 and my end goal weight is 175. I am working with my doctor, a nutritionist, and a trainer to reach this and have already made progress. But if this isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôd want to be around for, or I‚Äôm just not your type that‚Äôs fine. Please don‚Äôt waste both of our time by making fun of my weight or mocking my efforts to become a better me. I know how easy that can be done through a screen and a keyboard. 

If you actually read all of this rambling mess and any of it resonated with you, shoot me a message and we can chat. No expectations, just a friendly exchanging of words. ",1,1731561860.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1gqxp7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1gqxp7s/this_sub_helped_me_convince_my_husband_to/,This sub helped me convince my husband to consider taking this med.,"The information I‚Äôm sharing is lived experience, just saying thanks you all for sharing your experiences here. 

I (45F) am not person who experiences ADHD. I have my own struggles in medicated for. My husband (53M) of 23 years of marriage is ADHD. He has both types, inattentive and hyperactive. Over the years the inattentiveness has become more pronounced. Outwardly and flaring hard. This  caused a myriad of issues between us and trust me when I say we don‚Äôt fight. 

Specifically these past two years finances got hard and he got depressed. He started Wellbutrin and after three months decided he didn‚Äôt need it. He grew into a head space that was more like my annoying brother and not my protective mature husband. This was due to frustration and being on the money struggle bus for so long.

That may sound weird, but we met when he was 30 and I 23 and for decades he‚Äôs been a not this, persona??? as a husband lol. He never bickered, or argued. We just meshed for 20 years, then we sharply didn‚Äôt with no obvious reason.

About a year ago I had a hysterectomy and started Wellbutrin. My life changed dramatically inside my head after day 6 on that med and I‚Äôve never looked back.
It did nothing for him, his depression was superficial at best. I was clinically depressed he wasn‚Äôt. He was annoyed at himself though and it took awhile to put out fingers on what was happening. We didn‚Äôt expect his inattentive ADHD to suddenly ‚Äúpop off‚Äù at 53. He‚Äôs is really great shape and lifts and is pretty healthy. But it happened and that‚Äôs when I became determined to find him a solution.

He falls asleep after coffee, he forgets where he puts anything, he get OCD on weird things and can‚Äôt let them go and this is where he and I became off. 

Suddenly everything I was doing he had to analyze to DEATH.  this man yells ‚ÄúGoogle it if you don‚Äôt believe me‚Äù as a defense mechanism and I couldn‚Äôt take any more of my brother-husband. No. 

Reading your lived experiences helped me identify a solution. Reading his symptoms accounted for in your posts helped me educate him on what may be happening and slow roll him into trying this med. Well.

He took 10 for 4 weeks and seemed annoyed at times even more lol, that happened to me as well on Wellbutrin so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. A few days ago he increased to 20. 


Hello!!! Omg, wow. ü§© he was in such an awesome mood tonight, I had to write a book here about it. He falls asleep instantly. We are finally on track here guys, thank you for saving my marriage. I don‚Äôt believe I could be married to my brother for the next 25!!

1gqxouj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tourettes/comments/1gqxouj/pissed_off_about_my17f_classmates/,Pissed off about my(17f) classmates ,"To start this off, today was a bad tic day in general. Not only because I had a tic attack, but also because I had coffee, which can be a trigger. 
 I went to the nurse's office today at lunch to take some medicine to calm my tics before they got too bad and I thought all was well. Went to 4th period and just went about my business and did my work. 

At the end of 4th hour, I noticed that I was starting to have eye tics. The bell Rang and I started walking to 5th hour with a friend.  We were talking while walking and made it to our next class (our 5th hour teachers are right across the hall from each other) and we went our separate ways. 

Once I walked into my class I noticed there was a sub and as I am an teacher's aide, I went to walk around the classroom to see if anything needed to be tidied. I walk past this guy (never liked him for as long as I can remember) and he was 'yawning' and making stupid noises, as children do (keep in mind we are almost adults in 12th grade) and a few of the other immature boys were doing the same thing. 

As they did this, I noticed my 'tic feeling' was getting stronger and the loud noises were starting to trigger me. I turned around and faced the instigator and loudly asked, ""Please stopp that, dude, you're triggering my tics"" and I gave him a 'wtf' look. 

I turned and went to where the teacher's staplers were and started checking them to see if they needed to be refilled. Then the kid's friends started doing the yawning thing and I felt like a wall was exploding inside me as my tic felling was starting to physically ache. 

I told the sub I NEEDED to go right then. And in my 504 plan I need to have another student to walk with me of I need to go to the nurse so I got a friend of mine and stepped out of the classroom. I took 5 or so steps out of the classroom and collapsed and started having whole body tics. 

I honestly don't remember having vocal tics due to another medical condition I have that causes me to  have brief memory loss, but I just know a guy from my class seeing me and getting a teacher. He sat by me and the teacher held my head as my friend that I was walking with ran to get the nurse.

I'm not mad about having the tic attack, I'm pissed about how it started. Those boys that triggered me goof off in that class and are so rude to the teachers and anyone else that they deem boring or easily pushed around. I hate that they think it's funny to  trigger people. The same kid that started it triggered a girl with auditory epilepsy using those rape whistles and she had to go online because of it. 

How do I deal with these assholes?? The school is taking care of things but I don't know if they will get the punishment they deserve. Any advice or support is appreciated.  Thanks for reading",1,1731561700.0,Tourettes,1,0.67,False

I 37F had recently returned to work (December 23) after having my youngest child and decided to resign after my maternity leave due to pnd. 
I came back to a different shop and area so I could rejoin one of my old colleagues who had transferred, I came back as a supervisor and I felt like I was ready to be back to work and looked forward to doing something for me. I had built strong connections with the girls in my team, and we always enjoyed our time at work. As expected, there can be some disagreements at work/rule break, and sometime this can be taken lightly or seriously. One my of girls had counselling with our line manager for breaking policy, and after her meeting she asked to take a break. I said this was fine and let her take a moment as I was not present at her meeting so I couldn‚Äôt say if she was upset or not. Once my line manger filled me in on the meeting and then left as her shift had ended, my girl come out to me extremely upset, she felt unsafe and wanted to leave. I of course wanted to make sure her well-being and mental state was protected and agreed for her to leave but if she could stay a short while so I could find cover, she stayed but ultimately decided that she could not return to work, and ‚Äòquit‚Äô her job. My heart broke for her, to see how upset she was, and instinctively I wanted to make sure she knew that I supported her but also our company has resources that she could use for support and I would get her all of the right details to contact before she decides to actually quit (I was made aware of some personal things she disclosed to me and felt that work was the best source of escape for her, so quitting on the spot was definitely not a good option).
Once she left I finished my shift and by the end of it, I still had not found any cover for her shift the next day. I had the contact number of another shop manager Laura, who‚Äôs wife works in my shop, and she has area cover responsibilities so I assumed she be a good person to ask for help and find cover for my girls shift the next day. Laura decided that instead of prioritising cover, she wanted the gossip instead. I didn‚Äôt want to gossip and wanted to only know if she had anyone to help, she said she will cover it, thinking she had a team member in mind, it wasn‚Äôt til the next morning I realised that the cover she found was herself‚Ä¶. And boy do I wish she had just got a team member instead of being her whole body to the shop because what I walked into had lead me to being on sick leave since July! ( just looked back at my messages from Laura and the chat has been erased! So I have nothing to post with this post).
It was Friday the 3rd of may, and I was on a closing shift. I decided to get there early so I cool have something to eat because I knew it was going to be busy. I said hello to everyone as usual and went to turn the corner into the office, and lo and behold, Laura was there. Taking up the entire office space with her negative aura. And instead of saying hello to me, I was met with a SO WHAT HAPPENED! I naturally was taken aback by this and I said, what do you mean? You know what happened, I told you. L- BUT WHAT DID YOUR MANAGER DO TO MAKE HER SO UPSET! Me- I don‚Äôt know I wasn‚Äôt in the meeting. All I know is she was upset and didn‚Äôt feel safe and wants to quit but I‚Äôm slowly convincing her not to and I got here early so I could eat and also her the numbers for unum and the people L- WHY ARE YOU GOING OVER YOUR MANAGER GETTING THE PEOPLE TEAM INVOLVED! Me- that‚Äôs not what‚Ä¶L- YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER BEFORE YOU GO OVER HER HEAD! Me- I did, I spoke to her this morning and she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ L- YOUR TELLING ME YOU TOLD HER! 
Me- if you let me speak then I can explain L- continues her belligerent rant‚Ä¶ me- starting to go into fof, whole body shaking with the no control tears streaming down my face, thinking to myself‚Ä¶ what is this person doing? Why is she so angry at me for wanting to help a member of staff‚Ä¶ next thing I know I kissed my teeth. L- did you just kiss you teeth at me? Me-yes I did L- I consider that swearing, so I‚Äôll ask you not to do that again‚Ä¶ me- internal scream RACIST! me- your not letting me speak, I walked in here with my sandwich and coffee and your screaming at me for what? I know the company policies, my boyfriend works for the company! We live together! You think I wouldn‚Äôt have checked in with him or even my manager who‚Äôs been my friend for 10 years about this situation! 
Now I‚Äôm screaming Laura has decided to change her tone.
L- oh it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt want you to be so involved with your teams personal issues‚Ä¶ I did the same for someone once and they had a bad outcome‚Ä¶she said this with a pretend sad face expression. Me- I‚Äôm 37 years old and I‚Äôm not stupid, I‚Äôve been through life and experiences to know where to stand when it comes to personal problems and work! I‚Äôve had support from the people team before and they really helped me. L- what do you mean the people team? You mean occupational health? Me- well yes! If you had let me speak then you would have known that I as my intention, but no you wanted to go on at me like I‚Äôm some stupid person‚Ä¶. Feeling like I‚Äôm going to blow my switch my instinct to leave kicked in, I had to leave because now I don‚Äôt feel safe‚Ä¶ my fof suddenly intensified and my intrusive thoughts roll in‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm having an internal argument with myself‚Ä¶ stop it, don‚Äôt say that ‚Ä¶ having the urge to punch myself in the head‚Ä¶ me trying to break from the thoughts I say to my supervisor I need to leave because my mind is telling me some pretty messed up things and I have to go, I can‚Äôt come back to this place. I managed to walk out the back and go to my car, rage crying and shaking. Who the fuck is this person to be like this with me when all I‚Äôm trying to do is make sure my girl has the resources she needs. 
What happens next is literally nothing‚Ä¶ nothing is done. No welfare checks on me, nothing. I totally disassociated, which I‚Äôm stuck in now. 
There was another incident recently with Laura which lead me to write this post. She‚Äôs now telling people I said something really messed up, which is a blatant lie! AITA for holding this all in and only just deciding to speak about it now? ",1,1731561684.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Obviously the number one recommendation seems to be Digiboils, but... They're hard to get in the Philippines. I could order a 220v version from Australia, but it would end up costing as much (or more!) in shipping/taxes/duties as the actual purchase cost. 

I do, however, have very easy access to Chinese-market stuff via Alibaba/Lazada. So I'm wondering if there's anything really ""special"" about the Digiboil that I should be looking out for? Is it just a tank with a heating element at the bottom? Obvious a coffee pot/percolator isn't an option because that has circulation equipment built in. But there are a lot of temperature-controlled ""Water Boilers"" available that I'm thinking might be an option. [Something like this](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/stainless-steel-electric-hot-water-bucket-restaurant-commercial-machine-large-capacity-automatic-insulation-i4621897910-s26524376311.html), maybe?

Obviously nothing like that is going to be as ***good*** as a Digiboil. I'm well aware of that fact. But I'm not at a point (yet) where spending $750-1000 to import a $250 machine is a viable option. So ""good enough"" is where my head is at currently.

1gqxiyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gqxiyw/the_rabbit_box/,The Rabbit Box,"When I was six years old, my mother sent me to stay with my grandparents for the summer. 

At this time in my life, I had never met my mother's parents, and I had never been away from home longer than a weekend. When my mom broke the news to me that I would be going away for nearly two months, I sobbed on and off for several days. It wasn't until she told me that my grandparents had a dog that I began to feel some excitement about leaving home. 

Kindergarten was ending, and on the last day, I joined the class on the rainbow-colored carpet where we were prompted by our teacher, Ms. Hayne, to share something we had planned for summer break. Ms. Hayne was a young teacher, in her second or third year at the school whose voice was sweet and soft. When it was my turn to share, I proudly exclaimed that I would be spending the summer at my grandparents‚Äôs house. I made sure to mention the dog. My peers giggled and shouted at the mention of the animal, and that helped me to adjust to the idea of leaving even more. 

It felt like some sort of adventure. Still, the day came, and I trembled with nerves in the back seat of my mom‚Äôs Honda as she drove me several hours away from home and toward the unknown. The road seemed to be unending, and the wide city street eventually narrowed into a poorly maintained stretch of asphalt that dug deep into a wooded mountain. 

‚ÄúWhere are the other cars?‚Äù I asked my mother as I peered around checking each window. ‚ÄúNot many people come up this way. Grandma and Grandpa like their privacy, so they moved up here back before you were born.‚Äù Sensing my uneasiness she added, ‚ÄúDont worry honey. You are going to have so much space to run around and explore. It's going to be a good change of pace for you.‚Äù I shuffled in my seat and fell quiet. I did like the idea of exploring outside. My mom and I lived on the second floor of an old apartment building. There were some neighbor kids with whom I spent most of my free time, but finding something to do other than coloring or building Legos was difficult since none of us were allowed to play outside. Too many strangers and moving cars. 

It wasn't the worst neighborhood, but it wasn't the kind of place where you let your kids roam free. There was always an adult watching us when we would venture out to play on the basketball court, where we would usually just end up playing freeze tag. That ten-by-twenty cement pad contained the majority of my outdoor experience. It would be nice to have some freedom to run wild, catch bugs, and climb trees. 

The road trailed on and the foliage seemed to grow all-encompassing, almost swallowing the small road in some areas. As branches stretched over the skies the shadows paved the street in shapes all too frightening for a child with an active imagination. I chose to keep my view centered on the seat in front of me. We drove all day, and when the sun had set we finally pulled onto a dirt road. We continued for at least another mile before a large house came into view behind the trees. 

As we slowly inched the car closer the fauna opened up into a clearing, and the whole property was visible. Near the main house was a barn that looked as though it used to be painted red, but was now chipped away revealing mostly brown and white wood. As we rounded the house to the back where my mom parked the car a small shed appeared. 

‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôre here!‚Äù my mom shouted with more relief than enthusiasm. I kept my seat belt on, hoping that if I waited long enough my mother would decide this whole thing had been a mistake and turn the car around. Instead, she removed her keys, killing the radio that was softly humming static, and opened her door. I followed my mom's lead, not wanting to remain alone in the car. Stepping out of the vehicle I was hit with a light gust of wind that chilled my small bones and made me grimace. I looked at my mom, and she could see how tense I was. 

Grabbing my hand she led me around to the side door and knocked. I clutched her hand in mine as we waited for the door to swing open. After a moment, creaking footsteps approached, and the hinges of the door squeaked to reveal a tender aged face. My grandmother stood in the doorway with a soft smile and warm eyes ushering us in with her free hand, the other clutching a plate of cookies. ‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù she squealed. 

I looked at my mother who wore the same soft smile on her own face. We walked in and the door was shut behind us. The warmth my grandmother exuded did a decent job of melting my fears, but the atmosphere of the home was quick to send the chills back down my spine. All of the lights were off. Only the moonlight shining in through the entryway window illuminated my surroundings. ‚ÄúOh excuse me one moment.‚Äù my grandmother said as she placed the tray of cookies on the coffee table and rushed to turn on a lamp. 

When the small, solitary light source was flipped on the house was left looking eerie. My mom began catching up with my grandma. The two had talked over the phone several times over the years, but this was the first time they had been in the same room since I was born. They sat on the couch as my mom complained about the drive and my grandmother tried to force-feed her oatmeal raisin cookies. Noticing my shyness my mom excused me to explore the house. ‚ÄúYour room is upstairs to the right,‚Äù Grandma said. I picked up my bag, slung it over my shoulders, and headed towards the staircase. As I ascended I made sure to count each stair, a habit that I have yet to break even in my adulthood. I reached the top. 

14 steps. 

I glanced to my right, seeing that the hallway led to a small bedroom and a bathroom adjacent to it. I peered to the left out of curiosity and let out an involuntary scream. Down the left hallway was my grandfather, a man wholly unfamiliar to me, standing in the doorway. His silhouette was outlined by the shining light behind him, creating a specter in my young imagination. 

My mother rushed up the stairs when she heard me and frantically asked what was wrong. Frozen in fear, I stammered for the words. ‚ÄúTh..the‚Ä¶man‚Ä¶‚Äù I pointed down the hall. Grandpa had turned his back and began walking into the master bedroom, shutting the door behind him without a word. ‚ÄúOh don't you mind him,‚Äù Grandma said as she reached the 14th step. ‚ÄúHe's been feeling under the weather. He hopes to make an appearance tomorrow after he's gotten some rest.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I plan on leaving kind of early tomorrow. I have to get back for some meetings at work.‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù Grandma replied, ‚ÄúNo one gets up earlier than Grandpa.‚Äù

The next morning I got up early to say goodbye to my mom. Up until this point I had been the only one with visible hesitation, but she seemed to linger longer than expected, looking into my eyes and showering me with kisses and I-love-yous. I wish I could have stayed in that moment forever. True to my grandmother‚Äôs words, my grandfather had gotten up before anyone but chose to spend the morning hunting. This was irritating to my mother, but she really did have responsibilities at work to return to, so she eventually got into the driver‚Äôs seat of her car and rounded the house heading for the main road. 

I waved goodbye and watched her car until it dipped past the clearing and was absorbed by the tree line. With the vehicle out of sight, my fate was sealed. I would be spending almost two full months in this foreign place. ‚ÄúCome on inside. We can have some breakfast together.‚Äù said my grandmother. 

The rest of the morning was fairly normal. I ate eggs and bacon, colored a picture, and even got to spend some time watching cartoons on the old TV in the living room. It was the kind that had the antennas at the top, and I didn't get any of the normal channels but I eventually found an animated show and sat back to enjoy the story. That morning I had also gotten to know grandma‚Äôs dog Buffalo, who had gotten used to my presence and was lying next to me on the couch. 

Everything changed when my grandfather returned home from hunting. Though I was in the living room, I immediately tuned in to his arrival as he threw the front door open and yelled out to my grandma. I stayed seated on the couch, but I could hear her greeting him at the door. Her demeanor was drastically different from then on. Instead of the bubbly, cheerful woman I had met the night before, she became a fearful shell when he was around. 

Grandpa mumbled something about having lunch ready by the time he returned from the basement. Dragging two lifeless rabbits at his side, my grandfather walked to the basement door and stopped. He turned to me and said, ‚ÄúDont you go snooping around my basement, you hear me, kid?‚Äù I nodded, and he descended the stairs closing the door behind him. ‚ÄúWhat's in the basement?‚Äù I asked turning to Grandma. ‚ÄúThat's where your grandpa does his work. He sells the rabbit meat and skins, and he uses the downstairs area to clean and prepare them.‚Äù 

I didn't like the idea of dead rabbits in the house. In my innocent mind, I could only feel sadness for the creatures, and even a little fear. I had never seen a dead thing before. A curiosity about the rabbits started to grow within me. Not the blood and guts part. I wasn't old enough to understand that. But the idea of something being alive and then just‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶not being alive anymore was sort of fascinating in a morbid way. I knew then that I had to get a closer look at the rabbits. I wish that I hadn't. Maybe if I had followed the rules and stayed out of that basement, none of this would have happened to me.

A few days passed, and the routine became clear. Every morning, Grandpa would go rabbit hunting. And every day a little after breakfast he would return home with 2 to 5 rabbits strung up by their legs. I remember that, even as a child, it was odd to me that I never saw any meat or skins returning with Grandfather when he would come back upstairs. Wasn't he selling them? They surely can't just still be sitting in the basement‚Ä¶could they? It was hard to come to any conclusions, especially because Grandpa hardly ever talked to me or even acknowledged my existence. 

Grandmother was silent. I quickly became aware that the happy talkative personality I had seen when we first arrived had been a facade, hiding the real grandma. In reality, she was timid, quiet, and kept to herself most days. She only really spoke to me about when a meal was prepared, or when it was time to go to sleep. Other than those times, she stayed in her room. I was too young to realize that I was being neglected, but I understood that something about this situation was wrong. 

Left to fend for myself most of the day, I spent my time exploring the woods with Buffalo. He was a good dog and stayed close to me even without a leash. Though he was a coward most of the time, he seemed to be very protective of me and would often jump in front of me to warn me of ledges, streams, or animal dens. I grew to love that dog. One day while I was at the edge of the tree line about to go exploring I noticed my grandfather getting into his truck and driving off the property. I was about to continue on my expedition when a thought crossed my mind. 

This is the perfect time to see the rabbits in the basement. 

With my grandpa out of the house, I figured I could sneak downstairs, take a quick peek, and be back upstairs before anyone noticed. Grandmother would be in her room until dinner time, and even without knowing where Grandfather went, I estimated I had at least a few minutes. Maybe more. I turned back and headed inside. Once inside I did a brief check to make sure my grandmother wasn't wandering about. Just as I thought she would be, she was shut up in her bedroom. 

It was almost too perfect. I stepped over to the basement door, making sure to tiptoe in case my footsteps alerted her. When I reached the door I was surprised to find it unlocked. They were making this too easy. I opened the door slowly, attempting to minimize the creaking that all the house doors emitted. Looking down the steps, I took in the darkness. ‚ÄúStay here boy,‚Äù I said to Buffalo. If there was raw rabbit meat down there, I didn't want him getting into it and blowing my cover. 

I began my slow descent, counting the stairs. Reaching the bottom, I muttered, 

‚Äú12‚Äù, 

under my breath. I looked around for a light switch and had to feel the walls with my hands until I found what I was looking for and flicked it up. The small bulb illuminated the room in a dim yellow shade. I was starting to feel a little creeped out, and for a second thought to turn back, until I noticed a door on the other side of the room. I figured that must be where Grandpa kept the rabbit remains. 

Inching forward I reached out for the handle, but before I could turn the knob I was caught off guard by a loud booming voice. ‚ÄúSo!‚Äù my Grandfather shouted from behind me. ‚ÄúYou want to see what I keep in the old storage closet do ya kid?‚Äù I quickly turned to face him, my blood running cold. He had a smile on his face, but he didn't seem to be happy at all. There was malice in his eyes. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry Grandpa I'll go back upstairs,‚Äù I said timidly. He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. You want to see what's inside. And I want to show you.‚Äù Fear froze me in my tracks. I couldn't say anything as he walked closer and reached out for the handle to the door. When he opened it a feeling of uneasy confusion washed over me. It was a closet, about 3 feet in width and 4 feet in length. The only thing inside was a wooden chest. It was dark brown and had a large round lock on it. 

The chest was big, taking up most of the space in the closet. I didn't understand what he was trying to show me. Grandpa fished into his pocket and pulled out a key. ‚ÄúLet's take a look inside, shall we?‚Äù He said. I was still frozen in place. I no longer wanted to see what was inside, but I hoped he would open it quickly so we could get the ordeal over with and move on to my inevitable punishment. Kneeling down, he unlocked the chest and motioned for me to open it. Hesitantly, I grabbed the edges of the lid and lifted the top. 

Before I had a chance to recognize the contents of the box I was grabbed from behind. Kicking and screaming I begged to be let go, but I was too small and weak to fight against him. He shoved me forcefully into the chest and slammed the lid shut. I continued to scream, and from outside the box, I could hear the old man howling with laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe this will teach you not to go snooping in other people's business!‚Äù he bellowed. I pushed up on the top of the box but it didn't budge. The monster had locked it. 

Through my tears, I listened as his footsteps walked away. I heard him climb the stairs and shut the basement door as he exited. After a few more moments of crying, I assessed the contents of the chest. It was too dark to see clearly. The chest had small, almost unnoticeable gaps along the seams in the edges, and being in a closet there wasn't much light available to seep through. 

When put into dark spaces the pupils dilate in order to capture as many photons as possible. It takes time, but as long as there is a small trace of light, the eyes will adjust to it to the best of their abilities. When my young eyes eventually captured the small hint of visibility I was afforded within the box, I began to scream again. With me in the old wooden chest were the remains of a half dozen or so rabbits. Soft fur mixed with sticky congealed blood hugged me from every angle.¬†

I am not sure how long I was left in the box. It must have been hours because eventually when my grandfather returned to let me out the sky was dark and it was time for bed. Everything changed after that night. I was still afforded the liberty of roaming the house and forest during the day, but at night I was always led downstairs, where my grandfather would put me in the box, and I would spend the night there. 

In the mornings when he would go hunting, he would let me out and take me hunting with him. My job was the carry the rabbits after he had shot them. After breakfast, he would show me how to remove the bones. These were his real trophies. With twine and sticks, he would bind them together to form symbols. Sigils of sorts I guess. He was always vague about what they were meant for, but he believed they held the power to ward off evil. The kind of evil was never specified. 

After crafting the symbols we would walk around the forest and hang them on trees. The bloodied coats were placed into the chest. He claimed they held special importance as well, but never told me what he did with them. When the chest was filled with nine skins he would take them out to his truck and drive away with them. Maybe he was selling them, but the way he talked about them made it seem as though they held sacred powers as well. I guess I'll never know for sure what he did with them. Eventually, the summer ended, and I went back to live with my mother once more. I never saw either of my grandparents again.¬†

That brings me to why I am writing this. Many years have passed since that summer at the farm. I buried my trauma, and despite all odds, I've actually grown up to be pretty successful. I'm a social worker who specializes in neglected children‚Äôs cases. I live a humble, quiet life, and it suits me. 

But the other day, out of the blue, I received a call from an executor of my grandfather‚Äôs will. I guess the old man finally kicked the bucket. Apparently, he had left me something, too. I was hesitant to accept a meeting with the representative at first. I didn't really need or want the man‚Äôs money, or whatever he left me. But I decided to go anyway, at least to placate my curiosity. 

We met in a law building filled to the brim with men and women in suits looking far too busy. My job has its own fair share of hustle, paperwork, and long days, so I could sympathize with the people milling about me. The conference room was on the second floor. I scaled to the top and paused.

12 stairs.

When we entered the conference room I was asked to sit down, look over a few papers, and sign them. Skimming the documents I grew confused and asked for clarification about the itemized inheritance. Under my name, there was a number one. ‚ÄúExcuse me, what does this one next to my name mean?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThat's the amount of items left for you specifically by your grandfather in the will.‚Äù the representative explained. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶what is it? What did he leave me?‚Äù¬†

He turned to the closet in the conference room and fished out a key from his pocket. When he opened the door, lying on the floor was a large, dark brown, wooden chest.

I ran away from my  house a couple months and was brough back to my parent's house again. My family is very controlling and toxic and it's generally never been easy. I'm studying at uni rn and my grades aren't great I've gone from a straight A student to B+ and Bs even though I spend majority of my time studying. I'm a math major so none of it is easy and I've recently been feeling like I don't want to do this anymore. Once upon a time I had huge career prospects, doing this and that. But it doesn't seem matter anymore. I don't care if I'm smart or stupid, whether or not I 'make' it in life. I've been through a lot and I think it broke my ability to think clearly in every aspect, almost as I am constantly disassociated. 

But I've made peace with it, it's difficult to go home everyday but I've decided to save up and move to another country once I graduate college. I'll work part-time in a small coffee or bakery, because baking brings me peace. I'll read books all day ( and ik working part time will not be enough to support my self so I will freelance work in web development or whatever it is I want). I'd read books and write and write till life fills me to the brim. I won't ever have kids, I don't think I'm mentally stable to be a mother and I also don't like taking care of them.

1gqxgsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1gqxgsx/does_my_dad_have_autism/,Does my dad have Autism? ,"My dad was a very strange guy.   Since he's never been dangerous, I've just kind of let it be. But recently my wife has become convinced that he's autistic. I just thought he had severe social anxiety.  His brother (my uncle) was the nicest, coolest, friendliest guy, but my dad was so strange.

Here are a few notes about him. Does this sound like a guy with autism?

\- While his younger brother was hanging out with friends, having girlfriends. His only relationships were with his mom and dad, and his dogs. Still to this day he relates better to dogs than he does with people;

\- One time he told me this story of when he was in University, and he was walking with another guy to class and my dad was stressing out over how close he was to this guy ""was I too close? Or too far? Does he think I'm acting weird?"";

\- Never had any close friends. He blames this on growing up atheist in a religious community, but he has no university friends, none from his early working days... Nothing. Sometimes he asks this really weird guy in our neighborhood to go out for coffee, but he always regrets it;

\- My mom once told me that any time they went to parties they were invited to. My dad would stress my mom out making sure they got to the venue at the EXACT time it started. Usually this ended up with the two of them being the only ones there for an hour or two. She said it was always so embarrassing;

\- Always HATED talking about himself. He told me it helped him having kids, so he could deflect attention onto us. Said he was relieved when he retired so he could just say ""I'm retired"" rather than be embarrassed about his job... Even though he always had a good job in a strong industry;

\- I don't think he's ever missed a day of shaving. Never any stubble at all. Shaves every single day. Whereas me, some days I shave, other days I don't. Sometimes I leave it until it get's a little uncomfortable, etc. But he shaves every single day;

\- The same thing goes for his fingernails. You know how when your fingers start to grow long they're white at the ends. He told he he hates having that, so he always always always clips his nails short;

\- Pretty much refuses to do anything anyone else likes to do. He does what he wants, and tries to encourage my mom to do what he wants. Otherwise she does what she wants alone, or with one of my sisters.  I remember being a kid and asking him to take me bowling, he refused. He wanted to go for a walk, so we walked;

\- He has never read a fictional book, ever. He's read biographies, books on fishing, boating... but NEVER fiction;

\- Stressed out CONSTANTLY. Always worried about some kind of bad news that will destroy his investment portfolio and he won't be able to support himself and my mom. Usually his anxiety shows up late at night, where he just stresses to the extreme which prevents him from sleeping;

\- Growing up he was always mad.  At home he was always angry at us for one thing or another.  We don't do enough dishes, we don't clean our rooms enough, always giving us a bad time about something;

\- He told me at work he had so much social anxiety that he took a ""dale carnegie course"" to make him be more comfortable in social settings. He couldn't talk to his coworkers, was totally stressed out before walking into someone's office. He said this course helped. He took it when he was in his 40s;

\- I don't think he's ever had a good night sleep in his life.  Falls asleep early, wakes up after a few hours, can't get back to sleep;

\- When he met my mother, he told her he would stop by at a certain time. When that time came, he got so scared that he just drove right past the house. Pulled over and had to build himself up the courage to turn around and meet her;

\- He has only once said to me ""I love you"", and it he said it in a joking way.  He hugged me once after his dad died. Other than that, no real show of emotion;

\- When my oldest sister was born, he wouldn't touch her for the first couple of months until my mother forced him to;

\- Avoids difficult conversations like the plague. My mom got upset at me when I got engaged and refused to come to my wedding. I told I won't see either of them until they apologize to my wife. He refuses, it's been 4.5 years;

\- Recently he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Could he be autistic? Or is he just a weird guy with social anxiety?

EDIT:  HE ALSO ABSOLUTELY HATED ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY SPICY, EVEN AVOIDED ETHNIC FOOD WORRYING THAT IT ""MIGHT BE SPICY"", BUT REALLY JUST HATED ANY FOODS THAT WERE DIFFERENT OR HAD STRONGER FLAVOR. WE LIVE IN A VERY MULTICULTURAL CITY BUT YOU WILL NEVER FIND HIM EATING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE BLAND FOOD HE'S ACCOSTOMED TOO.

However there are others that have the following issue: They either spray the coffee violently while brewing a good-tasting coffee or I reduce the stove heating so the coffee pours slowly with crema, but then the coffee gets a nasty bitter taste, probably because of the coffee being brewed by the boiling water for too long.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3q934z/me_32_m_with_my_ex_33f_broke_up_over_a_wedding/)¬† **Oct 26, 2015** 

[Copy of the post](https://imgur.com/a/Fgs16Yg) 

I dated my ex for about 4 years. 

My family is from Nigeria and I'm very proud of my culture. My ex is white. I grew up in Australia but I have close ties to my roots. 

Originally race was not an issue when we first started dating but as we got more and more serious, I felt like she wasn't willing or didn't really understand how important my family and culture are to me. 

My SIL was always close with my mother despite the cultural barrier and always seemed happy to come to family events and spend time with us and treats my like her own brother. She's even been learning how to cook some of our foods from my mother which made my mum really happy and my brother has been learning to cook North Indian style curries and stuff as well. My SIL isn't conservative or anything but culture is important to her and my brother and as I get older, it feels important to me too. 

The final straw was at my brother's wedding that spurred me into action. My SIL is Indian and she's also very fiercely proud of her culture as well and they've always talked about how mixed race kids grow up culture neutral whereas they wanted their kids to have the best of both worlds. 

I've noticed that my ex was never that into my culture, never really spent time with my family and didn't really enjoy coming to family functions and that sort of thing and used to always question some of our cultural practices in a really quizzical kind of way and I could tell that she found it a bit dumb. She also made comments about immigrants not taking the effort to ""assimilate"". Her words. 

Anyway my brother and SIL had an amazing Indian/Nigerian fusion type of wedding. Because in her culture white is the colour of widows and black is the colour for funerals, they specifically, under dress code stated to wear your colours, no black or white. 

My ex mostly only wears black. It didn't really bother me but on the day of the wedding she wore a black dress. I asked her not to wear a black dress because it specifically stated on the invite not to but she was adamant that my SIL was being a bridezilla and she didn't have to accommodate. 

Anyway, at the wedding my ex was the ONLY one in black, my SIL took one look at her and asked her if she was going to a funeral after the wedding. My ex got very embarrassed and said that she didn't have any other dresses when my cousin piped up with ""Oh why didn't you tell us, you could have borrowed one of mine, we're the same size"". 

My SIL didn't say anything after that, they were too busy with other stuff but my ex was fuming the entire time at the wedding. To make matters worse, she says a few other people asked her why she was wearing black. I didn't see anyone but they might have. 

After the wedding, she was mad at me for not backing her up. I told her not to wear a black dress and that if she needed to buy one then she had plenty of time. 

She said she didn't need to buy one since she has a right to wear what she wanted and that it was unreasonable to dictate something like this for a dress code since she wasn't from their culture. 

Anyway the fight escalated and finally in the heat of the moment I broke up with her. 

It's been a few days now and she's blowing up my phone alternatively begging me for another chance and but also mad at me for not backing her up. 

I feel like, given how well my SIL interacts with my family even though she's from another culture, how respectful she is, I want someone like that. For me, a wedding is about families not just individuals and I don't want to lose my relationship with my family over my girlfriend/wife. 

I need some perspective here, did I do the right thing or should I have backed up my ex? 

TLDR: broke up with my ex over cultural differences, wondering if I did the right thing. 

I mean, it's a silly fight alright, the bride herself wasn't even mad about it, I'm sure they can figure something out. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r2ryg/update_me_32_m_with_my_ex_33f_broke_up_over_a/)¬† **Nov 1, 2015 (6 days later)** 

[Copy of the update](https://imgur.com/a/joJPkAu) 

I spoke to my brother and SIL about it because they'd noticed I seemed down and didn't talk about my ex at all. 

They convinced me to talk to her because they thought it was very disrespectful what she did but ""her kind of white"" didn't understand family or culture and I did invest 4 years of my life with her. 

My brother and SIL also told me that I owed it to myself to get some closure and I agreed. 

I spoke to her a few days ago because how abrupt the relationship ended. 

It did not go well. 

We met and had coffee in a park. I told her how hurt I was that she would disrespect my brother and SIL on their wedding day by wearing a dress in one of the two colours they asked us not to wear. 

She told me that she'd forgotten about wedding and had to rush to get something to wear. I told her I wasn't convinced, the wedding had been on everyone's mind and we'd been asked to help set up the hall which she didn't want to help with but I went. 

She told me this was a stupid fight over a stupid dress. I didn't feel that way, I felt it was her not respecting our culture. That's when she got annoyed at told me that culture is a man made thing and that we were in Australia now. 

I told her that my heritage was always going to be important to me and my future children and that I couldn't be with someone who didn't feel that way. She mentioned things like FGM and stuff (none of the women in my family have gone through that!) and stuff and I told her that culture is a dynamic thing and that my family didn't even believe in that stuff and weren't that backwards. I was offended she'd even think so. Surely you see from meeting them that they're not like that! It was wrong of me but I pointed out that all my mother, my female cousins etc were all more educated and successful than her. 

That was when the conversation started rapidly going downhill. She told me she'd chosen a less strenuous career for me because we wanted to have kids and she wanted to be there to raised them unlike my double income family members, including my mother because I'd mentioned that my mother had worked weekends sometimes. My mother got an education against all odds and my parents have always been after me to educate myself which I have. 

That pissed me off. I told her quite angrily that I always respected what my mother and father had done for us, that she was 28 when she met me so she didn't choose a less strenuous career for me, she couldn't blame me for that. 

She then got upset and said she didn't have much time to have kids, how could I do that to her, she should have listened to her family that I was untrustworthy and she'd wasted the best years of her life on me. 

I told her if that's the way she felt, then it's better that we stay broken up and got up and walked off. 

Yesterday I got a nasty FB messages from various family members calling everything from a [n word] to how my ex was lucky she didn't get AIDS from me. 

I've blocked all of them. I told my family about it and they were furious. I'm better off without her. It's a good thing we didn't live together even though we've got stuff at both our houses. Her family was a bit conservative like that. 

She's texted me a few times since apologizing and wanted to talk again but I only responded to say that I wanted to pick up my stuff and I'd boxed her stuff up so we should probably meet at the park to exchange it. An hour later at midnight the day before she kept texting and calling me to come pick give her stuff immediately so I went with my brother, SIL and cousin and we exchanged stuff. Her dad was there and he started getting riled up, calling me names, a piece of shit etc but my SIL got right up in his face and just started yelling right back up at him and told him that we'd got to police and show him the 15 odd messages of his daughter saying that if I didn't come get my stuff she'd destroy it and she was happy to post all the nasty messages his family had sent me to their workplaces. My ex then begged her dad to calm down and so he walked off. 

I refused to go inside the house and told my ex to get just my stuff. Turns out she hadn't packed up my stuff so my SIL suggested we drop her stuff off at a mutual friend's house and ex had a week so she could do the same. I called around to find a friend and she agreed to it at the time as well. 

My ex then messaged me today apologizing because she wasn't expecting my family members to turn up and that she'd wanted to talk and she reacted badly. (With her father there? Yeah right). 

I told her the same thing. She had a week get my stuff packed up and dropped off to friend's house. She texted me back saying it didn't have to be like this etc but I told her it did and I didn't want to discuss anything further. 

In the future I'll notice warning signs about her family's behavior and stuff well ahead and not always feel like I have to prove myself over and over again because I'm black or put up with Nigerian scam jokes or being ""affectionately"" called blackie because I don't want to make a fuss or because I didn't want to be seen as over sensitive. 

It wasn't till I spoke to my brother and to a lesser extent my SIL after this conversation that I realized how not normal this was. Anyway, I have dropped her stuff off and I'm just hoping I get my stuff back from her place. The most expensive thing is a tablet but I won't be too out of sorts if I don't get it back, it'll just be an expensive lesson. 

TLDR: Talk to ex, things went rapidly downhill. We are done for good.

But when she sees him again, she realizes that some things never quite fade away.","The warm summer breeze swept through the streets as Hermione stood in front of a caf√©, adjusting the strap of her bag. It had been months since she last saw Harry. She thought, after all this time, she had moved on, that she had buried any feelings for him. After all, they were just friends‚Äîalways had been, always would be, right?

But today was different.

Hermione had run into some acquantainces the day before, who mentioned that Harry was back in town. ""He‚Äôs not with *her* anymore,"" they had said. ""You should call him. It‚Äôd be good for both of you.""

With a deep breath, Hermione pushed open the door to the caf√©, hoping the familiar scent of coffee would calm her nerves.

And there he was.

Harry sat at a corner table, looking the same as ever‚Äîdark hair a bit longer than usual, green eyes shining with the same quiet intensity. His casual outfit‚Äîa simple t-shirt and jeans‚Äîwas effortless, yet he still looked undeniably handsome. The way he leaned forward, arms resting on the table, his smile lighting up the room... Hermione‚Äôs heart did a familiar little flip in her chest.

She stood frozen for a moment, watching him. He had always been charming, but it was different now. There was something more mature about him, something that made her heart ache with the realization that he had grown up. And so had she.

*I thought I could forget about him,* Hermione thought, her chest tightening as she took a hesitant step forward. *I thought I could let go, but maybe I never really did.*

He looked up, and the smile he gave her was warm and immediate, just like it always had been. ‚ÄúHermione!‚Äù He stood up quickly, and for a moment, she wondered if he was just as surprised to see her as she was to see him. ""I didn‚Äôt know you were back in town. It‚Äôs great to see you.""

Hermione felt her stomach flutter as she returned his smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you too. I‚Äîuh‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt expect you to be back for a while. I'm so sorry‚ÄîI heard the news. ""

Harry‚Äôs expression faltered for a brief moment, but then he shrugged, settling back into his relaxed demeanor. ‚ÄúYeah, things ended with *her* a while ago. Needed some time, you know? Just‚Ä¶ getting back to life.‚Äù He gestured to the seat across from him. ‚ÄúSit down. It‚Äôs been too long.‚Äù

Hermione smiled and sat down, placing her bag beside her. It was all so natural, like no time had passed, but underneath it all, she could feel something shifting in her. Her heart had started beating a little faster, her thoughts racing. It was more than just friendship. It always had been.

As they caught up on the usual topics‚Äîold friends, life post-Hogwarts‚ÄîHermione couldn‚Äôt help but feel an ache in her chest every time Harry‚Äôs eyes met hers. It was subtle, but undeniable. The connection between them, built over years of shared experiences and quiet moments, was still there.

But was it enough? Could she still make herself believe they were just friends?

So to preface, I know I'm something of a nepo baby, but it is what it is. 

My mom is incredibly successful in a very niche, but very lucrative field of business. This allowed my dad to be a SAHD & for me & my siblings to get a good education. 

When I graduated from college I decided to go into the same field as my mom. While I love her & our relationship is good, I very much did not want to only be viewed as her kid, or receive special treatment due to how well regarded she is, so I use my dad's surname, and generally keep who my mom is to myself. I also avoided coming to work for her. 

In my field & country it's generally accepted that people are hired for a trial period, at the end of which either the employee or employer can cut ties with no fines or compensation required. 

So anyway I went to work at one company (again I'll remind you - very niche market, very few employment opportunities). I went in for my trial period and everyone seemed pretty happy with me. I put out some fires & one superior describes me as ""a workhorse"" because I'm first to the office, last out the door. It goes pretty well. Except for one colleague in my team. 

This dude is a HUGE jerk. I'm a bit of a people pleaser and try to be on good terms with everyone, but Jerk will have NONE of it. Dude is incredibly rude. He keeps being very confrontational. Like if a colleague (not just me) was getting any sort of acknowledgment, Jerk would belittle them and their accomplishment. If someone was saying they had a rough time with something, Jerk would pop up going ""oh yeah I did that a while back it was SUPER EASY."" Whenever someone tried talking about future plans with me, Jerk would go ""oh yeah we'll see about that"". He also apparently says some very unkind things about my appearance and masculinity, but those at least he had the decency to say behind my back, I suppose, and I only learned about them later. 

Like dude was incredibly mean, for apparently no reason except trying to make himself look better by making everyone else look worse. This one thing wasn't true to me specifically because I'm male, but his meanness seemed to apply especially to women. A few comments were about how working in this field isn't for moms and they should be raising kids or whatever, and some other very bad stuff. But management seemed pretty content keeping him around because apparently he was a pretty good worker and they liked that he was ambitious. Fine. 

My trial period ends. I am offered a permanent position, but decide this is not the place for me, as I don't love being anybody's workhorse, and have very little interest in sticking around in Jerk's vicinity. I respectfully inform them I will not be sticking around and go find work elsewhere. On my last day I come to say goodbye. Management says they're sorry to see me go. Colleagues wish me well & say they're gonna miss me. Jerk goes ""HA! Told you OP wasn't gonna stick around! Good riddance! Maybe this field isn't for you either!"" Very loudly. I leave. I'm not very confrontational & I don't have to deal with him anymore anyway, so I just go. 

Some time goes by, I am now employed elsewhere. I'm happy & doing well. I love my work & my colleagues. I've been promoted, and I don't really think about Jerk anymore, except... 

Apparently there's a relative influx of applicants from Jerk's company? (relative because again - very niche market). Whatever. My boss knows I did a trial period over there, so whenever an applicant comes up - he asks me about my experience with them. 

There are very few people I dislike, so when asked, I usually give my honest opinion, which is usually very positive. But guess who's application we suddenly receive? It's Jerk! My boss asks for my opinion, and I say ""look, I have personal feelings about this person, and I can't be objective"". Boss, knowing just how positive I usually am about basically everyone, asks me what's up, and eventually I tell him. I tell him everything. Jerk, obviously, doesn't get hired. I assume that's the end of that. 

Few days later we have family dinner. My mom goes ""wait, you had a trial period at that company, right? Do you know Jerk?"" Well my mom knew there was a person I really didn't get along with at that company and the shitty things they did. I tell her it was him. Obviously - she ain't gonna hire him either, especially given his views on women. 

So my company ends up hiring one of Jerk's company's former workers. Me & her are on great terms and this is how I discover what happened there - Jerk got promoted and that made a bunch of people wanna leave. This caused management to look into why, and why strong applicants were leaving after their trial period was over. Turned out it was Jerk. Someone had a talk with him and from what I gather he was not receptive to criticism. He was let go. This is when he applied to the company I work for & to my mom's. 

From what I understand he no longer works in our field (there are, as I mentioned, not many employers around), but unfortunately I have no idea what he does do. Will update if I find out. 

[Update: I torpedoed a guy's entire career because he was a bully](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/s/9iQ3UPHpaV)¬† **Nov 7, 2024 (1 month later)** 

So been a minute since my original post. Thing kinda blew up, and that caused me to wanna give a small update and clear some stuff up. 

So first, let me stress that my field is very niche, with few employment opportunities. It is also, as some of you suggested - niche. 

1. Okay okay, seriously now. As some of you actually guessed the field is medicine in a small county. This means that there aren't many spots on the residency program, but also a pretty constant influx of students & interns. The field is pretty lucrative - shitty hours, yes, but great money & a lot of prestige. 

2. Some asked about an exit interview at the end of the trial- had one of those. Said I didn't really vibe with the culture & certain aspects of the way they did things. Didn't name Jerk. 

3. As a young (relatively speaking) specialist in my field in a not very large department - I get to weigh in on potential colleagues, so if I say someone sucks, that bears some weight. And if a department starts having issues attracting the best candidates because its chief resident is a jerk, that's gonna be an issue. 

So with that out of the way, let's get to the update. 

A lot of you were very curious as to what had actually happened to him. So, I reached out to some friends. He's still a doctor (obviously), but he just went into another specialty, which given how long he worked to become chief resident is telling. He does okay probably? 

The reason for the update - it turns out I know his wife. I LIKE his wife - she was a year ahead of me in medschool. Got curious so I texted her. Turns out she's not actually his wife anymore - she's his ex. They got divorced. Had coffee with her, still a lovely woman. She's not on reddit but apparently this thing got on out at some point and reached her? Well I told her about this and she couldn't believe it was me. Except she could, because she suspected it was me because I apparently sound like a twat when I express myself in writing, which she remembers from my days at the student council equivalent and my many, many emails. So... okay? Still, had a good time. We're getting coffee again on Sunday. 

Anyway I didn't have anything to do with his firing, but after he was let go, presumably quite unamicably, he decided to move abroad after not being able to get into another department here. This didn't come to fruition but it DID cause a rift in their marriage, which then led to divorce. So... maybe I kinda torpedoed his marriage too? 

And yeah, that's about it for the update. Will let you know if I get beaten up in a parking lot though, as some of you suggested I might.

1gqxarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1gqxarr/im_a_femcel_that_fell_for_an_incel_and_its_become/,I'm a femcel that fell for an incel and it's become quite painful.,"I'm a 31 yr old voluntarily celibate woman. I'm still a virgin and I haven't dated. I became like this because I'm autistic and I have a masculine personality. I had an absent father and ""acting like a man"" made me feel safer. I tried to transition at one point, causing damage to my breasts from binding, but I realize I could never really be a man so I desisted. I've been depressed and had mental issues for most of my life, so I refrained from dating because I felt too damaged to be a good partner. I haven't had friends since high school, until I met the guy I eventually fell for.

I met a 21 yr old involuntarily celibate man in a server that discusses the state of western civilization, politics, and social issues. When he heard my voice, he thought I was a teenage boy. I didn't care to correct him because I figured I'd never talk to him again. He told me he was an incel in his early twenties and that he hated people, but he resented women in particular because of how poorly they've treated him since he was a kid. He was raised by a radical feminist mother that convinced him to hate his gender to the point where he wanted to transition to escape being ""evil"". His aunt even told him as a child that he could become a rapist because he was male. Growing up, girls were cruel to him in school and constantly made homophobic remarks about him and treated him like a freak because of the way he looked.

He turned on his webcam and showed his tired expression. The contrast of the light from his pc screen against his face in a dark bedroom made him look kind of scary at first. I thought he looked fine though, just tortured by life.

I tried to approach the conversation like a counselor because I'm significantly older than him and it was my first time talking to someone like this. I wanted to understand why he felt misanthropic/nihilistic, so I asked him a lot of questions earnestly. He answered without restraint, though he was well mannered and polite. I've grown up on the internet before it was sanitized, so I wasn't bothered by anything he said. I've probably said edgier things to be honest.

The conversation went on for 3 hrs until some other guys came into the group chat and asked me if I was actually female. I said yeah and I was banned the next day, so I thought it would be the end of it, but the guy I had initially spoken to requested to add me as a friend. I was hesitant, but figured it wouldn't hurt to have someone to talk to.

He contacted me often even after I told him I'm a lot older; I also showed him how I looked when I tried to transition vs what I look like now. I revealed all my deepest, darkest secrets and my struggles with gender identity and health. Nothing repelled him and he opened up to me in the same way. There was no stone left unturned between us, yet every conversation still felt refreshing.

Eventually, I developed feelings for him and he felt the same, but he's trapped in his country for the next 5-10 yrs due to the economy/job market in NZ. The only job he could get was in a slaughter house and that left him traumatized. I encouraged him to leave that job and pursue education; he's happier now, but he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. We continued to talk and now we've known each other for about 4.5 months. He recently told me he doesn't want to go to the US and that I should try to meet someone in Northern Europe because the quality of life is better. I realized I had become naively optimistic about us ever dating. I don't have a lot of time left to decide if I want a family and kids, so I told him I needed some distance to lessen my emotional attachment to him. Otherwise, it would be difficult to date and open up my heart to new people.

I'm still thinking of what he said to me: ""I'm not talking to you because I'm lonely or just because you're a woman. I hang out with my friends often and I care about the quality of conversation I have with people. I still really like you. You're the most introspective, thoughtful, and understanding person I've ever met. It won't bother me if you met someone else because I won't let myself become romantically invested. My life is already too painful. I would like to stay connected with you, but I don't want to waste your time. I'm sorry for continuing to talk to you knowing that I wouldn't be able to date you. It was really cruel to let things get to this point.""

I told him it's not his fault, it was my choice. Right now, I'm trying to focus on improving my health and earning more money. I want to put together a Christmas package for him as a token of gratitude for his friendship (a special edition of his favorite Russian novel, coffee grounds from a local business, a new moka pot, a small plushie resembling his old family cat, and a handwritten letter in a nice Christmas card), but I'm not sure what will happen from here. I'm back to having no friends that I can genuinely connect with. 

After 3 decades, I finally meet someone that ""gets me"" and yet it's futile. What is the way forward?",4,1731560327.0,AskMenAdvice,2,1.0,False

I had my teeth whitened today after years of coffee and tea stains. It was all done by a Dental Assistant. 4 rounds of the chemicals with the blue light for 15 minutes. It was uncomfortable at times but nothing terrible. She was perfectly pleasant and professional and walked me out to reception.

Reception confirmed my next appt time and told me to have a nice day. No aftercare instructions, nothing to avoid (foodwise) and no other information. I left but then walked back in and asked if I needed to wait to eat. The office manager said she didn't know and went back to ask the Dental Assistant, who told her to tell me just to stay away from foods that could stain, specifically red wine, coffee, tea, etc.

I went home and at a sandwich that had (among other things) lunch meat and sauerkraut, and my teeth started tingling and hurting. I looked it up and read several articles that specify first NO ACIDIC FOODS. I didn't realize the enamel is weakened by the bleaching. Now my teeth are feeling pretty uncomfortable. I brushed about a half hour later, not sure that was the right move, but my main question is:

I read that the enamel is (temporarily) weakened after bleaching and that acidic foods can make teeth more sensitive, especially to hot and cold. Is that temporary, also, or could I just have really damaged the enamel on my teeth permanently?

Any advice would be super appreciated. My teeth are feeling pretty tingly and uncomfortable but I don't know if that was likely anyway or if it's a result of eating such acidic food two hours after in-office bleaching, and whether or not I may have damaged my teeth permanently.",1,1731560279.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

JPL was built on a foundation of fearless exploration, creativity, and the desire to push boundaries. But it‚Äôs become clear that leadership has shifted focus away from these values, prioritizing the interests of a single institution over the people who make JPL what it is.

Instead of inspiring bold, innovative work, the focus has shifted to a mindset of ‚ÄòHow cautious can we be?‚Äô JPL‚Äôs culture of fearless exploration and pushing boundaries has given way to processes and decisions that prioritize institutional caution over creativity and mission fulfillment. This approach doesn‚Äôt reflect scientific integrity or real financial responsibility‚Äîit reflects a desire to limit institutional risk rather than foster the impactful work that brought us here.

The layoffs aren‚Äôt just numbers on a spreadsheet. They‚Äôre a loss of expertise, passion, and the very people who enable our missions to succeed. JPL‚Äôs success is in its people, not just in its institutional connections. But without a collective voice, those of us who work tirelessly on JPL‚Äôs groundbreaking projects, making many personal sacrifices, are reduced to a ""workforce gap"" that is ""impacted"".

Unionizing offers us a path forward. It‚Äôs about standing together to demand the respect, stability, and voice we deserve. A union can ensure that decisions made at the top don‚Äôt forget about the mission we‚Äôre all here for. We‚Äôre not just engineers, technicians, education ambassadors, and support staff to be managed away in times of economic uncertainty‚Äîwe *ARE* JPL. By joining together, we can ensure that our contributions are valued, that layoffs are a last resort, and that our voices are included in decisions that impact our futures and the future of space exploration itself.

One of the most powerful actions you can take is simply to talk. Over lunch, during coffee breaks, or in the hallways, start conversations with your colleagues about the possibility of unionizing. Share your concerns, listen to theirs, and discuss the impact that recent changes have had on the work we all care about. By planting this idea in informal, everyday moments, you can help nurture a shared sense of purpose and support. These small conversations can grow, uniting us around the common goal of protecting JPL‚Äôs mission and ensuring that all of us have a say in its future.

1gqx7aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dlifehomeinteriors/comments/1gqx7aj/interior_decorating_tips_for_adding_personality/,Interior Decorating Tips for Adding Personality to Your Space,"When it comes to interior decorating, adding personality to a space is what truly makes it feel like home. A thoughtfully designed room reflects who you are, from your style preferences to your hobbies and even your outlook on life. But how do you go beyond just ‚Äúfilling‚Äù a space with furniture and accessories to create a room that feels vibrant, cohesive, and genuinely you? Here are some tips and tricks compiled by our [interior designers in Kollam ](https://dlifeinteriors.com/location/kollam/)to help you decorate your space with personality, turning a simple room into a unique, expressive environment.

# 1. Define Your Personal Style

Before adding specific items to a room, it‚Äôs helpful to identify your personal style. This doesn't mean you have to follow any particular decor trend, like ‚Äúmodern‚Äù or ‚Äúrustic,‚Äù but rather that you clarify what kind of atmosphere and aesthetics feel right to you. Start by browsing design inspiration‚Äîwhether on social media, in magazines, or by visiting local showrooms. Take note of the color palettes, furniture shapes, textures, and accessories that resonate with you. Over time, you may start to see a pattern or recurring elements that reflect your tastes.

Once you have an idea of what styles you love, create a ‚Äúmood board‚Äù or save images that evoke the look and feel you‚Äôre after. Having this visual reference will help guide your decorating choices and ensure your space is cohesive and authentic to your style.

# 2. Choose a Unique Color Palette

The colors you choose for your home have a powerful impact on its overall feel and can say a lot about you. Color can evoke emotions, making a room feel cozy, cheerful, tranquil, or bold. Instead of opting for generic, neutral tones, consider a color palette that reflects your personality.

For instance, if you love a serene environment, soft blues, greens, or earth tones might be ideal. If you enjoy vibrant and lively settings, opt for bolder shades, like jewel tones, bright yellows, or deep reds. You can introduce these colors in various ways, from painting walls to choosing upholstery, art, and other accessories.

Don‚Äôt shy away from unexpected combinations! A carefully selected color palette with some unique twists will make your space stand out and feel like your own.

Don‚Äôt shy away from unexpected combinations! A carefully selected color palette with some unique twists will make your space stand out and feel like your own.

# 3. Invest in Statement Pieces

A statement piece is a furniture item, work of art, or decor object that becomes the focal point of the room. Statement pieces can add a lot of personality to a space and create memorable visuals. They often spark conversation and showcase your unique style.

Consider investing in an eye-catching sofa, a vintage coffee table, an oversized piece of artwork, or an antique mirror. These pieces will not only draw attention but can also bring a sense of history or creativity to your space. If you‚Äôre an art enthusiast, showcase a favorite painting or a sculpture; if you‚Äôre into antiques, display that one-of-a-kind item you‚Äôve collected.

The key with statement pieces is to let them shine without overwhelming the space. Surround them with simpler items to let their individuality speak for itself.

# 4. Use Layered Textures and Patterns

Layering textures and patterns can give your space a rich, inviting feel. This is especially useful if you have a more neutral color scheme but still want to add interest and personality. Mixing fabrics like velvet, linen, wool, and leather adds depth, while different patterns, such as florals, stripes, or geometrics, can give a room a lively vibe.

For example, mix a plush wool rug with a sleek leather couch and soft cotton pillows. Add patterned throw pillows or a textured wall hanging for more dimension. If you‚Äôre into bohemian or eclectic styles, combining various textures and patterns can really capture the essence of those styles.

Remember, when it comes to patterns, don‚Äôt be afraid to mix and match! Just make sure to balance them with neutral tones or solid colors to keep the room from feeling too busy.

# 5. Incorporate Personal Mementos

Adding personal items like family photos, travel souvenirs, or cherished heirlooms can make a space uniquely yours. These items add emotional value to your decor and can make a space feel truly personal.

Consider framing a few favorite photographs to create a gallery wall or placing travel souvenirs on a shelf. If you have a collection of items‚Äîsuch as vintage cameras, books, or ceramics‚Äîdisplay them together to make a statement. These mementos bring stories and memories into your decor, connecting your life experiences with your environment.

# 6. Play with Lighting

Lighting has a huge impact on the ambiance of a room, and it can help you set a mood that matches your personality. Instead of relying solely on overhead lighting, use a mix of table lamps, floor lamps, and even string lights to create layers of light.

Different types of lighting serve different purposes, and by varying the light sources, you add depth to the room. Warm-toned lights create a cozy, intimate vibe, while brighter, cooler lights make a room feel spacious and energizing. Choosing light fixtures that reflect your style‚Äîwhether modern, vintage, industrial, or rustic‚Äîcan also add a lot of personality to your space.

# 7. Add Greenery and Natural Elements

Plants are a fantastic way to breathe life into a space. They bring color, texture, and a sense of tranquility, making a room feel more vibrant and connected to nature. Houseplants can also be a reflection of your personality; for instance, succulents and cacti convey a low-maintenance vibe, while a lush collection of ferns and flowering plants speaks to a love for nature.

Besides plants, consider other natural elements like wooden accents, stone, or woven textures. Rattan furniture, wooden bowls, or marble tabletops can all contribute to a grounded, organic aesthetic. Natural elements add warmth and depth, making your space feel harmonious and inviting.

# 8. Personalize with Books and Art

Books and art are both fantastic ways to showcase your interests and values. Bookshelves are not only practical storage spaces but also provide an opportunity to display items that matter to you, from favorite novels to unique finds that reveal your interests.

Artwork, in particular, can add an immense amount of character. Choose pieces that you connect with or that reflect themes you enjoy. Art can be anything from paintings and sculptures to handwoven textiles and framed posters. The art on your walls becomes a direct expression of your tastes, so feel free to be eclectic with your choices.

# 9. Experiment with Wall Treatments

Painting the walls isn‚Äôt the only way to add personality to a room. Experiment with unique wall treatments, such as wallpaper, decals, or even a gallery wall. Wallpaper with bold patterns or interesting textures can transform an entire room, while decals offer a more temporary option for renters or those who enjoy frequent changes.

A gallery wall featuring various art pieces, photographs, or mirrors can also be a great way to inject some character. Arrange items in a way that feels organic or go for a more structured, symmetrical setup to suit your taste.

# 10. Trust Your Instincts

While there are many tips and guidelines for decorating, the most important rule is to trust your instincts. After all, this is your space, and it should reflect you. Don't be afraid to take risks or make unconventional choices. Sometimes, the most unexpected combinations or unique decor items make the biggest impact and bring out the true personality of a room.

In conclusion, adding personality to your space is about more than just following trends; it‚Äôs about making intentional choices that reflect your tastes, passions, and lifestyle. From color schemes and textures to statement pieces and personal mementos, each decorating choice has the power to bring you closer to a home that genuinely feels you. So, embrace your creativity, hire a reliable team of [interior designers in India](https://dlifeinteriors.com/), trust your instincts, and let your space tell your story.

Sorry I haven‚Äôt been able to update the subreddit, work has been too crazy. But I was able to go on a two day trip to the LA stop and thought I could at least tell people how the concert was set up.

Mind you this was the first stop and it was chaotic because the staff was overwhelmed but they did a great job getting back on track. So things may change however this may help people plan their concert.

Forgive any errors as I‚Äôm typing this on a flight back home.

‚Äî‚Äî

**CHECKING IN**

Check in starts at 2 pm for Everything, VVIP and VIP.

However people were lined up EARLY (7 am). It was only one line in the beginning however around 1:30pm, they started separating people into different tiers (unfortunately it was messy as it was only one staff member in charge of the line in the beginning and lines had to switch placement throughout the check in process).

This will probably change because it caused a delay in the schedule and Moonbyul staff were not happy. However everyone working rolled with the punches and deserves praise.

However one thing that will not change is the fact¬†**your seat is dependent on what time you line up.**¬†'

Staff will give you a number when you check in and that will be your placement of when you do all the events and placement in the concert.

**IF YOU ARE IN A GROUP,** you need organize and get everyone in your party together before you are checking in at 2pm. If not, you will be separated for the group photo and most likely the seating area.

I would highly recommend making line buddies with your neighbors or at least remembering the people who are next to you on line to help you find your place in line. Together you can organize to get food on the line while you wait.

Also make new moo friends :)

‚Äî‚Äî

**MERCH**

Once you are checked in, you have to re-line up again for Merch. Because the merch was outside in this venue, they lined people up by tiers to get merch.

So EVERYTHING <-VVIP <-VIP <- GA

If you do not want any, you are free to leave as long as you are back before the fansign starts at 4pm. This is the time to get food and go to your car.

***They will also sell merch AFTER the concert.***

But in terms of merch, they seem to have a lot. I can‚Äôt say for sure about the limited signed albums. They had A LOT of them at the venue (5 boxes to be exact) and there wasn‚Äôt a limit really. However this might change at the other stops. So take this with a grain of salt.

If you have not seen the merch, \[here it is from Leo Presents\](https://x.com/LeoPresents/status/1854177129925054610). It‚Äôs ok quality as far as tour merch goes as it's Gildan, however zip up sweater is thinner than it looks.

‚Äî‚Äî

**FANSIGN**

So because of the way it was the first stop, it was a little chaotic. I would recommend bringing your album instead of getting merch from the table signed.

A number of people planned to get the poster from the merch signed but due to the way that everything was pushed, they ran the risk of missing the signing.

***It starts immediately at 4pm and it‚Äôs quick.*** However Moonbyul (who honestly fucked glowed and beautiful in person) tried her best to give everyone a moment with her. She understands more English than you think.

You are allowed to give her small gifts which staff will later take. Letters are very much encouraged. I was able to give her a disposable camera for her to take photos of the tour (we‚Äôll see if she uses it but she was so excited to get it).

She will signed any Moonbyul Merch, however I think there were a couple of people that brought MAMAMOO merch. I got the Selfish Album signed.

She will ask where you would like it signed so be direct with her and enjoy the moment. She was so sweet and an absolute machine at signing.

***There is no phone recording FYI. Staff will stop you*** (but people sneaked it as you can see on the bird app).

‚Äî‚Äî-  
**GROUP PHOTO**

Immediately after the fansign, you line up for the group photo. ***You must stay in the same position as before for it.***

This is why it‚Äôs important to get your group together when checking in or making friends with the line neighbors.

It was a group of 16 in our photos because of the shear amounts of people who were there in LA. Ten in the back and six in the front, three on either side of her.

They line up the back first and then the front. Again super quick and subject to change based off location

‚Äî-  
**SOUNDCHECK**

So after the group photo, they brought us into the venue and you were allowed to sit where you would like. There is no assigned seating so you could pick where you like.

***This is your seat for the soundcheck AND concert.***

Make sure you once again make friends with your seat buddies if you are going alone. It helps to have someone to watch your seat if you have to get up to go to the bathroom or food. It‚Äôs because once soundcheck is over, people will come in and may try to take your seat since it will appear empty if there is no one there.

Make sure you have someone watching your seat because people will ask to sit in an empty seat and it will be a bit before the concert starts. Sound check ended sometime around 6 so there was an hour before the concert started.

This is the last time to go to the bathroom and get food.

‚Äî‚Äî

**CONCERT**

Amazing, I have nothing else to say other than the fact be prepared to get tested on the English and Korean lyrics of her recent songs.

Also she has a moment where she asked the crowd what songs you‚Äôd like to hear from her.

***DO NOT ASK FOR SHUTDOWN, IT WILL COME AND IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL*** (I still haven‚Äôt recovered from Byul personally giving me the most smoldering look I‚Äôve ever seen, people who know me irl can attest to the video)

Please ask for her songs that are not in the concert or song covers she‚Äôs already done in the past.

And enjoy the show, I know I did.

‚Äî-

**HI-TOUCH**

This will happen after the concert if your ticket has it.

***It is a legitimate hi touch, make sure your hands are clean please.*** Let‚Äôs make sure she doesn‚Äôt get sick on this tour.

ALSO SHE HAS THE SOFTEST HANDS EVER. Her high five was so soft too so don‚Äôt put too much power.

‚Äî‚Äî

**ONE ON ONE PHOTO - for EVERYTHING**

If you managed to get the everything photo, this will be where you will line up after the show and get your solo photo with her.

**You will get two chances and it will go QUICK** (as usual). You can request a pose with her, many seemed to do heart poses or peace signs.

(My friends did the everything here so this is their experience. I will get my chance in NYC )

‚Äî‚Äî

Final thoughts, this was an amazing experience and honestly Moonbyul eats her CDs. You can hear all her hard work she‚Äôs being doing, I was so impressed. 

Also god damn her stamina is incredible, not once did I see her energy be anything than 110%

Moonbyul is honestly one of the sweetest and hardworking idols. If you were debating about going to this concert I would highly recommend going as this was such an intimate concert. 

I would go to more of them if it wasn‚Äôt for work as each concert is set up to be unique. But if you can‚Äôt make it, don‚Äôt worry there will be a time one day. She really tried hard to bring her tour to other countries which was why it was so late it‚Äôs really not her fault.

This was probably one of my favorite concerts that I‚Äôve been to this year (it‚Äôs up there with Solar‚Äôs Japan concert this year which was also amazing and I went to four stops for Wheein).

And to everyone I met at the concert, you guys are amazing and can‚Äôt wait to you at future concerts. Welcome to the chaotic radish family.

And everyone else, stop by and say hello in the NYC show, I‚Äôll be in the everything tier with a large coffee.

1gqx3ea,https://i.redd.it/ak61bu4ors0e1.jpeg,What made you want to be a detective?,"(Wrote this fun little thing down to basically flesh out these two and give an insight on their dynamic as well as some Corbin lore! Enjoy!)

Yelena had questions. She had a lot of questions.

Her number of questions were as many as the random scars she would notice all over Corbin‚Äôs body. How did he get those scars? Why? Is he still in danger? 

As the questions ran through her head, Corbin sat across from her, delicately holding and sipping a cup of black coffee. His dark lashes flutter closed as he takes a slow and steady sip. He was not wearing his full suit and hat, rather he simply wore a white button up with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Despite such a small amount of skin being revealed, scars littered all over his arms and that one noticeable scar around his neck made itself oh so clear. 

‚ÄúAsk.‚Äù Corbin simply demanded, snapping Yelena out of her daze. ‚ÄúKhm?‚Äù Yelena simply replied, lifting her head from her palm. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a question, ask.‚Äù Corbin simply replied, his golden eyes staring directly at Yelena. Yelena focused her gaze at his arms. 

‚ÄúHow did it all happen?‚Äù She asked, not exactly sure how to phrase her question. Corbin let out a satisfied hum, a smirk painted on his pale lips. 

‚ÄúYou need to work on your questions but your curiosity is on par with an actual detective.‚Äù Corbin praised and Yelena fought back a groan. Did he really need to make this into a lecture? 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think I can‚Äôt see you rolling your eyes.‚Äù Corbin simply stated when Yelena didn‚Äôt give a response. ‚ÄúIt was a compliment.‚Äù He then added, taking another sip of his coffee. 

‚ÄúYour compliments suck, Mr. Baudelaire.‚Äù Yelena simply replied, pouting her cheeks. Corbin let out a small, amused huff. It could hardly be considered a laugh. 

This was the most animated she‚Äôs seen Corbin in a while. He‚Äôs always been so grim and serious during the investigations so it was almost refreshing to see him be a‚Ä¶ her eyes darted back to the scars. Right, she was asking him about those. 

‚ÄúWell now I asked, you have to answer.‚Äù She then said, imitating Corbin‚Äôs demanding tone. Corbin raised an eyebrow. 

‚ÄúBut Detective Popova, you haven‚Äôt made your objective clear. How can I answer such a vague question?‚Äù Corbin replied, his expression relaxed as he leaned against the chair. Yelena huffed, she really didn‚Äôt like how he was trying to make this into yet another lesson. 

‚ÄúYour scars, darn it! You have so many, how does that even happen?!‚Äù Yelena exclaimed. 

 ‚ÄúBien jou√©.‚Äù Corbin quietly praised, crossing his arms to give Yelena a good view.
 
‚ÄúHaving an ability like mine makes living a normal life very difficult but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve figured that out as much. I‚Äôm always in close proximity with death, even in candid moments like this. These‚Ä¶‚Äù Corbin began and paused, his eyes glancing over at his scars. 

‚ÄúTell many stories of how my life could‚Äôve ended. Being able to see, hear, and speak with the dead makes them desire your company. Their desire for your company is a heavy burden to bear, to say the least.‚Äù Corbin explained. He takes a deep breath before continuing. 

‚ÄúWe would be here for a very long time if I went through the story behind each and every one, that is if I can even remember them all‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt call an existence like mine sorrowful but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a blessing either. It‚Äôs just. A life that is mine and mine alone.‚Äù Corbin said, finishing his explanation. 

Yelena didn‚Äôt feel entirely satisfied with the answer, its vagueness bothered her. She pursed her lips. ‚ÄúWhy did you become a detective?‚Äù She asked. 

‚ÄúDaring, are we?‚Äù Corbin asked, a smile on his face. Yelena decided to double down. ‚ÄúKaneshna! You‚Äôre so mysterious it‚Äôs bothering me!‚Äù Yelena exclaimed. 

‚ÄúVery well, I‚Äôll tell you a story. As a young boy, I once attended a funeral of one of our neighbors. She was a lovely lady, kind to everyone and genuinely liked by the community. At the funeral, her husband came to the podium and gave a very heartfelt speech, the audience wept with him but yet‚Ä¶ I saw her. Her face haunts me, it was one I‚Äôve never seen on her. She was angry, betrayed, and hurt. It was as if she had wanted to scream at the rest of us for crying with him.‚Äù Corbin explained. 

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù Yelena responded, her jaw wide open. 

‚ÄúSurely, you‚Äôve figured out the truth in that story, no?‚Äù Corbin asked. 

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ was lying, wasn‚Äôt he?‚Äù Yelena responded, slightly hesitant in her judgment. 

‚ÄúOui, he was deceiving us. He had murdered his own wife in cold blood and showed up to the funeral playing the part of a grieving husband. The worst part was that he got away with it. I was the only one who knew the truth but I didn‚Äôt have the evidence to prove it. He married a woman much younger than him and left the country right after.‚Äù Corbin stated, finishing his story. 

‚ÄúBut that didn‚Äôt answer my question, why did you become a detective?‚Äù Yelena persisted, unsatisfied with the story. 

‚ÄúA detective who needs it spelled out for her, huh? Very well, I‚Äôll allow it since this is just a mere conversation. I became a detective because of a foolish sense of justice, just like every other detective.‚Äù Corbin simply answered. He then lifted his coffee mug and took a sip, as if to tell Yelena that he had no interest in elaborating. 

‚ÄúCome to think of it, I think I was told that you specialized in cold cases, right?‚Äù Yelena asked. Corbin just gave her a slight nod. Yelena let out an enthusiastic gasp. 

‚ÄúYou became a detective so you can let those angry spirits rest in peace knowing that the real culprit was caught and facing the punishment of their crime! Right? Right? I‚Äôm totally right!‚Äù Yelena enthusiastically spouted, slamming her hands on the table and standing upright. 

Corbin put down his coffee mug and smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not bad.‚Äù He simply said. Yelena pouted. ‚ÄúCmon, give me a little more credit!‚Äù She insisted. 

‚ÄúBien jou√©. Don‚Äôt let it get to your head.‚Äù Corbin simply replied as he got up from the table. ‚ÄúWe have to prepare for the day now but next time, I‚Äôd like to hear your reason.‚Äù He said as he pushed his chair in. 

For today, that sufficed.

The wonderful aspect of immortality is the *detachment* of it all ‚Äì the ability to distance yourself from others, the chance to be able to see from a purely objective lens. And when you see life in that way, it‚Äôs incredible the discoveries you make.

Take, for instance, one particularly wizened woman. She wasn‚Äôt particularly sick ‚Äì in fact, by most humans‚Äô standards, she was the picture of health. She was still walking, still talking, still laughing, still working, even ‚Äì in fact, we met at the small corner caf√© at the edge of the town we lived in at the time (even immortals need their energy). I saw her standing at the counter, her gray hair tightly curled, her face covered in smile marks and bright, intelligent brown eyes. Her small, contented grin as she went about her work amused me ‚Äì and intrigued me. Of all the humans I had met, she herself seemed to be one of the most fulfilled I had ever met. How strange it was!

As I gave my coffee order ‚Äì no, tea for today ‚Äì with a small smile, she punched it in with remarkable swiftness. Certainly faster than I would be able to, despite my physical form being nearly fifty years her junior. As she finished the order, I waited for her to ask for my name. Already, I had been thinking of a thousand different names ‚Äì Perhaps an X name today. Xavier? Xander? ‚Äì I paused as she stopped to gaze at me quietly. I watched a soft smile spread across her face as she let out a long, deep sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prepare your order and we can talk over there.‚Äù I watched her gesture towards a booth towards the east side of the caf√©.

Surprised, I nodded, turning and heading towards the bench. And as I sat, I immediately understood why she asked for this spot. In the mid-morning in which we were, the sun hit this particular booth and window with such‚Ä¶ warmth! To feel the sun on my skin, to take a deep breath as the scents of nectar and sweet flowers wafted into my nose from across the street‚Ä¶ It was wonderful. And for a moment, I felt myself transported nearly a thousand years into the past.

That is, until I heard the small clattering of two mugs on the table, and a small grunt as she sat down. ‚ÄúOld joints,‚Äù she apologized.

‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù I smiled, gazing down at her. ‚ÄúTake your time.‚Äù

She slid the mug over to me with a slight tremble to her hand, grinning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you ordered this one. It‚Äôs one of my favorites.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúIs it, now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is.‚Äù She smiled, warming her hands on her own cup. ‚ÄúDidn't you order it on purpose?‚Äù

I gazed at her for a moment before I chuckled. ‚ÄúNo, no. I did.‚Äù I lifted it to my lips, taking a deep sip. It was an herbal tea ‚Äì a blend of chamomile and cardamom, all at once sweet and refreshing. And yet, there was a spice to it that made it quite warm...

‚ÄúHow is it?‚Äù The woman asked.

‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù I nodded with a gentle smile. ‚ÄúThis may be my new regular order from now on ‚Äì even after all this.‚Äù

‚ÄúGlad to hear.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúI made an extra-large batch for us both. Though‚Ä¶ perhaps a mug isn‚Äôt quite refined enough for one as experienced as you, however. And I'm not even sure how long this conversation's gonna be before... well. You want something nicer?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo, no ‚Äì this is quite nice. Honestly, the small little teacups they always gave us even a century ago was never enough.‚Äù 

""Right?"" 

We both chuckled, and I took another sip before setting my mug down onto the table.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I assume you‚Äôre here on my account, then?‚Äù Her gaze fell, and yet a smile remained on her face.

I sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve caught on from a simple order... Most baristas don‚Äôt even notice that detail.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be my age showing,‚Äù she admitted, chuckling a bit. ‚ÄúUs old folk tend to notice these sorts of things, now, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù She winked at me.

I laughed. ‚ÄúThat we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBesides, you wouldn‚Äôt be doing anything so tailored to me unless you were here on my behalf, now would you?‚Äù She smirked ‚Äì almost devilishly, as if she had caught a grandchild stealing cookies.

‚ÄúHmm. I try not to.‚Äù I gazed out the window across the street to the park beyond; the children laughing and playing in the playground, happy parents watching as they chatted quietly. 

‚ÄúYou really *are* interesting, aren't you?""

""Hmm?"" I responded, still gazing out the window. ""How so?""

""Well, I expected you to be more... dark, and broody. More skeletal. Maybe a scythe."" She took another long sip of her tea. ""But I've gotta say -- I like this a whole lot better.""

""Is that so?"" 

""Yes, sir! And don‚Äôt you worry -- I‚Äôve lived my life as well as I could, and I figured it was only a matter of time before the Reaper‚Äôs bell tolled for me, too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt speak, simply turning back to the woman. The sunlight that shone around her seemed to mask her wrinkles and illuminate her hair, and for just a moment, it seemed as if she were nearly thirty years younger. She, like all who I visited, was beautiful. I watched as she took a sip from her mug, gently setting it on the table as she gazed into it. 

‚ÄúWell, now.‚Äù She raised her eyebrows before turning to me with a wide smile. ‚ÄúFor a woman‚Äôs last batch of tea, I did pretty darn good, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù

We laughed, the liquid shimmering ever so slightly as we both took another sip. Finally, I sighed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Evelynn Hunter.‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúYou have lived a long and good life, but‚Ä¶ as you have surmised, it is your time.‚Äù

This, of course, was my least favorite part. To watch their faces as their eyes fill with panic, their gaze darkening, the beginning of loss setting in. And yet that smile I had seen from the very beginning remained ‚Äì an almost wistful recollection, a memory‚Ä¶ an acceptance.

She truly *was* even wiser than she seemed.

‚ÄúAre you not frightened?‚Äù I asked softly.

‚ÄúWhy would I be?‚Äù She turned to me curiously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived my life the way I‚Äôve wanted to. I‚Äôve done the things I‚Äôve wanted to, and I‚Äôve been on my feet ‚Äòtill the day I died. No better way to go out, if you ask me!‚Äù

I regarded her curiously.

‚ÄúAnd besides ‚Äì I‚Äôve made my mark on the world. Nothing too big, nothing too small. Just right, I think.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúJust enough to make sure people are smiling at my funeral instead of crying.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Remarkable.‚Äù I noted under my breath.

‚ÄúIs it really? You mean you haven‚Äôt had any of those thoughts before?‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúThough, an immortal probably wouldn‚Äôt need to think of such things, would he?‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúNo, I've had those thoughts before. Many times, truthfully.""

‚ÄúThen what‚Äôs gotten you all shook up? An old woman at peace with her death? Surely that's more common than otherwise?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no‚Ä¶ not that.‚Äù I mused. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your eyes. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ hopeful. May I ask something?""

""Go for it.""

""Do you not have any regrets?‚Äù

Of course I knew the answer. But whenever someone was at peace like this... I wanted to know.

She, in turn, regarded me with a curious glance before her brows furrowed. ‚Äú‚ÄôCourse I have regrets.‚Äù She scoffed in mock anger. ‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs life but fixin‚Äô em to make more?‚Äù

I gazed into her eyes, thinking before finally replying. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ No one‚Äôs perfect. Only God.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúBut honestly? Sometimes I think I‚Äôve made more mistakes than most. But I‚Äôve lived my life trying to be the best I can ‚Äì being honest, owning up, moving forward. And now that I‚Äôm here ‚Äì with kids, grandkids ‚Äì heck, *great* grandkids? It was all for a reason.‚Äù She smiled softly. ‚ÄúSo of course I have regrets. But I‚Äôm not torn about them. If anything, I‚Äôm proud of them.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ To learn such wisdom in only eighty years.‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you go boastin‚Äô your age at me, sir!‚Äù She narrowed her eyes in an impish grin. ‚ÄúI wonder if it took you longer ‚Äòcause you never had to worry about dying. You ever think about *your* life?‚Äù

‚ÄúW-well, of course I have.‚Äù I sat up a little straighter. ‚ÄúI am an angel of death, after all. Death and life are inseparable.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, then you‚Äôve probably thought about all the people you‚Äôve taken with you, too, seeing as you‚Äôve been around a lot longer than me. And yeah, makes sense that you'd be thinkin' about your own death, hmm? And probably a lot -- I‚Äôm probably just a kid compared to you!‚Äù She play-punched my arm.

I laughed. ‚ÄúA matter of perspective, is all.‚Äù

‚ÄúDang right.‚Äù She sighed, glancing back at the baristas working the shift. ‚ÄúHoo‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre gonna probably be traumatized by seein‚Äô an old dead woman‚Äôs body in the booths, eh? Any chance we could, uh... take this somewhere else?‚Äù

I sighed. ""They say how one dies reflects how one lives... and even at the gates, you still think of others."" I chuckled. ‚ÄúPerhaps we could take a walk around the park for a bit. See this town you‚Äôve lived in for quite some time. Then once you've returned home... I'll bring you with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow *that‚Äôs* an idea!"" She slammed the table with her fist excitedly before gulping down the rest of her tea. ""Give me a moment ‚Äì I‚Äôll take my break, okay?‚Äù

I watched her as she nearly ran to the counter to talk to the others. Just how long had she been waiting for? How long had she been thinking about it all?

And how was it that after all these years, all of these souls I've guided... how is it that even amongst them all, I was still surprised by the ones like these?

‚ÄúI get to go out with such a strapping young man on my arm!‚Äù She laughed loudly as she returned. ‚ÄúWait ‚Äòtill Peter hears about this one ‚Äì he‚Äôll be jealous, I‚Äôm sure of it!‚Äù

I smiled, standing and offering my elbow. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt find out? After the tour, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúHah! Sounds like a plan.‚Äù

As we stepped towards the door, I quietly smiled, my mind holding fast to a single thought.

After all that, I still have yet to meet a human with no regrets.

But perhaps that is what makes death all the more beautiful.

1. You can‚Äôt control how others‚Äô actions affect you or what life throws your way. The only thing within your control is your own actions‚Äîso treat others with kindness.
2. Never underestimate the importance of exercise for your mind, body, and soul.
3. It‚Äôs true: we accept the love we think we deserve. You can love someone deeply, but if they don‚Äôt love themselves, they won‚Äôt see what you see. Love yourself so when you find someone who loves you, it‚Äôs a healthy match.
4. Listen to your body‚Äîit knows you better than your mind does. When you‚Äôre worn down, it will show; when you‚Äôre stressed, you may see acne or fatigue. Understand your normal and recognize the signs when something feels off.
5. The Enneagram is a helpful tool for understanding people‚Äôs motivations, but remember, everyone is unique.
6. Music is powerful. There‚Äôs a song for every moment: for releasing tears, celebrating, processing loss, or finding joy.
7. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to do things alone. Go to the movies, enjoy a meal, grab a coffee, or take a walk solo. Sometimes, your own company is all you need, and no one‚Äôs judging‚Äîthey‚Äôre likely wishing they could do the same.
8. Money often equals time, especially at this stage. Choose between being time-rich or money-rich wisely; money may make life easier, but time enriches it. Sometimes, taking an unappealing job is necessary for survival, but it‚Äôs temporary‚Äîit‚Äôs all part of your journey.
9. Time heals. Let yourself cry, explore a new hobby, talk or write about your feelings, and surround yourself with supportive people. Day by day, you‚Äôll see how far you‚Äôve come.
10. No matter your age, you‚Äôll never have everything perfectly together‚Äîno one does. Be kind to your elders and patient with younger people; we‚Äôre all figuring it out.
11. Loyalty is valuable, but sometimes you need to be selfish and know when to let go. If something affects your well-being, whether it‚Äôs a job, a community, or a relationship, it‚Äôs okay to move on.
12. Mental health impacts every aspect of life. Take care of it‚Äîit‚Äôs essential.
13. Not all lectures or lessons will be meaningful, but they‚Äôre only temporary. Persevere through them.
14. Working on things you‚Äôre passionate about is incredibly rewarding; don‚Äôt underestimate its impact.
15. Stop making excuses. Learn that language, pick up that instrument, or start that hobby. You have the time if you step away from Netflix.
16. Your relationship won‚Äôt fill every need‚Äîand it‚Äôs okay. They‚Äôre your person, but don‚Äôt expect them to fulfill every role. Build other friendships to complement your relationship.
17. Choose your words carefully. Avoid speaking out of anger or heartbreak; take time to gain perspective, then say what‚Äôs truly needed.
18. Heartbreak happens, whether in romance or friendships. People grow and change. Appreciate the time you shared and wish them well.
19. How someone speaks about others‚Äîexes, family, friends‚Äîreflects how they might treat you. Pay attention; it reveals more than words can say.
20. Climate change is real. While you can‚Äôt do everything, small actions help. Use reusable bags, cups, and straws. Start small and make bigger changes as you can.
21. Know your worth. Recognize your non-negotiables and your compromises in friendships, relationships, work, and school.
22. In 10, 5, 2, or even 1 year, you‚Äôll be a different person. Whether you choose to grow positively or let life shape you passively is up to you.",4,1731559371.0,Life,4,0.67,False

Recent market data shows this carat weight remains particularly popular in European markets for fine jewelry and Asian markets where buyers prioritize quality over size.¬†

The correct setting choice can increase your diamond's perceived size by up to 30%, with halo settings being the most effective option. Our analysis shows that half carat diamonds in optimal settings can appear similar to 0.75 ct solitaires, while costing 40-50% less.

This guide provides specific strategies for maximizing your half carat diamond's appearance and value, from setting selection to clarity grade recommendations, all backed by current market data and expert analysis.

# Bottom Line

When considering a half carat diamond engagement ring, here's what you need to keep in mind:

* **Perfect Balance of Size and Affordability**: A half carat diamond (0.50 ct) offers an appealing combination of visual impact and price. It typically measures about 5.1 mm in diameter and is ideal for budget-conscious buyers looking for something beautiful without breaking the bank.
* **Quality Matters**: The cut quality significantly affects the diamond's sparkle and perceived size. Opt for a well-cut diamond to ensure it reflects light beautifully, enhancing its brilliance.
* **Setting Selection**: The right setting, such as a halo or three-stone design, can create the illusion of a larger diamond and add to its overall appeal. Selecting a slim band can also help make the diamond stand out more.

* **Key Pricing Insights**: Prices for half carat diamonds generally fall between $400 and $2,500, with high-quality options available up to $3,800. Always compare various options to find the best balance of quality and price.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-savvy individuals wanting a quality diamond.
* Those looking for a balance between size and affordability.

# Who is this not for?

* Those who prefer larger, more prominent stones.
* Buyers seeking extremely high-end, high carat weight diamonds.
* Individuals with larger hands who might find a 0.50 ct stone too small.
* Those with a more flexible budget who can afford larger diamonds.



# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: A well-cut diamond will appear larger and more brilliant than a poorly cut one of the same carat weight.
2. Consider clarity carefully: For a 0.50 ct diamond, aim for SI1 clarity or better. At this size, inclusions are less noticeable, so you can often get away with a lower clarity grade without visible imperfections.
3. Choose the right setting: Opt for a halo or three-stone setting to enhance the appearance of the center stone.

1. Compare prices: Shop around and compare prices from different retailers to ensure you're getting the best value.
2. Use visualization tools: Take advantage of 360-degree viewing and magnification tools offered by online retailers to inspect diamonds closely.
3. Consider lab-grown diamonds: These can offer significant savings while providing the same visual qualities as natural diamonds.

1. Don't forget about the band: A thin band can make the diamond appear larger in comparison.
2. Get a grading report: Ensure the diamond comes with a reputable grading report (GIA or AGS) to verify its quality.

1gqwwlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gqwwlc/they_tried_to_get_me_arrested_and_ended_up_being/,they tried to get me arrested and ended up being served a protective order.,"writing this on adrenaline. it feels like the last five hours were over in a blink.

my pwBPD (undiagnosed) has been abusing me since i was in a play back in the spring. they were triggered by a stage kiss and screamed at me, blaming me for their suicidal impulses.

things have spiraled since then. over the last several months, i have been berated and lifted up in the same breath, screamed at while they begged me for ""better comfort,"" and had suicide ideation thrown at me as a tactic.

lately, they decided that i have trapped them here in a very small, rural town. it was always our mutual dream to move to an idyllic, quiet, artsy place, and we really did find somewhere beautiful. the view from our kitchen windows is like a piece of art. they said they have to rely on me for everything - they have no job (i have paid all bills for the majority of our 6+ year relationship while they made elaborate promises of future wealth with no attempt at following through), no family or friends (they've made no attempts to socialize since moving here and cut off their entire family - and they were slowly encouraging me to do the same). 

they had to ruin everything that i did publicly, usually by making it about them. at one of our last big outings, a writing festival i helped organize, they got angry when another friend sat in their chair when they left for the bathroom. i pulled up another but they went to another table to sulk, later ranting to me for an extended period outside about the injustice of it all.

over the last two weeks, they've supposedly had a ""breakthrough,"" which i can only attribute to adderall psychosis given the way they abuse their prescription. during this, they allegedly realized that they had been abusive. they were experiencing deep paranoia and believed we were all in a prison created by artificial intelligence. when they came to, i was their reason for living, the literal center of their universe. we were going to take on the world. they re-proposed to me, but quickly got upset when they said that they perceived me to be upset with the first time they proposed three years ago. this was also around the time they admitted that they didn't actually love me during the first half of our relationship and felt that they were settling when they asked me to marry them.

last week, they accused me of cheating on them. i write fanfiction, sometimes collaboratively. they found a scene in which two characters were dating and everything spiraled. they sexually assaulted me and then accused me of ""playing chess"" when i took anxiety medication to quell a panic attack. i should have been taking care of them, after all. things went quickly downhill. i've been experiencing literally daily bouts of lovebombing and discard, and it's been exhausting. my work and relationships have suffered.

last night, they admitted to gaslighting me into a vulnerable space to tell them why resentment had built up in our relationship. they then backed me into a corner to get me to admit that i had systematically abused them for years.

which brings us to today (if you're still reading this, you're a saint). it started off well. then it slipped when we needed to repair the showerhead - they accused me of hiding the screwdrivers over and over. felt like tv static in my head. they asked how to feed the cats in the morning, which requires medication. they insisted that they could and would be taking this on. at the time, i thought nothing of it.

then, after finding compromised passwords, had a realization about their past and their cycles and got angry at me for being ""the same as everyone else."" then, they went on to talk to their AI chatbot for hours. they seemed like they were calming down until they smoked cbd. they came up to my office, said they were feeling weird, and then pointedly accused me of lacing the herb. 

sorry - let's rewind a sec. this isn't an accusation out of the blue. they literally said last night that they were afraid i was going to hurt them or our three cats, threatening to ""fuck me up"" if i did anything to theirs. i have never once harmed them or our animals, and i told them this. but anyway. the cbd. definitely poisoned, right? couldn't be the adderall mixed with a rising time of 4:30 am mixed with the meds wearing off mixed with a full pot of coffee mixed with pacing all day and no food, right? nah, poison is definitely the go-to here.

we go on a walk. i can see the lightbulb flash above his head and the mischief in his eyes. he asks me about my anxiety meds. i'd counted them, right? let's go count them again, and if there are less, then that's definitive proof i've poisoned them. we come back. we count them. there are more than they thought. 

note - i remember earlier this week that they made a comment about my pill box where i keep these. i actually had no idea where it was at the time. i highly, highly, highly suspect they stole one and were planning this.

they still believe i poisoned them. we go back out. they want to head toward town, ""so if they get disoriented and fall, others will see."" what they actually want to do is take me to the police station. they ask me several times how i would react if they called 911. at the same time, they're barking at me to comfort them more while they continue to lobby the claims of poisoning at me. we end up at a gas station and run into a neighbor, to whom they say that they are either having a severe anxiety attack or i have poisoned them. neighbor tells us to call 911. we do. fiance takes the phone, but the dispatcher is skeptical. an ambulance comes anyway, along with two officers who speak to me. the cops don't believe my fiance  and detect some mental health issues. after i answer some questions related to my fianc√©'s behavior over the last week, they recommend that i take out a protective order.

my fiance goes in the ambulance. i go to the station. fiance calls me, tells me they're walking home, says the emts confirmed poisoning wasn't likely (shocker!!!). meanwhile i am filling out order forms.

i won't lie, i almost went back on it. this small town pd has video of me having a breakdown on the phone to my mom, but i did it. i can't express the relief i had when i heard that the cops successfully served the order. 

looking back on this day alone, the poisoning, the sudden uptake of responsibility and care for the animals, the insinuation that i would hurt them... they were literally trying to get me arrested, weren't they? play stupid games, win stupid prizes, i guess.

tonight, i won't lie, i'm scared. i worry they'll try to violate the order, but they have no keys or access to the home that isn't forceful. there's also the strangest sense of quiet and relief. one of the cats that has been afraid of them is rolling around playfully. tomorrow is going to be a new, stressful day - the cats and i are driving away after a visit to the courthouse. the police are patrolling our area extra vigilantly tonight.

i'm also reflecting on a lot of my codependent tendencies that have kept me in relationships like this one. this is so, so, so fucking wild. i think i'm ready to not date for a minute.

anyway. idk why i'm still going. thanks for understanding. be safe, y'all, it's wild out here.",5,1731558928.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

They are telling her to hold on to me so if me saying I want to breakup or take a break (keep in mind it is going to be a long). She works at her dad‚Äôs store here and there and she always gets money as she is on the payroll list even she doesn‚Äôt work. I am very responsible with my money, but I live in a very expensive city and I am trying to find a second job. My dad has been putting pressure on me as he has accomplished a lot at 25 and i haven‚Äôt done anything. 

Please let me know what I should do. This girl really loves me and I don‚Äôt think she is going to let me walk away from her and the fact that I met her family and they say good things about me. I am lost. I was thinking about telling her to open a joint account together so we can save monthly for our future together. I don‚Äôt know if it is too early for that? Knowing that we don‚Äôt live together but something she can spend 3 weeks straight at my place. I will still pay for my expenses on my own like I usually. The joint account would be for collective expenses like buying gifts for her family and mine for Christmas, buying gifts for her brother‚Äôs engagement party, or travel. She was raised rich so travelling is common for her but not me. I am all about the hustle and working hard. I got her to the gym at 5 in the morning, improving her resume, telling her to finish her university degree. 
Any advice would be appreciated. ",1,1731558683.0,AskMenAdvice,9,1.0,False

1gqwreu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gqwreu/is_it_wierd_to_ask_a_girl_for_relationship/,Is it wierd to ask a girl for relationship directly?,"I (25M then) went on 5-6 dates (I assume they were dates) with a girl (25F then) in a span of 2 months (coz I was free only on some weekends). She looked interested in the beginning but one day she showed a clear sign of uninterest so I stopped texting her. But then she started texting me, and when she texted like 3 times, I thought may be I read the sign wrong, so I once again invited her to hangout and she agreed.

Once we went together at a party and she said, ""We can do a lot of things together, not just music."" Am I wrong to think of this as her being interested? I can't imagine friends (especially opposite gender) making these statements.

Once again we decided to meet for coffee, and when we were walking together, we talked a bit about relationships and she said something like, ""If you need a relationship, you should just say it."" Again, I thought of it as a hint, may be she wants me to say it. So when we were leaving, I asked her for a relationship directly and her rejection was really bad: ""NOOOOO, I DON'T  HAVE TIME FOR ALL THIS, I HAVE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO."" It was so confident ""No"" that it made me think like she was never interested and all my judgements were wrong, because if she was even a bit, it wouldn't have been this bad.

Now 5 months have passed and I am still not able to move on from it and feel stupid of doing it. I know what could be wrong: we didn't build a good connection and I still asked her. But is it really completely my fault? I can't stop feeling stupid.",2,1731558429.0,dating,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been dating a guy I met on a dating app for about two weeks. We got a drink on a Thursday, went for coffee and a walk the following Sunday, and then to dinner this past Saturday and I slept over his place afterwards.

The night after our first date, he told me ‚Äúhe did a thing.‚Äù When I asked what it was, he sent a screenshot of deleting his dating apps. I asked why he did that and he responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm over it.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think much into this besides that he was frustrated with dating apps and was hopeful towards our next date. 

When I told him I went to a bar for a drink one night last week, he texted back to ask ‚Äúare these other dates you‚Äôre going on?‚Äù to which I responded ‚Äúnope, just catching up with a friend tonight.‚Äù 

After dinner on Saturday, he asked if I had been going on dates with other people and I told him that I had declined a few recently. 

Fast forward to today, he asked where I went last night and I told him I went out with a guy who had been asking me out for a while, but that I was most excited about seeing him (the guy I had been on three dates with) again. We didn‚Äôt have any plans yet for a fourth date and so I had been feeling uncertain about where we stood after I slept over. 

He responded back saying ‚ÄúYeah I knew something was up tbh. Well it was nice spending the time I did with you. You were the only one I was talking to and respected you enough to not entertain anyone else. I‚Äôm not going to deal with trying to keep your attention on me when I had all mine on you.‚Äù 

He also said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what ‚Äúgoing out with friends‚Äù looks like in many different way courtesy of my past relationships and my gut feeling has never been wrong.‚Äù

I asked him if he would be willing to talk through this in person to which he declined. Although this was only three dates, I am feeling pretty hurt and confused as I never intended to make him feel disrespected and I really did like him a lot. I have been burned in the past for rushing into relationships and so I thought I was doing the right thing by taking it slow and trying to be transparent in his questioning. I wish he would have more explicitly spoken to me about wanting to become exclusive. I felt a bit blindsided by this as we have never discussed being in a relationship or as a couple.

I asked him if he would give me a few minutes on the phone and he said ‚ÄúNot tonight. I‚Äôm not making conversation when I‚Äôm upset like this.‚Äù

I just wanted to vent productively and hopefully gain a little insight from you guys here about your study practices in residency.

some background. I have been sitting on the results of my ITE exams and they have been disappointing to say the least. scored well below average and it shot my confidence. Since then, i worked hard to study for the step 3, took that damn test with gastroenteritis and 2 hours of sleep, and scored around the same percentile i did as my step 2/1 scores (and above average too). Still, after the ITEs i've lost some confidence. I don't know how i can retain all this information long term and wanted to reach out to you all here for advice. I have a couple of questions (try to keep them short):

What do you think about using Anki in residency? I cannot find an MI-specific deck with up-to-date treatment guidelines. I'd like to start, but i don't want it to be a waste of time either. 

What text books or resources are good to study more about a particular disease or find quick answers? What do you think about Amboss for residency? We use Dynamed and I'll be honest it can be a great resource if you know what you're looking for. I just get lost in all that information. 

What other strategies do you use to keep your clinical info sharp? Spaced repetition? note taking? pacing around like a madman muttering about salts and pressures?

and finally, i'm kinda frustrated about the disconnect between my ITE scores and my Steps. I feel like i was a good medical student but im missing something preventing me from transitioning into a good resident. have any of you experienced this; how can i fix this for myself?

Melona (yes like the ice cream)

Id travel across the bridge for this alone. The execution is on point and refined. As its in Milford its nothing overly experimental. This will become a firm favourite with the local boomers and foodies alike. 

I wish they sold the Melona cocktail in 20L take home kegs cos 3 is definitely not enough

My mam says I shouldn't do this. As does my husband. But honestly I'm so mad. 

My step brother (John 37) married Jenny (31) nearly a year ago. 

When they first announced their engagement I was happy for him. Me and my step bro are (were I guess) really close and used to see each other every week. We'd go out for the day shopping, have lunch etc. 

However. Once he met Jenny he stopped coming over, now I understand new partner, honey moon phase etc and that's fine. But he promised to take me for a meal for my birthday and he just never bothered. 3x he arranged it and didn't show. 

Fast forward to the engagement he asks off I'll attend the wedding (I have health issues) I said yes ofc, wouldn't miss my little bro getting married. 

Fast forward to a few weeks before the wedding. Dispute asking I've not heard and news on location or times. Just a date. 

Then a few weeks before the wedding he pops over and out of the blue says it would be easier if my family didn't go. (Myself, hubby and kids) No explanation. 

I still messaged him and wished him a good day on Facebook. No hard feelings right. Sure he had his reasons. 

However my 40th birthday was last week and he didn't even so much as text. 

Now this is weird. Cos even when he wants working hed always pop in and say happy birthday and have a coffee with me. He'd even grab a cheap can of pop and chocolate bar. Just so I had something, and he certainly always had some type of card. 

I've later found out he's been visiting other family members including my older brother he said he hated. 

I haven't done it said anything offensive about him. And myself and his wife got along great the few times we met. I've gone out of my way to figure out stuff to buy her for Xmas and her birthday. I'm at a loss as to the problem. 

So WIBTA if I didn't include them in my Christmas gift list? To clarify. He's bought my hubby and my kids birthday gifts. 

I just also wanted to add. If I don't buy him Christmas presents he will 100% shit talk me to family etc. I don't like Christmas anyway. I think it's over hyped and way too  competitive now we have social media. So it's not about the gifts. It's about. The time being spent with each other. 

But the none giving of gifts will certainly start something in the family.

When was the last time you wrote a IAC script from scratch ? 
To which I honestly answered : 3 months ago .

He said : ‚Äúyou must be writing iac scripts everyday at this role so not having written for 3 months is a red flag ‚Äú.

Pardon me ???
The question mentioned ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù 
Who here write terraform from zero every day ? 

Also as a consultant , I don‚Äôt have to code every day , there is time for design, documentation, customer discussion, problem resolution , deployment and so on 

I didn‚Äôt apply to a Software Development role where I can understand coding is most of the role .

I think this recruiter is not knowledgeable of what an Architect is.
It is even on the job description, the responsibilities are Design ,Cross functional collaboration , modernize systems, advise client , educate customers, etc 

It s pretty frustrating that recruiters are able to destroy your application based on their own lack of knowledge.

I knew I had a severe allergy to tree nuts, specifically almonds and pecans, if I eat them, but I‚Äôve always been ok being around them. I regularly make drinks with almond milk and I have no reaction so I assumed that would happen with the pecan drinks as well.
Unfortunately I had a severe reaction when I was making the drinks and I had to use my epi pen and go to the ER. The next time I went back to work I wore a mask and didn‚Äôt handle any of the pecan drinks, but the same thing happened and I had to use my epi pen and go to the ER.
When I filed a workers comp claim, the examiner I was assigned said that I would for sure be paid weekly until I go back to work at the end of December (when the pecan drink is off the menu) since I can‚Äôt work right now. However, for the last like two months everyone has been passing me around, I‚Äôve talked to nearly 2 dozen people who have just passed me to someone else, and no one has paid me.
Last Friday I spoke to someone who was actually helpful (finally) and she explained everything to me saying I was on a workers comp leave and because I‚Äôm on that type of leave I can‚Äôt be put on any other type of leave and again said I should 100% have been getting paid and should continue to be paid and she didn‚Äôt understand why it wasn‚Äôt happening, so she was going to call the examiner to get it sorted out.

When I look online, though, I‚Äôm still on a workers comp leave.
I was planning on quitting in the spring anyway after I finish my degree, but for right now I need a job. I have no idea what to do because for two months I waited because I was told to hang tight im going to be getting paid. Does anyone know if this seems shady or is this accurate?
