I know it’s confusing and painful.

I know the pain of looking at someone and not understanding why they’d break you.

I know you feel it in your chest, 
that tightness that makes it hard to breathe.

I know, 
I feel it too. 

But its an act of maturity when someone hurts you, 

And instead of reciprocating the pain,
You try to understand what they’ve been through. 

I looked at you with admiration,
But your eyes swayed to another.

I poured my heart,
and told you it hurt.

But you said it was innocent, 
they don’t matter. 

You kiss them as a joke,
You touch them for a laugh,
You call them beautiful,
just to feel a spark.

And when you’re done playing your games I’d be waiting for you,
with a broken heart.

But you couldn’t fix it,
You couldn’t fix something I no longer gave you access to.

I’d be waiting for you to see me.
Waiting for you to look at me and say I’m pretty too. 

You’d get angry,
Say I was overreacting.

That you meant nothing by it and you just had too much to drink.

So I took a step back, 
I was detaching.

No longer believing the words of affirmation you’d taught me to think.

I’d walk past mirrors with my head down, 
Avoiding reflections of myself.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
But the beholder beared the crown.

I placed you on a pedestal and your actions shaped my reality,

Imperfections and flaws was no longer in my head nor imaginary.

I lost sight of myself and what ‘I’ means,
Just to be the perfect version of me in your dreams. 

The line between love and imitation became a blur,

I hoped that you’d look at me the way you looked at her. 

But you couldn’t see me,
You were having too much fun.

I was drowning in thunder,
Whilst you were dancing beneath the sun. 

I’d ask you to stay, that I was hurting.
But you’d say sorry “my friends are waiting”. 

I’d say don’t drink, don’t do anything stupid. 
But that only made you see me as overbearing. 

You thought I was trying to change you,
That our worlds didn’t align.

But I didn’t set eyes on your freedom,
I was only just trying to keep you as mine. 

I lived in a delusion,
I thought maybe this is as good as it gets.

Maybe this is just how love is,
You forgive and forget.

Everyone said you were perfect,
So I thought I was the problem,
and expecting more would just cause pain and regret. 

We bought a house and played family.

Me, you and a cat, as good as it could be.
The sun would rise,
We’d have coffee.
You’d kiss me good morning.
We were happy. 

But it felt wrong,

Something didn’t feel right.

An ache in my bones that I was ignoring.
There was clear blue skies yet rain was pouring.

In a final act of desperation, 
I let you be.

Give yourself to who you want, 
Seek that spark, you can be free.

Because I’m leaving, 
One way or another.

It’s not who I am but with you its harder.

You said no, that it wasn’t right,
Not that you were jealous but because it hurt your pride. 

Then women came flooding in, 
And it was all fine.

Your ego was satisfied and you were not on the sideline.

You could bear to see me with another man, 
But you couldn’t tarnish your ego.

Your manhood hurt more than the body you let go. 

Then he came along,
You said be confident and strong,
Words of encouragement to send me to another man,
Was bizarre yet fit your plan. 

I followed pursuit,
If you could do it then why should I feel guilt?
You thought it would be one night and we’d be even. 

Then the nights turned into days,
And you’d be waiting for me every evening.

I’d come back with flowers and bliss,
A smile on my face.

My heart full of the love that you had erased. 

Once he filled me with confidence and liberation, 
I stopped seeking your words for validation.

Because he’d look at me like he’d seen the galaxy,

And that’s when I realised you never truly loved me.

You say people show love differently,
But surely not having eyes for another is a basic necessity? 

I couldn’t bear to be apart even for a single day, 
Yet you were the happiest when you were away.

You showered me with gifts instead of showing emotion,
And all this time I just wanted you to have some devotion.

You’d say you love me yet it wouldn’t reach your eyes,
He’d stay silent and his eyes would speak a thousand lines.

But none of it mattered because I wanted it all from you,
Yet you said you cannot love like that,
So there was nothing left for me to do.

Sure I could have stayed,
Let go of it all and settle with almost.

But people don’t change, 
After you’d thrown away all the chances I gave.

You chose to not fight for me and instead pushed me away,
In this cruel game of a relationship that we played.

I really hoped that you’d try, 
Tried to win me back and not say bye.

Because I so wanted to be wrong about my doubts and intuitions.
But at the end of it all you showed your true colours and confirmed my suspicions.

It is a shame you were going to propose,
It breaks my heart that marriage was something you never disclosed.

I’d make believe and envision weddings,
Look at rings and admire dresses.

You’d see and joke about the marriage life,
Yet never mentioned you wanted me to be your wife.

I know you find humour in life,
That laughing through pain is how you cope.

But with that we lost all sincerity,
Until everything became a one big joke. 

So I grieved you before you were even gone,
Mourning the corpse of a relationship that we wore.

And at the end of it all I had no tears left to shed.

Just a closed chapter and a rotting door.

Your Science-Backed Guide to Falling Asleep Fast,"**How to go to sleep fast?** We've all been there. You crawl into bed exhausted, ready to embrace blissful slumber... only to find your mind racing, your body restless, and the clock ticking relentlessly towards a groggy, frustrating tomorrow. The struggle to fall asleep quickly is real and incredibly common, impacting mood, productivity, and overall health. But the good news? Falling asleep faster isn't magic – it’s a science. Let's explore proven strategies to help you drift off swiftly and reclaim your nights.

# Understanding the Enemy: Why Can't You Fall Asleep?

Before diving into solutions, it helps to understand common culprits:

1.     **Stress and Anxiety:** The modern mind is often stuck in overdrive. Worries about work, relationships, or tomorrow's to-do list flood your system with cortisol (the stress hormone), directly opposing sleep hormones like melatonin.

2.     **Poor Sleep Hygiene:** Irregular sleep schedules, stimulating activities before bed (scrolling, intense TV), excessive caffeine/alcohol, and an uncomfortable sleep environment sabotage your body's natural wind-down process.

3.     **Light Exposure:** Blue light from phones, tablets, and computers tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime, suppressing melatonin production. Even ambient light in your bedroom can be disruptive.

4.     **Physical Discomfort:** An old mattress, wrong pillow, room too hot/cold, or even indigestion can make finding a comfortable position impossible.

5.     **Underlying Conditions:** Sometimes, chronic insomnia points to medical issues (sleep apnea, thyroid problems, chronic pain) or mental health conditions (depression, anxiety disorders). Consult a doctor if sleep problems persist.

# Your Toolkit for Faster Sleep Onset: Science-Backed Strategies

Conquering fast sleep onset requires a multi-pronged approach, often called ""sleep hygiene."" Consistency is key!

1.     **Master Your Circadian Rhythm:**

o   **Consistent Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, *even on weekends*. This trains your internal body clock.

o   **Harness Morning Light:** Get bright natural light exposure within 30-60 minutes of waking. This signals your brain that the day has started and helps set your melatonin release for later.

o   **Embrace Evening Darkness:** Dim lights 1-2 hours before bed. Use blackout curtains and minimize screen time. If you must use devices, enable ""night shift"" or use blue-light-blocking glasses.

2.     **Create a Sleep Sanctuary:**

o   **Optimize Environment:** Keep your bedroom cool (around 60-67°F or 15-19°C), dark, and quiet. Consider earplugs or a white noise machine if needed.

o   **Reserve the Bed:** Use your bed only for sleep and intimacy. Avoid working, eating, or watching TV in bed. This strengthens the mental association between bed and sleep.

o   **Comfort is King:** Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows suited to your sleep position. Choose breathable, comfortable bedding.

3.     **Perfect Your Wind-Down Routine (The 60-90 Minute Pre-Sleep Ritual):**

o   **Power Down Electronics:** Shut off phones, tablets, and laptops at least 60 minutes before bed. The mental stimulation and blue light are major sleep disruptors.

o   **Relaxing Activities:** Engage in calming activities: take a warm bath (the subsequent drop in body temperature aids sleep), read a physical book (non-stimulating content), practice gentle stretching or yoga, listen to soothing music or a sleep podcast, or try meditation.

o   **Mind Dump:** If worries keep you up, try journaling. Write down your thoughts, to-dos, or anxieties to get them out of your head and onto paper.

4.     **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques (For When You're Already in Bed):**

o   **Deep Breathing (4-7-8 Technique):** Inhale quietly through your nose for 4 seconds. Hold your breath for 7 seconds. Exhale forcefully through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat 3-4 times. This activates the parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest).

o   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):** Starting from your toes, tense a muscle group tightly for 5 seconds, then completely relax it for 20-30 seconds. Work your way up through your calves, thighs, abdomen, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and face. Focuses the mind and releases physical tension.

o   **Guided Imagery:** Visualize a peaceful, detailed scene – a quiet beach, a serene forest. Engage all your senses in the visualization.

o   **Body Scan:** Bring your attention slowly and non-judgmentally to each part of your body, noticing sensations without trying to change them, starting from your toes up to your head.

5.     **Lifestyle Tweaks:**

o   **Watch Your Intake:** Avoid caffeine (coffee, tea, soda, chocolate) for at least 6-8 hours before bed. Limit alcohol – while it might make you drowsy initially, it disrupts sleep quality later in the night. Avoid large, heavy meals close to bedtime (allow 2-3 hours). Stay hydrated, but reduce liquids 1-2 hours before sleep to minimize nighttime bathroom trips.

o   **Move Your Body:** Regular exercise significantly improves sleep quality. However, avoid vigorous workouts within 2-3 hours of bedtime, as they can be stimulating. Gentle yoga or stretching in the evening is beneficial.

o   **Manage Daytime Stress:** Incorporate stress-reduction techniques throughout your day (exercise, meditation, time in nature) to prevent it from accumulating and sabotaging your night.

# What If You Still Can't Sleep?

If you find yourself lying awake for more than 20-30 minutes, *get out of bed*. Go to another dimly lit room and do a quiet, relaxing activity (like reading a physical book) until you feel sleepy. Avoid screens! Then return to bed. This prevents associating your bed with frustration.

# Feeling Like You Tried Everything? Exploring Targeted Solutions

Even with perfect sleep hygiene, some nights (or phases of life) make falling asleep feel like an impossible battle. Persistent stress, hormonal shifts, or simply an overactive mind can require additional support. This is where targeted sleep aids *used responsibly* can be part of the solution.

[**>>> Sleep like a baby tonight (try this 30-second reset)!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepleanreview/comments/1m1wp26/yu_sleep_review_2025_does_yu_sleep_drops_really/)

Emerging solutions focus on quickly calming the nervous system to trigger the body's natural sleep response. One approach gaining significant attention involves simple, science-backed techniques designed for rapid relaxation – think of it as a ""reset button"" for your pre-sleep state, helping you transition from wired to tired almost instantly.

Waking up exhausted despite a full night in bed is often a sign of poor sleep *quality*, not just quantity. Factors like stress-induced shallow sleep, frequent micro-awakenings, or failing to reach deep restorative sleep stages leave you feeling unrefreshed. Addressing the *onset* of sleep with methods that promote deep, uninterrupted rest from the very beginning is crucial. Techniques that promote immediate relaxation can set the stage for higher-quality sleep throughout the night.

# The Takeaway: Be Patient and Persistent

Falling asleep fast is a skill that improves with consistent practice of good sleep hygiene. There's no instant, magical cure, but by understanding the science of sleep and implementing these evidence-based strategies, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to drift off. Create your routine, optimize your environment, manage stress, and be kind to yourself. Sweet dreams are within reach.

it's 0844PST and I'm still awake from a night off. 
I got a kick out of a recent post here asking if anyone has ever called out of Night Shifts for being too tired so I'm going to share some tips I've had to use along my career.

I happen to be a Nurse, working NOC shifts 8hours to 16hours long, 3 to 7 days a week.
 *I also happen to be someone who nearly lost their life, due to NOT taking care of myself while working night shift. I found out the hard way you can't live off of cigarettes, coffee, and Chevron snacks. I wound up in the Hospital for a nearly fatal gastrointestinal condition that required emergency surgery and a 3 months hospital stay. 
I highly don't recommend doing what I did*

This is what I do NOW: 
Follow a disciplined regimen
-Prioritizing Sleep (non negotiable)
-Hydration, Hygiene, House work, (non negotiable) Empty bladder and bowel regularly for adequate digestion for optimum energy.
-Charge devices, keep away from bed, set all the alarms.
-No skipping meals! I've lost weight by eating 3 balanced meals.
-Preparing as much as humanly possible on nights off for work week including meal prep (3 meals daily), plenty of scrubs, pajamas for after, skin care/getting ready stuff, work bag, gas in the vehicle etc.
-Ultimately reducing stress helps a ton to keep you going. 
-Also, send a text or call a friend or family member, maintain some social activity or connect via zoom. 

Ok, so anyways.
Here's how I've gotten OUT of being called-in to work.

1600(4pm) 
Ring ring: I ignore it.
Text text: Please respond as it is mandatory to respond yes or no for availability to work tonight's shift
I call them: ""Yes, Hi, I would love to help out  however I've just sat for dinner and I've had some wine already, sorry"" 🙃

Here's what I've used as an excuse to call-out of a shift: 

*While given ample time to solve staffing situation, I call 6 to 7 hours before a 12 hour shift starts. I call 4 to 5 hours before an 8 or 16 hour shift.*

""I'm so sorry, I won't be coming in tonight."" ( I tell them right away) "" I haven't slept well and there's no way I'm cognitively alert enough to manage my patients"" 

Or there's always :

""I have diarrhea, sorry"" 💩

Traverse City’s newest brewery – Nocturnal Bloom Brewing, located in the Atomic Marketplace at 3344 Cass Road – is planning a July 30 grand opening, with owner Justin Rivard using hyper-local ingredients and a botanical-inspired approach to put his own take on craft beer, cocktails, NA drinks, and more. *The Ticker* has the latest on the brewery launch, plus updates on a new Taco Bell location in Acme, the sale of Family Fare’s parent company, multiple new businesses opening locally, and other restaurant and retail news.

**Nocturnal Bloom Brewing**  
Residents accustomed to the industrial look of Cass Road’s commercial corridor near South Airport Road may have clocked an unusual change in the landscape recently: a sleek, modernistic, Scandinavian barn built near the driveway entrance to Sara Lee. That building is Atomic Marketplace (pictured), a new multi-tenant project housing the recently opened Seismoto Coffee Bar – operated by Jolie Roth with a variety of coffee, espresso, and fresh-baked pastry options daily from 7am to 4pm – and [Nocturnal Bloom Brewing](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/entertainment-centerrestaurant-proposed-at-gt-mall-taproomcafe-planned-for-cass-road/).

Owner Justin Rivard is pouring his passion for conservation, ecology, and biology – plus his experience at Great Lakes Malting Company – into the new brewery. Sourcing as many local and state ingredients as he can, from Michigan hops to King Orchards fruit, Rivard is planning an initial beer lineup that includes a black walnut brown ale, cherry wheat ale, Michigan hazy IPA, cream ale, German pilsner, pear Belgian, and ntiro coffee stout made in collaboration with Seismoto. Cider partnerships with Tandem Ciders and Left Foot Charley, wine from Black Star Farms, and plans for an expanded beverage rollout in the coming weeks with cocktails, seltzers, and low-ABV and NA drinks are also on deck.

“We have plans to make our own in-house vermouths and amaros, and at some point could produce some of our own spirits, like gin,” Rivard says. He hopes to offer both “recession-proof” easy-drinking beers and more experimental botanical concoctions – such as white pine-soaked vodka, bergamot lavender pale ale, and spicebush beer.

The brewery and coffee bar share an airy Japandi-inspired interior and sprawling outdoor beer garden with patio seating and a bocce court. Live music and other events are planned for the property. Gold Baby Biscuits is planning multiple pop-ups at the site, with a long-term food option in the works. Following the July 30 grand opening, Rivard anticipates being open seven days a week for the summer. “We’re excited to get integrated into the community,” he says.

**More openings, closings, and moves...**  
**Taco Bell** is planning a new Acme location at the northeast corner of US-31 and M-72. The franchise aims to go in across three parcels that include a former bank drive-thru building. The owner is still working through Acme Township approvals, including completing a traffic impact report (township officials want to ensure no vehicle stacking occurs outside the project boundaries). Once those issues are addressed, a public hearing will be scheduled. Taco Bell representatives estimated renovations will take four months and listed anticipated hours of operation as 10am-midnight (dining room) and 7am-2am (drive-thru).

SpartanNash, the parent company of **Family Fare**, has been sold to C&S Wholesale Grocers – the parent corporation of Piggly Wiggly. The $1.77 billion deal is expected to close later this year and will create “the necessary scale, efficiency, and purchasing power needed to enable independent retailers to compete more effectively with larger big box chains,” SpartanNash President and CEO Tony Sarsa said in a statement. There are two Family Fare locations in Traverse City, including on Eighth Street and at Chums Corner.

Several new businesses are opening locally. **Southern Charm Consignment Boutique** – a women’s consignment shop carrying clothing, accessories, and décor – recently opened at 107 South Brownson Avenue in Kingsley. **Masala Magic by Anita**, a popular Indian truck operated by Chef Anita Jogi at Townline Ciderworks, is opening a second brick-and-mortar location at 115 Ames Street in Elk Rapids. Jogi said this week that a soft opening is coming soon. In Traverse City, candy and treat store **Sweet Asylum** has opened in Building 50 at The Village at Grand Traverse Commons, while new barber shop **Underground Hare** has opened its doors at 502 East Front (Suite C) across from The Little Fleet.

On the other end of Front Street, **Modern Bird** is preparing to launch a private upstairs dining room. Owner Andy Elliott says the intimate space can accommodate up to 18 people for seated dinners and private events. The restaurant is accepting bookings now for August and beyond. The space will also host classes – such as cocktail and wine tutorials – in the future.

**Urban Oasis Salt Spa** has relocated from South West Bay Shore Drive to a new home at 3899 West Front Street (Suite 2). “Our brand-new spa space is designed to offer you an even more relaxing and rejuvenating experience,” the company posted online. “With room to grow and new opportunities to pamper you, we’re excited to introduce even more of the services you love — along with some fresh additions coming soon!”

The east side of **Logan’s Landing**  [has been listed for sale](https://www.realestateone.com/MI/Grand+Traverse/Traverse+City/2020-W-South-Airport-Road-Traverse-City-MI-49684/1935511-MITAAR) on South Airport Road for $1.35 million. The listing “presents a rare opportunity to own a versatile riverfront property in a prime location” offering “high visibility, ample parking, and endless potential for a variety of uses.” *The Ticker*  [previously covered](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/a-new-dawn-for-logans-landing/) the sale of the mall’s western half and the challenges and opportunities presented by the site, which has been grandfathered in as a nonconforming structure in Garfield Township.

Finally, *The Ticker* has updates on multiple projects featured in previous stories. Southern-inspired “meat-and-three” restaurant [**Frank’s 231**](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/restaurant-and-retail-news-js-hamburg-kingsley-hammered-heifer-franks-231-umai-eats-and-more/) at 1779 S Garfield Ave (Suite A), art studio and supply shop [**Surfaces**](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/workshop-brewing-ricos-cafe-for-sale-more-restaurant-retail-news/) at 309 West Front Street (Suite A), and  [**Cottage Inn Pizza**](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/nobo-mrkt-relaunching-with-new-name-concept-more-restaurantretail-news/) at 822 East Front Street are all now officially open. After [publicly going up for sale last year](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/workshop-brewing-ricos-cafe-for-sale-more-restaurant-retail-news/), **Rico’s Café and Pizzeria** now has a new owner: Knot Just a Bar owner David Waskiewicz.

The **Hammered Heifer** – [which was planned to launch this summer on Honor Highway](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/restaurant-and-retail-news-js-hamburg-kingsley-hammered-heifer-franks-231-umai-eats-and-more/) – has been put on hold, with proprietor Mogen McCallister posting that he’s “taking the reins at the Hofbrau for the foreseeable future, and that’s going to take up all of my working time.” McCallister said he’d be dialing in new “Heifer-esque dishes” at Hofbrau until the “time is right” to launch the new restaurant.

Downtown, *Top Chef* veteran Sarah Welch and partner Cameron Rolka recently announced they have finalized [the purchase of 430 East Front Street](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/after-top-chef-and-two-acclaimed-restaurants-detroit-chefs-eye-next-adventure-traverse-city/) for their planned new oyster bar and restaurant called **Umbo** opening in 2026. The duo started building renovations this week. Meanwhile, Vicki Biddinger and Heidi Hallett – partners at **Pure Essence Salon**, which formerly occupied 430 East Front Street – have relocated the salon to 901B West Front Street and are open now next to Loco Boys Brewing Company.",1,1752767910.0,traversecity,1,1.0,False

The **Cuisinart DGB-2 Single Serve Coffee Maker** came into my kitchen looking like it deserved a spot on a magazine cover. With its sleek black matte finish, it fits snugly on my counter without taking up too much room, which is a relief considering how compact apartment kitchens can be. Measuring at just over 12 inches tall, it slides effortlessly under most cabinets. Unboxing it was straightforward, and the included components — the HomeBarista reusable filter cup and charcoal filter — were neatly packed. With no tools or extra steps required, setting it up took me under ten minutes. Everything about its design screams convenience, from the removable water reservoir to the clear buttons on its user-friendly interface.

This coffee maker definitely doesn’t mess around when it comes to brewing options. It offers three cup sizes: 8 ounces, 10 ounces, and 12 ounces. Testing all three, the 8-ounce brew worked well when I wanted a quick, strong cup, while the 12-ounce setting was perfect for leisurely sipping on weekends. You can use single-serve pods, but I mostly relied on the HomeBarista reusable filter cup. Having freshly ground beans brewed directly into my cup felt almost indulgent. The in-built conical burr grinder added an extra layer of freshness to the whole brewing process, sending the aroma of coffee beans wafting through my kitchen every morning.

**Superior Features Worth Highlighting**  
One of the winning points here is the grind-and-brew feature. I’ve had other coffee makers that grind beans, but none were integrated quite like this. Within seconds of pressing the button, the beans are ground with precision inside the hopper, which can store up to 100 grams. Bonus: the sealed lid helps keep the beans fresh! The HomeBarista filter feels sturdy, and the reusable design means less waste — big perk for the eco-conscious crowd. The water window is another small yet thoughtful addition. It lets me see exactly how much water is in the 48-ounce reservoir, which is removable for painless refilling and cleaning.  

**Powering Through Morning Routines**  
This machine has genuinely streamlined my chaotic mornings. With its programmable nature, I could set everything up the night before, and with one button press, my coffee was ready before I even had to fully wake up. Who doesn’t love avoiding complex settings pre-coffee? Although simple to operate, I did try out all the customization options, including skipping the grinder for pre-ground beans. This flexibility might be its best feature, letting my whole household (spouse, relatives, and a picky roommate included) use it the way they want.

**Pluses**  
- The reusable filter is environmentally friendly and works seamlessly with both ground beans and coffee pods.  
- Integrated grinder ensures every cup tastes fresh and rich in flavor.  
- Clear water window and removable reservoir simplify maintenance.  
- Compact design perfectly suits smaller spaces without compromising style.  

**Pitfalls**  
- A rather common issue I noticed was that the grinder can be a tad noisy for early mornings.  
- Not suitable for brewing multiple cups efficiently; it's entirely dedicated to single servings.  
- Lacked a warming plate, so the brewed coffee temperature didn’t stay hot for too long.  
- Pod compatibility is great, but some branded pods don’t fit perfectly, requiring adjustments.  

**Competitive Options**  
One coffee maker that came close during my research and comparisons is the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker. While the Keurig is known for its vast pod compatibility and quiet operation, it doesn’t offer the integrated grinder that the Cuisinart boasts. Freshly ground coffee is something no pre-packaged pod can quite replicate. On the other hand, if you’re someone who prioritizes speed and silent performance, the Keurig edges out in those aspects. Another contender, the Breville Bambino Plus, excels in espresso-style brewing and frothy milk for lattes, but it veers into a very specialized (and pricey) territory not everyone needs. The Cuisinart DGB-2 strikes that sweet balance of affordability, functionality, and design, which makes it a strong candidate for homes and smaller kitchens.

**Value for Money**  
This coffee maker proves its worth through features and versatility. While it's priced reasonably, given all that it offers, it does feel like an investment targeted at those who appreciate fresh-ground coffee but don’t want a full-scale espresso setup. Combine that with its durable build and ease of maintenance, and it’s easy to argue that it offers excellent quality for its price. The reusable filter and conical burr grinder alone save money in the long run because you’d spend a lot more on disposable pods or separate grinding equipment otherwise.

Lighting up a cigg literally became like a muscle memory, like the second I felt anything uncomfortable, I was outside with a cigarette before I even realized what I was doing. Like it just become a habit after a while, starting with all of us peers smoking together in college to now me smoking even alone at times.

It wasn’t even about the nicotine after a point. It was about escaping. About avoiding the slightest swirl of anxiety or whatever was bubbling under the surface. The smoke break felt like a breather from life, but looking back… I wasn’t breathing at all. I was just looking for ways too sabotage and find a reason to smoke. That 5 minute felt nice, but after that i was back in the loop of spiralling.

I’m a few weeks clean now (not my first try, but this one’s feeling different, I really hope it stays this time eh), and here’s the weirdest part now when I get overwhelmed… I just sit with it or sometimes even an iced coffee does the same for me, i try to compensate the smoke with maybe a good food item or iced coffee, ik it sounds weird but smh works for me. ome days i just ignore and let go off that urge, that 5 minutes of urge. No lighter Just me sitting with my damn feeling.I am still trying It’s not glamorous and sometimes it sucks. But it’s also kind of liberating? Like I’m finally dealing instead of dodging.

1m2b8dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m2b8dx/does_the_technivorm_moccamaster_kbgv_select_brew/,Does the Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select Brew the Perfect Cup?,"The Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 caught my eye as soon as I opened the box. I’d heard whispers about it being the go-to drip coffee machine for enthusiasts, and after a couple of weeks using it daily, I can confidently say those whispers weren’t far off. Now, I’m not a professional barista — just your average caffeine addict — but this coffee maker quickly turned me into one of those people who refuse to settle for mediocre mornings.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The build quality is unmistakably premium, which, quite frankly, you'd expect at this price point. The bold yet elegant Juniper color looks fantastic on my kitchen counter, giving off a retro-modern vibe. It’s a solid piece of equipment with a durable frame that feels like it could outlive most kitchen appliances. Measuring 6.5 x 12.75 x 14 inches, it fits snugly in smaller spaces while still accommodating its generously-sized 10-cup carafe. The glass carafe itself feels sturdy but not too heavy to manage, even when full. One thing I appreciated — and my sleep-fumbling hands surely noted — was how intuitive the button layout and operation were.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Consistently produces rich, golden-standard coffee.  
- Comes with a dedicated selector for brewing half or full carafes.  
- The hotplate's independent heating system keeps coffee warm for hours without burning it.  

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker doesn’t demand an advanced engineering degree to operate. With one simple button and a brew-volume selector switch, the interface is as straightforward as they come. It can brew a full 40-ounce pot in roughly 4 to 6 minutes, sparing me from standing around impatiently on groggy mornings. The automatic flow stopper feature also adds convenience; you can steal a cup mid-brew without making a mess.  

Check [Technivorm Moccamaster 53923](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0bpjqs63w/) price on Amazon.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
Coffee aficionados always talk about “the golden cup standard,” and this machine nails it. Every cup comes out at the perfect temperature, thanks to its pump-free design that heats water just right for optimal extraction. I tested it with several different coffee beans, from bold roasts to mild blends, and each brew captured a depth of flavor I hadn’t experienced with more basic coffee makers. It's also worth noting how quietly it operates — practically whispering as it works, ensuring I don’t wake up the entire household.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Brew basket occasionally drips after removing the carafe.  
- The machine’s warm-up period could feel a tad slow for those always in a rush.  

**Safety Features**  
Having that automatic shut-off feature after 100 minutes is genuinely reassuring. I’ll admit, I often forget to turn things off after rushing out of the door, so knowing this coffee maker won’t be sitting there all day brewing the air is a relief. Also, its independent heating element keeps the coffee warm without scorching it, making it safer than other models I’ve used where the carafe almost fries itself.  

**Competing Brands**  
While my experience with the Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 was stellar, there are other options worth discussing. Take the popular Breville Bambino Plus — it's not a drip coffee maker but an espresso machine with its own fans. Compared to the Moccamaster, it’s better for lovers of stronger, customizable coffee but doesn’t match its simplicity or capacity. Cuisinart’s DCC-3200 also comes to mind; it’s cheaper and offers programmable features but lacks the same consistent, pro-level brew quality. If reliability and design are priorities, the Moccamaster still stands out in the crowd.

**Price Performance**  
This isn’t a budget coffee maker, and honestly, no one should walk into a Technivorm purchase expecting a bargain. But considering its consistent brew quality, durability, and features like the half-carafe brewing option, it delivers excellent value in the long run. Sure, it’s an upfront investment, but the joy of getting café-quality coffee at home might just make it worth every penny.

A bad roast or origin or stale coffee, none of that gets fixed just because your espresso machine costs more than your rent. So if you think you will invest in a great machine and put crap into it, it’s not alchemy! You’re not transforming garbage into gold.

On the contrary there is a better chance that if you have good beans and decent tools then with your own craft and ability you can get good cup. Maybe not world class. But still good. Still satisfying. Still honest. Stop obsessing over expensive European tools. They are great but still not any consolation for bad beans. They won’t mask mediocrity.

I've been hunting for a good offer on a second hand machine around my area. Last week I stumbled upon a used GCP from 2022 for a decent price. Previous owner already upgraded to a 9bar OPV and included some extra goodies in the offer (nice tamper, distribution tool, knock bucket and extra silicone gasktes).
The machine looked quite nice and well kept! The grouphead needed cleaning, but the rest was in perfect condition.
I ran a desacaling procedure on it and upgraded to the IMS shower screen and basket.

Also grabbed the J-Ultra for the prime day discount! I'm not a fan of electrical grinders since I just don't want another big appliance that has only one use in my kitchen :)
I also enjoy the manual grinding process so I just decided to get a premium espresso hand grinder.

It's a common question, and I've done some digging to find out the answer.

The short answer is: it depends on your kettle. Most standard electric kettles are designed solely for boiling water, not for brewing beverages directly inside them. However, there are some specialized kettles that can handle more than just water.

Let's break it down:

Regular Electric Kettles:
These are meant for boiling water only. They're great for heating water quickly, which you then pour over your coffee grounds or tea bags in a separate container. Trying to brew directly in these could damage the kettle, affect the taste of your drink, and be hard to clean.

Specialized Kettles:
Some electric kettles come with built-in infusers or brewing baskets. These are designed to let you make tea directly in the kettle. They often have temperature controls too, which is perfect for different types of tea.

Coffee-Specific Electric Kettles:
There are even some kettles made specifically for brewing coffee. These usually have a pour-over design or a French press attachment.

Why You Shouldn't Use a Regular Kettle for Brewing:

1. Taste: The kettle's materials might affect the flavor of your drink.
2. Cleaning: Coffee and tea can leave residues that are hard to remove.
3. Functionality: Many kettles have elements that shouldn't come into direct contact with anything but water.
4. Safety: Some kettles might not be food-safe beyond boiling water.

If you're looking to streamline your coffee or tea making process, consider investing in a kettle designed for brewing. I recently found a great selection of electric kettles, including some with brewing capabilities, at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They've got options for all kinds of brewing needs.

In conclusion, while it's tempting to try and use your electric kettle as a one-stop shop for your morning brew, it's best to stick to its intended purpose unless you have a specialized model. The right tool for the job makes all the difference in getting that perfect cup of coffee or tea to start your day.

Remember, a good kettle is an investment in your daily comfort. Whether you're a tea enthusiast or a coffee lover, having the right equipment can make your brewing experience much more enjoyable. Happy brewing!",1,1752766946.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Brew Rite coffee filters boast several noteworthy features that contribute to their effectiveness and ease of use.

**Material and Construction:** Brew Rite coffee filters are typically made from high-quality paper pulp, frequently enough sourced from sustainable forests. This material is carefully processed to create a filter that is both strong and porous. The filters are designed to withstand the hot water and pressure involved in the brewing process without tearing or breaking, ensuring a consistent flow of coffee. The paper is also treated to minimize any paper taste that could affect the coffeeS flavor.

Paper quality is notable as it directly impacts the flavor and purity of the brewed coffee. Brew Rite uses a specific grade of paper that allows coffee oils and flavors to pass through while trapping undesirable particles. This attention to material composition ensures a clean and enjoyable cup of coffee every time.

**Shape and Size Options:** Brew Rite offers a range of filter shapes and sizes to accommodate different coffee makers. The most common shape is conical, designed for pour-over brewers and certain drip coffee makers, while basket-shaped filters are typically used in standard automatic drip machines. Sizes are typically measured in inches or by the number of cups the filter is designed to brew (e.g., 4-cup, 8-12 cup).

Having various sizes available ensures that you can find the perfect fit for your specific coffee maker, preventing overflow or under-extraction. Accurate sizing is critically important for optimal brewing, allowing the water to saturate the coffee grounds evenly and extract the maximum flavor.

**Filter Thickness and Density:** The thickness and density of the Brew Rite coffee filters are carefully controlled to provide optimal filtration. A thicker filter will generally trap more sediment, resulting in a cleaner cup of coffee, while a less dense filter may allow for a faster flow rate. Brew Rite strikes a balance to provide a good filtration level without excessively slowing down the brewing process.

The density of the paper influences the extraction rate and the clarity of the final brew. Brew Rite filters are designed to allow the right amount of oils and flavors to pass through for a rich and satisfying cup.

**Environmental Considerations:** Many Brew Rite coffee filters are manufactured with sustainability in mind. They are often made from recycled paper or are biodegradable, allowing for responsible disposal after use. This is an important feature for environmentally conscious consumers who want to minimize their impact.

Choosing filters made from sustainable materials is a small but meaningful way to reduce waste and support environmentally friendly practices. Brew Rite's commitment to sustainability makes their filters a responsible choice for coffee lovers.

Key features of Brew Rite coffee filters include:

* High-quality paper construction
* Variety of shapes and sizes
* Controlled thickness and density
* Environmentally conscious options

## core Benefits

Brew Rite coffee filters provide several practical benefits that enhance the coffee brewing experience.

**Improved Coffee Clarity:** One of the primary benefits of using Brew Rite filters is the improved clarity of the coffee. The filters effectively trap coffee grounds and sediment, preventing them from ending up in your cup. This results in a smoother, cleaner-tasting coffee with no gritty residue.

Many users have reported a noticeable difference in coffee clarity when switching to Brew Rite filters. This enhancement translates to a more enjoyable coffee drinking experience, especially for those who are sensitive to sediment.

**Consistent Brewing:** Brew Rite filters are designed to maintain a consistent flow rate during the brewing process. this ensures that the water saturates the coffee grounds evenly, resulting in a more balanced extraction. consistent brewing leads to a more predictable and repeatable coffee flavor profile.

Consistency in brewing is crucial for achieving the same great taste every time.Brew Rite filters help eliminate variables that can affect the brewing process, such as uneven water flow or grounds escaping into the brew.

**Ease of Use:** Brew Rite coffee filters are incredibly easy to use. Simply place the filter in the coffee maker's filter basket, add the desired amount of ground coffee, and start the brewing cycle. The filters are designed to fit snugly in the basket and stay in place during brewing, preventing any messes or spills.

Their ease of use makes them a convenient choice for both experienced and novice coffee brewers. The simple process of using these filters streamlines the brewing process, allowing you to enjoy your coffee without any hassle.

## FAQs Section

**are Brew Rite coffee filters bleached?**
Brew Rite offers both bleached and unbleached coffee filters. bleached filters undergo a process to whiten the paper, while unbleached filters retain their natural brown color. Both types of filters are safe to use,but some users prefer unbleached filters to avoid any potential taste from the bleaching process.

**How do I choose the correct size Brew Rite filter for my coffee maker?**
To choose the correct size Brew Rite filter, refer to your coffee maker's instruction manual or the filter basket's specifications. Common sizes correspond to the number of cups the coffee maker is designed to brew (e.g., 4-cup, 8-12 cup). Measure the diameter of the filter basket or compare the shape to the filter shapes offered by Brew Rite (cone or basket) as well.

**Can I reuse Brew Rite coffee filters?**
While it's technically possible to reuse paper coffee filters, it's generally not recommended. Reusing filters can lead to a buildup of coffee oils and sediment, which can affect the taste and clarity of future brews. additionally, the filter's structural integrity may be compromised after the first use, leading to tearing or grounds escaping into the coffee.

1. Did vyvanse have positive effects for you the first time you took it, or did you have to build it up in your system? Did you notice any positive effect AT ALL the first day? 
2. What negative side effects has vyvanse given you? Has anyone else had to stop taking it, and what did you do? 
3. Does your provider say you have to take it every single day, or is it ""as needed"" or what's the schedule you all have been given? 

Long story: 

I was overjoyed to finally get an ADHD diagnosis (after much peer review) and started medication last Tuesday. My prescriber listed off some side effects including headache but said they'd be mild and that she expected me to have positive results the very first day. She did warn me to make sure I eat and stay hydrated. I'm on generic Vyvanse 20mg. 

No *positive* results the first day. I kind of felt like I'd had too much coffee; I told a friend I felt like I was strapped to the front of a rollercoaster and just kind of clinging on. I did eat a big breakfast, I drank 2 Brita pitchers of water throughout the day and used 2 servings of electrolyte powder. I put a whole scoop of protein powder in my oatmeal. I wasn't particularly hungry throughout the day but not food adverse and ate a full lunch and dinner. I had a bit of a headache and I think my ADHD symptoms were actually worse; I was clumsier, I forgot to give my dog her medication (I've NEVER done that and she's OK now but it sucked to see them still in her pill calendar hours late), I locked myself out of my home for the first time this year. I started trying to work on some of the MOUNTAIN of tasks I have to do but couldn't stay on task. But I did write some super long Reddit posts (I kept thinking ""I need to get off Reddit"" and then I'd click something else). That night I got palpitations and couldn't sleep, tossing and turning until 2:30 or 3am and then having to get up at 6, so only 3 hours. 

I contacted my prescriber and she said to keep it up and changed her tune, saying no benefits the first day is normal and all the symptoms are normal. She did not respond when I asked how long the symptoms would last and when I'd see positive results. I took the pill a little earlier (7am) day 2 with another full serving of oatmeal + protein powder, chugged water, had some cereal an hour later just to really have food in my stomach. Headache throughout the day but nothing too terrible. Still no positive effects. Needed one particular thing, went to the store, stared at food that didn't feel edible so I left without buying anything, including that one stupid thing I needed because I forgot about it. I was too tired and embarrassed to go back. Got a little bit of work done but less than on a normal non-medicated day. Ate a normal lunch and dinner, chugged water, electrolytes. 

Last night was fucking terrible. I don't think I've ever had a headache this bad in my life. It was in my left eye and took over the front of my head, shooting into my neck. Started around 6/7pm and lasted ALL NIGHT, so that's another night with no sleep. My heart was fluttering, light hurt, I had some flashes of light, couldn't look at my phone or computer, nauseous, eyes hard to focus, just crying and miserable. It's not as bad but I can still feel it waiting behind my eye and my neck and shoulders feel wrecked. I've got most lights turned off in my home with curtains drawn and the brightness is turned way down on my computer, which is in dark mode. I have an important Zoom meeting later and I don't know what to do because I look like complete shit and everything hurts. I have bruises on my face from pressing and hitting myself trying to disrupt the pain and my skin is all red from ice and heat packs. My teeth hurt. I don't really drink but this might be what a hangover feels like. I looked up migraines and I really think I might have had a migraine or cluster headache. Like if I didn't live alone I would have asked someone to take me to the ER, it was so bad. The one difference is I remembered to take my multivitamin the first day and I didn't the second day but I don't know why that would make a difference. Of course on the second day I was going on 3 hrs of sleep and now today I've just had some fitful sleep IDK how many hours total. 

I didn't take the pill today. I notified my provider that this isn't working for me and I need a few days to recover and then would like to try something else. She hasn't responded yet but I'm worried I'll be labelled as noncompliant or she won't let me try a different med or she'll be upset because she previously insisted I needed to take it every day for 2 weeks. But I can't deal with that kind of pain and no sleep for 2 weeks; I have to work and take care of my dog and I have a ton of shit piled up that I need to get done. I can't live like this.

1m2aso9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1m2aso9/im_a_smalltime_youtuber_whol_makes_rulesbsed/,Im a smalltime youtuber whol makes rulesbsed creepypasta.,"I was halfway through smashing every mirror in my dead grandfather's cabin when I realized the reflections weren't breaking with the glass. They just stood there, grinning at me with faces that weren't mine, watching me destroy their prison one shard at a time. That's when I heard my little sister's voice. Calling my name from inside the shattered remains of the bathroom mirror, even though I'd buried her five years ago.

Let me back up for a second because none of this makes sense without knowing how I ended up trapped in this frozen nightmare. My name's Marcus, I'm a construction worker from Phoenix, and three weeks ago my life was falling apart faster than a house built on sand. Lost my job, girlfriend left me, dad died of cancer, and I was two months behind on rent. Then I got a call from some lawyer in Montana telling me my grandfather had died and left me his cabin in the middle of nowhere. I'd never even met the old man. My dad always said he was crazy, lived like a hermit up in the mountains, but desperate times and all that.

So I packed everything I owned into my beat-up Chevy and drove north into what felt like the end of the world. The cabin sat in a valley surrounded by pine trees so thick they blocked out half the sky. Snow covered everything like a burial shroud, three feet deep and still falling. The isolation hit me immediately. No cell service, no neighbors for miles, just endless white silence that seemed to press against my skull. The cabin itself looked solid enough, dark logs and a stone chimney, but something about it felt wrong from the moment I stepped out of my truck.

The front door was already unlocked. Inside, the place was clean but strange. Everything looked normal at first glance, leather furniture, stone fireplace, mounted deer heads staring down with glassy eyes. But then I noticed what wasn't there. No mirrors. Not a single one anywhere. The bathroom had a bare wall over the sink with screw holes where a medicine cabinet should have been. Picture frames hung empty or had been removed entirely, leaving ghostly outlines on the wood-paneled walls. It was like someone had systematically stripped away anything that could show a reflection.

All except one. In the bedroom, a full-length mirror stood against the back of the door, tall and spotless. When I caught sight of myself in it, I looked pale and exhausted from the drive. Just a guy in an empty room, nothing more. But I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me from inside that glass.

That first night, I built a fire and tried to relax. The wind howled through the pines like something dying, and snow kept tapping against the windows in tiny, insistent fingers. I was heating up a can of soup when I found the envelope on the kitchen counter. My name was written on it in shaky handwriting. Inside was a single sheet of paper with five rules written in my grandfather's careful script:

Rule 1: Never look into any reflective surface after dark. Rule 2: Keep every light in the cabin burning from sunset to sunrise. Rule 3: If you hear voices calling your name, do not answer. Rule 4: Never let tears fall onto glass or metal. Rule 5: If they start moving on their own, run.

At the bottom, in different ink like it had been added later, was a sixth line: ""They're already here. They've been waiting.""

I laughed out loud, the sound echoing strangely in the empty cabin. My grandfather really had been crazy, just like dad said. These rules read like something from a bad horror movie. But as I crumpled up the paper, I noticed my reflection in the dark kitchen window. For just a split second, it looked like it was staring back at me instead of mimicking my movements. I froze, heart hammering, but when I looked again it was perfectly normal.

The scratching started around midnight. Soft at first, like mice in the walls, but then it got louder and more deliberate. Scrape, scrape, scrape from somewhere inside the cabin. I grabbed a flashlight and searched every room, but I couldn't find the source. The sound seemed to follow me, always coming from whatever room I wasn't in. When I finally gave up and went to bed, it stopped completely.

I was drifting off when I heard it. A voice, faint and distant, calling through the wind. ""Marcus? Marcus, are you there?"" It sounded like my sister Emma, but that was impossible. Emma had died in a car accident five years ago. I'd been driving that night. I'd been drinking. The voice came again, clearer this time, and it was definitely her. ""Marcus, I'm so cold. Why won't you let me in?""

Rule three echoed in my head. If you hear voices calling your name, do not answer. I pulled the blanket over my head and tried to ignore it, but Emma kept calling. Her voice got more desperate, more pleading. ""Please, Marcus. I'm sorry about the fight we had. I forgive you. Just open the door.""

The fight. She was talking about our last conversation before the accident, when she'd screamed at me for being a drunk and a failure. I'd stormed out of the house in a rage, and she'd followed me. If I hadn't been so angry, if I hadn't gotten behind the wheel that night, she'd still be alive. The guilt was like a knife twisting in my chest, but I forced myself to stay quiet.

The voice stopped just before dawn, and I finally fell into an exhausted sleep.

I woke up to find frost covering the inside of every window, even though the fire had been burning all night. The cabin was freezing, and my breath came out in visible puffs. When I went to check the thermostat, I saw something that made my blood turn to ice. Handprints were pressed into the frost on the living room window. Small handprints, like a child's, all over the glass from the inside.

Emma's handprints.

I stumbled backward and knocked over a lamp. As it hit the floor, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the broken pieces. But it wasn't my reflection. It was Emma, pale and waterlogged like she'd looked in the morgue, pressing her hands against the glass and mouthing my name. I blinked and it was gone, just scattered shards showing fragments of my terrified face.

That's when I found the journal hidden under a loose floorboard near the fireplace. My grandfather's journal, filled with entries dating back fifteen years. The first entry was dated just a few months after my grandmother had died:

""October 15th. Eleanor appeared to me today while I was shaving. Not a memory or a hallucination. She was standing behind me in the mirror, wearing her wedding dress. She looked exactly as she did on our wedding day, but her eyes were wrong. Empty. When she spoke, her voice had no echo, no warmth. 'John,' she said, 'it's so beautiful here. So peaceful. You should join me.' I dropped the mirror and it shattered, but for a moment before it broke, her reflection didn't break with it. It just folded in on itself and vanished.""

I flipped through more entries, my hands shaking. Page after page of encounters with dead relatives, friends, loved ones appearing in reflective surfaces. Always trying to lure him somewhere, always promising peace or forgiveness or love. And always getting more aggressive when he refused.

One entry near the middle caught my attention: ""They're not really them. I understand that now. They're something else wearing the faces of our grief, feeding on our guilt and longing. They can only exist in reflections, but they're learning. Getting stronger. Last night I saw my father's reflection move independently of me for almost thirty seconds. God help me, I almost answered when he called my name.""

The final entry was written in a shaky hand: ""They've broken through. No longer confined to mirrors. Sarah Williams from town went missing last week. Her husband said she kept talking to her dead daughter's reflection in their bathroom mirror. Then one morning she was just gone. They're taking people now. The rules are all that keep them at bay. If anyone finds this, follow the rules. Never trust the reflections.""

I slammed the journal shut and looked around the cabin with new eyes. Every dark window was a potential doorway. Every piece of metal or glass was a gateway for these things to watch me, to learn about me, to wear the faces of everyone I'd ever lost.

The sun was setting, and I suddenly understood why rule two was so important. I ran around the cabin turning on every light I could find. Lamps, overhead fixtures, even the light inside the refrigerator. Anything to push back the darkness where reflections became deeper, more real.

But I missed one. The chrome surface of the coffee pot in the kitchen. As I walked past it, I saw movement in its curved surface. Emma was there, clearer than before, pressing her hands against the metal from the inside. Her mouth was moving, forming words I couldn't hear. Then she smiled, and it wasn't Emma's smile at all. It was something hungry and patient and utterly alien.

I grabbed the coffee pot and hurled it into the fireplace. The metal cracked and warped in the flames, and for a moment I heard a sound like screaming wind. But the screaming wasn't coming from the fire. It was coming from every reflective surface in the cabin.

The windows began to rattle in their frames. The silverware in the kitchen drawer started clinking together like wind chimes. And then Emma's voice came from everywhere at once, no longer pleading but commanding. ""Marcus. Look at me. You owe me that much.""

I pressed my hands over my ears, but the voice was inside my head now. ""You killed me, Marcus. The least you can do is look at me.""

The guilt was overwhelming. She was right. I did owe her that much. I had killed her. If I just looked, just talked to her, maybe I could finally apologize. Maybe I could make things right.

I took a step toward the dark kitchen window where her voice seemed strongest. The glass was fogged with condensation, but I could see a shape forming in the moisture. Emma's face, becoming clearer with each passing second.

""That's it,"" she whispered. ""Come closer. I forgive you, Marcus. I forgive everything.""

I was inches from the glass when I remembered rule four. Never let tears fall onto glass or metal. I was crying. Had been crying since I heard her voice. And my tears were about to hit the window.

I jerked backward just as the first tear fell. It struck the glass with a sound like a bell, and the window exploded inward. But instead of shards of glass, something else came through. A hand, pale and waterlogged, reaching for my face. Behind it, more hands, dozens of them, all pressing through the broken window from some impossible space beyond.

I ran. Grabbed my grandfather's journal and my truck keys and ran for the door. But as I reached for the handle, I caught sight of my reflection in the chrome doorknob. And it wasn't alone. Emma was standing right behind me, close enough to touch, her eyes black holes in her pale face.

""You can't leave,"" she said, and her voice came from behind me and inside the doorknob at the same time. ""We won't let you.""

I yanked my hand back and looked over my shoulder. Nothing there. But in every piece of metal, every dark window, every glossy surface, faces were appearing. Not just Emma now, but others. My father, looking exactly as he had in the hospital bed. My grandmother, who'd died when I was twelve. Strangers I didn't recognize but who seemed to know me, all pressing against their glass and metal prisons, all reaching toward me with desperate hands.

The truck. I had to get to the truck. I grabbed a kitchen towel and wrapped it around the door handle so I wouldn't see my reflection, then ran out into the snow. The cold hit me like a physical blow, but I didn't stop. My truck was parked twenty feet away, and those twenty feet felt like twenty miles.

Behind me, the cabin's windows were blazing with impossible light. Not the warm glow of electric bulbs, but something cold and hungry. In every window, silhouettes moved and gestured, calling my name in a chorus of familiar voices.

I reached the truck and fumbled for my keys. But when I looked at the driver's side mirror to back out, Emma was there. Not a reflection this time. She was sitting in the passenger seat, solid and real and dripping wet despite the freezing air.

""You're not leaving me again,"" she said, and when she smiled, I saw that her teeth were broken glass.

I screamed and threw myself out of the truck. She was gone when I looked back, but the passenger seat was soaked through. The smell of lake water and decay filled the cab. I couldn't drive like this. Couldn't risk looking in any of the mirrors. And walking through the forest in a blizzard was suicide.

I was trapped. Just like my grandfather had been trapped. Just like everyone who'd ever inherited this place had been trapped.

That's when I remembered the basement. The journal had mentioned a workshop down there, a place where my grandfather had tried to understand what these things were. If there were answers anywhere, they'd be down there.

I found the trapdoor under the living room rug. The basement was small and cramped, lit by a single bare bulb. The walls were covered with research, newspaper clippings about missing people, scientific papers about the physics of light and reflection. And in the center of the room was a workbench covered with modified cameras and strange devices I didn't recognize.

But what caught my attention was the wall behind the workbench. It was covered with broken mirrors, hundreds of pieces of different sizes, all carefully arranged in a massive mosaic. And in each piece, movement. Faces appearing and disappearing, hands pressing against the glass, mouths opening and closing in silent screams.

A tape recorder sat on the workbench. The tape inside was labeled ""Final Experiment."" I hit play with shaking fingers.

My grandfather's voice crackled through the speakers: ""They're not from our world. They exist in the spaces between light and reflection, feeding on our memories of the dead. Each mirror, each reflective surface, is a window into their realm. And they've learned to use our grief as a bridge.""

The tape hissed for a moment before continuing: ""I've spent fifteen years studying them. They can't fully manifest in our world, not without help. They need us to invite them in, to willingly look into their realm and give them permission to cross over. That's why they use the faces of our dead. Who wouldn't want to see a lost loved one again?""

I glanced at the mosaic wall. The faces were more active now, all turned toward me. Emma was there, and my father, and dozens of others. All beckoning, all pleading, all promising peace if I'd just come closer.

""But I found something else,"" my grandfather's voice continued. ""They're not invincible. They're parasites, dependent on reflection to exist. Cut off their connection to our world, and they starve. The cabin sits on a convergence point, a place where their realm and ours are closest. That's why they're strongest here. But it's also why destroying the convergence might banish them permanently.""

The tape ended with a sound like breaking glass, and I realized what my grandfather had been planning. He'd wanted to destroy the cabin, to shatter the connection between worlds. But something had stopped him. Or someone.

I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me. Slow, deliberate steps that squelched with each footfall. I turned around and saw Emma descending into the basement. But not the Emma from the mirrors. This was the Emma from the night she died, broken and bleeding, her neck twisted at an impossible angle.

""I've been waiting so long,"" she said, her voice a wet whisper. ""Do you know how cold it is on the other side? How lonely?""

Behind her, more figures appeared. My father, pale and wasted from the cancer. My grandmother, her face serene but her eyes empty holes. And others, strangers whose grief had fed these things, all crowding down the narrow stairs.

""We just want to be together again,"" Emma said, taking another step closer. ""One happy family. Forever and ever.""

I backed against the mosaic wall and felt the cold touch of glass against my skin. The broken mirrors were trembling, vibrating with some horrible energy. And I realized this wasn't a wall at all. It was a doorway. A massive portal into their realm, held closed by nothing more than my grandfather's will and the rules he'd written.

""All you have to do is look,"" Emma whispered. She was right in front of me now, close enough that I could smell the lake water in her hair. ""Look into the mirrors, Marcus. See how beautiful it is on our side. See how peaceful.""

I was crying again, tears streaming down my face. The grief was overwhelming, five years of guilt and regret and self-hatred all crushing down on me at once. It would be so easy to just look, to just let them take me. To finally pay for what I'd done.

But then I remembered something from my grandfather's journal. ""They feed on guilt and longing."" This thing wasn't Emma. It was wearing her face, using my grief as a weapon against me. Emma would never have wanted this. Emma would have wanted me to live, to forgive myself, to move on.

""You're not her,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt.

The thing wearing Emma's face smiled, and its teeth were definitely glass now. ""But I could be. Forever.""

I looked around the basement desperately. The workbench was covered with tools, scientific equipment, things my grandfather had used to study these creatures. And there, half-hidden under a pile of papers, was a crowbar.

""I'm sorry, Emma,"" I whispered, and I wasn't talking to the thing in front of me. I was talking to my real sister, wherever she was. ""I'm sorry for everything.""

Then I grabbed the crowbar and swung it as hard as I could into the center of the mosaic wall.

The sound was like a thousand windows breaking at once. The mirrors exploded in a shower of silver shards, and the scream that followed wasn't human. It was the sound of something vast and hungry being suddenly cut off from its food source. The thing wearing Emma's face dissolved like smoke, and all the other figures on the stairs simply vanished.

But I wasn't done. I could feel them still there, weakened but not destroyed. The convergence point was the cabin itself, my grandfather had said. The whole structure was a lens focusing their power.

I ran upstairs and grabbed a can of gasoline from the shed out back. The snow was still falling, thick and heavy, but I didn't feel the cold anymore. I had work to do.

I doused every room with gasoline, paying special attention to anywhere there might be reflective surfaces. The windows, the silverware, even the chrome fixtures in the bathroom. As I worked, I could hear them calling to me, pleading, threatening, promising. But their voices were fainter now, more distant.

When I was done, I stood in the doorway with a lit match in my hand. For a moment, I saw them all one last time, pressed against the windows from the inside. Emma was there, but this time she looked like herself again. She mouthed the words ""I love you"" and smiled, really smiled, before fading away.

I dropped the match.

The cabin went up like a bonfire, flames shooting fifty feet into the air. The heat was so intense it melted the snow for a hundred yards in every direction. And as the fire consumed the building, I heard one final sound. Not screaming this time, but something like relief. Like a long-held breath being finally released.

I walked to my truck and drove away without looking back. The mirrors were gone, but I kept my eyes on the road anyway. Some habits are worth keeping.

It's been six months now, and I haven't seen Emma or any of the others since that night. I've moved to a new city, gotten a new job, started fresh. But I still follow some of my grandfather's rules. I keep lights on after dark, and I'm careful around mirrors. Not because I'm afraid of what I might see, but because I want to honor the memory of a man who spent fifteen years fighting monsters to protect people he'd never meet.

And sometimes, late at night when I'm feeling particularly guilty about something, I remember what I learned in that basement. Grief is natural. Missing the people we've lost is human. But letting that grief consume us, letting it become a doorway for something else to crawl through, that's the real monster.

Emma is gone. She's been gone for five years. But the love I have for her, the good memories, the lessons she taught me, those are still here. Those are still mine. And no hungry thing from the space between reflections can ever take those away.

The rules my grandfather left weren't just about surviving the things in the mirrors. They were about surviving grief itself. About not letting the darkness convince you that joining the dead is better than living with their loss.

Sometimes I still hear voices calling my name in the wind. But now I know the difference between the real echoes of love and the false promises of hungry things that wear familiar faces.

And I never, ever answer.

You won't believe the day I had!

So, Wednesday, I bought floor tiles for my entire house from Yasian on Mombasa Road, Fast forward to unloading them, and BAM! One box had ripped open during transit and saw a tile I didn’t recognize.  

My heart sank as I counted the 63 tiles in the transport that was not mine . 😩 Had I just been scammed!  I remembered counting the boxes when they were loaded onto my transport, but checking the actual tiles! Nah, who does that?!

Then the lies started flowing like a broken faucet: ""Oh, the tiles you picked were out of stock, so you chose these others!"" I mean, seriously? 

I checked the code on the receipt , and it was off by one measly digit. I was absolutely flabbergasted. My driver told me to go back first thing in the morning and raise hell. 

I spent the whole night going over the day events and rehearsing the verbal backlash I was getting ready to give that lying sales lady, 

I arrived bright and early, ready for battle. I walk in and sit down, no “hello”, “good morning” , “can I help you” , “do you want a coffee” today. Crickets!!!!

 I went Straight to the manager and went, full-blown Karen mode. I laid out my case, and of course, she denied everything. But then, a moment of pure genius struck. 

The tiles I wanted were Ksh 1,900. The ones she gave me were Ksh 1,700. I remembered asking for a discount, and she'd quoted Ksh 1,850. So I casually asked the manager, ""When she came to you to ask for a discount, how much was it?"" He confirmed: ""Ksh 1,800."" BOOM! 💥 

I went full Morty smug mode. I asked him, ""Do customers usually beg you to pay more?"" He just said, ""I see your point."" Victory! He apologized, gave me another discount (Ksh 1,900 down to Ksh 1,790!), and even covered transport. WIN #1! 🎉

Now, since I was already on Mombasa Road, I remembered I had two packages waiting for me at Savo Store since May. 

Feeling like I'd just conquered Everest, so I decided to man up and walk. Let me tell you, walking on Mombasa Road with all that construction is an extreme sport. 

No sidewalks, open sewage lines, As I was mid-jump over an open sewer, my left JBL earbud fell right into the sewage. 🤢 My heart sank again. Dejected, I figured, ""Whatever, I'll buy new ones. This won't ruin my epic day!""

An hour later, I finally found Savo Store, picked up my packages, and then... HUH?! One of the packages was a pair of JBL over-ear headphones. And they weren't mine. But get this: the Amazon packaging was addressed to me! 🤯 I frantically checked my emails and Amazon account – no JBL headphone purchases. After a quick inquiry, the store staff basically shrugged and said, ""You paid for shipping, so you can keep 'em!""

Seriously, Reddit, make this make sense: I drop my JBL earbud into the sewage, and within the same hour, I magically acquire a brand new pair of JBL headphones, for free, addressed to me?! 🤯 The universe literally said, ""Nah fam, you deserve an upgrade after that tile ordeal.""

So long story made short I matched with a fellow maybe about 4 years ago. And through time we've texted we've stayed in touch he's always very kind he has his act together. Been wanting to meet him for a while I think it was last fall I said hey let's meet up sometime and he's like oh I'm dating somebody and I'm like oh okay? Needless to say he reached out to me today and said hey how you been I said oh I've been good what's new with you when he's like I'm traveling and I'm busy working and all that. So I asked him again if would you ever like to meet up for a tea or a coffee we've known each other for years here online. 
He says well I have a girlfriend or I'm dating somebody. This seems like a stupid response if he's not interested we shouldn't have stayed in touch all these years. 
Is that a valid response I would never even if I was seriously dating somebody I would never say to them oh I'm dating somebody but I don't want to date him I only know him through text I don't know him in real life should I be offended?

there’s this shame and guilt that comes with it. i spend way too much money on these damn things, and am actively contributing to our already severe pollution. i smoke juuls and have been smoking a pod a day for the past 4 years probably. i feel extremely ashamed of myself anytime i start to think about the habit, but when i really really look inwards, i still don’t want to quit. 

i’m wheezy and it’s a waste of money, im irritable without it and i hate the power that it has over me, but i still don’t want to quit. i enjoy it so much im afraid i sound like a psychopath. 

i smoke weed too and there’s nothing quite like finishing a doobie and getting a nice minty hit from my juul. after a meal, vape. after coffee, vape. enjoying a moment, vape. i feel like such a dumb ass but every time i read info and tips on quitting, it just makes me more frustrated and want to hold on tighter. 

i don’t want to do this anymore but i don’t know how to change my brain and stop thinking about it. some people said 7 months in and they’re still thinking about vaping. i’m scared i will have quit for a month or so, and the cravings will comeback tenfold and i’ll give in. i don’t know if im asking for advice or just some empathy but im so tired of feeling insane. 

i do struggle with my mental health otherwise but im becoming increasingly aware of how bad vaping is, but i just don’t want to stop. if the government is going to shit and everything is fucking terrible anyway, what does it matter if i’m accelerating my slow demise a little bit? idk i guess im just blabbing at this point. thanks for reading.

**Method (for 1 cup):**

1. Add 1 tbsp coffee powder (I use a 80:20 mix of coffee:chicory) into the upper chamber of the filter.
2. Gently press it down with the umbrella disc.
3. Pour just 15 ml of hot water and wait 1 minute. This helps the powder bloom and release aroma.
4. Pour 45 ml of hot water and close the lid. I use less water for a stronger decoction.
5. Let the decoction drip slowly (takes around 15 mins).
6. It gives 2–3 tbsp of decoction. Pour it into a cup.
7. Boil 60 ml of milk with 1 tsp sugar (or to taste).
8. Pour the milk from a height into the cup.

* Do you use more powder?
* Different ratios?
* Any secret tricks or brands you swear by?

1m2am5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1m2am5e/the_neighbors_panties_in_my_bed_heres_your_invite/,The Neighbor's Panties in My Bed? Here's Your Invite to Nightmare,"Halfway through my shower, the doorbell rang.
I ignored it. It rang again.
I stepped out of the bathroom and opened the door to find a girl standing outside.
""I'm your new neighbor. I left something at your place—mind if I grab it real quick?""
Before I could agree, she rushed straight to my room, pulled out a pair of lace panties from under my fiancé's pillow, and said with a flushed face:
""My water got cut off yesterday, and I was desperate, so I came over to use your shower. Hope you don't mind.""
She left with her underwear, and I slumped back onto my couch in a daze.
After sitting there for what felt like forever, I finally got up—only to feel something weird under the cushions.
I pulled it out and instantly hurled it across the room—it was a goddamn used condom?!

Bile shot up my throat.

I couldn't hold it back anymore. I bolted to the bathroom and threw up until I was seeing stars.

I was so out of it that I didn't even notice when Rhett came home and found me there.

""Wren, babe, what's wrong?""

The concern in his eyes looked genuine enough. He helped me to my feet, his hand steady on my shoulder.

""What happened? Should I take you to the hospital?""

I stared at his face—not a single crack in that perfect mask.

Doubt began creeping into my mind—was I being too paranoid?

A pair of underwear and a used condom didn't necessarily mean anything.

Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.

Maybe I was just being crazy.

My eyes were bloodshot as Rhett helped me onto the couch. I wrapped my hands around the warm water he'd brought me and shook my head.

""I'm fine. Probably just caught a chill last night.""

Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were kids.

I shouldn't be doubting twenty-five years of history between us.

I shouldn't be tearing down the walls of trust we'd built together over some stupid paranoia.

I pulled myself together and gave him a reassuring smile. ""Really, I'm okay. Don't worry about it.""

Our wedding was just around the corner.

Nobody wants their relationship to fall apart right before their big day—including me. 

Rhett gently stroked my hair and said, ""Let me make you some vegetable soup.""

I nodded, watching his retreating figure with a warm feeling in my heart.

Right as I was scrolling through TikTok, waiting for the soup, the doorbell rang again.

I stayed put on the couch and heard Rhett call out:

""Wren, can you get that? I'm kinda tied up here.""

I glanced toward the kitchen where he was locked in battle with some hairy crabs.

I laughed and went to open the door, only to find that same neighbor girl standing outside.

She scratched her head sheepishly. ""I didn't cook tonight. Mind if I crash your dinner?""

The apartment across the hall had been empty for two years. Suddenly there's a new neighbor, and I had no clue about it?

What kind of person moves in and immediately shows up asking for free meals?

I was about to tell her no when she looped her arm through mine and held up a cup of bubble tea.

""I brought boba! The more the merrier, right? And don't worry—I'll totally take your garbage away when I leave!""

She didn't give me a chance to refuse, practically dragging me back inside.

As the same time, Rhett emerged from the kitchen carrying a bowl of soup, smiling as he asked:

""Who was it?""

When he saw the neighbor girl's face, his expression went stone cold.

She chirped up playfully: ""Hey there, Rhett! I'm here to mooch some food. Your girlfriend invited me—hope that's cool?""

Rhett's gaze shifted to me.

I didn't bother sugarcoating it. ""I never did that.""

I yanked my arm free from the neighbor's grip. Pointing at the bubble tea, I said to Rhett, ""Looks like you've been having a grand time while I was away.""

I'm not the type to suffer in silence.

There's no way Rhett couldn't see this girl had ulterior motives.

Maybe he was waiting for me to give him an out—waiting for me to say, ""Yeah, I totally invited her over for dinner.""

But I didn't want to.

I locked eyes with him, demanding an answer.

Just like when we were kids and someone tried to come between us, Rhett would always say the same thing:

""In this whole wide world, Wren comes first. Of course I'm choosing Wren.""

I looked at Rhett, then at the neighbor girl, whose eyes were suddenly welling up with tears. She slammed the bubble tea down on the table and snapped:

""I seriously didn't mean anything by it! My power and water got cut off yesterday, so I came over to use your shower. I just wanted to thank you guys today—that's why I brought the boba!""

Her tears started streaming down.

""Do you really have to give me the cold shoulder like this?""

I still didn't respond. I kept my eyes locked on Rhett. He rubbed his temples, then walked over to the table, picked up the bubble tea, and handed it back to her.

""My girlfriend doesn't mess around. Letting you in yesterday was my mistake. You should go.""

The neighbor broke down even harder. ""We didn't do anything! Why is she acting like I'm some homewrecker?""

She made it sound like I was the one in the wrong.

But that condom on my couch, and the red hair I'd found—it was the exact same shade as this neighbor girl's.

I had no idea when Rhett, who usually kept strangers at arm's length, had become so generous that he'd let some random person into our home. Into our bathroom, no less.

A guy and a girl alone together. Who knows what could happen?

The neighbor turned her tear-streaked face toward me.

""I was just trying to be nice! You're the one with a dirty mind, so of course everything looks dirty to you! I just moved in—I don't want drama with my neighbors, but you're being way too much!""

By all logic, Rhett had asked her to leave. If she had any shame, she would've walked out. But she kept standing there, putting on a show. For whose benefit?

I looked at her, completely unmoved by her guilt trip.

""Fine. I'm being too much.""

I threw the door wide open.

""Please leave!""

This time, the neighbor couldn't stick around. She stamped her foot and ran out crying. The apartment fell dead silent. Rhett gave me a look that said he was at his wit's end.

""Wren, don't you think you went too far?""

Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were in diapers. When we were seventeen, Rhett bought up every firework in the entire city just to get me to agree to be his girlfriend, confessing his love under that dazzling display of lights.

""Wren, do you want to date me with marriage and growing old together as our endgame?""

I looked at my boy, trembling as he poured his heart out, and threw myself into his arms with tears in my eyes.

Our relationship had been smooth sailing ever since. Everyone envied me for having such a perfect childhood-friend-turned-fiancé.

And now, here he was, taking some random girl's side against me.

""You know how important reputation is to a girl. What you just said could get her labeled as a homewrecker!""

""Wren,"" Rhett walked past me, deliberately bumping my shoulder hard enough to make me stumble back. ""I was just trying to save your face, but that doesn't mean I think you were right.""

With that, He stormed out, leaving me alone with the lingering smell of soup.

Was I wrong?

Had I messed up?

When I was spiraling into self-doubt, my phone buzzed with a friend request notification.

My heart skipped a beat as I saw videos from an unknown sender.

In the footage, Rhett was sitting on our couch with the neighbor girl, helping her blow out candles on a cake. His voice was sickeningly sweet:

""Happy Valentine's Day, babe.""

They kissed passionately.

They did the most intimate things imaginable in my apartment.

They were going at it in my bathtub, water sloshing everywhere like my heart was being dragged through broken glass, blood seeping from every wound. I watched the neighbor girl laugh brightly, making cute poses with Rhett for the camera.

""Today's me and Rhett's first Valentine's Day together! We're gonna have so many more!""

She asked him with a giggle: ""Will living next door to you cause problems?""

Rhett's face was flushed with alcohol as he pulled her closer.

""Nah. Wren and I go way back—she'd never suspect a thing. If I'm choosing to be with you, I'll protect you.""

The video cut to the present, showing the girl crying while Rhett held and comforted her: ""Wren's just blunt—she cares too much about me. Don't take it personally!""

""I promise I won't touch Wren anymore!""

""I'll save myself for you.""

The girl sobbed in his arms: ""But she saw right through me! I was just standing there, and she already hated me.""

""I wasn't trying to cause trouble—I just wanted to see you, babe.""

""What did I do wrong to deserve this?""

I watched Rhett's face fill with sympathy as he soothed her: ""Don't worry. I'll spend the next few days with you.""

The video ended abruptly.

A message followed: [Wren, think your wedding's still happening on schedule?]

My fingers went numb.

The trembling crawled from my fingertips through my entire body until even my teeth were chattering. The love I'd been so proud of, the man I'd trusted completely, had just delivered the truth in the cruelest possible way.

I forced myself to breathe to stay sane. I saved all the evidence and sent it to my best friend:

[Rhett and I are done.]

When I was sixteen, I caught my dad cheating with his secretary. When I confronted him through my tears, asking why he'd do this to us, he just threatened me not to tell my mom. He was so sure Mom would fall apart if she knew the truth.

I didn't believe him. I ran to my mother, crying as I told her about Dad's betrayal.

Later, my mom really did jump from our apartment balcony.

I never had a mother again.

That summer, I lost my mom and my dad. I became an outsider, shuffled between relatives who took me in out of obligation.

Rhett was the one who stayed with me through it all.

Rhett was the one who told me with absolute certainty:

""Wren, even if you lose everything else, you'll always have me.""

Now, Rhett—I don't have you anymore either.

I sat like a zombie in the coffee shop, watching my best friend point at the girl in the video and curse: ""This basic bit//ch isn't even that pretty! How did she catch Rhett's eye? Remember when the actual school beauty was chasing him, and he wouldn't even look at her twice! How did he turn into this?""

My friend got more worked up as she ranted, finally slamming her hand on the table.

""I'm gonna find that asshole!""

""This is such nonsense!""

""That homewrecker basically moved in next door to mess with you—there's no way we're taking this lying down!""

My best friend was so pissed she called Rhett.

Same as always.

Every time Rhett and I got into fights or gave each other the cold shoulder, my girl would go to bat for me, and Rhett would always take his scolding like a good boy. But this time, after she'd called him ten times, he finally picked up.

""Wren, I know you're listening.""

His cold voice came through the speaker.

""Every time we have issues, you always drag a third person into it. You think that's actually healthy?""

""Could you please grow up?"" Rhett said with zero warmth. ""This nonsense is just pushing us further apart!""

""Wren, don't make me regret choosing to marry you.""

After that, he hung up.

My friend exploded: ""That asshole! Say that to my face, you coward!""

She immediately called him again, but Rhett had actually blocked her.

She was so mad she wanted to drag me over to catch Rhett in the act.

Suddenly, I remembered that our wedding was next week. I'd spent almost two years planning this thing, down to every single centerpiece on every table.

Now? I let out a bitter laugh.

Suddenly I understood what my dad had meant when he said:

""Wren, don't drag your mom into this. She'll be the one who gets hurt.""

My dad's voice overlapped with Rhett's in my head.

""Don't make me regret marrying your mother.""

""What guy doesn't screw up? Life's boring when it's all peaceful. Who wants to choose bland forever?"" My dad's expression merged with Rhett's: ""I don't want a life without any excitement.""

Something in my heart suddenly felt... free. I grabbed my stuff and stood up from the table.

""Summer.""

""I figured it out.""

""Figured what out?""

The dark cloud that had been crushing my heart just... disappeared. I felt lighter.

I smiled at Summer.

""I figured out my next move.""

""Maybe I really shouldn't have tied my entire life to love,"" I wiped away the tears streaming down my face. ""Besides love, the person I should love most is myself.""

""Before my mom died, she told me: if someone hits you, hit them back; if someone bullies you, get them back! Never let yourself be at a disadvantage, never allow yourself to suffer even the slightest injustice in this world!""

I looked at her, seeing tears sparkling in her eyes, and told her:

""Rhett's the one who screwed me over. Rhett's the one who manipulated me. Why should I pay for his mistakes?""

I've never been the nice girl.

...

The night before the wedding, Rhett finally called me: ""Wren, I'm picking you up tomorrow. Stop throwing tantrums.""

""Got it?""

I listened to his commanding tone and almost laughed.

I'd already moved all my stuff out of our apartment. He probably hadn't been back there in so long he didn't even notice.

I didn't answer.

Rhett continued: ""We're about to be married. You can't keep acting like a child.""

I heard a girl's voice whining in the background: ""Rhett, baby...""

He immediately said to me: ""I've got stuff to do. Gotta go.""

...

On the wedding day, Rhett's eyes were full of love as he watched the veiled bride walk toward him. He smiled and gently took her hand like nothing had ever changed.

The moment he touched the bride's hand, all the lights in the venue went out.

When they came back on, the entire room erupted.

The screens were playing footage of Rhett and his neighbor Ivy getting intimate.

""That's not the bride! Who is that?""

""Is that his side piece?""

The Blackwood family looked mortified.

""Rhett, what is going on?""

Rhett's heart was pounding out. He instinctively looked at the bride, who lifted her veil to meet his gaze.

Rhett stared in disbelief at Ivy suddenly standing before him. Before he could process what was happening, he heard her scream:

   The light is blinding.

   As old as you get, you never truly get used to the sensitivity in your eyes as you first blink away the sweet, blissful darkness of sleep. As my eyes opened to the glare of an uncovered window, I came once again to such a revelation before letting out a grumble and turning my back to the hard mattress I slept on. Staring up at the ceiling fan that slowly rounded its continuous circles overhead, my thoughts drifted back to work. Work, yet again. Jan always said I thought too much of work. Maybe she was right. Crime doesn’t stop, but in this town it sure came slowly. Too slowly.

   As I laid in bed, my thoughts were interrupted by the familiar chime of my cell phone vibrating and ringing on the nightstand. With a sigh escaping my lips, I reached over and picked up the phone, flipping it open so I could bring it to my ear.   “Yeah?” I grumbled out through a dry mouth, my vocal chords still warming up for use.

   “Sheriff? It’s Ann. I couldn’t get a hold of you on the radio.”

   “Radio… What time is it?”

   “It’s nine in the mornin’... did I wake you?”

   “No, no… I was already up.” I lied as my eyes drifted to the alarm clock on the nightstand. Five past nine. 

   “Right, right…” Ann said in a sarcastic voice, before divulging the root cause of the phone call. “There’s a deer carcass on County Road 14. Deputy Williams is already out at Henry’s place dealing with another trespasser call. That just leaves you for this.”   “What about Guy? Don’t we tell him when we got roadkill for him?”

   “Usually… ‘cept the caller told me the deer seemed pretty messed up, and, quote, ‘a car must’ve been goin’ fast as hell to make that mess.’ I didn’t figure there was anything left so I’m throwing the call to you.” As Ann gave the details, a hand swept over my face as my legs swung out, carrying the rest of my body into an upright position so that I could sit up on the edge of my bed.   “Alright, alright… I’ll head out there, I'll radio you when I'm there.” 

   “Okay Sheriff… stay safe.”

   “Thanks Ann.” Click. The phone call disconnected, and I swung the flip phone closed. A moment of silence lulled over me as my eyes drifted back to the window. I would say this would be just another day… but today was different. Today was an anniversary, an annual reminder of the one crime I have since failed to solve, and am still working to solve… though the progress was slow, a standstill, it was not going to go cold. Not while I was still breathing. I didn’t dwell for too long, however, as I rose, stretched, and moved to the kitchen to turn on the coffee pot before getting dressed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

   The drive was short enough. The county, for all intents and purposes, was tiny. So tiny, in fact, that the state, and more importantly the town, only felt the need for me and a few deputies to police both the town and the county. One worked nights, the other worked days, and the other covered extra shifts and worked the weekends. As much as I disapproved of them keeping our funding low, the county saw considerably less crime than nearly any other county given how out of the way we are from any major road or city. The town, however, wasn’t a “One Stop Light” kind of town… we had two. Though, the mayor would see it fit to add a third light before I'm ever allowed to hire another deputy, but it’s my cross to bear for the time being. Though, it would have been nice if I had more manpower so I didn’t have to go and deal with a carcass on the side of the road.

   Then again, the only people we get are the farmers and rednecks who are very and proudly armed, and way out in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere to be robbed. That, and empty vacation homes that are only occupied in the fall or summer for a few weeks at a time, with alarm systems that get tripped by the odd raccoon or possum. This county could police itself, but here we are.

   Those thoughts tumbled through my mind as I took one final sip of coffee out of my cup, and got out of my truck to assess the damaged carcass left on the side of the road. As I exited my truck, the scent of rot was already wafting through the air, the nausea-inducing smell invading my nostrils and putting up tents to camp there as I walked up to the mangled mess that hardly resembled a deer. The doe in question had a head and hooves, but as for the rest of its body? It resembled something akin to a meat pudding. The body and legs were nothing more than a puddle of goopy, bloody meat and fur. The sight was sickening, even to someone who’s seen countless dead bodies. This was… something else entirely.

   I would love to say the scene was a surprise, however, but unfortunately it wasn’t the first one. Since around five years ago, bodies like this have been popping up on occasion around the county. We had to have moved and cleaned up around a hundred or so, but after about thirty I stopped counting, so the number could be any value at this point. It was always the same. Early in the morning, some passerby would spot it and report it. Ann, our dispatcher, always asked the same question.

   “Is the torso intact?” 

   If they said yes, Ann would call Guy Miller, one of the county’s more destitute residents who feeds his family with roadkill left behind by unfortunate drivers. If they said no, though, it would get one of us. We would come out, take some photos, and toss what we could toss off into the ditch for the other animals lurking in the woods. I had a  running theory about a poacher getting their sick morbid thrills out on butchering and destroying the wildlife, but we haven’t found anything to support it. It was just another strange thing in the Appalachian woods we have to deal with.

   I grimaced at the sight, but put on my gloves anyway to walk the head and hooves to the edge of the woodline by the road. There wasn’t a ditch here, this road was fairly small and made of dirt. I only had to walk a short distance to get to the woodline. Throwing down the hunks of body parts with wet thumps against soft grass, I took a moment to peel off my gloves and wipe the sweat from my forehead. It was a hot one today. However, looking around, I noticed something on one of the trees. Scratch marks.

   I walked around the bloody pile I made, and over to the marks to look at them. I’m used to seeing scratches, with how the bucks like to rub their antlers against the trees and mark them, but these were different. Being closer, I could see they were claw marks instead of scratches. Sideways scrapes, deeply gouged into the tree. Four individual marks. It couldn’t have been a bear, the gouges were deeper than any bear mark I had ever seen… so what caused it? I didn’t get the chance to ponder as the radio mic by my shoulder, attached to my vest, crackled.  

“S-01, status check.” I let out a sigh.

   “All clear, dispatch. Go ahead and show me at 81 Deer Run Drive.”

   “Copy, I'm clear.” I lowered my hand from the radio mic, and took one final look at the claw marks before turning to head back to my truck.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

   As I pulled into the gate of the dirt driveway, I took a moment to stop and look around. 81 Deer Run Drive is the Wilkins’ place. I have come here every year since little eight year old Joey Wilkins disappeared from their home about four years ago. Today was the fifth year anniversary. Five years since I got that call. I took a breath, bracing myself before I drove down the driveway, and pulled up to the house. Getting out, I walked up to the house. No knock was needed, Mary Wilkins already had the door open.   

“Hey Mary.”   “Sheriff. How’ve you been, David?” She extended her arms out, and wrapped me up in a warm, motherly hug.   

“Oh, y’know... work, work, and more work…” I chuckled, trying to lighten the air. It was in vain. She knew why I was here, and this day was always heavy on her. Though, I noticed she had improved some. She was usually in tears by the time she saw me, especially empty-handed. I began to wonder if she had lost hope. I hadn’t.  

“I get it… Come on in.” She waved me in, and I stepped in, resting a hand on my duty belt as I turned, and let her walk ahead to the living room.   

“You want some tea? Just made some.”   

“Of course. You always know how to make it just right. Reminds me of how Jan used to make it.” That earned a small smile from her, and she disappeared into the kitchen next door. I took a moment to look around the living room. Family photos were up on the mantle of the fireplace, Mary and her husband Will Wilkins. He was unfortunately named, but it didn’t stop me from laughing about it face-to-face with him. He had a good sense of humor… at least, before everything.   Some of the photos were turned down. I knew it was the photos with Joey in them. I reached and lifted one up. That family, happy and without a care in the world. It was a fishing trip, and young Joey was holding up a small bass. He looked so proud of it, and so were Mary and Will, standing behind him. Will had to help him keep the fishing pole up. It put a smile on my own face, a sad one to see how happy this family used to be. I set the photo down when I heard Mary coming back in, and I turned to take the glass of tea from her that she offered.  

“Thanks, Mary.”  

“Course, Sheriff.” She sat down on the couch, and I sat across from her on a different couch.  

“How’s Will been? He workin’?”   

“Yeah, he’s out right now. He’s been alright, today’s got him a bit… down.” Her lips turned to a frown, her eyes welling with tears. I just sat there, still, aside from taking the occasional sip of sweet tea from the glass.   

“Sheriff… I saw the look on your face when you came in. You don’t have any information, do you?” Mary kept her wet eyes on me, her face contorted back with the prospect of the painful answer I was going to have to give her. I didn’t want to give that answer, and I knew Mary didn’t want to hear it.

“No, Mary… I haven’t found anything yet.” The floodgates released, and tears crawled down her cheeks. She sniffed a couple of times as she fought back a sob, bringing the collar of her t-shirt up to wipe away the tears from her face.   

“I’m not going to stop looking… I haven’t. You’re good people, you deserve to know the answer. I’ve been working tirelessly to find him, to get Joey back h-...” I was rambling out words, trying to make Mary feel better, but she cut me off before I could continue.  

“David, it’s okay, I know… Please.” She leaned forward, offering a sad smile to me that helped to shut me up. The smile, while warm and comforting, was countered by the eyes. Those bonnie blues, filled with sorrow and pain. It was hard to look at now. Used to, her look would lift my spirits. Had either of us not been married, maybe things would have been different…

   I spent another twenty or so minutes at the house, listening to Mary as she cried and comforting her, cracking some jokes and laughing, and trying to ease her spirit before I walked out of the door. I gave a wave back, and stepped to the truck to open the door and get in. As I closed the door and gave one last look at the house, something moved in the corner of my eye. Turning my eyes to where it was, it looked like something moved into the brush. Probably a deer, or a stray dog. I threw the truck in reverse, and backed out of the driveway.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

   Night was just starting to darken the wooded county, though my shift wasn’t going to end. It never really ended, I was the boss after all. I hate proving Jan right, but it was just like that before our divorce, then especially so after. I was on my third mug of coffee, and sitting off of the main road in a parking lot reading over reports when I had another deputy pull up next to me. It was Deputy Mattinson, the officer I hired for the night shift. Good guy. I don’t know why he likes the night shift.

  “Mattinson.”

   “Evenin’, Sheriff. Burnin’ the midnight oil?”

   “As usual, but I'm fixin’ to wrap up and drive home. I’ve had enough property line disputes for one day.” We both laughed, and went back to look at our respective computer terminals before the radio cackled to life.  

“All units, respond to 81 Deer Run Drive. All units, respond to 81 Deer Run Drive. Caller on the road by the home stated they heard banging and screaming. Unknown injuries at this time.” We both looked at each other, a moment of shock passing between us before we threw our vehicles into drive, and activated lights and sirens to haul ass to the Wilkins’ home. 

   Can this family not get any peace? Now someone was trying to take advantage of a family down on their luck, or God forbid they were yelling and fighting each other. Tensions were high with them, but I never knew Will to be an aggressive man. I white-knuckle gripped my steering wheel, trying my best not to get tunnel vision as I flew down the back roads to get to the driveway, with Mattinson following behind me. The radio crackled again during the drive.  

“All units, be advised. Caller nearby reported they heard gunshots in the area of 81 Deer Run Drive. Be careful.” Gunshots now? It escalated. My head felt light. I almost wanted to throw up as the pit in my stomach began to make me feel sick. I was flying down the road, admittedly faster than I should have… but it didn’t feel fast enough. I smacked the wheel a couple of times, letting out a yell into my front windshield as we got closer.

   Finally, the sight of a truck with its emergency flashers on came into view, stopped on the road next to the driveway. The caller watched, still on the phone with our dispatcher, as we drove past and onto 81 Deer Run Drive. We turned our sirens off when we got onto the driveway, and I moved to flip on my spotlight as we got to the front of the house. Already, before I was even able to get the light on the front of the house, I could see the front door was wide open with no trace of anyone. The inside was dark, and as I stepped out of my truck I could see blood stains on the front steps to the porch. As Mattinson got out, both of us drew our service weapons and ran up to the porch, and up to the front door.  

“Sheriff’s Department!” I shouted as I stepped in. The blood stains from the front steps ran through the door, and winded through to the living room and past into the kitchen. It was a sight, that crimson liquid smeared along the family’s house like they had gotten a new rug. I motioned for Mattinson to follow close as I turned on the light attached to my pistol and used its radiant beam to guide me through this newly formed hell-house.   

“Sheriff’s Department! If you’re here, call out!” I announced our entry again as we worked our way through to the kitchen, hoping I would be able to hear Mary or Will call out to us. There was once again no answer. As we walked through, I could smell the metallic scent of blood and gunpowder mixed with the scent of the house, an assault on the nostalgia of a smell I was familiar with that once again made me lightheaded. It only grew stronger as I stepped into the kitchen.   Within the kitchen was a massive pool of blood, smeared as if something was dragged through it. Along the counter and wall were marks of buckshot from a shotgun, and all of the kitchen cabinets were open. Items were strown everywhere, some soaking in the visceral pool of red on the vinyl flooring. I looked at Mattinson.  

“Clear the rest of the house. I’m going to check outside.” Mattinson looked reluctant. I could see it on his face, and he could most likely see it on mine. There was no amount of strength to mask the horror we both were seeing, and the fear we felt. I knew it, but I was trying not to show him. Mattinson gave me a nod.  

“Copy, Sheriff. Dispatch, we have blood. No signs of bodies. Continuing a search, have backup units step it up.” He spoke into the radio as he turned and began calling out to the rest of the house as he went to clear the rest of this floor, and the second floor. I turned to follow the smears. They went through the hallway and through the back door, which was also opened. I peeked out, looking around, and when I did… I saw her.

   Mary was lying in the back yard. She was bloodied, mangled into a mess. Her clothes were torn to shreds, tears of fabric laying open on the grass to expose the near-mashed heap of skin, organs, and bones that was her torso. It was a mess, and she was only recognizable through the eyes. I looked into them as I approached. Those bonnie blues. Even while she was deceased, they still carried the same weight of sorrow. Only now, it hurt worse. It hurt me deeply. What was worse was that she was laid out underneath the worn, run-down swing set they had built for Joey years ago. A cruel reminder, and an even crueler monument to loss.

  I didn’t say anything. She wasn’t alive. She couldn’t survive that, it was clear. My only concern was figuring out who did this to her. It looked as though someone spent their time with an axe, hitting her body over and over again until it was a mass of pulp. My flashlight shined out to the treeline, my left hand leaving my pistol to take the bigger flashlight off of my belt so that I could add to the lights I had shining.   

“Will! Will Wilkins! It’s the Sheriff! Come out!” There was silence, nothing that responded to my voice as I took deliberate steps around to check the sides of the house. I worked around, calling out again as I neared a shed that was set up closer to the back edge of the backyard. It was then that I heard him call out from the woods.  

“David! Help me, David! Please!” The voice was strained, laced with pain and fear. It sent a chill up my spine as I turned my flashlight to the treeline to try and find where Will called from. It was him. I knew it was him.  

“Will! Keep callin’ out, I'm comin’ to you!” I didn’t waste any time. I went straight into the woods. It was foolish, but we do foolish things in this line of work, risking our necks for the safety of others. Using my gun light to guide my way, I used my other flashlight to look around as I rushed forward. I heard him again.  

“David! Help me, David! Please!” He repeated the same line. I didn’t think much of it, he was surely scared and just yelling out the only thing he could think of. I didn’t even notice until I heard him repeat it for a third time. The same voice, the same tone. It was like a record stuck skipping to the same lyric.  

“Will! Just… stay there, bud, I'm almost to you!” I couldn’t tell if I was. In fact, I still had the house behind me, just barely visible in the trees. That was where I found a shotgun. A break-action double-barreled twelve gauge. The break was open, two shells hanging loosely from their chambers with some spare shells lying around it. There was blood on the gun. At least I knew who shot… but I didn’t see Will anywhere.   That was when I heard a second voice. Joey’s.  

“I’m scared… someone help me!” I blinked. Joey? There was no way he could be here. There’s no way his voice could still be this young sounding. It sounded like an eight year old kid, but Joey would have been thirteen by now. Maybe I didn’t hear it right… I couldn’t have heard it like that. There was no possible way… until I heard it a second time.  

“Sheriff… I see you. Help me, please!” That weepy voice… I knew Joey’s voice, and that sounded like it. I let out a sharp whistle, letting it ring through the dark Appalachian woods, trying to get Joey’s attention before I shouted again.  

“Joey! Joey, come to my light! Come out of the woods, it’s safe!” As I shouted, I moved the flashlight around. There was no response, no movement, and I didn’t hear Joey speak again. It gave me the chance to listen, to check my surroundings and focus on my senses. The woods were quiet. Where you usually hear owls hooting, birds chirping, crickets chirping and the annoying buzz of Cicadas… there was nothing. Completely still. Completely silent.   It helped me hear something moving in the leaves behind me. I turned, aiming my flashlight there just in time to see leaves settling from being moved. Someone was messing with me. Whoever this home invader was, this murderer… he was playing with a game, toying with me. I fired a couple of shots into the air.

   “Sheriff’s department! Come out and let me see your hands NOW!” I spun around, trying to watch the area. I almost tripped over Will’s shotgun as I spun. It almost sent me spiraling, until my flashlight shined on something. Someone.  

“Hands, hands, hands! Do it now!” I pointed my pistol at the man, taking aim. It finally let me see the full picture on what this ‘man’ truly was. It was tall, and thin. Not just thin, emaciated. Malnourished. It was hunched, crouched, its back facing me. The skin on the man was stretched taut, to the point the bones in its spine and shoulders threatened to pop out of the skin with how hard the skin clung to them. Its arms were long enough to reach the ground with ease, and long fingers sprawled out in the leaves. Long, bloody hands, adorned with massive claws. Its face turned to me.

   That face… that horrific face. This wasn’t a man, it was a monster. A monster, with a blood-covered face. Its lips were spread wide, showing sharped, fang teeth that had chunks of skin and viscera hanging from them, wedged between each dagger of a tooth. The eyes? Empty, hollow, sunken black eyes stared back at me. I was frozen. I didn’t know what this thing was… but I didn’t get the opportunity to try and rationalize it as the creature suddenly let out a cry, a beastly roar that shook me out of my state of shock. At the same moment, I heard Deputy Mattinson yell out from the house. 

“Sheriff! Where are you?!”

   As it began to crawl quickly towards me, I turned and began to run in the direction of the house. I only got about halfway before I felt the monster tackle me from behind. Fight or flight kicked in as I hit the ground, my flashlight flying from my hand. I had been lucky enough to have my gun still in my hand on the fall, but as I brought it up the monster swiped its large hand towards it and knocked the gun away, the flashlight-adorned handgun spinning off to the side. It was then I felt the creature’s claws dig into my sides, yanking and tearing at my skin as it cut through my vest, my shirt, and my undershirt. I let out a cry of pain.   As the thing went to lift its claw again, it licked at the blood on its fingers. I felt it shake, a tremor as it tasted my blood and went for more. However, it didn’t get the chance as a flurry of shots rang out from over my head. I saw the lithe being jolt and jerk as bullets hit its skin, and was forced to retreat into the woods. Its speed was incomprehensible as it vanished into the darkness, especially for crawling on all fours. Mattinson ran to my side, pulling a first aid kit from his vest to begin working.  

“Sheriff! Sheriff, come on man, stay with me!” As he worked, I heard distant sirens as the backup surely called by Ann was arriving. I didn’t focus on it, however, as I stared up at a light in the trees. Some clear, white light that was shining into my eyes.  As bright as it looked, and as bright as it continued to grow, I couldn't look away.

The light.

1m2agrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1m2agrk/thinking_of_you/,Thinking of you,"Hey Bub,

Next month, today would have been our 2nd anniversary. Maybe you're reading this, maybe not, but either way, I just wanted to get this out of my heart and onto the page, and you know how much I love writing my letters lol. It's easier for me to write them than say them.  I want to acknowledge my faults in our relationship, and I am taking accountability for not showing up for you when you needed me the most. I won't get into all the nitty-gritty details, but being in therapy has really made me reflect on us, on where I didn't show up for you the way I should have. I didn’t protect your peace. I didn’t make you feel consistently safe, secure, and chosen. And I hate that. Because you deserve that. I also learned what I should've done differently in every situation where things got rocky.

You gave so much of yourself to me, your energy, your love, your patience. I know there were times you felt alone in our relationship, also while we were long-distance, carrying so much emotional weight. That shouldn't have happened. It was my first long-distance experience, and it was tough to navigate. I truly wish I had known how to do things differently so you didn't feel so alone, especially knowing how tough work was for you. I didn’t always hear you, and that silence made you feel like you weren’t a priority. But I hear you now. I finally understand.

It's easy to get lost in the tough times, but I also want to remember all the highlights, how we always overcame things, and how much stronger we became. This is not me minimizing the issues that arose in our relationship. Therapy made me take a closer look at myself. I know I'm not perfect, and I'm not trying to be. All I can do is be better in the future, for myself and us. It made me realize why I sometimes put up walls, why I'm scared to have those tough conversations, it's a protection based on past stuff, and none of it was your fault, or anyone's fault. I’m not the same man who let you down. 

I still love you, Bub. That hasn’t changed.

We had our ebbs and flows. Some days you might've loved me more, and the next day I'd love you more, and then we'd both be all-in. We don't have to try so hard; we just have to do. Do the things that make each of us happy, have those tough conversations in the moment, and always communicate how we're feeling. Just do what we have to do. Relationships are never 50/50. Some days you might be at 20, and I need to give 80, and vice versa, so we're always at 100 together. This is something I've truly learned.

I've been doing the work, not just for us, but for me. I'm learning to show up fully, to be present, to be the man I know I can be and the man you deserve. This journey in therapy has been eye-opening. It's been about digging deep, understanding my patterns, and not just pointing fingers. It's helped me see when I'm pulling away, when fear is trying to take over, and when I'm actively choosing a different path.

Therapy has given me the tools to truly listen without immediately getting defensive. I can sit with discomfort now and communicate openly rather than shutting down. This isn't just talk; it's a deep, personal commitment to growth that I'm seeing every day in how I handle situations, how I react, and how I communicate. It's taught me how to regulate my emotions, how to set healthy boundaries, and how to approach challenges with a clear head instead of letting past hurts dictate my present actions.

I know my pulling away hurt you and left you feeling unheard and alone, and I can't imagine how lonely that must have felt. When I shut down during difficult conversations or prioritized other things over us, I understand now that it left you feeling unheard and unimportant, which was never my intention, but was the reality of my actions. I’m sorry for not making you the priority you deserved. Moving forward, I’m committed to setting aside dedicated time for us and communicating openly, especially during busy seasons.

I know sometimes I got so caught up in life, in trying to better myself, that I lost sight of what mattered most, us. I let myself get too sucked into work, school, and even my hobbies, and I didn't always make the time for you that you deserved. Tennis season has always been a major time commitment, and it's been a pattern since we started talking that things don't go well for us during that time because all my focus gets pulled away. I should've communicated better about that and planned for it, just like I have in years past. I also realized I sometimes got so wrapped up in the idea of our future together that I didn't take the time to be truly present in the here and now.

I need to be more specific about my behavior. There were times when I chose my phone over conversations with you, times when work stress made me distant and irritable, and moments when I dismissed your concerns instead of truly listening. I know I sometimes made you feel like you were competing for my attention instead of being my priority.

That won't happen again. I vow to be better about that. I promise to always prioritize us, to always choose you, and to make sure you feel that choice in every action I take. My love for you isn't just a feeling; it's an action, a daily choice to understand, support, and cherish you. It's about building a foundation of trust and respect so strong that nothing can shake it. I'm committed to being a better listener, a stronger support, and to consistently choosing you, every single day, with intention and clarity. I will not get comfortable. I will keep falling in love with you every single day to make sure our love doesn't fade and that it lasts forever.

More than anything, my heart yearns for you even more than ever. You truly are the love of my life. I still love you and always will. I was serious about marrying you, and I remain serious. If it's not you, I don't see myself getting married to anyone else. I want to give you all the things you asked for, but my body and mind reacted in a way that dictated I didn't. This type of love was a new feeling for me, and my body was nervous, but a good nervous. Like, oh shit, this is about to get real, and our love is real. This love is different because with you, we could always be ourselves without judgment.

Above all else, I miss you. Not just the big moments, but all the small, beautiful things that made up our daily life. I miss your quirks, your laugh, your ""rahh rahhs"", the little habits that were uniquely you. I miss hearing you yapping about your day, or about something exciting that happened, how you'd get so incredibly hyped up for the simplest things. It's those little things, those moments that no one else would understand, that really hit me. They're the true heart of what it means to miss the love of your life. And no matter where you are right now, Chicago, Jersey, DC, or back home, I will always be there for you.

The way you'd light up, your laugh, even the silly disagreements that somehow always ended in a smile, it's all those tiny pieces that formed the big picture of us. I even find myself thinking about how we'd dance at our wedding, slow dancing to ""Snooze"" and then going wild to ""March Madness."" Those little dreams are still so clear. I envision us creating so many new memories and hobbies together, exploring things we both love, or even finding new ones.

Seeing my friends get married was tough; it's made me sad and has only made me miss you even more. All I could do was picture you and me walking down that aisle together, because more than anything in this world, I want to be your husband, and I want you to be my wife.

I've reflected on and written down all the good and bad from our relationship, from when we first started talking again in December 2022 until now. And I have to say, there are so many more good memories than bad ones. It's easy for the bad to stick and for those emotions to overpower the good, but we also have to remember all the incredible moments we shared, the laughter, the quiet comfort, the way we just get each other. Now I am not trying to downplay those bad times, because they were, but our comeback has always been stronger. Those good times are the real backbone of what we had, and what I believe we can have again.

I want to do this again, the right way, to build that future we talked about, getting engaged, getting married, having the family we dreamed of with our Frenchie. I'm ready to commit to that vision with the maturity and understanding I've gained. I'm already picturing little things we'd do, like our morning coffee routines or spontaneous weekend trips, and I hope those thoughts start to plant seeds in your mind, too, of what ""us"" could be again. Our village will love and support us every step of the way, just like they always have. I will listen, support you, and be the man you want and deserve. I understand that my showing up needs to be consistent and undeniable, and I'm prepared to prove that to you, not with words alone, but with every action. I promise to continue to show you the patience and grace that I showed you throughout our relationship.

I'm not trying to convince you to be with me right now, Bub. I'm just showing you that I've put in the work, deeply and honestly, to become a better version of myself, for me, and the possibility of us. I'm here, and I'm ready when you are. I don't need a response to this, I just wanted you to know where I'm at. Take all the time you need with this, and know that there's no pressure from me. Thank you for loving me the way you did.

Love,

Your Bub

So I asked him again if would you ever like to meet up for a tea or a coffee we've known each other for years here online. 
He says well I have a girlfriend or I'm dating somebody. This seems like a stupid response if he's not interested we shouldn't have stayed in touch all these years. 
Is that a valid response I would never even if I was seriously dating somebody I would never say to them oh I'm dating somebody but I don't want to date him I only know him through text I don't know him in real life should I be offended?

Franchised locally by Hayley and Adam Kaemingk, Toastique is located on the first floor of the new downtown Rapid City development at 612 6th St.

[Toastique Exterior at Block5](https://preview.redd.it/ys2zvkppbgdf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e02b8389754a1c8d1f3732daf94366a296de7b50)

Unlike any other health-focused concept, Toastique offers a menu that includes toast-focused creations with all-natural smoothies, acaí bowls, cold-pressed juices that are made on-site each morning with fresh ingredients and nutrients with no added sugar or preservatives, and more.

“Toastique has garnered national acclaim for its fresh and artistic approach to crafting exquisite food grounded in paying homage to the natural beauty and simplicity found in responsibly sourced ingredients,” Kaemingk said. “It’s perfect for morning meetups, mid-day breaks or casual brunches.”

[Avocado Smash](https://preview.redd.it/eumrgqoxbgdf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d17afefc968a36b47b5115eb375770134cfb6e08)

For your first visit, “you really can’t go wrong with the Avocado Smash Toast,” she added.  
  
“It’s a fan favorite that takes classic avocado toast to the next level with perfectly seasoned avocado, cherry tomatoes, watermelon radish, microgreens, and a drizzle of chili oil on hearty multigrain bread.”

Other popular picks include the Smoked Salmon Toast, which feels like a luxe bagel-and-lox moment reimagined, and the PB Crunch Toast — a sweet option topped with peanut butter, banana, granola, seasonal berries, and honey that’s super satisfying any time of day.

“If you’re leaning more toward bowls, the Blue Mystique Bowl and Mango Tango Bowl are both vibrant, refreshing, and packed with nutrients,” Kaemingk said .“And for something quick and energizing, guests love pairing a cold-pressed juice or a wellness shot with their meal.”

The 1,500-square-foot café is bright, modern and welcoming. Think clean lines, natural wood accents and a striking feature mural designed by the local franchisee herself.

“I was excited to include my love for art and graphic design skills by designing our Black Hills mural and curating the preserved moss wall with one of Toastique’s slogans on it,” Kaemingk said.

“In my past career as a lead designer for a local printing company, I designed a lot of artwork for many local businesses in town. So, it was nice to do something for our space.”

Her 15-year-old daughter, Eliot, is also an artist and painted a large canvas that hangs in the hallway, in addition to working on a few more smaller pieces to hang in other areas.

https://preview.redd.it/o39e2cn1cgdf1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dcd989fdcad735a15b1d4efd56351f56ac845e4

“The art is always a conversation piece,” Kaemingk said. “It is a great way for us to hold meaningful conversations with our guests, which is something we really cherish.”  
  
Kaemingk grew up in a family of franchise owners and is familiar with what it takes to succeed in the business model.

“Coming from a background in graphic design and photography, I was inspired to venture into a business where I could bring something meaningful and personal to my hometown,” she said.

“I was determined to find a concept that would be personally fulfilling to operate, which is how my husband and I landed on Toastique. It aligns perfectly with our shared passion for health and creativity, and we couldn’t be more excited to introduce Rapid City to a vibrant space that blends wellness, design, and community connection.”

Toastique filled a gap in the Rapid City market for health-focused dining options, she added.

“Toastique hit every mark for what we envisioned—a vibrant, wellness-driven menu, a brand ethos centered on health and community, and a proven track record of success,” Kaemingk said. “What truly set it apart, though, were the streamlined systems and the incredible support from the leadership team, which gave me the confidence to take this leap.

Block5 proved an ideal space for the business, locating it in the heart of downtown and in the same building as a [Hyatt Place Hotel](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-place/en-US/rapzr-hyatt-place-rapid-city-downtown?src=corp_lclb_google_seo_rapzr&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=lmr) and 131 new [loft apartments](https://www.block5lofts.com/).  


“Block5 is a perfect pairing for Toastique. We love the new space with large windows and walking access to other downtown events and stores, and how the sunshine comes in the windows in the afternoon. It is the bright and cheery place that we envisioned it to be,” Kaemingk said.

[Block5 Exterior](https://preview.redd.it/isvl6lcacgdf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08d95d68d90dd041ecec9692d33ace97e666c586)

“We have had so many other businesses stop in and welcome us to the downtown. That really means a lot to us as we are huge supporters of local businesses in our town.”

New residents have loved being able to walk down from their apartment, while hotel guests have stopped for a bite before heading out for the day.

“It’s been super busy so far,” Kaemingk said.“We are very fortunate to have seen such wonderful response so far from the local community, and we look forward to serving more and more people!”

Toastique is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.

im a 17 yr old and a few months back I started getting bad chest and breast aches/pains. the areas of pain would usually be on the side of my boob (outer or inner), above or underside and it would come and go. I would press on it and massage it until it went away or until I caved and took some ibuprofen. at first I thought it was due to the fact I drank a lot of energy drinks during this time. so I told my doctor and he told me to limit my intake to 5 a week. the pains didn't go away and I started straying away from caffeine all together (with only the occasional monster or coffee) and I didnt really go away. a few times I had used an ice pack to help. I had gotten used to the pains and aches and decided that I was probably fine because I'm young and my mother's side has no history of breast cancer. (unsure about my father's side as my paternal grandfather was adopted). but yesterday I woke up with serious nipple pain in my right breast. it was tender and sore and was painful to touch really. the area was warm and it felt like the pain was coming from deep within. I tried to feel for lumps but I found nothing out of the ordinary besides the usual lumpiness of fat ig. but it hurt to press down and it just felt so tender. now my left breast has started to feel the same nipple pain, not as severe but they feel heavy and itchy and sore. my mother doesn't really take my concerns seriously but I want to know if this is something I should talk to my doctor about or if im just paranoid and this is normal puberty stuff. please if you have any answers or ideas lmk I am so scared something is wrong with me.",2,1752765635.0,WomensHealth,1,1.0,False

Volunteer Observation

 

6/7: Easy Going, Good Manners, Good on Leash, Learns Quickly, Knows Sit/Shake/Down, Pottied Immediately, Social (Dogs/People), Love-Bug, Wants to Play/Run/Sniff, Solicits Pets            

6/8 DAYCATION: Grady had a great time on his daycation! While he’s not the biggest fan of car rides, he tolerated it just fine. He enjoyed going for a walk, especially his adventure on the Katy Trail, which was the highlight of his day. Grady was very friendly with strangers, always happy to make new friends, and remained calm and unfazed around other dogs. He didn’t encounter any cats or children during the outing.

On the leash, Grady walked well—he pulled a little but generally did a good job. He knows the ""sit"" command and showed good manners overall, though he could use some work on taking treats more gently. He's highly food motivated and seems very trainable. Grady loved sniffing around, playing, and getting pets. He didn’t potty right away but only went outside in the grass. He did get a bit hot and tired after a while, but overall, he was a very good dog—friendly, playful, and easygoing (unless you’re a squirrel).

 

6/13 DAYCATION: Grady had an absolute blast on his daycation! He loved riding in the car and brought tons of energy and enthusiasm to the day. He enjoyed going for a walk, splashing around in the water (his favorite part!), and lounging at a dog-friendly coffee shop.

Grady was super friendly with everyone he met and did great with the host’s daughter. He didn’t encounter any other dogs or cats, but his social personality really shined through.

On the leash, he was excited and ready to explore. While sitting still wasn’t on his agenda—he was too busy having fun—he still showed good manners. Grady was a total love bug who enjoyed cuddles and sniffing around.

Best part of the day: Definitely playing in the water!

A fun-loving, affectionate pup who made the most of every minute.

 

 

Playgroup Observation

PG1-Social/DG-Dainty & Gentle

6/2: Gentle and dainty, warming up to things and beginning to interact with the group more as they warm up. Would begin socializing after feeling more comfortable.

I have some specific questions about having ADHD, being from another country and living in Basel, CH. I have asked around in my personal circle, and no one was able to tell me what I need to know, specially regarding how to get my prescription (issued in my country of birth) to be accepted in CH.

I would be glad if anyone with experiences on this matter could talk to me. We can speak about it over coffee or beer, which of course would be on me :)

It never fails to amaze me how grown-ass adults—working at one of the biggest banks in the world—still treat handwashing like it’s optional. Like, did y’all skip the global pandemic? Did you sleep through the last 20 years of basic hygiene PSAs? Or are we just raw-dogging germs now as a lifestyle?

And now, here we are—reluctantly shoved back into full-time return-to-office life. After years of remote work, where our biggest hygiene concern was whether our coffee mug had mold, we’re suddenly expected to share bathrooms, keyboards, and handshakes again. Cool. Love that for us.  Unless I’m shaking poo and pee particles.  

But what’s not cool? Watching grown adults leave a stall like they just dropped a nuclear payload… and then walk right past the sink like they’re late for a meeting with God. No rinse, no soap, no shame. Just straight out into the wild with poop particles riding shotgun.

Let’s not forget the urinal dashers—hit their stream, shake it twice, and back to their desk like they didn’t just bring a sprinkle of pee into every spreadsheet they touch. And then there are the nose-blowers who treat paper towels like magical bacteria erasers, casually dabbing snot and heading out like it’s totally fine.

It’s not fine. It’s gross.

We didn’t want to be back in person, but fine—we’re here. You’ve got your badge, your office chair, your passive-aggressive Teams messages. Great. Now all I ask is you use the same hands you type those “Per my last email” responses with… to wash themselves.

This isn’t a gym locker room or a gas station off highway.  This is a multi-billion dollar workplace full of espresso machines and biometric badge readers. If we can afford catered lunches and standing desks, we can afford 20 seconds at the sink.

Wash your hands. With soap. Like you mean it.
It’s not just about being clean—it’s about being a functioning member of society.

1m2a34z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2a34z,Trip Report- Vegas on a budget*,"*the budget is based around premium travel cards. I’m a budget traveler trying to use the perks of my Amex Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve before I downgrade next year. This trip was to enjoy those perks without going too far beyond them. I booked on weekdays to save money, as I can work from anywhere, and specifically wanted to go in the heat because I thrive in it and have only been to Vegas in the winter. This was my fifth trip in about eight years, so not an expert but not a newbie either. I chose to switch hotels each night because I want to experience as many as possible, and it increased the credit card benefits. I based the hotel nights on lowest price available, and it worked out that they were in a line and I didn’t need to backtrack on my walks. For perspective, on previous visits I have stayed at Luxor, Hard Rock, Cosmopolitan, Trump (not on purpose, took a priceline gamble), and Bally’s.
 
Flights: Sunday-Wednesday IAD-LAS direct on Frontier, $120 round trip including a personal item and carry on (I’m Discount Den and have gold status, though this was my first time using it as normally I only travel with just a backpack). Breakfast Sunday was at the Dulles Chase/Etihad lounge. Dinner Wednesday was at the LAS Amex Centurion lounge.
 
Transportation: $9 in bus fare airport RT. I walked everywhere else. Instead of a backpack I brought an underseat-sized roller and sling, thinking it would be nicer to walk from hotel to hotel in the heat than a backpack.
 
Night 1: Fontainebleau booked with FHR using Amex points. This got me early check in (my room was ready when I arrived at 10:30am), late checkout at 4pm confirmed at check in, an upgraded room type (I think mostly just the higher floor and view), and $160 in food credit split as $100 anywhere and $60 at specific breakfast spots. These spots overlapped though, so there was a lot of flexibility on where and when to use it. I like to plan ahead and was frustrated at how difficult it was to find menus with prices, so I took photos of everything I walked by and posted them here if it helps anyone: https://imgur.com/a/uiFUwmQ
 
Using the credits I had Day 1 lunch from Roadside Taco, dinner from Miami Slice, Day 2 breakfast from Chez Bon Bon, lunch from El Bagel, and got Day 2 dinner and Day 3 breakfast to go from Roadside Taco and Chez Bon Bon (threw some ice in a bag for my commute to the next hotel and put the next morning’s overnight oats in the ice bucket there).
 
That night I walked to the Sphere to see Backstreet Boys (amazing!!) using the Reserve $150 StubHub credit (this was actually from a friend who just got the card and wasn’t going to use it before July 1, as my card won’t switch to the new benefits until October). I paid $75 for my seat outside of that.
 
Night 2: Venetian booked with Hyatt points for the brand explorer award. This didn’t come with any benefits, hence bringing breakfast with me from the previous hotel. I also packed my own instant coffee, creamer, and sugar and had an iced coffee in the room in my $3 souvenir BSB concert cup. I only have Hyatt Explorist status and know getting anything in Vegas even as a globalist is hard, so I never tried for an upgrade or late check out (in fact did everything electronically and never even spoke to a human there at all). A Hyatt DP I wasn’t expecting though- I registered for the 777 bonus points on casino stays *after* I had booked the hotel, on the off chance it would apply, and it did!
 
Night 3: Bellagio booked with Edit using Chase points. Theoretically all of the same FHR benefits applied, though in reality it was less. I think that’s more of a Bellagio thing than an Edit thing, and had lower expectations going into it. I was able to get into my room at 11:30am, but didn’t get a “real” upgrade (no strip/fountain view available, though they put me in an “enhanced wellness” room that basically just had an air purifier added). They told me to call in the morning for a late checkout, which was only provided til noon. They said they were full, and while I have no idea if this is true midweek in July it did seem like there was an event going on somewhere nearby. The great thing about doing Edit with an MGM property though is that you can use the credits at any of their approved restaurants, which I have put screenshots of here: https://imgur.com/a/RDMAmxt
 
I used my credits to have linner at Din Tai Fung at Aria, dessert at Milk Bar in Cosmopolitan,  breakfast at the buffet at Bellagio (when in Rome!), and lunch from Café Gelato at Bellagio because I was still working and didn’t want to go far. *Edit: after I checked out I saw that the Milk Bar charge coded as retail, which isn’t changeable. Unfortunately no way to know ahead of time, but hopefully they will update the website list.*
 
Overall I think I did a good job keeping costs down (though there were of course resort fees and tips on top of these credits). I spent $5 on Gatorade at CVS while I was out walking, but otherwise drank tap water, and didn’t do much because I was working til 2pm each day. I pretty much just read by the pools and aimlessly walked around outside of that, which was perfect. I guess one walk had a purpose- Saks to get my $50 gift card with Amex credit. For anyone looking for a DP there- no issues; very polite saleswoman.
 
My impressions of the hotels are as follows:
 
Fontainebleau was amazing and I would happily stay there again. Yes, it’s farther way (though close to airport bus stop), but when I read about it being “unwalkable” I was worried that meant it was unsafe, or had no sidewalks. Really people just meant it was a longer walk to get places. I like walking, so this wasn’t a problem, and I found it perfect for a Sphere commute because there are no overpasses to deal with- you can just go straight there and back. I’m also a fast walker, so I got to Palazzo in 15 minutes. If I hadn’t had the food credits I would have walked to the McDonalds across the street for all my meals, because #budget. I loved the room décor and how bright it was, the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve slept in, and the gym was huge and I took a free pilates class. The downside to me was that the pool was chaos (which maybe was a weekend thing), with EDM blasting and kids everywhere. I’m happy for the kids, I was just trying to read and only found the quieter 21+ pool when I was leaving. Also the elevators were very crowded and some people had to wait while full ones passed. But whatever issues people reported on in the past did not affect me, and everyone who worked there was super nice.
 
Venetian- glad I went but probably wouldn’t stay again. There was nothing wrong with it, it’s just an older property and therefore my room décor was all dark brown and the lower light from the window never quite changed that effect. Nothing was worn down and the room was huge, but you could tell its age from the lack of outlets in obvious places (only on one side of bed, for example). The pool area was very relaxing though and there were no crowded elevators. 
 
Bellagio- a bucket list thing for me, and I would stay here again if I got another great points deal. I just think the flowers are the most beautiful thing, and the location is hard to beat. My room category was called “StayWell Premier,” which took up two floors, and the front desk really emphasized that this was, in fact, an upgrade. I’m not someone who needs upgrades and would have been happy anywhere, but because of the emphasis on it I picked it apart a little more than I would have otherwise. I liked the décor and my view of the pool/mountains, but otherwise the perks were a little silly… the hallway somehow smelled like (faint) smoke, and the room a little bit too. I’m smoke sensitive but not perfume sensitive- would have been happy for a scent to be piped in- but the irony of the “healthy” room with a constantly running air purifier being the only place I sneezed and had a runny nose the whole trip was not lost on me! Also there was barely any water pressure in the “special” shower. All of this really wasn’t a big deal though, it was still a lovely stay and I liked this pool area the best. It was relaxing, not crowded, and had hot tubs! It also stayed open til 8, which was later than the others. I had no idea this would be a common theme in Vegas, I would have loved to sit outside later in the evening.
 
The only thing I didn’t get to do was eat In N Out, because I was full and trying to save $. Overall it was a fun trip and I will continue doing ones like this while I have the cards, but also think I can keep Vegas costs low without them by walking/using public transportation and getting creative with packing food/getting food at McDonalds or a drug store.",35,1752764988.0,LasVegas,3,0.93,False

Idk what i should think really, 4 months waiting for a coffee? Does he ignore me? He doesnt want friendship with me? Am I annoying with messages?

Personally, I prefer coffee and the electric guitar, but I'm basically hoping to not have to work, build a studio, occasionally get high, and watch a lot of art house.  35M, neurodivergent, non-binary but bi-curious, if that's relevant.  Eclectic set of interests and potential unsung creative genius if that helps.  Sort of a libertine, but moreso fun than reckless anymore.  High key not a shitpost about being expected to be like Mr. Darcy and low key a genuine advice thread that won't get past the mods on any other advice subreddit.  I'm certainly not banking on any of these notions, but I'm just genuinely curious as to what people would say about all of this.

Basically, I'm looking for someone to become my artistic patron, creative collaborator, muse, and lover.  I imagine this person to be attractive in that John Williams Waterhouse sort of way, to have a graduate arts degree from a hip university, and to be somewhat indifferent to our squandering of their inherited wealth.  It's also a bonus if they have some kind of title.  I'm not sure why, but I like self-stylize myself as a marquis in fiction.  

Obviously, I'm not making any life plans in this regard, but I'm just genuinely curious as to what Reddit would have to say about this.  ",1,1752764906.0,shittyadvice,0,1.0,False

I fight every urge to just roll over and go back to sleep because I’m usually off work on Saturdays but I said I would pick up some hours at work so it’s time to get up.

I begin my morning the same way I have for the past few years. A cup of tea with milk and 3 sugars and toast with plenty of butter. It’s one the few things I look forward to in the morning. A comfort of sorts.
I usually keep the TV on in the morning, keeping the news on to get the weather, be reminded to wash my hands and wear a mask and to see if traffic sucks. I take the bus to work anyway but it helps to be clued in on whether or not I’m going to be late.
Although this morning a can’t get any signal on my TV so I get ready for work in silence.
My mornings are simple. I live alone in a one bedroom flat and have no pets. I don’t have to worry about someone using up all of the hot water before me or someone hogging the bathroom all morning. It’s simple. It’s peaceful. It’s honestly quite lonely.

Grabbing my message bag and fixing my tie, I head outside to go and catch the bus to work. It’s honestly not very far to walk but I’d rather just get the bus. Although, the bus stop is usually busier than this. Maybe it’s because it’s Saturday, I’m never up at this time on my days off so maybe it’s never busy.
It’s only me and two other people. People I commonly see on my usual work days. An older woman sitting with her walking stick and a face like a bulldog eating a wasp. Also a younger man who is always blasting music on his headphones and wears a business attire like me. Shirt and tie with a jacket usually. They’re hard to get conversation out of, which is understandable I suppose. I can get the occasional head nod and an “alright?” out of the woman but the man is unreachable. He just stares at his phone. He doesn’t even thank the bus driver. Knob.

Today it seems, is different.

“Any word on this bus?” The old woman complained loudly just as I sat down on the bus stop bench.

 “Is it running today?” 
She turns to me actually instigating a conversation.

“I think so.” I replied, looking at my watch. “It should be here by now.”

We’re now just looking up and down the street for a missing bus. I don’t see one. What I do notice is the street itself. It’s quiet. Eerily so.
Again, either it’s just Saturday mornings or no one woke up this morning. The street is a two way road with both sides lined with terraced houses, a few blocks of flats and some shop fronts. It’s usually busy, even this early in the morning. As well as it being a warm spring morning, people should be out and about.
It’s starting to unnerve me. No sounds of cars, no kids out playing, no people shouting something about wheelie bins, (I swear that’s like every morning) nothing.

“Fuck sake!” 
The man finally spoke. He removes his headphones and turns his phone screen showing the bus timetable page toward me and the old woman.

“All the buses are cancelled today. They’re not running at all! Something about all the bus drivers being sick.”

I’m not too upset about this, what with work only being about a half an hour walk away, but this news was devastating to the old woman.
She stands up, gripping her stick all the might of a scorned pensioner.

“Fuckin’ useless bastards!” 
She gowls. 

“Nothin’ ever works properly these days!” 
She begins to walk into the warm morning haze muttering and swearing under her breath.

The man begins rapidly searching his phone, maybe to find more information on the bus situation or more likely to contact someone who can give him a lift. He pauses and looks at me. 

“Do you work far from here?”

“No, not really. It’s just a bit of a walk. I’ll probably start heading on now.” 

I answered, standing up and putting my message bag back over my shoulder.
The man looks defeated. He angrily shoved his phone in his pocket and lets out an exasperated sigh. He looks at me with tired eyes.

“I’m supposed to be off today. But everyone at work is bloody sick. That new flu or bug or whatever the fuck.”

Look at that. Similar circumstances.

“Same, mate. I have to go in and make sure shite gets photocopied. That’s it. Waste of my Saturday honestly.” 

I chuckled. 
“Yeah, man, I have to finish a couple of people’s reports that didn’t get done this week. I swear I just get landed with everyone’s work.”

He puts his headphones back over his head and starts walking up the street. We exchange a wave and go our separate ways. I guess he isn’t too much of a knob after all. Well, he still doesn’t thank the bus driver.


On my way to work I notice that streets are all the same vibe. No people.
But now there seems to be signs of life. Tipped over bins, cars not exactly parked but more abandoned in the street. There’s the occasional other commuter that you pass by with a quiet “hey, ya.” but rarely get a response. 
At this point the morning was starting to warm up. With the weather in this country being 99% pissing rain and freezing cold, I don’t like to complain about the heat when we get it.
That being said, I was staring to sweat a bit and decided to dip into a nearby newsagent’s.
Business as usual in here. 
It’s an old corner shop that hasn’t updated anything since the 80’s and maybe earlier. There’s still a faded sign on the wall that advertises the ‘new’ drink called ‘Lilt’. I’m pretty sure that was a 70’s thing.
Same old guy at the counter. Sitting there reading a fishing magazine and occasionally doing a singular loud cough. He’s usually reading that morning’s paper but there doesn’t seem to be any on the shelf. I guess the paper delivery guys are sick too.
My mission here is simple. Drinks. Something cold. Something refreshing. I’ve been sweating more than I realised.
I walk up the aisle and pass the large selection of 30p energy drinks and knock off brands. Why have a can of Monster when you could have Beast energy? 
I grab a bottle of water and on the way back towards the counter I grab a Kinder Bueno for later. Treat yourself.
I stand at the the till for about thirty seconds before the cashier puts down his newspaper and gets out of his chair. I can hear his knees cracking above the sound of his wireless radio which sounds like the news. I try to listen just in case there’s anything about why outside is like an episode of The Twilight Zone but the cashier’s coughing drowns it out.

“Just them, aye?.” 

He asks wearily.
I confirm and get my wallet out of my pocket.

“Four pound, there, mate.” 

He says while thumping the till to open the drawer.
No scanning necessary. Old school.
I pay for my things and turn towards the door. Just as I’m leaving the shop, the sound of the door buzzer is immediately cancelled out by a swarm of police cars and riot vans speeding past with their sirens blaring. Not an uncommon sight around here but they had army trucks too. 
Maybe something IS happening this morning. Or maybe it’s coincidence.
As I step away from the shop, one half of my Kinder Bueno bar is immediately consumed. It was never for later.

As 8 o’clock rolls up I enter the office building. I’ve been working here for nearly three years and I still don’t 100% know what we do here. I usually just sit in my cubicle and people send me excel pages with numbers on them and all I have to do is add all the numbers together and send them back. I have no idea what these numbers mean but somehow I still made employee of the month on a few occasions.
My job today is simple; photocopy some of those excel pages hand them off to Derrick. There’s quite a lot of people off sick today so I’ll need to do a bunch of photocopying. I hate that we can’t just email this stuff but the boss says we need hard copies of EVERYTHING. The boss is a cretinous piece of shit called Lesley. He acts like our office is his own ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ simulator and he’s absolutely insufferable. He only talks about himself and all of his weekend escapades like golfing and his new BMW. Sure, Lesley, Kathy in the cubicle next to me works two jobs and still has to use a food bank to feed her kids and most of the work computers still use CRT monitors but you do you, king.

The office is damn near silent aside from the occasional unanswered phone ringing in the background. I sit down at my cubicle and gather the pages I need. I print off a few more pages and get them stapled. At this rate I’ll be home in no time.
On my way to the photocopying room I can hear a murmur of people and the clanging of spoons on tea cups in the break room. I poked my head in to the break room to see who was in today.
Sitting around the table was Samantha, Kathy, Lewis, Megan and Ben. No Derrick. Shit.
Well I guess I’ll just leave everything on his desk when I’m finished. Derrick is the one who sends the folders… somewhere. 
Again, I have no idea what we do here at ‘Robinson Ltd’.

“Oh. Morning, Andrew!”

Kathy’s greeting was always nice. Like I mentioned before, she works two jobs and has a couple of kids that she raises alone. Although I’m sure she’s always tired and having a rough time, she’s always chipper, friendly and eager to brighten your day. When I started this job, she was the person who helped me get settled and was always there to help me when I needed it. 

“I didn’t realise you were in this morning.” 

She continued.

“Yeah, just some photocopying to do and I can call it a day.” 

I answered.
Samantha lifted her head from the table and exhaled a lung full of vape cloud.

“Nice for some!” 

She snapped.

 “I got phoned last night while I was in the pub. I’m fuckin’ dying this morning and I won’t be home til four o’clock.” 

Her eyes were bloodshot. Her blonde hair a mess and cradling a cup of coffee like her life depended on it. Samantha was pretty young. Probably around 21 or 22. Out nearly every night of the week. Don’t know how she affords it. Despite her small stature, she’s known to throw hands with everyone from other pub patrons to the six foot tall, ex army bouncers outside.
Megan looked up from her phone and asked the group;

“Can anyone get signal? I can’t even get 5g.”

Sure enough, no one had signal. The Wi-Fi wasn’t even working. Odd. I guess YouTube videos are off of today’s entertainment. I’m just printing stuff off today anyway so I’m not too bothered.
Megan and Samantha however, were standing on the break room chairs next to the window trying in vain to get signal.
Lewis and Ben were two younger guys. A bit older than Samantha and Megan. Probably late twenties, closer to my age. Which was nice because we talked about video games and movies sometimes.
They were already on their way to the TV that sat in the corner of the break room. 
As the TV came on, the atmosphere completely changed. Everyone grew silent at what we were seeing on the TV.
We couldn’t believe it.

(End of part 1)


We all thought the TV was showing us a horror movie.
Pandemonium. Riots in the streets. Soldiers opening fire on civilians. People running for their lives but towards the soldiers who were gunning them down. 
What the fuck is this? What did I miss? I figured something was wrong this morning when I tried to catch a non existent bus. I guess this is why all this police cars and riot vans were speeding past.
We all just stared at the carnage unfolding on the TV. The camera crews couldn’t even get a clear view of what was happening. They were being pushed back by soldiers and police telling them to get back and the occasional voice telling them to “run”.
After a few minutes of this televised anarchy, the feed cut out. It returned to a news room where everyone seemed panicked. Then, came a chilling speech from the disheveled news broadcaster.

“Uh… folks, we’re getting reports that all over the UK that, uh… how do I even…”

He paused and covered his mouth. Clearly holding back some emotion. The broadcaster next to him was obviously distraught. Her mascara was streaming down her face dripping onto her neat tan blazer. 
He continued.

“The government is warning everyone to stay inside. Do not leave your homes for any reason. Lock your doors and windows. Keep the TV on or have a radio on hand for further instructions.”

There’s no way this is real. I’ve seen enough movies and played enough games to know what this is but… it couldn’t be. It just couldn’t be what I thought it was. I had to keep my hypothesis to myself. Otherwise everyone would think I’m mental.

“Fuckin’ zombies, man!” 

Ben exclaimed as he turned from the TV.
I guess I’m not the only one that thought it.

“Fuck up, you!” 

Megan shouted while throwing a spoon at him.

“Zombies!? Are you serious!? How is it zombies, you dick!?” 

Megan always had a way with words.
Lewis jumped in to defend Ben.

“How is it not? Folk running away from people that are trying to climb over the top of you and soldiers just shooting everyone in a panic.”

I must of missed that on TV. People climbing over each other?

“I didn’t see that. Are you sure?” 

I asked.
Ben pointed at the TV

“Aye! Did you not see it? Folk were grabbing ones and pulling them to the ground. It’s zombies, man. I’m telling you!”

I was almost ashamed to be convinced by this. I think I wanted to be. A zombie apocalypse was happening outside and I didn’t know what to think. I looked for Kathy to see what she was making of this whole situation. She was in the corner of the room, tears streaming down her face and trying to get through to someone on her phone but being continuously met by an ‘no service’ tone. 
We locked eyes. She saw my concern.

“My girls. They’re at their child minders today.”

Her trembling hand raised to cover her mouth. 

“I’m sorry, I… I have to…”

Before she could finish her sentence, she grabbed her bag and ran out of the room and out of the building.
I could’ve asked for a lift home I suppose but she seemed to be preoccupied. I don’t really have any plans though. I don’t have anyone to check on. No family. No friends. I thought I would kick into gear like the movies. Telling everyone my big elaborate plan to get everyone to safety and survive this thing. I guess everyone has ideas like that. To be the hero. To be the one who saves the day and looks badass while doing it. 
It reminded me why I’m here. At this non descriptive office building. At this shit job working for an absolute prick, barely making enough money to cover rent on a one bedroom flat. I could have been my own hero. But instead, I landed myself in heaping pile of misery and mediocrity.
Just before I could get myself into a full blown existential crisis; sprinting back through the door of the building, screaming the whole way was Kathy. Before she made it as far as the break room, following close behind, stumbling through the open door, was exactly what we feared.
It was awful. A visibly decomposing man. He had an expressionless look on his face and eyes as white as milk. His skin was blotchy and cracked. It was near peeling off in some places. I couldn’t believe it. It was an actual member of the undead hoard. A zombie.

As Kathy came crashing into the break room she started pointing at the zombie out in the hall, trying her best to say something amid her frantic crying. We all got up to see this macabre entity shambling through our workplace. It looked up at us, all just standing in the door way of the break room, staring at it. The rational part of me wanted to see what we were dealing with. If it really was a walking cadaver, I wanted to see what kind it was. Was it a Romero zombie or a Snyder zombie?
I got my answer.
Its face went from a blank expression to one of pure rage. It let out a raspy gargled scream and began running toward us.
You’ve got to be fucking joking. They run. They fucking run!
Not a full sprint but just faster than a jog. 
Lewis shoved past everyone wielding a large knife from one of the kitchen drawers. With one powerful motion he plunged the knife into the top of the zombie’s head. 
Just like that, it slumped over and lay there, pouring blood onto the pale orange carpet. As we all just stared at the body, Lewis had already gone over and closed the front door and was starting to barricade it with nearby tables and chairs.
I was so stunned about what I just saw that I just stood there.
This is what we needed. Someone to immediately take charge and get be the hero to get us through this. Cause it sure as shit wasn’t going to be me. 
As I stood there, Lewis and Ben began barricading all the doors leading outside. Megan was helping too and Samantha was complaining that everything was too heavy for her to lift. I wanted to help, but I could only focus on Kathy. She was on the floor of the break room. Quietly sobbing. I don’t blame her. She has kids out there. Family that she has to help. She needs to be a mother. Her children need her. But she’s stuck. Stuck in here with this skeleton crew of a workforce that was in the process of locking everything down.
I didn’t like the idea of staying here. I hated the place on normal days and now it was going to be a prison. Keeping me here until help arrives, (which is unlikely) or until the undead break in and tear into me like a spoiled kid playing pass the parcel and the music just stopped.
Lewis and Ben looked like they had been ready for this for a long time. They jumped into action so fast it was as if they had practised this a hundred times. They were barking orders at Megan and Samantha like they were commanding troops while I was waiting for someone to shout my name and issue me something to do but thankfully no such order came.

We were holed up in the office for about three hours at this point. The TV wasn’t issuing any instructions and the radio was just static. We were on our own by the looks of it. There would be the occasional sound outside, breaking up the silence. Screaming. Cars speeding past. 
The rare gunshot or explosion. 
I was walking the halls of the office for a while when I heard some metal clicking noises coming from one of the doors. I peeked around the corner to see Kathy, trying to pick the lock of the boss’ office.

“What are you doing. What are expecting to find in there?” 

I asked.
Kathy just nodded her head towards the window. I looked outside at the rear car park. Sitting there was Lesley’s BMW.

“If his car is here, his keys should be in here. And that thing is probably a lot faster than my car.” 

Kathy muttered, not looking up from the lock.

“Besides.” 

She continued. 

“Mine is surrounded by those bastards.”

It was a decent plan I suppose. It was the only one involving actually leaving this place. And honestly I was sick of listening to Samantha complaining about everything.

“Are you able to pick it?” I asked

“No, I’m just doing what I see on TV. You just a hair pin and wiggle it, right?”

“Not exactly.” I chuckled.

“Well, what do think we should do?”

This was my moment. 

“Stand back.” 

I stood firmly and with all my might, delivered a Sparta kick to the edge of the door and to my surprise, it came right off its hinges.
It probably made me look cool but honestly my ankle just real hurts now.

“Wow, look at you! All big and tough.” Kathy smiled.

I felt proud of my ‘manly’ accomplishment. It felt like when you were at school and the teacher asked if there was ‘a big strong boy to put all the chairs away’ and you would lift the whole stack of chairs. A god among mortals.

Kathy and I entered the room. Surprisingly, no one seemed to hear the sound of a door being kicked off its hinges just down the hall. I had never been in Lesley’s office. It’s exactly how I imagined it. Fake wood panelling with cheap fake gold trim along the walls. An antique spinning globe, undoubtedly full of alcohol. There was a large leather reading chair in the corner.
I pointed at it.
“I figured Lesley would have a cuck chair.”
“A what?”
“Nothin’”
We go back to searching the office.
Kathy rushes over to the desk and snatches a set of keys just sitting next to a computer monitor.
“Yes! Got them!” Kathy exclaimed

“Wait a minute. If his keys are here and his keys are here… where is he?” I asked.

“Don’t care. I’m getting out of here.” 

Kathy walked out the office with a spring in her step. I was more concerned with what else was in here. A few book shelves. Boring. A few framed photographs. Meh. Top drawer of the desk. Stationary. Pens, paper and post-it notes. Closing the drawer, I was about to give up hope on finding anything of use in the office. Until I opened the bottom drawer. 
You have got to be fucking joking me. No way.
Inside the drawer was a Browning Hi-power 9mm pistol. Of course Lesley has a gun. And in the UK a VERY illegal gun. Handguns are completely banned. Lesley really thought he was some big player, didn’t he? He was convinced he was some sort of Tony Montana type character with all this money and power. Fucking loser.
I pick up the gun and check the magazine. Full mag. I click the safety on and put it in my waist band. To be honest, I’m a bit of a ‘firearm enthusiast’. I know the four rules of gun safety and I’ve played enough video games to know how this model works.
I think I’ll keep this to myself. I’m not having every one arguing about who gets the gun. None of them would know how to use it safely and I’m not dying in a zombie apocalypse because some idiot didn’t keep their finger off the trigger and kept flagging me. 

Catching up to Kathy, I help her move a table out of the way of the rear door.

“Where are YOU going?”
It was Samantha. I knew I smelled a haze of blueberry vape cloud.
Before I could say anything, Kathy answered.

“I need to get out of here! I’m not staying with you lot. I have kids and they need me!” 

I was expecting protest but my to my surprise, Samantha asked to come with us.

“I don’t want to stay here either. Lewis and Ben are acting like wankers and I want to go home to my dog. I want to make sure he’s okay.”

I couldn’t fault her. As much as I wasn’t really fond of her, it was nice that we were forming some sort of team. 
We cleared the path to the door and cautiously walked outside. 
Kathy wasted no time and ran towards the car. As she was figuring out how to unlock it, Samantha and I were slowly walking towards the car. 
That sound again. A pained howling scream. We turned around and saw a small group of zombies. About five or six. Samantha and I turned around to get into the car but as we did, the car roared to life and pulled out the parking space. Before we could even attempt to get in, the car sped away and out of the car park. Kathy was gone.
As she was speeding away, Samantha chased after her, throwing her vape at the car.

“Come back! Don’t you dare, you fucking bitch!”

It was too late. The undead horde was already half way across the car park and picking up speed. I just legged it and told Samantha to follow me.
We ran for what felt like hours. Every street had more and more undead and we had to change direction constantly. I was completely gassed and gasping for air. I had never ran like this before. 
Eventually we came across a familiar sight. The newsagents I visited earlier that day.
We sprinted into the shop, shoving open the door and pushing it closed as fast as we could. The two of us worked like clockwork to get in and pull some shelves in front of the door.
We waited for a few minutes. To catch our breath and to asses the situation. It seemed quiet. There weren’t any signs of the walking corpses outside. But at least we we’re safe.
For now at least.

(End of part 2)

Samantha and I sat there in front of the shop counter for a while. It must have been a few hours because the sun was beginning to set. We didn’t have a plan. As far as we knew, outside was instant death. 
I genuinely wondered why I was in this situation. I didn’t want the office to be my tomb but at the same time, I felt bad for just leaving Lewis, Ben and Megan without saying anything. I felt like I was just along for the ride. I didn’t have my own plan or people to meet up with. Everyone else did. Kathy had her two daughters to save. As much as Samantha and I disagreed with her methods. And Samantha, she had a dog. It’s not much in the grand scheme of things but pets are still family. I got curious.

“What type of dog is it?” I asked.

“What?”

“Your dog. The one you have at home. What breed is it?”

“Oh. It’s uh… it’s a weird mix. I don’t even think the breed has a name. He looks like a weird German shepherd but smaller.”

“What’s his name?”

“His name’s Fred. I’m sure he’s freaking out right now. I was supposed to be home ages ago.”

Well… it was an objective. Not quite as noble as saving some kids but it was still something to strive for.
We eventually got hungry started to snack on some of the food around the shop. There was no sign of the old guy that ran the place so it was open season on the bags of crisps. Of course Samantha asked if the shop sold vapes and I pointed her towards the back wall behind the counter. On her way around, she slipped on something and had to grab the nearby shelf to stop herself from falling. She looked down to see what caused the slip. She went pale.

“Andrew!” 

Her tone sounded like when an arachnophobe sees a spider in the bath.
I jump to my feet and took a look around the counter.
On the floor was a large pool of smeared blood.

The blood trailed off to the back of the shop. I began to follow it while Samantha was hunched over trying not to vomit.
I slowly followed the blood trail along the length of the shop. The further it went I felt myself starting to panic. I didn’t consider what could be at the end of this trail, and the thought of every possibility began to scare me. What would I find? There was only one to find out.
The trail ended. It went underneath a door labelled ‘employees only’.
The door was slightly ajar and with every fibre of my being telling me not to proceed, I put my hand to the blood stained door and gently pushed it open.
In the middle of the musty employee bathroom, standing with his back to me was the old man.
He was stood there facing the wall with his head lowered. He was covered in blood from a large wound on his neck.
I froze. I didn’t know what to do. 
The old man began to slowly turn around. Eventually we were both stood there looking at each other. His eyes were enveloped in the same cloudy white colour as the others. As he raised his head and began to make that guttural scream that made my blood run cold, I reached into my waistband and raised the gun I took from Lesley’s office.
I clicked off the safety and with the loudest crack I’d ever heard in my life, the old man’s grey matter painted the rear bathroom wall.
I had never seen anyone slump over like that before. He didn’t fly back dramatically like you see in the movies. It was like a switch got flipped and he just shut down. Straight down to the ground.
My ears were ringing. It took a while for me to able to hear Samantha standing at the bathroom door behind me freaking out.
Eventually I could hear her swearing at me about the gun and not giving her a warning about the loud bang.

“What the fuck, Andrew!? Do you just carry a gun with you to work!?”

“No! No I…” 
She wouldn’t let me finish.

“That’s so weird, man! Where did you even get that!?”

“Lesley’s office! It was in his desk!”

She took a second.

“Of course that knob had a fucking gun!” 
She added.
 “Who was that? The owner?”

I closed the bathroom door and put the pistol back in my waistband. It felt a bit better not having to hide it anymore.

“Yeah. I think he owned the place. He sold me some stuff this morning. Didn’t think I would end up shooting him. Didn’t think I would end up killing anyone… ever. Zombies… holy shit this is insane.”

I take a moment to calm myself down. 

After standing there for a bit and talking about how much we hated working for Lesley. We were eventually silenced by the sound buzzing. Loud buzzing. Actually, very loud. I head towards the rear door of the shop, open it and looked out side. The sky was full of helicopters. They were heading back and forth from somewhere in the distance. It didn’t look too far away. Whatever it was, it was important. It was a large distant glow, further illuminated by floodlights from the ground and the helicopter spotlights. Then a voice echoed across the sky. 

“To anyone who can hear this, make your way to Patton memorial park. The government has set up an emergency shelter and hospital.” 
It began to repeat a few times.

A switch went off in my brain. I had a plan. And for once in my life it wasn’t someone else’s plan. I wanted to survive.
I turned to Samantha.

“Listen, I know you want to get home to Fred, but I’m going to that shelter. You can come with me if you want but I won’t force you if you don’t want to.”

“Who’s Fred?” She asked, confused.
I just looked at her.

“Your dog?”

She looked flustered and began fidgeting.

“Look, I’m gonna be honest. I don’t have a dog. I figured I needed some excuse to go with you and Kathy. She had kids and I assumed you had family or something so I panicked and said I had a dog. I get it if you’re a bit pissed off with me but if you’re going to that army place or whatever I want to go too.”

Honestly I would have been annoyed if it didn’t make this whole thing a lot easier. We had a goal. One that was visible over the tops of the houses and back alleys in front of us. 
We grabbed some supplies from shop first. Flashlights, batteries, water, vapes and a cheeky energy drink. 
We braced ourselves and left through the back door of the shop. 
I grabbed the pistol from my waistband and readied myself for the task ahead.
I have never been this determined about anything in my life.
We were getting to that fucking stadium!

(End of part 3)


The alleys seemed to go on forever. Moving through people’s gardens and hopping every fence and wall. I wasn’t risking any deviation from the path. Move straight towards the flood lights.

This was taking a while and before we knew it, night had fallen. Even though we had flashlights, the sounds emitting from the darkness were nightmare fuel. Screaming, car alarms, babies crying, dogs barking, gun shots and those awful sounds the zombies made when they were nearby made it hard to keep moving. It felt like at any second, something would emerge from the darkness and grab you. 
I occasionally checked on Samantha behind me who had worked her way through nearly two whole vapes to try and calm her nerves.
Every time I checked on her I just tried to reassure her and told her that we were nearly there.

I was scared. I didn’t want to admit it but I was absolutely terrified. I felt like my every step in the dark would be my last. I just focused on the distant flood lights kept moving. As long as we could make it there, this nightmare would be over.

As we hopped the last fence we realised we were in an open street. The power must have went out because the street lights weren’t on. It was pitch black.
We raised our flashlights into the street.
The light revealed a plethora of dark shadowy figures, All huddled in the street and shambling around.
We quickly turned off our lights. The street was full of zombies. We needed across the street and through the gate on the other side that led to more alleys.
It was about thirty feet or so but it felt like an entire shark infested ocean.
I wasn’t sure where exactly we need to go so I raised my light and switched in on.
I caught a glimpse of the gate and switched my light back off.
Samantha tapped me on the shoulder.

“Fucking stop.” She whispered. 
“They’ll see you.”

I paused for a moment. Wait a minute. They should have seen me. It was a bright light in a dark street.
My curiosity got the better of me.
I raised my light once more and switched it on.
I shined my light right at the hoard of undead. Nothing. They didn’t react. They just stood there.
That was it! Their eyes! The completely white eyes. They were blind. Or at least, they had really bad low light vision. 
We kept our lights on and slowly made our way towards the gate. 
With a sigh of relief, we reached the gate. I put my hand on the gates latch and realised the whole gate was covered in rust.
I push the gate slightly and it began to squeak. I stopped.
The hoard behind us began making sounds. The only way I describe these sounds is like a caveman who heard a sabre-tooth tiger nearby. Sort of alerted grunts.
I realised this was going to be bad.
I turned to Samantha.

“When this gate opens, you run like fuck and don’t stop, okay?”

She was trembling. She looked at me then zombies then back to me.

“Alright.”

“On the count of three. One. Two. Three!”

I pushed the gate open and it emitted the loudest, ear splitting squeal. On our way through, I heard that awful roar from the hoard behind us. We just kept running. Leaping every fence and wall in our path being chased by the sounds of the undead following close behind, knocking over everything as they went.
I was getting tired. I noticed Samantha was in front of me at this point. I was beginning to think I wouldn’t make it out of this alley.
My fear was realised. A wall. Too tall to scale alone.
Without thinking I crouched down and grabbed Samantha’s foot as she tried to climb. With all the strength I could muster, I pushed her up until she could reach the top of the wall. She grabbed the edge and pulled herself over. I didn’t realise the situation I had left myself in. Samantha was on the other side screaming my name and I couldn’t answer. I needed to think. I needed space. I turned toward the advancing hoard of death and raised my pistol.
Every pull of the trigger brought with it a flash of light and a crash of thunder. Each shot deafening me and illuminating the approaching horror in front of me. The faces. The eyes. The snarling blood stained mouths. The flashes were so fast it was like a slideshow showing me my own death rushing towards me. 
I lost count of the shots because suddenly the gun only clicked and I stood in darkness once more. I knew I wasn’t free of this hell because I could still hear footsteps getting louder from the alley ahead.
Seeing no other option, I threw the empty gun towards the darkness and turned towards the wall. I set my sights on a nearby wheelie bin next to the wall and set off towards it a full sprint. I jumped up onto a small brick wall belonging to one of the back gardens that lined the alley. From the small garden wall I hopped on to the top of the bin and jumped as high as I could. I reach out for the edge of the wall and with a last desperate attempt at survival I grab the edge and pull I myself up. As I reached the top of the wall I see Samantha on the other side who starts screaming my name like she hasn’t seen me in years. 
At this point, all the energy I had was gone and I slowly fall over the wall. Any attempt I could have made at saving myself was gone. I hit the ground in front of Samantha and all the air leaves my lungs as I crash into the pavement below. Samantha begins helping me up because the chase isn’t over. I look up to see several hands grabbing the top of the wall. I don’t want to see the abominations following after so I do my best to pick myself up and continue running.
We make our way to a wide empty street. The glow of the stadium is blinding. It’s right there. So close. But even closer are the sounds of ravenous running corpses behind us. 
The lights. The stadium. They’re right there. Hell approaches from behind while Heaven sits just out of reach. I can make it. We can make it. 
As I prepare to feel hands grabbing me and teeth tearing into me, a large set of flood lights ahead of us light up the entire street and a voice erupts from the heavenly glow.

“Hit the deck! Now!”

Samantha, still trying to hold me up from my fall throws me to the ground and dives nearly on top of me.
The thunderous sound of a .50 calibre machine gun violently interrupts the sounds of footsteps and growls of the approaching hoard behind us.
As the bullets whistle past overhead, the hoard are stopped in their tracks and are torn apart like piñatas full of meat. Flesh and viscera litter the street and the hellish growls and moans are no more.

“Get up slowly and keep your hands where we can see them!”

The voice was stern and commanding, but it was the most comforting thing I’d heard all day.
Samantha and I manage to get to our feet. Following the instructions given to us, we walked forwards slowly with our hands raised until we reached the gate.
At this point I’m ready to pass out. Coming down from that much adrenaline doesn’t feel the best.
Everything is a blur. We get brought into a bunch of different rooms and people in hazmat suits administer a lot of tests, draw blood, look at our eyes, check our tongues and eventually let us into the next area. 
The main football pitch of the stadium was now full of tents and temporary buildings. Soldiers and military vehicles surrounded the place. We wait in line with a bowl to get some soup with a few hundred other people. Other people who probably survived a very similar nightmare. Honestly, probably a worse one. I get to the front of the queue and a man in fatigues and a beret serves me up some vegetable soup. It’s like being back in school. I look for a place to sit and notice Samantha already sitting at a table. It was one of those metal picnic tables. Like the ones you see in prison movies. As I sit down with my bowl in front of Samantha, I sort of come back to my senses. 
Samantha and I look at each other. I think we were exhausted because all we could do was laugh. It was somber. The laughter ended and we sat with teary eyes, just being grateful that we were alive. We had survived a nightmare which we would probably relive every time we slept. I’ll be seeing those faces in the darkness for a very long time.
I take a moment to gather myself. Taking in the camp made up around us. Although something catches my eye.
In a nearby tent, sitting on a cot and wrapped in a blanket was Kathy.
In her arms was a small child. About six or seven years old. They were both in rough shape and the girl was bawling her eyes out.
We lock eyes for a second. They seemed glazed over. Red and puffy from weeping. I want to give her shit for leaving us to fend for ourselves, but honestly she looks like she had a worse time. Besides, I can’t see her other girl anywhere.
Instead I set my eyes back to my bowl of soup. I lift my spoon and take a mouthful. Compared to the toast I had for breakfast, the chocolate bar and many crisps from the shop…
This was the best thing I ate all day.

## Key Features Analysis

Gray cream rugs, like any home furnishing, offer a variety of features that influence their durability, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. Examining these technical specifications can help you make an informed decision when selecting the perfect rug for your space.

**Material Composition:** The material of a gray cream rug is a crucial factor determining its durability, texture, and maintenance requirements.Common materials include wool,synthetic fibers like polypropylene and polyester,and blends of natural and synthetic materials. Wool rugs are known for their luxurious feel, longevity, and natural stain resistance.Synthetic rugs, conversely, are typically more affordable, easy to clean, and resistant to fading and mildew. The best material for your rug will depend on your budget, lifestyle, and the level of foot traffic in the area where the rug will be placed.

**Pile Height & Construction:** Pile height refers to the length of the fibers that make up the rug's surface. High-pile rugs, frequently enough referred to as shag rugs, offer a plush and comfortable feel underfoot, making them ideal for low-traffic areas like bedrooms and living rooms.Low-pile rugs, conversely, are more durable and easier to clean, making them suitable for high-traffic areas like hallways and entryways. Rug construction methods vary, including hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave.hand-knotted rugs are the most labor-intensive and expensive, known for their intricate designs and exceptional durability. Machine-made rugs are the most affordable and readily available, offering a wide range of styles and patterns.

**Size & Shape Options:** Gray cream rugs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes to accommodate different room dimensions and layouts. Common sizes include small area rugs (2x3 feet), medium area rugs (5x7 feet), large area rugs (8x10 feet), and runners. Shape options include rectangular, square, round, and oval rugs. Selecting the right size and shape is essential for creating a balanced and harmonious look in your space. A rug that is too small can make a room feel disjointed, while a rug that is too large can overwhelm the space.Generally, a rug should be large enough to anchor the furniture in a room, with at least the front legs of sofas and chairs resting on the rug.

**Pattern & Design Variations:** Gray cream rugs offer a wide range of pattern and design variations, from subtle textures and geometric patterns to intricate floral motifs and abstract designs. A subtle, tone-on-tone pattern can add visual interest without overwhelming the space, while a bold pattern can serve as a focal point in the room.Consider the existing décor and color palette of your space when choosing a pattern for your gray cream rug. A rug with complementary colors and patterns can tie the room together and create a cohesive look. conversely, a rug with contrasting colors and patterns can add a pop of excitement and personality to your space.

**Stain Resistance & Cleanability:** The stain resistance and cleanability of a gray cream rug are vital considerations,especially for households with children and pets. Some rugs are treated with stain-resistant coatings that help repel spills and prevent stains from setting in. Synthetic rugs are generally more stain-resistant than natural fiber rugs, although wool rugs do offer some natural stain resistance due to their lanolin content. Consider the cleaning requirements of the rug before making a purchase. Some rugs can be easily spot-cleaned with mild soap and water, while others may require professional cleaning.**Backing Material & Floor Protection:** The backing material of a gray cream rug provides stability and prevents slippage. Common backing materials include jute, cotton, and synthetic latex.Jute backings are natural and eco-kind,but they can be prone to shedding. Latex backings offer good grip and durability, but they may not be suitable for people with latex allergies. Consider using a rug pad underneath your gray cream rug to provide additional cushioning, prevent slippage, and protect your flooring from scratches and wear.

## Core Benefits

Owning a gray cream rug extends beyond just aesthetics. These rugs offer a multitude of practical benefits that enhance comfort, style, and functionality in your home.

**Enhanced comfort & Warmth:** One of the primary benefits of a gray cream rug is the added comfort and warmth it brings to a room. The plush fibers of a rug can soften hard flooring surfaces like tile or hardwood, making your home feel more inviting and comfortable underfoot. In colder climates,a rug can also help insulate your floors,reducing heat loss and lowering energy bills. Imagine stepping out of bed onto a soft, warm rug on a chilly morning – a simple pleasure that can substantially improve your comfort level.**Improved Acoustics & Noise Reduction:** In addition to providing physical comfort, a gray cream rug can also improve the acoustics of a room. Rugs absorb sound waves, reducing echo and reverberation. This can be particularly beneficial in rooms with high ceilings or hard surfaces,which tend to amplify sound. by dampening noise levels,a rug can create a more peaceful and relaxing atmosphere in your home. Think of how much quieter a room feels with a large area rug compared to a bare floor – the difference can be meaningful, especially in apartments or multi-story homes.**Defined Spaces & Anchoring Décor:** Gray cream rugs are excellent tools for defining spaces and anchoring décor in a room. Whether you're creating a cozy seating area in a living room or defining a dining space in an open-concept layout, a rug can visually delineate different zones within a larger space. by placing furniture strategically on and around the rug, you can create a cohesive and inviting arrangement. A rug acts as a visual anchor, tying together the various elements of your décor and creating a sense of balance and harmony.

**Versatile Style & Aesthetic Appeal:** The versatility of the gray cream color palette is a major benefit. These rugs can blend seamlessly with a wide range of interior design styles, from modern and minimalist to traditional and bohemian. The neutral tones of gray and cream create a calming and sophisticated backdrop for your furniture and accessories,allowing you to experiment with different colors and textures without overwhelming the space.Whether you're looking to create a serene and understated ambiance or a bold and eclectic look, a gray cream rug can adapt to your personal style.

**Protection of Flooring & Prevention of wear:** A rug not only enhances the aesthetics and comfort of your home but also protects your flooring from damage. High-traffic areas are particularly susceptible to wear and tear, including scratches, dents, and fading. By placing a rug in these areas, you can shield your flooring from the daily wear and tear, extending its lifespan and maintaining its beauty. This is especially critically important for expensive flooring materials like hardwood or tile. A good rug pad underneath the rug further enhances this protection by preventing slippage and distributing weight evenly.

## FAQs Section

Understanding common questions about rug selection can clarify the best choice for your lifestyle.

**How do I determine the right size rug for my living room?**
To determine the right size rug for your living room, measure the dimensions of your seating area. Ideally, the rug should be large enough to accommodate all of the furniture in the seating area, with at least the front legs of sofas and chairs resting on the rug.If you have a smaller living room, you can opt for a rug that is large enough to fit under the coffee table and the front legs of the sofa and chairs. Leaving a border of exposed flooring around the perimeter of the room helps to create a sense of spaciousness.

**What is the best way to clean a gray cream rug?**
The best way to clean a gray cream rug depends on the material and construction of the rug. For synthetic rugs, you can typically spot-clean spills with mild soap and water.

Low-pile rugs made from durable synthetic materials like polypropylene or polyester are generally the best choice for high-traffic areas,as they are easy to clean and resistant to wear and tear.

Mods won’t let me talk about the interest that’s not tall, but you can do your research



TL;DR – Krispy Kreme ($DNUT) Thesis

Krispy Kreme is massively undervalued (~$3/share, 0.3× sales) and heavily sold (~30% float short), but the business is far from broken. It’s quietly expanding globally through a hub-and-spoke model that delivers fresh donuts daily to retail partners like Walmart, gas stations, and international franchises.
	•	Revenue is steady (~$1.7B), and 2024 was the first profitable year in a while.
	•	They’re no longer overbuilding stores—instead, they’re scaling through partnerships and franchisees.
	•	The McDonald’s rollout ended, but the infrastructure remains and can serve other partners.
	•	Cash flow turned positive, debt was refinanced, and the company is focusing on high-margin growth.


Bottom line: The brand is strong, the strategy is smarter, and the stock is priced like it’s going out of business — which it’s not. Classic turnaround. Classic American business (over 100 years old).



In depth DD

Placing a long-term bet on Krispy Kreme ($DNUT). The stock is down ~88% from its IPO peak but the company isn’t anywhere near dead – in fact, it’s quietly expanding everywhere. I travel a lot, and I’ve seen Krispy Kreme doughnuts from Texas to Tokyo, and even at gas stations in South Africa (thanks to partnerships with local fuel chains) ￼ ￼. For those who actually care to read, here’s why I think this glazed underdog could pull a $OPEN like comeback, (still in progress) backed up with facts:

	•	Not Bankrupt – Just Baking a Comeback: Krispy Kreme’s stock tanked, but the business itself is far from broken. They did $1.7 billion in revenue last year with positive organic growth ￼, and even eked out a small net profit of $3.8 M in 2024 ￼. The company refinanced its debt in 2023 and even sold a majority stake in Insomnia Cookies to raise cash and pay down loans ￼. They’ve got an anchor investor (JAB Holding) owning ~45% ￼, so there’s deep-pocket support. In short, Krispy Kreme has dough (and doughnuts) to survive while it executes a turnaround.
	•	Downsizing & Focusing on Efficiency: Management isn’t asleep at the wheel – they’ve been restructuring to cut fat and boost unit economics. Late last year they realigned their teams to prioritize profitable U.S. expansion and capital-light international growth ￼. They are even outsourcing U.S. logistics and considering refranchising some overseas stores to save costs ￼. This is the “Carvana playbook”: streamline operations and focus on core efficiency. The result? Adjusted EBITDA margins in its franchise segment are nearly 58% now ￼, and overall EBITDA was ~$193 M in 2024 ￼ – not stellar, but showing they can splurge out cash even while expanding.
	•	Global Expansion – Donuts Everywhere: Remember how Carvana scaled distribution? Krispy Kreme is doing something similar with donuts. The company has built a unique hub-and-spoke network to deliver fresh doughnuts daily to thousands of retail locations. In Q1, global “points of access” (POA) jumped 19% as they launched new shops in France, Brazil, and Germany and expanded retail partnerships ￼ ￼. They even struck a deal with McDonald’s in 2022–2024 to sell Krispy Kreme donuts at McD’s restaurants, aiming to add 12,000 new locations by 2026 ￼ ￼. (More on that below.) They raised their long-term goal from 75k to 100,000 global points of sale for Krispy Kreme, which gives you an idea of their ambition ￼. Bottom line: they’re putting hot donuts in front of customers wherever those customers already are – be it a Walmart, Target, supermarket, or a highway gas station in Johannesburg ￼ ￼.

Krispy Kreme’s iconic Original Glazed® doughnuts are now delivered worldwide through partnerships – reaching convenience stores, supermarkets, and even fuel station shops ￼. The company’s global points of access grew 24% in 2024 to 17,557 locations as it aggressively expands its distribution network.
	•	Pivoting the Business Model: Krispy Kreme learned from its past mistakes (remember the early 2000s sugar rush and crash). Back then, they over-expanded stores and stuffed supermarkets with day-old donuts, which hurt the brand ￼. Now they’ve pivoted – instead of relying on customers to come to Krispy Kreme shops, they bring fresh donuts to the customers. They’ve invested heavily in centralized production hubs that supply fresh donuts daily to kiosks and shelves in other stores (what they call “Delivered Fresh Daily” (DFD)) ￼ ￼. It’s working: in Q4 2024 they surpassed $100 M in DFD sales for the first time ￼. The new model is “omni-channel”: keep a handful of hot light factory stores in each region, but use them to supply grocery chains, convenience stores, and QSR partners at scale ￼ ￼. This is a much better funnel. Customers are more likely to grab a Krispy Kreme when they see it at their local coffee shop or supermarket than to drive out of their way to a Krispy Kreme shop. By meeting consumers where they already shop, Krispy Kreme converts impulse buys without spending a fortune on marketing – effectively letting partners’ foot traffic do the work.
	•	It’s (Almost) a Fair Deal for Customers: Under the new strategy, Krispy Kreme doesn’t charge you directly a premium; instead it charges the partner retailers. For example, in South Africa, Krispy Kreme partnered with the Engen petrol station chain so travelers can “pick up fresh doughnuts 24/7” at convenience stores for the same price as in Krispy Kreme’s own shops ￼ ￼. In the U.S., a customer can get an Original Glazed as an add-on in their Walmart run or drive-thru coffee. The convenience is part of the value. People won’t pay extra or wait in long lines for a donut nowadays – but if it’s right there in front of them, they’ll grab it. Krispy Kreme finally figured that out, and it’s now leveraging partner networks (like the planned expansion from just 25% of Walmarts to many more ￼). More reach, less friction = more sales.
	•	McDonald’s Partnership: Bold Move (Even If It Ended): You probably heard Krispy Kreme was entering McDonald’s nationwide – a huge deal, theoretically adding ~12,000 new outlets in the US alone ￼. They piloted in 160 stores and by early 2024 had expanded to 2,400 McDonald’s locations selling Krispy Kremes ￼. Now here’s the twist: in June 2025, McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme mutually agreed to end the rollout, citing it wasn’t profitable enough for Krispy Kreme to sustain ￼ ￼. On the surface that sounds bad – and the stock did drop on the news. But think about it: the companies called it a “strong collaboration” that just didn’t meet cost targets ￼ ￼. Krispy Kreme proved it could integrate into a massive QSR’s system and deliver quality product at scale (2,400 stores is not a small test!). The demand was there; the issue was margins. Rather than burn cash, Krispy Kreme wisely pulled back to refocus on channels with better economics. Importantly, they’re not giving up on the concept of expanding through partners – the CEO said they plan to make doughnuts “available in more places” both nationally and internationally going forward ￼. In other words, if not McDonald’s, then maybe Wendy’s or Dunkin’s competitors, or simply more grocery chains. The infrastructure (hubs, delivery routes) they ramped up for McD’s can now be used to serve other customers with higher profit per donut. This ability to pivot and re-deploy assets is a positive sign of discipline – they’re chasing profitable growth, not growth at any cost.
	•	No More Lighting Money on Fire: All this restructuring and refocusing is already improving the bottom line. After years of heavy expansion costs, Krispy Kreme’s free cash flow turned positive in 2024 (about $46 M operating cash flow) ￼ ￼. They’ve slowed down on building expensive new stores (CapEx was ~7.3% of revenue in 2024, down from prior years) ￼ ￼, and instead use franchise partners for new markets. They cut some overhead and duplicated costs by consolidating international operations. For example, in early 2023 they refinanced their credit facilities to lower interest costs (taking out old 2019 debt) ￼. In Q4 2024, they also reduced supply chain finance liabilities by $44 M using proceeds from the Insomnia Cookies sale ￼ ￼. The result is a leaner balance sheet and more focus on core donut economics. We can already see improvement: the U.S. segment, despite flat organic sales, held its Sales-per-hub steady and kept DFD sales per door fairly solid ￼ ￼ (even factoring in a late-2024 cyberattack blip). International segment sales grew nicely (+7.8% organic in 2024) with 14% more access points ￼, showing the franchise markets can scale with minimal capital from corporate. They’re no longer burning cash on vanity projects – they’re tuning the machine to crank out profit when volume picks up.
	•	Seasonality and Demand: Krispy Kreme Gets It: Opendoor had to learn home prices are seasonal; Krispy Kreme has learned donuts are occasion-driven. The company now times product pushes for holidays and events. Example: their Valentine’s Day specialty donuts (Feb 2024) led to the biggest sales day in Krispy Kreme’s history ￼. They’re leaning into promotional spikes – that boosts revenue without permanent cost increases. On the flip side, there’s been concern that health trends (like the Ozempic craze for weight loss) will dampen demand for sugary treats. That fear helped knock the stock to all-time lows (investors started pricing Krispy Kreme like it’s cigarettes or something). But so far, the actual sales don’t show a donut Armageddon: Krispy Kreme has logged 18 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth through end of 2024 ￼. People may take diabetes drugs, but they still buy donuts for the office, for parties, and as comfort food. The resilience of indulgence shouldn’t be underestimated – even in a tough economy, Krispy Kreme held revenue basically flat in 2024 (–1.2% reported, +5.0% organic) ￼ ￼. When the macro environment improves (e.g. inflation eases, consumers have more discretionary income) or the “eat healthy” hype cycle fades, a treat like Krispy Kreme is often the first little luxury people come back to. The company has positioned itself to be everywhere for that moment.
	•	First Profits in Years on the Horizon: In fact, Krispy Kreme is on track to post its first meaningful quarterly profits in years. They were adjusted EBITDA profitable all along, but now even GAAP net income is expected to turn upward. 2024 was basically break-even on a net basis ￼, which is a huge improvement over the $36 M loss the year prior. Looking ahead, they’ve given guidance for continued organic growth in 2025 and beyond. They’re optimizing routes and recipes (no joke: even slight changes in donut mix can improve margins). With interest expenses likely peaking (they refinanced debt at fixed rates and paid some down), any growth in operating profit will start flowing to the bottom line. Sell-side analysts have noted that Krispy Kreme’s capex binge is winding down, so the cash flow and profit metrics should inflect upward in the next 1–2 years (similar to how Carvana turned the corner once it reined in growth). If Krispy Kreme even achieves a modest 5-10% operating margin on $1.7B+ revenue, that’s $85–$170M operating profit – on a company with a current market cap around $500M. The upside if they execute is enormous.
	•	Path to Sweeter Margins: How do they get there? A few levers: (1) Logistics savings – outsourcing donut delivery to third parties could save millions (management explicitly is doing this) ￼. (2) Refranchising – franchisees bear new store costs and pay Krispy Kreme royalties, which are high-margin for corporate. Every international store they refranchise converts low-margin revenue into high-margin royalty income. (3) Less debt = less interest – they cut net debt by ~$30M in 2024 after the refinancing and have positive cash flow now to keep chipping away ￼ ￼. If interest rates stabilize or drop, their $900M debt load becomes more affordable (and remember, a lot of that debt funded acquisitions/expansion that should generate returns). (4) More DFD revenue – every new point of access they add brings incremental sales with relatively little overhead increase. The CFO estimated adding 15,000 points of access by 2026 should drive $340–$430M in extra annual revenue ￼. That could push total sales over $2B, with much of that growth coming through existing production capacity (i.e. higher utilization of hubs = better economies of scale). (5) Disciplined marketing – Krispy Kreme has drastically pulled back mass advertising; they rely on social media and the natural appeal of fresh donuts (the “Hot Now” sign still works) rather than SuperBowl ads. They’re also leveraging partners (e.g. let McDonald’s or Walmart do the marketing to get people in the door, then just supply the product). All these moves combined hint that Krispy Kreme could realistically swing to solid profitability in the next year or two without any heroic assumptions.
	•
	•	Valuation is a Joke (in a Good Way): Let’s talk numbers: at ~$3/share, DNUT’s market cap is only about $525 M ￼. Price-to-sales = 0.3× (for a business growing ~5% organically ￼). By comparison, profitable “treat” franchises trade at much higher multiples: Wingstop trades around 8× sales and *40× EBITDA, and Dunkin’ (pre-acquisition) was taken private at ~6× sales. Now, Krispy Kreme’s margins are currently much thinner than those peers, but that’s the opportunity! If management even gets close to industry-average margins, the valuation gap is ridiculous. Even on a price-to-book basis, DNUT is around 1.1× book – basically pricing it like a no-growth, no-brand company. Yet Krispy Kreme is an 86-year-old globally recognized brand (people literally line up for hours when a new country gets its first Krispy Kreme). The last time the stock was this hated (mid-2000s), a private buyer (JAB) swooped in and bought the whole company. I wouldn’t be surprised if JAB or another savvy investor is eyeing it again at these prices. At the very least, the stock has massive re-rating potential if results improve. For instance, even a move to 1× sales (still a big discount to peers) would mean a >3× stock price from here.
	•	Risks and Mitigations: Sure, there are risks. Maybe the “Americans are eating healthier” trend persists and donut demand stalls. Perhaps competition from Dunkin’ or local bakeries limits growth. And execution is key – Krispy Kreme must manage quality control as it scales (we don’t want a repeat of the stale doughnut glut of 2004 ￼). But the company is aware of these issues. The whole point of the new model is to keep donuts fresher and closer to the consumer to drive impulse sales ￼. They also have product innovation (e.g. partnering with brands like KitKat for limited-time flavors) to keep buzz alive. As for health trends: let’s be real, donuts aren’t going extinct. In moderation, people will always indulge – and Krispy Kreme’s sales trends back that up. With the stock priced for disaster, the bar is low. If Krispy Kreme merely continues moderate growth and achieves modest margin gains, the stock could easily double or triple. If they knock it out of the park (e.g. 10%+ margins, strong growth), we could be looking at a 10-bagger. And if not, the downside at this point seems limited – it’s already near rock-bottom valuations and has a stable revenue base supported by small luxury consumer sends .

1m29v7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1m29v7z/why_top_businesses_outsource_net_development_and/,Why Top Businesses Outsource .NET Development (And What Smart Devs Should Know About It),"If you’ve ever typed *""how to find a reliable .NET development company""* or *""tips for outsourcing .NET software projects""* into Google at 2 AM while juggling a product backlog and spiraling budget, you’re not alone. .NET is still a powerhouse for enterprise applications, and outsourcing it isn’t just a smart move—it’s increasingly the default.

But let’s rewind for a second: **Why is .NET development so frequently outsourced?** And if you’re a dev reading this on your third coffee, should you be worried or thrilled? Either way, knowing how this works behind the scenes is good strategy—whether you’re hiring or getting hired.

# .NET Is Enterprise Gold (But Not Everyone Wants to Mine It Themselves)

.NET isn’t flashy. It doesn’t go viral on GitHub or show up in trendy JavaScript memes. But it’s *everywhere* in serious business environments: ERP systems, fintech platforms, custom CRMs, secure internal apps—the kind of things you never see on Product Hunt but that quietly move billions.

Here’s the catch: these projects demand **reliability, scalability, and long-term maintainability**. Building and maintaining .NET applications is not a one-and-done job. It’s a marathon, not a sprint—and marathons are exhausting when your internal team’s already buried in other priorities.

This is where outsourcing comes in. Not as a band-aid, but as a **strategic lever**.

# Why Smart Companies Outsource Their .NET Projects

Outsourcing has evolved. It’s no longer a race to the cheapest bidder. Instead, companies are asking sharper questions:

* How quickly can this partner ramp up?
* Do they use modern .NET (Core, 6/7/8) or are they still clinging to .NET Framework like it's 2012?
* Can they handle migration from legacy systems (VB6, anyone)?
* Do they follow SOLID principles or just SOLIDIFY the tech debt?

One company we came across that fits this modern outsourcing profile is **Abto Software**. They've been doing serious .NET work for years, including .NET migration and rebuilding legacy systems into cloud-first architectures. They focus on long-term partnerships, not just burn-and-churn dev work.

For business leaders, this means faster time to market without babysitting the tech side. For developers, it means a chance to work on complex systems with high impact—but without the chaos of internal politics.

# Outsourcing .NET Is Not Just About Saving Money

Sure, costs matter. But today’s decision-makers look at **TTV** (Time to Value), **DORA metrics**, and how quickly the team can iterate without crashing into deployment pipelines like a clown car on fire.

Outsourced .NET development can *accelerate* delivery while improving code quality—if you choose right. That’s because many outsourcing partners have seen every horror story in the book. They’ve untangled dependency injection setups that looked like spaghetti. They’ve migrated monoliths bigger than your company wiki.

They also bring repeatable processes—CI/CD pipelines, reusable libraries, internal frameworks—so you’re not reinventing the wheel with every new request.

And let’s be honest: unless your core business *is* .NET development, you probably don’t want your senior staff bogged down fixing flaky async tasks and broken EF Core migrations.

# Developers: Why You Should Care (Even If You’re Not Outsourcing Yet)

Let’s flip the script.

If you’re a developer, outsourcing sounds like a threat—until you realize it’s a **huge opportunity**.

Many of the best .NET developers I know work for outsourcing companies and consultancies. Why? Because they get access to projects that stretch their skills: cross-platform Blazor apps, microservices running on Azure Kubernetes, GraphQL APIs that interact with legacy SQL Server monsters from 2003.

And they learn fast—because they have to. You won’t sharpen your regex game fixing the same five bugs on a B2B dashboard for five years. You *will* when you're helping four different clients optimize LINQ queries and write multithreaded background services that don't explode under load.

And if you freelance or run your own shop? Knowing how outsourcing works lets you speak the language of clients who are looking for someone to “just make this legacy .NET thing work without killing our roadmap.”

# Tips for Choosing the Right .NET Outsourcing Partner

Choosing a .NET partner isn’t like hiring a freelancer on Fiverr to tweak a WordPress theme. It’s more like picking a co-pilot for a cross-country flight in a 20-year-old aircraft that still mostly flies… usually.

Here’s what you should look for:

* **Technical maturity**: Can they handle async programming, signalR, WPF, and MAUI—not just MVC?
* **Migration experience**: Can they move you from .NET Framework to .NET 8 without downtime?
* **DevOps fluency**: Do they deploy with CI/CD or FTP through tears?
* **Transparent comms**: Are their proposals clear, or do they hide behind buzzwords?

If you’re not asking these questions, you might as well outsource your money into a black hole.

# Final Thoughts: Outsourcing .NET Is a Cheat Code (If You Use It Right)

.NET might not be the loudest tech stack online, but in enterprise development, it’s still king. Whether you’re scaling a fintech app, modernizing an ERP, or just trying to sleep at night without worrying about deadlocks, outsourcing your .NET dev might be the best move you make.

But do it smart.

Whether you’re a company looking for reliability or a dev chasing variety, understanding how top .NET development companies work—like Abto Software—can put you ahead of the pack.

And if you're the kind of dev who thinks `(?=.*\basync\b)` is a perfectly acceptable way to filter your inbox for tasks, you're probably ready to play at this level.

She was very good company and I was blessed to engage in conversation,  which is highly unlikely in a Dennys.
Anyway she usually doesn't work morning shift around 7am today I went in and she was there! She sat me down, I was alone and brought me coffee then another woman came by and rushed me to order and the redhead waitress was getting coffee for a huge party of 6 and cleaning another table. The woman, Brandi(i found out her name and that she was the new manager of this store) and another girl with her came back within seconds pressuring me again, more drinks, appetizer (at 7am) pushing sales. I saw my server Dina looking tired, down as she picked up dishes and brought coffee to this party of 6. I stopped her and asked how come she wasn't my server, I love her no nonsense way, she said she had been there since 10pm the night before amd it was now 7:19 a.m.  I told her to hold out for the party of 6,possible big tip- but she responded my manager said to leave and give the table to her assistant. I watched this girl be at that tables service,  brought 3 trays of food , one all toast! I hate injustice regardless where I find it, I am an attorney and still practice for the underdog. I have experienced top notch selfless service from this girl,  the new manager is pushy and abrasive. The thought that this dina waited for a good size party that may tip even $15.00(this location is usually empty 98% of the time) only to hand it over to new mangement and their yesmen made me sad and a bit angry
 I watched this lady clean, bus the tables and then she waved goodbye and I saw her get into an old Suv with hurt , disappointment on her face. 
*I know times are tough and hard but tip your waitress even $5, they work very hard for less than minimum wage. They have struggles, they have to play a game with there unqualified mangement to even be noticed. I felt the heavy load this lady carries- I am thinking of taking this a step further- just to do what is right for this lady who is unable to fight for herself",1,1752764360.0,dennysrestaurant,0,1.0,False

That said I am used to a grinder that either has a knocker or a bellows and the Z1 had neither.

I modeled my own bellows for the Z1 which took me hours because I'm not experienced with modeling but I'm pretty happy with the result.

I figure maybe some other Zerno owners would appreciate the bellows, so I wanted to share the printable file.

I'm not selling anything and I'm not looking to sell them but if you happen to have a 3D Printer that can print TPU or know someone that does, and you want a bellows for your zerno, this will save you the work of modeling one.

I tried finding one already modeled before I built this and couldn't find one.

I did do some testing and after grinding 20g of beans and then emptying the catch cup I used the bellows and did get a fair bit of additional coffee grinds out although I didn't measure it.  To me it's not about getting it all out or how much I get - but just getting that extra little bit.

Should you wish to print your own, here's the link to the model: [https://makerworld.com/en/models/1614385-zerno-z1-bellows](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1614385-zerno-z1-bellows)

1m29oct,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseMedicine/comments/1m29oct/how_similar_are_the_concepts_of_yang_ming_jue_yin/,How similar are the concepts of Yang Ming / Jue Yin and Wei Qi / Ying Qi? Are they the same?,"In the Zhong Lu cultivation system, we are given the cyclical flow of the Zang organs, such that their Qi (yang) flows through the generative sequence of the Five Phases (the BL is included to help water transition back into wood): BL -> LV -> HT -> SP -> LU -> KD -> BL. 

But it is also explained to us that on the inhale we draw qi through us, and on our exhale we let that qi go again if we don't carefully and gently slow the breath to contain it as fluid. So when we draw the qi through an organ on the inhale, on the exhale we turn inward to allow the pressure to sink back down as fluid. 

This helps us to bring qi into an organ, and then to retain it as fluid, strengthening the jing of the organ. 

But also we have a cyclical fluid pathway that is in operation here. Breathing into the liver, filling with qi and pressure, slowing the end of the breath and feeling the relationship between the pressure and the movement of blood through the liver, turning into the exhale to nurture that flow of blood... well it goes from the liver to somewhere else. 

In the cycle of the fluid, it is following the governing relationship of the Five Phases and serves to refine and repair the organ system, replenishing their jing and so on. So we have the fluid (yin) going from LV to SP to KD (repairing KD jing) to HT to LU. 

Already we can see that the cycle of qi through the organs here relates to Wei Qi, and the cycle of fluid through the organs relates to Ying Qi. But there is a more particular aspect of these cycles I'd like to showcase here. 

In the cultivation system, it is shown that we work with the LV around sunrise and the LU around sunset. 

Real quick lets also throw in the 6 paired channels:

* At midnight, Tai Yin has culminated and Shao Yang is born. Reducing Tai Yin to Augment Shao Yang, Yang Ming is born at sunrise, as Yang enters the domain of Yang (light) and leaves the domain of Yin (dark). From here, Reducing Jue Yin even further Augments Yang Ming even more until its yang culminates as Tai Yang at noon.

* At noon, Tai Yang has culminated and Shao Yin is born. Reducing Tai Yang to Augment Shao Yin, Jue Yin is created at sunset, as Yin enters the domain of Yin (dark). From here, Reducing Yang Ming even further Augments Jue Yin even more until its Yin culminates as Tai Yin at midnight. 

So now we can see that as we are working before sunrise to augment LV qi, this is working to produce Yang Ming - Yang Brightness - light. And indeed as we go into Yang Ming, it is like our LV is purging itself of all yin to become pure yang. Same as drinking a cup of coffee and 'dredging the LV qi'. 

Well perhaps we can relate to that concept. But the idea here really seems similar to what happens with Wei Qi. It is more internal until we wake up and open our eyes. Our LV expresses its energy through the eyes. So it is like when we are bringing our LV to become purely yang, we are putting our awareness on that which is outside of us. 

Next we come to sunset. But now, from noon to midnight, we are working more with the fluid and using its yin to retain yang. So when we think about the LU, its fluid governs LV. 

In other words, as we breath in with our LU, then collect their fluid, then as it goes somewhere it is bringing its yin fluid (full of all the HT and SP medicines), to flow back into the LV, then deepening more, into the SP, then more into the KD. 

This is very much an entering back into darkness from the light. And a replenishment of Ying after being focused in the Wei. 

But when I work with this LU fluid, I find that I really need to sink my qi, close my eyes (or LV qi will try to express through them), quiet my thoughts and really get my intention to follow things back IN, to my inside. 

In the cultivation system, this marks the first overall step to accomplish. And is called the waterwheel of Mao and You, the wood and metal energies associated with LV and LU. The idea being that we need to fill with qi and fluid. Breathing through fluid produces qi, holding the breath after the inhale and gently slowly exhaling produces fluid. Once we have fluid and qi fully complete, the system can open and close more powerfully and pore breathing is fully operational.

Wei Qi manifests as we open our eyes. When we close our eyes and go to sleep the qi enters the body and Ying Qi is more dominant. In the end this is the phenomena articulated by Yang Ming and Jue Yin, but it is just given new names to acknowledge the outer and inner landscapes that are created by their function.",1,1752764057.0,ChineseMedicine,1,1.0,False

In June 2025, I traveled to Kyrgyzstan for the first time and hiked 50 miles alone across the Ak-Suu Traverse. It was my first time in Central Asia, and stepping off the plane into Bishkek felt like landing on another planet, Russian signs, Soviet-era buildings, and nomadic horse culture everywhere. For someone coming from New York City, it was a full reset.

I came here looking for an adventure, and the Ak-Suu Traverse delivered. Over four days, I carried everything I needed on my back, dodged afternoon storms, crossed cold rivers, and pitched my tent in remote alpine valleys. I saw wild horses grazing in vast meadows, herds of sheep on the move with their herders, and towering snowy peaks that reminded me of the Alps, but without the chalets, ski lifts, or crowds

Solo travel like this gives me a lot of time to think. Lately, I’ve been struggling with what it means to be a YouTuber who travels, and a new dad. I want to make art. I want to make money. I want to enjoy the experience and make the best video possible. I’m still figuring out how to do all of that at once.

This trip was personal. It wasn’t about filming a hiking guide or making the most clickable video. It was just about being there. That said, if you’re looking for detailed tips, maps, gear info, and filmmaking advice, I’ve made a separate [hiking guide video](https://youtube.com/channel/UCpnuadQ_w3r6f4Q_NRlqd-w/join) for members of my channel.  [Watch the full YouTube video](https://youtu.be/E83Mo_xGbvA?si=2muEYh4RpcTZO8uK).

**Bishkek to Karakol**

After a long flight from New York to Istanbul and then to Bishkek, I landed at 5am, jet-lagged and sleep-deprived. A local subscriber offered me a ride into the city, something I’ve learned to accept gratefully. We grabbed breakfast and talked about travel and culture. He was the first Russian I’d ever met.

I dropped my gear at Hotel Five, wandered the city, and tried to stay awake while the sun baked the pavement. I used Airalo for data ([$3 off using my code](https://ref.airalo.com/CtJw)), drank too much coffee, and played [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/space-age/buy) in my hotel room to pass the time. Soviet-era architecture gave the city a surreal atmosphere.

The next day, I hired a driver for the 7-hour drive to Karakol. We passed mosques and mountains, roadside food stops, and countless Ladas. Karakol itself felt like a sleepy mountain town, ski resort in the winter, basecamp in the summer. I stayed at [Mongu Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/kg/mongu.html?aid=356980&label=gog235jc-1FCAsod0IFbW9uZ3VIM1gDaKcCiAEBmAExuAEHyAEN2AEB6AEB-AECiAIBqAIDuALSleTDBsACAdICJDIyN2RlODM1LTk4NDctNGE1OS1iZjVlLTQ0NjAxODMxZGM2ONgCBeACAQ&sid=dc27b13a40b7cb4edb802b0a9858caaa&dest_id=-2331996&dest_type=city&dist=0&group_adults=2&group_children=0&hapos=1&hpos=1&no_rooms=1&req_adults=2&req_children=0&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&sr_order=popularity&srepoch=1752763097&srpvid=c9c266e99240067b&type=total&ucfs=1&), grabbed fuel for my stove, and got my gear ready for the hike.

**Day 1: A Late Start and Early Storm (**[**Map**](https://alltrails.com/explore/recording/afternoon-hike-73231e5-870)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/jd78egq95gdf1.jpg?width=2009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=022d89f9625258882823a99e7a2178ad7d08a3cb

After breakfast on the rooftop terrace, I left my duffel at the hotel and met the taxi driver. The road ended sooner than expected, which meant seven extra miles of uphill hiking to reach the trailhead. The first 10 miles felt brutal, direct sun, dusty road, no shade.

At 10,000 ft, I started to feel it. Tired, dehydrated, and then, thunder. I rushed to pitch my tent as dark clouds rolled in. My new [Hyperlite Mid 1](https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&website_id=6d5af2e1-8bce-4482-80ae-719db9bb2128&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmid-1-tent%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3D18855145402%26utm_source%3D148923682974%26tw_source%3Dgoogle%26tw_adid%3D662075650690%26tw_campaign%3D18855145402%26gad_source%3D1%26gbraid%3D0AAAAADn7vcYh_PN2dqGvpdAyp7oPEzVV5%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwp8--BhBREiwAj7og11pCba6qG7HTs7FenWmBTR2OUONkSMptvsfZJIrqbESvx9rI2x7rkRoCNL8QAvD_BwE) held up fine. I cooked ramen with collected rainwater and waited out the storm. Later, I hiked a bit further, crossed a foggy pass with zero visibility, and camped again before the rain hit

**Day 2: Big Views and Long Mile (**[**Map**](https://alltrails.com/explore/recording/afternoon-hike-b132ecc-799)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/kp8zcqoc5gdf1.jpg?width=2489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dcb47cbd3dc9e1634dae0107a1f1aa138c87da5

Waking up to clear skies changed everything. I launched the drone and finally got a sense of where I was. Huge mountains, fresh snow, reflections in the lakes. It felt like I had the entire world to myself.

I hiked 14 miles that day with nearly 5,000 ft of gain, up over snowy passes, through wildflower-filled valleys, and past yurt camps. I tested out the [DJI Mavic 3 Air’s](https://amzn.to/4kOM5JE) telephoto lens on a few shots. At one pass, I took a long break just to sit and soak in the silence.

I camped early that night near a small stream, too wiped out to continue. I regretted not packing my Crocs. After a full day of wet feet and steep climbs, nothing beats slipping into camp shoes. I made miso soup and watched the stars come out, briefly, before climbing into my bag.

**Day 3: Into Arashan Valley (**[**Map**](https://alltrails.com/explore/recording/afternoon-hike-90b8e8e-793)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/6njemnxv5gdf1.jpg?width=2490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ff8ccaec2486936d2822d98c82102a3ad3e611f

The morning was calm and quiet. I ate granola by a stream and hiked up to a familiar view, snow patches, rock cairns, and a descent into a grassy valley divided by a winding river. Horses and cows grazed along the banks. Eventually, I reached Arashan, a more built-up area with yurt lodges and tea houses.

I stopped for tea, checked my GPS on WiFi, and decided to keep going. A hailstorm caught me mid-climb and pelted me with what looked like dip’n dots. I pushed through it and camped at a yurt shell below the next pass. The hosts made garlicky noodles with potatoes and endless tea. I barely saw anyone else. I got 10 hours of sleep that night.

**Day 4: Ala-Köl and the Finish Line (**[**Map**](https://alltrails.com/explore/recording/afternoon-hike-d594b1a-810)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/nr3juasz5gdf1.jpg?width=2489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=338f2e6f4decdc35e9d56857cde913b912699ba4

I woke to gray skies and packed up early. The trail climbed steeply over loose rocks and snow patches until I reached a ridge above Ala-Köl, a turquoise alpine lake surrounded by sharp peaks and low-hanging clouds. A large group of Dutch hikers arrived at the same time, so I dropped down quickly toward the water.

The descent was long, muddy, and dramatic. Waterfalls, pine trees, wildflowers. I reached the Karakol River and bought a Coke from a truck. I crossed to a yurt camp, had tea with some builders working on cabins, and eventually met my jeep for the wild ride back into town.

**Back in Karakol**

I stayed two nights in Karakol, drying gear, doing laptop work, and eating pizza at [Imperiya Pitstsy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gJQ4xmKzgNzqBdCHA). My hotel host didn’t speak English but made up for it with kindness and cats. On my final evening, I met up with [Ibriam](https://www.instagram.com/ibraim.explorer/), who helped me plan the whole thing.

If you're thinking of doing this hike, I highly recommend it. The traverse is rugged, remote, and gorgeous. And if you want a more detailed breakdown, maps, gear, weather, photo tips, editing notes, I made a full guide video for members.

I also uploaded a [3-hour ambient version](https://youtu.be/rPSgLjkPIIs?si=QQ7yv7NJqbYKIVG8) of the hike and shared 7 hours of raw footage, in case you're curious how I shoot and edit these videos.

I also enjoy small things like walking in Cubbon Park, watching a stand-up comedy show, or taking a quick weekend trip to coorg, chikmangulur or nandi Hills. Yes, traffic is crazy and rent is high, but if you can adjust, Bangalore has a nice balance of peaceful mornings, busy workdays, and fun nights that makes you want to stay.

A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",2,1752763486.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1m2993j,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1m2993j/struggling_with_sleep_after_3rd_cup/,Struggling with sleep after 3rd cup.,"Hey all,

I  made the switch from instant coffee to brewing at home a few months back. Got myself a French press, a C2, and now a V60 and I’ve been loving the process especially since i got the V60. The taste difference was immediate, and it’s honestly got me hooked.

I usually brew a cup using a 1:15 ratio with 15g of coffee, and one or two cups a day don’t give me any issues.

However, in the last to last week , I’ve had days where I drank 3 or more cups (brewed using French-press), with the last one around 6~6:30 PM. On those days, I couldn’t fall asleep until 5~6 AM. It completely messed up my sleep schedule, wake up in the middle of the night, feeling wide awake at odd hours, and then be sleepy during the day.

The only change in my routine was my coffee intake both in quantity and timing.

Has anyone else faced something similar? How do you manage it?

Right now I’m experimenting with 3 cups a day (10g each), with the last one no later than 3 PM.

But that leaves a long window from 3 PM. I was thinking to do 6:30am then 12pm and then 5pm since now i am doing 10gm instead of 15. But the thought of again having to waste a week fixing sleep makes me reconsider.   

Has anyone else faced this and experimented with the timing or quantity of coffee affecting sleep? Or is this kind of sensitivity just very individual?

Using the Ihomekee CM9428C coffee maker feels like stepping into a world where coffee brewing has been simplified yet modernized to accommodate diverse tastes. As someone who practically lives on coffee, I’ve explored a multitude of coffee machines, but this programmable coffee maker is an intriguing mix of functionality, aesthetics, and convenience. However, perfection is rare, and this machine has some quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

At first glance, the coffee maker’s sleek black finish and stainless steel accents caught my attention. It’s compact enough to fit on any countertop comfortably, yet its design offers plenty of functionality. My kitchen didn’t feel swamped as the machine measures just 14.8""D x 7.5""W x 11.2""H. The LCD touchscreen display is a standout—you can’t help but feel a little fancy tapping through its various settings when brewing a cup. However, the plastic used for certain parts, like the filter housing, made me wonder about its long-term durability. Although lightweight at just 4.91 pounds, it holds steady during operation.

**Performance and Features**

This is where the Ihomekee coffee maker shines the brightest. As someone who juggles between home-brewed iced coffee in summer and piping hot mugs in winter, I thoroughly enjoyed its flexible settings. The iced coffee function was an unexpected delight; tossing in a couple of ice cubes and getting a refreshing iced coffee within minutes is convenience at its finest. The bold brew setting was another game-changer—it elevated the intensity of my morning cup, perfect for those who enjoy robust flavors.  

The 12-cup capacity means it’s perfect for busy households or even small offices. I'm not going to lie—my coworkers were thrilled the day I used it to serve freshly brewed coffee during a meeting. The non-stick carafe plate that keeps coffee warm for 40 minutes after brewing is such a well-thought-out feature. Still, I found myself wishing it could keep the coffee warm a bit longer, especially when hosting guests.

[Check Ihomekee CM9428C price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cvv1gyhl/)

**Ease of Use**

Navigating its functions felt incredibly intuitive, thanks to the touch screen and LCD display. Its semi-automatic operation made it straightforward for me to set brewing schedules—a lifesaver for mornings where every second counts. However, while the machine is user-friendly, I wouldn’t categorize the instructions as the clearest. Out of curiosity, a family member of mine tried using it but had to reference Google just to understand the delayed-brewing function.

**Pluses**

- Versatile brewing settings, including regular, bold, and iced coffee functions.
- Touchscreen and programmable timer for effortless operation.
- 12-cup brewing capacity—a boon when entertaining guests.
- Safety-focused with auto-shutoff after two hours.  
- Certified ETL safety-approved and BPA-free, easing health concerns.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Plastic components feel less premium than the rest of the design.
- Instructions could use improvement for better user clarity.  
- Keeping coffee warm beyond the 40-minute mark would be an appreciated enhancement.

**Other Options**

Having tested similar coffee makers, two contenders stand out: the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and the Ninja CE251. While the Ihomekee brew system allows for iced coffee and programmatic brewing, the FlexBrew stands out for its dual brewing system, which accommodates K-Cups. If customizability is a priority, the Ninja CE251’s thermal flavor extraction system provides slightly better-tasting coffee. That said, the Ihomekee coffee maker is unbeatable in terms of its affordability and all-in-one capability that merges iced coffee, a programmable screen, and bold brew adjustments.

**Bang for the Buck**

Relative to competitors, the Ihomekee CM9428C coffee maker strikes a great balance of value for money. With bonus features like a keep-warm plate, an intuitive touch display, and multi-cup brewing, its cost feels justified for home and office use alike. Some high-end brands like Breville or Ninja may have certain bells and whistles, but this unit holds its ground quite confidently in its price range without feeling overly stripped down.

I'm from the capital city of my country and have loved here in poverty my whole life. And I don't always feel this way but today was as best an example I can think of. Today is my day off after days of getting bullied by my manager for minimum wage. So I've struggled to get that out of my mind while I try and read The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie. And for the life of me I'm finding it nearly impossible.

This morning I had an opticians appointment and so I killed 20 minutes before the appointment with a coffee while I read in the coffee shop. I'm sitting there and two guys on hoods burst on and steal boxes of doughnuts along with some bottles of drink. They scream obscenities and run off. I can't get back in the book afterwards. Then later I'm at home trying to read. Someone phones me and it's scammer trying to steal my information, claiming an issue with my phone. I'm so annoyed I can't get back into it. Then later I'm at the train station waiting for a train to the supermarket. I'm reading until I hear a smash. There's a guy on the opposite platform screaming at people and throwing bottles onto the track! My train comes along afterwards and with limited seating ok sat next to 3 people's vaping, 3 speakerphone conversations and someone watching Tiktok at full volume.

It's not just a volume or distraction issue IMO. It's like the world has become so distopian that immersive distraction feels impossible sometimes. Like there's no point in fantasy sometimes because it doesn't reflect anything left in this modern world. This is entirely just an opinion and I'd love to hear what you guys think.

1m296ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/1m296ea/definition_of_veganism_is_rather_flexible_and/,"Definition of Veganism is rather ""flexible"" and unrigorous, making debate around it difficult","To clarify my point let see the definition given in this very sub: 

Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products (particularly in regard to diet) and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. The term was originally coined in 1944 by members of what would come to be called The Vegan Society, and they gave it the following definition:

Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

I am presented with two definitions for the vegan philosophy. One ""official"" by the vegan society that focuses on minimizing exploitation and cruelty against animals. The other one instead that focuses on animal commodification. These are not at all the same. Example: A friend gifts me a puppy. I install microchip and get all docs in order. I treat the puppy very well, cuddles, food and everything like most western pets. So no cruelty. I also don't make any money from it, so no exploitation. By the official definition, my behavior is in line with veganism. But clearly not by the second definition since I still own the puppy and decide for it. The other way round example is also possible: I drink coffee. Coffee plantation require a lot of insecticides that cause harm to an incredible amount of insects and other animals (feel free to google the biblical loss of life caused by insecticides). Yet coffee has virtually no nutritional value. It is pure taste pleasure. It is also very possible and practicable for literally anyone to quit drinking it and save countless lifes. So by the vegan society definition, coffee should not be vegan. But from the second definition, it is vegan since there is no commodification of animals involved, just mass killings. This lack of rigour in a precise definition allows vegans to easily adopt motte and bailey strategies when talking with non vegans: Arguing around the ethics of eating meat? That requires killing and torturing animals which is morally wrong! If you are against animal cruelty, you should be vegan!

1m2969r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1m2969r/i_have_frens_that_make_me_uncomfortable_and_i/,I have frens that make me uncomfortable and I can’t wait to move on,"I feel like all the frens I make that become rly close with me (like those that I tell personal stuff to) all have at least 1 major flaw or problem and I can’t have a genuine convo with a trustworthy fren I can rely on. Ok so let’s call one A. I started talking to a during cca 2 yrs ago. Great person, giving gifts, comforting and helping me. But she has a lot of issues, 1, parents are divorced badly and although I try to be understanding, everytime I want to be happy and share gd news, there r a huge problem at home and she rants abt her problem. I’m not bashing kids with divorced parents, but I feel like when I even want to share my problems, she trauma dumps a lil and I feel like I can’t share my probs. A does say I can share my probs with her but like girl u have larger probs on ur hands. 2 she try’s to like poke fun at me and it makes me uncomfortable. Im in an all girls sch btw and like we were so close that there were gay allegations. She tries to teasing call me ‘mommy’ or ‘daddy’ but like no. Just no. I’ve started this thing where I block her for 8 hrs when she says it and the time gets progressively longer. Im catholic and not comfortable with gay allegations like actually what no I like boys 💀 ya the allegations can get rly bad cuz she is a touchy person n is always trying to touch me in intimate places like my leg and asks me to hold her hand when she gets scared. Like it’s getting obnoxious or has been. Sometimes I regret being her fren. The allegations are so bad our cca coach thinks we r gay. She is also in o lvl drama and her monologue was about a pregnant nun(ironic this happens in a catholic sch) and when asked abt who the dad is everyone says me. I feel weirded out when this happens like no I def didn’t not consent to this. 3. It’s kinda connected to 2 but a lot of ppl think of us as a package deal and always ask me abt her. I AM NOT HER HALF, IM NOT HER MOM. I AM MY OWN PERSON. Im so frustrated bcuz when smth happens to her(like if she’s sick that happens a lot, ya she has many diff sickness too ikr) I get asked where is she like bish idk we r not conjoined twins. Then what gets me is my cca instructor talks to A a lot and my instructor always talks to me about stupid sht she says, like haha but uh I don’t need a report on her stupidity and obliviousness (sometimes). I always feel like instead of being labeled as (insert my name here) I am labelled (A’s best friend/ girlfriend) like maybe it’s like rude but MY PERSONALITY IS NOT BEING HER BEST FREN ONLY like it doesn’t mean she does lots of recreational stuff and I do nothing except being her fren. 4 Is it healthy if meeting ur fren or receiving a text from her is meant to make u nervous and ur chest gets rly tight with discomfort. It’s not right? But she has this rly sensitive side and once I called her stupid on accident then she gets hurt n doesn’t talk to me for a few days, but she calls me like ‘daddy’ and I have to only walk off saying no which I think she thinks is funny. A has this ‘I must help ppl change for the better’ mentality and is rly polite. And it’s killing me slowly. I know I have problems but I have even more pressing issues now that ur sensitivity sometimes. So she always asks if she can tell em smth and it’s always ‘r we gonna be best frens forever’ (honestly I wanna tell her no now)’or ‘insert issue here’ ya is this healthy if I keep avoiding her texts since it always deep n personal qns (like ya I like being personal but I need less serious shat smtimes yk) I always dread reading the texts and like always read it like hours after cuz my chest gets rly tight and I feel like I can’t breathe when she texts me ‘can I tell u smth’ I feel like I wanted to befren her in the beginning bcuz I could be goofy with her and she won’t care, and also we both have some similar hobbies. But it’s NVR like that anymore. 
Ok fren B. I am frens with her from tuition and we have the same goofy anergy but also many probs. 1 when she is late(frequently) it is by a LANDSLIDE.  B told me to meet at the mrt to be productive and study. On a public holiday she asked me to meet at 7:30 (sm how same time as sch like girl lemme sleep) guess what time she shows up. 1 hr and 15 MINS LATER. we r supposed to meet for breakfast. Waited for 40 mins at mrt asking her where she is. No response until 8:45. Im starving and go eat bfast. She arrives at the Starbucks at 9:15( she suggested the meeting time btw) 2. Her mom is involved in almost every hang out we have. Like at the library to study. Mom is there to save seats for her precious daughter. Starbucks. Same thing. Istg everytime we hang out by accident or not her mom is always there. Her mom is also vv pushy. Once she asked me to eat dinner tgt at like 7:40. My curfew to takeaway and go home was 8:30 latest (my house is 10 min away). Tries to convince me to eat with them for at least 5 mins and says it’ll be rly fast no socialising needed. I reject multiple times and tell her abt my curfew. She says fine and has that face when ppl wanna tsk at u. She then follows mr to the coffee shoot and tries to pay for me meal. Ik it’s nice but uh u trying too hard lady 3 her mom is like half her brain. I wanted to host smth special for her bday. Asked her what she wanted to do. She said she doesn’t know cuz her mom has a list 😑 like mam it’s ur bday not ur moms. And she can’t name me stuff she wants to do. Mind u this happens for 40mins at 11 the day b4 the celebration. She says she text abt it in the morning. Girl no I am not waking up at 6 to read ur text abt when and where to meet and to only meets at 9/10.  All in all her mom is rly pushy and im rly annoyed her mom does everything for her but i also feel kinda bad cuz she says im closer to her than to ppl in her sch which is nice but (im starting to maybe c y) 4, not a big prob but she joined the same tuition class as me (diff tuition sub) cuz she feels lonely in the other timeslot i cannot join. She tries to convince me to join her but i am busy with family stuff. Then joins my class. It’s ok but like i have a fren in the current class’s and I wanna talk to her, but with lonely B, I have to entertain B and try not to talk too much to my fren to avoid making B feel left out. 
 But it’s rly awkward cuz they are almost polar opposite in personality and I NVR get to talk to my fren in sch properly. 
So I was rly close to A and B and they r both gd ppl but have rly big problems. Im graduating this year and honestly rly just want to start my social life anew when I go to my next sch. I am counting down days til the next sch year cuz I can’t wait to get rid of them and get better frens. Is this normal to want to leave my old frens in the past? And am I going insane or r these ppl like not the best ppl to hang out with (sometimes feels weird or a bit toxic)? I need help in general. Im Alrdy so stressed abt exams and like personal issues and having these 2 make me even more stressed( sometimes they r the cause of stress cuz I am apparently the rational and clearheaded fren) I honestly can’t think of 1 person I want to see in my next sch (except my true bff that has been with me for 10 years now, but she wants do got to a diff sch)
Ya lemme know y’all’s thoughts, am I insane for thinking all of this, what can I do going forward till the next sch year starts in around 9 months

I have been dealing with terrible postpartum depression ever since. The weight of being a parent is unmanageable. And in the numb state of purgatory, I haven't been sleeping. I have started connecting the dots about my young adulthood. And my family. My therapist says this is a phenomenal breakthrough, as I haven't been able to remember much of that last year with my family. So, even though I’m going to sound crazy, I've decided to recount it the best I can remember from start to finish.** 

I’m sick of the road, I'm sick of this place already, and we're not even here. 

We've been driving for days to a small town in Maine. Never even heard of this place. But Dad says it'll be a great fresh start, plus the money is better. 

I miss my old room already, I miss the Georgia peach air, I miss the warmth. This place already feels cold and dead. Driving up, there were golden and red tree lines. The branches on these trees seem lifeless. The trees have no leaves here, As if it's perpetual winter.  

The roads seem vacant of any atmosphere. Why would anyone live in such a static place? 

My daydreaming had overtaken me until I heard Ethan gasp next to me as we pulled into quite honestly, the most suburban house I've ever seen. The monochromatic color scheme yanked it away from the wooded landscape, the bright white concrete reflected back at you so bright it stung. Nothing out of place, picture perfect. It felt like an adult dollhouse, frozen in time. 

Ethan raced out of the car the minute we stopped, excited to see his new room. 

My dad must have caught my worried gaze as he threw his arm over me comfortably. 

“Hey, love, this house is WAY bigger than the old one aint it? You have your own room, your own space, way nicer neighborhood too, just look at this place! 

He excitedly threw his hand out at the perfectly curved road ahead. Barren of all pets, people, or noise. Just the rows of houses that all looked the same as ours. 

I couldn't help but grin to make him feel better; he wanted to help. But there was something about this place. The silence, the frigid, unforgiving plain houses. Everyone's blinds were shut, no one was walking their dogs, and no kids were playing outside. Besides the over-pampered designer cars in some of the driveways, I would never think anyone lived here at all. 

A sad thought rushed over me as I remembered how fast we left. And how many people I never said goodbye to. 

The frigid breeze slammed into me, as I glanced around and realized the rest of my family was inside. 

As I turn to go in I notice the house next to us, someone has parted the blinds, they’re watching me. As quickly as I had noticed, they pulled back. The hair on my arms stood on end, I brushed it off to the closing winter air and trotted indoors to my family. 

They were all gathered in the glamorous marble kitchen. My dad held a shining smile from ear to ear. Excitedly telling my mother who looked as glazed over as ever what his future plans for the dining room would be. 

He caught my eye. “Teryn! Go check out your new room!”

“Uhhhh, yeh ok”.. 

I responded as I begrudgingly pulled myself up the dark wood stairs. 

The stairs overlooked a huge 2 story living room, with a marble fireplace, And looming windows that swallowed up the space. 

The dark floors contrasted with the stark white walls. Despite all the lights being on, it felt so dark and gloomy. 

I saw Ethan's things in the first bedroom so I opened the next one directly ahead. It was…just a room. I took a large shaky breath in trying to relax and swallow my sadness. The bright street light in front of our house showed the street illuminating all the houses around us as far as the glowing bulb could show. All of them…were dark. Was I right?? Did no one really live here?? I pursed my lips, holding back my thoughts that I had to just run out of this house and never come back. Every nerve in my body felt tense. I had never felt this before, such unease. The constant feeling I was going to be sick. 

To make matters worse, something caught my eye outside. A woman. Walking out of the house next door to us, maybe she was the one watching me before. She seemed to walk with a limp, as if in pain. She looked no older than my mom but walked like my grandma. As if every step was weakening her frail form. She hobbled past the view from the streetlight. I strained my eyes trying to see her direction after. 

I felt a hand on my shoulder and I almost shrieked. My dad's worried eyes met mine. 

“What's wrong? I didn't mean to scare you!” 

I thought about telling him what I just saw but just shrugged as I knew the woman was long gone from view. 

“I wanted to tell you Teryn, your room is downstairs. You can have the master bedroom. You’ll even have your own bathroom all to yourself.”

He could see that I started to question the process-

“Your mom…she wants to keep Ethan…close..”

I nodded, “ok dad…yeah that's fine. Thanks, I guess.” 

I trudged down the stairs. Passing the empty living room. My brother played with his cars on the dusty floor while my mom held his shoulder from behind. She glanced up at me as I walked by, I smiled slightly at her. She averted her eyes and continued absently mindaly watching my brother play. 

The master was larger and had a gaping bay window with a view of the woods behind. In the pitch dark of this evening, and with all the things I had already seen, I quickly threw the dusty blinds closed. 

We had brought our camping gear to stay the first nigh,t as the moving truck would arrive tomorrow. 

I thought back before Ethan was born that my dad and I would go camping for the weekend. He would make the stupidest jokes I’d ever heard and would struggle to light a fire as we got eaten by mosquitoes. But it was some of the best times I remember in my life. I smiled as I drifted off that night. 

I was awoken, I'm assuming a few hours later by heavy footsteps above me. My parents' bedroom. By the tone, It sounded like my parents were arguing, which was nothing new. But after about a minute, I realized I had only heard my dad's voice. My mother hadn't said a word. I brushed it off that he was upset and she was giving him the silent treatment or something.  And covered my ear tight with my hand as I rolled over to get back to sleep. 

In the morning, Ethan eagerly knocked on my door. “Movers are here!”

He was just excited to get his Xbox unloaded as soon as possible. I took my time getting out there. 

As I got out to the truck, my dad was heaving, attempting to lift our furniture out all on his own. I was able to catch the coffee table before it smashed to the ground. 

“God, Dad, where's the movers? Can they help you??” 

“Yeah, not sure love, the truck was just open when I came out. No one inside. Must be on lunch or something-”

“Good Morning!!” 

A bellowing voice nearly caused my dad and me to jump out of our skin. The woman who I recognized as the lady outside last night. Mainly, she was wearing the same clothes. But had seemed to lose her limp. 

“Oh, why you must be Lawerance! And Teryn I presume! Peggy the real estate agent is a dear friend of mine and told me all about the new family we were going to have moving in. We are just so excited to have you!” 

My dad and I made eye contact and he chuckled nervously before turning to her. 

“Ahh yeah…..that's great. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was?” 

“Oh yes, I'm Rita. I live just next door there. She turned to point at her identical home behind her. 

“Peggy mentioned you just had the most gorgeous baby boy as well! Where is he? With his mother, I imagine?” 

My dad's face immediately ditched the fake smile and fell into contention. “Umm, well actually my wife and I lost our son Henry to SIDS 3 weeks ago….I’m sorry, but if Peggy really told you all of this about my family-” 

Rita cut in -“Oh well that's just terrible news! I’m so very sorry, I will be praying for your family, I really should be going now!” As she turned to leave her smile had fallen. But not into sadness, more like disgust or…disappointment.” 

She scuttled off, leaving my dad and me dumbstruck, staring at each other. Neither of us knew what to say. I finally broke the silence. “Dang, these white neighborhoods are something, aren't they Dad?” He mustered a chuckle before his face turned stern once more. “Don't tell your mom about this Teryn, she already has so much she's dealing with” 

I nodded and we finished unloading the moving truck on our own, the moving crew never returned that I saw. Must have been some lunch they were taking. 

My mom had food ready for us and we finally sat down to rest. I cut into my pork chop as my father started questioning me and Ethan about our “excitement” for school tomorrow. I gave my typical nothing answers and left the chatting up to Ethan as I usually did with our family gatherings. 

Until I bit into the pork chop. The texture was normal, but the flavor tasted like it was coated in sugar. I tried to politely keep eating it, until I had to spit it out. My dad was ready to scold me until I saw his eyes widen as well when he took a bite of his. 

“Uhhh, Babe?” “What did you put on this food?” 

My mom stood there like a deer in the headlights. Before looking through all the spices she had pulled out of the boxes. 

“Oh no! I must have mixed up the spices, I just can't read these labels! I think it's time I get glasses finally!!” 

She and my dad shared a light chuckle that died off quickly as they pensively shifted back to staring off in their own worlds. 

I ate what I could of the food but ultimately excused myself early, certainly going to bed hungry that evening. 

Thinking back on this I can't believe that would really be our last real dinner as a family. 

That night the footsteps started again. They were heaving and sounded like someone with heavy boots on was pacing back and forth. It had to be my dad. But at this time of the night why was he up, pacing?. My mom would have to be in the room still, maybe sleeping. Though she was on so many sleeping pills, who even knew what she was capable of hearing? I listened for their voices again, to see if he and my mom were talking. 

I could hear a light voice. That sounded like my dad like he was maybe talking or whispering to himself loudly over and over again. In line with his pacing. As if he was keeping time with his sentences. Right when I was about to roll over to try and get some sleep. I heard him. A voice that wasn't my dad's. 

“Lawrence, What are you going to do?” 

The man's voice said plain as day. I sat bolt-upright in bed. My chest immediately tightened. Who the hell was that??? I almost called out to my dad. But something in my throat closed up. I couldn't even speak if I wanted to. 

I chose to listen. The voice never came again. But the footsteps never stopped. The pacing continued through the whole night. A consistent cadence, nearly becoming background noise as the sun started to peak in from the blinds. 

My eyes were so tired I barely remember getting dressed for school the next day. I was finally expecting to see some life in the neighborhood, as school time encroached I was sure we would see kids rushing out of their homes to make it to the bus stop I was told was at the end of the block. But there was no one. The streets remained silent, just the gentle cold breeze whispering through the woods around us. 

Ethan talked my ear off as per usual. I was too tired to pay attention and before I knew it we were coming to a stop at the end of our lane. I looked around for any other kids coming. No one. As the wind picked up and I braced for it, I noticed the surrounding areas were covered in a thick fog. I hadn't noticed any rain or humidity. Yet you couldn't even see the tops of the ancient trees. 

Ethan tugged on my sleeve, I turned to him, annoyed but he wasn't looking at me. He was staring into the fogged woods opposite where I was looking. He leaned forward inquisitively. “Teryn, how do they know my name?” 

“What??” I shot back.

“I never met them before Teryn, how do they know me?” 

Who the FUCK was they? I froze. 

“Ethan, who are you talking about? There's nothing there-” 

A loud whistle echoed from the fogged trees. Not a summoning whistle like someone calling their dog. A long, drawn-out call. Almost like a warning. I couldn’t breathe, my swallow caught in my throat. We had to get back home. If I could even call it that. 

The surrounding neighborhood had fallen silent, not even the gale of wind. No bugs, no distant highway sounds. Like we were in our own vacuum of the universe.. I just fixed my eyes where Ethan had, looking for anything beyond the fog, any movement. 

The whistle sounded again. This time, deafening, as if it were a beam of sound directed toward us. I grabbed Ethan's hand out of instinct and went to run. In that instant, the bus pulled around the corner behind us and stopped in front of us, the whistle stopping just as fast as it started.  

My heart was racing. I looked at Ethan's worried, fixed stare and had to pose myself for him. I gently nodded at him to get on the bus. 

The trip to the small school was basically a blur. There were a few kids on the bus whose eyes were glued to us the moment we boarded. Ethan stuck to my side and went to turn to look at them but I pulled him back. 

As we pulled up to the school I was relieved to see dozens of other kids of varying ages walking in. It felt so much less lonely. Two people waited outside our bus as it crawled to a stop, holding signs with our names on them. A chipper looking blonde girl held mine, and our weird neighbor Rita held Ethans…

She practically ignored me and was fixated on Ethan as we disembarked. 

“Why, you must be Ethan!!” She greeted him. “I'm Rita, and I’m the leader of fun here at school for all the kids your age!” 

Ethan seemed elated to see a friendly face. 

She finally met my gaze as well. 

“Oh well, hey there Teryn!! I hope your family is settling in just great!” 

“Oh, we're doing fine, thanks.” I tried to sound as confident as I could despite my throat screaming for tears. 

“Well, I’ll take good care of your brother here, and you and Rachel best be making your way to homeroom.”

Rita gestured to the giddy schoolgirl waiting patiently behind my shoulder. 

They walked off hand and hand as Rachel clearly started to introduce herself behind me, I couldnt the slightest begin to listen. I felt like I had a ringing in my ears still from the whistle. What was that! Ethan heard it too. I cant be going crazy!

“HEY!” Rachel finally grabbed my wrist and jolted me back to reality. 

“Girl, you look like something my dad fished in! Did you even get any sleep last night?? New shit is always terrible, man, come with me, I'll show you a chill spot.” 

She still had hold of my wrist and I was in no place to refuse so I trudged aside her. 

“Ar..Aren't we supposed to be heading to a class?” 

“Ahh fuck that.” Rachel laughed, “They don't even know who you are yet we can hang a minute! You're cool to hang right??” 

I uncomfortably laughed and nodded as we wandered into the woods nearest the school. 

Once past the treeline, She plopped down quickly and pulled out a cigarette for herself and handed me one. 

I had never smoked in my life, my grandad did and the whole house always wrecked it. My dad would kill me if he found out later. But Rachel was basically the picturesque version of a teen cover girl model. Was I just supposed to make her think I was a loser on my first day?? 

I swallowed my fears as I puffed on a cigarette silently next to her. Trying to watch how she did it to make it seem like I knew what I was doing. 

“So what brings ya here?” Rachel asked. 

“My dad got a job nearby, apparently,” I responded 

“I thought it was cause your brother died”. She shot back

First Rita, but now this girl. How the fuck does everyone in this town know about my family. 

“Well…That might have been a part of it” “How does everyone here know so much about us-”

“It’s my moms job to know everyone that comes here, she says we only accept the best so you should consider yourself lucky. Wish I could consider myself lucky, she works here at the school with the younger kids so I never catch a break. You saw her earlier, always making me greet the annoying new kids, no offense.” 

She takes a long drag of her cigarette. 

Her mom was Rita?? Our neighbor?? 

How come I hadn't seen her, or anyone besides Rita, for that matter?? 

My chest tightened before I could respond. I only managed a small grin to hide my confusion. Trying to piece together what was going on in this weird ass place. 

This town was scaring the living hell out of me. I didn't know how to place it, but it wasn't right, and I knew it. 

“You know, I’m feeling a little lightheaded. I think I’m gonna get some air, ok?” I shookly said to Rachel. 

“Sure dude, I ain't got shit else to do, I'll be here.”

I stumbled off toward the school, my vision blurring from panic. It felt like my entire world was spinning around me, but my feet were glued to the ground, begging to come undone. 

As I neared the school, I saw a familiar car, my dad's car. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest to begin with, now a new panic set in as I thought over my dad smelling smoke on me. 

As my dad exited the car, his concerned and determined expression erased my fears. 

“Teryn, I came for you and your brother… your mother… she's not doing well.” 

“What…what does that mean Dad??” 

“When she woke up this morning, she couldn't see. The doctors don't know what's wrong at all. I couldn't bear even to ask any more questions. I just came to get you two.” 

“Is…is she going to get her sight back???” I stammered. 

“Don't tell your brother the situation, we need to support her right now while the doctors figure out what's wrong,” Dad said, evading my question. 

The car trip to the hospital was a tizzy; my hysterical dizziness had yet to leave. As my brother sat worried next to me. He went to grab my hand a couple of times, and I jerked away in discomfort. Disgusted at the time to be touched, but in retrospect, disgusted at myself to be so closed off to my baby brother. 

That night, as I sat awake watching my mother's breathing apparatus slide up and down. Bandages lay over her eyes, covering what seemed to be wounds where her eyes were. She really just woke up like that?? 

 I glanced over at my father and brothers, slumped over sleeping bodies. Thinking over the arguing I had been hearing, the footsteps, the mysterious voice. Has someone…done this to her?? 

I immediately shake my negative, sinister thoughts and focus back on my mom. 

Figuring since I couldn't sleep, this would be a great time to start to repeat the prayer my mother had always taught me when I was a kid. 

The moment the first words left my mouth. The footsteps started. 

I stayed frozen, silent, for what felt like an hour. My knees were screaming from the pain of being locked in place. I could hear my heartbeat thud in my ear as I listened for them to start again. They never did. 

I slowly slid my hands out from my mother's and trudged back toward the sterile hospital seating. The moment I took a step. There it was again. 

ThudThud. ThudThud. ThudThud. 

Right above me, in quick cadence as if pacing back and forth, back and forth. 

I turned to look at my mother as the sounds continued, my mouth fell dry as my eyes fell on her heart monitor. The steps above me were in line with her heartbeat. 

What was happening?? My breath was too choked to even speak as I tried to whisper to my dad to wake him. 

“D.. Ddd…Dad”

The thumping became louder above me. More pronounced. 

“Dad!” 

I tried to squeak out in my final attempt to get anyone else to see this. 

The stepping became stomps as the thudding became slams, as if the hits were breaking through the foundation and floors to collapse on top of us. I swore I even heard the beams cracking above me. 

I threw my hands over my ears in the rush of sounds. Tears were welling up and spilling down my face. 

“JUST STOP THIS,” I shrieked out. Now down on my hands and knees on the floor. Unable to even open my eyes through the sting of tears. 

The room fell silent. Nothing left but a ringing in my ears. That was how my mother died. She was the first. ",1,1752762760.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

My leg was going crazy and I was talking pretty fast and I felt electricity in my arms (I do now) and I realized that I haven’t felt this good in ages. While I was driving home I started feeling like my eyes were WIDE open, like I could feel it in the back of my head and I was being pretty reckless (not normal) by texting/spamming one of my friends listing signs and symptoms of why I feel I am possibly hypo right now. I have been staying up a little bit later every night and not falling asleep in the morning again like usual. I impulsively bought a stick n poke set yesterday and saved at least 8 images of ideas that I want to do on myself. I have been getting coffee every day, when normally I get it once or twice a week max, I have been talking a LOT and I was just in a depressive episode and didn’t talk very much. I don’t know what I’m forgetting but I think there’s more. I feel like I’m shaking and my legs are going crazy. I feel like I’m pretty textbook hypo at least right now and I am feeling absolutely amazing. I was just outside and I felt the wind on my arms and the sun on my body and it was the most beautiful sensation ever. Unfortunately I know where this is going to lead if I don’t reach out and stop my medication, but I haven’t felt this good in MONTHS.

I’m trying to remember the name of a mobile cooking game I played a few years ago (maybe 2018–2021). I’ve searched everywhere and can’t find it. Here’s everything I remember:
	•	It was a story-driven cooking game played in landscape (sideways) mode, not portrait like most mobile games.
	•	You could choose your character’s name.
	•	The story starts with the main character moving either in with her aunt and cousin or close to them. Her aunt gives her an apartment, which you can renovate using stars earned from cooking levels.
	•	The first restaurant was an ice cream shop, then later ones included a macaron shop, a sandwich place, and maybe more.
	•	There were pets (like dogs, cats, rabbits) that gave gameplay advantages—for example, a dog that made customers more patient.
	•	I clearly remember a part of the story where a girl is mean to a puppy, and the main character rescues it and takes it home. That’s how the pet system starts.
	•	The game had a town-switching mechanic—after finishing all the restaurants in the first town, the character goes to culinary school, which is another town or area you can access via a button to switch locations.
	•	At the culinary school, I remember the teachers being kind of mean.
	•	You could still go back and replay old levels or continue decorating the original apartment.
	•	You also had to buy and upgrade ovens and meals in each restaurant as you progressed. Like you’d get money from each level and then you’d use it to upgrade the equipment like ovens, coffee makers ect and also the quality of food kinda 

It’s not Delicious World, Cooking Sweet, Cooking Diary, Cooking Fever, or any of the more well-known ones I’ve checked.

If this rings a bell for anyone—especially if you remember the name or icon—please help! 🙏

1m291bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LMCdatingsuccess/comments/1m291bq/too_introverted_to_date_heres_why_and_how_to/,Too Introverted to Date? Here’s Why (and How to Actually Fix It),"If you’re introverted and dating feels impossible, you’re not alone.
Most people think:
• “I’m really shy""
• “I didn’t grow up with alot of friends, so it’s too late now.”
• “I get so awkward, I just can’t hold conversations.”

But here’s what’s really happening beneath it all:
 1. You lacked a social childhood
If you weren’t exposed to frequent social interactions growing up, your brain never wired the social pathways that make small talk, flirting, and conversation flow feel natural.

 2. You have social anxiety
This isn’t introversion itself. Social anxiety is fear-based avoidance rooted in worrying about judgment, rejection, or awkwardness.
3. You’re just shy
Shyness is not introversion. Shyness = fear of social judgment. Introversion = needing time alone to recharge. Many introverts are amazing at dating once they learn conversation skills without draining themselves

 Fix: (Not basic; something you prolly haven’t tried yet)
Try Conversation Stacking:
• For 5 days, whenever you talk to someone (barista, colleague, store clerk), stack 3 layers into your conversation:
• Layer 1: The Surface. Ask or comment about what’s immediately relevant.
Example: “This place is packed today.”


• Layer 2: The Context. Add something about the environment, timing, or shared reality.
Example: “It’s always like this on Fridays. People escaping work early.”
• Layer 3: The Personal Spark. Share a small piece of your personal world or observation.
Example: “I usually avoid coffee shops at this hour, but I needed a caffeine rescue today.”


• Why this works:
• Trains you to keep conversations flowing naturally, not forced.
• Builds conversational agility, the real skill behind dating confidence.
• Doesn’t drain you because you’re not faking extroversion; you’re layering authenticity.

SIDE NOTE: you can also ASK questions instead of saying statements, this initiates conversations (eg: is this placed usually this crowded during this time?) 

 Final Truth:
Being introverted doesn’t stop you from dating. Treat dating as a skill-building journey, not a test of your personality. You don’t need to become an extrovert – you need to become socially agile as an introvert. 

ANOTHER SIDE NOTE: ALOT of people (men & women) find introverts REALLY REALLY CUTE (me too, im an extroverted male, but I think introverted girls are adorable) its just something about how youre so shy and cute. so dont worry, you got this",3,1752762551.0,LMCdatingsuccess,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! David Lynch has always been a favorite director of mine, and I’ve always considered Mulholland Drive to be his magnum opus. After rewatching and analyzing it so many times, I decided to perform a fan edit experiment. I wanted to see the movie in a new light, by experiencing the film in chronological order. To be clear, this is not an edit meant for somebody’s first experience with the movie, this is meant for anyone wanting to rewatch it and experience it in a different way, uncover hidden details, and hopefully get something new out of Lynch’s surreal masterpiece.

What’s Different in This Edit? Not too many, as the film needs no fixing. But here’s the gist:

1.) Everything Before the Credits:
The film starts with the Jitterbug competition like it does before transitioning to Diane’s chronological flashbacks with Camilla. We see their passionate but tumultuous relationship, building up to Camilla sending Diane a limo. This goes into the iconic opening credits and music.

2.) From Reality To The Dream: 
The opening credits roll into Diane arriving at the party and it plays out as it does. Diane ordering the hit at Winky’s transitions into her going to sleep and the dream beginning. In place of the credits, we have just the shorter driving scene. The rest of the movie plays out as it, until the dream ends and the Cowboy wakes her up.

3.) Back To Reality: 
Diane awakens to find the blue key on her coffee table and begins to quickly go mad reaizing what she did. This transitions to The Bum scene from after Diane’s earlier Winky’s scene and this plays out the same all the way to the tragic end of the movie.

If you’re curious about exploring Lynch’s boundless masterstroke in a new way OR if you just didn’t understand the film and need to see the narrative told straightforward, I’d love for you to check it out!

It went really well we had coffee, talked, and went for a walk. We are both Christian with marriage as the goal. In total we've been on 5 dates. The one on July 4th, then we went to the park and walked/talked a few times and once we drove around town in his car. We've been texting in between and even had a couple deep conversations. He says he's very happy we're able to have such deep conversations. 

We've known each other a little over a week and we've been talking about our future goals and values and they align. We both want marriage and kids and have the same lifestyle and interests. I really like him as a person and I like spending time with him. He says he likes spending time with me. He says he thinks about what it would be like if we were married and it's a really big deal to pursue a girl for marriage. Does that mean he's thinking about me as his wife and that's what he wants? I also feel like it's very early and we need time to get to know each other. How much time is enough? 3 weeks? A month? 2 months? Before we're in a relationship? He told me he wants to be able to deeply communicate and I told him I want go know him on a deeper level and he said he trusts me and will give me the time I need. He says he feels a responsibility to me. What does he mean by that?

After our last date on Monday night which was just walking and talking in the park I kind of felt like he was less interested? I want to show I'm interested but I'm not sure how. Should I initiate touch, holding hands, hugs? His love language is physical touch and we held hands on the 2nd date but I wasnt comfortable with that yet. I feel like I'm ready to show more physical touch now. I want to be able to show interest but I want to know how he's feeling about me but idk how to bring it up. We haven't texted all day Tuesday or Wednesday. Is he uninterested now or should I wait until the end of the week to see if he texts? Should I follow his Instagram or just do nothing and wait to see if he texts me? If I do text him something what should I say?",1,1752762433.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Basically, you just type what you need — like:

- “Make me a TikTok video about how to makemoney with PDFs”
- “Design a logo and brand kit for a coffee shop”
- “Create an app UI for a habit tracker”

…and it actually does it.  
Like, full designs. With voiceovers. Editable layers. Videos.  
All from one prompt.

I used it to create stuff that would normally take me hours in Canva, Figma, or ChatGPT + other tools.

It’s still in private beta, but I’ve got a few invite codes.

If you wanna try it, just comment **“access”** and I’ll DM you.

It’s free for now — and honestly, it’s kinda nuts what it can do.",0,1752761860.0,SideProject,4,0.22,False
1m28q61,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1m28q61/6_year_old_yorkie_recently_adopted_dog_resource/,6 year old Yorkie Recently adopted - dog resource guarding,"My boyfriend and I recently adopted a 6 year old dog from a rescue organization. He has now been with us for about 2 weeks and a half so we are aware that it is all very recent and I’m sure he is still trying to get adjusted to us as we are to him. 

We have noticed some resource guarding behaviors, ex: we can’t pet him while he eats  or he will growl, if we touch near his food bowl while he eats he will growl, and when we placed him on our bed a week ago he was growling and barking refusing to letting us carry him off and trying to bite us. (He is unable to jump on and off himself so he needed to be carried off) 

Last night, he bit my boyfriend after he had grabbed some food we left on our coffee table and when my partner tried to stop him he bit him hard this time. It did not break skin. This is the worst that he has reacted with us yet.

My boyfriend and I are in our late 20’s and we are not yet in higher paying position in our careers. We are unsure at this time if we would be able to afford lots of training and we would like to one day grow our family and have kids. No timeline on that but we know we want kids at some point. 

With our dog’s behaviors we are worried about that future and we are worried about the present. I’m a first time dog owner and the growling has me quite shaken up that I am sometimes afraid of him and have been stressed out immensely these past couple of days. It is also upsetting for us to know that based on the fosters description of him she never mentioned any aggressiveness and he seemed to be a really sweet dog. He allowed her to put in his eye drops with no issues and he won’t let us at all, even with treats. We gave him cream cheese for 2 days and now he caught on and will hide. I would appreciate any advice, but currently we are unsure when should we have to start thinking about the possibility that we might not be the right match for him? Is that a thing? I don’t want to feel like I’m just giving up so quick. ",1,1752761802.0,reactivedogs,1,1.0,False
