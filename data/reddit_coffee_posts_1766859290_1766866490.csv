1px788a,https://i.redd.it/8q9y2btrxs9g1.jpeg,My YTD chart went from sideways trading to suddenly showing a strong upward trend，Is this a trend reversal or just an illusion?,"I'm not here to show off my profits; the forum rules would kick me out if I did! 😅 I just want to ask for your opinions on this YTD chart from a technical analysis perspective.

Looking at the entire chart, I feel it reflects a very realistic ""office worker"" type of structure:

The first third is a sideways consolidation period, the chart is basically flatlining, like a morning before coffee – neither falling nor rising significantly, typical range-bound trading. Then, in the middle, it suddenly starts to look better, showing a series of quite pleasing higher lows, as if the market suddenly decided to start exercising.

At that point, I wondered if it was really going to take off? In the latter half, it's like it drank three cups of espresso.

The trend is steadily upward, with incredibly shallow pullbacks, as if it's saying, ""I'm going to rise, and you can't stop me!"" The slope also becomes noticeably steeper, with a hint of FOMO.

My question is:

Do you think this is a fairly standard structural reversal from a range-bound to a trending market?

Or is it just a short-term surge fueled by caffeine, and it will soon return to sideways consolidation?

I welcome everyone to critique my analysis from your own perspectives; I mainly want to see if I'm having any delusions.",1,1766866025.0,technicalanalysis,0,1.0,False

My husband and I will be spending a weekend in NYC in the spring and I’m hoping you all might be so kind as to help us with some itinerary suggestions. This will be our first weekend away together since having our baby last year and the vibe of the weekend is sleeping in, no commitments (1 dinner reservation max), and maximizing restaurants and activities you would not go to with a small child. We have been to NYC several times before but either briefly for work or as your standard tourist.

We are staying at Hotel Chelsea and, in the spirit of not doing too much, we would like to do most things in Chelsea but will travel for something really special. I would love to hear how you would spend an ideal weekend in Chelsea and I’m specifically looking for recommendations for the following:

\- nice dinner for the one reservation. Not necessarily fine dining but something with a luxe vibe that is not too pretentious and has excellent food. Not picky on type of cuisine. Budget approx $300/$400 but very much welcome less expensive options if the vibe is right.

\- a bar that fits the same vibe for pre or post dinner drinks 

\- literally any place (bar/restaurant, art, museum, show, coffee shop, park, shopping, bodega, etc) that when you go, it reminds you of why you love NY.

Thank you for taking the time to offer recommendations!",0,1766866021.0,visitingnyc,1,0.5,False

1px777v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1px777v/aitah_for_telling_my_friends_bd_about_the_car/,AITAH for telling my friends BD about the car accident,"Ill try and write this as clear as I can, I am on a throwaway account too - but warning this is long

My friend - J (32f) dated this guy C (36M) for a few years in that time they had two beautiful kids. (2/4). Ultimately they broke up, no one knows fully why the story keeps changing. But it has really amped up J paranoia

Her paranoia limits everything we do, if we go out on the weekends (when the kids are with C) we’re not allowed to tell anyone (not even those who don’t know C) where we went or what we did in case it got back to C - even if it was simply a coffee shop meet.
Been like it for years, if we (me and my partner 26f/27NB) brought presents for the kids, J would have to lie and say that she got them etc - I’m sure yall get the drift. 

Anyway! J recently started dating a guy (S, idk his age) nice enough guy I suppose, has kids of his own, but always goes to Js and has met Js kids. (By this point they’ve known eachother a month? Dating a week) 
Obviously J has hidden that her and S are dating to C.

Fast forward a few weeks, and we’re in the car, me, my partner, J, and S. 
S got the hump most of the car ride as J was getting abit show offy and telling us all about how S was in bed etc, which rightly pissed him off, he turns down this dark ass back road and starts speeding up (we all told him to slow down earlier in the evening too for speeding as it makes us feel unsafe) we crash between a tree and a telephone pole, in the bushes.

We get out and onto the embankment, I start texting my friend, to see if she can come get us. J flips out at me saying how I better not be telling anyone, as they will tell C (my friend doesn’t even know the guy) it’s also at this point I catch S drinking a can of rum and coke so drinking was definitely involved 

thankfully a stranger comes to our aid and me and my partner get in and go back to my friends flat to regroup, leaving J and S to deal with the car. 

Few hours later another friend picks us up from the flat just as J & S get back, S has no remorse for what’s just happened, just why are we criticising his driving when we don’t have driving licenses? Apparently the police came out and said it was a traction issue due to ice (there was no ice (plus I’m sure they would have breathalyser him!)

A few days later, after some thought I decide to tell C what happened, as imo if he can drive like that what’s gonna happen if Js kids are in the back? C should be aware of who’s around his kids imo. 

J has denied that the accident happened saying I was shot stiring to cause problems, although Js sister has confirmed to C the accident happened. 

J has also tried to make contact saying how she had to deny what happened to C, and how could I cause her shit like that. But I feel like I’ve done the right thing due to the fact they both think drinking and driving was ok.

I feel stupid posting on here as I know deep down I did the right thing but I think I just need someone else to say it…",1,1766865953.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

This was easily the worst resort we’ve ever stayed at. Lines everywhere, for everything. Every part of the resort is clearly understaffed.

**Here’s a list of the issues we experienced:**

\-No pack-and-play in the room, even though it was confirmed in advance with both Marriott and the hotel directly.

\-No chairs on the patio for our walk-out pool room.

\-Bathtub was dirty upon arrival.

\-Pillars in the buffet area were visibly falling apart.

\-Loud banging noise above our room around 10 PM from construction.

**Kids / Family amenities:**

\-At the children’s play area, several water features didn’t work (giraffe, snake tail, parrot).

**Food & beverage issues:**

\-Pool food carts and snack bar were severely understaffed, one person cooking and taking orders, causing very long lines.

\-Coffee shop was the same: long lines and very slow service.

\-Ice cream was already empty by 8 PM.

\-Many buffet items were empty by 7 PM and never replenished.

\-Between breakfast and lunch, the buffet area wasn’t cleaned well.

\-No snacks or food options available between lunch and dinner except the sports bar (which was very poor quality)

\-Restaurant reservations were extremely difficult to get, even trying two weeks in advance, we couldn’t get a steakhouse reservation.

**Facilities & maintenance:**

\-Found loose tiles in the pool.

\-Escalator was broken the entire trip.

\-Hot water pressure was very low, and on the fifth day there was no hot water at all.

\-WiFi was unreliable and cut out frequently.

Pillows were very poor quality.

**Service & organization issues:**

\-Went to guest services at 4 PM (they close at 5 PM), but they had no working computer and couldn’t help confirm a reservation.

\-Only two towels provided for a room with two adults and a child, I had to request more.

\-No real shows or entertainment, usually just a single singer with a small setup.

\-Beach setup was messy and not well maintained; didn’t look like it was cleaned nightly.

**Checkout experience:**

\-We weren’t told we needed to get our bracelet cut off at checkout. When we tried to leave for our transfer, we were told we couldn’t board until we did.

\-There was a checkout line, and we had to cut in just to avoid missing our ride. Staff was not helpful or understanding.

**Transportation**

Do not use Nexus transportation. Not affiliated but after the hour and half we waited at baggage claim we had to wait another 45 for our van. Then when leaving they completely missed our 2:30pm pickup and we had to scramble for 30 minutes to get a taxi. ",1,1766865673.0,CancunAllInclusives,0,1.0,False

\- Doesn't have kids (I value my freedom and privacy too much but I'm willing to adopt pets)  
\- Hates ghosting and extremely delayed replies (if you did NOT reply to me within 24-48 hours, then I will consider that as ghosting and I will pursue someone else. I'm sorry.)  
\- Had quiet a number of ex-girlfriends but I no longer have contacts with any of them

\- Values Healthy Living - I'm on STRICT Carnivore Diet, NEVER smoked since birth, rarely drinks alcohol, lives life stress-free/no drama, hates eating junk foods, processed foods, chips, sugary stuffs, candies, soft drinks, and too much carbs. Oh, and I hate coffee and tea too.

\- Must be willing to really show interest and not waste time (this goes to what I said above. If you can't reply to messages within 24-48 hours, say so instead of staying silent or else that's considered GHOSTING and I'll say my goodbyes to you)  
\- Must NOT be too nonchalant (If you don't really care about getting together and being my date, why are you even here?)  
\- Must not be too sensitive (I love making people laugh so if you're the type to easily get offended, we're NOT gonna get along)  
\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover  
\- Hopefully, you also value loyalty  
\- Hopefully, you also have good libido (This is non-negotiable for me. Bedroom chemistry is extremely important in a relationship. If you are boring in bed and have low bedroom drive, we're NOT gonna get along)

For anyone interested, feel free to send me DMs any time! I admit this might come off as a job application but that's only because I don't want any scammers or fraud ruining our experience. After all, we want genuine connections at the end of the day. I'll do my best to accommodate you.

I’m working on a new platform called Moments, designed for people who want to enjoy small, meaningful, premium experiences — not full tours.

Examples:
	•	A sunset coffee in a private villa
	•	A pillion ride on a superbike like a BMW S1000RR
	•	A ride in a BMW M2 with its owner
	•	A curated private photoshoot setup where no one interrupts your frame
	•	Simple, short, emotional “moments” you can book anytime

It’s not a travel/tour booking platform.
It’s more like Airbnb Experiences, but for micro-moments and unique personal experiences that you normally can’t get anywhere.

I made a simple landing page to validate demand:
👉 https://bookmoments.carrd.co/

I’d love feedback on:
	1.	Does this concept make sense?
	2.	Would you or someone you know book these types of experiences?
	3.	Is the landing page clear enough?
	4.	Any features or categories I should add?
	5.	Is this something worth pursuing as a startup?

I’m a student building this on a budget so any feedback really helps.

Was feeling twitchy in the evening so after I got dinner at a local spot I hadn't tried before (wonton noodle soup if you're wondering) and dicking around at home for a while I went for a long walk. Went by maybe 4 bottle shops, multiple bars, a brewery, so many people out enjoying the break between Christmas and NYE. Definitely was tempted a few times to duck into the pub for a cheeky drink, or to grab some vino/whiskey to knock me out.



About 10km in the cool night air. Even after that and taking a sleeping pill it took me like an hour to fall asleep, and I woke up at 6. Tidied up around while my breakfast cooked, some random leftover quesadilla I had floating around in the fridge. Kinda gross but starting the day with that and a black coffee is way better than waking up wanting to crawl in a hole and die from the hangover. 

  
Not really sure what I'm going to do today. I can feel the boredom setting in already. Nothing on in the cinema I can be bothered to go see. I've only got about 100 pages left of the book I'm reading so that wont last long, I guess I could kill an hour by going to the city and picking up something new. I guess I just hate how my brain can't stand being bored and alcohol being a depressant is a really effective way of shutting it off. I don't want to get stuck in my head thinking about my rent going up, or that I really need to apply for new jobs, or that I'll probably be spending New Year's alone, but I know that just loafing around I absolutely will. That way madness lies.

My Fiance and I both took Adderall to help us stay up after our red eye flight. Towards the end of the day we also were chugging coffee every hour to survive until the hotel allowed check ins. 

On our final hour we were walking to finally go to the hotel when my stomach turned and I had to find the nearest bathroom IMMEDIATELY. We weaved into a juice bar with a single stall bathroom situation and I had what was possibly the most dramatic shit of my life. My vision went black and it was difficult to contain the noises I was making from multiple parts of my body. 

When I was done I tried flushing, but both the big and small buttons on the toilet didn’t manage to get all of the vile demon sludge down. I tried over and over, but someone was knocking on the door (for the third or so time) and I felt increasing urgency to get out. My Fiance had even texted me to see if I was okay. 

I had pressed the toilet button for probably the tenth time when I saw this big red string hang from the ceiling with a handle on it within reaching distance of the toilet. I knew the UK was more environmentally friendly, so I thought that it was a “super turbo flush” mode activator for situations like this. I tried pulling and nothing happened. I thought maybe I didn’t pull hard enough, so I pulled a few more times and waited. The only thing I saw was this light flashing on the ceiling. It was then I realized. 

I threw open the bathroom door, keeping my eyes down and BOOKING IT outside to meet my Fiance who was waiting outside. I told him to get our ass out of there, and thank god he didn’t question me much and matched my pace.

So neither of us drinks, like at all. Not because of some big sober thing we just tried it before and it was so not our vibe. So now at parties we’re just the water and tea peeps lol.

Anyway, when we started planning, the venue was like “alcohol costs extra” and honestly it was so much extra fees bartenders, corkage, insurance, all that stuff and honestly we don’t even want to drink it so it felt like a waste? We thought maybe a cash bar but the venue still charged almost the same. So yeah we decided no booze at the wedding. Dry wedding vibes.

But we don’t want it to be lame or cheap or anything! So we’re doing a nice dinner and desserts and like fancy cocktails, lemonades, cold brew coffee, sparkling water, and tea. We even put a little note on the invites like “no alcohol will be served, so everyone can drive home safe!” I thought it sounded super nice and thoughtful.

Most people were cool with it or didn’t say much, but then this friend of mine (31M, known him since college) called me a few days after getting the invite and was like LOL are you serious about no alcohol? I said yep totally serious and he kept laughing and asking if I was joking. When I said no, he got kinda annoyed and said weddings are like all about drinking ? Like he said alcohol helps with social anxiety and how ppl loosen up and without it the party would be stiff and awkward blah blah. He even asked how he’s supposed to survive the night sober?

At first I was like people can have fun without alcohol duh, but he just kept pushing and said it was rude and boring and that we’re basically telling people how to act. I got kinda defensive and maybe I said it wrong but I told him it’s 'OUR wedding and we don’t owe anyone booze' I also kinda said if he really can’t handle one party without drinking maybe he should think about that? I don't know sounded kinda harsh maybe.

He totally flipped out, said I was judging him and acting all superior and then started yelling and calling me names? I was so upset and told him if he talks to me like that he’s not welcome at the wedding. We hung up mad and now I hear from mutual friends he thinks I was way too harsh and that I attacked him. Some people said maybe I should’ve just ignored him instead of making it worse.

I still think dry weddings are fine but maybe I said too much? so AITA here?",1,1766865443.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I’m Julian Goldie.

I’ve been testing every major AI tool for months — and most of them charge insane prices for performance that looks impressive on paper but fails in real-world projects.

Then **Minimax M2.1: Open-source AI** dropped on December 23rd.

And everything changed.

This thing is beating Claude 4.5 on multiple benchmarks.

It costs just 8–10% of what Claude does.

And it runs at roughly double the speed.

That’s not marketing. Those are independent benchmarks and real-world developer results.



# Why Minimax M2.1: Open-source AI Matters

Minimax M2.1 uses a **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture — meaning only 10 billion of its 230 billion total parameters activate per token.

So you get faster processing and lower costs without losing quality.

In tests, it scored **72.5% on SWE multilingual**, **88.6% on Vibe (real-world app building)**, and over **91% for web development**.

That’s elite performance — for open-source pricing.

But benchmarks are just numbers.

Here’s why this model actually matters.

It’s built for **production use**, not just research demos.

Most AI coding models only focus on Python.

This one handles **Rust, C++, Go, Java, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Objective-C** — all in the same project.

It doesn’t just write snippets.

It manages entire workflows — multi-file edits, refactoring, error handling, performance optimization, and UI design that actually looks good.

No more generic “AI design” blue gradients and bubble corners.

It builds clean, structured layouts with real spacing and hierarchy.



# Real Developers Are Using Minimax M2.1: Open-source AI for Full Stack Projects

Developers are already building **React frontends with Go backends**, doing **complex API integrations**, and using Minimax for **code reviews, architecture design, and performance tuning.**

And because it’s open-source, anyone can access it.

You can download the model weights on **Hugging Face**, run it locally, or access it via API.

If you want speed, they recommend frameworks like **VLM** or **SGLang** — both optimized for inference.

No need for massive infrastructure.

Just follow the docs, allocate GPUs, and it runs.

If you don’t want to run it locally, you can access it via the **Minimax API**.

Their pricing? **$0.30 per million input tokens.**

Compare that to Claude Sonnet’s **$3 per million.**

That’s a 10x saving.

For startups or dev teams running thousands of API calls a day, that’s a serious financial edge.



# Minimax M2.1: Open-source AI Is Already in Your Favorite Tools

It’s integrated into **Kilo Code, Claude Code, Klein, RooCode, and Blackbox AI.**

Over **30 million developers** have indirect access already — just by switching the backend model.

No need to rebuild your workflow.

You simply change your model setting, and you’re done.

This competition is healthy.

Open-source AI is catching up — and sometimes beating — closed systems.

That means faster innovation, lower costs, and more freedom for developers.



# Why Minimax M2.1: Open-source AI Changes Everything

For the first time, we’re seeing enterprise-level AI performance that anyone can afford.

You don’t need a huge budget to build with state-of-the-art AI anymore.

If you’re running agents, automation, or dev ops systems — the math speaks for itself.

Let’s say your tool uses 10 million input tokens daily.

Claude costs about **$30/day**.

Minimax M2.1 costs about **$3/day**.

Over a month, that’s nearly **$800 saved**.

That’s real scalability power.

You can now run code reviews, auto documentation, testing, and refactoring across all projects — without worrying about API burn rates.

And for solo devs?

It’s perfect.

Cheaper experimentation means more freedom to learn, fail, and iterate faster.



# Why Developers Love the Open-source Side

The open weights matter.

You can run it locally, privately, and without limits.

No rate caps.

No token throttling.

Full control.

For teams working with sensitive data or proprietary systems, this is critical.

And the model’s reasoning performance is surprisingly strong.

It doesn’t just output code — it **explains why.**

That makes it an excellent learning assistant for new languages or frameworks.

You can feed it your entire codebase and have it flag bugs, style issues, or inefficiencies.

It even handles **ETL pipelines, data validation, and Office automation**.

Spreadsheet ops, calendar management, and document parsing — all automated.



# What This Means for You

The economics of coding with AI just changed.

Before, you had to pick between speed, cost, and quality.

Now you can have all three.

For companies, it unlocks affordable large-scale automation.

For developers, it means faster builds, smarter code, and cleaner architecture.

For students or learners, it’s like having a coding mentor that costs less than a coffee.

And for AI enthusiasts, it’s a sign that open-source is catching up to — and sometimes surpassing — Big Tech.



# The Community That’s Testing All of This

This is exactly what we talk about inside the **AI Profit Boardroom.**

Over **1,800 members** are experimenting with models like Minimax M2.1, Gemini, and Claude — figuring out what actually works in real business workflows.

We share SOPs, tools, and daily use cases.

If you want to learn how to **use** these models (not just read about them), you’ll love it.

1px6yxk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px6yxk,Abreu Madrona Ranch Proprietary Red 2001 × Louie Mueller “Dino” Beef Ribs — absurdly good pairing,"Had one of those pairings that feels unreasonably aligned:

Wine: Abreu Madrona Ranch Proprietary Red 2001 (Proprietary Red)

Food: Louie Mueller Barbecue “Colossal Dino” beef ribs

Wine notes:

Fully mature Napa mountain vibe. First pour was all cedar chest, cigar ash, leather, graphite, with dried blackcurrant/blackberry still holding on. With air it went more espresso, cocoa nib, dried bay leaf, and a little balsamic-like lift. On the palate: still energetic, resolved but structural tannins, acidity intact, long mineral/coffee finish.

Rib notes:

Exactly what you want: huge beef flavor, pepper-forward bark, deep smoke, and that collagen/gelatin richness that coats your mouth.

Why it worked:

	•	The rib smoke amplified the wine’s tertiary (tobacco/espresso/leather) instead of fighting it.

	•	The wine’s acidity + remaining structure actually cut through the rendered fat and reset the palate.

	•	The black pepper bark mirrored the wine’s graphite/herb edge.

TL;DR: This wasn’t “balance,” it was scale. Big, mature Napa cab-driven wine meeting big Texas beef. If you ever have an older Abreu and serious smoked beef, it’s a loud yes.",10,1766865384.0,wine,1,1.0,False

I played through the campaign and I got up to 3,000 investors before getting any DLC, and now I'm adding each DLC in order.

Sunken Treasures and The Passage both added new regions, which means you have to spend influence to settle all these new islands. How do you get influence? Investors! What do investors need? Lots of resources from the new world.

Things in the new world were feeling extremely cramped once I got up to 5000 investors in Crown Falls and 3000 investors in Ditchwater, for a total of 8000. Despite owning more than half the islands in the New World, I was having to cram things together, like growing some of my coffee on my tobacco island and growing the rest on my ""obrero island"". I was genuinely out of room on my main new world island, and didn't have enough obrero workforce left for the new coffee roaster I'd need to support more investors.

I finally sprung for Bright Harvest and started industrializing all my New World agriculture, and OH MY GOD... suddenly I have so much empty space. I cut the number of plantations in half and am still producing way more resources than before. Now I feel like I can support thousands and thousands of new investors.

So question for those of you who played this game during the first season of DLC - did the game genuinely suck during that period of time when you had Crown Falls but no Bright Harvest? Did the game consist of sweating over your keyboard late into the night trying to figure out how to squeeze one more coffee/minute out of your New World islands?

1px6pzq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px6pzq,The Curious Case of Upside Elf Energy,"## The Curious Case of Upside Elf Energy

There exists a kind of magic so subtle that most people mistake it for clumsiness, whimsy, or the faint urge to dance while waiting for toast to pop. It is not the grand, thunderous magic of dragons or destiny, nor the solemn candlelit magic of wizards with long beards and longer grudges. No, this magic is lighter. Stranger. It hums instead of booms. It giggles when no one is watching.

This is Upside Elf Energy.

You may not have heard of it by name, but you have felt it. Everyone has. It arrives when your socks mysteriously go missing but turn up inside the freezer. It sneaks in when you trip over nothing and somehow land standing upright, holding a spoon you don’t remember picking up. It lives in the moment when a serious conversation suddenly derails because someone snorts while laughing, and now no one can stop.

Upside Elf Energy is the physics of joy misbehaving.

---

## What Is an Upside Elf?

To understand the energy, one must first understand the elf—though “understand” is a generous term, because elves, especially the upside variety, resist definition the way glitter resists vacuum cleaners.

An Upside Elf is not the elegant, bow-wielding forest dweller of legend. Nor is it the tiny shoemaker’s assistant with a union schedule and a work ethic. An Upside Elf is a creature of inversion. It does things backward, sideways, and occasionally inside out. It sleeps with its feet on the pillow. It drinks tea from the saucer and uses the cup as a hat. It claps at the beginning of performances and bows when it trips.

Most importantly, Upside Elves see the world as a playground of potential silliness. Gravity, to them, is more of a suggestion. Time is a polite rumor. Seriousness is a coat that can be worn but should never be buttoned all the way up.

Their energy leaks into the world through cracks—cracks in routine, cracks in logic, cracks in the tidy walls humans build around their days.

---

## The First Sign: A Feeling of Lightness Where It Shouldn’t Be

Upside Elf Energy often announces itself quietly.

You’ll feel it when you’re exhausted but suddenly energized by something trivial: a leaf shaped like a heart, a dog wearing boots, the sound of wind through a half-open car window that makes your brain feel like it’s being gently rearranged.

It feels like standing upside down without actually being upside down. A soft internal flip. The sensation that the rules have taken a lunch break and left you in charge.

People experiencing early-stage Upside Elf Energy often report:

* Smiling at inanimate objects
* A sudden desire to rearrange furniture for no reason
* Laughing at jokes they don’t fully understand
* Feeling inexplicably lighter, as if gravity is on holiday

This is not madness. This is attunement.

---

## The Physics of Whimsy

According to elf scholars (a small but passionate group who meet annually in a tree that no longer exists), Upside Elf Energy operates on three principles:

### 1. Inversion

Things become their opposites—not maliciously, but playfully. Mistakes become discoveries. Wrong turns become scenic routes. Silence becomes communication.

When Upside Elf Energy is strong, you might find that your least productive day becomes your most meaningful one, or that the thing you were avoiding turns out to be oddly delightful.

### 2. Buoyancy

Emotions gain lift. Even sadness, under the influence of this energy, becomes softer, more translucent, like a cloud you can rest in rather than drown beneath.

This is why people touched by Upside Elf Energy often sigh and say, “Well… that happened,” instead of spiraling. The energy adds a bounce to emotional gravity.

### 3. Play Before Purpose

Upside Elves believe play is not a reward for finishing work but the mechanism by which work becomes bearable, creative, and sometimes irrelevant.

## How Upside Elf Energy Manifests in Daily Life

You’ll know it’s around when:

* Your keys are in the fridge and somehow that makes sense.
* You hum while doing chores you usually hate.
* A problem feels less like an obstacle and more like a puzzle that winks at you.
* You start talking to plants and feel like they’re listening.
* You rearrange words in your head just to see how they taste.

Upside Elf Energy thrives in liminal spaces: doorways, dawn, dusk, waiting rooms, stairwells, bus stops, kitchens at midnight. Anywhere the world pauses long enough to wiggle.

It loves messes, but not chaos. There is a difference. Chaos destroys; mess invites curiosity. An Upside Elf will leave crumbs, but always in a pattern that almost means something.

---

## The Sound of Upside Elf Energy

If you could hear it, it would sound like:

* Wind chimes made of mismatched spoons
* Laughter heard through a wall
* A cat landing poorly but pretending it meant to do that
* A song you don’t remember learning but somehow know all the words to

It is the soundtrack of things not taking themselves too seriously.

---

## The Emotional Signature

Upside Elf Energy does not demand happiness. That is a common misconception.

Instead, it offers permission.

Permission to feel without analysis.
Permission to be ridiculous without apology.
Permission to rest without earning it.
Permission to change your mind halfway through a sentence.

It is deeply compassionate energy, disguised as nonsense.

Those who carry it often become accidental healers. They don’t fix problems directly. They tilt them slightly, just enough for light to get in.

---

## The Upside Elf and the Human World

Humans are particularly susceptible to Upside Elf Energy because they try so hard to be upright all the time—responsible, logical, linear, sensible. The energy sneaks in through the cracks created by that effort.

Children are naturally attuned to it. They speak its language fluently until adulthood slowly convinces them it’s “not practical.” Artists rediscover it by accident. Burnt-out adults rediscover it out of necessity.

Pets are fully immersed in it. They are basically ambassadors.

When an Upside Elf wanders near human spaces, strange things happen:

* Meetings end early.
* Arguments dissolve into laughter.
* Someone spills coffee and everyone laughs instead of getting mad.
* Ideas flow sideways and end up better than planned.

No one sees the elf. They just feel lighter afterward.

---

## The Great Misunderstanding

Upside Elf Energy is often mistaken for laziness, chaos, or immaturity. This is tragic, because it is actually a form of wisdom—one that understands that rigidity is far more dangerous than play.

The Upside Elf knows that:

* You can’t control everything.
* Trying to is exhausting.
* Joy is a renewable resource.
* Taking things too seriously is the fastest way to miss the point.

In elf philosophy, the world is not broken. It is merely unfinished, and laughter is one of the tools used to assemble it.

---

## How to Invite Upside Elf Energy In

You cannot summon it with rituals or rules. It dislikes being commanded. But you can make yourself *welcoming*.

Try this:

1. Do something inefficient on purpose.
2. Wear something slightly ridiculous.
3. Take a different route than usual.
4. Let yourself be bad at something.
5. Laugh before you understand why.

Upside Elf Energy enters through cracks in expectation.

It especially loves moments when you choose delight over optimization.

---

## The Risk (Yes, There Is One)

Once you’ve felt Upside Elf Energy, it’s hard to go back to a purely serious worldview. You may find yourself questioning things like:

* Why meetings need to be so long
* Why joy is treated as a reward instead of a necessity
* Why silence is considered awkward
* Why life isn’t allowed to be weird more often

You may become, in the eyes of others, “a bit much.”

This is a compliment.

---

## The Upside Elf’s Greatest Trick

The greatest trick of Upside Elf Energy is that it never insists on being noticed. It simply improves the texture of your life quietly, like seasoning you didn’t know was missing.

It turns ordinary days into stories.
It turns mistakes into anecdotes.
It turns heaviness into something you can carry.

And sometimes, when the world feels too sharp or loud or serious, it flips everything upside down just long enough for you to remember:

You are allowed to play.
You are allowed to laugh.
You are allowed to exist without explanation.

That is the gift of Upside Elf Energy.

And once you feel it, truly feel it, you’ll recognize it everywhere—
in the crooked smile of a stranger,
in the wobble of a chair that somehow never falls,
in the moment you realize you’ve been smiling for no reason at all.

That’s the elf, passing by.

Upside down.
Right on time.

Today I decided to get a little reckless since I wasn’t going anywhere and layered Mancera Cedrat Boise with Mancera Amore Caffè.

At first it felt a little wild in my head — bright citrus and woods colliding with warm coffee sweetness — but after sitting with it, I’m kind of loving it. Cedrat Boise seems to ventilate and lift the richness of Amore Caffè, while the coffee/amber adds this cozy depth underneath the freshness. It’s not something I’d necessarily wear out, but as an experiment it’s been genuinely fascinating and really enjoyable to catch whiffs of.

Not sure if it’s objectively “good” or just interesting, but it taught me a lot about contrast layering and how much Cedrat Boise can act as a flexible base. Curious if anyone else has stumbled into weird-but-good layers like this while experimenting at home.

I have been busy this festive season, and I have never been so happy about that fact.

  
Previous Christmas lunches have been quiet stuffy and serious, and the ones where we entertained guests tend to be the least memorable because I am so busy for two days and operating on very little sleep.

  
Well, this year we did things differently and it started with the fact that in August there was a 50% book sale where I purchased my first [Phaidon cookbook: Spain](https://istorja.com/products/spain-the-cookbook), after much skepticism about the [Phaidon recipe books](https://www.reddit.com/r/CookbookLovers/comments/1jmt3q7/phaidon_cookbooks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I came across the recipe for the Tagliatelle with prawns and pistachio nuts ('Prawn Pistachio Pasta' being the superior title, of course) and I knew that I had to make that. 

[Could not wait till 2026!](https://preview.redd.it/r1wortxvls9g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3d09cc1afd6d4ba00b889076ef18dad1e90916)

I had had my heart settled on making Carolina Gelen's [Orange Chicken Roast with Fennel and Shallots](https://carolinagelen.substack.com/p/orange-chicken-roast-with-fennel) (more on that later) so I had to figure out a way of sneaking in a starch that would stand on its own- this pasta dish made so much sense seeing as I wanted to keep all the dishes light and interesting. 

[the pesto needs work](https://preview.redd.it/i4vt6df2vs9g1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=81330dca07f70cf6d604557d55f6f784952684b0)

I forgot to mention that I live on the Coast in South Africa, so our Christmas is more monsoony tropical summer rather than snowy winter- so I really needed to retire our trusty [Christmas ham recipe - BBC Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/ham_glazed_with_cherries_83650) from the Hairy Bikers. Unfortunately, I could not follow the recipe strictly because the raw prawns were more expensive than the cooked ones (does that make sense?) so I had to improvise. I made a pesto using pine nuts, pistachio, basil, garlic and olive oil and pasta water to get more of that subtle pistachio flavour- this was a firm favourite and I will be making this soon. I did decide to make my pasta from scratch, and thanks to [Angela Hartnett](https://www.reddit.com/r/CookbookLovers/comments/1jwahkm/new_cookbook_alertangela_hartnetts_cucina_three/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and the pasta machine we have ever only used once but have had for close to ten years, this was so much fun!

I have tried making the orange chicken several times this year with differing degrees of success. The hardest part about it is sourcing fennel and shallots. I surmise that these are every-day items in American/European stores but I can find these two items only sometimes at specialty (read 'fancy shmancy') stores. So I have made this with onions and fennels, and this time of year I could only find shallots (for the first time with shallots) but not fennel. I was not phased by this though because the last time I had tried this, I used carrots, which, as I have recently learnt, are under the same 'family' as the fennel anyway.

[so maybe not a total bust replacing fennel with carrots???](https://preview.redd.it/maedflarrs9g1.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=d49d56e2589f59a336008d4ced3b2dac543e0563)

The carrots soak up all of the juices from the orange zest, fennel seeds and coriander chicken fat and it is soooo good that I look forward to the carrots the most. I did tweak one thing though because the marinade is so awesome but I have never felt like that flavour translates past the skin of the chicken so I made an orange brine, inspired by several orange chicken brine recipes found online, but instead I replaced the ingredients with the ingredients from the marinade recipe (coriander seeds, fennel seeds, sage, one shallot, 1/4 cup sugar + 1 cup of salt, 1.5 liters pure orange juice and 1.5 liters water). The shallots and carrots are roasted under the chicken, in the same roasting pan.

  
So, besides making my own pasta from scratch, I made only two dishes- easy peasy. I plated the roasted carrots and shallots on cream cheese (smoky, honey mustard flavoured cream cheese) and sprinkled pine nuts over the dish. 

  
My cousin made this [date coffee cake](https://creative-culinary.com/date-coffee-cake-walnuts-espresso/) which has been on my pinterest board for years, it was okay but mostly glad I got to make something I saved years ago... finally.

**Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille** – Chai tea, gingerbread cookies, and potpourri during the holidays. Legendary.

**Byredo Bal d’Afrique** – Non-gourmand Pina Colada bordering on spoiled. Intensely gorgeous and moving in a way I never would have expected; brings tears to my eyes occasionally.

**Etat Libre D’Orange Sécrétions Magnifique** – Aquatic air fresheners, metal, salt, worms drowning in puddles, spit drying in the sun, sterile death. Addictive.

**Etat Libre d’Orange You or Someone Like You** – Rub fresh mint leaves between your fingers and smell them. Lightly flavored seltzer water with a smooth rosy drydown.

**Le Labo Thé Noir 29** – Dark, rich and moody red wine, tea, and dry scratchy bay leaves. Really classy with a funky edge.

**Parfums de Marly Oajan** – Pumpkin spice, amber accord, and fresh baked goods. Straightforward but amazing.

**Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt** – Crispy and round, airy, transparent and breezy. Similar style to Mojave Ghost.

**Byredo Mojave Ghost** – Ethereal yet crispy and satisfying fruity quality, somewhat akin to clicking a nice button or tapping a bongo drum.

**Diptyque Fleur de Peau** – Hallways, marble, carpets, and clean furniture at the Ritz Carlton Central Park.

**Diptyque Philosykos** – Philosophikos transports you to frolicking in the summer meadows with not a care in the world. Freshly picked figs and snapped twigs.

**Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait** – Similar to the EDP, but denser, sweeter and richer and intoxicating. The gross milky hospital plasticky tones are gone. Stunning and unique.

**Byredo Bibliothèque** – Plum and peach clashing with old, dusty, inky, leathery book bindings.

**Creed Silver Mountain Water** – Clean, refreshing and inky. Lightly perfumed snow.

**Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous** – Carbonated, champagne-esque baby wipes.

**Vilhelm Mango Skin** – Mango gummies.

**BDK Rouge Smoking** – Cherry Cola.

**DS & Durga Steamed Rainbow** – Evokes memories of playing out with hose water as a child. Damp rocks. A bit floral.

**Maison Francis Kurkdjian Grand Soir** – Nice amber vanilla compromised by an astringent and sharp medicinal note, possibly the lavender? The dry-down is nice and smooth. Classy.

**Tom Ford Ombre Leather** – Smooth and buttery black leather compromised by a sharp note poking through the middle.

**By Kilian Angels’ Share** – Praline and simple syrup. Some booze. Pleasant, smooth, glassy, yet simple, hollow, and underwhelming.

**Byredo Blanche** – Expensive laundry detergent.

**Diptyque Eau Rose** – Pure rosewater.

**Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540** – Airy and transparent weirdly behaving nuclear plastic sugar bomb. Freshly opened pack of diapers? Potentially. Really, really cool though.

**Byredo Alto Astral** – Clean and fresh coconut water with a hint of electrical fire.

**DS & Durga Debaser** – Overly harsh, abusive and green. Not fruity enough.

**Tom Ford Oud Wood** – Off-gassing latex gloves and plastic Dollar Store items. Pitiful.

**Xerjoff Cruz del Sur II** – Tropical fruits and freezer-burnt ice sitting in a plastic blender.

**Le Labo Baie 19** – Blueberry poops/burps masked with cheap bathroom air freshener and bug spray. Cool and interesting. The Lotion version smells incredible.

**Le Labo Another 13** – Sometimes cat fur, sometimes wet socks.

**Nasomatto Sadonaso** – Really nice yummy sugary coffee note smothered in old cat piss and unwashed undergarments. Interesting but not wearable.

**Diptyque Bois Corse** – Rotten wood, corn syrup, and coffee with a side of bug spray. Horrendous—laughably bad.

**Diptyque Liliphea** – Revolting and gut-wrenching rotten pond water and wet dogs. Think of the jelly goo on the underside of lily pads. Slight tinge of vanilla.",4,1766864309.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend just left me because of something extremely minor and I am leveled. I want to preface by saying I am in no way perfect and my boyfriend can be the absolute best. I love him dearly but I have suspected something like BPD for awhile because he puts me on a pedestal then will withdraw the pedastal slightly but its getting where he pulls the pedastal away quite drastically. He is now telling me I disregulate his nervous system and am a toxic partner and the main character just like my mother and brought up things I told him in confidence sort of using them against me. Just recently he said I felt like home to him and extolled me. It seems the bloom is off the rose though and I am disappointing him more and he gets angry over minor things, is touchy and terse, and makes a cycle of dysfunction where I don’t know what to say but I never do the right thing either way. He seems to project and say I make him walk on eggshells when I try and be pleasant and agreeable and he is nit picking me more and more. I know at times I am in the wrong, some times right, most times that we fight it’s just neutral stuff. Not worth the blow ups. But the blow ups are always a level 10.

So these incidents regardless are earth shaking and always over rather minor things that he blows up over that result in these rants that almost seem like sabotage, like he will see me as this black and white being but mostly evil. Just a few weeks prior the sun rose and set on me. No cheating or lying from either party. I have tried to help him with things in his life and situations and think I’ve been very patient and extended myself, but he has also with me. So all the upsets over petty things where I become the devil leave me rattled and doubting myself.

My thinking is relationship have ups and downs and most things you can look over because the person is mostly good, but he gets upset over semi minor issues that I don’t mean to be offensive regarding so there are always monster fights with no breaks as frequency increases. He will then start saying he is the bad guy, always wrong etc etc. makes things very black and white rather than calming down and seeing we just have a different view. He will talk me in circles. 

He is also often increasingly terse with me, which puts me on edge. He doesn’t see me as a whole, I just become whatever pissed him off in passing and that’s enough to tear the house down. I will remind him after he gets pissed off, like with what happened this morning, how I rubbed his neck, brought him coffee as a way to put me into perspective and remind him I wasn’t trying to be a bitch when I didnt read his mind, then he will even bring that up to me saying, “you think you are good because you brought me coffee”. In my mind I am as good for bringing him coffee and rubbing his neck as I am bad for not understanding what he exactly wanted me to do in a moment like what happened earlier. I cannot console him.

Even a few days ago he was talking about how happy and beautiful I looked and how I really meshed with his family and how he fell in love with me all over again then today he blows up because I didn’t know of a coffee house in the area for us to meet his friend at, friend visiting from out of town and wants to meet in an area with a decent theater so he can catch a movie later, but boyfriend got angry because I didn’t know of a coffee shop nearby the theater and I suggested he Google the area. What happens between me saying Google the area and him walking out is a haze. He kept saying I thought we could look at it together and I replied I thought he would look at the options since he knows his friends taste better and I would assist from there. No problem. He absolutely blew up though. And granted after him yelling at me I told him to leave and to meet his friend and let’s get space but he kept on and on and said if he leaves it will be for good. Very all or nothing. He woul ask me over and over if I wanted him to leave for good. I said if he is going to be abusive and yell maybe we should think about it. Maybe I should not have said that but I am reaching a breaking point where I don’t want out but I can’t take the tirades and boundaries seem to make him even angrier. So it ended up I just sat and listened because any attempt I make to defend myself didnt go well. I went to another room and got out of his way. He would come in the room and argue with me and continue to say how bad a person I am. How cold and robotic. A bitch. He cried and would continue to argue from the other room but I was reeling because he said pretty bad things and I wanted to not make it worse. Idk. I just am in shock and numb. It all seemed like such an overkill and he has been touchy and irritable for weeks though.

Over all I was demonized and he said some egregious things-I thought I was perfect, I call the shots etc, am a liar, things that in no way a person would want to continue in a relationship with having such a low opinion of their partner. I would ask him why on earth is he with me if he thinks these things then he would say he loved me and stayed because he loved me. It was all so baffling. I felt diminished, sad, speechless, cast aside, weird, confused and unlovable yet loved. Really floored. And I was damned if I talked, damned if I didn’t.

Please any insight on what to do or what may be happening in a situation like this? I feel horrible.",1,1766864068.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False
1px6fye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1px6fye/eating_more_food/,Eating more food,"does eating more food help you with controlling your seizures? 

  
when I had my first one it was in 2021. the doctors think it was stress and anxiety but I also wasnt really eating much those days. not necessarily on purpose, I just didn’t make time to eat or make food. my grandma would constantly comment on my weight at those times too and I did loose weight but at that time I didnt think about it much. I would eat lots of fries and Dr Pepper at my work during that time too. I went to college that fall and my eating habits didn’t change that much as Im slightly picky about food and ate meals at school. growing up my mom cooked amazing healthy food and going from that to eating school food like meatball subs (which I didnt eat) was a struggle. Over the next three years it was kind of the same until my senior year of college. I stopped drinking caffeine my junior year (pop, coffee, even teas) and I feel like that helped a lot and I still dont really do caffeine. Senior year I started getting up earlier to eat breakfast. Bacon or sausage, egg, bagel or sandwich. I think It helped my body feel more full and less gross. Now that I’m out of college it’s easier to eat more food and better food but idk if I’m emprovjng any… I Have a smoothie with fruit and 20g protein chobani yogurt almost every mornin, salad with chicken or an egg for lunch, and a full meal with protein and everything for supper. I  don’t work out and probably should….? i feel like I’ve kind of improved with my seizures. Haven’t had a full on one since june and that was in the hospital when they were trying to get me to have one. Before that I think my last one was last winter. 

I  think cutting out caffeine and fixing my diet has helped (I havent gained much weight since 2021 though) but what else should I do? I dont want to do a keto diet even though people have told me I should try it. Are there certain workouts or things that might be good for someone like me?",2,1766864068.0,Epilepsy,2,1.0,False

I recently moved to Bangalore and currently staying near Manyata Tech Park. I’m in my mid-20s and still figuring out the city.

Looking to connect with people around the area to hang out—could be for
	•	coffee / street food hopping ☕
	•	weekend walks or chill plans
	•	movies, casual outings, or exploring nearby places

Nothing fancy, just looking to make a few genuine friends and not spend all weekends indoors 😄

If you’re nearby or in a similar phase, feel free to comment or DM.

Cheers!

New to Bambino Plus, just purchased it and have been using the Equator Coffee Beans ground using Bodum at a setting of 'Fine' (measured about 18 grams of coffee beans). Not the best grinder and i'm in the process of replacing it

But when the coffee gets ground, the portafilter is fully covered and flush with the ground coffee. I'm talking about a double-shot, single-wall, spouted portafilter, the one that comes stock with the machine.

After tamping, the coffee level is flush with the upper level of the portafilter, and I'm wondering if that's normal?

I've usually seen videos where you see at least about 1 to 3 mm of portafilter wall being visible. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks!

Sidebar: till I get my new grinder, have any of you used the grinder machine at Whole Foods to grind the beans? If so, what setting do y'all use? I used the smallest setting in the 'Espresso' section. But that doesn't give me the right amount of espresso including the taste that's a bit off. i'm thinking if i should lean a bit more towards the 'Turkish' setting. iykyk.",1,1766863904.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1st layout: the sink is almost at the corner, which sucks, and not enough space between it and the fridge. But there’s enough space for cooking. Plus there are these tall cabinets (fridge on one side and over with microwave on the other) on both sides and high cabinets in between. 

2nd layout: tall cabinets are next to the same wall. Good distance between fridge-sink-stove. But there’s no ventilation over the stove. And probably no high cabinets. 

3rd layout: similar to the second, but no U-shape so less space for cooking. High cabinets.

Aaj achanak duniya bhar ke users ko ChatGPT login karne aur use karne mein badi dikkat aa rahi hai. Is blog mein hum dekhenge ki aakhir ye global outage kyun hui hai aur ye kab tak thik hoga.

# Duniya Bhar Se Aa Rahi Hain Reports (Live Data)

Sirf India hi nahi, balki poori duniya mein log is outage se pareshan hain. Niche di gayi table se aap dekh sakte hain ki kahan-kahan kis tarah ki samasya aa rahi hai:

# ChatGPT Kyun Nahi Chal Raha? (Asli Wajah)

Doston, ChatGPT jaise bade AI platform ke band hone ke peeche aksar 3 bade technical kaaran hote hain:

1. **Server Overload:** Jab ek hi second mein karodon log sawal puchte hain, toh OpenAI ke servers ""Hang"" ho jate hain. Ise hum 'At Capacity' error bhi kehte hain.
2. **Backend Update:** OpenAI hamesha apne model ko behtar banane ke liye updates karta rehta hai. Maintenance ke dauran service thodi der ke liye offline chali jati hai.
3. **API Glitch:** Kabhi-kabhi unki API (jo software ko connect karti hai) mein koi bug aa jata hai, jis wajah se message send nahi ho paate.

# Is Problem Ko Fix Kaise Karein? (Quick Checklist)

Jab tak OpenAI ki team ise thik nahi karti, aap ye 4 nuskhe azma sakte hain:

* **Incognito Mode:** Ek baar Chrome ke Incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N) mein login karke dekhein. Kai baar purane cache ki wajah se bhi site nahi khulti.
* **Browser Update:** Check karein ki aapka browser latest version par hai ya nahi. Outdated browsers nay security features ko block kar sakte hain.
* **VPN Band Karein:** Agar aap VPN use kar rahe hain, toh use off kar dein. OpenAI kayi baar VPN IPs ko security ke liye block kar deta hai.
* **Alternatives Ka Sahara Lein:** Agar kaam bahut zaroori hai aur wait nahi kar sakte, toh **Google Gemini** ya **Microsoft Copilot** try karein. Dono hi filhal acche options hain.

# Conclusion

ChatGPT ka down hona humein ehsas dilata hai ki hum AI par kitne nirbhar ho chuke hain. Lekin fikr ki koi baat nahi hai; aisi global outages aksar **30 se 60 minutes** mein thik ho jati hain. Tab tak aap thoda break le lijiye ya coffee pee lijiye!

1px60yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1px60yi/losing_my_mind_trying_to_figure_out_my_coworker/,Losing my mind trying to figure out my coworker! WLW,"


So.. I have a coworker-friend called Georgia who is 12 years older than me (im 27) We have worked together for about three years in different departments, and everyone at work knows we are really close. 

We take our breaks together, constantly find each other during shifts, and have loads of inside jokes. Colleagues joke that we are inseparable or tell us to “stop flirting,” which we always laugh off.
Georgia is Eastern European and very reserved and private shes also extremely shy and quite anxious.

She does not open up easily to people. We joke all the time that we “cannot be nice to each other” at work because that would look suspicious, so instead we tease, blame, and bully each other playfully. We say being mean “looks better,” and we constantly joke, “we are just colleagues, remember.”
A lot of our interaction is silly back-and-forth banter. We literally order each other around as a joke. She will say things like “Get me a coffee, thanks,” and I will respond with “Why should I, huh?” Or she will tell me to make her a coffee and I will say, “Say please and I might consider it,” and she will bat her eyelashes and go, “Pleeeease, Luuuuuuce?” It is all very unserious and mutual, but very visible to other people.

She often asks when I am working next and checks my schedule, and when we are in together we naturally gravitate toward each other without really trying.

She has two young kids. I am not a very kid-oriented person and she knows that, but I genuinely like her kids and they seem to really like me too. Over the last couple of years I have spent a lot of time with her and the kids doing things like bowling, going to cafés, Halloween trick-or-treating, and Christmas markets two years in a row. A lot of these were first-time experiences for them.

 The kids know me by name, ask about me, get excited when my name is mentioned, and sometimes assume I am coming over. She has told me they miss me, and this year they even made me a Christmas card with a heart.

English is not her first language, and joking about it is a big part of our dynamic. I tease her when she gets words wrong, she laughs and pretends to be offended, and she calls me her “English teacher.” She also jokes that I am a bad influence because I teach her swear words. 

This year she also wrote me a Christmas card that said “Thanks for the English lessons this year” and gave me my favourite chocolate bar, something I had only mentioned off-hand a few weeks earlier.


She tells me a lot about her personal life and her relationship, which she is unhappy in. When something stressful happens, I am usually the first person she reaches out to. Once she messaged me at 5am and later said she never messages anyone at that time except her “bestie.”

At work there is also a lot of playful physical stuff like joking hits, arm slaps, hair pulling, blaming me for everything, and holding eye contact longer than necessary. Other colleagues notice it and joke about us, and we joke that people are going to “talk about us.”
Recently, we finally hung out just the two of us without the kids, which she was a bit shy about at first but agreed to after a lot of joking back and forth.

At the Christmas market this year, she took her son to meet Santa for the first time ever. I waited outside while they went in. Afterward, she said that she wanted me to come in with them. I didn't know how to react so I just laughed and said maybe the dad should do it and she rolled her eyes. 

What confuses me is the overall intensity of it all, especially involving the kids. I did not expect to become such a familiar person in her children’s lives, and sometimes I wonder why their dad does not do these things with them, which she usually brushes off. Idk what to do.

1px60bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1px60bj/im_the_slowest_man_alive_izuku_said_to_aizawa/,“I’m the slowest man alive!” Izuku said to Aizawa.,"“…What?” Aizawa asked in confusion.

“I can move slower than a speeding bullet.”

“That’s every person ever.”

“Slower than a bolt of lightning!”

“It’d be concerning if you couldn’t.”

“Able to save people in a couple of hours!”

“Maybe just turn off your power.” Aizawa said dryly before Izuku headed off.

“I’m off to save the city!” 

“You’re gonna die.”

“Then it’ll be a slow and heroic death!”

“Probably just the first one.”

——-

Aizawa sipped his coffee as he entered his classroom, only to spit it out at seeing Izuku. “Slowest man alive!”

“How do you keep getting in here?!”

“Justice always finds a way! And Nedzu let me in.” He said as he stretched. “He said since o saved someone, I’m in the school.”

“Oh wh- wait you saved someone?” Aizawa asked as his annoyance turned to shock.

“Yeah, a hero threw me at a person who was falling, then I slowed myself down mid air as I can into contact with them, giving everyone enough time to get everything in position. Slow motion power! And it’s all because you believed in me!”

“…Okay Izuku, I owe you a massive apology.” Aizawa said as pinched the bridge of his nose. “I geniunely believed you would die, and that your quirk had absolutely no use. It’s not often I’m wrong, but in this case I was wrong.”

“So you’ll help me defeat my nemesis?”

“…What?”

“My nemesis, who aims to be the slowest man alive.”

“Is that a title anyone wants?”

“I’m racing him tomorrow, and I need you there to support me.”

“…Fine.”

——-

“How are so many people here!?” Aizawa yelled as he looked at all the people in the stadium.

“Because this is actually kind of epic, seeing who the slowest person in the world is.” Mina said as Aizawa gaped his mouth open.

“I cannot believe that people actually want that title.”

“Ladies and Gentlemen!” Denki yelled as the announcer. “We have gathered here today to watch Izuku race to the start with Reverse Izuku!”

“What?” Exhaustaion plauged Aizawas voice.

“Rules are as follows!” Tenya yelled as he acted as the referee. “Whoever finished first loses, running backwards is illegal, you have to at least be moving forward. If you fall asleep you will be disqualified, however knocking oneself unconscious is allowed, as long as it’s down while moving forward.”

“Who wrote these rules?” Aizawa asked in exasperation.

“Ready!” Tenya held up a flare gun. “Go!”

Aizawa groaned as he sat down before he widened his eyes. “IZUKU ARE YOU BREAKING YOUR LEGS!?”

1px5z7v,https://i.redd.it/dl00xxviqs9g1.jpeg,Iced Cinnamon Roll Cake: Delicious And Easy Recipe,"If you’re anything like me, you love the taste of a freshly baked cinnamon roll but don’t always have the time or patience to deal with yeast and rising dough. That’s where this iced cinnamon roll cake comes in! It’s basically the perfect mix of a moist cinnamon cake and a gooey cinnamon roll without all the extra effort. I made this last weekend for a cozy breakfast treat with my family, and it was a hit! If you want more detailed steps, I wrote down the full recipe here: [Iced Cinnamon Roll Cake](https://www.amgroyal.com/iced-cinnamon-roll-cake)  
  
Here’s what you need to make it:  
  
For the cake:  
2 cups all-purpose flour  
1 cup granulated sugar  
1 tbsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1 cup milk  
2 large eggs  
1/2 cup melted butter (unsalted)  
  
For the cinnamon swirl:  
3/4 cup brown sugar (light or dark)  
1 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon  
1/4 cup melted butter  
  
For the glaze:  
2 cups powdered sugar  
4 tbsp milk (adjust for consistency)  
1 tbsp vanilla extract  
  
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.  
2. In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the milk, eggs, and melted butter until just combined don’t overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared dish.  
3. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and melted butter for the swirl. Drop spoonfuls of the mixture over the cake batter, then use a knife to swirl it throughout the batter. You don’t need to be perfect those swirls make it so pretty after it’s baked.  
4. Bake for about 30–35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let it cool for 10–15 minutes.  
5. While the cake is cooling, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla to make the glaze. Drizzle it generously over the warm cake so it sinks into every nook and cranny.  
  
Notes:  
\- If you want to make this more of a cinnamon coffee cake, try adding a layer of streusel topping before swirling in the cinnamon mix.  
\- Store leftovers (if there are any!) in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Just pop a slice in the microwave for 10 seconds to make it taste freshly baked.  
\- You can substitute almond milk for regular milk if you’re dairy-free, but the butter glaze really ties the whole “iced cinnamon roll cake” vibe together, so don’t skip it unless you need to!  
  
This sweet breakfast cake is so simple but feels like such a treat. I think it’s perfect for a lazy weekend brunch or even as a cinnamon roll dessert after dinner. Do you have a go-to breakfast cake idea like this, or have you made something similar? Let me know I’m always looking for inspiration!",2,1766862906.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

My family said they needed to exchange something in one of the stores on the lower floors so I got told to go to the toilet and meet them at the store.

I go to the toilet and after a bit of directions I get to the store and they aren’t there.

I get a call from my sister saying that they are outside the building. And she drops her live location for outside this coffee shop. I go to the coffee shop and they aren’t there only to get a call from them saying they are back on the other side of the road.

At this point I feel completely humiliated for not particular reason whatsoever. By the time I find them I’m pretty annoyed and make sure they know about it, and apparently my reaction was “embarrassing, disgusting etc”. I get into a pretty heavy argument with my sister over it too and now everyone is either uncomfortable or hates me because I went to a location and they weren’t there.

I see posts asking how to take the leap into filmmaking so I wanted to share my experience making my first short:

I was looking for film community in LA and found Secret Movie Club, a small theater that held a monthly “open mic short night” where they screened shorts made from that month’s theme.

December’s theme? “Holiday and New Year.” Go figure.

Because, at 28, I had zero film experience, I wrote a story completely contained in dialogue. It was about two exes meeting at a diner on Christmas.

I asked Julie, the barista at my local coffee shop, and Reid, who I met at SMC, if they would act in it for free and they said yes.

I called twenty or thirty diners in LA and they all said no, or yes..for a lot of money.

Finally, a man in San Diego said he was happy to let me film in his diner for four hours after close for $150.

A friend gave me the number of a wedding photographer named David. I called and asked him if he’d help and he said yes and that he had a BMPCC4k, which he explained was a camera.

I found someone on Craigslist who could do sound and rented the equipment for $50.

After a couple rehearsals, we all drove to San Diego together and made the short and watched it play at SMC later that month.

Anyway, did that all bore you to death?

I thought with 2025 winding down it would be nice to reflect on my perfume journey so far and what this hobby means to me after sampling all these perfumes.

I went all-in on this hobby the last few years. I'm not sure what started it, my mom was a B&BW body spray once-in-a-while kind of person, my grandmothers never wore scents that I could remember. My sister did buy a few full designer bottles over the years that I would occasionally try (Prada Candy, JPG Scandal, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle). I did start a corporate job a few years ago where more people around me were wearing nice scents and it got me curious as to what they were wearing. I remember someone walking by me one day smelling like a citrus floral cup of tea, then sitting down that night and trying to figure out what it was based on the notes. I ordered a travel of NEST Indigo (which I still adore to this day- but I'm not 100% sure this is what I originally smelled) and this started off my journey. 

I made myself some rules early on to enjoy perfumes responsibly-

* No blind buying full bottles (30ml+), unless it's a cheapie. I did break this rule a few times at the beginning and blind bought 30ml and 50ml bottles of some medium- to high-end perfumes. I gave away one but I do generally adore them and expect to have them long-term.
* In order to get a full bottle of anything I absolutely adore, I need to go through a sample and/or a travel first (I am well on my way for a couple scents for this- specifically NEST Indigo, Prada Paradoxe, Burberry Goddess and Kayali Vanilla 28).
* The vast majority (410+) of my collection is samples, minis, or decants/travels under 10ml. I did the math once, and since the majority of my collection is small amounts, it would take me 5-6 years at my current consumption rate to go through my whole collection (I generally spray 2-4 sprays, sometimes more if I'm not planning on going out or less if I am, and wear a few scents a day).
* No going into my savings to fuel this hobby- easy to do for myself since I fortunately have a decent discretionary budget and I live frugally.
* I avoid perfume instagram/tiktok to try to avoid all the influencing/marketing/ads/hype, but I do see some through the perfume subreddits and forums, I'm not totally immune. I try to fight against FOMO by reading as many reviews as possible (some unhinged reviews can really do the trick here haha). I live in Canada which makes it harder to order some scents sometimes, but I have a handful of decant sites that I've been using (as well as Sephora and Shopper's Drug Mart).

I discovered that while I appreciated the aesthetics of bottles, I liked being able to try and sample new perfumes more. I also like being able to walk around and identify what people are wearing in public. After trying out so many, I started to pursue less scent profiles (since I was starting to smell similar scent profiles over and over again) and more well-blended, well-designed scents by particular perfumers who created other perfumes I adored. I keep a spreadsheet to track which perfumes I was wearing, their notes, the scent family, what they smelled similar to, and some general journaling on what they smelled like to me. I also use a mix of Fragrantica and Parfumo to browse perfumes.

My tastes have changed over time, but I'm generally not very picky. I adored 80, really liked 200, liked 150, thought 70 were ok and disliked 5. I love gourmands primarily (specifically baked goods, anything coconut/caramel, coffee, pistachio, honey), spicy (specifically saffron, cardamom, cinnamon) scents, airy or woody or ambery vanillas, juniper, fig, plum, black currant, I appreciate a well-balanced rose or a sweet ylang-ylang, love freshies/aquatics in the humidity of the summer, really like tea scents. I generally dislike dominating leather/suede, pavement, tobacco, most powder (though there are lots of exceptions here that I really adore, specifically if they have iris/violet), tomato leaves, and oud/palo santo if it's dominant. There are some scents I'm surprised I like based on the notes, so I don't immediately discount something if it has a note I usually dislike.

For the next year, I want to dial it down on the sampling, pare down my collection since I'm running out of storage space, and read more about the perfume industry as a whole and the science behind perfumery. I also want to look more into some niche houses, or at least ones that are available in Canada, and visit perfume brick-and-mortar stores since I have some trips lined up to Paris, Milan, and Rome. I've got a list of probably ~15 that I would absolutely love full bottles of at some point and probably ~30 I would upgrade from sample to travel size but I'm not in any rush.

Anyone else on a similar perfume journey? Anyone have any perfume goals for 2026?",53,1766862156.0,FemFragLab,17,1.0,False

I've worked in the same place as him for years but we worked in different areas before so I didn't see him much initially. However, he transferred to my department earlier this year, so I started being with him for a few days every week. I also spent loads of time talking to him one on one as there would be lots of days where we were the only people in our area.

But now he's going back to his old department in a sudden change which was made and I'm going to go back to only seeing him for like a minute every couple of weeks if I'm lucky to even cross paths with him in the hallway. I could talk to him about loads of stuff when we were in the same room, both non-work and work related and he was the person at work I felt most comfortable around and could relate to most. But now I won't be able to have regular conversations with him and will probably only be able to have quick small talk with him if I happen to cross him in the hallway.

I'm scared that any connection we had will fade away and that we will grow distant with each other. However, I want to remain work friends with him, even if he doesn't like me back in the same way I like him. Getting to see him made what would have otherwise been boring days much better and there are not many people I've met that I've felt I can just be myself around as much.

What can I do to maintain a connection with him? I can't be really direct and ask him to go for coffee as I think this will scare him off, but I don't want us to become strangers and it to be like we never worked closely together either.",0,1766862038.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,0.5,False
1px5lzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1px5lzi/which_baratza_model_250/,Which baratza model? [£250],"Grinder upgrade - baratza encore vs ESP vs ESP pro vs something else?

After getting on for 10 years being into coffee I've decided to upgrade my grinder/espresso machine setup.
Having been using a machine that absolutely doesn't make proper espresso for a few years, I'm not super super fussy about the coffee I drink but I know and appreciate what really good coffee tastes like and want to try to replicate that a bit more at home. Ideally I also want the grinder I get to be an upgrade for filter brewing too.

I've just bought a gaggia classic for cheap (£85) on eBay and currently I have a bodum bistro grinder. This is the setup I also used in the early years of getting into coffee when I lived with my parents and as hard as I tried, since age 17 I've never got it to pull a shot in less than 22-23 seconds. 

Having done a fair bit of research I feel at the price point the baratza esp seems to be the best option (also have been very tempted by cheaper DF64 models, and the fellow opus is a very pretty grinder but haven't heard great things about them).

Budget is about 250 tops, but obviously I'd rather pay a bit less. Having seen the baratza ESP pro at £250 vs the standard ESP at 160, and then the encore at 140 - is it worth the extra £90 for the features on the pro, or should I save my money?

Lawyer at her side. Divorce papers in hand.
""Miss Winters, thank you for these five years. You've been amazing."" 
She said, smiling like I'm the nanny she's firing.
""But Jake's REAL wife and Anson's REAL mom are back now. Your time to go.""
My brain shuts down. I can't speak. Can't move.
It turned out that five years of my life? 
Just a ""human stress test"" Jake had to pass before daddy handed him the keys to the kingdom.
It turned out that my husband? NOT my husband. My son? NOT my son!
All just a test. A game.
And me? I was nobody. A random pick. A prop during this show.
They thought I'd take this? Swallow it down and leave quietly?
WRONG!
Jake Sutherland loved playing poor? Fine.
Then I'll make sure he's poor. For REAL this time.

Yesterday, Jake and I were in our shoebox apartment, raising cheap wine to celebrate. We'd finally paid off his million-dollar debt.

Today, his FIANCÉE Rosalie Laurent is at my door with a lawyer, sliding divorce papers across the table.

""Sloane."" Her voice is warm, practiced. ""Thank you for these five years. You've been amazing.""

She smiles like she's dismissing a nanny. ""But Jake's REAL wife is back now. Anson's REAL mom. So let's keep this clean, okay? Time for you to go.""

My mind goes blank. I try to speak. Nothing comes out.

Rosalie sees it. She picks up the remote and turns on the TV.

Jake fills the screen. Sharp suit. Perfect smile. The headline reads:

""Jake Sutherland: Sole Heir Returns.""

The anchor's voice is full of praise. ""After completing his grassroots training, Jake Sutherland has proven himself to the board. Sources say he went from nothing to building a multi-million-dollar company—all in just five years...""

Every word is a knife.

He took everything—every shift I worked, every dollar I saved, every piece of myself I gave up—and turned it into his success story?

Rosalie keeps talking. Smiling. ""It was a test, Sloane. A pressure test. To see if Jake could handle real life before taking over the family business.""

She pauses.

""And you?"" Her eyes sweep across our cramped living room.

When she looks back at me again, there's pity.

""You were just part of the test. Randomly selected. Nothing personal.""

She tilts her head. ""You played the wife really well, though.""

""But the show's over now.""

My phone buzzes after they leave. The screen lights up: JAKE.

I pick up without thinking.

His voice cuts through, cold and flat.

""Sloane. The whole broke-couple thing? It's done. You made it to the end. But you didn't pass the test.""

""Test?""

""Yeah. Test."" He laughs—short, sharp. ""I had to prove to the board I could build something from nothing. That I could find someone loyal enough to stick around through the worst of it. Rosalie bankrolled the whole thing. She's my real fiancée. You? You were just the stand-in. A random pick to play the wife.""

My heart tightens. ""So the debt... it was all fake?""

""It was startup capital with a different name. Had to make it sound bad enough to see how you'd react under pressure.""

My nails dig into my palm. ""You're such an asshole, Jake.""

""Maybe."" He doesn't even flinch. ""But this asshole just inherited a billion-dollar company. There's a check on the coffee table. Take it. Sign the papers. Walk away. Don't embarrass yourself now.""

He pauses. Then he goes for the kill.

""Oh—and Anson? She's not yours. Never was. Rosalie and I did IVF years ago. The embryos we made together? They got swapped out before implantation.""

""You were just watching him for us. Now his actual mom's back. So pack your stuff and get out. The house belongs to the Sutherlands.""

His words hit me like ice water. My whole body goes cold.

Like someone just shoved me into a freezer.

""Rosalie and the lawyers are already there. They'll walk you through it. And Sloane?"" His voice drops. ""Don't make a scene. Keep it together.""

The line goes dead.

I'm still gripping the phone. It feels like it's bu//rning a hole through my hand.

Watching her for us.

That's all I ever was. A stand-in. A prop in their story.

And now that the curtain's down, they're taking it all back—and throwing me out with the garbage.

After Jake hangs up, Rosalie doesn't storm around or throw her weight. Instead, she gives me this look—like I'm a puppy that got left in the rain.

""God, these five years must've been HELL. But I'll give you credit—you really committed. You actually made me believe it.""

Then she breezes past me, straight into Anson's room. Like she's done it a hundred times before.

""Anson, baby. Mommy's here.""

My son—the kid I've been raising for FIVE YEARS—drops his robot and bolts into her arms.

""Rosalie Mommy!""

Rosalie's already digging through her Chanel bag, pulling out some fancy imported candy.

Then she unwraps one and feeds it to Anson like it's the most natural thing in the world.

""Told you I'd come get you once Daddy's work thing was over, didn't I? So... Disneyland this weekend?""

""YES! You're the BEST!""

They're giggling. Hugging. Whispering like I'm not standing ten feet away.

Like I'm invisible.

Like THEY'RE the ones who've been a family this whole time.

Rosalie glances around the apartment, still holding Anson on her hip. Her eyes land on the couch I bought secondhand after scouring Craigslist for weeks.

Her nose wrinkles.

""Jesus, Jake really made you live like this?"" She waves at the furniture like it's contaminated. ""This stuff... it doesn't belong here.""

She turns to the lawyer. ""Mr. Lee, call someone. I want all of this cleared out by tomorrow. Jake's place can't look like a garage sale.""

""Of course, Miss Laurent.""

Every word out of her mouth is a slap.

I pinched pennies for five years. Skipped meals. Worked doubles. I thought we were building something TOGETHER.

To her, it's all just tra//sh cluttering up her fiancé's life.

Mr. Lee walks over, holding out a pen. His face is stone.

""Miss Winters. Sign here. Five hundred thousand is extremely generous for a five-year arrangement. Mr. Sutherland and Miss Laurent are being more than fair.""

""Fair?""

I repeat it. The word tastes like acid.

""Correct."" He pushes his glasses up. ""And Miss Laurent wanted me to pass along a reminder—don't make this messy. I think you understand what that would mean.""

The threat hangs in the air.

Rosalie drifts closer, Anson still clinging to her. She's smiling that perfect, practiced smile.

""Sloane, we're not trying to intimidate you. You're a smart woman. You know how this works.""

She looks down at Anson, her voice dripping with sugar.

""Say bye to... Miss Sloane, sweetheart. She's leaving now.""

Anson peeks out at me. His face is blank.

""Dad told me. You didn't pass his test.""

Those eyes—the ones that used to look at me like I hung the moon—are empty now.

""Anson... what?""

""Dad said real women don't obsess over money. But you were always freaking out about the electric bill. Driving all over town for coupons. Yelling at me for breaking one dumb toy.""

""I wasn't yelling, I was just—""

""Dad said that's what small people do. You think small. And your love is small too. It's... suffocating.""

I reach for his hand.

He yanks it back like I'm diseased.

""Don't touch my robot. You can't even afford it.""

He looks up at Rosalie. ""Can we go? I don't wanna be here anymore. Dad said her BROKE ENERGY might rub off on me.""

Broke energy.

The words hit like a punch to the gut.

I stare at them both.

And then I suddenly laugh.

My laugh stops them cold.

They were waiting for tears. For me to fall apart. To beg.

""What's funny?"" Rosalie's voice sharpens.

""Nothing."" I shake my head. ""You guys just make a really good team.""

I walk to the bedroom and yank three plastic bins out from under the bed.

""Oh, so you're actually gonna pack up and go? Finally being smart about this.""

Rosalie leans in the doorway, arms folded. She's enjoying this.

I don't respond.

I start pulling things out. Everything I've saved from the last five years.

Pay stubs. Bank statements from every job I juggled. Credit card bills—mine, and Jake's ""broke"" card that I paid off every month. Every transaction printed and highlighted.

Rosalie watches. At first she's smirking. Then confused. Then—just for a second—nervous.

""Sloane, what are you doing? You think a pile of receipts is gonna scare us? We've got lawyers who eat people like you for breakfast.""

I keep going.

Then I pull out a manila folder. Flip through it. Find what I need.

The receipt for Anson's limited-edition robot.

My name on the invoice. My bank account on the payment line.

I set it on top of the stack.

I close the bins. Like I'm closing the chapter on this five years of nonsense.

Three of them. Heavy.

Inside them, there are no clothes. No shoes. No makeup. Just five years of proof that I gave everything—and got nothing.

I look up.

""I'm taking these.""

Mr. Lee barely glances over. ""Miss Winters, those are household records. Shared assets. You can't just take them. And frankly, they won't matter in court.""

Rosalie's still watching me like I'm unhinged. That smug smile hasn't moved.

""God, you really are all about the money, huh? That's all you'll ever be.""

""Yeah."" I meet her eyes. ""I am.""

Because money doesn't lie to you. It doesn't tell you you're not enough at two in the morning.

I grab the bins and head for the door. Slip my shoes on.

I don't look at Anson.

I take my ID. My passport. My debit card. And these three bins that feel heavier than anything I've ever carried.

My hand's on the doorknob when Rosalie's voice drifts over.

Casual. Almost sweet.

""See, baby? That's exactly what I meant. Women like her don't deserve to be moms. All they care about is money.""

I pull the door shut behind me.

Their laughter follows me out.

I'm dragging three bins down the street like dead weight. My feet barely lift off the pavement. I'm a ghost drifting through the city—nobody sees me, nobody cares.

The sun's setting. Lights start popping on in apartment windows.

Warm yellow glows bleeding out onto the sidewalk. But the warmer they look, the colder I feel inside. Like every single one of them is laughing at me:

Look at you. You don't even have a place to sleep.

I stumble into a budget motel. Figure I'll crash for the night. I've still got a few grand in my account. Should be enough for a week or two while I figure things out.

I slide my card across the counter.

""Sorry, ma'am. This one's declined.""

I blink. Try another.

""That one's not going through either.""

I pull out a third. A fourth. My credit cards. One after another.

Same result every time.

ACCOUNT FROZEN.

I let out a bitter laugh. Jake really doesn't do anything halfway. Kicked me out, and now he's making sure I can't even eat.

I turn to leave—and a sleek black Mercedes rolls up outside.

""Miss Winters. Fancy seeing you again.""

It's Mr. Lee. Still wearing that dead-eyed expression like he's reading off a script.

""What do you want?""

""Just tying up loose ends."" He holds out a folder. ""This afternoon, you removed confidential financial documents from the Sutherland Heir Training Project. Receipts, ledgers, internal records. The company's classified this as theft of proprietary information. So Mr. Sutherland has decided to revoke your severance package, that five hundred thousand dollars.""

My brain flatlines.

The stuff I stayed up all night organizing—the proof I spent YEARS collecting—he's calling it theft?

""Oh, and one more thing."" Mr. Lee's watching me like he's waiting for me to break. He pulls out another file.

I know that cover.

Five years ago, I signed it.

Jake said it was a prenup. To protect me if things went south.

My heart tightens. I can't breathe.

He flips to a page buried in the middle. Points to a block of text so small I can barely read it. Then he reads it out loud.

""Supplementary Clause 3.1: Party B—that's you, Sloane Winters—agrees to assume the role of 'wife' and 'mother' as part of this project. The child in her care, Anson Sutherland, is the biological offspring of Party A, Jake Sutherland, and Project Investor, Rosalie Laurent, conceived via legal surrogacy arrangement. Party B is a temporary caretaker. No legal parental relationship exists.""

The ground drops out from under me.

I thought Anson was mine. I took the shots. The hormones. The nausea. The pain. I thought we made him together.

But even that was fake.

My legs are shaking so hard I can barely stand.

Mr. Lee doesn't stop. He flips to the last page.

""Supplementary Clause 7.4: All labor performed by Party B over the five-year period—including housework, childcare, and emotional support—is classified as contracted project labor. Compensation is a five-million-dollar trust fund to be distributed upon successful project completion.""

He pauses. Lets that sink in. Then his voice drops like a hammer.

""However, due to Party B's final evaluation rating of 'unsatisfactory,' per Clause 7.5, the trust fund beneficiary was officially transferred to Miss Rosalie Laurent at 3 p.m. this afternoon.""

He snaps the folder shut. Holds it out like he's handing me a death certificate.

""So, Miss Winters.

""Your five years? Just a failed job performance. Your son? Not yours. Your marriage? A contract. The money? Gone.

""You're nothing.""

I stare at the document. At my own signature at the bottom.

The marriage I bled for. The home I built with my bare hands. It was all just a corporate experiment I was never supposed to figure out.

And they used my OWN name—my OWN signature—to bury me alive.

My knees buckle.

I hit the ground hard.

Everything around me goes silent. All I can hear is my heartbeat—cracking, splintering, like glass shattering under a sledgehammer.

The despair drags me under.

...

I don't remember leaving the motel.

I just remember Mr. Lee and his buddy looking down at me. Like I'm garbage they stepped over on the sidewalk. Then they climb into the car. Doors slam. Engine purrs. They drive off without a second glance.

I'm empty. Hollowed out.

I drag the bins through the dark streets, no idea where I'm going.

My accounts are frozen. I've got maybe thirty bucks in my wallet. Can't afford a room. Can't go back to the apartment. This city's massive, but there's not a single light on for me.

I'm about to pass out. Or lose my mind. Maybe both.

And then—cutting through the fog in my brain—one thought breaks through.

Jake, you loved pretending to be broke? Let's see how you like actually being broke.

My father.

He's a genius programmer who never caught a break. Died with a hard drive full of unfinished dreams.

Right before the end, he handed me a beat-up laptop.

""Sloane, I don't have much to give you. But I made this little program. Use it to track your spending. Track your life. Just... remember me, okay?""

I kept that laptop like it was sacred. And I did what he asked.

Every single day. Every single expense. I logged it all.

I just thought maybe someday, when I finally made it, I'd sit by his grave and say: Look, Dad. We did it.

Guess the joke's on me.

But that habit—that one stupid habit—might be the only weapon I have left.

I pull the laptop out of the hidden pocket in my suitcase and boot it up.

The screen flickers to life. I open the program. Trailmark.

Dad explained it to me once. Said it used ""blockchain technology.""

Every entry I made got encrypted, timestamped, and stored across a distributed network.

Translation? It's REAL. Permanent. Untouchable!

Jake can freeze my bank accounts. He can wave some nonsense contract in my face and call me nothing.

But he can't erase THIS. Five years of proof—every dollar I earned, every bill I paid, every sacrifice I made while he played dress-up as a broke husband.

I export everything. Lock it with a password. Save it to a flash drive.

Then I scroll through my contacts. Find a name I haven't touched in years.

Huxley Shore.

Dad's best friend. A lawyer who makes corporate sharks nervous. The kind of guy who doesn't flinch when the other side brings out the big gu//ns.

After Dad died, we drifted apart.

I stare at the screen. Take a deep breath. Then I hit call.

It rings. And rings.

Finally, a groggy voice answers.

""Yeah? Who is this?""

""Huxley. It's Sloane. Sloane Winters.""

Pause. I can practically hear him trying to wake up and place the name at the same time.

""...Winters? As in—wait, your dad was—Sloane? Jesus, it's two in the morning. What happened?""

""I'm in deep trouble."" My voice shakes. ""I need a lawyer. Someone who doesn't back down. Someone who knows how to fight dirty.""

On the other end, he laughs. Low and sharp.

""You called the right guy. I'm still at the office. I'll text you the address. Bring whatever you've got.""

...

Half an hour later, I'm sitting across from Huxley in his cluttered office. The lights are harsh. There's cold coffee in a mug on his desk.

I plug the flash drive into his computer.

The screen floods with data. Five years of transactions. Receipts. Shift logs. Every penny I scraped together. Line after line after line.

Huxley's laid-back expression disappears.

His eyes lock onto the screen. He leans forward. There's something almost predatory in the way he's looking at it now.

Then he turns to me. His voice drops. Dead serious.

""Sloane. What do you want from them?""

I hold his gaze. Every bit of rage, betrayal, and heartbreak I've been swallowing for the last twelve hours—I pack it all into one sentence.

""I want them ruined. Reputation destroyed. Left with absolutely NOTHING.""",2,1766861578.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Fiance needs a new desk, and I've always wanted to build a custom desk, easy math on that one (I know an ikea desk would probably be cheaper but that's less fun).

Current plan is a big one, roughly 72""x30""x1.5"", she's got a lot of small hobbies that need the desk space and a gaming setup. She's used a standalone frame for her HOTAS and being able to mount it to the desk would be awesome, hence the need for such a large slab for the desk.

2 problems with a desk that size, I know if we make the top out of a solid slab (if we even find a slab that wide in our area) there's a real concern of cupping. Secondly I know it'll be an absolute bear to move and fenagle around.

**TLDR making a 7'x3' desk; here are the prime questions:**

**1. Is there any way I can avoid/prevent damaging/disrupting wood movement in the desktop?**  
I know buying quartersawn, or ripping the slap into quartersawn-ish boards would probably help, but if there's a way to get the full slab to work I feel that would look a lot more interesting visually.

**2. Are there any clever joining methods that would make the desktop easier to remove later for when we have to move the damn thing**.  
A lot of methods I've seen involve driving screws straight down through the top, filling with woodfiller, and then finishing over the screws. Obviously I don't want to destroy the finish to disassemble the desk.

Part of the reason I thought to use a full slab for that size is because of the weight, something like Oak in that size can get into the 70-80lb range and would hold itself in place pretty well, so I honestly considered just using some dominos and let the weight hold itself in place, but I wanted to ask the hive mind for tips and ideas, and to see just how far off my thinking is.

I love this forum. It’s great. Anyway, I’ve gone back and forth and back and forth over the years. Truth is, everyone thinks I am scary when I’m bald. It feels good physically, like I love the tennis ball feel and how easy it is. It’s never in your eyes. 

But the difference in how people react to me is immense and highly apparent. They think I’m a Nazi or a tweaker or something idk, but they do not like it. I have a harsh head shape maybe. The public, and in particular family and friends. Those closest to you will straight up call you ugly to your face, no joking, just like that. There’s a baby in the family and she literally refused to see me for a week after I shaved bald. I had to wear a hat or she would just cry without stopping. 

Anyway, it’s funny I’ve been taking estrogen for almost a full year now. It was always a joke I saw on here, the nuclear option so to speak. Turns out it’s mostly finasteride or minoxidil for the hair stuff. Estrogen helps other things, and the hair needs its own drugs. Lol, quite a few men are already on trans Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and we should all know that. You’re basically trans if you take the hair pills imo. 

For the longest time i just could not bear to see a photograph or reflection. I waffled on whether or not I was just being egotistical, maybe I was just a narcissist. Turns out I really just don’t want to exist as a man, and never have. As I got older, that became an impossible barrier in my life. I couldn’t really exist without addressing the discomfort, and now here we are. I’ve done a time of work to be able to feel “okay” with my appearance. I try to not give it as much thought. 

Maybe one day I will shave bald again. I’d like to own a home in the woods, with the goal being “able to wake up in the morning completely nude, walk outside, and not worry in any way shape or form about anything but my coffee.” I once baby sat a dog for a week in a remote cabin on the San Jaun islands, no neighbors for three miles.

This got me thinking about whether I should pivot to cloud engineering. 

It makes sense that there is more demand for cloud, since cloud engineers are more specialized and require certificates. The certificate probably makes you more valuable to a company, similar to accounting certificates or actuarial certificates. 

The main thing I was wondering about was whether the market actually demands more cloud engineers than software engineers, and whether senior engineers think it is a good idea to specialize so early in my career. ",3,1766861106.0,SoftwareEngineering,2,1.0,False

My local dunkin if i try asking for extra matcha will put actual shots of espresso (so i stopped ordering extra matcha).

I know starbucks changed their matcha this year, but i’ve gotten it a few times throughout the year from my boss and never noticed this before the last two weeks.

Are they accidentally adding espresso shots instead of matcha?

We used to enjoy going to the bar when we were first together but it has reduced greatly. Instead she turned to hard liquor and scared the ever loving crap out of me one night when she fell through a tempered glass coffee table. I still to this day have no idea how she didn’t cut herself to ribbons. Then not long after took quite a tumble that split her forehead/temple area open to the point she should’ve have gotten stitches. Now a nice scar on her head that will never go away. At this point I had a serious talk with her about her alcohol abuse and things seemed ok for a while. 

She switched to wine and then beer but always going too far. She can never seem to enjoy without becoming this entirely different personality. I despise this person she becomes and so again, another talk. Quieted down for a good time but then, back to it. 

We bought a house and work from home. In this time she gained about a hundred pounds and being the supportive male I tried to passively mention getting out more, being more healthy, trying to encourage better behavior without saying she’s gained enough weight to genuinely concern me. 

She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had it removed but never bothered to go back for the routine check ups. So inevitably it came back and attacked her other ovary. She promised me to get healthier after her dual surgeries as she acquired a hernia in this time as well. So now she’s healed from surgery and wouldn’t you know it, right back to drinking again. 

Ive tried to limit her to low abv’s and quantity of beers purchased to try and allow her some release from stress of work but it always comes back to her just getting more and more sucked in to high abv’s and bigger amounts purchased at a time. I built a new studio office to lounge and get away from her when she goes overboard as that personality she takes on is about as welcome as a dose of the clap. 

Last night, this personality came out again and I am just at my wits end. I think it best to completely ban alcohol in the house altogether. Also looking into local counseling to have it come from somewhere besides myself. I’m a guy who stands by his vows and love my wife but alcohol is seriously starting to erode that sentiment. She comes off as wanting to do better at first but we always come full circle after 6-10 weeks. 

I know I’m not the first person that this has happened to and hoping for some guidance from those who’ve experienced similar problems. Is counseling and the banning of alcohol the best first step? Thank you in advance for any advice guys. ",0,1766860830.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

The economy is like that.","I read this and had to share bc it is absolutely disgusting that we are living in such extreme hardship yet the USA is ‘supposed’ to be the strongest and ‘richest’ in the world (as per bullshit claims) - 

You turn on the news. The headlines are cheering, ""Unemployment is low!"" ""The Stock Market is at an all-time high!"" ""The Economy is Booming!"". You look at your bank account. You are drowning.

A deep sense of shame sets in. You think:
""If the economy is so good, why am I so broke?"" ""Why can't I save money?
Why is grocery shopping scary?
What is wrong with me?""

Stop. There is nothing wrong with you.
You are not crazy. You are experiencing The Macro/Micro Disconnect. (Some economists are calling this the ""Silent Depression"").

Economists measure inflation using a ""basket of goods."" But that basket is misleading.
It averages out everything from flat screen TVs to healthcare.

Here is the trick:
The price of Consumer Goods (TVs, toys, fast fashion, gadgets) has stayed relatively low.
It is easy to buy ""Stuff."" It is easy to distract yourself with cheap dopamine. But the price of Essentials (Housing, Childcare, Insurance, Food) has skyrocketed.
These are the things you actually need to stay alive and safe.

We live in a strange reality where:
You can easily afford a 55-inch 4K
TV. But you cannot afford a root canal. You can buy a mountain of clothes from Shein.
But you cannot afford a 1-bedroom apartment.

Financial experts used to say:
""Don't spend more than 30% of your income on rent."" For the median earner in 2024/2025, finding an apartment for 30% of their income is mathematically impossible in most cities.
The rule is broken because the system is broken.

The news says:
""Unemployment is low!"" But that number doesn't tell you quality of life.
If you need three ""gig economy"" jobs just to pay rent, you are technically ""employed.""
But you are also exhausted and impoverished.


When you hear ""The Economy is
Strong,"" what they mean is
""Corporations are Profitable.""
They do not mean ""Families are
Stable."" The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures money moving, not human happiness and comfort. 

Older generations (who lived in a cheaper economy) will tell you:
""Just cut out the daily coffee."" Do the math. Cutting a $5 coffee saves you $150 a month. Your rent went up by $600.
The coffee is not the problem.

This creates a state of Cognitive Dissonance.
You are being told you are safe (by the news). But your body feels unsafe (fight or flight at the grocery store).
This constant contradiction causes chronic anxiety and burnout.

You aren't ""bad with money.""
You are navigating a cost-of-living crisis that has outpaced wage growth for 20 years.
You are playing a rigged game.

1% refuses to allow the 99% to reach them for a reason. The economy might be ""rich.""

And I have no idea how to accept safety from someone, as it turns out.

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭

I’m single, own my condo in full after paying off the mortgage in 2019, work remotely in tech, and have a few side gigs that include running an Instagram account with a decent following (I do not like calling myself an “influencer” though, hah!); I used to do some dog walking/sitting which I pulled back on this year as my full time job became increasingly demanding. I’m happy to be debt-free and try my best to live frugally, mostly due to my upbringing as a first-generation immigrant and my desire to FIRE in some form or another.

# Income

**Post-Tax and Deduction Income: $152,650.18💰**

* I maxed out my pre-tax 401(k) and HSA contributions for the year, so this does not include those amounts, as well as the commuter FSA account contributions I made - a new corporate benefit! This also does not include any income from any of my investment accounts (dividends and interest) as they’re auto-reinvested.
* This consists of my post-tax and post-deduction base pay and annual bonus, HYSA + CD interest, annual parking lease payments (I have a parking spot I rent out because I don’t need a car in the NYC area), side gig income (social media), and gifts from my parents for my birthday and Christmas.

# Expenses: $35,627.31

**Taxes: $15,368.84 💸**

* Property Taxes: $11,466.85 - Higher than last year given annual tax increases. I live in a VHCOL area with the highest average property tax rate in the country, so this takes a hefty chunk of my expenses each year.
* Federal Taxes: $3,887.00 - Also higher than last year! Paid in February to the government when I filed my taxes for the previous year.
* FreetaxUSA: $14.99 - I finally switched over from Turbotax and saved a ton in filing my taxes; would definitely recommend it to others!

**Home: $6,387.36 🏠**

* HOA Dues: $4,906.00 - My monthly dues went up this year given the regular assessment / higher COL.
* Condo Insurance: $800 - Went up again this year; I did some price comparisons across a few other insurance firms though and found one with a cheaper policy that I’ll be switching to next year.
* Home Supplies: $428.91 - This is mostly Amazon purchases over the year and included various storage and cleaning supplies, air filters, trash bags, etc. My Dyson vacuum head also broke so I had to replace that at the start of the year, which took up the largest expense ($105) here.
* Furnishings: $244.23 - I finally updated my 10+ year old bedding, and spent on a down and wool comforter and cotton duvet sets for summer and winter. My sleep has definitely improved, so no regrets!
* Home Services: $0 - I had a ton of repair and maintenance work needed last year and this year was shockingly quiet! There were a few minor repairs/maintenance tasks that I took care of myself and are baked into the Home Supplies spending.

**Groceries: $4,486.81 🛒**

* I got more serious about managing my grocery budget after I noticed that my spending in the first half of the year was going up, mostly on snacks and convenience products, and became more deliberate about what I bought. My full year spend is now \~$500 less than last year and I’ve really only noticed benefits from doing so, as I buy more produce that’s in season, reduce food waste, and have cut back on snacks I don’t need (though I still allow myself some!)
* I don’t use any pick up or delivery services either, and don’t mind the walk to the grocery stores in my area - it’s actually an enjoyable chore for me, and I get some exercise out of it too!

**Gifts: $1,995.51 🎁**

* This category increased the most from last year (\~$600) but I have no qualms about it. These were largely gifts for my family: birthdays, Christmas, etc. and increased spending on my sister especially as she moved apartments. I bought my parents gifts separately as well as splitting joint purchases with my younger sister.
* I also treated a good friend to a Michelin-starred meal for his birthday this year, gifted friends a few small Christmas presents, and purchased gifts/food for friends for their birthdays as well.
* I donated $300 to local charities and organizations, including food pantries and animal rescues.

**Utilities: $1,667.15 💡**

* Gas & Electric: $814.72 - Went up a little versus last year (increased delivery fees, etc.)
* Internet: $713.00 - Also went up a little versus last year
* Cell Phone: $139.43 - My monthly bill is expensed through work, but I did trade in my iPhone 15 Pro for the iPhone 17 Pro this year, so paid some additional upgrade/exchange fees for this.

**Shopping: $1,470.73 🛍️**

* Clothing: $822.05 - I’d been planning to cut back on this versus last year’s clothing spending (\~$700) but I’m pretty satisfied with this amount. I finally switched over to Darn Tough socks and bought several summer and winter pairs (life-changing, no regrets), and purchased a Patagonia sweater + Lululemon workout tanks as well. Everything else consisted of thrifted clothing purchases, primarily through thredup and eBay, where I focused on the clothing material - I only purchased 100% natural fibers and found some great cotton, wool, and silk pieces that I’m so happy to have in my closet!
* Shopping: $338.30 - Unsurprisingly, mostly Amazon purchases here haha. Mostly non-essential home goods (water bottles, decor/storage items, etc.), stationary, etc.
* Electronics: $274.05 - The bulk of this was two Nintendo Switch games I got for myself, as well as some other items like an ergonomic wireless mouse and a new mechanical keyboard and keycaps.
* Books: $36.33 - I usually borrow ebooks for my Kindle, but had a couple books I wanted the physical copies of that I bought secondhand from eBay.

**Dining & Drinks: $1,402.52 🍽️**

* I don’t drink, so this is all food or coffee!
* Restaurants: $1,021.44 - Because of my social media side gig, I get invited with a guest to restaurants in my city and am responsible for leaving gratuity for the staff. I’ll dine out for this on average 2 meals/week. This is largely the tip that I've left this year
* Dining (Other): $351.12 - I put more casual meals in this category, so this includes some quick sit down/fast casual meals with friends, dumplings/baos in Chinatown, etc.
* Cafes: $26.57 - The very infrequent coffee I get that I don’t make at home haha; most of these were on my Thanksgiving trek by train to and from home.
* Fast Food: $3.39 - I had a very rare craving for a McChicken lol and McDonald’s was offering a promo for free fries with purchase.

**Fitness: $1,018.66 🏋🏻‍♂️**

* I increased the number of workout (barre & mat pilates) classes at my local fitness studio, so upgraded my monthly Classpass plan! This was an area I didn’t spend any money on up until a couple years ago, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve made and the physical and mental benefits I’ve gotten!

**Personal Care: $599.75 💇🏻‍♀️**

* Hair: $226.49 - I get my hair cut twice a year, so both the base cost + tip is captured here. I also bought a refill of leave-in conditioner ($6.49). My dad generously still gives me the bulk shampoo and conditioner bottles from Costco so I didn't have to buy those!
* Skincare: $168.57 - Mostly replacements/refills for my regular skincare products (cleanser, serums, moisturizer, and SPF). My skin got really dry this year so ordered some new products as well.
* Laundry: $110.00 - The laundry machines in my building now take a new mobile payment system, and the average cost per load went up about $1 this year as well.
* Spa: $87.83 - Treated myself to my first-ever facial as a belated birthday gift for myself! This included the tip and I got a handful of samples to take home!
* Nails: $6.76 - A new pair of nail clippers after my original one broke lol

**Auto & Transport: $320.60 🚊**

* Public Transit: $311.60 - My company just began offering a commuter benefit (transit FSA account) in Q1 of this year, so I still spent on train/subway rides for a few months. I now expense these using my pre-tax transit FSA dollars!
* Rideshare: $9 - I never take Ubers/taxis except for work travel, but I joined a new book club this year and the holiday party was at a very hard-to-get-to location that required multiple transfers and 1.5 hours of commuting one way. I split an Uber back with two of the girls who lived close to me - well worth it!

**Fees & Charges: $279.79 💲**

* Fees & Charges: $179.08 - A lot of my monthly and annual subscription fees fall here, including Apple Storage, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. I did cancel my Hulu/Spotify and Amazon Prime subscriptions given the limited benefit and use I got out of them, and snagged a discounted plan for Quicken Simplifi as well.
* Service Fees: $95 - This is the annual fee for my AmEx CC
* Shipping Fees: $5.71 - On a work trip, I left my Kindle in my hotel room and only found out after I was at the airport! The hotel staff kindly shipped it back to me after I purchased a shipping label.

**Everything Else: $629.59  💊🎥**

* Health: $262.68 - This is mostly my daily vitamins and supplements and includes some first aid and pharmacy spending, such as antibiotics and eye drops
* Entertainment: $227.51-  Includes a couple movie theater tickets, museum tickets, local shows/stand-ups, and entry fees to local events!
* Travel: $75.44 - My family and I took our first-ever family vacation at the start of this year, which my parents covered the primary costs of. There were a couple of ad hoc costs (bus tickets, an excursion, etc.) that I covered during those days.
* Work Expenses: $63.96 - Adobe Creative Cloud, which I use for one of my side gigs. Will be logged as a business expense.

# Conclusion

Looking at this year’s spending in comparison to last year’s spending was rewarding and I’m satisfied with it, esp as my total annual spending decreased. Evaluating my goals from last year:

* *Cancel my Amazon Prime subscription and only make purchases when I get free shipping (on $35+). Reduce unnecessary/impulse purchases and be more intentional about what I buy.* Done: My Shopping spend decreased from last year, I cancelled/downgraded a number of subscriptions including Prime, and I also minimized the Home Supplies categories (which admittedly includes some non-essentials). I made fewer impulse purchases at the grocery store as well, which led to less food waste and overall healthier eating.
* *Cut back clothing spending to as close as $0 as possible and buy secondhand if it’s an option.* Not Done: I do think this goal last year wasn’t realistic or necessary, and I focused more on quality over quantity of clothing pieces, leaning heavily into secondhand. I have some pieces I really like and enjoy wearing that I know will last longer as well.
* *Try to embrace spending on things like travel and experiences; I have a lot of guilt/financial anxiety on spending on things in this category, but want to remind myself it’s ok to do so.* Done, Sort Of. I was fortunate enough to have my parents cover my expenses on our first family vacation; this was a big deal for them as all of us except my younger sister are first generation immigrants to the US, so still carry some financial anxiety from those earlier years. I’d like to do some solo travel, even if it's fairly local, as it’s something I want to do and appreciate more.

My goals for 2026:

1. Continue spending generously on the people and things that matter to me. I was actually really happy to see my Gift spending go up this year, as being frugal is all about spending on what you value (and spending less on what you don’t).
2. Continue trying new things and spending on activities, events, and groups.
3. Stop sweating the small things. I’m on an ongoing journey of better managing my financial anxiety, but I do think I’ve made a lot of improvements in my attitude towards money and spending, especially on non-essentials and “fun” things. ",30,1766860564.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,4,0.92,False

1px4z74,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingUncertainty/comments/1px4z74/the_coffee_swap_and_the_homeoffice_barista/,"The ""Coffee Swap"" and the Home-Office Barista","In 2024, we joked about the $7 latte. In 2026, with the ""triple-threat"" of climate-impacted bean harvests, specialized milk surcharges, and the ubiquitous 22% tip prompt, that joke has become a painful line item on our bank statements.



The response in 2026 isn't to give up caffeine—it’s the Home-Office Barista Pivot. We are seeing a massive shift toward ""Prosumer"" home setups where the initial investment is high, but the Return on Investment (ROI) is shockingly fast. If you’re a daily latte drinker, your equipment doesn't just ""pay for itself""—it starts earning you money before the season is out.



1. The 2026 Math: Cafe vs. Countertop

Let’s look at the cold, caffeinated numbers. By 2026, the average price of a specialty latte (with tax and tip) has hovered around $7.50.



The Annual Cafe Habit (1 drink/day)

Daily Cost: $7.50



Monthly Cost: $225.00



Annual Cost: $2,737.50



The Home Barista Cost (Variable)

High-Quality Beans: $0.90 per double shot (buying $18/12oz specialty bags)



Milk/Alternative: $0.45 per drink



Electricity/Water: $0.05 per drink



Total Variable Cost: $1.40 per latte



2. The ROI Calculation: Slaying the ""Bambino"" Barrier

To get cafe-quality microfoam and a true 9-bar extraction at home, you need more than a drip machine. In 2026, the ""Gold Standard"" entry setup is a semi-automatic machine like the Breville Bambino Plus ($499) paired with a dedicated conical burr grinder ($200).



Total Investment: $700.00 (including a tamper and scale)



The Break-Even Point:



Savings per Drink: $7.50 (Cafe) - $1.40 (Home) = $6.10 saved per day



ROI Formula: $700 investment / $6.10 daily savings = 114.7 days



The Verdict: In just under four months, your high-end machine is paid for. For the remaining eight months of the year, you are effectively ""earning"" $183 a month in avoided costs.



3. 2026 Tech: AI and ""Precision Extraction""

The reason more people are switching in 2026 is that the ""learning curve"" has vanished.



Sensor-Driven Tamping: New 2026 models from De'Longhi and Breville feature ""assisted tamping,"" ensuring the perfect pressure every time.



AI Brew Assistants: Apps now sync with your grinder via Bluetooth. They scan your bag of beans, check the local humidity, and tell you exactly which ""click"" to set your grinder to for a perfect 25-second pull.



Auto-Frothing Evolution: You no longer need to be a latte art pro. 2026 steam wands use infrared sensors to stop at the exact temperature for oat, almond, or dairy milk, creating ""wet paint"" texture with one button.



4. Shopping the ""Second-Shot"" Market

Because many people over-invested in hobby gear during the mid-2020s, 2026 is a goldmine for the Refurbished Economy.



Certified Refurbished: Buying a ""like-new"" machine directly from the manufacturer can drop your initial investment by 30%, shortening your ROI to less than 90 days.



Marketplace Scores: Check local ""Coffee Enthusiast"" forums. As baristas upgrade to ""End-game"" machines (the $3,000+ units), you can often snag a pro-level Gaggia or Rancilio for $300.



Your ""Switch"" Checklist

Audit Your App: Check your banking app for ""Starbucks,"" ""Dunkin,"" or ""Local Cafe"" for the last 30 days. That number is your monthly ""Coffee Tax.""



Start with the Grinder: If you can't afford the whole setup, buy the grinder first. Freshly ground beans in a $20 Moka Pot will beat a $7 cafe latte 9 times out of 10.



The ""Milk Pivot"": If you use expensive oat milk, buy the ""Barista Editions"" in bulk cases of 6 or 12 to drop your home cost-per-cup even further.",1,1766860475.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭

So I've been using OpenAlgo (open source algo trading platform) for a while and always wanted a way to build trading workflows without writing code every time. Like, I just want to say ""when NIFTY crosses 26000, buy this, send me a telegram message"" without opening VS Code.

https://preview.redd.it/qpluwkcnis9g1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf29054c12cc5076bfe47d4a191ff26d010f2f07

Last week I decided to actually build it. But instead of spending weeks on it, I tried something different - I used Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool with the new Opus 4.5 model).

Honestly? I was skeptical. But 8 hours later I had a working product with 30+ features.

The way it works is pretty simple - you just describe what you want, Claude writes the code, you test it, find bugs, paste the error, Claude fixes it. Rinse and repeat. It's like having a really fast developer sitting next to you who doesn't need coffee breaks.

What blew my mind was that it actually understood trading stuff. Like I said ""add support for Iron Condor strategy"" and it knew that meant 4 legs, knew about OTM strikes, handled the lot sizes correctly. I didn't have to explain what an Iron Condor is.

https://preview.redd.it/7po7g7tqis9g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=93da57cbf81529f377550334d6bda23572c2e1e4

The tool itself is basically n8n/Zapier but for trading. You drag boxes onto a canvas, connect them, and that's your strategy. Want to run something at 9:15 AM every day? There's a schedule trigger. Want to react to price movements in real-time? There's a price alert that uses websockets. Want to connect TradingView alerts? There's a webhook trigger.

Is it perfect? No. I'm still finding bugs and adding features. But the fact that I went from zero to a working product in 8 hours is insane to me. This would have taken me weeks doing it the traditional way.

Anyway, it's completely open source if anyone wants to check it out or contribute.

My siblings in law host a family gathering every year sometime around Christmas. My husband and I travel every year to attend. We were unable to attend last year because I had a major medical incident and was hospitalized the day before the gathering. 

Obviously my husband kept his siblings informed on our situation and let them know when I was home from the hospital. After about a week of being home, I realized my SIL never reached out to me. I brushed it off assuming she was giving me space to recover. Between work and rehab, I was dialed in on my shit and it was a few months before I realized SIL still hadn’t reached out at all. Not even a text saying “hey, glad I didn’t have to go to your funeral.” And that realization hurt to the core. 

I don’t enjoy confrontation but I grew the balls to text SIL and ask if I’d angered her or if there was a particular reason she hasn’t reached out. She read my text that day. But she didn’t respond. That crushed me again. A week later she called but I didn’t answer because I was hurt and honestly mad at her. She left a message asking me to call back but I just didn’t. Feelings and all. So there was radio silence… for almost a year now. 

She called again a couple weeks ago and this time I was unable to answer because I was in a meeting. She left another message saying she’s knows I’m mad at her but please call. I haven’t. I feel the only reason she reached out again is because she knew the family gathering was coming soon. Over the year I’ve come to the conclusion that I made assumptions about our relationship and that she didn’t feel the same about me. I truly thought we were close. That’s fine, I just feel like an idiot for thinking I got the little sister I always wanted with her. 

I’m in therapy and I’ve talked about this with my therapist. I acknowledge that I could solve this by calling right now and having a conversation. But the truth is I’m still super hurt. She should have reached out when I got out of the hospital. It wasn’t my responsibility to do that. And if I call her, I’m very sure I’m going to hear some lame excuses about why she didn’t. And I don’t want to hear it. I’m not mad, I’m hurt. Deeply. I mean, coworkers that I don’t speak to regularly reached out when they heard. 

My husband is aware of all of this. I’ve asked him to not get involved as I don’t want to cause strife between him and his siblings. He has talked to both of his siblings throughout the year. His brother texted him the date of the gathering. It’s coming in the next couple weeks. He’s told me I don’t have to attend. And I really don’t want to. First of all, my anxiety is through the roof. I’m supposed to be managing stress and I’m not succeeding with the anniversary of my medical event looming. I’m legitimately spiraling and just trying to keep it together. 

I don’t know what to do here. On one hand, I feel I should suck it up and attend. But on the other hand, I feel my presence would be too distracting. There will definitely be tension and potential for an argument that could get heated. There will be kids there who are old enough to understand what’s happening. I don’t want to be the reason for weirdness. And I’m not looking to be the center of attention when they all start asking about my health. They haven’t cared for a year. Yes, I could call my SIL right now and hear her out. But I’m truly not in the right headspace. I really want to skip this gathering and crawl in a hole until spring. I know my attitude is probably passive aggressive but I’m trying to protect my peace and set boundaries for myself which is something I’ve never done so I’m still learning. I don’t know what I’m doing and I’m not sure I want to repair the relationship with any of them. Am I being unreasonable if I don’t attend?

[GBP 1000],"Hi, I'm looking for advice on buying an espresso machine. I have an automatic coffee maker (Philips 5500), but I'm not quite satisfied with the coffee it makes. I'd like to move towards a more manual process and experiment a little: ideally being able to control all relevant parameters according to the ""golden rule"" (\~18 g of input, \~36 g of output, 90-96 degrees and 9 bar at the group head). I figure once I can get consistent results, I'll be able to see true differences when I change some parameter, or beans, or roast etc. 

So, what machine would you recommend? I'm in the UK, the budget is around 1k (not including a grinder if needed). I almost always drink espresso, my wife prefers milk varieties (cappucino, latte macchiato), together we drik around 6 coffees a day. I have zero experience in pulling shots (as opposed to pressing buttons on an automatic), but I'm not scared of steep learning curves. Size might be a bit of a concern, so I'd prefer something small.

We were a party of 4 and stayed at the Grand Helios for the days that we went to Epic.

9:30 - Arrived at VIP stand at the front of the park after getting coffee at Starbucks. We were led upstairs and offered water and snacks, which included bags of pretzels and granola bars, and sunscreen. We were assigned our guide and our group, which was 12 people total. 

10:00 - Finished Ministry. We went through the exit. The screen broke down the first time Dolores Umbridge appears, but we weren't offered a re-ride. I sat in the back right to allow other, more motion-sickness prone members of my party to have the center, and I did end up feeling a bit queasy but I was fine on it during later re-rides. Being closer to the center helps. 

10:30 - Finished our first ride on Stardust. 

11:00 - Finished Frankenstein

11:15 - Finished Werewolf 

11:30 - Break. We had a 30 minute break at Frosty Moon. I had the strawberry yum with strawberry cheesecake sprinkles and star sprinkles. It was quite good! Since we were right by the hotel, I also took 5 minutes to drop off our sweatshirts that we had on in the morning back in the room.  Definitely a perk of staying onsite. 

12 - resumed tour, and our guide let us know that both Hiccups and Donkey Kong were still down (they had been down all day), but he was keeping in touch with the other guides so he would know when/if they came back up. We went to Berk and rode Dragon Racers Rally, again entering through the exit. 

12:30 - Mario Kart Bowser's challenge, again through the exit. 

At this point Hiccups and Donkey Kart were still down, so we went for another ride on Stardust on the yellow track this time. Then we rode Yoshi's to finish the tour at 1:30. 

Our VIP lanyards served as one-time use express passes for the rest of the day, so we held out hope that the rides would come back up and we would be able to ride them at least once. But it definitely felt like we didn't get as much value out of the tour as we could have with them being down all morning. 

After the tour, we had lunch at Cafe de la Sirene (the quiche, Butterbeer crepe, and plum juice were fantastic) and then I bought my kids Gen 2 wands and they did spells for a bit while we had drinks from Bar Moonshine. Then we saw the Cirque Arcanus show. The preshow went down about midway, the screens just went black. The actor didn't seem surprised and disappeared for a bit, and about 15 minutes later they were able to resume the show. The show itself was fine, but having Express pass didn't give us much of an advantage with seating and we ended up pretty far to the side. 

After the show we saw that DK Mine Cart had finally come back online so we hurried over there and waited about 10 minutes in the express line. We also had our power up bands and did some of the activities in that area. Hiccups never came up all day. 

We rode Ministry again, the regular line was 140 minutes and we waited again about 10. Then we went back to Nintendo land and did the games including Bowser Jr's challenge, and rode Mario Kart again using express. There were no waits for the games at night. We finished the day by having dinner at Yoshi's cafe and riding Yoshi's too see a view of the park lit up at night. 

It was a 12 hour day and we were exhausted by the end. Was it worth the cost? It's hard to say. The following day we had a regular express pass, which was less than half the cost of the VIP tour, and felt like we still accomplished a lot, including finally riding Hiccups Wing Gliders, seeing the Untrainable Dragon show, and meeting Toothless. 

For our family, the tour was worth doing once. We picked an insanely busy week for our first trip and the park was mobbed. Ministry often had 240 minute waits, Mario Kart was often at 120 minutes and DK and Hiccups often had 80-90 minute waits. Some friends of ours did their tour the following day and got more out of it because DK and Hiccups were up all day. But now that we know our way around the park and crowd patterns to avoid, I don't think we would do it again. We did get 10% off gift shop purchases and used that on the wands and some t-shirts in Nintendo land. 

In the future, I think I would instead opt to bring the family during a slower time of year, like late January, and just come for a long weekend instead of a full week including IOA and UO. We've done those parks plenty of times in the past and we were worn out after a full 5 days in the parks.  We would still stay onsite - Helios was absolutely worth it. 

Hope this is helpful for anyone planning their trips! ",8,1766860072.0,UniversalEpicUniverse,5,0.91,False

1️⃣ Why the P2P narrative causes confusion

Many Kaspa holders think:

“If Kaspa isn’t used to buy coffee, it failed.”

That’s the Bitcoin-2011 mental model.

But in reality:
	•	Even Bitcoin is not used directly for most payments
	•	Finance evolved toward layers
	•	High-value systems settle, low-value systems transact

Kaspa doesn’t lose if it’s not P2P retail cash.
Bitcoin didn’t lose either.

⸻

2️⃣ The layered model (this is the key)

Layer 1 – Settlement asset
	•	What everyone ultimately trusts
	•	What balances are denominated in

➡️ Bitcoin

⸻

Layer 2 – Settlement rails
	•	Move value quickly and predictably
	•	Used constantly
	•	Net out balances

➡️ Kaspa (potentially)

⸻

Layer 3 – Payment & app layers
	•	UX
	•	Instant payments
	•	Apps
	•	Custodians, Lightning, L2s

➡️ Everything else

⸻

3️⃣ How Bitcoin and Kaspa actually coexist

Bitcoin’s role
	•	Final settlement
	•	Ultimate collateral
	•	Long-term store of value
	•	Minimal change

Bitcoin is slow on purpose.

⸻

Kaspa’s role
	•	Fast PoW movement
	•	Neutral infrastructure
	•	High-frequency settlement
	•	No governance capture

Kaspa doesn’t need:
	•	Retail usage
	•	NFTs
	•	DeFi casinos

It needs:
	•	Institutions
	•	Exchanges
	•	Infrastructure providers

⸻

4️⃣ Simple analogy that clicks

Think in banking terms
	•	Gold = Bitcoin
	•	Fedwire = Bitcoin base layer
	•	A faster interbank rail = Kaspa

Banks don’t move gold constantly.
They:
	1.	Move balances on rails
	2.	Net positions
	3.	Settle in gold occasionally

Same idea.

⸻

5️⃣ Why Kaspa holders miss this

Because narratives lag reality

Crypto culture still focuses on:
	•	Payments
	•	“Mass adoption”
	•	Coffee purchases

But finance actually cares about:
	•	Risk
	•	Finality
	•	Simplicity
	•	Neutrality

Kaspa fits finance, not coffee shops.

⸻

6️⃣ Why Kaspa does NOT threaten Bitcoin

Kaspa:
	•	Does not replace BTC as money
	•	Does not steal store-of-value demand
	•	Does not weaken Bitcoin’s security model

It reduces Bitcoin’s operational load, which actually helps Bitcoin.

⸻

7️⃣ One-sentence truth (the mental unlock)

Bitcoin is where value ultimately lives.
Kaspa is how value can move efficiently without compromising that.

That’s coexistence, not competition.

Why Kaspa is unusually suited to be a rail

✔ One shared state
	•	No shards
	•	No rollups
	•	No internal bridges

Everyone sees the same truth quickly.

⸻

✔ PoW neutrality
	•	No validator governance
	•	No slashing politics
	•	No human override layer

Rules don’t change mid-game.

⸻

✔ Speed without trust tradeoffs

Kaspa is fast because of parallel blocks, not because someone is trusted.

That matters for institutions.

⸻

What Kaspa is not trying to be

Kaspa does not need to be:
	•	Store of value
	•	Unit of account
	•	Retail currency

Those roles naturally converge on Bitcoin.

Kaspa’s role is:

“Neutral, high-speed value movement that nobody argues about.”

1px4oo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/recurrentmiscarriage/comments/1px4oo2/shame/,Shame,"I’m recovering from a d&c for my second MMC this year. The first d&c in February left retained products that were removed via hysteroscopy in July. We got pregnant again immediately in September after being cleared by our RE. We lost both pregnancies around 6 weeks, discovered both at 9-10 week ultrasounds. I love our family and friends, and I’m very fortunate to have a deep bench of people to lean on, chiefly my husband (and therapist). However, I feel so much shame for some reason. Just, I feel like this deep shame for having lost two pregnancies. It’s not rational, I know, but I feel ashamed and alienated for feeling hopeful, for being unable to carry as of yet. 

With our first pregnancy, we told all our friends and family immediately, so my first MMC felt like a public spectacle. Everyone offering their condolences…but also expecting a full report or throwing in their two cents about the potential causes. I felt like a leper, everyone accusing me of doing things to put distance between the loss and themselves like “well \*we\* would never to that so it wouldn’t happen to us.” People asked if my commute or work stress caused it. If being on birth control for so long caused it. The trauma of the publicity and constant speculation (like my pain was just a fun conversation topic for people) was exacerbated by 6 months of excruciating retained products. So, for our second pregnancy we told only our parents and my sister (my closest friend). The loss is more manageable now knowing people aren’t speculating, but I’ve had retained products again after 3 rounds of misoprostol, which necessitated the d&c. This means I missed all the thanksgiving and holiday festivities…including my own birthday. All our friends are asking if I’m pregnant since they haven’t seen us in a while. The shame just keeps building. Has anyone else felt ashamed about the recurrent pregnancy loss? Even if you know you have no reason to be? 

Also, has anyone had success after lifestyle changes? My husband was a heavy drinker (around 14 per week, sometimes more, rarely less) and heavy nicotine user before both prior pregnancies. I don’t drink or use nicotine in any form. Neither one of us uses thc, he drinks a bit of coffee but not much. In November he quit all alcohol and nicotine after our second loss. I just turned 30 a couple days ago and he’s 37. His SA showed 4% morphology (up from 2% a year ago) with 778 million. This could indicate inflammation but our RE refuses to do fragmentation testing. Anyway, has anyone else had success after cutting out alcohol and/or nicotine? ",4,1766859765.0,recurrentmiscarriage,7,0.84,False

Cost wise I am ok with both resorts, base room at Atelier is about $3700 through Costco travel and Valentin Golden Superior Room is $3600 for 5 nights total, so cost isn’t a factor for me. 

I want to see if anyone has been to both or has general advice. We aren’t huge drinkers but enjoy a good beer and cocktail, a handful a day. We like good food but aren’t food snobs by any means. We are beach people but also enjoy a lively pool (music, dancing, etc.). I would say based on my own research, we are considering the following pros for each resort:

**Valentin**

\- Large resort with everything spread out. This is a plus for us, I enjoy walking and would prefer my pool time isn’t staring at people on their balcony. 

\- Activities - Seems like there is more activities based on their schedule 

\- Pool/Beach - The beach seems like it’s easier to get a good seat in front of the water based on their layout. Pool is larger and has more seating, sounds like it’s less competitive in terms of saving chairs. 

\- Nightlife - Music/DJs every night after dinner. 

**Atelier** 

**-** Food - Everyone seems to say this is top of the line food for Mexico AI’s.

\- Drinks - Sounds like the cocktails and mixologists are another level over typical resorts. 

\- Coffee - More options and real espresso machines, Valentin coffee shop uses Nespresso pods. 

\- Room - Looks a bit more modern for the price range. 

 \- Isle Mujheres - While there are less activities, we’d definitely gander over to the isle. 

Again, this is all based on research via TripAdvisor, YouTube videos and Reddit. I don’t think we can go wrong with either resort but I am really torn right now so any insight is appreciated. ",1,1766859689.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False

I’m considering moving to California after graduating from grad school and wanted some honest input. I’d be making around \~$100k, single, late 20s female. I’ve always wanted to live in CA, but the cost of living has held me back. That said, I’m at a point where I’m willing to accept the trade-offs if it’s the right fit.

I’m Asian and would really like to live in or near a strong Asian community. I’m also very into food and café culture—good restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, etc. Having access to “third places” is important to me (walkable areas, cafés, parks, libraries, community spaces), not just work → home → repeat.

Safety is a big priority for me as a woman living alone. I also value good weather and scenery—doesn’t have to be beaches, but I’d love somewhere that feels pleasant to be outside (trees, hills, views, etc.).

I know $100k doesn’t go far everywhere in CA, so I’m trying to be realistic. I don’t need luxury—just somewhere livable, relatively safe, culturally vibrant, and not completely isolating. I’m open to both SoCal and NorCal.

Would really appreciate recommendations (or warnings) from people who’ve made a similar move.",3,1766859663.0,MovingToLosAngeles,24,0.8,False

There was a long dark grey column down the left side of the site with all the categories using white text if it helps. On this site, there was a café game that was really cute and chill that I hope I can find again.

This game was a management café game where you play as these two girls, both with very natural hair colours and if I'm remembering right their hair was brown. The eyes of the girls were small dots like I drew I think? The same goes for the hairstyles, the girls looked similar but they had slight differences.

The art style was very simple and flat, but I distinctly remember the colours of the game being quite muted and grey/purple. The image above is what it looked like to me from memory, it even might've been a bit pixelated and lower quality, something to akin to an rpgmaker game with a higher resolution. I remember the UI of the game also being between a very muted purple or a very muted brown. The game had a very specific desaturated and minimalistic aesthetic, part of me wants to say it was a game based in Korea or Japan but I cannot pinpoint exactly why. I think it might've been because either the logo or some of the text of the game had unreadable text to me as a Kid and that's because it was in either Korean or Japanese? I also have a feeling the names of the two girls didn't have English sounding names but I could be completely wrong. It would make sense though considering I remember seeing quite a lot of Eastern-Asian flash games on a lot of the sites I would frequent that were fun.

In this game, you used the little notepad Infront of the girl to choose what you would serve to your customers, I recall some of the drinks being: Hot chocolate, Water, Tea, Coffee (multiple kinds too I think). And then I remember there being cookies you could make too? All these designs were very basic, they weren't cartoony in any way or stylized to be colourful or pretty, they just looked like regular foods and drinks on plates and in basic cups. You could tell the girls to do specific tasks like cleaning the tables and floors, washing dishes, being the cashier, making the food etc. You most likely did this by clicking on them.

One of the distinct mechanics I remember is that there was a stress meter for the two girls running the café. You could give them the option to go on break every so often where they would leave the café through a door either at the back of the counter or to the side (In the drawing I made its on the side, but I believe it might've just been behind the counter) I don't remember what would happen If their stress got too high, I don't think the game had any specific punishments for over-stressing them.

Overall I remember the game being extremely calming, especially since the music was very gentle sounding. Pretty sure the music used a lot of soft piano and that's why it calmed me as a kid. I think I remember there being gentle twinkle/crystal sound effects in the music too, overall very lofi-esque? Honestly I think this game might've been before it's time if I'm remembering it correctly.

Hopefully this game can be found so I can revisit it, it was such a gentle and relaxing game. I hope it hasn't been lost to time (And i kind of hope the website I found it on isn't either). Thank you!",2,1766859553.0,tipofmyjoystick,1,1.0,False
1px4llj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1px4llj/how_to_subtly_attract_your_crush_without_being/,How to Subtly Attract Your Crush Without Being Cringe: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I've spent way too much time researching attraction psychology because honestly, watching people fumble around their crushes is painful. Not just for them but for everyone within a 10 foot radius. The awkward compliments, the try-hard energy, the desperation that practically radiates off them. 

Here's what most people get wrong: they think attraction is about grand gestures or being someone they're not. It's exhausting to watch and even worse to experience. So I dove into legit research, evolutionary psychology studies, relationship science podcasts, and honestly some embarrassingly deep rabbit holes on human behavior. What I found actually makes sense when you strip away all the rom com BS we've been fed.

The thing is, attraction isn't random. There's actual science behind why certain behaviors work and others make people run for the hills. It's not about manipulating anyone, it's about understanding how humans naturally respond to certain cues and using that knowledge to show up as your most attractive self.

**The proximity effect is stupidly powerful.** There's this concept called ""mere exposure"" that psychologist Robert Zajonc researched extensively. Basically, people develop preferences for things they're familiar with. Not in a stalker way, but strategic consistent presence. Be where your crush is naturally. Same coffee shop study sessions, same friend group hangouts, same gym classes. You're not chasing, you're just existing in their orbit consistently. The key is making it feel natural, not forced. Your brain starts associating positive feelings with familiar faces without even realizing it. It's why coworkers develop feelings, why gym crushes happen, why people fall for their friends. Repetition builds comfort, comfort builds attraction.

**Create positive associations through subtle rewards.** This ties into behavioral psychology and conditioning, which sounds clinical but it's genuinely how our brains work. When you interact with your crush, be the person who makes them feel good about themselves. Not through obvious flattery that screams desperation, but through genuine engagement. Ask about things they care about and actually listen. Remember small details they mentioned and bring them up later. Psychologist Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness found that mutual vulnerability and feeling understood are massive attraction triggers. When someone makes you feel seen and valued, your brain releases dopamine. They start unconsciously seeking you out because you've become associated with feeling good.

**Master the art of strategic unavailability.** The book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller breaks down attachment theory in relationships, and one insight is that secure people maintain their own lives while dating. They're not constantly available because they have their own shit going on. This isn't playing games, it's having genuine self respect and boundaries. Don't always be free when they text. Have plans. Have hobbies. Have a life that's interesting without them. Scarcity increases perceived value, this is basic economics applied to human psychology. When you're always available, you signal low options and desperation. When you're selective with your time, you signal that your attention is valuable.

If you want to dive deeper into relationship psychology and social skills, BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. You type in what you want to learn, like improving social dynamics or understanding attraction patterns, and it pulls from verified sources to create custom podcasts tailored to your pace. You can choose quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with real examples. 

It also builds an adaptive learning plan based on your goals, so if you're working on confidence or communication skills, it keeps evolving with you. Plus there's a virtual coach you can chat with about specific situations. The voice options are genuinely addictive, I've been using the sarcastic style lately. Way better than doomscrolling when you actually want to level up.

**Physical mirroring builds subconscious connection.** Social psychology research shows that subtle mimicry of body language creates rapport and likability. If they lean in, you lean in slightly. If they cross their legs, you might do the same after a beat. Don't copy everything like a weird robot, but gentle mirroring signals ""we're on the same wavelength."" The podcast ""The Science of Success"" did an entire episode on nonverbal communication and how mirroring activates mirror neurons in the brain, creating feelings of connection and trust. It's why people in love naturally mirror each other without thinking about it. You're essentially hacking that process.

**The psychology of touch is insanely underrated.** Obviously within appropriate boundaries, but light casual touch creates intimacy. A hand on their arm when you're laughing at their joke. A brief shoulder touch when you're walking past. Touch releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone. Research from DePauw University found that even brief touches increase compliance and positive feelings toward the person doing the touching. You're not groping them, you're creating small moments of physical connection that register subconsciously. Most people are touch starved and don't even realize it.

**Use the Benjamin Franklin effect strategically.** This is wild but research backed. Ask your crush for small favors. Not big imposing requests, but little things like ""can you grab me a coffee while you're up"" or ""mind sending me that article you mentioned."" The psychology is counterintuitive but people rationalize doing favors by convincing themselves they must like the person they're helping. It's cognitive dissonance resolution. They're more likely to develop positive feelings toward you because ""why would I help them if I didn't like them?"" The book ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini covers this principle extensively.

**Create shared secrets and inside jokes.** According to research on relationship formation, shared unique experiences bond people faster than generic interactions. When you have jokes or references only the two of you understand, it creates an ""us versus them"" dynamic that's incredibly bonding. Psychologically, it signals special connection. You're building a miniature world that only exists between you two. Even something small like a funny observation about your weird professor or a dumb meme that cracked you both up becomes this thread connecting you.

**Strategic compliments that aren't about looks.** Everyone compliments appearance. It's lazy and forgettable. Compliment their mind, their choices, their energy. ""I love how passionate you get when you talk about X"" or ""your perspective on that was actually really insightful."" This communicates that you're paying attention to who they are, not just what they look like. It's also way less threatening and try hard. Research on compliments shows that personality based compliments are perceived as more genuine and create stronger positive associations than physical ones.

Look, none of this guarantees your crush will fall madly in love with you because attraction is complex and sometimes the chemistry just isn't there. But these strategies stack the odds in your favor by working with human psychology instead of against it. You're not being fake, you're being strategic about showing up as your most attractive self. There's a difference between manipulation and understanding how to connect with people effectively. The goal isn't to trick someone into liking you, it's to create conditions where genuine attraction can develop naturally.

Started on estrogen patch 3 weeks ago. Week one- 1/2 patch, week two- 3/4 patch, and week three- full patch (0.025mg). Ever since increasing to the full patch I’m having severe physical anxiety, like I’ve drank 10 cups of coffee, my insides feel like they’re vibrating. Today I’m noticing tremors in my hands. I’m lightheaded and my legs feel like noodles. Basically stuck in bed afraid to stand up or walk & feeling like my life is over at 42 years old. 

A little background: I had my thyroid removed just over a year ago due to hyperthyroidism caused by toxic nodules. Took me almost a year to get my thyroid dose dialed in. Then I had my hysterectomy & BSO in September this year which completely derailed my thyroid stability while throwing me into menopause at the same time. I didn’t start estrogen right away because I needed to be cleared by neurology (due to migraines w/ aura) and get my thyroid levels back in range. That took about 3 months. 

Does estrogen cause anyone else severe physical anxiety that makes it impossible to function? Anyone else here in surgical menopause and without a thyroid? Could 0.025mg E patch be too much? I know it’s a small dose but I feel worse now than I did when on no estrogen at all. This is just awful. ",5,1766859540.0,Menopause,15,1.0,False

Diagnosed about 1 year ago, since July on Vyvanse (or as we call it, Elvanse in Europe). I started with 20 mg, then 30, then 40 and now I have both 30 and 40 at home. I have/had some history with subclinical anxiety, no depression though (quite the contrary to be honest). 

Coffee and caffeine has been a very steady love hate relationship, quite borderline to some extent. I used to and still do drink loooots of coffee (wonder where this might come from?!) and I’m relatively confident that it played an important role in this whole anxiety issue (who might have thought??). It is fair to say that I have some form of coffee addiction and some people around me already noticed that I drink a lot and also keep asking about their consumption (which is almost always lower than mine). My father i.e. drinks one cup of coffee in the morning and one in the afternoon, occasionally one in between but it has no particular effect on him. I definitely can’t say that caffeine has no effect on me like so many others with ADHD. I have some tolerance though. 

I drink coffee quite ‘mindlessly’ and lately I drink about 3 up to 3,5 cups before noon WITH my 30 mg of Vyvanse/Elvanse in the morning. I don’t eat food and I don’t drink fluids usually before noon, so the medication and the coffee is on an empty stomach. I gotta admit, typing this I feel a little ridiculous complaining about anxiety since this is sounds probably like a “how to feel anxious in the morning” manual LOL. I don’t feel particularly anxious when the caffeine is in my system (though this happens, too), but I experience really nasty crashes. This happens especially when I overindulged some days ago. So, very oddly, my anxiety seems to be some sort of delayed ‘caffeine’ hangover. 

Any thoughts on this? Does anybody have a similar experience?
