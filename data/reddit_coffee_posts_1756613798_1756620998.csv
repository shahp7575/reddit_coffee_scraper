by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tampa Bay Rays vs. Washington Nationals: A Tale of Two Teams (One With a Six-Game Nap)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a matchup that’s less “World Series preview” and more “why is the Nationals’ lineup still wearing pajamas?” The Tampa Bay Rays (65-69) roll into Nationals Park as decided favorites (-1.5) against a Washington team that’s lost six straight and seems to have forgotten how to score runs. Let’s break this down with the precision of a umpire who’s never missed a call—and the humor of a guy who once bet on a game based on the team’s logo.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Rays Shine, Nationals Fizzle

The Rays enter this clash with a 58.5% win rate when favored, which isn’t just a stat—it’s a *threat*. Their pitching staff boasts the fourth-lowest WHIP (1.216) in MLB, meaning their defense isn’t just good; it’s the reason the opposition’s offense is currently writing resignation letters. Starter Ian Seymour, with a 3.18 ERA and a 2-0 record in 13 appearances, is the equivalent of a leaky faucet in a hurricane: not perfect, but better than the alternative.

Meanwhile, the Nationals are the MLB’s version of a group project that forgot to meet. Their 5.38 ERA is worse than a college student’s GPA, and their .387 team slugging percentage is about as threatening as a wet noodle in a sword fight. Starter Brad Lord (3.84 ERA) isn’t exactly a savior, but he’s the guy who’ll be on the mound when the Rays’ offense decides to take a coffee break.

**Implied probabilities**? The Rays’ -130 line suggests a 56% chance to win, while the Nationals’ +125 line implies bookmakers think Washington has a 33% shot. To put that in perspective, the Nationals’ odds are about the same as me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded and reciting the periodic table.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Slumps, and a Team That’s Just… Tired

Let’s start with the Nationals. Their six-game losing streak isn’t just a slump—it’s a full-blown hibernation. Star power? James Wood (26 HRs, 83 RBI) is their lone bright spot, but even he can’t outshine a team that ranks 28th in home runs. C.J. Abrams (.270 average) is their best hope, but even he can’t turn Nationals Park into a h

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boston Red Sox vs. Pittsburgh Pirates: A Tale of Two Batting Averages (and Why the Red Sox Should Win)**

The Boston Red Sox (-180) are heading into Fenway Park this Sunday like a well-oiled coffee machine: consistent, slightly caffeinated, and capable of brewing 4.9 runs per game. The Pittsburgh Pirates (+150), meanwhile, are showing up with the offensive punch of a wet noodle—3.6 runs per game, last in MLB. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a ballpark hotdog vendor who’s seen it all.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Red Sox Are the Favorite

The Red Sox’s -180 moneyline implies a 60% chance of victory, while the Pirates’ +150 suggests bookmakers see them as a 40% shot. But let’s not let numbers intimidate us. Context is key:

* **Red Sox** have won **70.6% of games** when odds are -180 or better this season. That’s the statistical equivalent of a vending machine that always dispenses snacks.
* **Pirates**, conversely, are a paltry **8-22** when the underdog is +150 or more. They’re like a slot machine that only gives you gum.

On the mound, Lucas Giolito (9-2, 3.47 ERA) is Boston’s secret weapon. The right-hander has struck out 99 batters in 119 innings this year—enough K’s to make a bartender blush. He’s just one win away from double digits, and if there’s a pitcher who needs it more, it’s a toddler in a time-out. The Pirates’ Mitch Keller (6-12, 4.35 ERA) isn’t exactly inspiring confidence. His 1.285 WHIP is like a leaky faucet: it’s not just water, it’s *runs*.

---

### Team News: Injuries, History, and Why the Pirates Should Bring a Towel

The Red Sox have no major injury concerns, but let’s spotlight their **fourth-highest scoring team in MLB**. Players like Jarren Duran (.258 BA, 13 HR) and Trevor Story (22 HR, 84 RBI) are the reason Fenway’s scoreboard looks like a fireworks show.

The Pirates? They’re the team that *invented* the term “underdog.” B

The goal is simple: bring high-quality, affordable coffee to people on the go. India’s coffee culture is booming, but most of what’s available is either overpriced café-style or low-quality vending machine coffee. There’s a gap in between, and I feel a kiosk model can bridge that — quick service, good taste, and a scalable format.

I already have some groundwork done on costs, sourcing, and margins. What I’m looking for is a co-founder who’s equally excited about the space, preferably someone with experience in F&B, retail ops, or just the grit and drive to build this out together.

(Yung nasa tabi ng sakayan ng mga PUJ.)

If I recall correctly, the library was eventually moved to the OSCA Building 2nd floor and finally, inside a small space shared with the Marikina Elementary School. 

Seeing that there is a clamor for public libraries, I think if the current LGU is really invested into restoring the public library, there are some spaces that can actually be used for ""branch libraries"". 

Three places seem viable, in my opinion. (Pwede naman i-share kung tingin ninyo mahirap ito gawin).

**1. Marikina Hotel & Convention Center Complex (Brgy. Concepcion Dos)**

https://preview.redd.it/qivhf9lcpamf1.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=e29063652cd8ce78964479da6ca1b430c6df3766

The hotel doesn't seem to be earning money anyway. Bonus na rin na LGU-controlled siya. Yes, a portion of that parking space can be repurposed into a small branch library. 

Maybe a three story building (first floor remains as a parking lot), 2nd floor will be a small coffee shop and the third floor be the mini-library.

Maingay? Well, libraries are supposed to be *quiet* places anyway, so hotel guests will not be disturbed (ideally).

**2. PLMAR (Brgy. Concepcion Dos)**

This is no-brainer. However, I think it is located a bit too close to proposal #1, so only one will do I guess.

  
**3. Marikina City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office building (Brgy. Fortune)**

https://preview.redd.it/mzszmm2bqamf1.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d67e10de0cb2d20cc6b8b5e8ecbfb9d34143ddb

A small building (90-100 sq meters) could suffice. Vertical design could be employed to maximize the space (maybe architects who have plenty of time can imagine). A small parking lot for cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, can be placed on the first floor. Coffee/snack shop on the 2nd floor para may income ang LGU.

  
Ayun lang, slow Sunday thought in the rain... All of the places (except #1) are flood-resistant places naman.

Kung gusto talaga ng LGU, kaya naman, siyempre pondo ang usapan.

1n4n7fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1n4n7fa/you_are_welcome_here/,You are welcome here.,"Hi everyone, 

In light of the current anti-immigration and counter-protest, I wanted to reiterate to the many, many immigrants, especially students and young people, that you are welcome here in Australia. This country, for all its flaws and issues, has benefitted enormously from immigration. Immigrants have driven the education, sporting, and food culture of Melbourne - a culture that all of us, even the anti-immigrant protestors benefit from daily. And as such, I wanted to say it out loud: we are richer for the diversity of thought and beliefs we have here in this country. 

Thing is, I am also an immigrant. I came from New Zealand to Melbourne 15 years ago, and as such, I ‘pass’ as ‘Australian’ in the eyes of people who are part of these anti-immigration protests. My wife and children, however, do not. She is Malaysian Chinese, and as such, we find ourselves not in the CBD today, though we often are on weekends. It’s absolutely not ok that we restrict ourselves for safety reasons today. This city’s public spaces belong to all of us, regardless of background. 

It’s short-sighted for these protestors to be out today associating with Neo-Nazis and their ilk. But when people are uncertain and afraid, they are more susceptible to the kinds of misinformation that drives cookers and their ilk (firmly looking at you, Sky News after dark). I want to be understanding, and that’s a challenge when these protests are no ill-informed and racially charged. 

‘Aussie’ is not a term for white. It’s a term for anyone who comes here and decides they want to be part of the many amazing things this country has to offer, as well as being willing to put their shoulder to the wheel to deal with the challenges we face.

If that’s you, you’re an Aussie. As Aussie as the Afghanis who bought camels here to tame the outback. As Aussie as the Italians who bought coffee culture and ran the fruit and veg stalls at Queen Vic Market. And as Aussie as the Kiwis who’ve settled here, the Vietnamese who came here in the 70’s, and the Koreans, Indians, and Chinese who’ve settled here after studying these past two decades. You are Aussie, and you are welcome. 

Whenever they cheer ‘Aussie, Aussie, Aussie’, I’ll be thinking of those categories. Because you and I belong here. We are all Australian.

## Understanding the Quiet Observer 🤐

Every family, workplace, and team has that one person who keeps their cards close to their chest. You know the type - they listen more than they speak, observe more than they participate, and seem to have an invisible barrier around their personal thoughts and feelings. These individuals aren't necessarily problematic; they're simply wired differently, preferring privacy over openness.

Working with such personalities can feel like solving a puzzle without all the pieces. However, understanding their behavioral patterns and adapting your approach can transform challenging interactions into productive relationships that benefit everyone involved.

## The Psychology Behind Reserved Behavior 🧠

Reserved individuals often operate from a place of caution rather than mistrust. They may have learned through experience that sharing too much, too quickly can lead to complications. This defensive mechanism serves them well in many situations but can create barriers in collaborative environments.

These personalities typically excel at:
- Strategic thinking and planning
- Careful risk assessment
- Independent problem-solving
- Maintaining professional boundaries
- Protecting sensitive information

Understanding these strengths helps us appreciate their value while addressing the communication challenges they might present.

## Building Bridges: The Foundation Approach 🌉

### Start with Respect for Boundaries

The most crucial element in dealing with private personalities is respecting their natural inclination toward discretion. Pushing too hard or too fast for information often results in them retreating further into their shell. Instead, demonstrate that you understand and respect their need for privacy.

Create an environment where they feel safe to share when they're ready. This means avoiding gossip, maintaining confidentiality when they do share, and never using their private information against them in any context.

### Establish Clear Communication Channels

Private individuals often prefer structured communication over casual, impromptu conversations. They appreciate knowing what to expect and having time to prepare their thoughts before important discussions.

Consider implementing:
- Scheduled check-ins rather than surprise meetings
- Written agendas for discussions
- Clear expectations about what information needs to be shared
- Multiple communication options (email, messaging, face-to-face)

## Daily Interaction Strategies That Actually Work ✨

### The Patient Observer Method

Instead of trying to extract information directly, become an observer yourself. Pay attention to their work patterns, stress indicators, and moments when they seem more open to conversation. This approach allows you to time your interactions when they're most receptive.

Watch for:
- Natural conversation opportunities during breaks or transitions
- Projects or topics that genuinely interest them
- Times when they seek out interaction rather than avoiding it
- Non-verbal cues that indicate their comfort level

### The Professional Catalyst Technique

Frame interactions around work objectives or shared goals rather than personal curiosity. Private individuals often respond better when they understand the practical purpose behind information requests.

Instead of asking ""How are you feeling about the project?"" try ""What specific resources do you need to move forward with your part of the project?"" This approach gets you the information you need while respecting their preference for task-focused communication.

### The Gradual Trust Building Process

Trust with reserved personalities isn't built through grand gestures or intense bonding sessions. It's constructed through consistent, reliable interactions over time. Show up when you say you will, follow through on commitments, and demonstrate reliability in small, everyday matters.

This might involve:
- Consistently respecting their workspace and time
- Keeping confidences they've shared, no matter how small
- Being predictable in your own behavior and expectations
- Acknowledging their contributions publicly when appropriate

## Managing Expectations and Setting Boundaries 📋

### Define What Information Is Essential

Not all information needs to be shared equally among team members. Clearly distinguish between:
- Information necessary for task completion
- Nice-to-know background details
- Personal sharing that builds relationships but isn't required

Focus your efforts on ensuring essential information flows freely while giving them space around non-critical details.

### Create Safe Spaces for Expression

Private personalities often have valuable insights but may not share them in traditional brainstorming or group discussion formats. Create alternative channels for input:

- Anonymous suggestion systems
- One-on-one consultation opportunities
- Written feedback options
- Small group discussions rather than large team meetings

## The Long-Term Relationship Strategy 🎯

### Consistency Over Intensity

Building relationships with private personalities is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistent, respectful interactions over months and years yield better results than intense relationship-building efforts over shorter periods.

Focus on:
- Regular, brief check-ins rather than occasional long conversations
- Reliable support during challenging times
- Consistent communication style and expectations
- Patient relationship building without pressure for immediate results

### Value Their Unique Contributions

Private individuals often bring unique perspectives precisely because they observe more than they participate in day-to-day drama and politics. They may have insights about team dynamics, process inefficiencies, or strategic opportunities that others miss.

Actively seek their input on:
- Process improvements and efficiency measures
- Objective assessments of team performance
- Strategic planning and risk assessment
- Quality control and attention to detail

## Practical Application in Different Contexts 🏠

### Family Settings

In family contexts, private personalities might be dealing with:
- Different communication styles among family members
- Feeling overwhelmed by family dynamics
- Need for personal space and downtime
- Preference for one-on-one conversations over group discussions

Strategies include creating individual connection time, respecting their need for space, and avoiding putting them on the spot during family gatherings.

### Professional Environments

In workplace settings, focus on:
- Clear role definitions and expectations
- Professional development opportunities that match their strengths
- Recognition for their behind-the-scenes contributions
- Structured team integration rather than forced social activities

### Team Collaborations

For team projects, consider:
- Assigning roles that leverage their observational and analytical skills
- Providing multiple ways to contribute ideas and feedback
- Creating smaller working groups rather than large team meetings
- Establishing clear communication protocols and timelines

## Avoiding Common Mistakes 🚫

### Don't Take It Personally

Reserved behavior isn't typically about you or your relationship with them. It's usually about their personal communication style and comfort zones. Interpreting their privacy as rejection or dislike often leads to counterproductive responses.

### Avoid Public Pressure

Never put private personalities on the spot in group settings or try to force them to share more than they're comfortable with. This approach almost always backfires and can damage trust permanently.

### Don't Assume Negative Intent

Private behavior doesn't indicate dishonesty, disloyalty, or lack of engagement. Many reserved individuals are highly committed and trustworthy; they simply express it differently than more open personalities.

## Measuring Success in These Relationships 📊

Success with private personalities looks different than with more open individuals. Progress indicators might include:

- Increased voluntary communication over time
- Greater participation in team activities
- More frequent initiation of conversations
- Willingness to share opinions and ideas
- Reduced defensive behaviors
- Improved collaboration on projects

## The Universal Application Framework 🌍

These strategies work across cultures, generations, and contexts because they're based on fundamental human needs for respect, predictability, and safety. Whether you're dealing with a reserved teenager, a private colleague, or a secretive family member, the core principles remain consistent:

1. Respect boundaries while maintaining connection
2. Provide structure and predictability
3. Build trust through consistency
4. Value their unique contributions
5. Create safe spaces for expression

## Looking Forward: Timeless Principles for Future Generations 🚀

The human need for privacy and the challenges of working with reserved personalities will likely remain constant regardless of technological advances or social changes. These strategies focus on fundamental human psychology and communication principles that transcend specific cultural moments or technological tools.

Future applications might involve new communication platforms or work arrangements, but the core needs for respect, trust, and understanding will remain unchanged. Teaching these skills to future generations ensures better collaboration and understanding across all personality types.

## Conclusion: Embracing Diversity in Communication Styles 🎊

Working effectively with private personalities isn't about changing them or breaking down their barriers. It's about adapting our approach to create an environment where everyone can contribute their best work while feeling comfortable and respected.

These individuals often bring valuable qualities to teams and families: careful thinking, objective analysis, reliable performance, and strategic insights. By learning to work with their communication style rather than against it, we create more inclusive and effective environments for everyone.

The investment in understanding and adapting to different personality types pays dividends in improved relationships, better team performance, and more harmonious family dynamics. Most importantly, it demonstrates respect for the full spectrum of human communication preferences and helps create environments where everyone can thrive.

Remember, the goal isn't to turn private personalities into open books. It's to build bridges that allow for effective collaboration while honoring everyone's natural communication style. This approach benefits not just the reserved individuals in your life, but creates a more understanding and flexible environment for everyone involved.

## Understanding the Communication Challenge 🗣️

We all know them. They're in our families, our workplaces, our friend circles, and social groups. These are the people who seem to have an endless reservoir of stories, updates, opinions, and personal details they feel compelled to share. While their intentions are often good, their communication style can overwhelm others and create uncomfortable social dynamics.

The over-sharing behavior isn't necessarily malicious or attention-seeking. Often, it stems from genuine enthusiasm, anxiety, loneliness, or simply different communication preferences. Understanding this foundation helps us approach the situation with empathy while protecting our own mental energy.

## Recognizing the Patterns 🔍

Over-sharers typically exhibit predictable behaviors that you can learn to identify:

They dominate conversations by turning every topic back to their own experiences. When you mention a movie you enjoyed, they launch into a lengthy story about their entire weekend. They share intimate details about their relationships, health issues, or financial situations in casual settings where such information feels inappropriate.

These individuals often struggle with social boundaries and may not pick up on nonverbal cues that others want to change the subject or end the conversation. They might interrupt frequently, not because they're rude, but because they're excited to share their thoughts.

They frequently use phrases like ""That reminds me of the time when..."" or ""Speaking of which..."" as bridges to launch into their next story. They may also send lengthy text messages, emails, or voice notes that require significant time to process.

## The Impact on Relationships 💭

Over-sharing creates a ripple effect that extends beyond simple annoyance. Team productivity suffers when meetings regularly run overtime due to lengthy personal anecdotes. Family gatherings become exhausting when one person monopolizes every conversation.

In workplace settings, over-sharing can damage professional relationships and create uncomfortable environments. Colleagues may start avoiding the over-sharer, leading to isolation and reduced collaboration. The person may remain unaware of how their behavior affects others, creating a cycle of increased sharing as they try to connect.

Personal relationships also suffer when communication becomes one-sided. Friends and family members may feel like unpaid therapists or captive audiences rather than equal participants in meaningful exchanges.

## Practical Response Strategies 🛠️

**The Redirect Technique**
When someone begins over-sharing, gently redirect the conversation back to the original topic or to include others. Use phrases like ""That's interesting, but I'm curious about what others think about..."" or ""Let's get back to discussing the project timeline.""

**Time Boundaries**
Set clear time limits for conversations. Say something like ""I have about five minutes to chat before my next meeting"" or ""I can listen for a few minutes, then I need to get back to my tasks."" This creates a natural endpoint without being dismissive.

**The Acknowledge and Pivot Method**
Briefly acknowledge what they've shared, then smoothly transition to a different topic or include others. ""Thanks for sharing that. Now, regarding the budget proposal..."" or ""I hear you. Sarah, what's your take on this situation?""

**Physical Positioning**
Use body language to signal conversation boundaries. Stand rather than sit during impromptu conversations, position yourself near an exit, or use busy work as a natural conversation ender.

## Professional Environment Solutions 💼

In workplace settings, structure becomes your ally. Implement meeting agendas with time limits for each topic. When someone goes off-topic, politely reference the agenda: ""That's valuable input. Can we table that for after the meeting so we can cover today's priorities?""

Create designated spaces for social conversation, like coffee breaks or lunch periods, while keeping work meetings focused on business objectives. This gives over-sharers appropriate outlets for their communication needs without disrupting productivity.

For managers dealing with over-sharing team members, private one-on-one conversations can address the behavior directly. Focus on the impact rather than the person: ""I've noticed our team meetings are running long because of extended discussions. Let's work on keeping contributions concise so everyone gets heard.""

## Family Dynamics Approach 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Family situations require extra sensitivity since these relationships are ongoing and emotionally complex. The key is consistency and kindness. Establish family communication norms during calm moments, not in the heat of frustration.

Use natural conversation breaks to include others: ""That's quite a story, Uncle Bob. Mom, how was your week?"" or ""Thanks for the update. Kids, tell us about your school projects."" This redistributes speaking time without directly criticizing anyone.

For family gatherings, consider structured activities that naturally limit individual speaking time. Board games, collaborative cooking, or outdoor activities create shared experiences rather than one-person monologues.

## The Compassionate Boundary Setting 💝

Remember that over-sharers are often seeking connection, validation, or emotional support. Your response doesn't need to be cold or dismissive. Instead, offer focused attention for brief periods: ""I can see this is important to you. I have a few minutes to listen right now.""

When you need to end a conversation, provide a specific reason and, when possible, an alternative: ""I need to focus on this report now. Would you like to continue this conversation during lunch?"" This shows respect for their need to communicate while protecting your time.

Practice the ""broken record"" technique when necessary. Repeat your boundary calmly and consistently: ""I understand this is important to you, and I need to get back to my work now."" Don't feel obligated to provide new excuses or justifications each time.

## Building Mutual Understanding 🤝

Sometimes, a direct conversation about communication styles can be helpful, especially with close family members or long-term colleagues. Approach this sensitively, focusing on finding balance rather than criticizing their personality.

Frame the discussion around everyone's needs: ""I value our conversations, and I've noticed I sometimes struggle to contribute when discussions go on for a long time. Could we try taking turns sharing updates?"" This creates a collaborative solution rather than a confrontational dynamic.

Help over-sharers develop self-awareness by asking questions that encourage reflection: ""How do you think the team felt about that meeting?"" or ""What do you think worked well in our conversation today?"" This builds their ability to read social situations more effectively.

## Technology and Communication 📱

In our digital age, over-sharing extends beyond face-to-face interactions. Set boundaries around response times for lengthy messages. You don't need to immediately respond to every detailed text or email.

Use technology to your advantage by suggesting email summaries for complex topics instead of lengthy verbal explanations: ""This sounds important. Could you send me the key points in an email so I can review them properly?""

For persistent digital over-sharers, consider using features like message scheduling or delayed responses to avoid encouraging immediate, lengthy replies.

## Long-term Relationship Management 📈

Sustainable relationships with over-sharers require ongoing boundary maintenance and positive reinforcement of good communication behaviors. When they respect time limits or include others in conversation, acknowledge this: ""I really appreciated how you made sure everyone could contribute during today's discussion.""

Recognize that changing ingrained communication patterns takes time. Be patient with gradual improvements rather than expecting immediate transformation. Consistency in your responses helps them learn what works best for mutual respect and understanding.

Consider that some people may never fully change their communication style, and that's okay. Your goal isn't to transform them but to manage the interaction in a way that works for everyone involved.

## Creating Positive Communication Culture 🌟

Whether in families or workplaces, establishing clear communication norms benefits everyone, not just over-sharers. Regular check-ins, structured sharing time, and inclusive conversation practices create environments where all personality types can thrive.

Model good communication behaviors yourself. Ask questions, listen actively, and share speaking time equitably. This creates positive examples for others to follow naturally.

Celebrate diverse communication styles while maintaining practical boundaries. Some people process thoughts out loud, others prefer written communication, and some need time to formulate responses. Creating space for different approaches while maintaining structure benefits the entire group.

## The Bigger Picture Perspective 🎯

Dealing with over-sharers is ultimately about creating balanced relationships where everyone feels heard and respected. It's not about silencing enthusiastic communicators but about finding sustainable ways to interact that work for all parties involved.

These skills transfer to many other relationship challenges. Learning to set kind but firm boundaries, redirect conversations diplomatically, and maintain empathy while protecting your energy serves you well in numerous life situations.

Remember that your mental and emotional energy are valuable resources that deserve protection. Taking care of your own communication needs isn't selfish—it's necessary for maintaining healthy, long-term relationships with all the important people in your life.

The ability to navigate challenging communication dynamics with grace and effectiveness is a skill that will serve you throughout your entire life, regardless of how society or technology changes. Human nature remains consistent, and these fundamental relationship management principles remain relevant across generations and cultures.

1n4n1sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/navimumbai/comments/1n4n1sz/stay_away_from_toxic_meeetup_groups/,Stay away from toxic meeetup groups,"I’ve been part of several meetup groups across Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi. Thanks to platforms like Discord and Reddit, these groups have grown since it’s not always easy to meet like-minded people as an adult. My 2 cents— find your vibe, avoid toxic groups, and don’t waste time on admins who thrive on negativity— many admins are just insecure guys looking for validation. Women especially need to watch out for creeps.

Last year, I joined a Navi Mumbai meetup group run by an NRI and his girlfriend. The group itself was fine, and I mostly engaged in conversations about gaming, sports, and concerts. I only attended one pub crawl, but between my own friends and personal life, I couldn’t make it to coffee meetups or badminton sessions.

At some point recently, the admin threw a meltdown about how running the group was a “thankless, unpaid job” and threatened to shut it down due to low attendance. People tried calming him, suggested changes, and even proposed a farewell meetup, but he kept acting superior. Out of the 60 or 100 people, hardly 5-6 people would consistently show up at meetups while others (like myself) were either too busy or not very comfortable playing fucking Ludo in some Belapur cafe (I’d rather do something else). 

The admin wasn’t building and fostering a community— he was grooming a cult-like fan club around himself. It felt like he couldn’t stand the idea of people enjoying themselves beyond his little meetup circle. Eventually, the group stayed alive, but after that he seemed to have a grudge against members like me who participated online without showing up often. Despite that, I still contributed—sharing food recommendations, offering career advice, and even volunteering to host parties. But whenever I posted something fun, like a C0ldplay concert clip or a Lonavala hike, the admin would drop extremely snide remarks which really pissed me off. It was unnecessary and toxic—clearly more about his ego than the group. 

Eventually, I’d had enough. One fine morning, he posted something and I clapped back, saying no one cares about his silly coffee meetups and trying to shut down the only online engagement they have is the reason this group is dead. A handful of people liked my comment and this chutiya admin was visibly offended and responded with another tantrum and told me to leave if I don’t like it (trying to silence dissent). I didn’t argue—I just left.  

At the end of the day, life’s too short to deal with toxic people— focus on good vibes and lasting bonds. A meetup is just a way to meet people, not a substitute for genuine friends or meaningful connections. ",6,1756619827.0,navimumbai,1,0.88,False

*A practical guide to handling entitled behavior without losing your sanity*

---

We all know this person. They exist in every family gathering, workplace, and social group. The individual who believes rules don't apply to them, who expects special treatment without earning it, and who throws a tantrum when reality doesn't bend to their wishes. Let's call them what they are: entitled people. And today, we're going to explore how to deal with them effectively. 💪

## Understanding the Entitled Mind 🧠

Before diving into solutions, it's important to understand what drives entitled behavior. These individuals often operate from a deep-seated belief that they deserve preferential treatment. This mindset usually stems from:

- **Overindulgence during childhood** 👶 - When every whim was satisfied without question
- **Fear of failure** 😰 - Using entitlement as a shield against accountability  
- **Low self-esteem masked by grandiosity** 🎭 - Compensating for inner insecurity with external demands
- **Lack of real-world consequences** 🛡️ - Never having faced genuine accountability for their actions

The key insight? Entitled behavior is learned, which means it can be unlearned through consistent, appropriate responses.

## The Universal Framework: CLEAR 🎯

After years of observation and practical application, here's a methodology that works across all contexts - family, workplace, friendships, or any team environment:

### C - Consistent Boundaries ⚡

Set clear, non-negotiable boundaries and stick to them religiously. Entitled individuals are experts at testing limits. They'll push, prod, and manipulate to see where your resolve weakens. Your consistency becomes their teacher.

**In practice:**
- If you say ""no"" to a request, mean it completely
- Don't negotiate once you've made a decision based on fair principles
- Apply the same rules every single time, regardless of their emotional reactions

### L - Logical Consequences 📊

Let natural outcomes teach the lessons you can't. When someone acts entitled, don't rescue them from the results of their choices. This is perhaps the most powerful tool in your arsenal.

**Real-world examples:**
- Colleague misses deadlines? Let them explain to the boss directly
- Family member doesn't help with chores? They can manage without the benefits others earn through contribution
- Friend always cancels last minute? Stop making plans that depend on their reliability

### E - Emotional Detachment 🧘

This doesn't mean becoming cold or uncaring. It means not allowing their emotional manipulation to dictate your responses. Entitled people are often masters of emotional theater - tears, anger, guilt-trips, and dramatic proclamations.

**Your emotional toolkit:**
- Breathe deeply before responding to their outbursts
- Stick to facts rather than engaging with emotions
- Remember: their feelings about consequences don't change the appropriateness of those consequences

### A - Alternative Options 🎨

Always provide choices, but make sure all options require effort or accountability from them. This prevents them from claiming you're being ""unfair"" while still maintaining your boundaries.

**Choice frameworks:**
- ""You can do X and get Y, or do Z and get W""
- Never offer options that reward entitled behavior
- Make sure each choice has clear expectations attached

### R - Respectful Firmness 💎

Maintain your dignity and theirs while holding the line. You can be kind without being a pushover. Respect doesn't mean agreement, and firmness doesn't require cruelty.

**Communication style:**
- Use calm, steady voice tones
- Acknowledge their feelings without changing your position
- Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not character attacks

## Family Dynamics: The Delicate Balance ⚖️

Families present unique challenges because you can't simply walk away. The entitled family member often has years of established patterns and enablers who make change difficult.

**Strategy for family settings:**

**United Front Approach:** Work with other family members to establish consistent responses. When Uncle Bob always expects others to pay his restaurant bills, everyone needs to agree on the same boundary.

**Holiday and Event Planning:** Don't let entitled behavior ruin gatherings for everyone else. Plan events assuming they might create drama, and have backup plans ready.

**Financial Boundaries:** Money is often the battleground with entitled family members. Never lend what you can't afford to lose, and don't enable financial irresponsibility.

**Communication Patterns:** Establish family meetings or discussions where everyone's contributions and expectations are clearly outlined. Make entitlement harder by making expectations transparent.

## Workplace Tactics: Professional Yet Effective 💼

The professional environment requires finesse, but the same principles apply with slight modifications.

**Documentation is Key:** Keep records of entitled behavior and your responses. This protects you and provides evidence if situations escalate.

**Collaborative Solutions:** Frame boundary-setting as team efficiency rather than personal conflict. ""To help our project succeed, we need everyone to meet their deadlines.""

**Manager Involvement:** Don't try to handle everything alone. When entitled behavior affects team performance, involve leadership appropriately.

**Professional Language:** Use business-focused terminology. Instead of ""you're being unreasonable,"" try ""let's explore solutions that work for the entire team.""

## The Social Circle Strategy 👥

Friends and social groups offer the most flexibility in dealing with entitled individuals, but also present emotional complexities.

**Gradual Boundary Implementation:** Start small and build up. Don't suddenly change everything at once, as this can create unnecessary drama.

**Group Consensus:** Work with mutual friends to establish consistent approaches. Entitled individuals often try to play people against each other.

**Activity Planning:** Choose activities and events that naturally discourage entitled behavior. Group settings where everyone contributes equally work best.

**Exit Strategy:** Unlike family or work, you can choose to end friendships that become too toxic. Don't be afraid to use this option when necessary.

## Daily Implementation: Making It Real 🌟

Theory means nothing without practical application. Here's how to integrate these principles into your everyday interactions:

**Morning Mindset:** Start each day reminding yourself that you're not responsible for managing other people's emotions or consequences.

**Response Preparation:** Think through common scenarios before they happen. Having pre-planned responses reduces the chance you'll cave under pressure.

**Support Network:** Identify people who understand and support your boundary-setting efforts. You'll need encouragement when entitled individuals push back.

**Self-Care Practices:** Dealing with entitled behavior is emotionally draining. Maintain activities and relationships that recharge your energy.

**Progress Tracking:** Notice small changes over time. Entitled individuals rarely transform overnight, but consistent application of boundaries often leads to gradual improvements.

## Advanced Techniques: When Basic Approaches Fail 🚀

Sometimes, standard boundary-setting isn't enough. These advanced strategies can help in persistent situations:

**Natural Consequence Amplification:** Instead of preventing negative outcomes, help them happen faster. This accelerates the learning process.

**Expectation Documentation:** Write down agreements and expectations. This prevents the ""I never said that"" problem common with entitled individuals.

**Third-Party Mediation:** Bring in neutral parties when direct communication breaks down. Sometimes outside perspectives break through entitled thinking.

**Graduated Response System:** Create escalating consequences for repeated entitled behavior. Start small but increase impact with each violation.

**Environmental Changes:** Modify situations to make entitled behavior more difficult or less rewarding. Change the game instead of just changing the rules.

## Long-Term Relationship Management 🌱

Successfully dealing with entitled individuals requires thinking beyond immediate conflicts to long-term relationship dynamics.

**Sustainable Boundaries:** Create boundaries you can maintain indefinitely. Don't set limits you'll abandon when you get tired or busy.

**Relationship Redefinition:** Accept that your relationship with this person might need to change. Some entitled individuals will choose to distance themselves rather than accept boundaries.

**Success Metrics:** Define what improvement looks like. Maybe they won't become completely reasonable, but any reduction in entitled behavior is progress.

**Flexibility Within Structure:** Maintain core boundaries while allowing for genuine emergencies or special circumstances. The key is ensuring these exceptions remain truly exceptional.

**Personal Growth Focus:** Use these experiences to become better at recognizing and responding to manipulation in all areas of life.

## The Ripple Effect: Benefits Beyond the Individual 🌊

Properly handling entitled behavior doesn't just improve your relationship with that one difficult person. The skills and confidence you develop create positive changes throughout your life:

**Enhanced Leadership Abilities:** Learning to set boundaries with entitled individuals makes you more effective in leadership roles across all contexts.

**Improved Self-Respect:** Standing up to unreasonable demands builds confidence and self-worth that influences every interaction.

**Better Relationship Quality:** People respect those who maintain appropriate boundaries, leading to healthier relationships overall.

**Stress Reduction:** Eliminating the constant anxiety of dealing with entitled behavior significantly improves mental health and life satisfaction.

**Model for Others:** Your consistent boundary-setting gives others permission to do the same, creating positive change in entire family or work systems.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes 🚫

Even with the best intentions, people often make errors when dealing with entitled individuals. Avoid these pitfalls:

**The Explanation Trap:** Don't over-explain your boundaries. Entitled people will use your explanations as negotiation starting points.

**Consistency Lapses:** Giving in ""just this once"" often resets all your progress and teaches them that persistence pays off.

**Emotional Engagement:** Getting drawn into arguments about fairness or reasonableness rarely leads to positive outcomes.

**Isolation Attempts:** Don't try to handle everything alone. Build support networks and use available resources.

**Perfectionism:** Accept that entitled individuals might never become completely reasonable. Focus on reducing problematic behavior rather than achieving perfection.

## Cultural and Generational Considerations 🌍

Entitled behavior manifests differently across cultures and generations. Adapt your approach while maintaining core principles:

**Respect Cultural Norms:** Understand family or workplace hierarchies while still maintaining appropriate boundaries.

**Generational Patterns:** Recognize that entitled behavior often passes through families. Breaking these cycles requires patience and persistence.

**Communication Styles:** Adapt your boundary-setting language to match cultural expectations while maintaining firmness.

**Value Systems:** Frame boundaries in terms of shared values when possible, making them harder to dismiss as arbitrary.

## The Technology Factor 📱

Modern technology creates new challenges in managing entitled behavior:

**Digital Boundaries:** Set clear expectations about response times to messages and availability for non-urgent communication.

**Social Media Management:** Don't let entitled individuals use public platforms to pressure or manipulate you.

**Documentation Tools:** Use technology to track patterns and maintain records of entitled behavior and your responses.

**Communication Channels:** Choose appropriate platforms for different types of conversations, maintaining professional boundaries.

## Conclusion: Your New Superpower 🦸

Dealing with entitled individuals effectively is a learnable skill that improves with practice. By implementing the CLEAR methodology consistently across all contexts, you'll find that these challenging relationships become more manageable and less stressful.

Remember that change takes time, both for them and for you. Be patient with the process while remaining firm in your boundaries. The goal isn't to transform entitled individuals into perfect people, but to create relationships where mutual respect and reasonable expectations prevail.

I walked into the kitchen at around midnight. I saw the moka pot sitting next to sink. I proceed to begin the cleaning process so I can brew a cup in the morning.

I unscrew the pot. I see that the grounds have barely been used. They did not look too different from a fresh grind. Just a little moist. All seems ok to grind. I think to myself, why not try to brew with exactly what is left in the pot?

I thus fill up the pot with water and turn on the gas stove.

The flow is terrible, the color is bright piss, and the aroma brings this image: you're a deadbeat dad in Boston; you live in the worst side of the affluent suburbs (Everett).

Your wife just finished her morning coke and is ready to yell at you for being slow with the coffee brew.

But you make that goddamn pot of coffee like it's your last cuz you know you're finished.

I kid. I kid. 

The resulting brew is brilliant. The taste is like a 1908s movie diner coffee. The brew brings out a unique acidity, tangy yet flavorful. It's like drinking your own urine, but without all that bacteria. Delicious and enjoyable!

It's draining beyond comprehension. It can result in self neglect by trying to be empathetic by giving them time and focused attention.

1n4my4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n4my4j/the_art_of_connecting_with_reserved_team_members/,The Art of Connecting with Reserved Team Members: A Practical Guide,"

Every workplace, family, and social circle has them – those quiet individuals who seem to keep their thoughts close to their chest. They're the ones who nod politely during meetings, offer brief responses when asked direct questions, and rarely volunteer information about their feelings or opinions. Understanding and effectively working with these reserved personalities isn't just about being nice – it's about unlocking potential, building stronger teams, and creating environments where everyone can contribute meaningfully.

## Understanding the Reserved Mindset 🧠

Reserved individuals aren't necessarily shy or antisocial. Often, they're deep thinkers who prefer to process information thoroughly before sharing their thoughts. They might come from backgrounds where speaking up wasn't encouraged, or they simply have different communication styles than their more vocal counterparts.

These team members frequently possess valuable insights that remain untapped because the environment doesn't naturally draw them out. They observe, analyze, and form well-considered opinions – but they need the right conditions to share them.

## Creating the Right Environment 🌱

The foundation of connecting with reserved individuals lies in creating psychological safety. This means establishing an atmosphere where people feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment, ridicule, or negative consequences.

Start by examining your own communication patterns. Do you dominate conversations? Do you interrupt others? Do you react negatively when someone disagrees with you? Reserved individuals are often keen observers who will only open up when they feel genuinely safe to do so.

## The Power of One-on-One Interactions 👥

Group settings can be overwhelming for reserved personalities. The key is to create opportunities for individual conversations. This doesn't mean formal, intimidating meetings – instead, think casual coffee chats, brief check-ins, or collaborative work sessions.

During these interactions, focus on asking open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple yes or no. Instead of ""Did you like the presentation?"" try ""What aspects of the presentation resonated most with you?"" This approach invites deeper thinking and more comprehensive responses.

## Patience as a Strategic Tool ⏰

One of the biggest mistakes people make with reserved individuals is rushing them. These personalities often need time to formulate their thoughts before speaking. Learn to embrace comfortable silences rather than filling every pause with words.

When you ask a question, count to ten in your head before moving on or rephrasing. You'll be amazed at how often meaningful responses emerge during those moments of silence that others might consider awkward.

## Active Listening Without Agenda 👂

Reserved individuals can sense when someone is listening with an agenda versus genuinely wanting to understand their perspective. Practice active listening by focusing entirely on what they're saying rather than planning your response.

Reflect back what you've heard to confirm understanding: ""It sounds like you're concerned about the timeline because of the complexity involved. Is that accurate?"" This approach shows genuine interest and encourages further elaboration.

## Written Communication as a Bridge 📝

Many reserved individuals express themselves more freely in writing than in verbal communication. Utilize emails, messaging platforms, or collaborative documents to give them alternative ways to contribute their thoughts.

Consider sending questions or topics in advance of meetings, allowing them time to prepare their thoughts. This preparation time often results in more meaningful contributions from reserved team members.

## Recognizing Different Types of Intelligence 🎯

Reserved individuals often demonstrate high emotional intelligence, analytical thinking, or creative problem-solving skills that might not be immediately apparent in traditional verbal exchanges. Learn to recognize and value these different forms of contribution.

Some people process information visually, others through hands-on experience, and some through quiet reflection. Accommodate these different processing styles by offering various ways for people to engage with information and contribute to discussions.

## Building Trust Through Consistency 🤝

Trust with reserved individuals isn't built through grand gestures but through consistent, reliable behavior over time. Follow through on commitments, maintain confidentiality when appropriate, and demonstrate respect for their communication style.

Avoid putting them on the spot in group settings or forcing them to share before they're ready. This kind of pressure often causes reserved individuals to withdraw further rather than open up.

## The Gentle Art of Encouragement 🌟

Encouragement for reserved personalities looks different than it does for extroverted individuals. Instead of public praise that might make them uncomfortable, consider private acknowledgment of their contributions.

When they do share ideas or opinions, respond thoughtfully and build upon their contributions rather than simply moving on to the next person. This shows that their input is valued and encourages future participation.

## Creating Multiple Participation Channels 🚀

Not everyone contributes best through verbal discussion. Create opportunities for reserved individuals to participate through project leadership, written reports, one-on-one mentoring, or specialized expertise sharing.

Some of the most valuable team members are those who prefer to contribute through their work quality rather than their verbal presence in meetings. Recognize and celebrate these different contribution styles.

## Managing Group Dynamics ⚖️

In group settings, be mindful of dominating personalities who might inadvertently silence reserved voices. As a leader or facilitator, it's your responsibility to ensure balanced participation.

Use techniques like round-robin discussions where everyone shares thoughts in turn, or small group breakouts that feel less intimidating than large group discussions. These structures create natural opportunities for quieter voices to emerge.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls ⚠️

Don't mistake reserved behavior for disengagement or lack of interest. Many quiet individuals are highly engaged – they simply process and express their engagement differently.

Avoid labeling reserved individuals as ""problems to fix"" or trying to force them to become more extroverted. Instead, focus on creating conditions where their natural communication style can flourish.

## The Long-Term Relationship Investment 📈

Building meaningful connections with reserved individuals requires patience and consistent effort over time. These relationships often develop slowly but tend to be deep and loyal once established.

Remember that trust is earned through small, consistent actions rather than dramatic gestures. Show genuine interest in their perspectives, respect their boundaries, and create safe spaces for gradual opening up.

## Practical Daily Applications 💼

In meetings, try techniques like ""think-pair-share"" where people first reflect individually, then discuss with a partner before sharing with the larger group. This structure gives reserved individuals processing time and a lower-pressure environment to test their ideas.

When assigning projects, consider pairing reserved individuals with patient, encouraging teammates rather than highly assertive personalities who might overshadow their contributions.

For family situations, create regular one-on-one time with reserved family members. This might be cooking together, taking walks, or engaging in shared hobbies where conversation flows naturally alongside activity.

## Measuring Success Differently 📊

Success in connecting with reserved individuals might not look like dramatic personality changes or sudden chattiness. Instead, look for subtle indicators: more frequent eye contact, slightly longer responses to questions, voluntary sharing of small personal details, or increased participation in group activities.

These incremental changes often represent significant trust-building progress that should be acknowledged and nurtured.

## Technology as a Communication Tool 💻

Modern technology offers numerous ways for reserved individuals to contribute meaningfully. Collaborative platforms, anonymous suggestion boxes, and digital brainstorming tools can provide comfortable participation avenues.

Video calls with chat functions allow reserved participants to contribute through text while others speak verbally, creating multiple simultaneous communication channels that accommodate different comfort levels.

## Cultural Considerations 🌍

Remember that communication styles vary significantly across cultures. What might appear to be a reserved personality could be cultural norm adherence or language processing differences for non-native speakers.

Approach these situations with curiosity rather than assumptions, and create multiple ways for people to demonstrate their knowledge and capabilities beyond verbal communication in group settings.

## The Ripple Effect of Inclusion 🌊

When you successfully create environments where reserved individuals can contribute meaningfully, the benefits extend far beyond those specific people. Teams become more thoughtful, decisions improve through diverse input, and overall group dynamics become more inclusive and productive.

Reserved individuals often become some of the most valuable team members once they feel comfortable contributing, bringing careful analysis, creative solutions, and steady reliability to group efforts.

## Moving Forward with Purpose 🎯

The goal isn't to change reserved individuals but to create environments where their natural strengths can emerge and contribute to collective success. This requires ongoing attention, patience, and commitment to inclusive communication practices.

Start small with one or two specific techniques, practice them consistently, and gradually expand your approach based on what works best with the particular individuals in your life.

Remember that building these connections is an investment in long-term relationship quality and team effectiveness. The quiet voices often carry the most thoughtful insights – your job is simply to create the conditions where those insights can safely emerge and be heard.

*The journey of understanding and connecting with reserved personalities is ongoing and deeply rewarding. Every small step toward inclusivity creates stronger, more productive relationships that benefit everyone involved.*

1n4mwoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n4mwoc/breaking_the_sorry_cycle_a_practical_guide_to/,Breaking the Sorry Cycle: A Practical Guide to Helping Chronic Apologizers,"
🔄 We all know someone who says ""sorry"" for everything - from asking a question to existing in a space. These individuals apologize for things that aren't their fault, situations beyond their control, and even for apologizing too much. This pattern affects productivity, relationships, and personal growth in ways that ripple through families, workplaces, and social circles.

**Understanding the Pattern 🧠**

The chronic apologizer operates from a place of assumed responsibility for everyone's comfort and happiness. They've internalized the belief that their presence, needs, or opinions might inconvenience others. This behavior often stems from early experiences where they learned that preemptive apologies could prevent conflict or disappointment.

In practical terms, you'll notice these individuals:
- Apologizing before speaking in meetings
- Saying sorry for weather conditions or traffic delays
- Apologizing for other people's mistakes
- Using ""sorry"" as a conversation starter
- Apologizing for having emotions or needs

**The Hidden Costs 💡**

This pattern creates several challenges that affect everyone involved:

**For the Apologizer:**
- Diminished authority and credibility
- Increased anxiety about social interactions
- Reduced ability to advocate for themselves
- Lower perceived competence by others
- Chronic stress from hypervigilance about others' reactions

**For Others:**
- Difficulty taking them seriously in important situations
- Frustration with unnecessary interruptions to conversations
- Uncertainty about when genuine apologies are needed
- Uncomfortable dynamic where they feel responsible for reassurance

**Practical Intervention Strategies 🛠️**

**1. The Awareness Building Approach**

Start by creating awareness without judgment. Many chronic apologizers don't realize the frequency of their apologies.

*Daily Implementation:*
- Keep a casual count during conversations: ""You've said sorry five times in the last ten minutes. Let's see if we can cut that in half.""
- Use gentle mirrors: ""What are you actually sorry for right now?""
- Introduce the ""sorry jar"" concept where they put a coin in each time they apologize unnecessarily

*Long-term Building:*
- Help them identify their specific triggers (asking questions, having opinions, needing help)
- Practice conversations where apologies are completely banned
- Role-play scenarios where confident communication is modeled

**2. The Replacement Strategy 🔄**

Instead of just eliminating apologies, provide alternative phrases that feel more natural.

*Replace ""Sorry, but..."" with:*
- ""I have a different perspective...""
- ""Here's another way to look at it...""
- ""I'd like to add...""

*Replace ""Sorry for bothering you"" with:*
- ""Do you have a moment to discuss...""
- ""When you're available, could we...""
- ""I have a question about...""

*Replace ""Sorry I'm late"" with:*
- ""Thank you for waiting""
- ""Traffic was heavier than expected""
- Simple acknowledgment without self-blame

**3. The Boundary Reinforcement Method 🎯**

Help them understand what deserves an apology and what doesn't.

*Apology-Worthy Situations:*
- When you've actually caused harm or inconvenience
- When you've made a genuine mistake that affects others
- When you've violated someone's boundaries or agreements

*Non-Apology Situations:*
- Asking legitimate questions
- Having different opinions
- Experiencing normal human emotions
- Taking up reasonable space or time
- Other people's bad moods or reactions

**4. The Confidence Building Framework 💪**

Address the underlying beliefs that drive the behavior.

*Daily Affirmations Practice:*
- ""My thoughts and opinions have value""
- ""I deserve to take up space""
- ""Other people can handle their own emotions""
- ""I am not responsible for everyone's comfort""

*Gradual Exposure:*
- Start with low-stakes situations where they practice not apologizing
- Gradually increase to more challenging scenarios
- Celebrate successful interactions without unnecessary apologies

**Creating Supportive Environments 🌟**

**In Family Settings:**

Establish family communication guidelines that discourage unnecessary apologies. Create regular check-ins where family members can express needs without preemptive apologies. Model confident communication in your own interactions.

**In Workplace Contexts:**

Develop meeting norms that encourage direct communication. Provide specific feedback about communication effectiveness rather than focusing on the apologizing behavior. Create opportunities for the individual to practice assertive communication in safe settings.

**In Social Situations:**

Be patient with the process of change while maintaining boundaries about what deserves an apology. Redirect conversations when unnecessary apologies derail important discussions. Acknowledge and praise instances of confident communication.

**The Response Toolkit 🧰**

When someone apologizes unnecessarily, your response matters:

*Effective Responses:*
- ""No apology needed - what did you want to discuss?""
- ""You don't need to apologize for having thoughts""
- Simple acknowledgment that moves the conversation forward

*Avoid These Responses:*
- ""Stop apologizing so much"" (creates more anxiety)
- Ignoring the pattern completely
- Making jokes about their apologizing habit
- Getting frustrated or impatient with the behavior

**Measuring Progress 📈**

Track improvement through concrete observations:
- Frequency of unnecessary apologies in conversations
- Ability to ask questions without prefacing with apologies
- Confidence in expressing disagreement
- Speed of recovery when they do apologize unnecessarily
- Quality of their contributions in group settings

**Long-Term Sustainability 🌱**

Change takes time, especially for deeply ingrained communication patterns. Expect setbacks during stressful periods or when facing new social situations. The goal isn't to eliminate all apologies but to ensure they're used appropriately and effectively.

Focus on building genuine self-confidence rather than just changing surface behaviors. Address underlying beliefs about worthiness, responsibility, and social dynamics. Celebrate progress in small increments rather than expecting dramatic transformations.

**The Ripple Effects 🌊**

When someone breaks the chronic apologizing pattern, the benefits extend beyond individual improvement:

- More authentic relationships based on genuine communication
- Increased efficiency in group decision-making processes
- Better conflict resolution when apologies are used appropriately
- Enhanced trust and respect in professional relationships
- Improved emotional well-being for everyone involved

**Moving Forward 🚀**

Remember that helping someone change this pattern requires patience, consistency, and genuine care. The goal isn't to create someone who never apologizes, but to help them use apologies effectively and communicate with appropriate confidence.

This transformation benefits everyone involved by creating clearer communication, stronger relationships, and more productive interactions. Whether in family dynamics, workplace teams, or social circles, supporting someone through this change contributes to healthier communication patterns for the entire group.

The journey from chronic apologizing to confident communication is ultimately about helping someone recognize their inherent worth and right to participate fully in conversations and relationships. This recognition creates positive changes that extend far beyond individual interactions, contributing to more respectful and effective communication in all areas of life.

*Building bridges instead of walls in your daily interactions*

## Understanding the Challenge 🤔

We've all encountered them - those individuals who seem to lack the spark that drives others forward. Whether it's in your family, workplace, or any group setting, there's always someone who appears disconnected from collective goals. Instead of labeling these people negatively, let's explore practical ways to engage and motivate them effectively.

The truth is, what we perceive as ""lack of ambition"" often stems from deeper issues: unclear expectations, mismatched roles, personal struggles, or simply different communication styles. Rather than writing these individuals off, smart leaders and family members learn to unlock their potential.

---

## The Psychology Behind Low Engagement 🧠

Every person has unique drivers and blockers. Some individuals thrive on competition, while others need collaboration. Some require detailed instructions, while others prefer creative freedom. When someone appears unmotivated, it usually means their natural drives aren't being activated properly.

Think of it like a car engine that won't start. The problem isn't necessarily with the engine itself - it might need the right fuel, a spark plug replacement, or simply someone who knows how to turn the key correctly. People work similarly. They have potential energy waiting to be converted into kinetic energy through the right approach.

---

## The Foundation: Building Trust First 🤝

Before attempting any motivational strategies, establish genuine trust. This means:

**Active Listening Without Judgment** 👂
- Give them your full attention during conversations
- Ask open-ended questions about their perspectives
- Avoid immediately offering solutions or criticism
- Reflect back what you hear to show understanding

**Consistent Reliability** ⏰
- Follow through on your commitments to them
- Be available when you say you will be
- Maintain confidentiality when they share concerns
- Show up consistently, not just when you need something

**Genuine Interest in Their Success** 🌟
- Celebrate their small wins publicly
- Remember details about their goals and challenges
- Offer support without strings attached
- Invest time in understanding their preferred working style

---

## Practical Daily Strategies That Work 💪

### Morning Momentum Builders

Start each day by setting clear, achievable expectations. Instead of overwhelming them with long-term goals, break everything down into daily victories. This might mean:

- ""Today, let's focus on completing these three specific tasks""
- ""What's one thing you'd like to accomplish before lunch?""
- ""Here's how today's work connects to the bigger picture""

### The Power of Choice Architecture 🎯

People engage more when they feel they have control. Offer structured choices rather than open-ended assignments:

- ""Would you prefer to tackle the creative aspects or the analytical parts first?""
- ""Should we schedule check-ins daily or weekly?""
- ""Which of these three approaches feels most natural to you?""

### Recognition That Resonates 🏆

Different people value different types of recognition. Some prefer public acknowledgment, others appreciate private feedback. Some want tangible rewards, others value increased responsibility. Pay attention to what energizes each individual and customize your approach accordingly.

---

## Communication Techniques That Connect 🗣️

### The Curiosity Approach

Instead of: ""Why aren't you more motivated?""
Try: ""Help me understand what would make this project more engaging for you?""

Instead of: ""You need to step up your game""
Try: ""What obstacles are preventing you from doing your best work?""

### Progress Visualization 📈

Help them see their impact through concrete examples:
- ""Remember when you struggled with X? Look how naturally you handle it now""
- ""Your contribution to last week's project saved us significant time""
- ""Here's how your work directly benefits our customers/family/team""

### Future Pacing

Connect current actions to future benefits they care about:
- ""Mastering this skill will open doors for the career path you mentioned""
- ""This experience will build the confidence you're looking for""
- ""Learning this now will make your life much easier later""

---

## Creating Supportive Environments 🏠

### Physical Space Matters

Whether at home or work, the environment significantly impacts motivation:
- Ensure adequate lighting and comfortable seating
- Minimize distractions and noise
- Provide necessary tools and resources
- Create spaces that encourage both focus and collaboration

### Emotional Safety Nets 💝

People take more initiative when they feel safe to make mistakes:
- Establish that learning from failures is expected and valued
- Share your own mistakes and what you learned from them
- Create systems for getting help without judgment
- Celebrate effort and improvement, not just results

---

## Long-term Development Strategies 🚀

### Skill Building Without Pressure

Identify gaps between their current abilities and what success requires, then:
- Offer training opportunities without making them feel deficient
- Connect them with mentors who share similar backgrounds or interests
- Provide resources for self-directed learning
- Create low-stakes practice opportunities

### Gradual Responsibility Increases 📊

Start with tasks they can definitely handle, then slowly expand:
- Begin with clear, achievable assignments
- Add complexity only after demonstrating competence
- Provide scaffolding and support during transitions
- Celebrate each level of increased responsibility

### Personal Goal Integration 🎯

Help them connect team objectives with their personal aspirations:
- Regular one-on-one conversations about their individual goals
- Finding overlap between organizational needs and personal interests
- Supporting their growth even when it doesn't directly benefit the immediate situation
- Being genuinely invested in their long-term success

---

## Handling Setbacks and Resistance 🛠️

### When Progress Stalls

Expect ups and downs. Some days will be better than others. When motivation dips:
- Revisit what was working before
- Check if external factors are creating stress
- Adjust expectations temporarily if needed
- Maintain supportive contact without being pushy

### Addressing Direct Resistance 💪

Sometimes people actively push back against efforts to engage them. This often indicates:
- Previous negative experiences with authority figures
- Fear of increased expectations or workload
- Misalignment between their values and the situation
- Personal issues affecting their capacity

Respond with patience and curiosity rather than force. Sometimes the best approach is giving them space while keeping the door open for future engagement.

---

## Measuring Success Differently 📏

Traditional metrics don't always capture the full picture. Look for:

**Engagement Indicators** ✨
- Asking more questions during meetings or discussions
- Volunteering information without being prompted
- Showing up on time more consistently
- Contributing ideas, even small ones

**Relationship Improvements** 🤝
- More positive interactions with team members or family
- Increased willingness to ask for help
- Better communication about challenges
- Reduced conflict or tension

**Quality Changes** 🎨
- More attention to detail in their work
- Taking initiative on small improvements
- Following through on commitments more reliably
- Pride in their contributions becoming more visible

---

## The Ripple Effect: When One Person Changes Everything 🌊

Investing in someone who initially seems unmotivated often creates unexpected benefits for the entire group. Other team members notice when someone starts contributing more effectively. Family dynamics improve when everyone feels valued and engaged. The person who was once seen as a challenge becomes an advocate for the positive culture you've created.

This approach also models behavior that others can apply in their own relationships, creating a multiplying effect of positive influence throughout your environment.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️

### The Quick Fix Mentality

Changing someone's engagement level takes time. Expecting immediate transformation often leads to frustration for everyone involved.

### One-Size-Fits-All Solutions

What motivates one person may completely discourage another. Stay flexible and personalize your approach.

### Giving Up Too Soon

Sometimes progress isn't visible for weeks or months. Consistency matters more than intensity.

### Making It About You

Keep the focus on their success and growth, not on proving your leadership abilities or getting credit.

---

## Beyond the Individual: System-Level Changes 🔧

Sometimes the issue isn't with the person but with the system they're operating within. Consider whether:
- Role expectations are clearly defined
- Resources are adequate for success
- The reward system aligns with desired behaviors
- Communication channels are effective
- The overall culture supports growth and learning

Making systemic improvements benefits everyone and often resolves individual motivation issues automatically.

---

## The Long View: Building Sustainable Motivation 🌱

True motivation comes from within, but external conditions can either nurture or suppress it. Your goal isn't to motivate someone temporarily - it's to create conditions where their natural motivation can emerge and flourish.

This means:
- Focusing on intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivators
- Building capabilities that increase confidence
- Creating meaningful connections between effort and results
- Developing their sense of autonomy and control
- Connecting their work to purposes they find meaningful

---

## When Professional Help Makes Sense 🔍

Sometimes what appears to be lack of motivation is actually depression, anxiety, learning differences, or other challenges that require professional support. Know when to suggest resources like:
- Employee assistance programs at work
- Counseling or therapy services
- Learning and development assessments
- Health and wellness support
- Financial or legal assistance if those are contributing factors

Supporting someone doesn't mean taking responsibility for fixing everything yourself.

---

## Cultural Considerations and Inclusive Approaches 🌍

Different backgrounds create different relationships with authority, teamwork, and individual achievement. What looks like lack of ambition might be:
- Cultural values that prioritize collective over individual success
- Different communication styles that don't match dominant group norms
- Language barriers affecting comprehension or expression
- Economic pressures creating competing priorities
- Historical experiences with organizations or authority figures

Effective approaches acknowledge these differences and adapt accordingly rather than expecting everyone to respond identically to the same strategies.

## Conclusion: The Art of Human Development 🎨

Working effectively with people who initially seem unmotivated is one of the most valuable skills you can develop. It requires patience, creativity, empathy, and persistence. But the rewards - both for them and for you - make the effort worthwhile.

Remember that everyone has potential. Your job isn't to create motivation where none exists, but to remove barriers and create conditions where natural human drives can emerge and flourish. When you succeed, you don't just help one person - you contribute to a culture where everyone feels valued, supported, and capable of growth.

The strategies outlined here work because they're based on fundamental human needs: to feel competent, connected, and autonomous. When these needs are met, motivation follows naturally. When they're not, even talented people struggle to engage fully.

Start small, be consistent, and focus on building genuine relationships. The investment in understanding and supporting others pays dividends far beyond any single project or goal. You're not just improving immediate performance - you're contributing to someone's long-term development and well-being.

In our interconnected world, the ability to bring out the best in others isn't just a nice skill to have - it's essential for creating families, teams, and communities that thrive together. Every person you help engage more fully becomes someone who can do the same for others, creating positive ripples that extend far beyond your direct influence.

The methodology presented here transcends specific circumstances or time periods because it's based on timeless human needs and psychology. Whether applied in today's digital workplace or centuries from now in contexts we can't yet imagine, these principles for understanding and engaging with others will remain relevant and effective.

Take the first step today. Choose one person in your life who seems disconnected or unmotivated. Commit to understanding them better and applying these strategies consistently. The transformation you witness - both in them and in yourself - will inspire you to continue building bridges instead of walls wherever you go.

*Supporting others in finding their motivation isn't just good leadership - it's good humanity. In a world that often emphasizes competition and individual achievement, choosing to invest in others' success creates the kind of environment where everyone can flourish.*

1n4mr4b,https://i.redd.it/w6i0dskelamf1.png,"Give Faln a theme. Lyrical, random UT AU, just a theme. Probably a boss theme.","
**Name:** Faln **Title:** Angel of Judgment, Guardian of Heaven **Power Level:** Apocalyptic Tier (canonically more powerful than Zenith, the leader of Heaven) **Personality:** The celestial equivalent of a minimum-wage night shift worker who has *completely* checked out.

In the beginning, when Heaven was still scaffolding and stardust, the Architect forged Faln from raw law and divine inevitability—a being of absolute judgment, whose word could unmake galaxies and whose gaze alone could reduce the damned to whispers in the ether.

Faln was created not to lead, not to rule, but to **keep the balance**. Justice, in its coldest, purest form. No compassion. No wrath. Just the ledger and the blade.

And for a time, Faln fulfilled this role with terrifying precision. They passed judgment on fallen stars and rebellious cherubim, sealing ancient evils in the Abyss without flinching. Empires rose and fell under their watchful eye. Even Zenith, Heaven’s vaunted leader, once stood trial before Faln in a long-forgotten age—and was only spared due to a bureaucratic loophole. Since then, Zenith has ruled, and Faln has watched. Quietly. Begrudgingly.

But as eons crawled by, something... shifted.

Faln, eternal and unchanging, began to burn out.

Not in power—no, their divine might remained intact, vast beyond comprehension—but in *interest*. Aeons of listening to mortals whine, angels politic, and demons monologue about vengeance slowly eroded their divine enthusiasm.

Now? Faln’s sword of judgment is perpetually stuck half-sheathed. Their robes are wrinkled. Their wings? Untouched in millennia, covered in celestial dust. They sit outside the Gates of Heaven in a folding chair they conjured from nothing, sipping divine coffee and doomscrolling fate tablets. When called upon, they’ll show up—but don’t expect fireworks.

You might hear:

""Oh, wow. Another soul pleading for clemency. How *original.*"" ""Yeah, I could smite you into concept dust, but I’ve got three trials ahead of you and a migraine shaped like Purgatory."" ""Zenith wants me to ‘intervene’? Tell him to file it in triplicate and shove it into the eternal suggestion box known as the void.""

Despite the apathy, no one crosses Faln. Even the Demon Princes speak of them in hushed tones—because beneath the boredom lies power **older than creation**, just waiting for a good enough reason to snap awake.

Heaven prays Faln never finds that reason.

Quotes (bc why not)

“Justice isn’t blind. It’s just tired of looking at you.” “Do I care? No. Am I gonna vaporize you anyway? Also no. Paperwork.” “If Heaven falls, I’ll be on break. Don’t text.”

""I've been waiting for you for a long time. You were the first to make me truly feel something in the past few centuries. But that feeling? It's hate. Hatred to you. The things you've done. The lives you've ended...I've had enough. This may be breaking protocol, but I don't care. I'm finishing you, here and now...

1n4momo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1n4momo/finally_back_on_nights/,Finally back on nights,"I work as a 911 dispatcher. Prior to this I worked many years as a bartender. My entire life I’ve been that girl who wakes up at noon and stays awake until 3 am on “school nights”. It was a running joke about me when I was a child through my 20s, that I would sleep until 3 pm given half the chance. 

The last year or so I’ve been on day shift. I’ve been miserable. Waking up at 6 am for me is just…torture. Like genuine torture. I rarely get to bed before 2 am regardless of what day of the week it is, and as my bf has pointed out, on my weekends I’m regularly awake until about 5 am. I just…can’t help it.

Anyway I finally switched my shift back. I had gone to days to mostly benefit everyone else in my life. Including my boyfriend. But I’m just…done. I love them all but I can’t fight my body’s natural rhythm this way anymore.

Starting tomorrow I’ll be working 7 pm -7 am again and I’m so excited 😆

Anyone else here just love nights? Like it’s not a chore for me at all. I love how quiet the world is a night. I love how it’s cooler. I love the moon. I love getting off work and hitting a 7 am spin class 🥸 I love coffee at 5 pm. 

And I fricken LOVE sleeping a full 8 hours 😭😭😭 

When I started nights at my job a lot of people told me that I’d struggle—I wouldn’t be able to sleep, I’d workout less, I’d gain weight. But all of that happened to me on day shift. I gained literally about 40 lbs, I stopped exercising, I got so depressed because I couldn’t fricken sleep. All of my problems on nights came from me trying to “flip” my schedule to please other people, and I’d end up trying to stay awake long past my bedtime to “rejoin the real world”. 

I’m just so happy to go back. I won’t be “flipping” this time.

*Transform your approach to handling financially careless individuals in any setting*

---

## 🎯 The Universal Challenge We All Face

Every workplace, family, and social circle has that one person. You know exactly who I'm thinking about - the individual who consistently makes questionable financial decisions, borrows money with creative repayment schedules, or somehow always finds themselves in monetary predicaments that somehow become everyone else's problem.

Whether it's your colleague who constantly ""forgets"" their wallet during lunch outings, your family member who treats your savings account like their personal emergency fund, or that team member who somehow never has their share for group expenses, dealing with financially irresponsible behavior requires a strategic, compassionate yet firm approach.

## 🔍 Understanding the Root Patterns

Before jumping into solutions, let's examine the common behaviors that signal financial irresponsibility:

**The Chronic Borrower** 💸
This person has elevated asking for money to an art form. Small amounts at first, then gradually larger sums. They possess an uncanny ability to time their requests perfectly - right when you're feeling generous or when saying no feels particularly awkward.

**The Excuse Expert** 🎭
Every financial mishap comes with an elaborate backstory. Car repairs, unexpected bills, family emergencies - their life reads like a series of unfortunate events. While some situations are genuinely beyond their control, the pattern reveals poor planning and crisis management.

**The Lifestyle Inflator** 🎪
Despite constant money troubles, they somehow maintain expensive habits. Designer coffee, latest gadgets, frequent dining out - their priorities seem mysteriously misaligned with their proclaimed financial constraints.

**The Responsibility Dodger** 🏃‍♂️
When group expenses arise, they're suddenly absent, their phone dies, or they promise to ""get you next time."" They've mastered the art of being present for benefits but absent for contributions.

## 🛠️ The Strategic Response Framework

### Phase 1: Document and Observe 📋

Start by quietly tracking patterns. Note dates, amounts, circumstances, and follow-through rates. This isn't about building a case against someone - it's about understanding the scope and frequency of issues. Documentation helps you respond objectively rather than emotionally.

Keep records simple:
- Date of incident
- Nature of request or situation
- Amount involved
- Promised resolution timeline
- Actual outcome

### Phase 2: Establish Clear Boundaries 🚧

**Personal Financial Firewall**
Create non-negotiable rules for yourself. Decide in advance your maximum lending amount, frequency limits, and circumstances where you'll say no. Having predetermined boundaries makes in-the-moment decisions easier and more consistent.

**Communication Protocol**
Develop standard responses for common situations. Practice phrases like:
- ""I've allocated my discretionary funds for this month""
- ""I'm not comfortable mixing money with our relationship""
- ""Let's brainstorm some alternative solutions""

**Group Setting Rules**
For team environments, establish upfront agreements about shared expenses. Use apps that track contributions, require advance payments, or rotate responsibility among reliable members.

### Phase 3: The Compassionate Confrontation 💬

When addressing the behavior directly becomes necessary, timing and approach matter tremendously.

**Choose Private Settings**
Never address financial irresponsibility in group settings. This creates defensiveness and potentially damages relationships beyond repair.

**Focus on Impact, Not Character**
Instead of labeling someone as ""irresponsible,"" describe specific impacts: ""When plans change last-minute due to payment issues, it affects everyone's experience"" rather than ""You're always causing problems with money.""

**Offer Collaborative Solutions**
Present the conversation as problem-solving together rather than accusation and defense. ""How can we structure future group activities so everyone feels comfortable participating?""

## 🎪 Advanced Management Techniques

### The Natural Consequences Approach 🌱

Allow reality to be the teacher rather than constantly rescuing them from poor choices. This requires discipline on your part to resist the urge to solve their problems.

**In Family Settings:**
If an adult family member consistently overspends, avoid repeatedly bailing them out. Offer non-financial support instead - help them create budgets, research resources, or develop skills.

**In Professional Environments:**
Let company policies handle issues rather than personal interventions. If someone can't afford group lunches, they'll naturally learn to bring lunch or find alternatives.

**In Social Circles:**
Plan activities within everyone's stated budget, but don't subsidize those who claim financial constraints while making other expensive choices.

### The Skill-Building Investment 🎓

Sometimes financial irresponsibility stems from lack of knowledge rather than lack of character. Consider whether education might address the root cause.

**Practical Education Opportunities:**
- Share budgeting apps or tools casually
- Recommend books or podcasts about financial planning
- Invite them to attend financial literacy workshops
- Model good financial decision-making in your interactions

**Skill Development Support:**
Help them develop earning potential rather than just giving money. This might involve:
- Career mentoring or networking connections
- Skill-sharing in areas where you have expertise
- Connecting them with relevant opportunities or resources

### The Graduated Response System ⚖️

Create increasingly firm boundaries based on repeated behavior:

**First Instances:** Benefit of doubt, normal helpfulness
**Repeated Patterns:** Gentle boundary setting, alternative suggestions
**Chronic Issues:** Firm boundaries, natural consequences
**Severe Cases:** Complete financial separation, relationship evaluation

## 🏠 Context-Specific Strategies

### Family Dynamics 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Family situations require extra delicacy due to ongoing relationships and emotional complexity.

**Spouse or Partner Situations:**
Financial irresponsibility in committed relationships requires immediate, serious attention. Consider:
- Joint financial counseling
- Separate accounts with agreed-upon contributions
- Professional mediation if needed
- Clear consequences for continued problematic behavior

**Adult Children or Siblings:**
Tough love often works better than enabling. Provide emotional support while maintaining financial boundaries. Help them develop independence rather than dependence.

**Extended Family:**
You can choose your level of involvement. Set clear expectations about what you will and won't do financially, and stick to them consistently.

### Workplace Scenarios 🏢

Professional environments offer both opportunities and constraints for addressing financial issues.

**Direct Reports:**
If someone's financial stress affects their work performance, address it professionally. Offer employee assistance resources, but avoid personal financial involvement.

**Colleagues and Peers:**
Keep interactions friendly but financially separate. Use company policies and procedures to handle shared expenses fairly.

**Supervisors:**
Document any ways their financial issues impact work, but avoid becoming their financial advisor or lender.

### Friend Groups 👥

Friendships can survive financial disagreements with the right approach.

**Close Friends:**
Have honest conversations about money expectations. True friends will respect your boundaries and work together on solutions.

**Casual Friendships:**
Keep financial interactions minimal and straightforward. Don't complicate casual relationships with money issues.

**Group Activities:**
Plan inclusive activities or have transparent cost-sharing arrangements that work for everyone's actual (not claimed) budgets.

## 🚀 Long-Term Relationship Preservation

### Maintaining Respect While Setting Boundaries 🤝

It's possible to address financial irresponsibility without damaging relationships permanently, but it requires skillful navigation.

**Acknowledge Their Worth Beyond Money:**
Regularly affirm their positive qualities and contributions that aren't financial. This prevents them from feeling defined solely by their money management issues.

**Separate Financial Boundaries from Personal Affection:**
Make it clear that your financial boundaries don't reflect your feelings about them as a person. ""I care about you, which is why I think it's important we keep money separate from our relationship.""

**Offer Non-Financial Support:**
Be generous with time, advice, emotional support, and encouragement. This demonstrates that your boundaries aren't about being stingy or uncaring.

### Celebrating Progress 🎉

When you notice improvements in their financial behavior, acknowledge it positively. People change more readily when progress is recognized rather than when only problems get attention.

Small wins deserve recognition:
- Paying back loans on time
- Declining group activities they can't afford
- Making more realistic financial commitments
- Showing improved planning or budgeting

## 🎯 The Prevention Mindset

### Creating Environments That Support Good Financial Behavior 🌟

Rather than just responding to problems, consider how to structure interactions that naturally discourage financial irresponsibility.

**Transparent Systems:**
Use apps, spreadsheets, or clear agreements for any shared financial responsibilities. Transparency reduces both temptation and confusion.

**Advance Planning:**
For group activities, discuss costs upfront and collect payments in advance. This eliminates last-minute ""surprises"" and gives people time to plan appropriately.

**Alternative Options:**
Always have lower-cost alternatives available. This removes the excuse factor and demonstrates inclusion without financial pressure.

### Teaching by Example 📚

Your own financial behavior sends powerful messages about what's normal and acceptable.

**Model Good Practices:**
- Stick to budgets publicly
- Decline activities you can't afford
- Plan ahead for expenses
- Keep financial commitments religiously

**Share Learning Experiences:**
Talk openly about your own financial learning journey, mistakes you've made, and systems that work for you. This normalizes financial planning as an ongoing skill rather than an innate talent.

## 🎪 Special Situations and Exceptions

### When to Break Your Own Rules 🚨

Sometimes circumstances genuinely warrant exceptions to your normal boundaries. The key is making these exceptions consciously rather than being manipulated into them.

**Genuine Emergencies:**
True emergencies are rare and usually involve health, safety, or legal issues that couldn't be anticipated or planned for.

**Temporary Setbacks:**
Job loss, medical issues, or other major life disruptions may warrant temporary adjustment of your usual boundaries.

**Learning Opportunities:**
Sometimes helping once in a specific way can create a teachable moment that leads to lasting positive change.

**Time-Limited Situations:**
If you know their financial stress has a clear end date (graduation, job start date, etc.), you might choose temporary flexibility.

### Recognizing Manipulation Tactics 🎭

Financially irresponsible people often develop sophisticated influence techniques. Recognizing these helps you respond thoughtfully rather than reactively.

**Emotional Manipulation:**
- Guilt trips about past favors or relationships
- Dramatic presentations of consequences
- Comparisons to what others would do
- Timing requests during emotional moments

**Social Pressure:**
- Public requests that are hard to refuse
- Involving others in their financial drama
- Creating situations where saying no seems cruel
- Using group dynamics to their advantage

**False Urgency:**
- Claiming immediate deadlines that later prove flexible
- Manufacturing crisis situations
- Using children or family members as emotional leverage
- Creating artificial scarcity or time pressure

## 🌟 The Bigger Picture: Building Financial Culture

### Individual Impact on Group Dynamics 🌊

One person's financial irresponsibility can negatively impact entire families, teams, or friend groups. Addressing it skillfully benefits everyone.

**Preventing Resentment:**
When one person consistently creates financial stress for others, resentment builds. Clear boundaries prevent this toxicity from spreading.

**Modeling Standards:**
How you handle financial irresponsibility teaches others what behavior is acceptable. Your response influences the entire group's norms.

**Protecting Resources:**
Groups have collective financial resources - time, energy, and money. Protecting these from misuse benefits everyone's wellbeing.

### Creating Positive Financial Conversations 💰

Transform your environment's relationship with money from reactive problem-solving to proactive planning and support.

**Normalize Financial Planning:**
Make budgeting, saving, and financial goal-setting regular conversation topics rather than taboo subjects.

**Share Resources:**
Openly discuss helpful financial tools, strategies, and learning opportunities you've discovered.

**Celebrate Financial Wins:**
Acknowledge when people make good financial choices, reach savings goals, or demonstrate improved money management.

## 🎯 Your Action Plan Moving Forward

### Week 1: Assessment Phase 📊
- Identify the financially irresponsible individuals in your various circles
- Document recent patterns and impacts on you
- Clarify your current boundaries and where they need strengthening
- Assess which relationships warrant continued investment

### Week 2: Boundary Setting 🚧
- Decide your new financial boundaries for different relationship types
- Practice language for communicating these boundaries
- Create systems to support your boundaries (apps, policies, etc.)
- Prepare responses for common manipulation tactics

### Week 3: Implementation 🚀
- Begin applying new boundaries consistently
- Have necessary conversations with key individuals
- Start modeling the financial behavior you want to see
- Document results and adjust approaches as needed

### Week 4: Evaluation and Adjustment ⚖️
- Assess what's working and what needs refinement
- Celebrate progress you've made in protecting your financial wellbeing
- Plan longer-term strategies for relationship development
- Identify resources for continued skill building

## 🎉 The Transformation Opportunity

Dealing with financially irresponsible people isn't just about protecting yourself - it's an opportunity to create healthier financial cultures in all your circles. When you respond skillfully, you model emotional intelligence, clear communication, and healthy boundary-setting that benefits everyone involved.

Remember that change takes time, both for others and for yourself as you develop new skills. Be patient with the process while remaining firm with your boundaries. The goal isn't to punish anyone or prove points - it's to create sustainable relationships where everyone can thrive financially and emotionally.

Your future self will thank you for the discipline and courage it takes to address these issues directly rather than hoping they'll resolve themselves. Every boundary you set and maintain contributes to a healthier, more respectful environment for everyone.

The most powerful change often happens not through dramatic confrontations but through consistent, principled responses that demonstrate what healthy financial relationships actually look like. You have the opportunity to be that positive influence in your circles, creating ripple effects that extend far beyond any single financial transaction.

Start today. Start small. Start with clarity about what you will and won't accept. The path to healthier financial relationships begins with your next interaction.

*Remember: You cannot control others' financial choices, but you can control your responses to them. Focus your energy on what you can influence - your boundaries, your communication, and your own financial wellbeing.*

Picture this: You're in a team meeting, and one colleague constantly interrupts with phrases like ""Don't you think I did great on that project?"" or ""Did everyone notice how early I arrived today?"" Sound familiar? We've all encountered these validation-hungry individuals who seem to need constant reassurance about their worth, performance, and acceptance.

Whether it's a family member fishing for compliments, a coworker seeking endless praise, or a team member who can't make decisions without group approval, dealing with approval-seekers requires a delicate balance of compassion and boundary-setting. Let's explore practical strategies that work across all relationships and situations.

## Understanding the Approval-Seeker Mindset 🧠

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand what drives this behavior. Approval-seekers aren't inherently problematic people - they're often dealing with deep-seated insecurity, fear of rejection, or past experiences that taught them their worth depends on external validation.

These individuals typically exhibit patterns like:
- Constantly seeking reassurance about their decisions
- Fishing for compliments through self-deprecating comments
- Avoiding risks or independent choices
- Becoming anxious when they can't gauge others' approval
- Taking neutral responses as rejection

The key insight? Their behavior stems from genuine emotional needs, even when it becomes exhausting for those around them.

## The Foundation: Empathy Without Enabling 💪

Your first instinct might be to either shower them with constant praise or become frustrated and withdraw. Neither approach helps long-term. Instead, adopt what we'll call ""compassionate boundaries"" - understanding their need while not feeding the cycle.

Think of it like helping someone learn to swim. You wouldn't let them drown, but you also wouldn't carry them across every pool they encounter. The goal is building their confidence to navigate independently.

## Practical Strategies for Different Settings 🏠🏢

### In Family Dynamics

When dealing with family members who constantly seek approval, consistency becomes your superpower. Instead of giving automatic praise or criticism, try reflective responses:

Replace: ""Yes, you look beautiful"" (automatic validation)
With: ""You seem confident in that outfit - how do you feel about it?""

This approach acknowledges their concern while redirecting focus to their own judgment rather than yours. Over time, this helps them develop internal validation systems.

Set clear communication windows. If a family member constantly seeks approval for minor decisions, establish specific times for advice-giving: ""I'm happy to discuss important decisions with you on Sunday evenings, but for daily choices, I trust your judgment.""

### In Professional Environments

Workplace approval-seekers can significantly impact team productivity and morale. Your approach needs to be professional yet supportive, focusing on outcomes rather than personality traits.

When they seek validation for completed work, acknowledge effort while emphasizing results: ""The client feedback on this project shows strong results. What do you think made the difference in your approach?""

For decision-making situations, provide frameworks instead of answers. Instead of telling them what to do, offer structured thinking tools: ""When facing similar decisions, I usually consider three factors: timeline, resources, and impact. What does that analysis suggest to you?""

Create regular feedback schedules to prevent constant interruptions while ensuring they feel heard and guided.

### In Social Groups and Teams

Group dynamics with approval-seekers require careful navigation to maintain harmony while encouraging growth. The key lies in redirecting group attention toward constructive patterns.

When they make self-deprecating comments fishing for reassurance, avoid the obvious bait. Instead, redirect toward specifics: ""What specific aspect concerns you?"" This moves conversation from emotional reassurance to practical problem-solving.

Encourage peer-to-peer feedback rather than having all validation flow through you. This distributes the emotional labor and helps them build relationships with others.

## Advanced Techniques: Building Their Inner Compass 🧭

### The Question-Back Method

Instead of providing immediate validation or advice, reflect questions back to them. This technique strengthens their decision-making muscles without abandoning them.

When they ask: ""Do you think I should take this opportunity?""
Respond with: ""What factors are most important to you in making this choice?""

This approach respects their agency while providing support through the thinking process.

### The Success Archive Strategy

Help them document their independent successes. When they make good decisions or handle situations well, point it out specifically: ""I noticed you handled that conflict really effectively. What approach did you use?""

This builds a mental database of their capabilities, reducing future approval-seeking by reminding them of past competence.

### The Gradual Independence Plan

Like training wheels on a bicycle, gradually reduce your involvement in their decisions. Start with low-stakes situations and increase complexity as their confidence grows.

Week 1: Let them choose lunch spots without input
Week 2: Support them in handling minor work conflicts independently  
Week 3: Encourage them to make social plans without group consensus

Track progress and celebrate independent decision-making as much as successful outcomes.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ❌

### The Praise Trap

Constantly providing positive reinforcement can actually worsen approval-seeking behavior. It's like feeding a habit - the more you provide external validation, the more they'll need it.

### The Criticism Shutdown

Harsh criticism or complete withdrawal often triggers increased approval-seeking as they desperately try to repair the relationship. Find the middle ground of honest, constructive communication.

### The Savior Complex

Resist the urge to solve all their problems or make decisions for them. This creates dependency rather than growth.

### The Impatience Problem

Change takes time. Expecting immediate transformation will lead to frustration for both parties. Celebrate small improvements and maintain consistent approaches.

## Long-term Success Indicators 🎊

You'll know your approach is working when you notice:

- Longer gaps between approval-seeking behaviors
- More independent decision-making, even on small matters
- Increased willingness to take calculated risks
- Greater comfort with neutral or mixed feedback
- Reduced anxiety when they can't immediately gauge reactions

These changes often happen gradually, so document progress to stay motivated during challenging periods.

## Adapting Your Approach Over Time 🔄

As approval-seekers grow more confident, your role should evolve from active guidance to supportive presence. This means:

- Reducing the frequency of check-ins
- Allowing them to struggle with decisions before offering help
- Celebrating their independence as much as their successes
- Gradually increasing the complexity of situations they handle alone

Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate their need for connection and feedback - healthy humans need social validation. The objective is helping them develop balanced relationships with both internal and external sources of confidence.

## Creating Sustainable Change 🌱

The most effective approaches focus on building systems rather than managing individual incidents. This means:

Creating predictable feedback loops rather than random validation
Teaching decision-making frameworks they can apply independently
Building their confidence through documented successes
Establishing clear boundaries about when and how you'll provide support

These systemic changes create lasting transformation rather than temporary behavioral modifications.

## The Ripple Effect: Benefits for Everyone 🌊

When you successfully help approval-seekers develop independence, everyone benefits:

- Family dynamics become more balanced and less emotionally draining
- Team productivity improves as energy shifts from validation to results
- The individual develops genuine confidence and self-reliance
- Relationships become more authentic and mutually supportive

Your investment in their growth pays dividends across all areas of life.

## Conclusion: Patience, Consistency, and Compassion ✨

Dealing with approval-seekers isn't about changing them - it's about creating environments where they can grow into their authentic confidence. This requires patience with the process, consistency in your approach, and compassion for their underlying struggles.

Remember, behind every approval-seeker is someone who genuinely wants to contribute and belong. Your role is helping them discover they already have the tools for both success and acceptance within themselves.

The strategies outlined here work because they address root causes rather than surface behaviors. They respect the individual's autonomy while providing structured support for growth. Most importantly, they create sustainable change that benefits everyone involved.

Whether you're dealing with a family member, colleague, or team member, these approaches will help you navigate the relationship while encouraging genuine development. The key lies in maintaining your boundaries while offering consistent, thoughtful support.

Start small, stay consistent, and watch as approval-seekers transform into confident, independent contributors who enhance rather than drain the energy of those around them.

1n4mfnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenStuff/comments/1n4mfnz/kitchen_organization_gamechanger_magnetic_knife/,Kitchen organization game-changer: Magnetic knife strips aren't just for knives,"Okay, I need to come clean about something. For the past two years, I've been living with a cluttered utensil drawer that made me want to scream every time I tried to find my can opener. You know the drawer I'm talking about - the one where everything gets tangled together and you have to dig through a pile of metal just to find a single measuring spoon.

Last month, I installed a second magnetic knife strip in my kitchen, and it completely changed how I organize my space. I already had one for my knives, but I'd been eyeing this empty wall space next to my stove and thought, why not try mounting another one for other tools?

Best decision ever. That strip now holds my kitchen shears, can opener, meat thermometer, metal tongs, my favorite offset spatula, and even my measuring spoons. Everything I reach for constantly while cooking is right there at eye level, easy to grab and easy to put back. No more drawer diving while my onions are burning on the stove.

The weight limit surprised me though. My heavy-duty kitchen shears stay put no problem, but I learned the hard way that my massive BBQ tongs are too heavy and will slide down slowly over time. Had a nice little heart attack when they crashed into my coffee mug one morning. Now I stick to normal-sized tongs and lighter tools, and everything stays perfectly in place.

Installation tip if you're renting like me: I used heavy-duty command strips instead of drilling into the wall. It's been holding strong for a month now with about eight tools on it. Just make sure you get the strips rated for the weight and follow the instructions about letting them set for an hour before hanging the bar.

The unexpected bonus is that my kitchen actually looks more professional now. There's something about having your tools displayed and easily accessible that makes you feel like you know what you're doing, even when you're just making boxed mac and cheese at 11pm. Plus, my partner finally stops asking me where everything is because it's all visible.

If you're dealing with cramped drawers or limited storage, seriously consider getting an extra magnetic strip or two. Just maybe start with lighter tools until you figure out what your strip can handle. Your future cooking self will thank you when you're not frantically searching for that one specific tool while something's about to boil over.",5,1756617610.0,KitchenStuff,0,1.0,False

*Ever wondered why some people seem to find fault with everything? Here's your practical roadmap to turning workplace tensions into workplace harmony.*

---

## The Universal Challenge We All Face 🌍

Picture this: You're presenting your best work, feeling confident and prepared. Then *that person* speaks up – the one who always finds the flaw, the missing detail, the reason why it won't work. Sound familiar?

Whether it's your colleague who nitpicks every proposal, your family member who criticizes every decision, or that team member who turns brainstorming sessions into fault-finding missions, we've all encountered the overly critical person. The good news? There's a method to manage this dynamic that works across cultures, generations, and situations.

## Understanding the Critical Mind 🧠

Before diving into solutions, let's decode what drives excessive criticism. Most overly critical individuals aren't intentionally difficult – they're often:

**Perfectionist by nature** 🎯
Their high standards become a lens through which they view everything. What looks like criticism to you feels like quality control to them.

**Fear-driven decision makers** ⚠️
They spot potential problems because they're genuinely concerned about failure. Their criticism comes from a place of wanting things to succeed.

**Detail-oriented thinkers** 🔍
Their brains are wired to notice what others miss. This superpower becomes a challenge when every tiny flaw gets equal attention.

**Past experience carriers** 📚
Previous failures or disappointments have taught them to be cautious. They're trying to protect the team from repeating mistakes.

## The Golden Framework: BRIDGE 🌉

Here's your practical, step-by-step approach to managing critical personalities:

### B - Build Understanding First 🤝

Start every interaction by acknowledging their perspective. Instead of getting defensive, try phrases like:
- ""I can see you've put thought into identifying potential issues""
- ""Your attention to detail is valuable to our success""
- ""Help me understand your main concern here""

This doesn't mean agreeing with everything – it means showing respect for their input while creating space for dialogue.

### R - Redirect Energy Constructively ⚡

Channel their critical thinking toward solutions rather than just problems. Ask questions like:
- ""Given these concerns, what would you recommend we do differently?""
- ""How can we address this issue while moving forward?""
- ""What would success look like from your perspective?""

Transform them from problem-identifiers into problem-solvers. Their analytical nature becomes an asset when directed properly.

### I - Implement Boundaries Kindly but Firmly 🚧

Set clear expectations about how feedback gets delivered. Establish ground rules:
- Criticism should come with suggested improvements
- Focus on the most critical issues first
- Timing matters – not every meeting needs to become a critique session
- Private feedback often works better than public criticism

Be consistent in enforcing these boundaries while maintaining respect for the person.

### D - Develop Their Strengths 💪

Give them specific roles that utilize their critical thinking positively:
- Quality assurance responsibilities
- Risk assessment tasks
- Process improvement projects
- Mentoring roles for attention to detail

When their natural tendencies align with their responsibilities, everyone wins.

### G - Generate Positive Momentum 🚀

Celebrate when they contribute constructively. Acknowledge improvements in their approach:
- ""Your suggestion about the timeline really helped us avoid problems""
- ""Thanks for catching that issue early – it saved us significant effort""
- ""Your thorough review made this project much stronger""

Positive reinforcement encourages more of the behavior you want to see.

### E - Establish Regular Check-ins 📅

Don't wait for problems to escalate. Schedule regular one-on-one conversations to:
- Address concerns before they become public criticisms
- Provide them with a designated space to share detailed feedback
- Work together on improving team dynamics
- Show that their input matters even when delivery needs adjustment

## Daily Application Strategies 📋

**Morning Team Meetings** ☀️
Start with wins from the previous day before discussing challenges. This sets a solution-focused tone that naturally guides critical thinkers toward constructive input.

**Project Planning Sessions** 📊
Assign the critical person as ""devil's advocate"" for specific portions of the discussion. Give them official permission to find flaws within defined timeframes, then shift focus to solutions.

**Email Communications** 📧
When responding to critical feedback via email, always lead with acknowledgment, follow with clarification questions, and end with next steps. This keeps conversations moving forward rather than spiraling into debates.

**Conflict Resolution Moments** ⚖️
Use the ""Yes, and..."" technique instead of ""Yes, but..."" This validates their concern while adding your perspective, creating collaboration rather than opposition.

## Real-World Applications Across Different Settings 🌐

**Family Dynamics** 🏠
At family gatherings, give the critical family member a specific role – perhaps they're in charge of logistics or planning. Their attention to detail becomes helpful rather than annoying.

**Workplace Teams** 💼
Create ""improvement sprints"" where the critical team member leads efforts to enhance processes. Their natural tendencies become officially valuable.

**Friend Groups** 👥
When planning activities, ask for their input early in private conversations. Address their concerns before group discussions, reducing public criticism.

**Community Organizations** 🤝
Put them on committees where thorough analysis is crucial – budget review, safety planning, or quality standards development.

## The Long-Term Transformation 🔄

Remember, changing relationship dynamics takes time. Your goal isn't to eliminate their critical nature – it's to channel it productively. Here's what success looks like:

**Week 1-2**: Reduced defensiveness in interactions
**Month 1**: More solution-focused conversations
**Month 3**: Improved team dynamics and productivity
**Month 6**: The critical person becomes a valued contributor rather than a source of frustration

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Challenges 🎯

**The Reflection Method** 🪞
When someone offers excessive criticism, reflect their concern back with a question: ""It sounds like you're worried about quality standards. What specific outcome are you hoping to avoid?""

**The Partnership Approach** 🤝
Instead of seeing them as opposition, treat them as a partner in problem-solving: ""I need your expertise to help us avoid potential pitfalls. Can we work together to identify the top three risks?""

**The Time-Boxing Strategy** ⏰
Allocate specific time periods for critical analysis, then move to solution mode: ""Let's spend 10 minutes identifying concerns, then 20 minutes developing responses.""

## When to Seek Additional Support 🆘

Sometimes individual approaches aren't enough. Consider involving supervisors, HR, or professional mediators when:
- Criticism becomes personal rather than professional
- Team productivity significantly decreases
- Multiple people express distress about the situation
- The critical behavior escalates rather than improves

## Your Action Plan Starting Today 📝

**Immediate Steps** (Next 24 Hours):
- Identify one overly critical person in your life
- Choose one BRIDGE technique to try in your next interaction
- Prepare three solution-focused questions to redirect criticism

**This Week**:
- Practice acknowledgment phrases in low-stakes situations
- Observe patterns in when and how criticism typically emerges
- Test one boundary-setting conversation

**This Month**:
- Implement regular check-ins with the critical person
- Track improvements in team or family dynamics
- Adjust your approach based on what's working

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

When you successfully manage overly critical relationships, the benefits extend far beyond that single interaction. Teams become more collaborative, family gatherings become more enjoyable, and everyone's stress levels decrease. Your new skills become a model for others dealing with similar challenges.

Most importantly, you'll discover that many overly critical people have valuable insights hidden beneath their delivery style. By learning to extract the gold from their feedback while managing the rough edges, you access knowledge and perspectives that can genuinely improve outcomes.

## Remember This 💡

Every overly critical person you encounter is practicing a behavior they learned somewhere, somehow. Your patient, strategic approach doesn't just improve your current situation – it models a better way of interacting that they can learn and apply in their other relationships.

The investment you make in these challenging relationships often pays the highest dividends. The critical thinker who learns to channel their abilities constructively becomes one of your most valuable allies.

Start today. Choose one technique. Practice patience. Watch transformation happen, one interaction at a time.

---

*The next time someone offers harsh criticism, remember: you're not just managing a difficult moment – you're building skills that will serve you for decades to come. Every challenging person is actually an opportunity to become more skilled at human dynamics.*

**Your journey to better relationships starts with your very next conversation.** 🚀

She messaged me and said “if these idiots don’t want me here they should study harder and take my job so that I’m not required any more”.

I wonder why we don’t have the same shortage of food or cars that we do housing when we allow record numbers of migrants in. We treat housing as an investment rather than a consumable, so of course powerful people aren’t incentivised to give us affordable housing.

## Understanding the Challenge We All Face

Every workplace, family, and social circle has them – those individuals who seem to operate behind an invisible emotional barrier. They're physically present but emotionally elusive, contributing to tasks while remaining mysteriously detached from deeper connections. These emotionally distant colleagues, family members, or teammates present a unique challenge that requires patience, strategy, and genuine understanding.

## Recognizing the Signs 🔍

Emotionally unavailable individuals often display predictable patterns. They redirect personal conversations toward work topics, respond to emotional situations with logic-heavy solutions, maintain professional but surface-level relationships, and seem uncomfortable during moments requiring vulnerability or empathy. They might excel at problem-solving but struggle when situations demand emotional intelligence or personal connection.

Understanding these patterns isn't about labeling or judging – it's about developing realistic expectations and effective communication strategies.

## The Psychology Behind Emotional Distance 🧠

People become emotionally guarded for countless reasons. Past disappointments, cultural backgrounds that prioritize stoicism, overwhelming responsibilities, or simply different personality wiring can create these protective barriers. Some individuals learned early that emotional expression felt unsafe or unproductive, leading them to develop alternative coping mechanisms.

Rather than viewing emotional distance as a character flaw, consider it a different operating system – one that processes connection and communication through alternative channels.

## Building Bridges: Practical Strategies That Work ✨

### Start Small and Stay Consistent

Major breakthroughs rarely happen overnight. Instead, focus on tiny, consistent gestures that demonstrate reliability without demanding emotional reciprocity. Share brief, relevant updates about projects. Acknowledge their contributions specifically. Offer practical assistance without strings attached.

These small touches create safety over time, showing that connection doesn't always require emotional vulnerability.

### Communicate Through Their Preferred Channels

Emotionally distant people often feel more comfortable expressing care through actions rather than words, logic rather than emotion, or private conversations rather than group settings. Pay attention to how they naturally show consideration – perhaps through detailed project assistance, remembering important deadlines, or offering practical solutions during stressful times.

Mirror these communication styles when building rapport. If they express concern through detailed problem-solving, acknowledge their care language and respond accordingly.

### Respect Their Boundaries While Maintaining Your Own 🛡️

The key to sustainable relationships with emotionally distant individuals lies in respecting their comfort zones while maintaining your own needs. This means accepting their communication style without compromising your requirement for meaningful connection.

You might need to find emotional fulfillment through other relationships while appreciating the unique value this person brings to your life – perhaps their reliability, analytical thinking, or steady presence during crisis situations.

## Workplace Applications: Creating Professional Harmony 💼

In office environments, emotionally distant team members often excel at specific functions while struggling with collaborative elements. Instead of forcing traditional team-building approaches, consider alternative strategies:

Schedule one-on-one check-ins rather than group emotional processing sessions. Focus discussions on project outcomes and practical concerns rather than feelings about the work. Acknowledge their contributions publicly through concrete examples rather than general praise.

Create structured opportunities for them to share expertise, as many emotionally distant individuals feel more comfortable connecting through knowledge exchange than personal sharing.

## Family Dynamics: Maintaining Connection Across Different Styles 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Family relationships with emotionally distant members require long-term patience and adjusted expectations. Instead of pushing for traditional expressions of affection, look for their unique ways of showing care – perhaps through practical support, remembering important details, or consistent presence during difficult times.

Establish family communication patterns that work for everyone. Some families benefit from structured check-ins focused on practical matters, with emotional connection happening naturally within these safer frameworks.

## Daily Life Integration: Simple Techniques for Everyone 🌟

### The Documentation Approach

Keep mental notes of what works and what doesn't in your interactions. Emotionally distant individuals often have consistent patterns – certain topics they engage with enthusiastically, specific ways they prefer receiving information, particular situations where they seem more open to connection.

Use this information to optimize future interactions without making them feel analyzed or manipulated.

### The Value Recognition Method

Focus on appreciating what they do contribute rather than lamenting what they don't. Perhaps they're the person everyone calls during emergencies, the one who remembers important details others forget, or the steady presence when emotions run high.

Regularly acknowledging these contributions helps both of you appreciate the relationship's unique value.

### The Parallel Play Technique

Sometimes the best connection happens during shared activities rather than face-to-face conversations. Working on projects together, participating in structured activities, or simply being present in the same space can create meaningful connection without requiring emotional vulnerability.

## Long-term Perspective: Building Sustainable Relationships 📈

Success with emotionally distant individuals requires adjusting your timeline and expectations. Progress might look like slightly more personal conversations after months of consistency, willingness to share practical concerns, or increased reliability in collaborative efforts.

These incremental changes often represent significant trust-building for someone who operates with emotional caution.

## When to Adjust Your Approach 🔄

Sometimes, despite consistent effort and understanding, certain relationships require boundary adjustments. If someone's emotional distance consistently undermines important projects, creates toxic team dynamics, or significantly impacts your well-being, it might be time to limit interaction or seek additional support.

The goal isn't changing anyone – it's creating sustainable, mutually beneficial relationships within realistic parameters.

## Creating Win-Win Scenarios 🎯

The most successful approaches benefit both parties. Emotionally distant individuals often appreciate relationships that don't demand constant emotional labor while still providing connection and mutual respect. You benefit by accessing their unique strengths – analytical thinking, steady reliability, practical problem-solving – without the frustration of unmet emotional expectations.

## Practical Implementation: Your Action Plan 📋

Begin by observing patterns in your current relationships with emotionally distant individuals. Notice their communication preferences, stress responses, and natural ways of showing consideration.

Experiment with matching their communication style while maintaining your authentic self. This might mean focusing conversations on shared interests, practical concerns, or collaborative projects rather than personal feelings.

Establish realistic timelines for relationship development. Instead of expecting immediate emotional intimacy, appreciate gradual increases in trust, communication, and mutual respect.

## The Broader Impact: Creating Inclusive Environments 🌍

Understanding and accommodating different emotional styles creates more inclusive families, workplaces, and communities. When we develop skills for connecting across emotional differences, everyone benefits from reduced conflict, improved collaboration, and more authentic relationships.

This approach also models emotional intelligence and adaptability – valuable skills that enhance all your relationships, not just challenging ones.

## Moving Forward: Sustainable Success 🚀

The most effective strategies for relating to emotionally distant individuals combine patience with practicality, understanding with boundaries, and acceptance with authenticity. These relationships often develop into uniquely valuable connections that provide stability, reliability, and different perspectives on life's challenges.

Remember that emotional availability exists on a spectrum, and many people move along this spectrum based on circumstances, stress levels, and relationship safety. Your consistent, respectful approach might contribute to someone feeling safer with emotional expression over time.

Focus on creating relationships where both parties feel valued for who they are rather than pressured to become someone different. This foundation supports long-term connection and mutual respect.

The journey of understanding and connecting with emotionally distant individuals ultimately teaches us about acceptance, communication flexibility, and the many different ways people can contribute meaningfully to our lives.

1n4mbzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/1n4mbzb/do_you_even_naked_raygun_bro/,Do you even Naked Raygun bro?,"Here’s a fun story for every punk rock kid that ever got gatekeeped on, and while the conversation is verbatim, this is otherwise completely true:

In 2014 my girlfriend (now wife) and I moved from Chicago to New Orleans. Our first apartment had no washer or dryer on the premises, so we had to schlep our duds down to Igor’s Buddha Belly on Magazine Street, which was the greatest place in Uptown IMO. They opened at 10am had a full bar and food menu, pool tables, a wall stacked with laundry units, an outdoor patio with joints constantly being being passed between strangers, and a small stage for live performances. You could hit a blunt, slam your beer, smash some fries, lose a quick hand at video poker, run up to sing “Movin’ Out” on karaoke, flip your laundry and sink the Eight, all in ten minutes without leaving the premises. It didn’t survive Covid sadly, but goddamit it was an institution.

I was working, so the Duchess was on laundry duty this particular day. She didn’t have much to wear, so she hauled it down to the Buddha in my Naked Raygun shirt. My wife, I should mention, looks like a perfect square, which is actually fairly accurate. She looked like a preppy, nerdy chick that got good grades and did gymnastics, which she pretty much was. She tutored all the bad punk rock girls and helped with their homework so they wouldn’t fail school, followed the rules, was kind to children, attentive to old people, and was generally a sweet, generous, and non-judgmental girl. She’d also punch you the fuck out in front of your friends in the right circumstances. Think Jason Siegel’s character in SLC Punk if they looked like Audrey Hepburn, that’s basically her. I’m kind of obsessed with her. Anyway…

She’s at the Buddha Belly doing laundry, a short preppy girl in a man’s Naked Raygun shirt with a RiotFest logo on the sleeve, and some bearded dude in small group of friends with his own black band shirt on tries making fun of her: “I bet that’s your boyfriend’s shirt.” Like it’s not fucking obvious since it’s huge on her.

“Yep, it is,” and she went on packing up our laundry.

“Figures. Do you even know who Naked Raygun are? They’re like one of the most important punk bands ever.”

“Yep,” she says, still barely acknowledging him.

“I mean, other than wearing your boyfriend’s shirt. Which he got at RiotFest.”

She finally looks at him. “Well, he got it from them when we gave them and their tour manager a ride to the airport when they left Chicago on their last world tour, so yeah.” Just for emphasis, because she’s a dramatic bitch when she wants to be, she added, “Pierre was such a gentleman…”

This is when his boys start snickering over their beers, and he can’t have that.

“Ohhh, okay sure. And does your boyfriend also only know them because of RiotFest?”

“Actually my boyfriend is one of the co-founders of RiotFest, so you’d have to ask him.” Snickering intensifies. “But I’m pretty sure his band played with Naked Raygun at least once before RiotFest started.” [Fact check: we actually had not played with Naked Raygun until their grand reunion at RiotFest 2006 - however it is likely she knew this and was just being a little bratty for the extra shame factor, or she was confusing a show we played with The Effigies.]

Since he has nothing to say to this and she’s all packed up and ready to go, she says on her way out, “I like your band tshirt; maybe one day you’ll start your own band and open for them.” And she leaves this doofus in perfect dramatic style, with his buddies spitting their beers all over the bar.

I come home after a 10-hour shift and the Duchess is still a bit agitated over this dickhead, and starts telling me this entire story word for word in a rapid fashion while I make my pot of coffee in silence. I sit down with a fresh cup and say, “Okay, sorry I’m ready now. So what happened while you were doing laundry?”

She gets pissed and yells, “I’ve been telling you for the past five minutes! Were you even listening?”

“Yeah I was,” I say, “it’s fucking incredible. Tell it again.” She laughs and proceeds to tell me this story a dozen times over the course of the week, and each time is such a delight.

I asked her about this recently, since it’s been a while, and she says she doesn’t even remember this guy, or this event even happening, and while it’s kinda too bad because it’s an awesome story, I think that’s actually kind of fitting. Fuck that totally forgettable gatekeeping asshole, and if you’re a gatekeeping asshole then fuck you too, you’ll never know how forgettable you are until it’s too late.",11,1756617236.0,punk,2,0.76,False

Let’s break it down with the precision of a tax auditor and the humor of a math teacher on a coffee break.

### Moneyline: The Dinos Are (Unfairly) Confident

* **NC Dinos**: +133 implied chance to win (decimal odds: 1.61). They’re the “I-aced-the-math-test” kid in class, while SSG is the one asking, “Wait, what was the question?”
* **SSG Landers**: +44.4% implied chance (decimal: 2.25). They’ll need a miracle, a rule change, or a time machine to upset the Dinos.

### Spreads: The Dinos’ “Diet Plan”

I'm embarking on an exciting journey to design a compact timber frame home and would love to get your thoughts, advice, and constructive criticism! My goal is a cozy, functional, and aesthetically pleasing timber frame house, primarily as a guest cabin/off-grid retreat, with an emphasis on outdoor living.

**Here's the concept I'm working with:**

* **Size:** The main house footprint is roughly **20 ft x 25 ft** (approx. 500 sq ft on the main level).
* **Style:** I'm committed to a **timber frame structure** – I love the rustic look of exposed beams and the inherent strength.
* **Outdoor Living is Key:**
   * **Wrap-Around Porch:** I want a **6 ft wide wrap-around porch** on all sides. This significantly expands the usable space and integrates the house with the outdoors.
   * **Corner Gazebo:** To top it off, I envision a **10 ft x 10 ft octagonal gazebo** attached to one corner of the porch (e.g., southwest corner), extending outward. This will be a perfect spot for morning coffee or evening relaxation.",7,1756617059.0,TinyHouses,2,1.0,False
1n4ma0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1n4ma0l/i_think_theres_something_wrong_with_me/,i think there’s something wrong with me,"hi very much just trying to get some stuff out of my head and maybe get some feedback bc i feel like im going crazy.

recently one of my closest friends of a decade basically ghosted me for 6 months and when i asked to get together to talk about what was going on i was told he was busy “adulting” and would get back to me when he had time for me basically. i responded saying that this was make or break our friendship and if he couldn’t make time for me i would take that as my answer and got left on read for a week before he answered. he asked if we could talk and i agreed feeling that we’d been friends for long enough to have that final chat and get some closure. he drug it
out to make it be as far out as possible and i basically had to tell him to cut it out. essentially he told me my life was too hard for him to deal with and he wasn’t emotionally mature enough to handle to negativity in my life. it was a long conversation and i tried to be as mature as possible but i was sobbing at that point. i went home and texted him to tell him i didn’t think we could be friends anymore and that my baggage came with me. 

for context my dad is disabled, constant hospital trips and emergencies, i have health issues and mental health issues and ive been in therapy for years now, along with just having a messy family life. that being said i do try to joke around and talk about other things and we spend majority of the time talking about the stuff he wants to or the stuff going on in his life so when i get to talk we usually don’t have a lot of time so i have to focus on the major stuff a lot which tends to be more on the negative side unfortunately.

that friendship ending broke me. i cried for days and i’m still not recovered and it’s gonna take me a long time to feel comfortable opening up to people now. my closest friend is really busy she works a lot more than i do which i’ve always understood and respected but recently it’s felt lil our friendship has become onesided.

i’ll text her a couple times over the course of a couple days and get no response whatsoever until she wants to text me about something unrelated. or ill try to text to make plans but she’ll barely respond to them most of the time or actually go through with them. the last couple of months her and i would talk about doing stuff and say we’re gonna do it certain days or weekends and then i have to figure out she doesn’t want to do it and then find out she decided to go on a trip instead which hurts.

the breaking point was this last weekend. i was trying to bring this up with her because i wanted to have better communication with her and asked if she was able to get together for coffee the next day and she agreed, and i told her there was something i needed to talk to her about and i felt it was important for us to go over. the morning of i get a text that her and her sister decided to take a day trip that morning instead and we need to reschedule. i was hurt so i calmly explained how i felt and why and it became an argument where she got defensive and tried to make it seem like i was asking her to choose me over her family which i would never im a million years do. it felt like no matter what i said she took it in a way that made it seem like i was asking for her to get on her knees for me when all i wanted was better communication and to let her know how i was feeling.

we had conversations about that stuff before where if there was an issue we would talk about it because we’ve had friendships implode because we expressed something and people got mad at us for it or for not saying something sooner. so idk im just really confused and hurt and we ended the conversation on what i thought were good terms and were just giving each other space but i passed a major milestone for myself yesterday and posted about it and she didn’t even like it or say anything which really hurt my feelings and i feel like this is the end of the line. she knew how hard that was for me to do and the fact that i overcame it i thought she would’ve at least congratulated me or something. maybe im just being stupid but all of this has been in the last like 3 weeks and i feel like there’s something wrong with me ",2,1756617049.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

Thank you Lofi Girl, you kept me calm and focused as I wrote all the notes.

Thank you Charlotte Dobre (and Sharklotte too)! You’ve inspired me and the real life stories of people going through stuff, have educated and entertained me so much! HUGS!

 

Although the 3 main people are masculine gay or bi men, to keep some privacy (at least for now), I’ll just call us Alladin, Jasmine and Jafar.  Foreshadowing …... ooh aah

How did I end up as Jasmine??!!  I’m slightly amused and slightly annoyed all at once by this.

 

The Backstory of these long-distance relationships: 

Jasmine (me), a tall, bearded, white Aussie and openly Bi guy living in Sydney

Jafar a closeted gay Filippino Businessman living in Manila, volunteers his time coaching and comes across as a really good man.

 

Jafar and I met online and had a lovely, committed and exclusive relationship for almost a year, communicating a lot every day.  Jafar wanted a photo of me every morning, I found this odd but went with it, perhaps it was a red flag? Was it just evidence that I wasn’t with someone else for him?

Jafar insisted on paying for everything even though I was able to pay a lot of my share.  Flights, accommodation, food, clothing, everything.  Red flag?  It was a new experience for me and I was ok with the situation, exploring the new idea, trying it on for size, at least temporarily. 

For me, money is a tool that helps increase the lives of yourself and others.  Like a hammer used to build furniture and homes.  Money, like a hammer, is not an expression of love. I just amplifies who you are.

 

Jafar also liked showing me off to his friends (who are wonderful people), in a way that made me feel more like a trophy than a partner.  It was odd.  And except for being in the condo, I was never left alone when I was in Manila.  Jafar always had his driver/security with me when I left the condo.

Jafar had a few meltdowns in our time together, accusing me of cheating for the most inane reasons, eg/ If I took too long to text him back, he would always need me to tell him everything I did to reassure him.  Definitely felt a bit monitored.  The unjustified jealousy was definitely a Red Flag and perhaps I should have left at this point but I believed it was just another hurdle to discuss and give care.  Every relationship has challenges diba? (right?).  Perhaps it wasn’t the unjustified jealousy that was the real issue, perhaps it was Jafar’s lack of personal emotional regulation, which is so important for everyone to learn how to adult in a relationship and life.

Jafar and his friends had let me know that he has experienced a prior partner cheat on him (were the friends trying to warn me?).  Jafar also said no-one had ever left him.  This seemed a bit contradictory but ok.  I reassured Jafar that I won’t cheat, in any way.  I can’t, it would mess my head up.  And there are too many stories from friends and online and movies that show the results of cheating and how it effects families, friends and partners deeply.  Life is just hard enough without creating drama.

Jafar also was embarrassed by how we met online and had dreams of moving out of the Philippines as he said he hated the country and really wanted to live in London and preferred the English accent.  This mystified me as why would Jafar look for a boyfriend in Australia at all if his goal was for England?  A bit insulting too.  And how would this be possible with his business, family and friends in the Philippines?  I decided to not overthink it, maybe they’re all just intrusive thoughts poking out.

Being with Jafar I learned that a long-distance relationship is possible and I’m so thankful to have been given the opportunity to go to the Philippines, I fell in love with the beautiful country, it’s warm, welcoming, loving people and the amazing experiences I had there.

 

End of February 2024, Jafar went on a business retreat in Bali to change his focus and work on himself towards increasing his net worth for his goals.

After this, everything changed. 

 

Here began 7 months of neglect and a real lack of communication or connection. 

I felt like an object he owned being moved from shelf to shelf and shown to others when he wanted.  My love tank gradually ran down to empty but there were still drops of hope.

One trip to Manila, I arrived at the airport and for the first time was picked up by him and not just his driver.  As he isn’t ‘out’, it was totally expected no romantic reconnection moment then, so as soon as we got in the door of his condo, I expected hugs and kisses of course.  He unloaded his stuff going about his normal day.  I had to say how about a hug and kiss to get anything.  Weird.

Even going to bed with him.  No goodnight, no kiss or hug.  I initiated as he was already set for sleep.  That trip, I cried in bed beside him due to loneliness.  Massive sign it’s long since over.  I wish I broke up then.    Love tank = dry and thirsty.

After 6 months of neglect, I finally woke up and realised all this and how we never got time to talk about daily happenings and anything else.  I realised I had been in denial for too long.

I had a big family issue occur at home, this was a wake-up call for me.  As he is a businessman, I thought I could maybe book an hour with him to be able to spend time to share life and anything going on.  Make an appointment to schedule some connection, to keep the relationship alive.  We booked it a week in advance.  I feel so dumb now, you know, 20:20 hindsight.  Who needs to book their partner in life, to spend any time.  Literally no-one with a vaguely decent relationship.  Love tank = bone dry.

We had our ‘appointment’, our 1 hour booking by WhatsApp vidcall.  This used to be a normal way we could daily connect and bridge the distance between countries.  This time he was 15 minutes late.  I didn’t worry about that as I finally was able to spend quality time with him and start to fill my love tank again.  He was tired and asked why the meeting?  I shared it’s just to connect and spend some time together for our relationship like we used to.  He ended the call quickly.  I thought it had been at least 10 minutes but on checking whatsapp call record, our 1 hour booked meeting was only 7 minutes and 50 seconds.

He avoided me one Sunday, saying it was family day and he would be spending it with them and basically had no contact with me like he used to on these days.

A mutual friend sent us a photo of him and his friends, he was so relaxed and happy.  I hadn’t seen that person in so long and cried.  Ok, fine, maybe I am a Jasmine. Definitely threw away some man cards then.

I realised that without relationship there is no relationship.  And this (maybe 18 month?) relationship had been over 7 months already, just not in name.

 

Sunday 29^(th) September 2025 – I broke up with him officially at midnight by photo of my breakup letter to him and sent a voice message reading it to him.  I asked him to give me space so I could let go and grieve properly.  No point trying to do it in person, different countries and impossible to get time with him.

Sometime over the next week or 2, he messaged me saying that he had been meaning to ask for his freedom back anyway.

Wow, that hit me hard.  I realised I was grieving over something that wasn’t even there.  It definitely helped me let go completely.

So fair enough.  Clean amicable breakup.  I deleted the WhatApp chat completely to have a clean start so I no longer have access to that.

  

It took me a while to complete the grieving process before I met anyone for relationship or intimacy.  I dated myself for a while, spending time with friends and by myself.  Much recommended, super healthy so you don’t take toxicity to a new relationship, and instead learn and grow from it so you can attract something better.  Love yourself again so others can love you.  Be the relationship you want.

 

 Tuesday 14^(th) January 2025 – I met Alladin online and had our first texts.

Alladin, an openly bi Filipino man, well supported in being out, by his family, friends and community.  Rich in love and community care and financially poor to the extreme.  Their house window is a trellis (this is important for later).  Alladin lives with his Papa, his Young Teen Neice and Younger Nephew with very little resources for food and comfort.  Very 3^(rd) world conditions.  They lost their house during a large earthquake which crushed their options and their spirits.  His mum passed away years ago of a heart attack. He and his Papa raise the kids as their mother (Alladin’s much older sister) is normally far away, working in order to support herself and the kids financially as best she can.  Alladin sometimes went without food so that the kids and his Papa could still eat and yet he never asked me for money.  He was unable to hide this from me as we spent many meals by vidcall together, and I couldn’t cope with that situation so provided Rice and simple medications to them regularly.  Still wary of potential red flags but always willing to help. 

Over a long period of time, trust was built, held and kept by both of us and by the end of February or early March 2025 we knew we were both in love and committed exclusively to each other.

 

Mid May 2025 – I never knew a relationship could be so good, so healthy, so adult, so perfect.  It’s like a Disney movie romance.  I was even thinking of marrying him already. And I’m thinking let’s just calm down and meet first, no need to rush.

I love spending time with him.  And his sweet dog is so cute trying to jump up to say hi to him while he lays on a hammock outside as we vidcall.

 

Thursday 19^(th) June 2025 – We met physically for the first time at Davao airport on the Island of Mindanao in the Philippines.

On exiting Davao Airport, non-travellers are limited to the carpark area however Alladin could not contain himself seeing me trying to orient myself as to where to go next.  He rushed to me with the biggest smile, past security and hugged me SO TIGHT saying over and over, ‘I’m not supposed to be here!’  Security didn’t seem to mind seeing me, a lost foreigner.  I’m so in love.

We spent the few days we had together exploring some of the sights and experiences of Mindanao.  I had coffee served to me black at breakfast in one place and it was the best coffee I experienced in the Philippines by a long way and the best I’ve ever had anywhere.  12/10!  They grow it there themselves.  That accommodation was so welcoming.  Great memories there.

We went walking through Davao city and just by coincidence was a Pride march going through the streets.   When they saw us walking hand in hand so openly, it seemed that all the parade marchers cheered and from then people called out ‘Sana All!’  We had people drive past us later and happy yelling ‘Sana All!’ it made us smile then and the memory will be with us for always.

I met some of his family in person, and his small and quiet, beautiful, sweet natured dog who came up to me, sniffed me and wagged her tail then went on with her normal  life.  So happy!  I got approval from his dog too.  Normally she barks a bit at strangers (not so much as the neighbour's dog - important for later). She has the cutest face too!

On my return from Davao, I changed flights at Manila Airport and went from Domestic Terminal to International terminal and through normal international security.  Remember this.

Thank you to the wonderful staff of Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines, I felt so looked after. 

On Touchdown and on the ground, us lovers reconnected by phone again, yay!

Tuesday 24^(th) June 2024 – I arrived home safe and sound.

Roughly 3 hours after I arrived home in my house in Sydney, and **9 months after I broke up with Jafar**, began the following texts to me from Jafar…

**From Tuesday to Saturday, 24th to 28th June 2025**

Screenshots from his personal phone number. Blacked out parts are our names, his WhatsApp Profile Picture and the Coaching Company name.

 You’d think this would be the end, huh.  Nope! 

I'm out of space now, I'll add updates so you can read on … and be prepared for the ride people.

Bear with me, I'm new to Reddit.

Update 1 ....

 

**Friday 4\*\*\*\*****^(th)** **July 2025**

Screenshot from random phone number 1, from the Philippines that I blocked after opening the 1 shot photo that was the only thing sent on it.

The Photo was black with text and said something like: 

“I know something about you and you’re not going to like it”                   So creepy.

 

Same day after blocking it I got a bunch of messages from random phone number 2

https://preview.redd.it/02e7sr1ekamf1.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee20df9ef8740aeaa423ad2de3f79229a785bdd

 

Also on 4^(th) July 2025 – Alladin messaged me a screenshot of a possible Instagram breach on my account as I had not opened Instagram that day at all.  The screenshot was timed at 9.11am and said I had been “Active 1h ago” but I had not been on it in the last day at all.

My partner Alladin also mentioned there had an attempt to access his Instagram 3 days prior.

 

I began to open the below messages and saved the 1 shot photos to open later

 

https://preview.redd.it/b6fv54jikamf1.png?width=335&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0f7a8d63924a80afebe0059877957272ad32751

Alladin also was told by neighbours that a woman and a man had been asking around his town where “Alladin’s Instagram handle name” lived and who he was.  Most people didn’t know Alladin by that name so couldn’t direct them.

 

Saturday 5^(th) July 2025 I met up with friends who took photos of each of the 1 shot photos sent as I opened them copied below.  Sorry for my dirty phone screen!  Embarrassing. Faces blacked.

https://preview.redd.it/dwknkhtnkamf1.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee504871acc9c7880700dbb5995cd7b977c83d6

https://preview.redd.it/fcz98cvpkamf1.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=b51866fe54d83f68e3c71c6fc46f78806a409991

https://preview.redd.it/jfozhynqkamf1.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=20e31670b74c1a5db928cd88df9af9d854768abe

Shortly after this, still on Saturday 5^(th) July 2025 - I left the venue but as I walked out I found I had received not only a missed call from Jafar (??), but also another 1 time photo, as I went back to my friends who took the photos for evidence, and a further text that read the same as the 1 time photo below.

 

https://preview.redd.it/do6ok571lamf1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=99014be9e542e6a78a7d9705dff14555094a1697

Then it began, from jealous tracking including private investigators, cyber stalking, to pure psycho, and I realised, ‘oh, I really am living a Disney movie, having finally found the most perfect love I’ve ever experienced and now, the big bad evil guy, jealous Jafar’.  WTF!  How is this even real!

 

Sunday 6^(th) July 2025 – A man arrived at Alladin’s home asking for “Alladin’s Instagram handle name” regarding his electricity bill.   Young Teen Neice talked to the man and told him there is no-one by that name here and she doesn’t know that “Alladin’s Instagram handle name”.

 

Monday 7^(th) July 2025 – Alladin went to the local Police station to report all of this.

The Filipino Police mentioned he was probably never cheated on and that he has likely done this horrifying behaviour before as it’s all occurred very organised and with speed.  They believe Jafar may have made some sort of deal with some part of the New People’s Army (NPA – look it up) through perhaps an old school friend or for someone he has done work for through his business.  The police have been investigating however Jafar has covered his tracks well so there is no evidence at this point that links him directly, so we are unable to take out even a restraining/protection order of any sort. 

While going home from reporting this to the local Police station, Alladin noticed 2 men following him, watching only.  Already at this stage it was so scary for myself and my partner.  Horrible.

A menacing female with a guy said to Young Teen Niece, ‘tell your grandfather to start saving for a coffin because one of his children is going to die’. 

Wow, they aren’t just going after Alladin now.  The bullying is affecting the whole family directly.

Withing days, Younger Nephew was chased and almost run over by a guy on a motorbike wearing something like a balaclava/facemask.  He was lucky to see just in time and got away.

Every trip to the medical clinic or police was fraught with terror, never knowing when he could be attacked or how.

 

With all the stress of this, we had multiple meltdowns and arguments, and we always apologised to each other, cared for each other, managed our emotions and responses well considering the situation and resolved all our issues quickly.  I really fell even deeper in love with Alladin due to how his emotional maturity was tested so heavily and yet he always was just more amazing for me.

The comfort room/bathroom facilities are separate from the house so he has to risk being outside every time he has to relieve himself, day or night.  Their home is on the edge of town, and the family and any visitors follow the path direct to the front door.  There is no reason for anyone to be anywhere around the house.

 

I went to the Australian Police.   When I told them that this all started 9 months after I broke up with Jafar, they outright laughed.  Jafar is ridiculous. 

The good thing is that after the police arrived at my home to discuss the issue, the mystery car on the street that had been there a few days and nights, then left.  It was there even through the cold of winter roughly 2 degrees Celsius, notably the car was on during the night, likely to keep the air conditioning working.  I’m betting a private investigator.  The Australian Police advised they have no way to assist as it’s all occurring in the Philippines at this stage.

 

Alladin attends the Police to report the threat texts from Jafar to me and also the (Instagram Handle Name – Electricity Bill incident)

 

Alladin texts “I still don’t know how I can survive from this”

 

Davao City has been rated as the second safest city in Asia.  I really felt this to be true while there.  I also found the city to be really clean.  I didn’t see any rubbish on the street at all.  The people of Davao can truly be proud of where they live.

 

Around 10.30am – returning home from the police station after doing the initial police report regarding all the texts, a motorcycle with rider followed and watched Alladin from the station to his house, then turned and rode back to where he came from.

 

Tuesday 8^(th) July 2025 –  we were scared of this situation of isolation and intimidation and attack and what prolonged fear may do to Alladin.  For a time he felt he was going crazy.

2 unknown large men were outside as well as a motorbike nearby with numberplates covered.

I reported and blocked on WhatsApp all 3 numbers with their texts.

During the day and also nightly, the house is surrounded by 1 to 3 unknown men walking around the house every few hours.  The neighbour dog who normally does not bark, would announce every time they were there.  This effects the whole family and neighbours.

So far, attacks occur only when they are certain Alladin is alone in the house.

 

Wednesday 9^(th) July 2025 – 5.10am, unknown men threw rocks on the roof.  Alladin had a panic/anxiety attack and collapsed.  Then 4.20pm they made their presence known again going around the house.

Roughly 4.45am, a man wearing a black mask threw a large rock on the roof that scared him and the kids.  Anxiety attack and he collapsed with the fear.

 

Thursday 10^(th) July 2025 – Early afternoon, alone at the house and scared in his room with people outside.

 

Friday 11^(th) July 2025 – People around the house again. Alladin was hiding, scared and shaking and focused on his breathing.

Someone threw a small plastic object, about the size of an AA battery with a timer, through the trellis window into the house.  It released a little smoke that was basically odourless.  It made Alladin feel very dizzy for a couple hours.  The police confirmed the bomb contained chemical toxins that could have possibly killed him.  Chemicals designed to restrict breathing and stop the heart. 

We later found that the contents of the bomb included Sarin, Cyanide and Carfentanil – war level chemicals.

Alladin messaged later that he had thought today was going to be his last day on earth and that what happed was the scariest thing to ever happen to him.

 

Saturday 12^(th) July 2025 – Woke in the morning full of blood due to a nosebleed and also had cold and fever symptoms today.

Early afternoon someone tried to deliver a bouquet of flowers to Alladin.  His father declined it.  They reported it to the police who very quickly found the flowers dumped nearby containing another AA battery sized bomb with a timer, resembling a stink bomb along with a note that read:  We are watching you, and we need your life as payment for betrayal.



Sunday 13^(th) July 2025 – the secret escape

Secret escape to Davao City.  Alladin saw only 1 of the thugs before arriving in the bus terminal but that man left when he went into the secured area of the terminal.

Arrived in Davao City and the hotel safely.

 

Monday 14^(th) July 2025 – in Davao City

Alladin texted:

I’m so happy even though it’s very scary.  I echoed this.  It’s amazing how we can be so happy and in love with each other and at the same time feel such great fear and foreboding.

last night I’m melting of fear and crying in the room

I can’t control my emotion and it’s slowly building trauma with what Jafar is doing

 

Tuesday 15^(th) July 2025 – in Davao City

Paranoid, scared and worried.  Alladin had been outside the hotel but had seen someone tracking him with a camera and following.  At times just crying in bed in the Hotel, so lonely and awful being stalked.  The whole time in Davao, no attacks occurred and the feeling was that it was a private investigator following him and not the thugs.  Likely due to the level of security throughout Davao city.

Caught up with a friend for dinner however they were both scared as someone was following them with a camera.  The someone even yelled out his name at one stage.

 

Wednesday 16^(th) July 2025 – Alladin arrived at the bus terminal.  Got on a bus but then moved to another bus, messaging me

“Creepy in the first bus as 4 people kept looking at me while checking their phone like they were verifying something while looking at me. So obvious and creepy.”

Alladin was on his way home and sent a pic while on the bus trip.  I knew that after he arrived at the bus terminal, it would be dangerous and he would have to hire a motorbike with rider to get home from there.   I didn’t hear from him for hours and began to have a meltdown, terrified he may be dead or attacked, injured and unable to get help.

He arrived home safe and exhausted from fear. 

I was uncertain it was even him messaging me.  I messaged him “send me a pic please so I’m really sure you’re safe my babe” prayer hands emoji.  “I’m so scared”,  “I’m shaking here my babe, please send a pic or call” 

He sent a quick pic and said he’s safe.  I broke down in tears of gratitude.

He messaged I’m safe!

Bad people seen but returned home and arrived safely, happy to see his family again.

 

Thursday 17^(th) July 2025 – 2 gunshots heard.    Alladin texted “I’m melting down at the moment.  I’m not feeling okay”

The police attended and confirmed that the shot was near their house and possibly pointed at the house.

The police later found a mango from their tree in the yard with marks from a gunshot.

On a happier note, we asked each other to MARRY via vidcall.  I’m now wearing a simple black twist-tie as a promise ring and he is wearing a white one.  So cute!  So romantic!  So perfect!  Everybody say aawwwww.  We both plan on asking again when we are in person with real rings, and when the timing is right and after asking for blessings from each other’s family and we call each other fiancé now. 😊 so happy.

I want him to be my King and he wants me to be his King.  Always and Forever.  Aw romance.

 

Friday 18^(th) July 2025 – locked in his room for some safety.  “Sad and scared” “I’m shaking at the moment”  Had to leave the house to report to police.

 

Saturday 19^(th) July 2025 – “every simple move I do, I’m scared!”

Lots of things happened in the early hours of this morning

“I need to try to sleep even if it’s scary for me at the moment” crying emoji

 

Sunday 20^(th) July 2025 – a lot of nosebleeds today

2am “I woke this night maybe 5 times already”

Someone is there watching the house while they sleep.  A few people keep walking around the house this night.

“I can manage my sleep here even when it’s scary”  
“I don’t feel safe at the moment”

“Everything is very heavy for me, I don’t know how to handle everything.”

 

Monday 21 July 2025 - possible content of the stink bomb – possibly tiny amount of sarin cyanide & carfentanil but most of it just chemical that makes someone dizzy.

Attempted to go to the clinic but couldn’t “I was quiet and scared because someone was trying to come to the house wearing a mask”  He stayed home and waited for family to return.

“My babe, I’m scared and tired” crying emojis

Gun shot today – “someone hit one shot into the roof earlier when Papa and the kids were not here”  This went into his bedroom roof”, the police indicated it could have hit him if he had been standing.

“I almost died today because the gun shot from those people, I act strong because I don’t like the people around me to get worried, especially the kids, but deeply, I AM IN PIECES RIGHT NOW!!”

“All I dream in relationship is Sincerity, Peace, Acceptance and Love.”

 

Tuesday 22^(nd) July 2025 – A third Chemical bomb today in the early afternoon.  The police attended immediately.

We both message the same to each other:

I love you always and forever my babe hearts emojis.

I love you in sickness and in health.

“I honestly need to cry”  “the doctor warns me about my condition”

Catching my breath, but fighting and surviving.

Alladin collapsed at this point and was brought to the health centre for first aid and medication.

Then he was sent home.

I had a meltdown during this as I didn’t hear from Alladin for hours.

Vomited blood again.

“I’m sorry babe I’m so weak and sick”

We both wish each other “goodnight my Fiance with hearts emojis”

 

Wenesday 23^(rd) July 2025 – Vomit a lot of blood while struggling getting inside the house

 

Thursday 24th July 2025 - Medical check with possible treatment for the Chemical Bombing

The doctor said there is a good chance he might never be able to father children now because of this.  The ultimate kick to any man’s balls from the NPA and Jafar. 

 

Sunday 27^(th) July 2025 – neighbour dog barking as a few people keep walking around the house

Alladin had issues with his Sim card.  Someone possibly hacking or copying it? As the phone said randomly “sim being removed”.  We hope we sorted this, but we have no way to know.

The fourth Chemical Bombing occurred.  This bomb was slipped through the trellis and was different.  This is the first bomb that had any scent, and it stank and made Alladin dizzy.

 

Monday 28^(th) July 2025 We both promise we will kneel and ask each other to marry with a real ring.  Love hearts

Later … Vomiting blood again and nosebleed.  I’m scared.  Lots of crying emoji.

Alladin had to risk his life leaving home to attend the doctor for further treatments so that he doesn’t die from the initial chemical bombing attacks.  His friend drove a motor bike with Alladin on the back.  I think of this friend as something of a Knight protector.  During the ride, another motor bike rider with a facemask came past and threw nails at the wheel and busted it causing them to have an accident where his friend sustained some injury to his legs.  They were able to repair the bike and reach the destinations of the doctor and back home.

When Alladin was back inside his home, the thugs threw large rocks onto his thin corrugated iron roof to intimidate.  This is Alladin’s bedroom ceiling.

This is so surreal.  Like a movie, but real, far too real.   A full war against 1 innocent man.  Jafar is a bully of the worst kind.

 

Tuesday 29^(th) July 2025 – A fifth Chemical Bomb attack but this time different.  Alladin was about to go into a zoom meeting and then the next thing he knew, he woke up and it was hours later and the bad guys had somehow invaded his house and his room and they left a syringe. Empty.  The police sent it away for testing. 

While he was knocked out, (I had a complete meltdown due to how long it was as I knew he should be available, I thought he was dead).

When the doctor got the results days later, she was saddened and not prepared to tell Alladin what it was until the initial medical treatment course for the chemical attacks had been completed.  All she did say was that he needed to be prepared for the answer and that she would help him with treatment even if it took years.

 “in trauma at the moment and my body is still shaking” I’m still scared”

 

Wednesday 30^(th) July 2025 – “My middle of the night is scary” crying emoji.  “trying to rest now because I have a very high strong fever at the moment”

 

Friday 1^(st) August 2025 – Alladin texts “I’m really tired for being in pain and scared” “I don’t know what will happen next, I’m tired fighting in the darkness”

 

Saturday 2^(nd) August 2025 – Gunshot heard.  No evidence was found however the police say it was near their house also as other people heard it.

 

Sunday 3^(rd) August 2025 – Ears are starting to bleed. The doctor believes it’s not related to the chemical bombs like the nose bleeds and vomiting, instead the doctor believes it’s due to what was in the syringe as she now knows but will not tell Alladin until he is more well as it’s apparently quite dire but she did reassure him that she will work with him for years in order to heal him as best as possible for it.  Years!  At least it’s not a death sentence at this stage but with all the other stuff going on we are so scared.

 

How are the NPA, not embarrassed being used to bully an innocent for unjustified jealousy?  Is what they are being paid is all that matters for their cause?





Update 2 ...

  
Monday 4^(th) Aug 2025 - I got a new WhatsApp message from random phone number 4.  Gee, who could it be.  Now on 24hr timer.

https://preview.redd.it/yolieooxlamf1.png?width=374&format=png&auto=webp&s=12a7762373334a647079c9575751934490882cf3

  
My thoughts about blocking him again:  what sort of a threat is this, the harm hasn’t stopped and is constantly escalating.  Oh no! He is threatening to do what he is already doing?  What??

 

Tuesday 5^(th) Aug 2025 – Alladin texts “Scary outside” and that he is not ok.

Another random gunshot.  Police again confirmed others heard it.

Later in the day a few thugs came during the day and slipped a sixth smelly battery sized bomb in the house through the trellis when only Alladin was home and were outside so he couldn’t escape.  This was another terrifying experience, then it made him dizzy and vomit more blood.  Before the bomb came through, Alladin messaged me as he was already desperately in pain from prior attacks and now hiding in his room with the thugs audibly outside his bedroom wall.

We try to laugh and share memories of life through all of this.  I feel if I don’t laugh, I’ll fully meltdown again and again and again. As it is the meltdowns are so bad when I fear Alladin could already be dead or dying or tortured or bombed further.  His doctor is also worried, angry and sad with every update.  For the past month, Alladin has been trapped in his bedroom, terrified to leave and justly so, and even there is not safe.  I truly appreciate every breath I take much more due to this long and horrifying experience for more than a month now.  Life and love are so precious.

Ear bleeds 3 days and nights in a row now.  Vomiting blood 4 times. Today additional symptoms of numbness in the back of the head and neck, jaw and arms and legs that comes and goes.  The doctor is really angry and worried as this is all symptoms matching what was in the syringe.

 

Alladin now has Nose bleeds daily.  Vomiting blood more and more often daily, up to 6 times a day now.  Constant pain, a lot of it, even though he is on very strong pain medication now.    He says it’s often 10/10 pain regardless of the meds.  Unable to sleep well.  Perhaps 30 minutes at a time due to the pain all day all night.

So many injections to counteract the initial chemical bomb attacks, one time Alladin collapsed at the medical centre. 

 

You know, it’s interesting that Jafar’s actions have really just brought Alladin and Jasmine closer together with such extreme shared emotions of terror, fear and uncertainty being punctuated by many moments of jokes, laughter, intimacy (wink) and the purest love I’ve ever known.

My partner is almost the only Filipino who cannot sing to save his life aaaaand, he sings anyway, it brings me so much joy.  Like the sounds and smells of your mum cooking in the kitchen, or random hugs from your kids, or something super special like that.

He speaks English imperfectly but confidently, always improving.  He just jumps in and does it regardless of errors and I’m so impressed.  I envy his confidence speaking multiple languages.  He is often called to be an MC, and is a leader, heavily involved in the community.  I’m so impressed by him in so many ways, and so completely in love.

1n4lya0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1n4lya0/cant_stop_revenge_fantasy/,Can’t stop revenge fantasy,"When I was younger I worked at a cafe that was loosely managed by two brothers that owned it but rarely stoped in. One of my coworkers, who was sort of like a shift lead only because he had the most coffee experience, used to fuck with me relentlessly and then apologize and grovel for my forgiveness when he took things too far. One time while I was working he stopped in and started to talk to me so I just ignored him. He kept trying to talk to me and I just wouldn’t say anything because I was fed up.  He left and came back an hour later with some guy. He told me the guy he brought was going to take over my shift and that I was fired. I don’t know why but I took him at his word and left the cafe. Now I can’t stop getting filled with rage at myself for letting him walk all over me and not sticking up for myself when he took my job.

1n4ly5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1n4ly5z/reese_brags_about_giving_money_to_a_church_and/,Reese brags about giving money to a church and brings H on camera,"Reese says she had to do a later stream today because her stepdad had to go to the emergency room and that took up most of her day. Then she spent some time with her sister's family. She's wearing a different cross necklace today. She brought her 15-year-old son on camera again and worried him by saying that Internet strangers are spending a lot of time targeting him. She also showed off another sweater she just bought, bragged about giving money to a church for the first time and discussed her Zoom calls.  
  
She reminds viewers that her monthly Zoom call is tomorrow for people who pay $25 or $50 a month. ""Come and go as you please. You don't have to be there,"" she says. A bunch of people pay for those memberships and then don't always make it to the Zoom calls. Some of those members have asked Reese if they can gift their Zoom call to someone else in Reese's chat who can't afford it. Reese said once that she would make that work, but I don't think she has ever followed through on that because every month there are members who tell Reese why they couldn't be on the call while there are other longtime fans in Reese's chat who feel sad and left out that they can't afford to attend.   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter sends a normal message saying that she prayed for Reese with her prayer group and told people there how proud she was of Reese's growing faith. ""That is beautiful. ... You really mean a lot to me. ... Please thank your group,"" Reese replies. If that Bible superchatter actually meant a lot to her, Reese would invite Abigayle to be part of the monthly Zoom calls.   
  
Another Redditor says that Abigayle wrote in Reese's chat that she can't afford to be in the Relatable Reese Zoom calls. I feel so sad for Abigayle because she has spent thousands of dollars on special gifts, channel memberships and superchats for Reese. She could have spent some of that money to be in the Zoom calls or even spent $100 a pop for a few phone calls with Reese, but I think Abigayle is convinced that she's ministering to Reese and to Reese's chat. It's disgusting how Reese is taking advantage of that.  
  
Reese bought yet another sweater at Southern Goods Mercantile today. That's the boutique she streams from sometimes where she recently pushed people to buy horse sweaters. Reese bought at least two horse sweaters for herself and now she also has a sweater with bunnies on it. When a fan asks how much it costs, Reese says ""I want to say $45."" She says if the boutique gets it in another color like navy, she'll buy that one too.   
  
People who are giving Reese money are just fueling her shopping addiction at this point IMO. If Reese were actually worried about saving money for another move, she wouldn't have bought any new clothes or jewelry, but she has continued to buy a lot of new stuff recently. Reese is extremely careless with money and many fans are enabling her.   
  
Reese tries the bunny sweater on and raves about it. She says she should work for a shopping network and insists again that she doesn't get kickbacks from Southern Goods, but that's not true because she has admitted in the past that the store gives her deep discounts and a lot of free stuff. Those are kickbacks. I wouldn't be surprised if Reese also gets a percentage of sales made by her fans and she's just lying that she doesn't.   
  
She jokes that God wants her to have this sweater and that Anna Wintour wants her to take over as editor of Vogue. Today she also bought the cross necklace she's wearing tonight. ""I had to,"" she says. ""... I like the cross stuff now. I feel proud wearing a cross. ... There's something about wearing a cross that makes me feel really special."" Reese still hasn't started reading the Bible and she doesn't know what the teachings of Jesus are. She should learn more before shooting her mouth off about wanting to be Christ-like.   
  
Reese often claims that she doesn't watch TV and she doesn't know pop culture, but she just threw out a reference to Laverne & Shirley.  
  
She says she drove by a horse today that was dying and then she drove by again later and it had a tarp over it. That broke her, she says. Reese is constantly trying to find new ways to pull on the heartstrings of her fans who love animals. Then she adds that she asked God to welcome the horse into heaven, so she's pandering more to her Christian fans. ""I felt like God was saying 'Girl, get that sweater,'"" she says. ""... He convinced me.""   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter spends $20 to send a verse regarding the horse. It's the famous verse that says for everything there is a time to be born and a time to die. ""That makes me feel much better about it,"" Reese tells Abigayle. ""... I talk to God all the time now. I talk to God like he's a friend of mine."" If Reese went to 100 funerals in Kansas City like she claims she did, I'm sure she's heard that verse before as well as teachings about Jesus many times.   
  
She can't believe the prices at Southern Goods are so low, Reese says, adding that she feels like she's in Anthropologie when she shops there. She says she can't afford Anthropologie stuff but then throws in that Anthropologie has a 40 percent off sale all weekend.   
  
Reese claims Ellie gave her a discount on her new cross necklace. That's yet another kickback, Reese. She says she told Ellie that she wanted to buy it as a gift for herself because she wants to be loud and proud about her new belief in Jesus.   
  
Reese says she was having a conversation with a friend this morning and then she gets sidetracked. She starts complaining about H telling her he needs more tuna. ""He goes through so much tuna. He eats so much protein because he's weight-lifting,"" she says. Reese knows when she starts talking about how expensive it is to feed H, some fans will send her money even though she has just bought new stuff she doesn't need and she makes a lot of money from her channel already.  
  
She went to Dollar General to buy tuna and says she met a man with a table there who was talking about a ministry he helps. ""I've never given money to a church except a Church of Scientology. They got a lot of my money,"" Reese says.   
  
She describes how she felt inspired to give that ministry money so she went back outside and asked the man if he accepted donations for his ministry. She says she gave him some money, he gave her a receipt and she told him that she had never given money to a church before and that she just started believing in Jesus a few days ago. Reese says the guy looked thrilled. ""Welcome to the family,"" she says he told her. She started crying when he said that, she says. 

Reese says she has never given money to a church before, but when H asked her to take him to church last year, the night before they went to the service, Reese called out to him and told him to make sure he had money to give to the church.  
  
Reese claims she knows God and she's learned all about Jesus when she actually knows very little about Jesus. Reese is getting more praise from additional Christians in her chat. They're saying amen and telling her to shine that new light. If this trend keeps up, I think a lot of Reese's current fans who aren't Christians are going to start feeling awkward in Reese's chat.   
  
A fan who came to Reese's Nashville meet-up says what Tommy and Johnny Scoville are doing at a drug rehab in Ecuador is inspiring. Reese agrees and claims she knows that Tommy and Johnny have given a lot of money to a treatment center there.   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter spends another $20 to send a verse telling Reese to let the Holy Spirit renew her thoughts and attitudes. Many people have reached out to her since Wednesday's stream to tell her she looks different, she says. ""I feel different,"" she says. ""I know I'm on the right path now."" When she got in trouble for talking about God when she was a Scientologist, she stopped talking about it, she says.   
  
She's finishing her expensive Outshine the Fox tattoo on Thursday, she says.

She says that Scientologists are trained to take abuse and that she still puts up with people pushing her boundaries way more than she should. Reese finally goes back to talking about the call she had with a friend this morning. She emphasizes how much she hates it when people try to tell her things she should or shouldn't do. ""I don't need to be saved. I need to be taught some things,"" Reese says.   
  
She doesn't love the romantic relationship this friend is in and she feels like her friend keeps saying things to try to get Reese to change her opinion of the relationship. Reese did that so much herself when she was in a relationship with Tommy, so she has no room to talk about this.   
  
Reese says her friend was telling her that the relationship is a lot better now. ""But there were too many red flags in the beginning of the relationship for me to feel cool with it,"" Reese says, adding that she told her friend today that it's her relationship and Reese doesn't have keys to her house so her friend doesn't have to try to sell her on the relationship. I'm wondering if these phone calls are among the calls that Reese charges people $100 to have with her.   
  
A chatter says they're interested in Reese's Zoom calls but they're concerned because they've heard that there are plants in those calls. Reese says her critics are obsessed with her and they will always try to cause trouble for her. ""You trust your judgment on that,"" she says, adding that she doesn't think there are moles in her Zoom calls because she has said very personal things on those calls for months. She has told those callers that she's telling them things she would never share on YouTube and if something leaks, she'll just have to explain it.   
  
Reese wrongfully claims that her critics just make stuff up about her. Many of her former mods and people who used to be close to her have spoken out and have shown damning texts and receipts proving that Reese has lied about a lot of things.  
  
Reese also contradicts herself because when fans get upset that they're missing out on things because they can't afford the Zoom calls, Reese tells them the Zoom calls are just like her YouTube shows except she can see people's faces on the Zoom calls. That's clearly not true. She's sharing a lot of private information on those calls. She has apologized before for spending a lot of time during those calls dumping her own problems onto people who pay to be there.   
  
She holds up a meme that she posted in her Facebook group. ""Stop letting people who are going to hell bother you,"" it says. Reese says there are some things that are just evil and she knows won't be allowed in heaven, so she's going back on what she said the other night about not being able to judge who's going to hell.   
  
Reese claims she hasn't been on Reddit in over a year and that she has people who check those subreddits and show her things they think she needs to see. Getting screenshots and reports about Reddit isn't the same as being sober from Reddit, Reese.   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter spends another $10 to send a verse about not condemning other people.   
  
Reese claims she and her chat don't pick on anyone. That's just not true. Reese encouraged her fans to stalk Jeff on social media last year, she and her chat doxxed a Jester prostitute who was arrested last year, plus she and some fans have tried to destroy some of her ex-mods and former friends. After the Jester prostitute was doxxed last year, some people in Reese's chat got so carried away that a mod had to tell people not to contact the woman's family. Reese has never properly apologized for any of that.   
  
Reese says if people rattle her cage, she's ready to rumble. ""Once is a mistake. Twice is a decision,"" she says about doing bad things. Her Bible superchatter spends another $5 to send a verse saying the Lord protects all who love him but he destroys the wicked.

Reese says she won't be mean but she will absolutely destroy people who come after her or H. I don't know of anyone who has ever tried to go after H. Almost everyone is fiercely protective of H, but Reese does have a Zoom caller who seems way too interested in her 15-year-old son.   
  
When real bad-ass people are coming for you, you'll never see them coming, Reese says. Behavior is the truth, she says. Reese really loves to talk in motivational soundbites that she has stolen from other people.   
  
She calls for H and then gets frustrated when he doesn't answer. She mutes the stream twice to yell for him. He comes in to drop off the birthday gift that Reese's sister gave her today. Reese says she hasn't seen her sister until now. That's telling because they don't live that far from each other and Reese's birthday is in early July.   
  
H comes back on camera to say hello to fans and Reese asks what he's wearing around his neck. ""It's that cross,"" he says. I think he's referring to a special cross that one of Reese's fans sent H for his birthday. Reese asks her fans to look at H's arms and says he's been lifting weights. Reese shouldn't be encouraging Internet strangers to look at her kid's body, especially since she has shared that H is struggling with body image issues and is comparing himself to grown men.   
  
She says H's voice sounds like Tom Selleck from Blue Bloods. Again, I thought Reese doesn't watch TV or have any idea about pop culture.   
  
H says he's been busy working on his grandparents' ranch and doing homework. She prompts him to talk about what he did last night and he can't remember what she's talking about. ""You went to a football game!"" she says. H says it was a big rivalry game. ""I actually left the house,"" he says with a big grin on his face.   
  
His favorite class is business and marketing. Reese questions whether that class is really his favorite so he mentions math. ""What? You talk about agriculture a lot,"" she says.   
  
The other team won the football game, he says. H didn't name either school but then says everybody probably knows where he goes to school anyway. I feel so bad for H that Reese ever put her son on the radar of Internet strangers. Reese tells him he doesn't have to make it easy for haters to find him even though they dig for private information. ""Because they're unemployed,"" H says. Reese laughs and says he's definitely her son. Reese says they have enough time to call H's school. Anybody who is doing that is going way too far IMO.   
  
Reese then puts it in H's head that a bunch of people are spending a ton of time digging for personal information about him, not her. She has already caused her son so much worry, trauma and heartache. She got him disconnected from his Scientologist grandparents and extended family he used to visit every year. She made him feel like he had to protect her from abusive relationships and yelling fights with men. She let him hear her say multiple times that a man he saw as a father figure was coming to kill her. Now she's worrying him that a lot of people he doesn't know are trying to cause problems for him. That is absolutely gross.   
  
Reese tells H he probably makes more money than some of her critics. He asks if there are a lot of people watching and she replies that about 220 people are watching. He says he should come in sometime and talk to her chat. He's just been standing in the doorway.   
  
A chatter says she's unemployed and she's not a hater. Reese says there's nothing wrong with being unemployed but she's talking about people who are calling H's school and Child Protective Services. It makes my heart hurt that H had to worry that his mom might be arrested for taking Jeff's guns or that CPS might take him away from his mom.  
  
H leaves the stream and Reese's Bible superchatter spends another $10 to send a verse saying that fools think their own way is right but the wise listen to others.   
  
Reese asks if anybody has a favorite serial killer. She says she loves Ed Kemper, the Co-Ed Killer. He used to pull up to girls in a car and ask them if they needed a ride. Forensics and cameras are making it harder and harder to get into serial killing, she says. She holds up a mug that her sister gave her for her birthday. It has Ed Kemper's face on it and the words ""Need a ride?"" Reese says she's really into it and she'll be drinking her coffee from it every morning. ""I realize it's a little dark and it may be too dark for some of you, but my sister's dark,"" she says.   
  
Reese calls Ed Kemper her boyfriend and says how cute he is. She starts rubbing the mug over her body and then she kisses it. Reese says she has problems and she should probably get another therapist. Other chatters bring up BTK. Reese says BTK was absolutely terrifying and he lived about three hours away from her. Someone else mentions John Wayne Gacy and Reese says she was very freaked out by Jeffrey Dahmer. The Zodiac Killer fascinated her, she says.   
  
A woman who came to the Nashville meet-up gifts 10 memberships to Reese's channel. Reese's Bible superchatter spends another $5 to send a verse that says if people confess their sins, God is faithful and just to forgive them.   
  
Reese says she loved Dexter and throws in that now she knows the Ten Commandments and they say you're not supposed to kill people. She wishes there would be a show like Dexter except he only kills people who harm and torture animals. Reese makes a point of saying she donates money to animal rescues.   
  
Kevin Spacey rocked her world as an actor but not as a person, she says. Reese starts talking about a bunch of other actors and movies.

She starts reading the lyrics to Man of the Hour by Pearl Jam. That's the song she chose for Fred's funeral, she says.   
  
Reese asks people to subscribe to her channel and hit the like button on this stream. She claims she doesn't know how to hit the like button herself and that someone showed her the other day.   
  
She's going to try to keep her Zoom calls to eight hours, she says, because they were getting so long that some people were taking the next day off work.   
  
Reese thanks her Bible superchatter for all of her Scriptures and says they're spot-on. Abigayle then spends another $20 before the stream ends to send a verse about God's word being a light. ""I've got to read the Bible,"" Reese says. Talk is cheap, Reese.",2,1756615895.0,OT42,1,1.0,False

- Patients with melanoma or non‑small cell lung cancer receiving anti‑PD1 therapy who reported frequent intake of sucralose‑containing products, such as diet sodas and sugar‑free coffee, showed lower response rates and shorter survival compared with low‑consumption peers.
- Mouse studies revealed that sucralose altered gut microbes that metabolize arginine, leading to depleted arginine levels in blood, tumors, and stool, which impaired T‑cell activity essential for checkpoint inhibition.
- Providing sucralose‑fed mice with supplemental arginine or its precursor citrulline restored arginine concentrations, rescued T‑cell function, and returned anti‑PD1 treatment efficacy to control levels.
- Observational data from 132 patients confirmed a correlation between higher sucralose intake and poorer therapeutic outcomes across cancer types, stages, and treatment regimens.
- The investigators plan a clinical trial to evaluate citrulline supplementation as a countermeasure and intend to study other non‑nutritive sweeteners for similar effects.

Why it matters: dietary choices like consuming diet soda could influence the success of life‑saving cancer immunotherapies.

1n4ls0d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4ls0d,"A Comparison of 1977 vs 2008 US Food Packet Survival, General Purpose","Hi folks,

Taking a look at 2 Food Packet, Survival, General Purpose rations from very different time periods, 1977 and 2008. Many thanks to Mike Kreisher for both of these amazing experiences!!! 1977 makes this the oldest ration I have consumed now by 1 year.

The most amazing thing is these are still being produced by the same company! The biggest difference is the newer one is packaged in cardboard instead of the elegant and durable tin!

Let's get into it!

We will start with the 1977 ration. 

Pics 1-5 show the packaging and contents. Ring worked exactly as intended and there was a very noticeable HISS upon opening! There were no bad smells inside the tin at all, odorless essentially.

Pics 6-7 show the soup base both before and after reconstitution. It was a bit clumped but smelled great. Made with 8 oz of hot water. This soup was great, had a wonderful savory/salty, chicken flavor, and held up much better than the 2008 version for sure. 100% consumed!

Pic 8 shows one of the bars. You get 3, 1 of one type and 2 of another. We will see better variety in the newer one for sure! The bars tasted fine and all 3 were consumed 100%. They did not taste that different to be honest. Slightly sweet, dry, and sort of cornflake flavored. I will say they had a sort of ""odd"" mouthfeel that is difficult to describe but not off-putting in any way.

Pic 9 is the coffee. I did use the sugar. This tasted perfectly fine. Was not the best coffee I've had from a ration but not the worst either. I did add a non-dairy creamer after trying with just the sugar and that did improve it even more. The more I drank the more I liked it.

Pic 10 shows the chocolate fudge bar. This thing was totally rancid. Once you experience that rancid smell, you can very easily detect it again. Straight to the garbage.

On to the 2008 version! No bad smells coming from this one upon opening and there was, unfortunately,  no hiss when the cardboard box was opened 😉.

Pics 11-13 show the packaging and contents. Quite different than the 1977 version with a couple similar items for sure. 

Pic 14 shows the Charms. These were a soft, gooey, melted mess. I did manage  to get a red and green one opened and took a nibble of each. They tasted just fine. After that I had to scrub my hands because they were a sticky mess. These actually leaked a little in the box as well, that's how melted they became. 

Pic 15-16 show the chicken broth. Trust me, the camera does not do this justice. This stuff was black and did not smell ideal. I did make it and try it, 4 MRE spoonfuls only, and that was enough to send the rest right down the drain. It didn't taste so bad to make me spit it out, but the 77 version was so far superior to this it's not even close. Weird how the older one held up so much better (maybe the vacuum?).

Pics 17-19 show several of the bars, Shortbread (you get 2 of these), Chocolate Chip Dessert Bar (1 of these), and a Granola Bar (1 of these). You also get a Cornflake bar, but I'm eating that one for breakfast tomorrow!). The Shortbread bar was great! All the flavor notes of true Shortbread, no rancidity at all, 100% consumed. The granola bar was good, but there were notes of racidity in this one; perhaps the coconut fats went off a bit. Ate the whole thing anyway. Now, let's talk about the real star of both of these rations, the Chocolate Chip Dessert Bar! Folks, this has absolutely no business being this frigging good. I actually put this in my front pocket and took it on a bike ride to meet my wife for lunch. During the trip,  the chocolate chips inside melted and turned this bar into a whimsical gooey melted chocolate treat. It was so good I even had my wife try a bite, and she thought it was great too. I absolutely love it when these experiences offer something totally unexpected,  and my adoration for this bar is just that....how could it be so good?

No pics of the tea, but it was made and drank 100%. A wonderful lemony sweet tea!

So, which did I like better? I think the 2008 version was the winner in that regard even with the rancid soup base. 

Another wonderful experience and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have tried them both!!! Do they have a 2025 version?

1n4lqxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1n4lqxe/10_takeaways_as_a_reader_for_the_austin_film_fest/,10 Takeaways As A Reader For The Austin Film Fest 2025,"Well well well, another year, another few hundred scripts read for the Austin Film Fest. Last year’s post seemed popular enough to warrant another go at it, so I’ve compiled a few more thoughts on this year’s entrants.

1. **Put yourself In the shoes of the audience**
   1. It’s been said before to write the movie/show you would want to see, and there’s a lot of truth to that, but don’t forget that, ideally, people who are *not us* are going to watch this someday. I’m not talking about trying to generalize for the lowest common denominator, which I think has been an ongoing Hollywood issue, I’m talking about closing your eyes, imagining *you* are a person who just saw what you wrote, and telling their friend about it. If they’re excited about what they saw, why? How would they describe it? Can they easily explain the premise without thinking about it too much? Are there moments that will make them excitedly say “what the fuck??” out loud in the theater? Will people be leaning back in tension during a scary moment and letting out a huge, stress-relieving scream when the scare happens? Do they need a little nudge to help them understand the plot? I personally get very excited while watching my own work through the audience’s eyes, it helps make writing feel more active and less like I’m just getting through the required pages. 
2. **Transitions make a huge difference.** 
   1. It’s something not talked about enough when discussing writing “craft,” though Craig Mazin has mentioned it on his Scriptnotes podcast. It’s incredible how many scenes I would read that just end with no notice, we’re simply not in that scene anymore. Transitions help us know what and how to feel from scene to scene, and they don’t always have to be a big moment or anything, but even just noting a look from a character, a question, or an action, can make a big difference. Often scenes or sequences would end on a line that seemed kinda innocuous, something that didn’t leave me feeling anything in particular. If we were watching this, it’s just like the editor decided “we’re done here” and the next scene would begin. Similarly to the previous note, really close your eyes and watch your movie, did the scene really cut away the moment someone said their line, or was there an extra beat of the other character reacting? It’s one of the reasons why folks will recommend reading novels from time to time, because novelists know they need to end their chapters in a way that clearly feels like we’re wrapping up a moment before moving us on to the next chapter. Speaking of which…
3. **Act breaks mean something.** 
   1. I read a lot of pilots that included act breaks, mostly 5 acts, some only 3. Those act breaks you’re including in the headers aren’t just there as decoration and they aren’t there as some sort of symbolic formality. In fact, the act break heading isn’t the thing that should define an act break at all, t*he action within the script should do that on its own.* If you removed the act break headers altogether, a reader should still feel them, meaning what’s happening in your story should define an act break, not a page number. So many pilots this year had act breaks that were simply there because “this is roughly the page where an act break should go,” but there wasn’t any evidence within the story that we were breaking from one act to another. You can borrow and re-use whatever structure you’d like, but an act break needs to be defined by something we can feel, a change, a decision, a betrayal, a discovery, SOMETHING. This goes with features as well, of course, but typically writers weren’t including act break headers within their features. 
4. **Prove your plot to the reader**
   1. If your character is upset with their love life, feeling lonely, etc., and desperately wants a change, they can’t also be turning down dates left and right. If your character is a standup comedian and they’re hoping they’ll win a standup competition, they need to be incredibly funny. If your character is a detective, and they’re the best at what they do, we need to see them do some mighty fine detective work. There were several scripts this year that basically presented a world with no evidence, or loose evidence at best. It would be like saying your character is the best speller in the world, and their example is that they can spell “irregular.” This kinda extends to the “show, don’t tell” rule, where the worst examples are someone telling us something about the character but not actually showing us anything to prove that. It would be as if GOOD WILL HUNTING had people telling Will he's a genius and never letting us see him writing those iconic equations.
5. **Your characters don’t have to be “likeable,” but they do have to be** ***interesting.***
   1. I think most would agree that “make your character more likeable” is an awful note. Your character can be a good person and do good things, but that’s not necessarily what makes a good character. You can have a character who hates everyone, a complete misanthrope, someone who would rather kick a cat than to save it, but if you make them *interesting,* you’re on the right track. I read a script where someone hated their family and constantly made fun of them, but they were stuck on a vacation with them. They were cruel, unfunny, over dramatic, and whiny, *and if they were interesting that would all be forgiven*. But they weren’t, they brought nothing to the plot with them, never changed, they weren’t hiding anything, there was nothing bigger under the surface, they weren’t even particularly good at anything, yet somehow they were the center of attention during every scene and someone else fell in love with them immediately, *and I had no idea why.* In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, you’ve got an OCD-laden, misanthropic, bigoted sexist, and he hates dogs. Not very ""likeable"" at all. But you know what he is? *Interesting.* He’s an incredibly talented writer, there’s some deep hurt underneath him, and he’s willing to go to extreme lengths just to keep what he considers “normal” in his life. Another character I read was the favorite cowboy in town. He helped everyone, looked up to by all, he was the best shot (we only know that because another character told him that), *and he was unbelievably boring.* We never got to see how he made decisions, what he struggled with, or if he was particularly good at anything other than pleasantries. Likeable as it gets, not interesting in the least. If you’re at a complete loss at how you can make someone more interesting, just make them very good at something, and then take that thing away. At minimum you’ve got someone who stands out and now needs to relearn how to do what made them interesting in the first place.
6. **Context goes a long way.**
   1. There were a number of scripts this year where a protagonist was going through a major life change, like the death of a parent, a divorce, or maybe being contacted by aliens. Great! Throwing a life-altering wrench at your protagonist is an awesome way to tell a story. The problem is these things all happened before the story began, and without any sort of understanding about who a protagonist was before these extreme events, it’s hard to tell how things have changed for them. MARRIAGE STORY starts in the middle of their divorce, but we're given an incredibly useful ""what I love about \_\_\_\_"" scene that shows everything we need to know about what's at stake with their relationship. Lots of rom-coms take the short cut of “hard working protagonist comes home to find someone fucking their spouse in the first 3 minutes,” which is obviously overdone, but it comes from a place of understanding that it helps to glimpse what “normal” looked like for their characters before the meat of the story really begins. It’s not a hard and fast rule by any means, but it does require a bit of nuance when determining when and how to pull the rug out from the audience. Speaking of which…
7. **Don’t hide the wrong thing.** 
   1. This is going to sound pretty specific, but I wouldn’t bring it up if it didn’t come up in more than one script. Imagine if the pilot for the show GHOSTS withheld any sense that the people Samantha is seeing are ghosts, and we’re left to wonder who the fuck all these people are? Or if it withheld that she had her accident in the first place, but there are just ghosts around. It would make for a confusing watch. Yes, we could consider watching the next episode to get some answers, but these aren’t the answers we should be asking for. Take a pilot like LOST, which is a show all about asking questions and teasing out answers (whether you liked the conclusion or not). They knew what to present to you in order for you to watch the next episode. *But let’s pretend they hid the wrong thing*; what if they withheld that the characters were on a plane at all, and instead we just picked up with them navigating the island with no mention of how they got there? The audience would feel something was missing, like the filmmakers forgot to tell us a crucial part of the joke for the punchline to make any sense. This is what I read in more than one script. There was a mystery here, but it was the wrong mystery. 
8. **Don’t blow your best setups on the pilot.**
   1. So many pilots this year had the potential for some really good set ups that could be paid off mid season or later, like a wife meeting with a divorce lawyer but having second thoughts and a husband secretly taking a mortgage out on their house but backing down at the last minute. By the end of the pilot, this information is revealed and dealt with, water under the bridge, and the plot will moved on like nothing ever happened. It’s such a waste of a set up that could make for some incredible drama down the line, and may very well be the secret weapon you need to keep your series going. If your sci-fi character has a robotic arm and doesn’t talk about it, you really don’t need to answer that in the first episode, that can be a big character moment for them that you can build toward. Imagine if Jaimie Lannister had a heart-to-heart with Ned Stark at the end of the GOT pilot about the truth behind his assassination of the Mad King. Sure, that’s interesting stuff, but instead we get an insane amount of character development from Jaimie through 3 seasons until he’s at his lowest before he reveals his feelings to Brianne. Don’t waste a setup like that. 
9. **Why now?** 
   1. Your plot can’t begin simply because the protagonist decided it should (I read a script that included the protagonist saying “Or maybe… it’s time I make a change?” in the first page), it should be something that happens organically, even better if your protagonist is at odds with it, that way they can choose to become a part of the plot themselves. If you really want to write a series about a young person working in a retirement home, and your pilot is their first day, it shouldn’t be just because they woke up that day and said “you know what? I’m going to work in a retirement home.” There needs to be something that brought them there. Do they have a grandparent who doesn’t remember them, and this is how they get to keep an eye on them? Is this court mandated? Maybe a way to get closer to someone they have a crush on who works there? There's a million ways this could go, as long as the reason why it's happening WHEN it's happening in the script feels like something we can sink our teeth into.
10. **Things just happen.**
   1. Recognizing this early will go a long way for scenes that would benefit from some added tension or drama (it works for comedy as well, but we'll get there). Often in these scripts, a character would be put into a situation where they would need to perform an action (rob a house, fix a car, steal a book from a library, feed their friend's fish, whatever) and they would simply... do it. Things would just happen, and then they would be done. Not every scene needs to be a complicated set piece, of course -- your protagonist ordering a coffee doesn't need to be a whole thing (though what/how they order can say something about them, as long as it's not yet another 40+ man ordering a black coffee from a Gen Z-er who has no idea what they're talking about) -- but you don't want to miss an opportunity to really earn the ticket we're potentially paying to see your work. If Character A breaks into Character B's house to steal the Macguffin, and later on Character B finds out they were there, that's an example of ""things just happen."" Character A set out to do a thing, they did it without much hassle, and later Character B learned about it. Fine, that is undeniably plot. But if you're writing a thriller, you have a chance to take advantage of the genre you're writing in. Character A can break into Character B's house, and right when they find the Macguffin Character B can come home early, BUT set Character A in a part of the house where they have no idea Character B is home, and don't let Character B find any evidence that anyone's in their house at all. THEN you've got the audience in the palm of your hand, because they're the only people here who know that both of those characters are in the same house at the same time. You can then tighten that screw to your heart's content, letting those two characters get closer and closer to discovering each other, before you finally release us and allow Character A to escape.
   2. So what about for comedy? Say your protagonist has a big date, but they get diarrhea in the middle of it (we all remember ALONG CAME POLLY, I'm sure) and needs to leave. That's a scene where things just happen. Yeah you shook things up a little, and it's humorous, but this can be taken further. Remember that writing is often about challenging your characters and giving them a chance to show who they are through how they face (or don't face) a challenge. So what can we do here? We can start by giving the protagonist diarrhea BEFORE they've arrived to the date, so we already have that bomb ticking by the time the scene starts. Now every move they make, every word spoken, is going to come with the added stakes that they might shit themselves. But we're not done, because this is about challenging your characters, and a big thing that can help define your characters is to be specific. So you make them a medical professional, maybe a nurse in training, or an EMT, and their date knows that. You give this medical professional diarrhea before they get to the date, watch them sweat as they desperately attempt to get through it... and then have the person at the table next to them start choking. *Now you've got a medical professional on an important date, desperately trying not to shit themselves, and suddenly they have to choose whether or not to give the Heimlich maneuver to the person next to them because if they do they will absolutely shit themselves.* This is how you take advantage of your genre and ensure that things aren't ""just happening.""

**Honorable mentions:**

\- Read your script OUT LOUD to catch mistakes.

\- ""We see/hear"" is perfectly fine. If it's good enough for David Koepp, it's good enough for you.

\- The viewer can't read your script, don't depend on action lines to describe what can't be seen.

\- You might not be able to describe a thought, but you can describe a reaction. *""What the hell?""* in italics, for example.

\- Speaking of which, generally, if it helps tell your story without breaking screenwriting logic, go for it.

\- Spacial awareness within a scene is very important. Where are characters in relation to each other? Who's there at the top of the scene?

\- Don't get caught up in prose. Describing exactly how the sun is feeling on the skin of your protagonist should be rare.

\- Unless it defines their character, or is important to the scene, leave the wardrobe descriptions out, these get exhausting to read.

\- Keep the parentheticals of a character intro brief, and generally stick to what we're seeing or feeling about a character. ""She is the most popular girl in school but deep down she feels a little shy, especially since her dad left her mom and everyone knows"" is a no-no.

\- Be smart about what's possible to film/animate. ""His skin is also paper but doesn't reflect light"" is already too difficult to imagine.

\- Don't get too caught up on hyper-specific physical descriptions of actions. For example, ""she leans on her left arm with her elbow on the table and rests her head in her palm while she holds the phone with her right hand against her ear as she listens..."" is way too much. Leave that for directing.

\- Unless this is your shooting script and you're going over it with your DP, please leave specific shot choices out unless it's really important. Occasionally mentioning something like ""CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN NOTE"" or ""EXTREMELY EXAGGERATED DUTCH ANGLE"" is fine if it helps tell the story, otherwise save it for your storyboards.

**BONUS (I'll keep updating this as more comments/observations come in):**

\- I genuinely believe that every writer should work as a reader once in their life. You might never want to read a script ever again, but it will be an invaluable tool to give you insight into how others are writing, what mistakes they're making, and what separates a script you enjoy from one you don't. Not everything that makes a good script good or a bad script bad are very obvious, so this is incredible practice for recognizing what's working so it becomes second-nature.

\- I read 4 scripts this year where an inheritance came with an ultimatum. Not sure what to take from that, but clearly there's something in the air about that as a topic.

\- There were a LOT of scripts that reference TikTok, influencer culture, Gen Z slang, etc. There's nothing inherently wrong with this at all, and if that's the culture you can confidently write about then go ahead. Keep in mind that your script *will* be dated within a year or two. What seems topical at the time of writing it could be far in the rear view mirror culturally by the time something is produced, so just be aware of how quickly times change and don't get hung up in trying to chase something that seems relevant now.",13,1756615207.0,Filmmakers,1,1.0,False

However, one of my favorite ice creams is just plain chocolate and realized I'm missing that one. What I mean by specifically ""premium"" is that there seems to be a difference between the average chocolate ice cream, and premium chocolate ice cream

Here are 2 examples of specific brands that pretty much nail it:

* [Aldi's chocolate super premium ice cream](https://www.aldi.us/product/specially-selected-chocolate-premium-ice-cream-48-fl-oz-0000000000002139) (brand Specially Selected)
* [BJ's Wholesale Club premium chocolate flavored ice cream](https://www.bjs.com/product/wellsley-farms-premium-chocolate-ice-cream-64-oz/3000000000002443751/) (brand Wellsley Farms)

What I'm mainly wondering is has anyone been able to or have good ideas on how to nail this flavor? Hopefully someone knows what I mean by ""premium chocolate"" since I'm not good at describing flavors, but it's not super rich and maybe closer to milk, and it's not watery or bland. If it helps, I don't typically like chocolate protein shakes, those just taste like cold hot chocolate which is different flavor than this (to me)

I'm not sure if the flavor I'm looking for could only come from normal unhealthy ice cream (due to sugars/fats0, or if it would be possible to try to mimic this flavor in a lower calorie protein creami (so using protein powder, not sure which brand for chocolate or if chocolate flavor would come from a different ingredient)

Anyone have recommendations or is this not really doable? Sorry if this is a brainlessly dumb question but I honestly have no idea but would love a chocolate base I like

Edit: Figured I'd mention, would [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1myqspk/finally_perfected_my_chocolate_protein_creami/) quality for this flavor?

Keeps suggesting I sleep with other women and have a girlfriend.,"This is really long so if you like quickies I suggest you move on! Let me (39m) begin by saying my wife (37f) became the love of my life (or so I thought) rather quickly after a very selfless action. At the time I was a single dad to a 9 yr old son. His mother had passed after we divorced however I’ve always had custody of him. 


Throughout the insanity and chaos of my 20’s i felt no purpose no real cares. I was able to feel pure purpose in being a dad. Well, I end up raising my son with the help of my parents and his mom’s dad and step mom since I worked at nights and life isn’t perfect, not much success in the beginning financially. But we were happy. As we grew, me as a dad and him as a boy we had our own little batchelor pad. It was cool. Was it the best and most perfect thing in the world? Far from it. I had a few kicks in the ass and decided to go into a new career into something that once experience was gained in could become a very nice career with nice financial gains. 


Well after some ups and downs I end up employed in the field of the career I was entering. I devoted myself to it ( my career) as I wasn’t really trying for relationships at the time just had some “friends”. I quickly found a place and a niche in my new career and began a journey that while it had its bumps and bruises and more than my fair share of running my head into a wall, became extremely rewarding. About that time I decided that I was ready to really really apply myself and see if there were any serious candidates in the dating game and I ended up online dating.  


That’s when I saw a gal I recognized from high school who I had a crush on but she had a boyfriend who was a cool guy so I never even let it be more than an internal thing. I had tried to get her attention a few times on social media and she left me on read so I kinda swiped to be funny. But then a day or so later she swiped back. Was genuinely excited to chat and thought it was so funny that she matched with me but in an awe kinda way. Well we ended up exchanging numbers and texting and she was out of town working and would be back in town soon. Well she comes back home, she comes over we have a great date and the next night she comes over and from there we were inseparable. Only the second week I come down with covid and she calls out of work to stay and take care of me. It was her idea. I was shocked and humbled and very grateful, she has a medical background and became very interested in helping me with my diabetes. 


Which she did, I went from ok to pretty dang good as my doctor would say a cpl months ago. She immediately bonded with him and wow was I amazed at how he stuck to her. They seemed destined to be what my heart had always hoped for when it came to me possibly having a life with someone which would be that he’s just as important to all this as me or you. So everything’s going pretty great and my son ( who was completely in the wrong) didn’t get his way and acted manipulative. Not in a very good way. It was in a way I was very shocked to learn about and to find out from my parents he had tried them and kinda still did from time to time. I was pissed, not gonna lie. More so at myself, but nonetheless I punished him and we moved on. 

Throughout the blending process her boys ( from her prior high school relationship) would come over with their friends and my son never having really being been around older kids was trying wayyy to hard to make an impression to the point they were like “ what’s this kids deal” like he would try to talk smack to them and bomb. well over time he settled and he formed his own bond with her youngest and I can honestly say they are tight. The oldest is just a little too mature for him. Well not to get too far ahead of myself, we move in together and my work really started taking me places and different places. We had begun talking about a life together and she was convinced I needed to be a girl dad ( which at the time I was fearful of). 


So I had a work assignment take me out of town she went with me while we were there I caught her ex snapping her, I confront her about it and she explains she should’ve blocked him and then does, that was red flag number 1. So I forgive and finish at the location we were at. we were supposed to go on a vacation in between work trips( i had one lined up a week after) and while we were on vacation she informs me she’s pregnant. It was super exciting I thought those days were over for me and I don’t think that I had ever been happier. Well work comes and goes and more work and more work and it comes time for us to make a move to a new town so that we can be there to support the two older boys as they graduate high school due to custody arrangements with their father. 


My son while ok with going was pretty upset, he missed his friends and had trouble adjusting and with the benefit of hindsight I see he was lonely and missed all his friends he’d know since he could remember. He had issues with lying about dumb things and not listening to instructions. In the meantime we were blessed with a beautiful and healthy daughter and my wife had a really hard pregnancy, it was rough on her. She was always sick, vomiting, and just had the worst days. I was so proud of her! She made it through and now she could recover. Initially she was really great about everything. I had to leave town a bit the first few months but was always back after a cpl weeks to be there for them and thought I was doing a decent job. Now keep in mind my wife hadn’t worked since we had first gotten together, right before she got pregnant so I was solely providing and was having to work a lot, she would come see me too, so there was times it wasn’t all distance. 


Well when my daughter was 9 months old and I was out working I got a call that she was pregnant and was nervous about going through another pregnancy. I thought she may have been jumping the gun but she was pregnant and while I was out working decided she wanted to have an abortion without me there against my wishes. Now I know that’s a touchy subject and for good reason. My reason was that was our child and as a god fearing individual I believe in gods will. Well we went back and forth and she went to another state and got an abortion a couple days before my birthday and then my grandma died. Ikr , it’s nuts. So I arrived back home the night before my birthday, to go to my grandma’s funeral on my birthday and she had just passed the fetus. 

With all that going on it’s hard to say exactly how I felt but I know that while I didn’t agree I was going to support my wife due to the medical reasons she stated. I end up having to go back to work and keep in mind my wife had no problems spending money, so it was necessary I worked. While working she calls me and starts being very hateful and starts talking about how she doesn’t want to be a mother to my son anymore and that it’s not fair that she couldn’t be a mom to her new child and started talking horrible things about his dead mother ( who wasn’t a saint and if was alive to defend herself would deserve most of it) and just started being extremely hard on him, and really showed her ass. Mostly bc he was just being a boy. 

      But anytime his mom was brought up she really went off, basically demanded that I block his moms relatives on social media and while I initially resisted I knew they would think I was an idiot for letting my marriage go due to social media. She started saying things like I better send him to my parents because she was going to fuck his head up and things like that. I reminded her that we were a package deal and i proceeded to go home and take less work to try to help more around the house and take some off her. Well through trying and doing it became clear nothing I did was good enough or it was wrong or something. I tried harder and harder and then my dad died and my world was shattered. I talked to my pops every dad and saw him often. We were close, she also showed her ass about my sons grandparents coming to his funeral.( they knew and respected each other) But she had chilled out about my son after some extreme moments involving her going to far. I talked to folks and they all told me to be patient that she was gonna have some crazy hormones for a while. after that I felt everything had chilled out, and headed out to make sure that I could provide for the family and pay the bills - basically it was time to work my ass off, while out she tells me she hates being around my son and wishes he wasn’t here. I’m baffled but this time I put my foot down and let her know I’m not playing this. It seemed to work, for like three weeks- she starts saying how my career is flourishing and hers went into the dump. I actually empathized with her and tried to make suggestions all were discounted and brushed off.


I reminded her that she wanted it this way. She asked to be stay at home and that babies while exhausting are worth it. That she will get older and become more independent. Then she starts how our daughter is terrible and my genes are terrible and spends about 7 months researching autism after her nephew was diagnose d. Well I had come home and it was time to go work and while out I receive a text that states she’s glad she had an abortion and that 3 of my kids with my genes would be miserable and a lot of other nasty things including about my son and daughter and me. It naturally upsets me and trying to focus I block her and on social media and tell her to call her oldest ( who I’m letting work with me  to make some extra money which I pay) if she needs me. Well, naturally things cool off and my work which was longer because I refused to let her pull me back home -( she previously made comments that if I failed or came up short on money she would leave me) -because I have to provide. I go back and unblock her on social and see where she had changed her last name and relationship status. It really upset me, I never said anything about all that. It made me feel like something was up ( red flag #2 but in hindsight #17) and I decided that I was going to pay more attention well I come home and do just that. 



She maybe has to spend 4-5 hours a day with our daughter when she wasn’t sick with a cold, uti, ear infection or some other toddler thing with me there helping and being very very active. 


I had come home for my birthday this previous year and something was really off, there was no intimacy no nothing no spark, like she had completely transitioned into who she is now. 


Since then intimacy went from pretty regular even in tough times to non existent even in decent times. I found really strange exchanges between her bestie and even saw where she was reading stories about men hooking up with their mistresses instead of their wives and it wasn’t glamour kinda stories ya know it was the crazy passionate stuff she says it was just taboo and it was nothing.

I went on another work trip and she started fights and the same stuff again, it’s a slower year so when I said hey we gotta tighten up she made comments about me not being a good provider, and I told her that I had been asking her to take on a bill or two( she works one day a week at an er making like $50 and hour) to help and she said if she had to pay bills and work she might as well be by herself- yet when I give her a chance to do that she says she doesn’t want to, I recommend marriage counseling, she stonewalls me, when I tell her I want a second diagnosis on our daughters autism diagnosis because she keeps on talking about the state paying her to take care of her ( when I know she’s been dishonest about things) it’s all come to a head because I’ve had it and was going to leave a few weeks ago but called a ceasefire to try and see if we can have some conversation about things and look at our compatibility since she says we aren’t anymore and to also give me a chance to get to know who she says she is now. I feel like I barely know this person. 


She didn’t exactly raise her boys- she got split custody of them when they were older and while they love her it’s clear that they know who she is. They don’t really like it. She was really quick to say I could take our daughter and let her come every other weekend. Here’s the thing I thought she was cheating but there’s nothing to be found other than nothing. It’s like she talks to no one. I just don’t know, like I’ve tried and I’ve gone to some pretty extreme measure to attempt to make her happy and now while I sit at my parents house and think back there are some weird things - once after one of her episodes where she acted terribly she suggested I go sleep with another woman. It felt odd, considering that I hadn’t seen that coming- a hall pass she called it. Thinking it was weird I told her only if it was a friend of hers someone she trusted and she immediately changed the subject. Well the past cpl weeks since the “ceasefire” I had been making attempts to talk to her only for something to always come up, someone be there when I come in from doing work or some other odd reason that she can’t sit down and have a conversation about our future and what it looks like. Which considering I thought was reasonable due to her actions the past almost 2 years and the fact she used chat gpt to respond to me making an attempt at Conversation.- more than half our marriage. It leads to me just not wanting to talk anymore due to the whole “ why are you bitching” comments lol. 


Nonetheless I wake up and not talking much bc I’m working and I’m civil and she goes to work I was nice and she even stated that she’d like to have a talk with my son about starting over ( like the 3rd time with him- about a week ago she said the same thing to me but the 6th time) and I asked about family therapy and marriage counseling to which she didn’t respond until I let her know that’s a must. Well she comes in and I’m laying in bed and I tell her I’m not feeling well and she goes to watch tv. I’m woken up by our daughter this morning and we get up and she gets her coffee and comes back to the couch sitting opposite side and just says I had a dream you had a girlfriend last night and I immediately felt horrible and was like awe I’m sorry and she laughs and goes no I was cool with it bc you quit bitching and talking to me. She then gets up to kitchen and I follow behind and ask do you really want me to have a girlfriend and she repeats yeah if it’ll make you stop bitching and talking. It was then that I realized that all my patience and effort had been in vain. That she didn’t want to work this out and that I needed to leave so I took my band off and handed to her and said I won’t need this anymore and started packing. 


She goes to work and I tell her that our daughter would stay and I would come get her inthe morning and I block her so I don’t get no chat gpt thing or no wild shit and while my daughter would abide id pack, organized my son and explained to him and her youngest that we were leaving. I let him know that I loved him and always here. He left before she got there which is a good thing and as soon as she got out of shower we left. I was saying by to my daughter and told her we were going to her pawpaws house and she started crying to go, in hindsight if I had thought about it I maybe would’ve just said bye but she accused me of doing it on purpose and idk why but I just handed her the letter i wrote her and picked my daughter up and left after packing as much as I could. She was cool with it and let us leave. There’s more shady things that happen. Idk, I know this has been long winded but has anyone been through this or something similar and what were the truths found later?

Edit as a gentleman pointed out in my posts I’m extremely adhd however I was very loving and affectionate and always available for her. I don’t think I started doing things like paying attention to my phone so much watching videos and what not or sitting outside until she had acted and said the things that have us here now. She didn’t do everything by herself sometimes more sometimes less it all depended on my work but I gave her my 150%",0,1756614630.0,Marriage,17,0.5,False

After much deliberation regarding which grinder to buy (Philos, P64, Z1), I ended up ordering a Z1. Now, I need to find a machine.

**What I need from the machine**  
I'm primarily a light to medium roast espresso drinker. Every morning, I'll have 2–3 espressos in succession, and I'll sometimes have another in the afternoon. I'm not big on a milk drinks, so steaming is not (currently) important to me. However, I'll occasionally make an americano for myself, and many of my guests prefer americanos to espresso. The ""hot water"" spout on my BBE has been quite useful for this.

**Candidate machines and questions**

* **Profitec GO**: A friend of mine with a Profitec GO spoke quite highly of it; after looking into it myself, it indeed looks like a great machine. However, not having a hot water spout gives me pause—I am not sure that I (or my guests) will want to fuss with the machine to simply get some hot water. In addition, it's also possible that my coffee habits will change (or I will have to accommodate the coffee habits of those with whom I may live) in the future. Thus, I was thinking it may be prudent to ""buy once, cry once"" and look into some higher end machines that also have water spouts and perhaps dual boilers.
   * Is this reasoning daft?
* **Profitec MOVE**: I quite like the looks of the Profitecs and their build quality, so I explored their line further. I happend upon the MOVE with my expanded search, which appears to be a feature-rich, higher-end version of the GO. This machine seemed to be a very promising candidate, and people on this sub appear to speak highly of it.
   * Other than price, is there any reason *not* to buy the MOVE over the GO?
   * I know it hasn't been out as long—are there any quality concerns, for example?
* **Profitec RIDE**: Next, I saw the RIDE, which looked to be similar to the MOVE but with an E61 grouphead. E61's are new to me, and I've read many different things about them. From what I can gather, functionally, the difference between an E61 and saturated grouphead doesn't really matter for casual, home use.
   * Would I be correct in saying that the MOVE and RIDE should be thought of as the same machine functionally, meaning that aesthetics alone are sufficient to justify my preference for one vs. the other?
   * Are there important functional differences between these two that I'm not appreciating?
* **Profitec JUMP**: After exploring the RIDE, I noticed the JUMP, which seemed to be a smaller, less feature-rich version of the RIDE.
   * How important are the features that the JUMP is missing, such as precise temperature control, on/off timer, cleaning reminders, etc.?
   * Is there anything that I should know when choosing between the RIDE and the JUMP?
* **Profitec DRIVE**: This appears to be Profitec's flagship model—a fancy E61 with a rotary pump. From the pictures, I'm not a big fan of the reflective meta aesthetic; however, I realize it's possible that pictures may not do it justice.
   * Are the extra features, such as a rotary pump, overkill for casual, home use? Would I really see any benefit from them?
   * Does this machine look better in person than in pictures?

I'm currently leaning towards the MOVE or RIDE, but I am very open to arguments for other machines, including ones that I did not include.
