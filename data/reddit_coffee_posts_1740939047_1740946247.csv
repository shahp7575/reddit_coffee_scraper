1j203d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1j203d2/full_review_of_princess_senses_at_the_mangrove/,Full Review of Princess Senses At The Mangrove,"Hi all. Officially back from an incredible week at this property so here is a lengthy review, feel free to ask any question! 

Prior to starting: 2 adults mid 20s, NON platinum, used Expedia and paid $4800 all together for 8 nights+ flights. 

Check In: We arrived at 3:04pm and checked in around 4:15pm. There were a ton of people all checking in at same time so it was a bit slow- but the staff apologized, made us drinks, and tried their best to speed it up. 

Rooms: Gorgeous! Double sink/ double shower, robes, a mini fridge (sodas and beer), comfy bed, and a balcony with 2 chairs. We had more than enough closet space as well and felt the room was in clean condition.  We were in building 3- second floor.. nice view of euphoria pool and beach. 

Food: The food was fabulous! The buffet was great.. repetitive but delicious. Dinner had pasta and stir fry stations, breakfast had omelette and crepe stations, lunch a grill! Also some dinners had a fish station and grill station with lamb and steak made to order.  We enjoyed every restaurant we tried.. Mexican was my personal favorite. We also ate at the snack bar and the tuna, pasta, wings were all a hit and great mid day snack when we didn‚Äôt want to leave the water for long. There was also a 24/7 coffee shop that made crepes to order, had little sandwiches,pastries, and ice cream (freezer was broken though for 5 days or our stay). If you‚Äôre hungry late at night.. MVP sports bar is open till 4am with good music/ bar and bites you can order. 

Activities: We found the hotel to have a lot of activities available for all types of people! Water aerobics,Pilates,yoga, and abs on the beach or pool deck for the fitness lovers. Rum tasting, Jamaican language courses, soca dance lessons for people looking to feel more connected with the island. Scavenger hunts/trivia were also available! You didn‚Äôt have to participate but if you‚Äôre at the euphoria pool which is the only swim up bar.. you‚Äôll be right where they all happen. There was a different themed show nightly but to be honest these were not great. The staff is trying and the music choices were great but the actual performing did need some work. There is a club on sight and MVP does karaoke for people looking for late night things to do! 

Staff: The staff was great! Kind, receptive, and eager to help. The poolside service was a bit slow but that was the worst of it. Also our mini fridge never got restocked but we also never asked so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs automatic. They also remembered us after a few days and always made an effort to say hello or spark conversation. 

Beach: We‚Äôre not big beach people but if you are.. this may not be for you. The water is a bit rocky (nothing too terrible I went in with no water shoes) but very murky/seaweed filled. It‚Äôs smaller as well. We went in for a bit but really got our beach fill at 7 Mile Beach during an excursion. 

Overall we had an incredible time and would we back.

I'm planning a solo backpacking trip to Bali, and I need help picking the right bags. This is my first time doing a trip like this, and I don‚Äôt have any travel bags yet, so I‚Äôm looking to build a solid setup. Ideally, I want a **Main pack (35-45L), a Sling (for camera/EDC), and a Tote (for laptop/coffee shop runs).**

# What I Need to Carry:

* **Tech:** Laptop + accessories, point-and-shoot camera, small tripod
* **Clothes:** Enough for the trip, but planning to pack light
* **Activities:** Planning to hike, surf, and fish, so durability and some water resistance would be nice
* **Budget:** Not looking to break the bank but still want something functional & stylish

# Bags I‚Äôm Considering:

**Main Pack (35-45L):**

* [Patagonia Black Hole MLC 45L](https://www.patagonia.ca/product/black-hole-mlc-convertible-travel-backpack-45-liters/195699025073.html)
* [Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L](https://www.peakdesign.com/en-ca/products/travel-backpack?Size=45L&Color=Black)

**Sling (Camera + EDC):**

* [Moment Fanny Sling 2L](https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-fanny-sling-2l?variant=47464575861051)
* [Alpaka Go Sling Nano](https://alpakagear.com/products/go-sling-nano)
* [Bellroy Lite Sling Mini](https://bellroy.com/products/lite-sling-mini?color=ash&material=dura_lite_nylon&size=sling_mini#slide-6)

**Tote (For laptop/work days at cafes):**

* [Peak Design Packable Tote](https://www.peakdesign.com/en-ca/products/packable-tote)

# What I Still Need Help With:

* **Packing Cubes:** Any recommendations?
* **Other Essentials:** Anything I should bring that I might not be thinking of?

Would love to hear your thoughts on these bags or if there‚Äôs something better I should check out. Thanks!",1,1740945871.0,onebag,1,1.0,False
1j1zyu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1j1zyu5/being_a_parent_is_sooo_hard/,Being a parent is sooo hard,"Ever since I became a mom, I dont think I got a minute to myself to do something as little as enjoy a shower. I am so happy and in love with my baby but when I think about my situation, I feel a bit sorry for myself. I cannot do any of the things I used to enjoy before because its either not baby friendly or just hard. For example, just going out for a cup of coffee is hard. Forget about logistics I just wont be able to just sit and enjoy because baby will be fussy or want to nurse. If baby is sleeping I will just be stressing of her waking up anytime so I‚Äôll gulp that coffee and just sit there anxious which defeats the purpose. But then I stay at home and while I am more comfortable I just feel so lonely. i dont even feel like a person more like a baby tending machine. But I also feel so grateful of having this baby, that kills me with her cuteness, makes me feel so much love for her. I‚Äôve literally never been more happy and more miserable in my entire life. All at the same time. 
I am now soo impressed by parents out there, you are superheroes and you dont get enough credit!

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

1j1zrix,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j1zrix/my_38m_girlfriends_27f_guy_friend_who_proposed/,My (38m) girlfriend's (27F) guy friend who proposed his love during the beginning of our relationship just popped back up after a year of no contact. She's giving him another chance at friendship. How do I navigate this?,"Hi all,

Just wanted to check in and get some unbiased advice from people with no skin in the game. My friends are such relationship-doomers and have my back to a fault so it would truly be counterproductive going to them :-P Here's what is going on:

My girlfriend and I are coming up on our one-year, and so far, I have been the most fulfilled and secure with this relationship than I have in any previous relationships. She's honest, open, loving, caring, crazy smart, empathetic, and beyond that we get along as best friends. We've been damn near inseparable for the entire year, and our time together is spent with extreme joy. When we aren't together, we constantly miss each other. Even with this current situation, she's been completely transparent with me, and I have no issues leaving the ball in her court with this one. I would, however, like some insight as to how to navigate this as painlessly as possible on my end, deep down and stuff.

When we initially started dating, my girlfriend was living with a guy friend of hers. They grew up together, and when she moved across the country, he eventually ended up out here with her and she let him move into her house as her roommate. This all happened before we met. I can confidently say they were not romantically involved when they were living together. However, when her and I met and started dating, he started getting really upset and passive aggressive towards her, giving her the silent treatment in her own home and being tense etc. I never met him, as he always left the house before I came over, and wouldn't return until I left, even if I stayed until 2am. I've never met him or exchanged a word. At around the one-month mark of our relationship things were going fucking awesome and her and I were obviously falling in love fast and hard. He told her he was moving out, got really weird until the last minute, and then proceeded to drop the bomb the evening he moved out: He was in love with her and he didn't know how to control his feelings and it was making him act out. I don't know the full context of the conversation, but I do know that he forced her to ""hash it out"" until like 2 in the morning. She told him she was not in love with him, did not have feelings for him, and that it was never going to happen. He ended up speed packing and storming out that night and leaving the state.

During this phase I'm not trying to inject myself at all, as my girlfriend seems to have a complete handle on the situation, all while showering me with love and affection and secure affirmations. Guy friend is out of the picture totally having gone no-contact. Fast forward about 2 months - My girlfriend and I are hanging out together and she pulls her phone out to show me something, and I spot a text message convo with this guy on the top of her messages. I see it, and I say nothing. Fast forward a few more days. We're hanging out, and a text pops up on her phone while it sits on the coffee table in front of me. Guy friend again. This time I inquire, calmly, if they were back on good terms again. She tells me that he reached out to her with an apology, and that she was willing to put the whole 'love reveal' debacle aside, and that they had been cordially chatting for a few weeks. I read the messages, and while they were relatively benign and innocent, there wasn't any real communication about what had happened. Just a simple sorry and a sweep under the rug. I won't lie, it bothered me slightly, but once again, I trust this woman and I absolutely respect her right to choose her friends, so I left the ball in her court. It wasn't until she revealed to me a few days later that they had been facetiming to watch Game of Thrones together that I felt I had to set a boundary. That just felt way too intimate for me and I was a bit concerned they hadn't done any serious communication about what happened. At this point, she tells him that it's probably still a bit too soon for them to pick back up as friends and that they should limit their contact a bit. From here, he goes no-contact again.

Fast forward 8 months to present day. My girlfriend is working a night shift and sends me a screenshot of a long wall of text she received from guy friend, which he tastefully decided to send around midnight. It's a big apology, explaining that he knew he was wrong, and that there were reasons he ""wont go into"" surrounding why he acted the way he did. He said that he will respect all boundaries she sets and that if she wants him to ""fuck off"" he will, which he reiterated multiple times throughout the text. It seemed desperate, and still lacking the nuance and communication I'd expect from someone looking to really repair a friendship after having crossed the Rubicon of romantic feelings. Once again, I told her that the ball was in her court. I slept on it feeling totally secure in everything, even if slightly annoyed that he desperately popped back up in the middle of the night.

This morning I woke up and asked her what she decided on. She told me that she accepted his apology, and that she was okay with them being friends and communicating again, with boundaries. She reinforced to me that he is not her ""best guy friend"" and that I am, which I feel confident in. She told him that their friendship will never be the same, which I believe. She told me that she will not be texting him every day, and that if he tries to, she will tell him to give some distance.

It just leaves a bit of a pit in my stomach, and to be honest, this guy is taking up way too much of my mental and emotional real estate with minimal effort on his end. Never even met the guy and I'm doing something I thought I'd never have to do in my relationship: Make a post on relationship advice. I love my girlfriend immensely, I'm committed to making it work long-term, and I value her freedom to nurture her friendships more than my own feelings or preconceived notions about her friends. I trust her with this one, even if I don't trust him. I guess I'm just looking for some nuanced guidance from people on how to feel better about this. If he does become a more constant figure in her life, how do I let go of my distrust of him? I obviously trust her, and if she wants to nurture that friendship to any degree, is there any mental exercises I can do to put some perspective on it? If he's not going anywhere, is it in my best interest to get to know him and try to befriend him myself? I'm sure he's not a bad guy, he's just in love with the woman I'm in love with, which definitely got him and I off on the wrong foot. Any advice helps.

Also, please do not tell me to break up with my girlfriend: I will not. I've also got a pretty good radar for being lied to and infidelity, and I am 100000% confident that she is not interested in this guy romantically. She isn't cheating. She's just a really, really considerate and caring person - even for this guy.",1,1740945340.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I'm really sad to be moving out after being here nearly 5 years and absolutely love the unit, but i don't WFH at all and spend too much time commuting, so i'm moving back to Manhattan much to my wallet's sadness for a shittier unit at a higher price.  So it goes!

This description is modified from my (pending) streeteasy listing, so apologies it sounds a little ChatGPT'y lol.

**About the unit:**

Sun-soaked, south facing, quiet 4th (top) floor condo with a balcony, great layout, and luxury finishes uncommon at this price point.  The condo has a custom closet with ample storage and all lights have dimmable switches. 600 sq ft and one of the best layouts for this sq footage, super practical and flexible.

The floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom have dual sun-screen and black-out automatic curtains and the living room has a gorgeous floor to ceiling light-filtering shade that can also black-out.  All-day sun through the architecture-line floor to ceiling Pella windows makes the unit both warm and also just gorgeous all day.  You don't need to turn on the heat in the winter because there's so much sun.

There are real, white oak 5 inch plank floors, built-in fridge, Bosch appliances, in-unit Electrolux washer/dryer, and a small entry foyer that helps reduce neighbor noise dramatically.

701 Lafayette is a owner-operated condo that's been greatly cared for and the owner for 4A has made several upgrades to the unit, such as enhanced insulation in the walls and ceiling for comfort, ceiling speakers that can be hooked up to a receiver, and more.  No surrounding units and being on the top floor means the place is very quiet.  The unit is right on Herbert von King park and you can see the park from the living room.

**Location:**

You're 2 blocks from the G and the B38 is literally across the building, with a Citibike dock 1 minute away.  Herbert von King park is lovely and right on your doorstep, with lively summer activities and a number of coffee shops.

**Rent amount:**

\- $3,150.  (For context, Unit 2A, which has no balcony, a smaller layout, obstructed views, noisier, no aftermarket insulation, no smart-home touches/etc, rented out last year in a softer rental market for $3,000).

\- There is a 1-time, non-refundable move in fee for the condo of $1,500.

\- 1 month security deposit is required.

**Lease term:**

\- Open to 12, 28, and 24 month leases, as well as leaving the condo partially furnished for an additional cost depending on what is left.  In particular, the home theater set up is extremely extensive (5.2.2) and expensive and i'm pretty loathe to uninstall it but of course i'm planning to unless someone wants to rent with it.

**Requirements:**

\- You must make at least 45x the monthly rent.  There is a move-in fee equal to 0.5 months rent and a 2 month deposit is required.

\- No pets, sorry

\- Really looking for a respectful tenant who can take care of my condo.  I'm hoping you'll love it as much as i have and potentially stay for a long time, and have a great landlord-tenant relationship!

Not to be boastful, but I make quite good money right now. Let's just say I'm currently in a position where I have $6k+ excess cash a month that I just put directly into my investment accounts and HYSA. And I've been doing that for 2 years, so financially I'm quite in a good spot. But I'm terrible at treating myself.


I haven't taken a ""proper"" vacation like travelling in any way these years. Solo travel feels scary and I'm scared I won't like it that much and it'll be a waste of money. I don't buy snacks like chips or buy coffee outside because I keep thinking to myself ""that's such a waste of money, I won't get $6 of enjoyment out of that!"" I feel unwilling to buy like things I consider too expensive even if they're cheap. Like most of my meals I make for myself are just chicken breast/thigh/ground beef as a protein because salmon/shrimp feel too expensive, and $15+ for any meal feels crazy. I also never order food out because I feel bad spending like $25 on delivery for a single lunch. I haven't bought any clothing in the past 2 years besides a new pair of shoes (because I'm a person who legit just has one pair of everyday shoes that I replace every 2 years) because I have perfectly good clothing and it feels wasteful both money and environmentally to dispose of it.


I know this isn't simply a ""you're being cheap!"" thing because I have no problem spending money on other people. I recently paid for my parents' vacation to their home country. I'm always happy to treat my friends who are unemployed/make less than me to meals because I want them to just have fun and I enjoy their company. It's just when it comes to money on myself I feel overly stingy.


I feel this is hindering some aspects of my life (outdated fashion, not eating the food/drink I want unless I have company, not going out often). It's like I can finally afford things but I hate spending money if it's on myself. Like I'll be envious of people who have cool things or are doing cool things and I'm like, yeah I can afford it and do it too but the money sink will make me feel like shit.

I'm aware this is a super privileged problem to have and some people will be like ""wish I had this guy's problem!"" But it's like, since going from making very little to my current income, my expenditure and financial mindset has not changed.",1,1740945040.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

Editor note: My mother abstained from voting in the 2021 and 2022 Oscars season for being disinterested in the nominations and the films of those years. She did however vote in the 2023 Oscars, but was too busy in pre-production to chat about her choices.

My mother has been a member of the producers branch since the early 2000s. She has never been nominated for an Oscar, however, she has worked on 3 Oscar winning films. She wants me to clarify to everyone that she is indeed not an American and that has definitely factored into some of her opinions and choices. For obvious reasons, I can't give too much detail, but my mother has never been shy of controversy and/or expressing her feelings on things she likes and hates. Anyway, on that note, grab a coffee/tea and let's begin!

**Best Motion Picture of the Year**  

**Nickel Boys** wasn't for me. I just couldn‚Äôt get into it, and the first-person perspective didn't grab me. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for it at the time of watching and there were plenty of other films I wanted to watch this year. I turned it off half way through. 

**A Complete Unknown** -- I didn‚Äôt like that film much better, it was just eh, and I preferred 'Sing Sing'. It‚Äôs just your run-of-the-mill biopic, like, he was this enigma--the music was great, sure--but when I think of that film, I just think of Elle Fanning. I found her to be the best part of that entire snore-fest and it was an utter shame to not see her nominated. Like, the other girl [Barbaro], she can sing yeah, but whoop-de-doo. I know people think of her singing, but I didn't think it was much to write home about. 

**Emilia P√©rez** -- I actually really liked it in the end. It was something different, I‚Äôd never seen a scary trans drug kingpin before. I didn‚Äôt like the singing. It was weird, but I didn‚Äôt think of it as a musical, I felt it would‚Äôve played better as a contemporary film.

**I‚Äôm Still Here** -- I like it. I liked that they used different lenses and camera types to tell the story. It was just like watching a simple story with an underlying meaning to it. There was a subtle power to it. I thought she was going to be more of an activist than a mother to the family in the film, though. Felt like that the film didn‚Äôt quite know how to end. The age differences of the family members I found confusing. 

**Wicked** -- I didn‚Äôt mind Wicked, it was just that there were other movies I liked better this year. I‚Äôm not a fan of Ariana Grande, she felt like she was playing her childhood self. I don‚Äôt know, I just preferred others. I enjoyed it more than I thought I was going to. And you know, it was good all the way through. Jeff Goldblum wasn‚Äôt very good. For someone that was meant to be the good wizard, he wasn‚Äôt like he was meant to be, and truthfully, I felt as though his acting wasn't particularly good--I wasn't convinced by it. 

**The Substance** was very brave and unique. The style of it all. It was different. Even though horror films aren‚Äôt my favourite thing to watch, I liked the production design. It reminded me of a very colourful 2001 space odyssey. Her paranoia getting worse and worse. She really threw herself at the role. Her paranoia to stay relevant in comparison to Margret Qualley‚Äôs character. The last act reminded me very much of Carrie (1976). I would‚Äôve preferred an ending that was gorier, with her head exploding or something, but rather it felt a little too overly dramatic and a touch indulgent, but I don‚Äôt know, I think I just came out of that film liking Demi. 

**Dune: Part 2** -- I think cinematically, it was very beautiful. The colour palette and effects were beautiful. I wasn‚Äôt keen on Timoth√©e‚Äôs deeper voice in the film. I liked the story, it was quite beautiful to watch.

**The Brutalist** -- I didn‚Äôt realise it was made for under $10 million, which I found very impressive for what the film achieved with its limited budget. The ending was messy, but it was beautiful to look at. Visually, across the board, it was stunning, but I think it could've used a little more editing, to cut down on a few scenes. The ending was terrible. The film should‚Äôve ended with the buildings and architecture, and letting it speak for itself. I didn't need someone to explain to me how I should feel about this man's journey and achievements--just show me, visually, how beautiful, striking and brutalist it was. I didn‚Äôt like Felicity (Jones). I thought Guy Pearce was really good, he‚Äôs an excellent actor, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever done anything bad. Adrien Brody, however, was transcendent. A beautifully striking film that, had it ended better, would've been my choice for Best Picture.  

**Anora** was a great film that kept pace, and had a great supporting cast, it was funny and it was sad, dramatic in parts. Typical Russian oligarch's son -- wasteful -- and I loved that. I like Yura as a supporting role a lot. He [Sean Baker] has relatable characters. He sees traits that make the human elements shine in his films, and I find that a talent that should be recognised.  
 
My vote this year though is going to **Conclave** because it was a surprisingly intriguing film. The editing kept it tight. The political nuance of the film was so beautifully done. The ending I didn‚Äôt see coming. I loved the costumes. There was no yelling, but everything was done so quietly and I loved every moment of the film. The sets were beautiful. I really liked Ralph Fiennes. It was such a beautiful film to watch. The tightest film I saw all year. There was nothing I thought was unnecessary. It all had a purpose. Each character was intriguing. This random cardinal, where did he come from and what‚Äôs his story? I adored it all. 


**My Vote:** 10. Nickel Boys; 9. A Complete Unknown; 8. Emilia P√©rez; 7. I'm Still Here; 6. Wicked; 5. The Substance; 4. Dune: Part 2; 3. The Brutalist; 2. Anora; 1. Conclave  



**Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role**

My vote's going to Adrien Brody -- I think he gave it everything. He‚Äôs been out for a while and he made that film, he carried that film very well. Colman Domingo had a very powerful and understated performance in Sing Sing, and had it been a lesser year, I would've voted for him.
Sebastian Stan I really enjoyed, and I really didn‚Äôt expect to enjoy the film as much as I did. He did a good job, but am I saying that because he‚Äôs done lesser Marvel films in the past? I enjoyed the film, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs performance was all that amazing. Jeremy Strong had a journey for his character. You know, he started out as this scary man, and ended up being a frail sick old man by the end. Stan‚Äôs playing Trump, who‚Äôs a complete buffoon, but I believed that the H&MU helps make him play that part more than the performance. It was an interesting take to have sympathy for Trump as a man in that dysfunctional family. There was an insecurity to the performance. The vulnerable insecurity that [Jeremy] Strong had in the end, though. That really surprised me. There‚Äôs friends, who are really your friends, but you were nothing more than what you were paid to do -- there was a tragedy there.  

Ralph Fiennes does a good role in every film I've every seen of him. Having worked with him, I can attest to his modesty and professionalism, but I won't be voting for him.  

Timoth√©e though? Meh. He‚Äôs playing a known character. Did he do a good job? Yeah, but he's not the new Leonardo DiCaprio. Will he win Oscars in the future?. Yeah, probably, but I don‚Äôt look at his role and go: you were spectacular. He did a good job, but his performance was standard, and he‚Äôs oversaturated in the market unlike Adrien Brody, who is not. He gave it everything and that's why I voted for him


**My vote:** Adrien Brody -- The Brutalist



**Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role**

Mikey Madison -- she was good, but I don't know, she‚Äôs new, her time will come. She played a prostitute. How hard was it to have inspiration for that role? She was just a stripper. There‚Äôs a lot of background work and study that she can do to easily fall into that role, but Demi‚Äôs role, there‚Äôs more to that performance, it was wholly her own.
Fernanda Torres -- I liked her subtle performance. There was this calm subtlety to it. Those nuances, when you look back on it, she was driving that film. There was a power to it all.
My vote's going to Demi Moore -- because she threw everything into this performance. It was an everything role for her -- she did everything for that role. An aged-up actress getting naked next to someone in their mid twenties, there‚Äôs a lot of vulnerability. There‚Äôs no roles for actresses in their old age any more. And she just gets more and more crazy towards end, I just loved it. 
Karla Sof√≠a Gasc√≥n -- I‚Äôm not even gonna go there -- she was mediocre at best.
Cynthia Erivo -- I thought she was really good. Can she sing? Hell yeah. Did she have vulnerability? Yeah. But I don‚Äôt think I liked her performance a lot. The longing to belong, it all got repetitive. She was always the good person in that film. She wasn‚Äôt the one I would've voted for.

**My vote:** Demi Moore -- The Substance



**Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role**

I thought all the performances were very strong this year -- except for Kieran [Culkin]. I‚Äôve seen Kieran play this role before, it‚Äôs nothing to go crazy for. He‚Äôs not going outside his wheelhouse that he hasn't already played before in Succession. He‚Äôs happy, and he‚Äôs sad, and he does it well, but he's not going outside what he knows. Did he do anything spectacular? No. Everyone else was better in the supporting roles. Yura [Borisov] and Edward Norton had such warmth and subtle roles. Edward Norton played a real person really well. It was different to what he‚Äôs played in the past. It was an enjoyable and relatable character who stood by another singer on their death bed and I cared for his performance. 

Yura Borisov I thought had an exceptional performance. He was sympathetic, quiet and powerful. He had great comedic timing in that film. Better performance than Guy Pearce, I thought. To be that quiet background character that manages to nail the comedic timing as well as he does -- and sure the editing helped with that -- but to outshine all the other supporting cast was honestly just outstanding. I'd love to see him in more films! There‚Äôs this organic-ness to Sean Baker‚Äôs directing. Guy Pearce was great, there was that underlying sinister character the whole time, but for me, Jeremy Strong is my pick for this category. His character had an evolution throughout that film. He was also, unlike Kieran, different enough from his Succession character that I felt like i was watching the character he was playing and not a rehash of what I've seen before.

**My vote:** Jeremy Strong -- The Apprentice



**Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role**

Felicity Jones -- nope. Isabella Rossellini -- nope. It was very small role, but she was quite powerful in the small pocket she had in that film. She came off as a repressed woman. I really don't like Ariana Grande, so I refuse to vote for her. [Note: redacted comments on Ariana Grande]. Monica Barbaro -- nope. She can sing: whoop-de-doo. I know people think of her singing, but I didn't think it was much to write home about, so I'm not voting for her. When I think of that film, I think of Elle Fanning. 

To be honest, none of the supporting actresses were memorable this year, the only reason Ariana Grande was even remotely memorable, was because she  was on nice sets and in nice costumes. Zoe‚Äôs gonna win and I‚Äôm gonna vote for her. Zoe put everything into that film. She carried that film. I do, however, think it's outrageous that Zoe Salda√±a is going to win for a leading performance, in a supporting actress category. I'm voting for her in jest. 

**My vote:** Zoe Salda√±a -- Emilia P√©rez



**Best Achievement in Directing**

James Mangold... his film was meh. Felt like something I've seen a million times before. It was generic. The whole film was Timoth√©e being handed guitars and playing to people in rooms... boring! Jacques Audiard's film should not have been a song and dance. Would've played better as something more contemporary. Coralie Fargeat, though, she made something really clever. Some of the choices she made were exceptional. A horror film winning best director is not happening, though. If you looked at her film more analytically, I think we‚Äôd have an equal opinion of both her and Baker [Sean]. I believe it should‚Äôve ended earlier and in a different way. The ending went too French-weird, and fair enough, but to that end point, it was just a real tightness to the frame where everything contributed to an incredible film. I loved the mise en sc√®ne.  

Now, Brady Corbet -- although it was very tight with Baker. I think what he did with that budget, is something to be noted. The choices in all stylistic approaches should be awarded. He made such an epic film out of something that was so cavernous. The choices of VistaVision and the perspectives of it all, it was beautiful. Brady fell apart with the ending, but there was no failure in Sean‚Äôs ending -- it was what he wanted. The whole presentation at the end. Everything had volume to it, there was greatness. The ending was narrow, rather than grand and epic. He just made some choices as a director that made the ending not clean. I voted for Sean Baker because Conclave wasn't nominated.

**My vote:** Sean Baker -- Anora



**Best Original Screenplay**

A Real Pain, I just hate Jesse Eisenberg. He wants to be the second coming of Woody Allen. It was neurotic. He just annoys me. He‚Äôs just such an asshole and he thinks he‚Äôs just too cool for school. I want to throttle him: no one finds you funny. The Brutalist was a great story, because you thought it to be true, but it was fictional. The Substance, I thought was an interesting take on an ageing woman and I liked that take -- I haven't seen it told like that before. September 5 wasn‚Äôt an original story. Sure, the discussions are fictional, but are they interesting? No. The Americans were ignorant of the Germans in Germany. I don‚Äôt think it should win, feels like a filler. Jesse Eisenberg best not have anything in 2026.

**My vote:** Anora



**Best Adapted Screenplay**

Conclave -- I found it gripping. I was invested from the start, to the end. Catholicism is not interesting, and that somehow made it gripping and rich in colour. It had intrigue. These men in the story were envious and ambitious. I never saw that ending coming, either. A Complete Unknown was Timoth√©e mumbling a lot: I loved when he sang, there was a soulfulness to it, but it was in an age where lots of things were happening. I don‚Äôt think the film was tight. Emilia P√©rez, they don‚Äôt sing in the book, so why are they singing in the movie? Sing Sing I really really liked, but Nickel Boys, just no. It wasn‚Äôt Jesse Eisenberg bad, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me.

**My vote:** Conclave



**Best Achievement in Cinematography**

The Brutalist. This is a no-brainer. For the budget of the film, and what he achieved, it‚Äôs gotta be. Take away or diminish the other aspects of the film, would you still consider the film to be great? Probably not. Greig Fraser does great work with Dune [Part 2], but he had a higher budget to work with with Dune and what he can achieve with a lens and a big budget is something that should be commemorated. He knows how to fill a frame.  

I quite liked Nosferatu, it was B&W photography, and that‚Äôs not easy to do. It was clear. Reminded me of The Batman‚Äôs cinematography. It was a very beautiful looking film. I didn‚Äôt watch Maria. Emilia P√©rez was meh, I‚Äôve seen it all before. There was nothing that was different about it that made it stand out. There was nothing different about its cinematography. 

**My Vote:** The Brutalist



**Best Achievement in Film Editing**

My vote's going to Conclave. There‚Äôs nothing in this film that I‚Äôd change; every decision made kept me within that film. The calmness of it all, it just made a really tight film. Anora was pretty good, but you know, it‚Äôs a chaotic story and the editing fits that story well. Emilia P√©rez... we're not even gonna talk about that. The Wicked editing was mainly about the talking -- you did a close-up when they sang, wide when they evoke, extreme close-up when there's tears etc, there was nothing they could‚Äôve done with that film to make it less generic. The Brutalist, they really could‚Äôve just cut a lot from that film. From the moment they jumped forward in time (after the intermission) really made for a lesser film. They really should‚Äôve done better with that ending.

**My vote:** Conclave



**Best Achievement in Production Design**

I voted for Wicked here -- I wouldn't be sad if Dune won, though. Wicked was beautiful and colourful and layered, but my only caveat is that they would‚Äôve been inspired by the theatre. I mean, I don't know how much of the production design in The Brutalist wasn't just location work, the marble scene was beautiful, but just because the film's about architecture, does that mean I should vote for it? I don't think so. I just thought there was more work done in Dune and Wicked. A world that doesn‚Äôt exist and the layers and depth that went into them. I think Conclave is very very beautiful -- they recreated the Vatican -- but then again, they‚Äôre recreating something that‚Äôs already real. I thought Nosferatu was very nice and created that world. It‚Äôs a shame it was in this year‚Äôs nominations because maybe I would've voted for it in another year.

**My vote:** Wicked



**Best Achievement in Costume Design**

There's a lot of work that has gone into Wicked. Different colours, different styles, the background artists. Loved all the costumes of the main two. Conclave, they‚Äôre plain robes, they‚Äôre not creating those from scratch. They‚Äôre wearing white ropes with red over the top and little caps--all of this exists and has so for a very long time. I think the costumes in Nosferatu were complimentary to the film, but the costumes in A Complete Unknown are just the 70s, and we‚Äôve seen it all before. I didn't watch Gladiator 2, but Gladiator 2‚Äôs costumes were probably just something they pulled from the previous films, so there‚Äôs nothing to write home about there.

**My vote:** Wicked



**Best Achievement in Sound**

The Wild Robot was pretty good, as was Wicked. But Dune, there was just so much more to deal with. Lots of layering went into that‚Äôs film‚Äôs soundscape, The Wild Robot's sound was surprisingly very good. Emilia P√©rez was meh -- shooting guns, perhaps? It was part-musical and they should‚Äôve just gotten rid of all the musical parts. A Complete Unknown was just Bob Dylan singing songs, and people in the 70s just sitting and listening. There was no clapping or singing along. Did it sound beautiful, yeah, but that‚Äôs about all it was. I didn't care for it.

**My vote:** Dune: Part 2



**Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling**

My votes going to The Substance, as it was just wild. The opening of the back, and the slow and disgusting disfigurements, the ageing of Demi Moore. When you saw them lying on the floor, it just all looked wild and disgusting. A Different Man was a real person, so what makeup did they really use? Sebastian Stan looked different, but not to the level of The Substance. Wicked? She‚Äôs just green, whoop-de-doo. It‚Äôs nothing wild -- sure the hairstyling was cool, but that‚Äôs what you have in a mystical musical with a budget that size. Emilia P√©rez was nothing, just looked like everyday people. Nosferatu, they were mostly in B&W. How much did you really see? They were period-worthy, but that was it. A lot of work went into The Substance, so that's why it's getting my vote.

**My vote:** The Substance



**Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score)**

Wicked came from an existing score, so no. Conclave, I found to fit well between the dialogue. The Wild Robot was very beautiful. The score kicks into the soundscape of the film very well, I thought -- it was very beautiful to listen to. Emilia P√©rez was just whatever. The Brutalist was just an epic score to listen to for a film that epic and I feel like it delivered. 

**My vote:** The Brutalist



**Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Song)**

I chose Sing Sing because it didn‚Äôt get more nominations when it should've. I ignored Emilia P√©rez. The entire song catalogue was forgettable this year. Elton John was whatever; has anyone actually seen this film? And Journey... no thanks.

**My vote:** Sing Sing



**Best Achievement in Visual Effects**

I didn‚Äôt see Alien, Kingdom, or Better Man. Better Man is a poor man‚Äôs Kingdom [of the Planet of the Apes]. I‚Äôm not too familiar with visual effects, but I found Dune's to be the best. Wicked‚Äôs CGI wasn‚Äôt anything to note. It wasn‚Äôt a creation of a whole world like Dune was, so that's why i voted for it.

**My vote:** Dune: Part 2



**Best Documentary Feature**

No Other Land is important to see. It was just so moving and sad. Porcelain War I loved, though. I really wanna buy one of those figures. Black Box Diaries I liked. It was a very powerful film. Sugarcane, I mean, it was an interesting view, but I think there were just some more powerful, urgent, and important films nominated this year. Soundtrack to a Coup d‚ÄôEtat I couldn‚Äôt get into, it just didn‚Äôt wow me.

**My vote:** No Other Land



**Best Animated Feature Film**

The Wild Robot was beautiful with a lovely message about relying more and more on AI and robotics and the hesitation of it all. Flow is silent, and it‚Äôs a cute little film. I didn‚Äôt watch Inside Out 2. Wallace and Gromit I really loved, but it‚Äôs always nominated. There‚Äôs a lot of work that goes into the stop motion, but yeah, they‚Äôre just a great little film. Memoir of a Snail I just don‚Äôt remember. 

**My vote:** The Wild Robot



**Best Animated Short Film**

Beautiful Men was interesting, but it was only okay. Beurk! Was interesting and cutesy little film set in a little caravan park. In the Shadow of the Cypress was a very nice little film -- it was beautiful. Magic Candies was cute and nice. Wander to Wonder was the only one I like because it was a little sad.

**My vote:** Wander to Wonder



**Best Live Action Short Film**

This was a little tough. They were all pretty good! A Lien was about trying to get a green card and them getting taken away. I‚Äôm Not a Robot was interesting. Anuja was just about a pair of sisters that work in a bag factory and it was nice. I liked it. The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent is a hot topic of those of different ethnicities getting sent away. The Last Ranger I didn‚Äôt watch.

**My vote:** The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent



**Best Documentary Short Film**

All of these were excellent. It was very hard for me to choose, but I‚Äôm gonna vote for Incident because the whole film is created from video images. The tension of it all just came together for me. I loved all the footage from police and security cameras. I‚Äôm ready, Warden was very very good. An all too familiar story about someone in the justice system. Instruments of a Beating Heart, I wish this would win, but I can‚Äôt imagine it would ever, which is a shame, but I really loved the performativity of it all. The Only Girl in the Orchestra was a fascinating watch about the first woman in the New York orchestra, but i'm voting for Incident.

**My vote:** Incident



**Best International Feature Film**

I'm not choosing I‚Äôm Still Here. I didn‚Äôt like Girl and the Needle. I didn‚Äôt like Emilia P√©rez, so let's kill that one now. Flow was very sweet, about a cat in a silent film that meets and travels with a group of animals. The Seed of the Sacred Fig I loved. The oppression of women in Iranian culture, and their dad being a lawyer -- the way it progressed was an exceptional film. It came to such a beautiful climatic ending. 

**My vote:** The Seed of the Sacred Fig

1j1zf0r,https://i.redd.it/90m1iyvpxbme1.jpeg,Grande rant about ‚Äúnew connection standards‚Äù and partner safety,"Long vent: TLDR below

So, there‚Äôs a guy that lives across the street that used to hang out outside store all the time. Hadn‚Äôt seen him in a while and I saw him yesterday for the first time in ages. He came in with someone who bought him coffee and food, I thought the person with him was his case worker or something, but likely was just a stranger. For context, the apartment complex across the street is a halfway house. For lack of a better term. Anyway. I‚Äôm polite and nice, ask where he‚Äôs been and how he‚Äôs doing and he starts telling me he‚Äôs got cancer and struggling and all kinds of stuff. 


In an attempt to go above and beyond and ‚Äúback to Starbucks‚Äù manner, I package his food and coffee, and plan to hand deliver it and thank him for coming in. (He had left for a moment so I spent a few minutes waiting to give him his stuff) 

He comes back in, I hand him his stuff and thank him and ‚ÄúI hope you enjoy!‚Äù and asks me if I want a job being his live in nurse. I say no. Then he continues to ask me if I‚Äôd be interested in being his at home nurse, and that ‚Äúbecause they never have white nurses‚Äù and he ‚Äúenjoys me‚Äù he would love to have me work for him. I kindly decline and tell him I have a hurt shoulder and make money that works well for me and have good benefits. Then he seems annoyed and says ‚Äúlook it‚Äôs not that hard I mostly just need a housekeeper, you can‚Äôt sweep or do dishes??‚Äù I again politely decline. 


He comes back in (now the 3rd time in one day) and said he‚Äôs called his nurse workers manager and talked to her and got a salary amount and again lists off the duties I would perform etc. and asks me to take her number down. Because I‚Äôm feeling uncomfortable at this point and start to panic, I write down the information he‚Äôs giving me in the hopes he will drop it, because I don‚Äôt want to create a whole scene, especially knowing he lives across the street. Hoping that appeasing him in this way will help him leave me alone. 

THEN a 4th time in one day comes in and leaves his personal number with one of our baristas for me.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So no, when I‚Äôm being told I should work somewhere else because I don‚Äôt ‚Äúuphold Starbucks standard‚Äù and don‚Äôt ‚Äúconnect well enough‚Äù and should write on cups etc to make good connections- this is why. What makes this worse is this is NOT the first time something like this has happened to me. I‚Äôve had strangers call the store saying they were watching me (while moaning into the phone and making explicit noises), I‚Äôve been followed, I‚Äôve had customers come in asking for me specifically, and more.


I‚Äôm fucking SICK of my kindness being taken too far or out of context, so no. No fucking opinion is going to change my mind and NO. I am not okay with how myself and other people get treated sometimes, especially when we are just being nice.


TLDR- yet another example of why people are uncomfortable with our ‚Äúnew‚Äù standards and why I‚Äôm sick of hearing how we should do more for customers, and when we do- they take kindness out of context. This is a great example of why ‚ÄúStarbucks feels different now‚Äù and ‚Äúwe used to be so much better at connecting with customers, what happened?‚Äù 

This. This is the shit that happens. 

Now I get to spend my days either wondering if this guys that lives across the street is going to be an issue for me. All because I wanted to be nice.",8,1740944463.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

Trying to figure out if previous doses of things I was on (there are a lot) were too high. Currently trying a generic Adderall IR booster (10mg) with Vyvanse 30mg (down from 50mg; usually it only takes a day or two to adjust).

So the first day, IR did nothing. I tried taking 2 as 20mg is at least a little effective for me (though doesn't solve certain problems still) for two daays in a row now. Still nothing. The Vyvanse only kind of works in the late afternoon regardless of how early I take it, and wears off earlier each day.

Additionally:  
\- I do drink coffee, whether I do or don't or how much doesn't impact much (I've tested this).  
\- I do try to eat a good breakfast (again, no impact) and maintain generally healthy habits.  
\- My sleep hasn't been great but that doesn't really impact meds for me either, as I've gotten the same amount of sleep and had 'good' days regardless.  
\- I take Vitamin D.  
\- I literally cannot find L-tyrosine anywhere.  
\- I have already been on higher doses of both of these meds, other generics, brand name versions, Adderall XR, guanfacine, Strattera, Wellbutrin, modafinil, Concerta, and Qelbree. I was unable to get prior authorization for Mydayis or dexedrine.

My dentist has not mentioned it but my receded gums bother me aesthetically. I will be starting Invisalign soon and the orthodontists from the few consultations I did seemed unconcerned. 

It‚Äôs been a rough 10 years for my teeth and my mental health. 

I was in college from 2015-2019 and did not take good care of my teeth. I never missed a 6 month dental cleaning, but I also was not flossing, was brushing once a day with a manual toothbrush for less than a minute, and drinking SO MUCH soda, coffee, and sugary alcoholic drinks. Based on pictures of myself, I think my gums started receding from poor oral hygiene around 2018. 

I graduated in spring 2019 and immediately started an office job. It was a rough transition to always being around my friends and people my age in college to living alone in a new city. Then Covid hit. I started working from home, still living alone. There were points I didn‚Äôt talk to another human for weeks at a time. My mental health tanked. I was very depressed and don‚Äôt remember brushing my teeth much. Definitely wasn‚Äôt flossing. Still drinking sugary everything. I had so many cavities filled. 

In 2022 I was starting to feel mentally a bit better. I bought a sonicare toothbrush and was determined to be better about my teeth. I used the toothbrush head that came with the toothbrush (spoiler alert, it was a medium bristle one) and didn‚Äôt read the instructions so I didn‚Äôt know what the pressure sensor alerts meant. I brushed away my gums. At my next dental cleaning I was having cold sensitivity on some of my upper teeth on my right side. I didn‚Äôt know gums didn‚Äôt grow back. The hygienist was very kind and educated me about my toothbrush and said the best we can do is try to keep the recession where it is now. My mental health tumbled again and I stopped using the sonicare and went back to a soft manual toothbrush once a day. 

In fall 2023 I was told I had a couple of 4mm pockets by where my wisdom teeth used to be. I was told I really needed to floss, and they wanted to see me again in 4 months instead of 6 for another cleaning. I didn‚Äôt know how to floss and at the age of 27 I was too embarrassed to ask them to show me how. I bought a water pik since it was better than nothing. I got my pockets down to 3mm and am back to 6 month cleanings (yay me!). 

But I also had started adding zero sugar propel packets to the water I was sipping on all day. I thought I was doing such a good thing drinking water with zero sugar flavor in it. I was taking spironolactone for acne and it really dehydrated me so I was trying to add electrolytes. I didn‚Äôt read the ingredients of the propel packets. The first ingredient is citric acid. I was sipping on propel for a year all day everyday. I got 2 more cavities and had them filled a little over a month ago. 

I‚Äôm determined to be better this year. I learned how to floss with string floss! At bedtime I still use my water pik first, then use string floss. I got extra soft bristle heads for my sonicare, and I GENTLY brush twice a day and use prescription fluoride toothpaste at night after flossing (I use crest gum detoxify in the morning). I drink PLAIN WATER throughout the day and I have 1 soda a week (I drink it with my meal and try to swish with water after). I‚Äôm working on my sugar addiction. 

After my fillings my dentist told me my misaligned bite is causing my front teeth to wear down. I am getting consultations for Invisalign or braces to fix my bite and maybe even make my teeth easier to keep clean. 

In summary I want to improve my oral health. I have a dentist I trust and a fantastic therapist. I think I found an orthodontist I trust and am excited to fix my bite and straighten my teeth. And most importantly, I want to be alive. ",0,1740943947.0,PeriodontalDisease,0,0.5,False

When I broke up with you, it was the weirdest breakup I've ever had. I've never been exchanging ""I love yous"" and kissing someone during the act of breaking up. Then you asked to see me, and I readily complied. I ran in the snowy cold to the restaurant you were sitting at, that restaurant where we have spent so many nights talking until morning while I order endless decaf coffees. We acted as a couple, like nothing happened. The breakup even became somewhat of an inside joke between us, with you referencing it casually as if it was all some little farce. 

I started to see that side of you I'd fallen in love with. The playful side, who puts me first and appreciates my all-consuming type of love. You talked about me like you really loved me. That's not at all how it's been recently. You've made me feel so small and like none of my efforts mattered. 

You reassured me, in an undertone sort of way, that things will be different now. In the dizzy warmth of my mind, feeling the love I had been craving from you, I softened completely. I couldn't remember what brought me to the point of being done, and what I could remember still I didn't care about.

It was like some spell I was under. I basically begged you not to see anyone else. I'm not even thinking about seeing anyone else obviously. I only want you. I just want THAT version of you. Not the stressed out version that yells at me and tells me I'm not what you need.

I'm so confused. It was like you suddenly saw the truth of how much I've cared for you and loved you which I've wanted this whole time. I'm not sure you'll want to have a frank discussion about this. I need to have one. I love you sweetie. But I wish I could understand you better.",3,1740943914.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.8,False

I want to talk a bit about the Twin Carafe designed by John Arndt and Wonhee Jeong Arndt at Studio Gorm for Good Thing circa 2017. It's a unique brewer but it is discontinued and I want to see if there are any brewers with comparable features.

I got it as a gift about 8 years ago. I just recently started using a proper v60 instead of the built in funnel and it has really made me appreciate the genius of this simple design.

The design is a twin walled glass carafe with a silicone v60 like funnel that fits a size 02 filter. The silicone funnel has ridges that allow you to use the brewer for loose leaf tea, and also make for a pleasant pour. The twin walls allow you to comfortably pick up the brewer without a handle, and also provide a little bit of insulation for the contents.

My local coffee shop finally had a nice looking plastic v60 in stock (coffee shops almost always exclusively stock the ceramic ones), so I picked one up to see if the signature elements of the proper v60 design would make a difference in my brew. To my dismay I found that they did make for better coffee, so now I am putting a v60 on top of the carafe instead of using the built in silicone funnel.

This has made me appreciate the original design all the more. The way the silicone funnel locks into the carafe means you don't have to fuss with a wet brewer in one hand when you go to pour your coffee. No drips, no dedicated stand. It also makes it more compact sitting on the counter, as the funnel dips into the carafe. The ridges make for an exceptionally controlled, satisfying pour, and the added benefit of loose leaf tea brewing is just icing on the cake.

Now that I have been immersed in coffee culture for about a decade, I am shocked that something comparable to this design is not available from another manufacturer. It's basically a reinvention of the Chemex but with modern materials and as few parts as possible. If the silicone funnel had a more v60 like drain pattern on it it would be the perfect brewer for me.

I am posting to inject this design into the coffee culture in hopes of finding a comparable replacement, or if one doesn't exist, inspiring a manufacturer to take inspiration from it.

1j1z0ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j1z0ah/a_bear_in_the_mountains/,A Bear in the Mountains,"When Augustus McCrae came to, it was to the sound of knickering and a cold, hard breeze. The fire was reduced to a smoldering heap. His horses‚Äô eyes‚Äìilluminated by the embers‚Äìstared out toward the snowy landscape beyond the cave.  
  
‚ÄúWhat is it Nobu?‚Äù Augustus asked, placing a hand on his coal-coated steed.   
  
In place of an answer, Nobu continued looking toward the cave exit. In Augustus‚Äô opinion, his horse wasn‚Äôt like other animals. When faced with the unknown, most animals gave in to fear or intrigue. Nobu, however, held his reaction, and approached situations the same way a human would. It was that balance between curiosity and caution that had saved Augustus many times. It was that balance he chose to trust in now.  
  
He grumbled to his feet, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and shaking the soreness off his legs. The incessant traveling was beginning to take a toll. How many days had it been since he had a soft bed to lie in? A cold beer to guzzle down? Someone other than Nobu to talk to? And how many more days would he have to endure?   
  
He knew these were all meaningless questions. He had tried before, many times, to leave the past behind. Each time, something tugged at his guilt. Be it a rumour or a whisper, it yanked him until he was faced with the truth. Aki was out there. He had helped create that monster. It was only right he had to face it too.  
  
Once at the exit, Augustus stuck his head out into the bitter cold. The wind tore through the valley, whipping the snow into a frenzy and stifling the night sky in curtains of white. High above, the crescent moon peeked out of the clouds and flooded the white hellscape with a yellow haze. It illuminated the surrounding mountain peaks‚Äìand the bear standing atop one.   
  
At this range, the bear was just a brown point in the distance, yet Augustus felt unnerved. It stood eerily still. Unbothered by raging winds and ceaseless snow, it focused on only one thing. Augustus. A soft swishing proceeded Nobu as he came out of the cave to stand by Augustus. Augustus gave his tense steed one look and decided to leave.  
  
He took stock of everything he owned, which admittedly, wasn‚Äôt very much. Ammo, food, a plate, and a skillet‚Äìthese were the essentials that kept him going on the road. With most of his things packed into a saddlebag, only his weapons were left. He looked between his hunting rifle and pistol. Neither would do much to a bear except piss it off. He holstered both and turned toward his sheathed katana.   
  
The lacquered scabbard felt worn between his fingers, the glossy texture dulled by time. It had been years since he wielded the katana‚Äìeven longer since he had to. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he still could. He held it over his head, unsheathing it slowly. Inch by inch, the exposed steel sliced through the years. The endless pursuit of mastery, the bottomless pit of cruelty‚Äìmemories he had tried to bury‚Äìnow fit him like a glove. 

With a violent motion, Augustus slammed the katana back into its sheath, and the past was snuffed out.

When he stepped out again, the bear had come closer. Its eyes were still locked on him, its presence was still unnatural. Augustus bent down and tossed some snow at the fire. It sizzled and died, plunging the cave into darkness. Then, he mounted his horse.

‚ÄúCome on girl, let‚Äôs get,‚Äù Augustus clucked, and soon they were trudging through one hell to escape another.

Riding through the blizzard, Augustus shoved his hat down to his eyebrows and pulled his scarf over his nose. Neither did much good. The snow left cold stings across his cheeks and dug their way into his eyes. He‚Äôd spend a good five seconds cleaning out his vision only to be blinded again in the next breath.

This was something he didn‚Äôt need. Their tracks from earlier today‚Äìthe tracks Augustus depended on to retreat from the mountains‚Äìwere already replaced by snow. Nobu had a strong sense of direction, but with weather like this, one wrong turn was enough to rob you of your senses.

Worse yet, Augustus couldn‚Äôt keep an eye out for the bear. When his eyesight cleared, it was too dark to see without the moon. When the moon came out, his eyesight needed to be cleared again. In the rare times he had both sight and light, he saw a silhouette trailing behind. It teetered along strangely, as if something was jerking it forward.

Augustus had just about enough of this. He could be lost, he could be chased, but he could not afford to be blind. If he could get out of the storm and afford himself some visibility, his situation would vastly improve.

When he was a boy, Aki and he were constantly on the move. Jumping from camp to camp, Augustus learned how to start a fire, set up a tent, but most importantly, pick a good campsite. ‚ÄúIt can be dry and flat,‚Äù Aki would say, ‚Äúbut you have to account for the wind. It can turn even the slightest chill into a nasty night.‚Äù

Tonight was shaping up to be one of those nasty nights. Augustus held his hand up and felt the wind push up against it. The valley opened up in the same direction as the wind. What he needed was a windbreak. If the wind stopped blowing, the snow would stop moving. If the snow stopped moving, he could see more than a foot ahead.

On his right, he caught sight of a mountain peak. It blinked in and out of existence as the moon shifted between clouds. The side of a mountain would make a great windbreak, but what if the moon didn‚Äôt reappear? He‚Äôd be stranded in a sea of snow, astray of the mountain and the valley. But if he stayed on the trail, he might not make it off the mountain. He couldn‚Äôt face the bear blind. The choice was clear. With a loud ‚ÄòHYAA‚Äô, he pushed his horse on. They abandoned the path and rode off toward the mountain.

Augustus loped for a long while. The storm seemed to ease up, but the wind compensated by blowing twice as hard. The snow lost its density, and soon they were practically swimming in it. All the while, the bear‚Äôs presence began to break through.

Agonized wheezing pierced through the howling winds. When the air stilled, a sickly sweet scent wafted through. The sounds grew louder; the smells grew sharper. Augustus‚Äìcold, wet, and still blind‚Äìknew the prospect of escape was dim.

But then, he found himself rising higher and higher until his legs were plucked out of the snow. The wind didn‚Äôt scream as hard anymore, and he could see just a little bit further. A couple paces more, and he could see all the way to the clouds surrounding the mountain peak. They had escaped the storm.

Before he could enjoy that fact, he instinctively placed a hand over his mouth and blanched. That same foul scent which had come in bursts before now swamped the air around him. In addition to the wheezing, the lack of wind allowed him to hear a soft, continuous growl.

‚ÄúCOME ON GIRL,‚Äù Augustus yelled, ‚ÄúFAST AS YOU CAN!‚Äù.

Nobu charged up the side of the mountain, sending large spurts of snow behind them. Augustus fell back onto his saddle as the slopes grew steeper. They were sandwiched between two stretches of clouds. One covered the heavens. The other covered the valley. Every so often he would turn to check on the bear. Its figure remained the same size and it left a trail of‚Ä¶ something behind it. Augustus squinted, but before he could see, he was nearly bucked off as Nobu reared.

When his horse came back down, it was to the sound of a dull *crack*. At first, Augustus assumed it was just some frost. Then he saw the sheet of ice‚Äìmaybe six inches thick‚Äìand the darkness below it.

The ice sheet ran only a few feet forward, but stretched left and right as far as the eye could see, giving the mountain a long horizontal scar. Just below the ice, the walls closed in, funneling toward a narrow, bottomless abyss. Augustus looked up and saw the mountain was littered with them‚Äìdozens of crevices that cut into the belly of the mountain.

Augustus hopped off his horse and gave the ice two swift kicks. His foot bounced back as if he had struck solid ground. He leaned his weight onto the ice sheet. Again, nothing. But then, he pressed his foot over the dent Nobu made, and the ice hissed through a series of cracks. As he contemplated this, a roar erupted beyond the ridge.

Augustus reached for his katana but found he couldn‚Äôt pull it out. His grip was weak and clammy. The katana‚Äôs weight felt unbearably heavy. His chest was tight and his breathing came out too shallow and quick. To wield was to remember. Even faced with his own death, he didn‚Äôt want to remember.

Augustus assessed his options again. The ice sheets might hold Nobu‚Äôs weight‚Äìuntil they didn‚Äôt. He could riddle the bear with bullets, but that might not be enough to bring it down. He couldn‚Äôt fight. He couldn‚Äôt flee. But then he saw the dent in the ice again, and an idea struck him.

‚ÄúAlright girl,‚Äù Augustus said, grabbing a saddlebag, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for you to flee.‚Äù

Nobu didn‚Äôt move. Augustus smiled at the hesitant look his horse gave him. Life hadn‚Äôt been easy since Aki and the gang fell apart. Mostly it had just been lonesome and empty. But through it all, he at least had Nobu.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. Now go on. GET!‚Äù

With those words, and a soft slap, Nobu bolted off‚Äìfar away from bears and crevices. Augustus was left stranded on the mountain with nothing but a saddlebag. At the sound of another roar, he ran too, but further up the mountain.

Augustus scanned the ice sheets as he ran. The first few stretched only a few feet‚Äìtoo narrow for his purpose. He passed several more before he finally landed on the perfect one. Like all the others, it ran sideways across the mountains, but this one also extended wide, forming an ice covered crater.

Without wasting a second, he lifted the saddlebag over his head and slammed it down into the ice. The impact left a hexagonal ring of cracks that then broke off into a series of uneven lines. Augustus placed a foot on the dent, raising a round of fizzles, and launched himself into a sprint over the sheet. He turned around every few feet to raise the saddlebag and smash the ice. Over and over he did this until he left over a half dozen indents in the ice. Just as he reached the other side, he turned around to see the bear.

It emerged over the ridge, panting and wheezing, its features slowly coming into view. The bear kept a strange gait. It approached Augustus the same way a horse would if you forced it into a dangerous situation. It had half a mind to bolt, and it had half a mind to obey some unseen command.

A large chunk of its stomach was missing, and green pus oozed from it. It didn't just leak from its belly, but from its frothing mouth and beady eyes. It left behind a curdled trail, staining the white snow green. The smell it produced was putrid, and at this range, it made Augustus lightheaded.

The bear spotted Augustus. It rose onto its hindlegs, towering over him even from a few hundred feet away. Its empty black eyes met his, and whatever hesitation it had seemed to snap. The bear fell back down onto the snow and charged.

The bear tore through the snow, moving nearly as fast as a horse. Its paw hit the dent Nobu had made earlier, and Augustus was met with a terrible realization. The ice sheet around the bear fizzled and snapped, but before it could break, the bear was already a few feet closer. It might not linger long enough for his plan to work.

Augustus lifted his saddlebag and brought it down into the ice. The ice gave a small *pop*, but still held its structure. He brought it down again. The ice buckled some more, but still didn‚Äôt break. The bear was only two hundred feet away. Augustus thrusted the bag with his entire body. The latches came clean off and his things‚Äìammo, food, a skillet, a coffee pot‚Äì skittered over the ice.

The bear was on the other side of the ice sheet and in full sprint. Augustus tossed aside the bag and began pummeling the ice with his bare hands. The sides of his palm turned numb and his vision turned watery. His consciousness was nothing more than the stench, the wheezing, and the ice. His hands were probably bloody and raw by now, but still he struck the ice, until-

A thin stream of ice shot out from under him. It flew past the bear, connecting with another indent he made. From there, it shot out again, going from one indent to another until it reached the other side of the sheet. For a moment, Augustus felt everything go still around him‚Äì the bear, the ice, the air, his breath. And then, the ground fell apart.

Chunks of ice cascaded down the pit. It started from the center split, but quickly swallowed both sides of the ice sheet. The bear, too wrapped up in its fury to notice, lunged at Augustus. Augustus leapt backward, narrowly avoiding a swipe from the bear‚Äôs claw. The ice sheet had completely collapsed, and the bear was teetering on the edge with nothing but an ice wall to hold on to.

Unable to hold the bear‚Äôs weight, the ice came apart and the bear slipped twenty feet before it could get a grip again. Augustus leaned over the edge and stared down the bear. Its eyes were still devoid and fixated on him‚Äìuntil a look came over it. The bear looked away from Augustus and worriedly at its surroundings. It clung to the wall desperately and gave soft cries of panic. It looked less like a monster now, and more like a scared wild animal. And yet, monster or not, it lost its grip and disappeared all the same.

Augustus, now tired beyond belief, fell back into the snow and closed his eyes.",1,1740943432.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

**42. Lisa Frankenstein - 3.75/10**

Great aesthetics, but a total mess. Felt like three different scripts mashed together. Incomprehensible character arcs. Really enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so, which made the second and third acts all the more disappointing and confusing.

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10**

An Instagram reel worth of info spread out across 2 hours.

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10**

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it‚Äôs never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it‚Äôs a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10**

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to¬†*12 Angry Men*, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn‚Äôt find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10**

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn‚Äôt even know how a number of the words she‚Äôs speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film‚Äôs at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10**

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10**

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You‚Äôd have thought the studio would have noticed that the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to protect the hive‚Äù was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It‚Äôs a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10**

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you‚Äôre into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10**

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going ‚Äúoh, I get that‚Äù way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn‚Äôt really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the¬†*Oldboy*¬†hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think¬†*Deadpool‚Äôs*¬†not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10**

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial ‚Äúso random‚Äù kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found¬†*A Monster Calls*¬†to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10**

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an ‚Äúimportant‚Äù movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn‚Äôt feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I‚Äôd say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10**

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can‚Äôt overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs so high octane, there‚Äôs not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy¬†*Michael Bay*¬†horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando*¬†‚Äúshowy‚Äù style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10**

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from¬†*Fury Road*. This would have been a solid ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on TNT, let‚Äôs just throw it on‚Äù kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10**

Nick Cage‚Äôs character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10**

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively.

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where¬†*Anna Kendrick*¬†is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment. The main character's someone with modern values who gets to clap back at the bad guys, which I find to be a fairly common - if not quite manipulative - way to make the audience feel like the good guy without delving deeper into why things were the way they were in that time. There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from¬†*Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10**

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn‚Äôt pick any.Monica Bellucci‚Äôs role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

**25. My Old Ass - 7.25/10**

Sweet little movie. Fun premise and great performances. Not enough forward momentum.

**24. Hundreds of Beavers - 7.25/10**

Some very fun and funny stuff, but I would have enjoyed it more as a short than as a feature. There‚Äôs a reason¬†*Looney Tunes*¬†cartoons aren‚Äôt two hours long.Always fun seeing the novel ways indie filmmakers can work around low budgets.

**23. The Wild Robot - 7.5/10**

Pretty good. Felt very much like a children‚Äôs flick, which it is, but didn‚Äôt transcend those bounds in the way that a¬†*Monsters Inc.*¬†or¬†*Toy Story*¬†do.All about not fitting in and being yourself, which is basically every children‚Äôs movie. Might just be that I‚Äôm old and cranky.

**22. Oddity - 7.5/10**

Solid horror movie with an A+ beginning. Some really creepy imagery.

**21. Didi - 7.5/10**

Good coming-of-age flick, but I don‚Äôt love coming-of-age movies. Clearly very personal to the director. Didn‚Äôt resonate as much with me.

**20. Late Night with the Devil - 7.5/10**

Fun horror flick with a pretty unique setting. Maybe a bit milquetoast, but overall enjoyable.

**19. Kinds of Kindness - 7.75/10**

Three short films. Might have enjoyed them more individually, as they start to run together a bit. Quite funny and very weird.

**18. I Brake for Caterpillars - 8/10**

Great dark comedy written and directed by my chess buddy, Ken Green.

**17. Dune: Part Two - 8/10**

Beautiful visuals; really does feel epic. I think this movie would work better if viewed immediately after¬†*Part One*, as it can sort of take your breath away with how constant the action is.On its own, it feels like a theme park ride more than it does a film; again, an issue that goes away if marathoned. Villains felt shallow.

**16. Hit Man - 8/10**

Very fun. Glen Powell oozes charisma. Great range too, came away very impressed by him.Felt like there were some tonal issues where it didn‚Äôt know if it wanted to be serious or silly. Quite enjoyable overall.

**15. Caddo Lake - 8/10**

A puzzle to put together as much as it is a movie. Little context for what‚Äôs happening until about an hour through, which made it hard to really feel invested in what was going on. It was very well executed and an interesting premise/mystery, but it does take some concentration, and it was easy to get overwhelmed or confused. The character work all felt great and real.

**14. In the Land of Saints & Sinners - 8/10**

Great¬†*Liam Neeson*¬†action (adjacent) flick. I saw a lot of parallels between this and¬†*Unforgiven*, though this movie was quite a bit softer.Neeson can chew scenery like no other, and Joffrey was great too. Feel like I can see him being a more buttoned-up¬†*Barry Keoghan*¬†type. Could have used a better group of villains and did feel a bit slow in spots.Surprised by how beautiful this movie was to look at and how much care they put into composition.

**13. A Different Man - 8.25/10**

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle¬†*Lynchian*¬†stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10**

Wonderfully tense.¬†*James McAvoy*¬†may be the best working actor today.Really interesting premise, explores how people are so willing to be polite that they‚Äôll ignore very obvious red flags so as not to ruffle feathers. Really enjoyed the twists and turns (which are totally ruined if you watch the trailer).Feels like logic flies out the window a bit towards the end. One of our protagonists comes out seeming cartoonishly competent and the other cartoonishly incompetent.Curious now to watch the 2022 original.

**11. Strange Darling - 8.25/10**

Absolutely love the style. Twisted and twisty; keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I love the way that - from the very beginning - the structure makes you feel off balance (the film says it‚Äôs 5 chapters and then starts with chapter 3).Female lead was fantastic. Very weak final twenty minutes or so. Not sure if I agree with the film‚Äôs overall message/politics.

**10. The First Omen - 8.25/10**

Very effective satanic horror flick with some really disturbing and interesting set pieces. Legitimately creepy; on par with the original in that regard.Could have benefited from cutting about 30 minutes towards the end. The final act suffers from showing too much and not leaving enough to the imagination.The end was the only section that really felt overtly ‚Äúfan-servicey,‚Äù but it was so overt and awkward that it felt like a post-credit scene in a¬†*Marvel*¬†movie‚Äîvery weird and silly in this context.Overall, a very good movie that could have been a classic if they had just chopped off the final act.

**9. The Substance - 8.5/10**

Very fun body horror flick, led by a great performance by¬†*Demi Moore*. Very interesting concept.I didn‚Äôt feel it in the moment, but I can see how there are moments that could be really emotionally resonant for certain people watching‚Äîall about an unwillingness to deal with aging and the pain that comes with fading beauty. Love how disgusting the camera work makes everything feel. The close-ups of¬†*Dennis Quaid*¬†eating may have been the grossest parts of a very gross body-horror movie.Really interesting how the film satirizes ‚Äúsex sells‚Äù by making the sexual imagery SO over the top. They do some interesting stuff at the end, but I do think it could have used some editing down.The final act of the film lost a fair bit of momentum due to being so drawn out. I‚Äôm also tired of the ‚Äúeverything devolves into violence‚Äù trope; feels like a cop-out at this point.

**8. Wicked: Part One - 8.5/10**

Didn‚Äôt really want to see it; I saw it on stage and thought it was just okay. Thought it was quite slow to start, but was totally invested by the end.Loved the look and effects. Didn‚Äôt feel stretched out. The pauses in the songs all felt natural and cinematic to me. Don‚Äôt love the music overall, but a few stood out. *Ariana Grande‚Äôs*¬†a great comic actress, and the woman playing¬†*Elphaba*¬†has one of the more expressive faces I‚Äôve seen; she was the perfect actress to get you to feel what she was feeling. A spectacle.

**7. Conclave - 8.75/10**

Very well acted and shot. Not high art, but a super entertaining/fun political thriller.A lot of the conflict in the film felt small in a way that made everything feel much more grounded and real. I did appreciate the messaging, even if some of the moralizing could feel on the nose.Excited to watch this one again.

**6. Baby Reindeer - 9/10 (Limited series that felt like a 4-hour movie, so here it goes)**

Loved how raw this felt. Not a conventional story at all with a uniquely imperfect protagonist.Its four-hour runtime really does allow it the space to make what might feel corny or melodramatic in a 90-minute film feel earned and heartbreaking in this one.Incredible performances all around.¬†*Courtney*¬†and I were glued to the screen the whole time.

**5. I Saw the TV Glow - 9/10**

A movie I enjoyed thinking about as much‚Äîor more‚Äîthan I enjoyed actually watching. Profound. Presents likely the best metaphor I‚Äôve come across for existential dread and living through a life you‚Äôre not supposed to. Maybe transgenderism?(Later edit: I‚Äôve since read that the director is trans and explicitly says that it is about the trans experience.)Very open to interpretation; stayed with me for weeks. Some really stunning visuals. Could have dull moments, but much more than the sum of its parts once it all comes together and likely the most important movie I will see this year.

**4. A Real Pain - 9.25/10**

A fairly typical road-trip dramedy that feels very¬†*Odd Couple meets Garden State*¬†until about halfway through, at which point it becomes something new. In one of the more powerful single scenes I‚Äôve watched, all of those genre tropes are suddenly shifted and subverted, and it becomes a uniquely vulnerable look into the psyche of the magnetic/difficult personality type.*A Real Pain*¬†chooses to look at its characters with a seriousness and introspection that‚Äôs really uncommon. Maybe a little too much Chopin‚Äîgot distracting.

**3. Red Rooms - 9.25/10**

One of the most physically uncomfortable thrillers I‚Äôve ever watched, with one of the all-time most disturbing single scenes‚Äîall the more noteworthy that it‚Äôs done without actual violence or gore depicted.An exploration of how dehumanizing and perverse true crime as a genre and hobby can get.

**2. It‚Äôs What‚Äôs Inside - 9.25/10**

Has a distinct pop aesthetic that feels very ‚Äúof today‚Äù and exciting. Incredibly stylish and fun.Kind of a low-brow concept on paper, but it‚Äôs taken as far‚Äîand in as many directions‚Äîas you could imagine it could be.Doesn‚Äôt take the easy, low-hanging fruit to engage your interest. On paper, the plot and premise are quite complicated, so it‚Äôs impressive just how easy it all is to follow in practice.

**1. Anora - 9.5/10**

Might be a perfect movie. Begins beautiful and idyllic‚Äîlike a music video suddenly becoming reality‚Äîand turns into something equal parts heart-wrenching and hilarious; a wildly entertaining deconstruction of a fairy tale.*Sean Baker‚Äôs*¬†most traditionally staged film‚Äîdefinitely not shot on an iPhone this time‚Äîbut still doesn‚Äôt lose the soul that his grittier pictures have.Great naturalistic dialog that allows the chemistry of the cast to take center stage. Love how¬†*Baker*¬†shines a light on people on the margins of society without judgment; he doesn‚Äôt glorify‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt¬†*Pretty Woman*‚Äîbut he doesn‚Äôt cast stones.

1j1yyy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1j1yyy9/things_ive_learned_from_85_days_of_gcgc/,Things I‚Äôve learned from 85 days of GCGC,"Okay so I‚Äôm not like always the most quick on the uptake and a lot/all of what I‚Äôm about to say can probably be found in other spots in the sub (since I definitely discovered troubleshooting solutions to a lot of the issues I ran into on this sub). 


1. Steaming Milk
    
     There‚Äôs some great guides on this sub for how to do it and I recommend checking those out. On a most basic level, keep the cup at the lowest point with the light blue icon until it gets steamed all the way (usually, at least once, during this process you need to slightly lower it again), as soon as it clears into the section that‚Äôs highlighted, pull the cup up so that both the vertical and horizontal bars increase into the highlighted sections. 

Also, there are days when you‚Äôll have the goal of steaming milk perfectly twice and you won‚Äôt have two customers coming in who want a latte. If I have a day where I‚Äôve got the steamed milk goal, I‚Äôll do one early in the day and just leave it there for a potential customer. You can always toss this and make a second steamed milk towards the end of the day to meet the goal. 

2. At the end of every day, go to the equipment section and check if you need to repair your grinder or coffee machine. My drink quality/customer satisfaction went up after I started making a point to do this. 

3. Get the measuring cup line marker upgrade. Iced/cold drinks will be so much less likely to cause you to issue refunds if you do this. 

4. Please don‚Äôt do what I did and not collect your daily rewards. I‚Äôm pretty sure I wouldn‚Äôt just be in level 7 if I had realized that you have to click on main menu/main page from where you are in the shop page at the end of the level and then click on the my pad from there to collect rewards. Lowkey contemplating starting over on my iPad (I still haven‚Äôt been able to get a code sent to my email to cloud save) even though I won‚Äôt necessarily have the items I‚Äôve purchased just to see how much faster I would have progressed, if I‚Äôd collected those daily rewards the first like 3ish days I played. 

5. I know people are complaining about how hard things are, but I promise that with time, buying the upgrades, and making sure you repair your machines, it definitely makes it easier (making 3 lattes is always a pain, but it gets a little better once your machine is upgraded to the 3 spots). 

6. A little bit of an obvious one, but I didn‚Äôt realize at first until I asked. If they say they want a creamy espresso/latte/americano, they want a dollop of whipped cream on top. If they say they want it topped with a strawberry or chocolate chips, then you need to do a dollop of whipped cream and then either the chocolate chips or the strawberry. Also, put your syrup (chocolate/vanilla/strawberry) in first. It won‚Äôt go in a warm latte, if you do the milk first (you can do the espresso and the syrup if you want though). 

If I think of any other things, I‚Äôll add them. I hope this helps someone else!

**42. Lisa Frankenstein - 3.75/10** 

Great aesthetics, but a total mess. Felt like three different scripts mashed together. Incomprehensible character arcs. Really enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so, which made the second and third acts all the more disappointing and confusing.

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10** 

An Instagram reel worth of info spread out across 2 hours.

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10** 

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it‚Äôs never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it‚Äôs a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10** 

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to¬†*12 Angry Men*, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn‚Äôt find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10** 

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn‚Äôt even know how a number of the words she‚Äôs speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film‚Äôs at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10** 

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10** 

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You‚Äôd have thought the studio would have noticed that the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to protect the hive‚Äù was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It‚Äôs a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10** 

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you‚Äôre into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10** 

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going ‚Äúoh, I get that‚Äù way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn‚Äôt really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the¬†*Oldboy*¬†hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think¬†*Deadpool‚Äôs*¬†not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10** 

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial ‚Äúso random‚Äù kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found¬†*A Monster Calls*¬†to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10** 

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an ‚Äúimportant‚Äù movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn‚Äôt feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I‚Äôd say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10** 

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can‚Äôt overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs so high octane, there‚Äôs not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy¬†*Michael Bay*¬†horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando*¬†‚Äúshowy‚Äù style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10** 

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from¬†*Fury Road*. This would have been a solid ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on TNT, let‚Äôs just throw it on‚Äù kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10** 

Nick Cage‚Äôs character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10** 

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively. 

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where¬†*Anna Kendrick*¬†is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment.

There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from¬†*Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10** 

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn‚Äôt pick any.Monica Bellucci‚Äôs role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle¬†*Lynchian*¬†stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10** 

Wonderfully tense.¬†*James McAvoy*¬†may be the best working actor today.Really interesting premise, explores how people are so willing to be polite that they‚Äôll ignore very obvious red flags so as not to ruffle feathers. Really enjoyed the twists and turns (which are totally ruined if you watch the trailer).Feels like logic flies out the window a bit towards the end. One of our protagonists comes out seeming cartoonishly competent and the other cartoonishly incompetent.Curious now to watch the 2022 original.

**11. Strange Darling - 8.25/10** 

Absolutely love the style. Twisted and twisty; keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I love the way that - from the very beginning - the structure makes you feel off balance (the film says it‚Äôs 5 chapters and then starts with chapter 3).Female lead was fantastic. Very weak final twenty minutes or so. Not sure if I agree with the film‚Äôs overall message/politics.

**10. The First Omen - 8.25/10** 

Very effective satanic horror flick with some really disturbing and interesting set pieces. Legitimately creepy; on par with the original in that regard.Could have benefited from cutting about 30 minutes towards the end. The final act suffers from showing too much and not leaving enough to the imagination.The end was the only section that really felt overtly ‚Äúfan-servicey,‚Äù but it was so overt and awkward that it felt like a post-credit scene in a¬†*Marvel*¬†movie‚Äîvery weird and silly in this context.Overall, a very good movie that could have been a classic if they had just chopped off the final act.

**9. The Substance - 8.5/10** 

Very fun body horror flick, led by a great performance by¬†*Demi Moore*. Very interesting concept.I didn‚Äôt feel it in the moment, but I can see how there are moments that could be really emotionally resonant for certain people watching‚Äîall about an unwillingness to deal with aging and the pain that comes with fading beauty. Love how disgusting the camera work makes everything feel. The close-ups of¬†*Dennis Quaid*¬†eating may have been the grossest parts of a very gross body-horror movie.Really interesting how the film satirizes ‚Äúsex sells‚Äù by making the sexual imagery SO over the top. They do some interesting stuff at the end, but I do think it could have used some editing down.The final act of the film lost a fair bit of momentum due to being so drawn out. I‚Äôm also tired of the ‚Äúeverything devolves into violence‚Äù trope; feels like a cop-out at this point.

**8. Wicked: Part One - 8.5/10** 

Didn‚Äôt really want to see it; I saw it on stage and thought it was just okay. Thought it was quite slow to start, but was totally invested by the end.Loved the look and effects. Didn‚Äôt feel stretched out. The pauses in the songs all felt natural and cinematic to me. Don‚Äôt love the music overall, but a few stood out. *Ariana Grande‚Äôs*¬†a great comic actress, and the woman playing¬†*Elphaba*¬†has one of the more expressive faces I‚Äôve seen; she was the perfect actress to get you to feel what she was feeling. A spectacle.

**7. Conclave - 8.75/10** 

Very well acted and shot. Not high art, but a super entertaining/fun political thriller.A lot of the conflict in the film felt small in a way that made everything feel much more grounded and real. I did appreciate the messaging, even if some of the moralizing could feel on the nose.Excited to watch this one again.

**6. Baby Reindeer - 9/10 (Limited series that felt like a 4-hour movie, so here it goes)** 

Loved how raw this felt. Not a conventional story at all with a uniquely imperfect protagonist.Its four-hour runtime really does allow it the space to make what might feel corny or melodramatic in a 90-minute film feel earned and heartbreaking in this one.Incredible performances all around.¬†*Courtney*¬†and I were glued to the screen the whole time.

**5. I Saw the TV Glow - 9/10** 

A movie I enjoyed thinking about as much‚Äîor more‚Äîthan I enjoyed actually watching. Profound. Presents likely the best metaphor I‚Äôve come across for existential dread and living through a life you‚Äôre not supposed to. Maybe transgenderism?(Later edit: I‚Äôve since read that the director is trans and explicitly says that it is about the trans experience.)Very open to interpretation; stayed with me for weeks. Some really stunning visuals. Could have dull moments, but much more than the sum of its parts once it all comes together and likely the most important movie I will see this year.

**4. A Real Pain - 9.25/10** 

A fairly typical road-trip dramedy that feels very¬†*Odd Couple meets Garden State*¬†until about halfway through, at which point it becomes something new. In one of the more powerful single scenes I‚Äôve watched, all of those genre tropes are suddenly shifted and subverted, and it becomes a uniquely vulnerable look into the psyche of the magnetic/difficult personality type.*A Real Pain*¬†chooses to look at its characters with a seriousness and introspection that‚Äôs really uncommon. Maybe a little too much Chopin‚Äîgot distracting.

**3. Red Rooms - 9.25/10** 

One of the most physically uncomfortable thrillers I‚Äôve ever watched, with one of the all-time most disturbing single scenes‚Äîall the more noteworthy that it‚Äôs done without actual violence or gore depicted.An exploration of how dehumanizing and perverse true crime as a genre and hobby can get.

**2. It‚Äôs What‚Äôs Inside - 9.25/10** 

Has a distinct pop aesthetic that feels very ‚Äúof today‚Äù and exciting. Incredibly stylish and fun.Kind of a low-brow concept on paper, but it‚Äôs taken as far‚Äîand in as many directions‚Äîas you could imagine it could be.Doesn‚Äôt take the easy, low-hanging fruit to engage your interest. On paper, the plot and premise are quite complicated, so it‚Äôs impressive just how easy it all is to follow in practice.

**1. Anora - 9.5/10** 

Might be a perfect movie. Begins beautiful and idyllic‚Äîlike a music video suddenly becoming reality‚Äîand turns into something equal parts heart-wrenching and hilarious; a wildly entertaining deconstruction of a fairy tale.*Sean Baker‚Äôs*¬†most traditionally staged film‚Äîdefinitely not shot on an iPhone this time‚Äîbut still doesn‚Äôt lose the soul that his grittier pictures have.Great naturalistic dialog that allows the chemistry of the cast to take center stage. Love how¬†*Baker*¬†shines a light on people on the margins of society without judgment; he doesn‚Äôt glorify‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt¬†*Pretty Woman*‚Äîbut he doesn‚Äôt cast stones.

**42. Lisa Frankenstein - 3.75/10** 

Great aesthetics, but a total mess. Felt like three different scripts mashed together. Incomprehensible character arcs. Really enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so, which made the second and third acts all the more disappointing and confusing.

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10** 

An Instagram reel worth of info spread out across 2 hours.

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10** 

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it‚Äôs never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it‚Äôs a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10** 

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to¬†*12 Angry Men*, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn‚Äôt find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10** 

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn‚Äôt even know how a number of the words she‚Äôs speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film‚Äôs at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10** 

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10** 

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You‚Äôd have thought the studio would have noticed that the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to protect the hive‚Äù was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It‚Äôs a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10** 

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you‚Äôre into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10** 

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going ‚Äúoh, I get that‚Äù way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn‚Äôt really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the¬†*Oldboy*¬†hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think¬†*Deadpool‚Äôs*¬†not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10** 

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial ‚Äúso random‚Äù kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found¬†*A Monster Calls*¬†to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10** 

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an ‚Äúimportant‚Äù movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn‚Äôt feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I‚Äôd say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10** 

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can‚Äôt overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs so high octane, there‚Äôs not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy¬†*Michael Bay*¬†horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando*¬†‚Äúshowy‚Äù style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10** 

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from¬†*Fury Road*. This would have been a solid ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on TNT, let‚Äôs just throw it on‚Äù kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10** 

Nick Cage‚Äôs character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10** 

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively. 

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where¬†*Anna Kendrick*¬†is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment. The main character's someone with modern values who gets to clap back at the bad guys, which I find to be a fairly common - if not quite manipulative - way to make the audience feel like the good guy without delving deeper into why things were the way they were in that time. There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from¬†*Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10** 

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn‚Äôt pick any.Monica Bellucci‚Äôs role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

**25. My Old Ass - 7.25/10** 

Sweet little movie. Fun premise and great performances. Not enough forward momentum.

**24. Hundreds of Beavers - 7.25/10** 

Some very fun and funny stuff, but I would have enjoyed it more as a short than as a feature. There‚Äôs a reason¬†*Looney Tunes*¬†cartoons aren‚Äôt two hours long.Always fun seeing the novel ways indie filmmakers can work around low budgets.

**23. The Wild Robot - 7.5/10** 

Pretty good. Felt very much like a children‚Äôs flick, which it is, but didn‚Äôt transcend those bounds in the way that a¬†*Monsters Inc.*¬†or¬†*Toy Story*¬†do.All about not fitting in and being yourself, which is basically every children‚Äôs movie. Might just be that I‚Äôm old and cranky.

**22. Oddity - 7.5/10** 

Solid horror movie with an A+ beginning. Some really creepy imagery.

**21. Didi - 7.5/10** 

Good coming-of-age flick, but I don‚Äôt love coming-of-age movies. Clearly very personal to the director. Didn‚Äôt resonate as much with me.

**20. Late Night with the Devil - 7.5/10** 

Fun horror flick with a pretty unique setting. Maybe a bit milquetoast, but overall enjoyable.

**19. Kinds of Kindness - 7.75/10** 

Three short films. Might have enjoyed them more individually, as they start to run together a bit. Quite funny and very weird.

**18. I Brake for Caterpillars - 8/10**

Great dark comedy written and directed by my chess buddy, Ken Green.

**17. Dune: Part Two - 8/10**

Beautiful visuals; really does feel epic. I think this movie would work better if viewed immediately after¬†*Part One*, as it can sort of take your breath away with how constant the action is.On its own, it feels like a theme park ride more than it does a film; again, an issue that goes away if marathoned. Villains felt shallow.

**16. Hit Man - 8/10** 

Very fun. Glen Powell oozes charisma. Great range too, came away very impressed by him.Felt like there were some tonal issues where it didn‚Äôt know if it wanted to be serious or silly. Quite enjoyable overall.

**15. Caddo Lake - 8/10** 

A puzzle to put together as much as it is a movie. Little context for what‚Äôs happening until about an hour through, which made it hard to really feel invested in what was going on. It was very well executed and an interesting premise/mystery, but it does take some concentration, and it was easy to get overwhelmed or confused. The character work all felt great and real.

**14. In the Land of Saints & Sinners - 8/10** 

Great¬†*Liam Neeson*¬†action (adjacent) flick. I saw a lot of parallels between this and¬†*Unforgiven*, though this movie was quite a bit softer.Neeson can chew scenery like no other, and Joffrey was great too. Feel like I can see him being a more buttoned-up¬†*Barry Keoghan*¬†type. Could have used a better group of villains and did feel a bit slow in spots.Surprised by how beautiful this movie was to look at and how much care they put into composition.

**13. A Different Man - 8.25/10** 

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle¬†*Lynchian*¬†stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10**

I'm really so scared 
I'm really scared of sharing this
Idk if it's the right thing
And i don't know if anyone ever would understand..but it's something that i always wanted to talk about 
Over and over again 
And i don't know why

Hello, my name is Aletta!
I am 3 years old!

Well, I am completely alone, and I hide this personality and thought and desire from everyone

I don‚Äôt have any friends I can talk to about this.
But usually that doesn‚Äôt bother me because I don‚Äôt really like writing or constant communication it's hard and all what i do all the time is dreaming and playing!
I always make mistakes when writing and rely on a ai, haha sorry!

Being little is fun!
But sometimes, I really want to talk a little.
I want someone to care about me a little to just hear me..i want to feel something..

But I‚Äôm afraid of people.

Anyway, I have a story I want to share.
I don‚Äôt know if anyone will care at all.

I‚Äôve learned about shifting realities!

And it's was so cool! If i could ever be the girl that live in my dreams i will be the happiest!

When I learned about it, I felt happy,
and I thought, 'I want to go to a world where I have a smaller, more beautiful body and truly be three years old!'

But I also want a father‚Äînot just any father, I want love!

So, I created a whole story! Uh a script!

It's actually the same thing i always have scenario about, i know it's might be a bad story in this life but it's just about me ,no one else only me , so i think it's okay?

I didn‚Äôt share it with anyone because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to be upset with me.
I just want someone to understand me.

 I want to talk to someone.

I want to share it with you!

Before I tell you the story I always dreamed about, I want you to understand me a little.
There are things in this story that you might not like, and I‚Äôm sorry.
I‚Äôve been through things in my life that i don't really want to talk about it but you might understand once you read the story..

I‚Äôd been following Bryan Johnson‚Äôs journey for about a year and found it super interesting. I went in with an open mind‚Äîat the very least, I figured I‚Äôd be around some cool people all trying to be healthier.

I got the regular entry pass (not VIP), and when I checked in, I noticed the event badge had a spot on the back for your biological age test results. First thing I saw? A typo‚Äî*waste* instead of *waist*. Not a big deal, just funny.

We started by checking out the vendors‚Äîprobably 15-20 booths‚Äîselling everything from alternative toothpaste to ""healthier"" coffee to a ton of red light therapy gadgets. I asked one vendor how much it cost to have a booth there, and they said $28K for the day. If Bryan endorsed their product? Over $80K. No clue if that‚Äôs true, but it definitely surprised me.

Then came the main presentation with Bryan and his trainer. They had a slideshow and told us not to take pictures because they‚Äôd email the slides afterward. Well, it‚Äôs been a month, and‚Ä¶ still no slides. Some of the content was interesting, and Bryan adjusted based on the audience‚Äôs energy‚Äîwhen people started zoning out, he switched things up. Then, out of nowhere‚Äîlunch break.

And that‚Äôs when things went sideways.

Lunch was a mess. It had serious *Fyre Fest cheese sandwich* energy. There were four tables with boxed lunches (in plastic containers, ironically, after Bryan just talked about how bad plastic is). The options? Veggie, tofu, or steak. Everyone wanted steak. They ran out fast. People were bouncing between random lines trying to find one. I waited it out and managed to grab one when they brought out five more.

The food itself? Fine. But there were no seats, so everyone just sat on the floor eating (I‚Äôm guessing VIPs had a different setup). Lunch ran long, so people just wandered back to the vendor booths before the next session.

When we got back, Bryan took audience questions and even brought up his parents, who are both following his *Blueprint* plan. Cool in theory, but‚Ä¶ they looked exactly their age.

Then, about an hour and a half in, right in the middle of a question, a random band started playing, and it turned into a singalong. Super weird. After that, I thought about doing the Biological Age test but skipped it‚Äîit seemed pretty basic. And there was *zero* chance I was sticking around for the sober rave. Later, I saw a tweet of Bryan dancing shirtless. Again, weird.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad I went‚Äîit was definitely an experience. But honestly? The whole thing was kind of a mess. And the more I follow Bryan, the more I feel like, sure, some of this is great, but at the end of the day, he‚Äôs just monetizing his own fitness journey. Would I buy his products, use his *Don't Die* app, or donate to his next big idea (supposedly launching this spring)? Zero chance.

Also, I still can‚Äôt get over the fact that they told us not to take pictures of the slides because they‚Äôd send them out‚Ä¶ and then never did. We even emailed his company, and they basically said, ""Bryan hasn‚Äôt sent them to us yet, but when he does, we‚Äôll send them out."" So weird.

Did anyone else attend and have a different experience? Would love to hear it.",1,1740942828.0,u_Fit_Handle3334,0,1.0,False

The show dramatizes real events but basically follows the stories of two influencers promoting ‚Äúalternative‚Äù cancer therapies based on diet that end up being very dangerous and ineffective. One of the influencers travels to something called the ‚ÄúHirsch Institute‚Äù in Mexico, which promotes Gerson ‚Äútherapy.‚Äù Gerson (which is a real thing and not just an invention for the show) prescribes a diet based entirely on cold pressed juices and coffee enemas to ‚Äústarve‚Äù the cancer. The protocol and language used to describe Gerson therapy was eerily similar to the language Brooks used and made me think he was actually promoting this same ‚Äútreatment.‚Äù It is implied in ‚ÄúApple Cider Vinegar‚Äù that the Hirsch Institute used ‚Äúbrand ambassadors‚Äù to promote their methods (unsure if this is true) and I got the impression there might even be a direct sales/MLM element (we haven‚Äôt finished the series). If there is in fact a sales element, this might support the theory that Brooks and Vicki were planing to monetize Brooks‚Äô ‚Äúcancer journey‚Äù and sell the Gerson therapy system as there is already some infrastructure for this.

Thing is, we work across each other, so we have to see each other every day. I pretty much ignored her for 2 weeks. I do visit their shop since that's where I get my coffee from. I would catch her looking at me and we would end up having long eye contact. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, she comes up to me and tells me she loves me and she's over her fears of loving someone, and as a sign of commitment she proposed to me. Taking this as a sign of progress on her part, I bit the bullet. Yesterday, before leaving work, as a sign of my own commitment, I got her a simple ring. She ecstatic and almost fainted, let me put it on her with a big grin on her face.

Today, the very next day, she made her coworker give me back the ring, when I talked to her about it she was like a complete different person, cold, angry, acting like i'm her nemesis, again, just like the last time. She won't explain why and refuses to talk to me.

I just sent her a text saying all the things that SHE chose to do. She came back to me, she gave me her hand, she was the one who proposed to me, she was the one who accepted my ring, and that I'm tired of this pull&push game and that I give up.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. Everything for the first 1.5 years was absolutely amazing, but now I find myself getting frustrated with him over minor things that spark arguments like him being too loud in a quiet coffee shop, or when my parents are  sleeping at midnight, etc. 

I no longer feel that excited to see him. My friend says maybe we are spending too much time together, but we see each other maybe 3 nights a week, and don't text throughout the day since we both work. I also am not as attracted to him as before, probably because we are too comfortable around each other. 

Is it nornal to feel more frustrated/less excited? I know we care a lot about each other and he is very sincere, so I don't want to break up with him because he has all of the qualities I look for in a partner. 

We are planning to move in together this summer, is this worth mentioning to him? Or should I try to figure my feelings out alone?

The pepper and spice ramp down and it gets darker and heavier.
Dark Chocolate joins in with mild licorice on the finish.

Took it to the nub, where it started to get a little bitter and tar flavored.

This section should not just discuss the features and benefits of your solution, it must also clearly explain the uniqueness, innovation and/or novelty in how your product or service is designed and functions.***

The PI stuttered severely when he was younger. His company developed technology that alters auditory processing to treat speech disorders. When he studied Russian at the University of Colorado, he experienced disordered auditory processing when listening to foreign speech. He got A‚Äôs in the classes, which taught reading and writing, but when he traveled to foreign countries he couldn‚Äôt understand native speakers and they couldn‚Äôt understand him.

At universities, spoken fluency lags one or two semesters behind written fluency. 65% of French majors can read and write French when they graduate but only 18% can speak French fluently.

  
A journalist wrote an article about a Peruvian graduate student who spoke twenty languages. The journalist accompanied the graduate student to Malta. Maltese is derived from extinct Sicilian Arabic. The first day, the graduate student went to a coffee shop and listened to conversations. The next day, he started talking to people. By the end of the week, he was fluent in Maltese, without opening a dictionary or grammar book.

Neuroscientists then scanned his brain.

Brain imaging showed that adult polyglots have normal activity in their left hemisphere (LH) language networks when listening to foreign speech. In contrast, adult neurotypicals have a storm of neural activity. Listening to foreign speech elicits increasing neural activity, until the person‚Äôs capacity is reached. Then the LH language network shuts down and learning ceases. Foreign speech becomes a firehose of gibberish. Trying harder doesn‚Äôt help.

Polyglots have efficient auditory processing. They listen to foreign speech and hear words and phrases, without becoming overwhelmed.

This leads to two questions about the rest of us:

\- Can a spoken language be taught in a way that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm a neurotypical learner‚Äôs LH language network?

\- Can we improve LH language network efficiency, giving neurotypicals the superpowers of polyglots?

Several observations suggest answers.

First, polyglots have preternatural L2 speech perception, or the ability to hear a foreign language as words and phrases. L2 courses and apps don‚Äôt teach speech perception, except fourth-year phonetics courses where language majors say that the language ‚Äúclicks‚Äù and they can understand native speakers.

Second, phonemes, including segmentals, such as vowels and consonants, and suprasegmentals, such as stresses, tones, and durations, are the smallest units of a language. Teaching a language phonetically won‚Äôt overwhelm a learner.

Third, word and phrase segmentation from the audio stream is not taught in courses or apps. This project cuts videos and podcasts into sentences. The learner then clicks the audio player to hear one word at a time, produced by a clear computer-generated voice, adjustable for accent, gender, and speed. The learner sees a phoneme chart for the language. The keyboard is eschewed because typing leads to correct spelling and incorrect pronunciation.

The learner listens to a word, clicks the phonemes they heard, and then pronounces the word. When the user has correctly perceived and pronounced each word, they pronounce the sentence.

It‚Äôs a wonderful feeling to see a foreign word, listen to it, click the phonemes one heard, then pronounce the word and the speech-to-text engine displays the same word. You feel that you can speak the language, even if you only said one word, and that learning a language by ear may be easier than learning to read and write the language.

Briefly Describe the Technical Objectives and Challenges: Up to 3500 characters describing the R&D work to be done in a Phase I project, including the highest-risk research challenges to be investigated in a Phase I effort that are specific to your innovation. This section should also include a brief description of your unique scientific approach to solving those challenges and how this would lead to a sustainable competitive advantage for the company. Please note that challenges common to an industry or market are not responsive in this section.***

This project will research whether High Variability Phonetic Training (HVPT) is effective with computer-synthesized voices and recordings of native speakers collected from international websites. HVPT is the ‚Äúhot topic‚Äù in Applied Linguistics, with more than eighty papers published recently. HVPT is only available for English and required a decade of collecting recordings of thousands of speakers and generations of graduate students processing the recordings. The PI met with Ron Thompson, the developer of HVPT. Dr. Thompson believes this research could work, citing recent studies finding that the number of speakers needed is smaller than was previously believed. This could make HVPT available for many languages.

This project will research the development of pronunciation assessment feedback and its integration with speech perception training, i.e., one pedagogical instrument for listening and speaking. Some language apps use automatic speech recognition (ASR) to test learners‚Äô pronunciation. ASR guesses what the speaker intended to say, not what the speaker said. This often returns words that are wildly off with non-native speakers. Automated pronunciation feedback shows a graphical phonetic representation of what the speaker produced. The Defense Language Institute has the only pronunciation assessment feedback engine, NetProF, developed by MIT, and available only to Defense users. The PI‚Äôs presentation to DLI faculty was well-received and they requested that the PI integrate this project with NetProF and make it available to the public.

This project will research UI design standardization of spoken languages. The Roman orthography of European languages is a standardization system, which makes teaching written languages relatively easy. Spoken languages, in contrast, have unique features and many have non-Roman orthography, varieties of dialects, and lack online resources. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is the standardization system for spoken languages but the IPA is notoriously difficult to learn. Instead, this project will research UI design. The Color Vowel Chart is a UI developed by Karen Taylor to teach English vowels. The State Department recommends that ESL curricula teach the Color Vowel Chart. The PI met with Dr. Taylor to discuss this project. The Color Vowel Chart has never been extended to consonants, suprasegmentals, or to other languages. Developing a UI with the simplicity and clarity of the Color Vowel Chart for all phonemes in all languages is a high-risk research challenge.

This project will research the development of dictionaries containing every word in a language. The PI believes that storytelling and culture in videos and podcasts will hold learners‚Äô attention better than gamification in apps such as Duolingo. However, other apps can‚Äôt use native speakers because they teach limited vocabularies of a few thousand words. Dictionaries contain only lemmas (root words), of which there are typically tens of thousands. This project will combine custom algorithms developed in consultation with phonetics experts for each language, with accessing multiple online resources, including cloud AI services, to generate all words in a language, including inflections, names, and places, totaling hundreds of thousands of words.

***15. Briefly Describe the Market Opportunity: Up to 1750 characters describing the customer profile and pain point(s) that will be the near-term commercial focus related to this technical project.***

We‚Äôre getting traction with the most scientifically cognizant L2 educators, teaching the most challenging languages, to the most challenged learners. This points to a commercialization strategy of complementing rather than competing with university language courses and creating new market segments rather than compete with popular apps such as Duolingo.

\- The Defense Language Institute is the largest, most advanced foreign language university in the world. The PI‚Äôs presentation to faculty was well-received and the faculty requested Arabic, Russian, Chinese, and Korean.

\- The University of Colorado has a Modified Foreign Language program for students with disabilities, including auditory processing disorders, that make them unable to learn languages in a mainstream classroom. Two CU professors have helped in the development of LanguageTwo.

\- The PI presented this project at a Pronunciation for Second Language Learning and Teaching (PSLLT) conference. His presentation was well-received and two Applied Linguistics graduate students asked to join the team. Many PSLLT members teach English at Asian universities, where 11 million Koreans, 12 million Japanese, and 300 million Chinese are learning English.

Enabling instructors to create video and podcast curricula is a priority in our app development. This will make the learner experience more like TikTok than Duolingo.

Our long-term commercialization strategy is to help American companies reach markets outside of the English-speaking world, and to help foreign companies reach English-speaking markets. We can then earn income without ads, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.

¬†***16. Briefly Describe the Company and Team : Up to 1750 characters describing the background and current status of the submitting small business, including team members related to the technical and/or commercial efforts discussed in this Project Pitch.***

After struggling with stuttering and earning his MBA from the University of Chicago, the PI founded Casa Futura Technology to develop technology that alters auditory processing to treat speech disorders. Over thirty years the company has sold close to ten thousand devices to schools, speech clinics, and individuals who stutter or have Parkinson‚Äôs or other speech disorders.

More than twenty studies have found the devices to be effective. Two studies found persistent long-term carryover fluency. This is the basis of this project‚Äôs aim to improve the efficiency of learners‚Äô LH language network permanently.

The PI has presented at many national and state speech-language pathology conventions on the topic of evidence-based stuttering treatments.

In 2015 the PI updated his technical skills at the Galvanize JavaScript coding bootcamp. With a background in engineering, entrepreneurial business management, and speech and language pathology, the PI is uniquely qualified to apply his knowledge of auditory processing to the larger market of second language acquisition.

Additional team members include two Applied Linguists. One is a post doc who is also trained as a UI designer. The other is a graduate student teaching English in Japan.

A software development company has agreed to subcontract engineers with specialized skills such as UI design, database security and data privacy, and AI applications.

Before I start I'd like to say that I'm Dutch and my program is:  
\- No liver shrinking diet before surgery, just trying to lose some weight and practice new eating habits  
\- 5 days of full liquids after surgery   
So I'm sure people will say: You should be on purees!!! Well no.. This is not how my health care providers work. 

So I'm 2.5 weeks out and I'm actually doing great. Getting 7 to 10K steps a day and feeling good!   
I'm very excited to try food. Staying away from fizzy drinks, spicy food, too much fat and sugar.  
No dumpings yet. 

But I'm having so much trouble with drinking enough.   
I tolerate flat white coffee really well but that is about it. Water is making my stomach growl and it just feels like the water gets stuck up there, it feels uncomfortable and then it drops and the feeling is gone.   
Same with sugar free lemonade, thee or bouillon.   
Milky things makes me nauseous. But I can't live off of flat whites right? 

Also dinner is a pain.  
For breakfast I eat greek yoghurt which goes well  
For lunch I eat soup which goes well  
Dinner is just a pain. The advice from my doctors was: Proteins first.  
I'm vegetarian so I eat my veggie chicken pieces first and then I'm completely full and I can't get to my veggies and potatos or something. I really miss eating veggies/potatos/pasta anything.  
And my program tells me I can eat them, I'm just completely full after my proteins. 

I'm only 2.5 weeks out so maybe this will get better but I'm also kinda worried. ",1,1740941099.0,GastricBypass,0,1.0,False

My husband (we are legally married but haven‚Äôt had a wedding yet) and I have not had an easy time. He openly admits to not trusting me, he often calls me a liar, manipulative, and sneaky. I am not those things, I have never done anything against him. There were alot of misunderstandings in the beginning, but I adjusted to make him happy. Everything I do is for him. He didn‚Äôt trust me when we first got together (long distance), so I moved my entire life to live with him. I left my job, my friends, and an amazing life I built for myself, for him. I have changed jobs multiple times to make him more comfortable. I have lost friends he didn‚Äôt like, I have changed my wardrobe, I have changed my personality (I used to be a very talkative and bubbly person, even to strangers, I quit this because it made him uncomfortable). I don‚Äôt go out, I barely leave the house. 

He accused me of lying to him about being with a group of guys this past weekend (he‚Äôs out of town, my friends were in town for my bachelorette celebration). He comes in hot with a screenshot of his notes app, calling me a manipulative and slimy person. At this point (Sunday morning), I knew he was upset about something, but I was not expecting that intense of an accusation, with all the name calling and anger. The night before I was downtown bar hopping, but not with guys. Just my friends. He said he had proof, and made up an entire story to go along with it. The proof was not proof of anything. It was video footage of me talking to a random girl, who walked up to me and my friends. We were at a street corner about to cross, just waiting for the light to change. She had 2 guys with her, I didn‚Äôt even notice them (if it wasn‚Äôt for the video, i genuinely would not have known of their existence). As he was accusing me of this over the phone, my friend (one I was with over the weekend), called me. I told my husband I was going to answer her. While I was on the phone with her (for 7 minutes total), he called me around 20 times. Non stop. While I was talking to my friend I told her what he was accusing me of, and his so called proof. She reassured me that I wasn‚Äôt crazy, and hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. She also assured me that no one in my group spoke to those guys, they were just kinda there following the girl they were with (the one I was talking to).

Flash forward a few hours, my husband realizes I didn‚Äôt do what he was accusing me of. He admits to creating a false narrative. But now, it‚Äôs a huge problem that I told my friend what was happening. I betrayed him by doing that, and she is no longer welcome at the wedding. He says verbatim, ‚ÄúI will be there, or she will be there, it‚Äôs up to you‚Äù. I am absolutely devastated by this. I can‚Äôt believe he would give me an ultimatum about my best friend (a bridesmaid) who did nothing wrong. She didn‚Äôt speak ill of him, she didn‚Äôt try to get me to leave him, she was just there for me. He keeps mentioning calling off the wedding, and calling my parents to let them know, since I already let another person into our relationship. I beg him to not put me in that position. I explain how devastating it would be, I tell him I don‚Äôt want to marry someone who gives me ultimatums. He keeps insisting I choose. I refuse, and keep telling him I don‚Äôt want to be married to someone who gives me ultimatums. He lashes out even harder, screaming and calling me names. All over the phone. I hang up. He texts me several times insisting I choose, I keep saying the same thing, and explaining how horrible it is to even ask. I didn‚Äôt only tell that friend, I actually made a group chat of everyone with me that night. I regret this now; and I even told them I was sorry for involving them. I was in a state of pure panic, and needed support. I can understand why bringing in all my friends would upset him and make matters worse. But he really zeros in on my best friend, which again, is absolutely devastating to me. 
 
He eventually relents, and says he didn‚Äôt actually mean it, and is okay with her being there, but still hates her. Things calm down for a second, but I am even more upset at this point. Was this all a power play, was he trying to bring me to my knees? 

I express my anger, and he says I never would have picked him anyways. I said I would pick him, but I would never forget or forgive him. I asked is that what you want? Me to give up my BEST FRIEND, to make you feel more valued? When I have given up so much for him, I have sacrificed so much. I won‚Äôt sacrifice my best friend. He starts yelling again. This just goes on and on. Now he‚Äôs saying the answer should have been immediate, I should have immediately dropped my best friend, no thought. An action that would devastate our friendship, and me with it. 

We went back and forth about that for awhile, but I eventually hung up. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. No matter what I said, it wasn‚Äôt enough. I wasn‚Äôt quick enough, I haven‚Äôt sacrificed enough for him, he would never be my priority. 

That same night he once again took it all back, and said he just needed to have sex (he has been gone for 2 weeks, and returns home in a few days). I was unsettled by this, but also considered it. Maybe it is the anxiety of being separate, maybe we need intimacy and togetherness. I wait for him to come home, hoping being together will fix everything. 

Over the next few days I am not myself, I express to him several times that I am not well. I don‚Äôt feel safe, I don‚Äôt feel alive. 

It is now a week later, Sunday. I have still not been able to get over this. He got home late Thursday night. We didn‚Äôt talk about it much, we were intimate and went to bed. Friday morning was good, we talked about other things, we were intimate again, but I still had that aching feeling. I called out of work to spend the day with him, hoping to heal. 

This is a side story that I‚Äôm not sure is relevant or not; but my husband thinks it is. Friday afternoon around 4ishpm, my husband says he is going to get on the Xbox and play for several hours with a friend. He said this in a joking manner so I 1000% thought he was joking. He wasn‚Äôt, he ended up playing from around 5pm to 1am. I was pretty pissed about this, but it wasn‚Äôt a real fight. I just expected him to want to spend the night with me, healing and being together, and he didn‚Äôt. To be fair; he didn‚Äôt know how heavily I was relying on that time together. He was fine, he had dealt with everything that happened and seemingly moved on. 

Move on to Saturday morning, I am having a particularly rough time. I express this several times, I tell him how unsettled I feel. When I‚Äôm not feeling unsettled, I feel dead. Drained. 

It‚Äôs important to mention that I grew up in a very volatile household. My dad was physically abusive on occasion (he had SEVERE ptsd, and never meant it, I know that). My mom was emotionally disconnected. He treated her just as badly as he treated us, and we as a family had a very very hard few years. I couldn‚Äôt be alone with my dad, I could barely hold a conversation with him. Things got better, I went to years of therapy and was able to be okay. I love my dad, I love my mom. I have not forgotten though. I feel the repercussions, I feel the fear. I have insane anxiety and fear when people are mad at me. 

I express to my husband several times how I‚Äôm feeling. I express that I am very aware that my trauma is affecting this, I explain that I am having a very hard time looking at him the same. He‚Äôs yelled at me before, he‚Äôs accused me of everything under the sun. He‚Äôs lashed out over and over again, but not like this. This was different and it genuinely shook me to my core. 

I am obviously unwell, but we continue the day. We go to the gym, we come home, I make dinner while he plays the Xbox. We watch tv while we eat, and when we‚Äôre done eating he jumps right back on the Xbox, and once again plays until 1am. This time around he is very aware how much that bothers me. But at this point I would rather him play, and not be mad at me; than him be spending time with me and resenting me. I knew he would rather be playing with his friend. I tell him this, and he accepts it. As I said; he plays until 1am. While he is playing I‚Äôm upstairs trying to understand my feelings and work through this. I kinda give up on that, and try to distract myself. It doesn‚Äôt really work. He eventually comes to bed. I am still awake, and stewing in my pain. He asks me what‚Äôs wrong, and I tell him, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm scared of you‚Äù. We don‚Äôt talk any further, he asks me to lay with him, and we both go to sleep.

We sleep in late, it‚Äôs 11am by the time we physically get up. I hop in the shower , he goes downstairs and drinks coffee and such. This was an everything shower so I was in there a solid 30 minutes. I get out and walk into the room, he‚Äôs laying on the bed. He jokingly gives me shit about how long the shower was, and how he came upstairs wanting to shower, not expecting my shower to take so long. I laugh and apologize, explain it was an everything shower. Everything is fine at this point. I don‚Äôt remember who brings it up, or how it‚Äôs brought up but eventually he says something along the lines of ‚Äúso you‚Äôre scared of me? You realize I had to sleep on with that on my mind‚Äù. I sit down on the bed, and start to explain what I mean. I express how much the yelling scared me, and how in my experience, someone who yells like that also hits. His demeanor immediately changes and I can tell he took that very personally. I go on to explain that I can‚Äôt justify his actions, while in the past I am able to understand where he‚Äôs coming from. But not this time. I say ‚Äúyou were completely delusional; and lashed out at me in a way I had never seen before‚Äù. This really really upset him, and we go on a tangent about the validity of the initial fight. I maintain, I have no idea who those guys were. I was not hanging out with them. He says ‚Äúyes you were‚Äù, and I kept saying, no I wasn‚Äôt. They were physically near me; I did not speak a single word to them, neither did my friends. This goes on and on. He eventually explains that a big part of his anger was my adamant denial. That I refused to accept that I was ‚Äúhanging out with guys‚Äù. Even when he told me he had proof, I kept ‚Äúlying‚Äù. I pointed out (the same as I did the first time), that his ‚Äúproof‚Äù was bullshit. It was a group of people crossing the road at the same time (it was a green light, so we all crossed) going to the same bar (pure coincidence)I talked to the girl in the group who approached me. I didn‚Äôt even notice the guys. We didn‚Äôt interact at all. While crossing the road, while in line at the bar, at no point did I speak to them. In his proof; you can see this. They are behind me; I don‚Äôt even look in their direction. 
 
He is getting more and more angry, I see his face changing and his calmness disappearing. I tell him that I am not thing to make him feel like a monster, I am coming to him with honesty and vulnerability. He explains that I am making him feel like a monster, and that I should know that he would never ever lay hands on me. 

I don‚Äôt say it; but I immediately start thinking about my dad. I‚Äôve only ever seen such intense delusion and rage in him. He would completely make things up as well, and go on violent rampages. 

He is still justifying his reaction at this point; and he says he is not trying to justify it, but trying to make me understand why he had such a huge crash out. I say ‚Äúis that not justifying it? What I want from you is an apology with no justification, I want you to tell me I‚Äôm wrong, you would never hurt me, and that you‚Äôre sorry that I‚Äôm hurting, I want you to make me feel safe‚Äù. He says he‚Äôs been trying to do that all weekend. He has apologized, but they always have a justification with them. He cuddled me last night after I told him I was scared; and it was nice to just be held. I appreciated him not getting mad at me for saying that, but here was the anger and the reaction. So there goes that comfort. 

At this point (I‚Äôm still just sitting on the bed), I chuckle. Yesterday I saw a post that said narcissists say ‚Äúyea I hurt you but now you‚Äôre mad at me, so who‚Äôs the real victim‚Äù. He asks what‚Äôs funny, I tell him. This obviously does not go over well. I don‚Äôt even remember what he says, but I stand up. 

I had a realization, I don‚Äôt care about the justification. I really don‚Äôt, because there isn‚Äôt one. I tell him that he just can‚Äôt accept responsibility for his actions, he rebutted that I just want him to beg for forgiveness. I tell him; I just want to feel safe. And I don‚Äôt. Especially not now. I walk away. 

I‚Äôve been sitting on our porch since then. He left the house, I don‚Äôt know where. I don‚Äôt care, I want to be away from him. I‚Äôve been looking at couples therapy options but since it‚Äôs Sunday I can‚Äôt reach out yet. 

So here I am, in a state of panic and fear. We are legally married already. Our actual wedding ceremony is in a few weeks. How do we get through this?",18,1740941062.0,relationship_advice,47,0.88,False

I respected this and our friendship went back to normal we get along really well and she has told mutual friends of ours that if we didn't work together she would be with me.

Anyway, I find out one day that he'd be moving abroad for university. I was pretty sad when I heard about it, but I was supportive nonetheless. But tonight I can't help but think if he would actually miss me the way I'd miss him if we were to go our separate ways in college.

Like what if we never talk again? What if he finds someone better abroad, then forgets all about me? What happens if we somehow make an LDR work, BUT we slowly lose contact over time?

Like I KNOWWWW he's not gonna be in my life forever, BUT PLSSS I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

Just visited DLP in Feb 2025 for my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday, and IMHO it was the perfect age for our first Disney trip. Kids under 3 are free, so my reasoning was it‚Äôs a (slightly) cheaper time to try out Disney before committing to a bigger Florida holiday in the future. Even though she didn‚Äôt know many characters, she very quickly got into the magic and seeing everything through her eyes was such a joy.  

We spent 3 nights (Wed-Sat) at Newport Bay. I saw a lot of reviews saying how tired the rooms were so I had low expectations, but I loved it! Our room was great, found the beds really comfy, happy that there was a kettle and coffee machine too. Only issue is there is currently loud construction going on in the east wing. We heard it as soon as we checked into our room so I went back down to reception and asked to be moved (due to my daughter needing to nap in the room during the day) and they moved us to a terrace room in the west wing immediately. Excellent service. So if you think it‚Äôll disturb your kids sleep, speak to them asap.

The main park (specifically Fantasyland) is without a doubt the best for toddlers. My daughter‚Äôs favourite rides were Casey Jr, the teacups, the carousel and Dumbo. We went on the teacups & carousel multiple times a day, basically any time we were nearby and the queue was less than 10mins. My surprise favourite ride was Buzz Laser Blast, and of course Pirates. Over at Studios her favourite ride was Slinky - don‚Äôt miss it with younger kids. 

She also LOVED the parade so we watched it every day from a different location. The best was near the start outside Bella Notte - arrived about 5pm (30mins before start) to get a good spot. Being at the front with a young kid meant we got lots of interaction from the characters - she even got a kiss on the cheek from Pluto! Worst view was near the castle / top of Main Street, I wouldn‚Äôt stand there again. Too busy. 

We took her back to the hotel to nap each day and while one parent stayed with her, the other went to visit Studios park alone and hit as many rides as possible using single rider queues. This worked so well! We managed Avengers Flight Force, Spider-Man WEB and Ratatouille all within an hour (1pm-2pm), all single rider. We also did the same for the fireworks show at night - took turns in sneaking back out to the park after putting her to bed. Just be aware that the queue at the ticket gate is pretty long just before 9pm!

On, off, dim.","Hey everyone, my needs are extremely basic, and I am illiterate with theater tech. What I'm looking for is a low-cost, dead simple stage lighting ""rig"" that's portable (ideally for a tripod?) It feels like everything I can find is overcomplicated, over-featured, and requires additional hardware or software to control. I want to emphasize how basic my needs are: I have a group of amateur improv theater friends who are doing extremely small shows at a local bookstore and a local coffee shop, after hours. Literally ALL I want is a stage light with an on/off button and a dimmer switch that I can operate from like 15 feet away. At MOST, I guess I could use an RGB bar. I don't want or need a fancy controller, and I would rather play in traffic than download and learn new software on my shitty laptop. My needs won't grow, because other venues have their own lighting rigs. If I could have a remote (or wired, idgaf) control that had nothing but a dim slider and 4 buttons for red, green, blue, and white, I would cry tears of joy. That's literally all I'm after. here is zero need for the lights to interplay with music. We're using an aux chord to a portable speaker for sound. 

Honestly, if could use 2 floor lamps with remote dimmers, I would. They'd just take up space and would get knocked over. Do all-in-one systems exist that are geared towards broke idiots?",0,1740940847.0,stagelighting,2,0.5,False

1j1xvyj,https://i.redd.it/nw8csdzhmbme1.jpeg,Do I need gum grafts?,"Long story below (with oral hygiene redemption!)‚Ä¶. But do you think I need gum grafts? My dentist has not mentioned it but my receded gums bother me aesthetically. I will be starting Invisalign soon and the orthodontists from the few consultations I did seemed unconcerned. 

It‚Äôs been a rough 10 years for my teeth and my mental health. 

I was in college from 2015-2019 and did not take good care of my teeth. I never missed a 6 month dental cleaning, but I also was not flossing, was brushing once a day with a manual toothbrush for less than a minute, and drinking SO MUCH soda, coffee, and sugary alcoholic drinks. Based on pictures of myself, I think my gums started receding from poor oral hygiene around 2018. 

I graduated in spring 2019 and immediately started an office job. It was a rough transition to always being around my friends and people my age in college to living alone in a new city. Then Covid hit. I started working from home, still living alone. There were points I didn‚Äôt talk to another human for weeks at a time. My mental health tanked. I was very depressed and don‚Äôt remember brushing my teeth much. Definitely wasn‚Äôt flossing. Still drinking sugary everything. I had so many cavities filled. 

In 2022 I was starting to feel mentally a bit better. I bought a sonicare toothbrush and was determined to be better about my teeth. I used the toothbrush head that came with the toothbrush (spoiler alert, it was a medium bristle one) and didn‚Äôt read the instructions so I didn‚Äôt know what the pressure sensor alerts meant. I brushed away my gums. At my next dental cleaning I was having cold sensitivity on some of my upper teeth on my right side. I didn‚Äôt know gums didn‚Äôt grow back. The hygienist was very kind and educated me about my toothbrush and said the best we can do is try to keep the recession where it is now. My mental health tumbled again and I stopped using the sonicare and went back to a soft manual toothbrush once a day. 

In fall 2023 I was told I had a couple of 4mm pockets by where my wisdom teeth used to be. I was told I really needed to floss, and they wanted to see me again in 4 months instead of 6 for another cleaning. I didn‚Äôt know how to floss and at the age of 27 I was too embarrassed to ask them to show me how. I bought a water pik since it was better than nothing. I got my pockets down to 3mm and am back to 6 month cleanings (yay me!). 

But I also had started adding zero sugar propel packets to the water I was sipping on all day. I thought I was doing such a good thing drinking water with zero sugar flavor in it. I was taking spironolactone for acne and it really dehydrated me so I was trying to add electrolytes. I didn‚Äôt read the ingredients of the propel packets. The first ingredient is citric acid. I was sipping on propel for a year all day everyday. I got 2 more cavities and had them filled a little over a month ago. 

I‚Äôm determined to be better this year. I learned how to floss with string floss! At bedtime I still use my water pik first, then use string floss. I got extra soft bristle heads for my sonicare, and I GENTLY brush twice a day and use prescription fluoride toothpaste at night after flossing (I use crest gum detoxify in the morning). I drink PLAIN WATER throughout the day and I have 1 soda a week (I drink it with my meal and try to swish with water after). I‚Äôm working on my sugar addiction. 

After my fillings my dentist told me my misaligned bite is causing my front teeth to wear down. I am getting consultations for Invisalign or braces to fix my bite and maybe even make my teeth easier to keep clean. 

In summary I want to improve my oral health. I have a dentist I trust and a fantastic therapist. I think I found an orthodontist I trust and am excited to fix my bite and straighten my teeth. And most importantly, I want to be alive. ",1,1740940690.0,askdentists,3,1.0,False

Steamed Milk ‚Äì Just keep practicing. Once you get the hang of it, it‚Äôs really simple because the process stays the same.

Latte Art‚Äì Perfection isn‚Äôt necessary. The reflection line (the bottom brown square) is super helpful since it mirrors one side, and you only need to focus on one half. Plus, once you pass the trial, you don‚Äôt have to worry about doing more art!

Drinks ‚Äì You don‚Äôt need to follow a strict order. I find it‚Äôs easiest to add the small ingredients like ice, syrup, and shots first, then just top it off with milk or water.

Water ‚Äì This one seems a bit fussy. Use a glass unless it specifies ‚Äúcup‚Äù ‚Äî in that case, you need a coffee cup. Add 2 ice cubes and fill it to the top.

Profit‚Äì Upgrades for longer hours and more patience significantly boosted the profit I was making.

Refunds ‚Äì The most common reason for refunds is when I over-brew the coffee. If I‚Äôve given the wrong syrups or imperfect milk, they‚Äôve generally accepted it as long as the coffee‚Äôs good.

Scared of getting a disease (rant),"Sorry to make yet another one of these posts lol, I just needed to vent a little. I just bought an iced coffee at a cafe I‚Äôve been to quite a few times. Lately I‚Äôve been feeling extra paranoid about outside food/drinks, getting scared of contamination (anywhere from food poisoning to viruses/hiv). But today I bought an iced coffee, and saw the barista joking with their coworker while making my drink. I could hear, but it sounded like they said they were going to mess with my drink, and the co-worker went ‚Äúnoooo‚Äù in a jokey way, and the barista reaffirmed they would. 

I‚Äôm aware this sounds crazy. I thought about asking to remake it, but the chances of it being contaminated would be worse second go around (like maybe they would spit in it for real because they were angry?). 

I‚Äôm so stupid because I drank it anyways. It tasted fine, but I should have thrown it away. I just didn‚Äôt want to be wasteful. Now my mind and my body are screaming that I‚Äôve been infected, that my drink looked an ‚Äúoff‚Äù color and that my drink was infected with blood or spit because the barista was part at me or tired of their job and that now I have a disease. I know that‚Äôs so unfair, I would never want to think poorly of someone like that. But I‚Äôm literally spiralling, I feel like my life is over, all over a stupid drink that I had to buy, how I deserve this for wasting so much money on coffee. I regret drinking it so much. But I also know I‚Äôm being unreasonable, and it‚Äôs my OCD. I feel sick to my stomach. I can‚Äôt  keep living like this. I‚Äôm so tired of this disease. I wish I never drank coffee at all!

1j1xu4j,https://i.redd.it/5fayztf3mbme1.jpeg,Carnival Cruise Lines Service Gratuities Receipt,"Receipt breaking down Carnival‚Äôs AG / Service Gratuity charges. 

For those of you wondering why these are negative amounts on the receipt, it is because I removed the AG service charges and tipped in cash.

I knew the total AG charges were going to be $378 for a three people in a suite on a 7 day cruise. So I brought $380 in cash with me.

Tips were given directly and discreetly to the crew in Tip Slips (little gift card holders with thank you written in multiple languages on the outside) with cash stuffed inside. 

Cash tip breakdown‚Ä¶

$175 - Room Steward 
$175 - MDR Staff - we eat dinner every night 
$20 - MDR Staff - 3 Port Day Breakfasts
$10 - Customer Service Desk Worker
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Total: $380

Our party also had the drink package and a 18% gratuity was already included in every drink we got. 

We left an additional $1 or $2 dollars in cash each time we got a drink as well. We also tipped the same for any specialty desserts that we got from the coffee bar.

Before you judge, please note we‚Äôve been cruising for over 20 years and this is the first cruise that we decided to take the AG / Service Charges off and tip in cash.

Back in the day, there wasn‚Äôt any AG / Service Charges automatically charged. There would be envelopes left in your cabin that you could put cash tips in if you felt the service was above and beyond.

One more thing, have you always worried and wondered what it‚Äôs like asking the customer service worker to remove the AG / Service Charges?

Don‚Äôt worry! I thought they were going to ask if there were problems and why we wanted to remove them, etc. 

The customer service worker didn‚Äôt ask us anything. We voluntarily told him we are tipping in cash. He just removed the charges from our S&S account and had us sign a refund receipt. 

After our transaction I gave the customer service worker one of the tip slips with a cash tip stuffed inside. He was extremely grateful for our generosity and was kind of surprised that he was tipped.

worked the same shitty job as me,
hated the same customers,
laughed at the same jokes.

He told me about a girl he loved.
Said she smelled like oranges
and kissed like she had something to prove.
Said she left a note on his nightstand
that just said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to eat.‚Äù

That was two years ago.
She‚Äôs gone now.
And he hasn‚Äôt been the same since.

Now he drinks his coffee cold,
lets his laundry pile up,
forgets his own birthday.
Tells me the last good thing
that ever happened to him
was waking up to that note.

And I believe him.

Because some people live their whole lives
off of one moment of kindness,
one hand on their cheek,
one time somebody looked at them like
they mattered.

Some people don‚Äôt get a second good thing.
Some people are just waiting to forget the first.",3,1740940262.0,Poem,1,1.0,False

1j1xphk,https://www.reddit.com/r/jasonisbell/comments/1j1xphk/song_of_the_week_white_beretta/,Song of the Week: White Beretta,"https://youtu.be/4mauQ0lygg8?si=nF7RrmiZ6KGRckX3

https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonisbell/whiteberetta.html

Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we are going to be tackling ‚ÄúWhite Beretta‚Äù which is the eleventh track from the 2023 album Weathervanes. 

Now I promise next week we‚Äôll talk about a more ‚Äúupbeat‚Äù song as this one features some heavy topics just like last week‚Äôs song.  And that‚Äôs because this song covers the subject of abortion and all the complicated feelings that both people in a relationship feel. 

The song itself begins with a half second of a shaker before the rest of the band kicks in.   We are met with a melancholic acoustic guitar progression, a steady but slower drum beat, some twangy electric leads and some atmospheric sounds in the background. On a first listen I think I was a little underwhelmed with the music (mostly because the drums stay unchanged for much of the song‚Äôs runtime) but once I heard the lyrics I understood it more. The chords provide the perfect backdrop for the hurt in this song and those backing noises (I can‚Äôt decide if they are guitar leads or a keyboard) give the song that haunting feel. 

Jason gives us the imagery of him and his girlfriend at the time running red lights in a ‚Äúhurry to get to nowhere.‚Äù Although we do learn that they are on their way to Memphis, specifically to get an abortion. An 19 year old Jason (‚Äú19 years old in 1998‚Äù) comforts his girlfriend by telling her that she‚Äôll feel better in a couple of days. And even though the song begins with the lyrics about them running red lights in a white Beretta, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just literal. I feel like that line is used to describe how they were a bit reckless in their younger days. And now they are driving to Memphis to ‚Äúget it over with.‚Äù 

The pre chorus sees Sadler laying down some smooth backing harmonies that make you wish he did it more often. Him and Jason sing about he was raised religious and ‚Äúsaved‚Äù before he even left home. Not only is abortion considered ‚Äúevil‚Äù by some religions, but its brings up conflicting emotions for Jason. He questions why he has to feel miserable about their situation if god‚Äôs love is suppose to be unconditional. He ends this heartbreaking verse with the lyric ‚Äúwhy are you digging your nails in the styrofoam?‚Äù I can imagine his partner becoming anxious and grabbing onto a part of the car or even a cheap cup of coffee in the waiting room. 

The chorus hits us with some heart wrenching vocals from Jason as he thanks and apologizes to his former partner. He acknowledges that despite it being a long time ago and despite him being too young to know better, there‚Äôs no excuse. He thanks her being who she is and for being strong for the both of them while feeling sorry for everything she had to do through after getting the abortion. 

The second verse sees an older Jason as this time he‚Äôs actually stopping at the red light. He‚Äôs listening to the Son Volt song ‚ÄúWindfall‚Äù while he‚Äôs reflecting back on this situation. He understands that back then he wasn‚Äôt mature enough to be someone‚Äôs father, hell, back then he couldn‚Äôt even boil a pot of water. In the next pre chorus we got those same religious themes but with some alternate lyrics. This time Jason is thankful that his girlfriend wasn‚Äôt brought up in religion like him because she wouldn‚Äôt feel that same shame that he felt. And again he apologizes to her about having to go into the doctor‚Äôs room alone. 

After another chorus we get a brief guitar solo that fits the song perfectly. This leads us into one last chorus where Jason sings ‚ÄúI thank you for your grace, for the dreams we got to chase.‚Äù Jason is not only grateful for her and her decision but it also sounds like he‚Äôs getting closure after they eventually broke up. He‚Äôs choosing to look back at the good times during their relationship and I fell like that‚Äôs an important aspect to this song. The song then ends with the lyrics that started the song in a full circle way. 

I tend to compare this song to ‚ÄúBrick‚Äù by Ben Folds Five, another one of my favorite song writers. Or even ‚ÄúCarriage‚Äù by the Counting Crows. All three songs deal with the same subject matter, but I love Jason‚Äôs take here. He reflects on those times and takes accountability for himself. It‚Äôs a type of song like ‚ÄúYvette‚Äù that has a simple but perfect instrumental that is the right type of backdrop for a song with such heavy lyrics. And I personally loved hearing it during the Weathervanes tour. 

But what do you think about this song? Is it one of the better songs from Weathervanes? What do you think the song is about? Favorite lyrical or musical moments? And have you seen it live yet?",5,1740940248.0,jasonisbell,0,0.78,False

Hi everyone! I‚Äôve read lots of posts under ‚Äúplanning‚Äù and ‚Äútrip report‚Äù so it is time for mine! Please feel free to comment what I should have done better/ did well/ what I missed out on!

Diary Recap: 
We thought we were ahead of the curve üòÜAimed to be at the EPCOT parking lot by 8.20am, walk into the big ball, spent some time taking photos and you gotta walk past the big ball to where everyone is gathered. The crowd has already built up at 8.45am - we thought we were ‚Äúearly‚Äù Rushed to the Guardians ride, 45 mins wait time. Everyone has the same idea üòÜ 
 
Wanted to prioritize seeing the global worlds. I am starting to be hungry at this point and you gotta walk a lot under the sun to get to Les Halles, France for breakfast (it was a reddit favoriteüòÜ) Lined up for 25 mins ish. Didn‚Äôt know how I was gonna survive the day on my feet at this point. Food revived me.

Walked over to the Beauty and the Beast sing a long! Good to sit myself down and enjoy some AC. Got in the single rider line for Ratatouille! It was a great 3D immersive ride.

Speed ran the rest of the worlds, my thoughts are that (having travelled to many of these countries like Japan, China, Italy, France) I think theming is great but it‚Äôs not meant for people who have travelled? Morocco was beautiful! Surprised me you can find retail snacks, souvenirs. It definitely makes me realize that Disney is trying to get non-merch buyers to spend money there too.

Coffee was just sugary. Almond bread was pretty yum, wasn‚Äôt feeling the school bread like people said. Turkey leg was well down but huge and pretty predictable in taste, so I experienced some diminishing returns?  

Decided to leave around 1, easy to leave and drove to AK. First stop is Asia. Expedition Everest wait ~30 minsz Theming is amazing, the climbing equipment, names and pseudo relics are so fun to look at a friend with me is a mountaineer and says it‚Äôs pretty realistic. Ride was great. Headed over to Dinosaur Institute, wait ~20 mins for a ride was fun, and energetic! Caught the hourly Nemo musical, song and dance was great! Bought matching caps from a stand in Discovery Island - store assistant told us bugs life show is closing soon, so we squeezed it in before dinner res at Tiffin!

Service at Tiffin is amazing. The Maitre D told us this is her favorite restaurant across all the Disney parks in the world! Waitress was incredibly sassy and funny. We got their famous bread tasting platter - with pillowy soft curry bread, chewy brazilian cheese bread, and crispy naan. The portions are huge! Pork duo and fried fish was really yummy. Drinks were great.

Left AK around 6.30pm for MK - parking was confusing cus we still had to take a monorail/ferry boat over. Had a cool view of the hotel/resort tho! Got there around 7.30pm, and it‚Äôs packed! You gotta be determined in squeezing in the herd - and we got a good spot for fireworks at 8pm! 

We looked on the app for wait times for Tron and Space Mountain and it was 85-105 mins at this point, so we decided to take a lap around and see what‚Äôs fun to ride. Waited 10 mins for Its a Small World and 20 mins for Haunted Mansion. Got churros as a treat for us to enjoy while waiting 20 mins for Space Mountain. I‚Äôve had better churros but it‚Äôs such an iconic disney This was so fun! It‚Äôs around 10:30pm at this point and we saw TRON was 50 mins but still accepting people in line, so decided to test our luck! I got kinda excited by the niche seating position and it being an outdoor ride! Reddit said the ride was a little short, and I agree. 

Ended the last ride around 11.30pm, and slowly walked out. Took the ferry boat back since monorail looked packed! Tram available to your parking region. Feet were dead at this point! 

Additional review - I had time to visit Disney Springs the night before - it is a giant mall giving ~LA‚Äôs The Grove~ vibes. Polite Pig has a huge and delicious BBQ platter for only $66 including tip and the specialty rib add on! We saw people carrying around huge Gideons Bakery bags and ended up being influenced to line up approx 20 mins for 4 hefty cookies (pistachio, cookies and cream, banana chocolate chip, cherry chocolate ancho spice) and one peanut butter chai pumpkin cold brew 10/10. You can browse the giant disney merch store and lego store! Didn‚Äôt buy anything. ",9,1740940195.0,WaltDisneyWorld,1,0.91,False

She often offers to share snacks, asks me to join for coffee breaks, various company events and volunteering events. She also has given many mixed signals, all of which could be interpreted as just being friendly. I initially had no attraction to her at all but now have a huge crush on her after getting to know her better.

Recently we've gone to 3 happy hour events 1on1. The first time I asked her to join, she initially turned me down due to having a time conflict but quickly said she'll be available the following week. Second time I asked she agreed immediately. For the 3rd time, she initiated by asking me in a very flirty way. The following day we did not have the chance to speak, but she texted a random meme which I responded to, but she did not respond afterwards. There are other people in our team/company we work with that she could've invited to but only asked me. She has also asked me to join her at the gym a couple times but it never happened due to my availability.

Other than this, I mostly try to avoid her during working hours as I do not want others to think there's something going on. I get the feeling she tries to do the same.

The kicker is that we're both married. Please don't judge (you probably will). I'm only asking for your opinion of the above. Thank you!",1,1740939768.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

I am decently experienced in the hobby, make a fairly even split of milk based and espresso/americanos.

Usually just pulling 1-2 shots at a time, though will be pulling back to back shots during entertaining. 

What I have considered thus far:

Eureka Atom 65w
Eureka Oro single dose 
Allground Sense
??

I single dose rn, but don't do a lot of switching between coffees, just use the same one after I dial in, until I run through it. So a GBW is appealing, but I could be talked out of it.

Or maybe I don't need to upgrade and should just stick with what I got, I really hate the way sette's dial in though. Would there be a big upgrade in the cup moving to anything of the above (or other's I may not know about).

Few times a year I'd like to make either cocoa milk or golden milk. I'm planning to use oat milk instead of dairy milk, but I've seen that even the best brands have a lot of additives in them (not that they are unsafe or not good, it's just a fact). I've seen several product of processed oat powder that can be mixed with water and get freshly made oat beverage, I'd then mix in powdered cocoa or golder milk mix and mix / froth with a nanofoamer to get a good texture.

I am 3 years old!

Well, I am completely alone, and I hide this personality and thought and desire from everyone

I don‚Äôt have any friends I can talk to about this.

I always make mistakes when writing and rely on a ai, haha sorry!

Being little is fun!
But sometimes, I really want to talk a little.
I want someone to care about me a little to just hear me..i want to feel something..

But I‚Äôm afraid of people.

Anyway, I have a story I want to share.
I don‚Äôt know if anyone will care at all.

I‚Äôve learned about shifting realities!

And it's was so cool! If i could ever be the girl that live in my dreams i will be the happiest!

When I learned about it, I felt happy,
and I thought, 'I want to go to a world where I have a smaller, more beautiful body and truly be three years old!'

But I also want a father‚Äînot just any father, I want love!

So, I created a whole story! Uh a script!

It's actually the same thing i always have scenario about, i know it's might be a bad story in this life but it's just about me ,no one else only me , so i think it's okay?

I didn‚Äôt share it with anyone because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to be upset with me.
I just want someone to understand me.

 I want to talk to someone.

I want to share it with you!

Before I tell you the story I always dreamed about, I want you to understand me a little.
There are things in this story that you might not like, and I‚Äôm sorry.
I‚Äôve been through things in my life that i don't really want to talk about it but you might understand once you read the story..

I don‚Äôt exactly know the purpose of sharing my story,
but I want something‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt know how to put it into the right words!

Still, I hope I can do it.

I wouldn‚Äôt be the first, and certainly not the last. Not that that excused doing anything stupid, but it‚Äôs what I told myself. I opened my curtains just enough to peer out to my street corner, a solitary lamp flickering as if keeping time. 

Darkness had already settled over Westbridge, and my alarm clock buzzed quietly on my counter to tell me it was 9:15 on the dot. I turned my attention back to the window, seeing a car or two pass by. My house was the one at the exact loop of the cul-de-sac in the back of the neighborhood, not hard to find but often overlooked. No sign of Julie or her electric blue car just yet. I shut the curtains. I had several makeup products stashed in my desk drawer, but was unsure which one to use for the occasion. Was sneaking into school to do a senior prank 3 months late a lipstick occasion, or a lipgloss one? The truth was I didn‚Äôt actually need any, and I knew that. But there would be lights everywhere for Julie to see me in. Dashboard, car, fluorescent. It all had to look right. I had to look right. 

‚ÄúEleanor, are you all packed for Friday?‚Äù My mom called from downstairs. It was past curfew, and I hadn‚Äôt left the house. I probably should have been asleep, but she knew I wasn‚Äôt. 

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù I called down, ‚ÄúI have a week!‚Äù That was the thing. Why was everyone trying to rush this summer? This was possibly the only summer I‚Äôd ever have in my life where I was truly carefree, but that didn‚Äôt seem to matter to anyone else. My friends couldn‚Äôt talk about anything but college, while my mind was buzzing with all the glory of having one final summer in my hometown. After this? Internships, grad school, a good paying job in a city bigger than I had ever dreamed possible. But I wasn‚Äôt ready for all of that just yet. My phone buzzed on the counter. 

**Jules: Here, down Maple St** 

**Me: sorry, omw.**

 I hastily finished my eyeshadow, put on mascara, and threw on the only black clothing item I owned: a dress I had gotten for my grandmother‚Äôs funeral. My window has always had a ladder beneath it, some relic of a forgotten building project from the original owners back in the 40s. It was rickety, and I had barely ever tried it before, but it worked. Julie was different. If this ladder was hers, she‚Äôd have used it every friday night. That was something that I admired about her - her unwillingness to be whatever anyone else wanted her to be. She was an A student when the time called for it, dripping with sweetness when she wanted to be, a bitch when she needed to be, the perfect daughter when the time was right, and the most insufferable daughter to have existed when it suited her. I could never quite place my feelings about her. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with them, like a Christmas gift from a member of your extended family you‚Äôve never met. The humid air seemed to move around me when I landed on the ground with a barely audible smack, and the summer air was so thick I thought I might choke on it. Cicadas put on their nightly concert no one asked for around me, and dirt and rain and grass and the smell of someone barbecuing all mixed in the air. I ran to turn the corner, and eventually got to Maple Street, near the front of the neighborhood where my parents would never see Julie‚Äôs car. My heart picked up when I hopped in the car and buckled my seatbelt. 

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù Julie asked. 

‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù I nodded, trying not to wonder if she had noticed my makeup. She went over the plan on the way - there was a rooster on campus no one liked. Evidently, someone had gotten tired of their pet one day and let it wander on to our high school campus. Our real mascot was a bull, but everyone knew we were actually the roosters. That rooster would end up in the principal‚Äôs office for him to find in the morning (high schools apparently start earlier than most colleges). She had on rubber gloves, gripping the steering wheel. 

‚ÄúAre you scared?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat? No, shut up. Put on some gloves, though, we don‚Äôt want the feds finding us.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you going to leave a note saying who we were?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot sure. Maybe we‚Äôll just sign it ‚Äòyou favorite students‚Äô.‚Äù If her voice could drip with sweetness, it now dripped with an equal amount of sarcasm. It was true, Principal Morris was a dick. Somewhere in his 85 years on the planet, he had grown incredibly bitter. 

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt that give us away, genius?‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlausible deniability,‚Äù Julie shrugged. By the time we had gone over everything, we were in the back parking lot of the school, the science building looming before us. Shutting the car door, I silently wondered how long this school had been around. Shrubbery was all around us, and animals called out to each other through the starless night. While Julie went through the bushes beside the building calling out for the rooster like it was a cat, I pulled out my phone and googled how long the school had been around. 1938, apparently, was the answer, some funding from the New Deal, from what I could gather. The entire school looked like it hadn‚Äôt been renovated since then. I turned to face Julie, who nearly had the rooster in her hands. 

‚ÄúHoly fuck, Julie, stop, you‚Äôre gonna get salmonella!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWorth it.‚Äù She said, carefully putting it in a cage she brought.

 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to report you to PETA.‚Äù I feigned judginess. 

‚ÄúWorth it.‚Äù She retorted, ‚ÄúAnything for the best senior prank ever. Why didn‚Äôt we do one again?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo idea.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo creativity is more like it.‚Äù She rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúAll they needed was a visionary.‚Äù Then she laughed - at herself, at the situation, at everything. The principal‚Äôs office was actually rather small compared to every other office in the administrative building, and it was on the north side of it, directly facing the gym. And we happened to know he always liked to leave his window open just a crack. Using that as leverage, we made a larger gap big enough for us to fit through. Everything was neatly situated in his office - clean, complete. Not a single post it note or old textbook out of place. Shame that would be done for by the end of the night. It was quiet, though. A nice kind of quiet that settled on you like a well fitted coat. Julie broke it. 

‚ÄúShould we leave the lights on?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, let it be a surprise.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTrue. OK, we‚Äôre going to need to get out of here pretty quickly because I think I just pissed this thing off.‚Äù She counted down from five, with me holding the cage and her about to release the bird. This whole thing had gone off much easier than I had thought it would. I barely registered it when she got to one, and both of us crammed ourselves out the window into the muggy night again. In truth, we had barely seen the rooster itself. We were out as quickly as we were in. That was when we heard the music coming from the gym down the stone path. With nowhere else to go and no one to contain our curiosity, we decided to go down to the gym. The gym was an old, concrete rectangle that looked less friendly the more you stared at it. It was imposing, giant, and probably the thing people recognized most about our high school. As we got closer, we heard the sounds of camaraderie and chatter. Peeking through the glass doors of the newly renovated gym (there was finally a new floor on the basketball court - the last one had apparently been built in 1956 according to a sign about the construction outside), we were greeted with purple and blue streamers everywhere and a group of old people looking way more buzzed than anyone would have expected them to be. A banner behind them read ‚ÄúWelcome Back, Class of 1955!‚Äù. 

‚ÄúA 70 year reunion is crazy.‚Äù Julie said.

 ‚ÄúEspecially at 11pm.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go in.‚Äù   
‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôre here aren‚Äôt we? Why not?‚Äù 

Something was off about the whole thing, but I couldn‚Äôt place it. Yearbook photos were plastered along the wall and someone released a bunch of balloons from the ceiling. People were dancing, laughing. But something wasn‚Äôt right, and I felt it in my bones. I continued to scan the scene for any type of red flag, but Julie completely disregarded me. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm going in. See you soon.‚Äù She threw open the doors of the gym we had barely been inside in our four years at the school, and I was left by the door trying to decipher my feelings. Like so many school dances before. I ignored her, and I looked back around the gym from the window. Everything theoretically looked normal, but I couldn‚Äôt shake an ever-present feeling of terror. I decided to walk around the building, trying to get a better view from the window on the east side of it. Nothing different there. Still the same people, laughing and dancing. Some with walkers, but not many. Some hit by the Chordettes was playing as a couple people shuffled over to get the orange punch from the desert table set up in the middle of the room. My phone got spotty service near the gym, but it nonetheless returned my google search for my high school‚Äôs calendar. There was a class of ‚Äò75 reunion on the calendar for Friday night at 5, but before then - nothing. Just regular school hours. That was enough for me - I was dreaming, or we somehow had the wrong school, or somehow we had taken some hallucinogenic drug I didn‚Äôt know about. I walked in cautiously, staying near the wall and trying not to make a scene as the music became louder and the lights brighter. I heard bits and pieces of conversation as I passed by: 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Martha said. Now, I don‚Äôt know how much I believe her after the stunt she pulled sophomore year‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe look pretty good for a bunch of 90 year olds.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre you still on that? Ruth, that was literally 70 years ago! Let it go.‚Äù Ice shooting through my veins, I realized I had lost Julie. My eyes darted across the darkened room as a voice came over the gym‚Äôs PA system: ‚Äúalrighty, lovebirds, this one‚Äôs for you. You, and your earth angels.‚Äù The Penguins blared loudly through the speakers as I tried to see at least one of two things: Julie, and whoever had made that announcement, because no one was holding a microphone. I remained largely unnoticed as couples gathered up on the dance floor in their best 1950s attire. Finally, in the corner of my eye, I spotted Julie talking to someone near the pretzels on the center table. Moonlight bounced through the windows and into her eyes, shining bright as ever. Weirdly, the person she was talking to seemed to look closer to our age. I tried to catch her attention, but not before I felt an icy chill down on my shoulder. Someone had tapped me. I turned around to find a blonde teenager who looked to be about my own age standing in front of me, wearing an old cheerleading uniform. She had a gash along the length of her stomach, clearly visible through the uniform. 

‚ÄúAre you okay? Do you need help?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMe? No. I‚Äôm long past the time for help. I came to help you. You need to get out of here. I can‚Äôt explain it to you now, but you need to get out. Now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat? I can‚Äôt, my friend‚Äôs over there-‚Äù My tongue caught on the word friend, like my body rejected it. 

‚ÄúLook at her. Really look at her.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what was happening, but I certainly wasn‚Äôt in the position to ignore demands from someone who seemed like they knew much more about what was happening than me. So I did. In the time I had taken my eyes off her, Julie looked like she had aged a few years. And she was wearing different clothes. Older clothes. 

‚ÄúShe looks like‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, who the hell are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúEileen. Class of ‚Äò94. But that doesn‚Äôt matter right now. Get yourself out while you can.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat is happening?‚Äù 

‚ÄúGod, I have to spell it out every time. Every time. Look, just get out and look up the class of 1955. And then me, if you feel like it. But get out now.‚Äù I hesitated, looking back at Julie again. I couldn‚Äôt leave her. No, actually, that makes it sound like there was no choice that night, but there was. There was a choice, and I wouldn‚Äôt leave her. I ran into the middle of the floor and grabbed the almost unrecognizable now middle-aged woman away from the dance floor and out the door. Was it just my imagination or were all their eyes now on me? Shivers ran down my heart and through my veins, down to every crevice in my body. Eileen nodded at me as I pulled her out the door and towards the science building. 

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Julie protested as I half-walked, half-ran towards her car and shoved her in the passenger seat. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even sure.‚Äù I threw the car in reverse and peeled out of the parking lot before any other strange shit could happen. Whatever transformation I had seen in Julie seemed to be slowly reversing itself the further away we drove from the campus. I didn‚Äôt stop until I reached the Waffle House on the other side of town, the only place I knew would be open. I parked the car and took the deepest breath I‚Äôd ever taken in my life. Julie was still looking at me like I was crazy. I pulled out my phone. I took Eileen‚Äôs advice, but I tried her first. I googled Eileen Westbridge High School 94. I clicked on the first article I saw. 

*Westbridge mourns the loss of beloved town icon, Eileen Matherly March 18th, 1994* 

*Eileen Matherly, 17, was found dead on the campus of Westbridge High School yesterday, March 17th. The police have neglected to share much information about the case this soon, but have mentioned she was found in the women's locker room in the gymnasium of the school with a chainsaw wound in her stomach. Authorities suspect the time of death was around 12:15pm. Police are looking into suspects in the case, which could possibly include Matherly‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, Kyle.* 

*‚ÄúEileen was such a good kid,‚Äù Sarah Evans, her calculus teacher said, ‚Äúreally helpful around school, too. That‚Äôs why she wanted to become a cheerleader in the first place.‚Äù We will update as more information comes, but for now, we at TV20 would like to share our deepest condolences for everyone that knew Eileen.* 

My eyes widened, and I felt my muscles stiffen. My hands shaking, I googled Westbridge High School class of 1955. 

*Inside Westbridge, 1955: the unspoken tragedy that defined a generation (September 19th, 2012)*

 *Ask anyone from Westbridge who grew up anytime around 1955, and they will tell you that the events of January 9th, 1955 were nothing special. Very powerful people have worked very hard to cover up a horrific tragedy that happened right under their noses, but evidence exists that it happened, and the names of the class of 1955 cannot be ignored. There have been so many speculations about what really happened since then - but what actually happened that day, and why did it happen? Let‚Äôs look at the facts: At 1:00 on September 19th, 1955, all seniors in the school went to the gym for a mandatory pep rally. By 1:15, all any outsiders knew was that the building itself had collapsed, leaving no survivors and no members of the class of 1955 at Westbridge High School with seven teachers dead. The number often changes, going up every time someone does more research into the incident. Those are the objective facts. Some suspect foul play, some suspected a Russian bomb, or worse: a cold war experiment gone completely awry. Some have gone completely off the deep-end with supernatural theories. All we have to piece what really happened together are police reports and eye witness accounts. At 1:17, a call was made to the Westbridge police from a student out with a hall pass, Janet Olson. The report reads as follows:* 

***Hello? Hello, I‚Äôm at Westbridge High School and I‚Ä¶I think our gym just collapsed. The seniors were doing a pep rally in there, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶*** 

*What police would find later? Chilling. No bodies, no nothing. Not even a hint of a suggestion that the class of ‚Äò55, or the gym, ever existed except for what remained in the memories of the classes after them.*

 I stopped reading. I took Julie inside to get some coffee, but I made mine decaf. I still can‚Äôt stop shaking.",13,1740939172.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
