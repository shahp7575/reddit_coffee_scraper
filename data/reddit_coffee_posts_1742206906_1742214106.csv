1jdb7wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1jdb7wz/maurten_caffeine_too_much/,Maurten caffeine… too much?,"I drink plenty of coffee daily, including a big cup before runs, and am very accustomed to using a few caffeinated gels during a run. Yesterday during a half marathon where I would normally have 2 to 3 gels with 20 to 40 mg of caffeine each, I actually took a Maurten 100 mg caffeine (in addition to earlier Gu with 35mg I think). So I got more caffeine than usual. I am also accustomed to regular Maurten and the Gu… so the only “new” thing on race day was the amount of caffeine being somewhat higher (though still less than adding extra cup of coffee). 

About half an hour after the Maurten I started feeling bad, almost more of a worry of vomiting, but I know that could be the feeling when your heart is pounding too much. I was definitely not running harder or faster than usual. I don’t really know what was happening, so I’m asking is 100 mg caffeine (as a quick dose) too much?",1,1742213749.0,Marathon_Training,0,1.0,False
1jdb6p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/realityshifting/comments/1jdb6p7/how_does_the_astral_body_instantly_appear_in_the/,How does the astral body instantly appear in the remote reality upon thinking the thought.,"If our astral body exists within the human body, how, when we think of a situation where we are interacting with the contents of the thought, do we instantly appear in the remote reality interacting with the contents of the thought, that we see thru the mind?

Our astral body would have to instantly teleport to the scene and instantly be interacting with the conents of the thought upon thinking the thought.

Example when I think of observing myself from afar, pedalling a bicycle down the street on a sunny day when the birds are singing and all the houses on either side have long lush green grass waving in the wind, and there's a cat prancing on the sidewalk purring very louudly. A couple houses down there's a old man sitting on his porch in what looks like a wooden lazy boy chair with his feet up reading the newspaper wearing only a red striped robe, with his wife standing beside him drinking a steaming hot white mocha latte in a fancy coffee cup with roses on the side of it, brewed in a personal push button espresso machine.

I am looking at the whole scene observing every detail as I focus in on each of the situations, like the cat is black, she's a female with white paws and an almost glowing golden tail, an extra large cat, like the size of a small tiger. The bicycle I'm riding is silver with a titanium frame and super wide tires. Unlike an average rim it has only three wide almost fin like spokes, the gears all switch automatically and operate with some kind of magnetic forces which adds ease and smoothness to the pedalling.

The question I'm pondering is how, if it's true as many of the books say - that the astral body is in the human body, does the astral body instantly appear pedalling the titanium bike down the street if the astral body first has to exit the human body? 

It's almost like the astral body is materialized along with the scene that instantly appears in the remote reality upon thinking it.",1,1742213641.0,realityshifting,0,1.0,False

When creating my shot lists, I often find it hard not to think in terms of big-budget shots. I always like to include some kind of twist or ingenuity in them, and I try to piece things together in a way that’s a bit less conventional.

I’m not really into short concept films, I gravitate more toward dialogue-heavy movies. So far, my go-to inspirations for thinking about low-budget shots are Reservoir Dogs and Cigarettes & Coffee by PTA. I know, not a long list, haha. Also, both are very Hollywood-style directors.

I’m definitely open to suggestions from European or Japanese filmmakers as well, but it’s important to me that the films are dialogue-focused, low-budget, and show some creative or unconventional shot choices. That really helps me to better imagine and think in those kinds of shots.

1jdanw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1jdanw7/the_only_gap_is_psychological/,The only gap is psychological,"Yesterday was a very busy day with our discussion meeting and sending off our clients. Julie is sipping coffee in front of me and tells me she is writing about it now. So let me slip back to Longhouse School and NHR-1 (pp. 59-60). 

Shin’ichi is now concluding the Honolulu discussion meeting and giving final encouragement to the Hawaiian members before he and as party leave for the airport.

>“Though you may think Hawaii and Japan are separated by a great distance, they are really just a stone’s throw away from each other. They are right next door. These days, you can board a jet in Japan and arrive here just seven hours later.” 

>“So instead of feeling sad and lonely, please accumulate good fortune quickly so that your circumstances will allow you to visit Japan any time you want. I, too, will definitely come back. I will visit Hawaii again and again.”

What does “separated by a great distance” but “really just a stone’s throw away from each other” have to do with Longhouse? Well, in my mind, the planning and opening stages for Longhouse Elementary seem like an unending gap. According to the above passages, however, that’s a psychological error! I read from this quote that they are actually one and the same, here and now. The only gap is psychological.

Shin’ichi next explains:

>“But Hawaii’s past is by no means steeped in happiness. Those of Japanese ancestry, in particular, have had a sad and painful history. All of you, though, are here to change that destiny. As children of the Buddha, you each have a mission of boundless proportions. With that mission and pride in your hearts, please become excellent citizens who are trusted by all. To win the love and respect of others leads to the propagation of Buddhism; kosen-rufu exists in developing such trust.”

Again, I am taking this very personally. The co-founders of Longhouse—including me!—are all “children of the Buddha.” All of our lives have had extremely painful situations. But we “each have a mission of boundless proportions.”

Today my full day and evening will be re-visiting the homes of prospective families. What do I want them to see in me? The stings from my sordid past? Or my sense of mission and pride? My failures or my resolution to become an excellent citizen who is trusted by all? As the director of Longhouse I want to “win the love and respect of others” and earn their trust!

Sensei writes:

> Those who are aware of their mission are strong. Those who live for a mission are beautiful. The members felt as if a blindfold had been removed from their eyes. They even felt it strange that they had suffered so much from feelings of loneliness and isolation until then.

>The mountains and sea of Hawaii, which just moments ago had seemed to be tinged with gloom and despair, now appeared to glow with hope. The members’ situations and circumstances changed not in the least. But something intangible had most certainly changed. This invisible transformation in the innermost depths of their lives would ultimately effect a change in each of their circumstances.

It’s the change in my heart that counts. My task today will not be easy. Based on the applications prospective parents had submitted, today I will present to them their financial packages. Everyone will have to pay something, although on a sliding scale. Thanks to Eulogio and RV Park income, we have funding for scholarships. But we want every single family to feel great pride in being “co-owners” of Longhouse School and part of that involves sharing in the costs of running the school.

> Shin’ichi shook everyone’s hand and left the meeting place, praying in his heart that each of his treasured friends—all of whom were children of the Buddha—would lead a life of happiness. From the car window, he could see the ocean bathed in crimson hues by a blazing sunset—a scene too beautiful for words.

This time, my heart skipped a beat. The alert flashed red, insistent. I hesitated. Then, annoyed, I ignored Beedone and opened the door.

Everything seemed normal. Quiet street, gray sky. I took a step forward.

Then, at the corner, I saw **the man**.

1jdagqd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jdagqd,Traditional Chinese Cuisine: Dongpo Pork,"🇺🇸🇬🇧 Dongpo Pork is a famous dish improved by Su Dongpo, a Chinese literary giant in the Northern Song Dynasty. After fat and streaky cubed meat is slow-braised for 2 hours, the fat turns into gelatin. The yellow wine removes the unpleasant smell of meat and enhances the flavor. It melts in your mouth without being greasy, but with a tender and aromatic finish.

It's said that after Su Dongpo dredged the West Lake, local residents sent him meat as a token of gratitude. In return, he improved the recipe by slow braising the meat in a savory sauce and shared it with the local residents, creating the dish now known as "" Dongpo Pork ."" Today, this iconic dish remains a staple on menus at most high-end restaurants in China .

🇫🇷 Le porc Dongpo est un plat célèbre, revisité par Su Dongpo, un écrivain chinois de la dynastie des Song du Nord. Après avoir mijoté lentement pendant deux heures, la viande, coupée en dés et grasse, se transforme en gélatine. Le vin jaune élimine l'odeur désagréable de la viande et rehausse sa saveur. Il fond en bouche sans être gras, mais offre une finale tendre et aromatique.

On raconte qu'après que Su Dongpo eut dragué le lac de l'Ouest, les habitants lui envoyèrent de la viande en signe de gratitude. En retour, il améliora la recette en mijotant lentement la viande dans une sauce savoureuse et la partagea avec les habitants, créant ainsi le plat aujourd'hui connu sous le nom de « porc Dongpo ». Aujourd'hui, ce plat emblématique reste un incontournable des menus de la plupart des restaurants haut de gamme de Chine.

🇪🇸 El cerdo Dongpo es un famoso plato mejorado por Su Dongpo, un genio literario chino de la dinastía Song del Norte. Tras estofar lentamente la carne en cubos, grasa y veteada, durante dos horas, la grasa se convierte en gelatina. El vino amarillo elimina el olor desagradable de la carne y realza su sabor. Se deshace en la boca sin ser grasoso, pero con un final tierno y aromático.

Se dice que después de que Su Dongpo dragara el Lago del Oeste, los lugareños le enviaron carne como muestra de gratitud. A cambio, mejoró la receta estofando lentamente la carne en una salsa sabrosa y la compartió con los lugareños, creando el plato que ahora se conoce como ""cerdo Dongpo"". Hoy en día, este icónico plato sigue siendo un clásico en los menús de la mayoría de los restaurantes de alta gama de China.

🇮🇹 Il maiale Dongpo è un famoso piatto migliorato da Su Dongpo, un gigante della letteratura cinese della dinastia Song settentrionale. Dopo che la carne grassa e striata a cubetti è stata brasata lentamente per 2 ore, il grasso si trasforma in gelatina. Il vino giallo rimuove l'odore sgradevole della carne e ne esalta il sapore. Si scioglie in bocca senza essere unto, ma con un finale tenero e aromatico.

Si dice che dopo che Su Shi dragò il Lago dell'Ovest, i residenti locali gli inviarono della carne in segno di gratitudine. In cambio, migliorò la ricetta brasando lentamente la carne in una salsa saporita e la condivise con i residenti locali, creando il piatto ora noto come ""maiale Dongpo"". Oggi, questo piatto iconico rimane un punto fermo nei menu della maggior parte dei ristoranti di lusso in Cina.

Are you hearing this? Are you feeling the weight of what’s about to go down?
Because this? This isn’t just a rant.
This isn’t just another angry post.
This isn’t a moment.
This is a movement.
A line in the sand. A shockwave that will rattle the bones of every industry, every cushy executive office, every trust fund brunch table.
This is for the struggling.
The lost.
The broken.
The shattered.
The abused and the abusers.
The homeless.
The addicted.
The shamed, blamed, and written off.
This is for every single one of us that holds up their world while they pretend we don’t exist.
The ones with less than $1000 in their bank accounts on any regular day.
The ones paying overdraft fees just to afford groceries.
The ones who have to borrow just to breathe.
The ones who get laughed at for dreaming beyond survival.
And now, we stop.
Now, we step back and ask:
Who the fuck actually runs this world?
Who makes their coffee while they breeze past your post that you shared of theirs—without even a hi, bye, thanks, or kiss my ass?
Who does their dry cleaning?
Who delivers their custom makeup?
Who fixes their infinity pool when their drunk brother drives a side-by-side into it on a Wednesday afternoon?
Who stocks their groceries?
Who makes their food?
Who cleans their houses?
That’s right. WE DO.
The ones parking in the “poor people” parking lots.
The ones who like, subscribe, and share their content—content that bought their Porsche.
The ones who live paycheck to paycheck making sure their lives are effortless.
And for years, we’ve swallowed it.
We’ve showed up anyway.
We’ve been grateful for our shitty jobs, our scraps, our barely-making-it lives because it was better than nothing.
But now?
Now, they’re not just getting richer.
Now, they profit off of our pain.
Now, they turn our trauma into their brand.
Now, they market suffering like it’s a trend.
Now, they pretend to care while cashing in.
They post about mental health while exploiting those who have none left.
They sell books about struggle without ever knowing what hunger feels like.
They brand themselves as inspirational off the backs of people who don’t have the luxury of quitting.
And you know what?
We’re done.
APRIL 1st. GLOBAL STRIKE.
(Jokes on the suits.)
No coffee runs.
No house cleaning.
No stocking shelves.
No restaurant shifts.
No driving deliveries.
No child care.
No holding up a system that never held us back.
Make your own damn coffee.
Pick up your own kid’s birthday gift.
Fix your own damn infinity pool.
Wash your own fucking toe jam, you greedy bastards.
Because let me remind you of something.
THINGS HAPPEN IN NUMBERS.
And hate to break it to you, but in this sweet, unfortunate, and oh-so-bound-to-happen case?
The “crazy,” the “unstable,” the “unwealthy,” the ones deemed “unable”—
WE SUCCEED IN NUMBERS.
And here’s the part that should really make them sweat—
We outnumber them.
Addicts.
Criminals.
The mentally ill.
The ones they call “too far gone.”
The ones struggling under their weight.
The ones they threw away.
The ones who keep this entire world functioning.
What happens when we stop playing the game?
What happens when we wake up and refuse to clock in?
What happens when we decide to let it all crumble?
They think their gated communities will save them?
They think their millions will cook their meals, clean their sheets, and carry their world?
Let’s see how long they last without us.
Because this time?
We’re not asking.
We’re not begging.
We’re not waiting.
We are walking.
We are stopping.
We are shutting it the fuck down.
And we strike until we are damn well good and ready.
And guess what?
We might just never come back.
WHAT ABOUT HUMANITY?!
A direct message to the world.
To those who have power and do nothing.
To those who suffer in silence.
To those who think they are safe from this conversation.
This is your reckoning.
If you currently have enough money in your bank account to comfortably pay your bills and survive for the next two months—THIS. IS. FOR. YOU.
And if you don’t? If you’re one of the struggling, the blamed, the discarded?
This is for you, too.
Because we are done being ignored.
LOUDER. LOUDER. LOUDER.
TO THE COMFORTABLE: DO YOU EVEN REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE?
You’re not losing sleep over how to afford food.
You’re not panicking over rent.
You’re not one unexpected bill away from total collapse.
And yet—you sit there.
You scroll.
You watch people support you, share your work, uplift you—
And you don’t even have the decency to acknowledge them.
Tell me—HOW do you justify that?
How do you see suffering happen in real-time and do nothing?
How do you walk past someone sleeping on the ground and go buy a $9 latte?
How do you see people begging for food and waste money on useless shit?
How do you watch entire families drown in medical debt while you spend more on a handbag than they have in their entire savings?
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THIS?
WE COULD FIX EVERYTHING IN 30 DAYS. BUT WE DON’T.
Don’t tell me change is complicated.
Don’t tell me “there’s no solution.”
That’s a lie.
The world could be fixed in 30 days.
The only reason it isn’t is because those with power refuse to let it.
SO TO EVERYONE WITH A PLATFORM—A VOICE—A CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Are you ignoring this?
Are you reading this and feeling uncomfortable?
GOOD.
If you have the privilege of safety and stability, then you have the responsibility to use it for others.
And if you don’t? Then YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.
If you are struggling, YOU ARE THE REVOLUTION.
WE ARE THE REVOLUTION.
They want you to stay silent.
They want you to stay small.
MAKE THEM REGRET THAT.
LOUDER. LOUDER. LOUDER.
Because once this fire spreads, they won’t be able to put it out.

Every memory, every feeling, every emotion.","I've been living this way for 3 years now - the whole world and who I was before this is completely gone. I cannot feel, I cannot relate to anything, nothing matters. I have 0 sense of self and reality. I'm just a robot - that's cold, emotionless and selfless.

Never in my life did I think I could experience this. To live every single day with a blank mind, with no feelings or sensations in your body, no connection to ""you"" or the world around you. I can't describe the pain. Nothing has helped - meds, therapy, accepting, resting, mediation, giving it time. My whole life has been crippled by this. I was such a fun, outgoing, energetic and happy person. I loved live, even with my traumas. I enjoyed the small things - morning coffee, a walk in the sunshine, a beautiful dinner, travel, connections with others, hobbies. All of it felt real and like it meant something. I enjoyed it and being present, I felt it all. Now I feel nothing. I cannot enjoy food, a morning coffee, a sunshine walk. It's like my body is dead and so is my mind. Living in a severe freeze is probably the worst thing that can happen to a human being.

I have no hope of ever returning to the world and person I used to know. I lost my inner monologue. All the memories of my life. I live every day with severe fatigue, emotional numbness, loss of self, memory loss of my entire life - I can't feel sun on my skin, I can't feel the joy of trying something new, I can't connect or love anyone. I can't feel the seasons changing. I look forward to nothing - because why would I? Every single day is like I'm dead. I never existed. Nothing happening to me is real, meaningful or purposeful. I don't feel pleasure, pain, happiness. Sadness. Sexually. Romantically. Nothing. I'm a 32 year old guy with absolutely no life left in me. This should be the prime of my life. But since 29 years old, that person is gone. I am barely surviving. There's no purpose or joy to my life. Every day is just staying alive to pay bills. That's literally it. If you took that away, there'd be nothing. Life is hard already, but at least when you can feel things - it feels worth it. It's not worth anything living like this. I don't know how I'm even alive still. My life is completely devoid of any feeling, connection or pleasure. Why live like this",5,1742210431.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

My diet is of course not great and working on it. But I went and got a testosterone test last year and they measured me at 398.

Just feels like I should have more energy than I do in general and not sure what my options are without putting any health risk on myself with stuff like TRT or something.

I’ve learned to turn milestones into ordinary days, letting them slip by unnoticed. No plans, no calls, no warm laughter filling the silence. Just me, a glass of whiskey, and the city glowing beyond the window, alive, endless, and indifferent to the emptiness beside me.

I could genuinely admit to you, I spent years chasing success, thinking it would be enough. That the money, the power, the freedom would fill every gap and silence every doubt. That once I had everything I worked for, the loneliness would never catch up to me.

But success doesn’t make a room feel warmer. It doesn’t light up when you walk in. It doesn’t rest its head on your shoulder after a long day or steal sips from your drink just to tease you. It doesn’t reach for you in the dark, hands pulling you closer, fingers tracing your skin, leaving you breathless in a way that has nothing to do with exhaustion and everything to do with wanting more.

I miss that. I miss having someone like *her.*

The warmth of a presence beside me, the way she’d remember the smallest things, my favorite drink, a story I told weeks ago, the way I like my coffee in the morning. The way she’d look at me like I was more than just what I built. I miss the fire, the hunger, the slow, torturous way she’d lean in close, letting me feel her breath before finally closing the distance. The way we’d leave each other gasping for air, only to do it all over again.

But it’s not just the nights I miss. It’s the mornings and in between, too.

The lazy kind, where the world outside didn’t exist. Where I’d wake up to the weight of her against me, her fingers tracing lazy patterns on my chest, pulling me back under the covers because we had time. The way she’d laugh at my half-asleep protests, the way she felt like the only thing that mattered in those stolen moments.

But that’s all they are, fragments of a life that slipped through my fingers. A past I can’t return to. A dream I can only revisit in the quiet of an empty room. I wish I had a muse right now, someone to stir the silence, to bring color to the spaces success couldn’t fill. Someone whose laughter could soften the edges of loneliness, whose touch could make the world feel alive again.

Now, an empire stands behind me, and an empty room stretches before me. This is how I’ll spend my birthday alone, again.

So I raise my glass, to the victories I once thought would be enough. To the empire I built, the sacrifices I made, and the dreams that came true. To the love I once had, the nights I still dream about, and the hope, however distant it is, that next year, I won’t be sitting in the glow of birthday candles alone.

I take a slow sip, let the whiskey warm me, and gaze out at the city. Somewhere out there, love is being whispered between stolen kisses, but here I sit, with only the flickering candlelight and the weight of solitude.

For all I’ve built, throughout the years, for everything I’ve won, tonight, and maybe for the nights to come, all I have is silence, myself, and the lingering ache of everything I never made time for.",11,1742210108.0,offmychest,9,0.82,False

I'm talking about candy wrappers, grocery bags, bags of beads, textiles she can scrape her nails across etc. While I'm supportive of her hobby, the entire closet of our shared office is full of this stuff, and now she's filling up one of the empty cabinets in the kitchen.

When I look at this stuff, it looks to me like big piles of garbage. Literally mcdonalds hamburger wrappers and stuff like that just piled in there. There's a bag of coffee grounds, empty soda cans...I mean...is that not garbage??

When I try and convince her to get rid of some or all of it, she gets really defensive and accuses me of not supporting her. I am starting to get kinda worried about attracting roaches or other pests, and I'm also kinda concerned that this is how hoarding behavior starts because she will keep multiples of the same item.

Just me, a glass of whiskey, and the city glowing beyond the window, alive, endless, and indifferent to the emptiness beside me.

I could genuinely admit to you, I spent years chasing success, thinking it would be enough. That the money, the power, the freedom would fill every gap and silence every doubt. That once I had everything I worked for, the loneliness would never catch up to me.

But success doesn’t make a room feel warmer. It doesn’t light up when you walk in. It doesn’t rest its head on your shoulder after a long day or steal sips from your drink just to tease you. It doesn’t reach for you in the dark, hands pulling you closer, fingers tracing your skin, leaving you breathless in a way that has nothing to do with exhaustion and everything to do with *wanting more.*

I miss that. I miss having someone like *her.*

The warmth of a presence beside me, the way she’d remember the smallest things, my favorite drink, a story I told weeks ago, the way I like my coffee in the morning. The way she’d look at me like I was more than just what I built. I miss the fire, the hunger, the slow, torturous way she’d lean in close, letting me feel her breath before finally closing the distance. The way we’d leave each other gasping for air, only to do it all over again.

But it’s not just the nights I miss. It’s the mornings and in between, too.

The lazy kind, where the world outside didn’t exist. Where I’d wake up to the weight of her against me, her fingers tracing lazy patterns on my chest, pulling me back under the covers because we had time. The way she’d laugh at my half-asleep protests, the way she felt like the only thing that mattered in those stolen moments.

But that’s all they are, fragments of a life that slipped through my fingers. A past I can’t return to. A dream I can only revisit in the quiet of an empty room. I wish I had a muse right now, someone to stir the silence, to bring color to the spaces success couldn’t fill. Someone whose laughter could soften the edges of loneliness, whose touch could make the world feel alive again.

Now, an empire stands behind me, and an empty room stretches before me. This is how I’ll spend my birthday alone, again.

So I raise my glass, to the victories I once thought would be enough. To the empire I built, the sacrifices I made, and the dreams that came true. To the love I once had, the nights I still dream about, and the hope, however distant it is, that next year, I won’t be sitting in the glow of birthday candles alone.

I take a slow sip, let the whiskey warm me, and gaze out at the city. Somewhere out there, love is being whispered between stolen kisses, but here I sit, with only the flickering candlelight and the weight of solitude.

For all I’ve built, throughout the years, for everything I’ve won, tonight, and maybe for the nights to come, all I have is silence, myself, and the lingering ache of everything I never made time for.",4,1742210022.0,AlasFeels,3,0.83,False

Hi all, I'd really appreciate your input, as I feel I'm slowly going mad. 
It's been around two weeks since I got the worst flu of my life. Complete fatigue, horrible coughing fits, zero appetite, headaches, vomiting, even water made me extremely nauseous. In the beginning I couldn't lower my temperature below 39° and then it fell down to 34°, which honestly felt like my body was shutting down.
As I wasn't prescribed any blood work I did one of those at home CRP tests and it came out as over 100. 
I've been taking Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for a week, plus Rimantadine (they didn't know if the virus was a or b type), plus Cetirizine, plus  prenoxdiazine hydrochloride and ibuprofen.
Thankfully most symptoms have diminished already, but I have developed a complete disgust towards coffee and cigarettes (daily habits of 15 years). They both have the taste of a decomposing sweaty armpit, which needless to say makes me gag.
Beyond that I'm still extremely fatigued, sweat a lot for no reason and have random bursts of stabbing pain under my chest. Still no appetite.
Question is, should I go and check my asat/alat, as I'm worried my liver might have had a bit too much with all the medication or could the aversion to nicotine and caffeine be a side effect of the medication itself? Whats throwing me off is that it only applies to those 2 specific things and I have my taste and smell.

Nothing wild—just some drinks, music, and a few friends hanging out. The night was going great until my friend Kayla (23F) had a very unfortunate accident.

She had a little too much to drink, and at one point, she tripped over absolutely nothing and went face-first into my glass coffee table. It didn’t shatter, but she smacked her forehead so hard that she ended up with a huge bruise and a mild concussion. We took care of her, got her some ice, and she laughed it off once she sobered up.

But ever since then, she’s been obsessed with the idea that my coffee table is “cursed.”

She swears she didn’t just trip—she says she felt something push her. Like a force yanked her forward, guiding her straight into the glass. At first, I thought she was joking, but she was dead serious. She keeps saying the table has “bad energy” and that it’s trying to hurt people.

She even went as far as to “test” it by making our friend Ryan stand near it while she tried to feel if there was a weird vibe coming off of it. Ryan said it just felt like a normal table.

But now, Kayla refuses to come over unless I get rid of it. She says I’m “inviting bad luck” into my home by keeping it and that my apartment will never have peace as long as it’s here.

The thing is… I love this coffee table. It was expensive, it matches my décor perfectly, and—aside from Kayla’s self-inflicted head injury—it has never done anything remotely dangerous.

I told her I’m not throwing away my furniture over one drunken accident, and she got really offended. She said I was invalidating her experience and that I was “choosing a table over a friend.” I told her she was being ridiculous, and now she’s barely speaking to me.

A few mutual friends think I should just sell it to keep the peace, but I feel like this is a stupid hill to die on. It’s a piece of furniture, not a demon.

1jda2f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jda2f2/ongoing_journey_of_conquering_sleep_anxiety/,Ongoing journey of conquering sleep anxiety,"In late 2016 a stressful event at work triggered sleep anxiety for the first time in my life. The initial first few months was hell on Earth, as I was unaware of what was really happening, thinking it was something physical. Things gradually improved little by little as time went on. That said, on and off for the next few years, I still struggled. I went through all the routines. CBT-I, SRT, ACT, sleep hygeine routines, etc. You name it, I tried it in order to eliminate my sleep anxiety completely. 

I finally got to a pretty good place during the pandemic years, but in late 2024 I had a bad relapse. I decided to quit caffeine/coffee to see if that helped and I felt a lot better off of it. Less anxious, more focused at work, etc. It relaxed me very much which led to some beautiful nights of sleep for a few weeks. I even had vivid dreams for the first time in years. I thought caffeine was the main culprit for many of my continuing sleep woes and that I was experiecing a life changing scenario. (I had only started drinking coffee after my sleep troubles started years earlier, fyi). But it was not to be. A few weeks later after a few rough nights, some light sleep anxiety returned, leading to excessive early awakenings and poor quality sleep, putting me into a downward spiral pretty badly. The relaxation I felt after quitting caffeine slowly faded. The dreams disappeared. I was devastated.

Now, because of this extreme disappointment knowing that I reached such a great point in sleeping again (albeit briefly), I can't seem to snap out of it and get a hold of myself. I just want to go back to sleeping well again. The post caffeine quitting phase of great sleep I went through proved to me that I can sleep wonderfully again which is amazing, but its just sad knowing that it takes these big special occurences to completely relax me and rid of all anxiety. I really am not that anxious at all about sleep. Nothing like I used to be in my earlier years. But I'll admit, there's still something there. Since its been SO long now with on and off sleep troubles, I'm wondering if finally caving to occasionally taking some sleep meds and gaining some sleep confidence back could be helpful. I've tried melatonin in the past, but it proved to be overkill and gave me nightmarish dreams. TIA",1,1742209649.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Now yesterday was Sunday, so it was supposed to be a nice calm day at the desk for me, as most Sundays are. It’s about 15 minutes past check out time, I have 3 rooms left to check out, one of them was moving into another room so they weren’t my problem until their new room got cleaned.

I called one of the rooms, no answer, that’s fine and dandy, I let housekeeping know to knock before entering and hunt down the keys for me. I called the other room, no answer, again I tell housekeeping to knock before going in and be on the lookout for any keys.

The first room was vacant, the key left in the room. How good! Literally exactly what I wanted to hear! I told hsk to go ahead and clean the room and bring the key to me when they came for their break.

Yesterday, the housekeepers were split up and working from two trolleys instead of one, so I messaged the other hsk’s and asked them to knock on my other room for me. They do, and then I am met with the worst news I could ever hear.

The key was not in the room, and the guests things were still in there, with no guest to be found.

When I tell you my heart sunk….. We were sold out yesterday, I had someone checking into that room, I couldn’t move things around, I was stuck. I even had the guest who was going into that room call at about 9AM when we opened to tell me she was going to be there around 1-1:30, which silly me agreed too! (Of course at 9AM I was naive and believed I would be having a nice, chill day)

I quickly went to the reservation to find a contact number, and just my luck, they were part of on event crew that we had staying with us and had checked in after hours the week before. When a guest checks in after hours, they are meant to come down during their stay to give us their details (most guests do, but we host the staff of this event every year so we’re more lenient with them), these people clearly did not do that.

I was freaking out. I’ve had people try to get around check out time by evading my calls, I’ve had people tell me they were extending and then decided not to last minute so they could check out in the afternoon (their card got charged regardless, that counts as a last minute cancellation I’ll have you know). I have never had someone just straight up leave the premises on the day of their departure and just leave their things in a room.

It was by then about 11AM (because the other housekeepers who knocked on my runaway guests room will do anything other than what I ask) and I was desperately trying to sort out my situation.

I had flicked my GM a stressed out text about the issue and was patiently (sweating profusely) waiting on her reply. And then, and I am still thanking whoever is up there for this, our Front Office Manager (she lives onsite) came downstairs to go on an adventure or something. I quickly trapped her into helping me, which I feel bad for but I was almost going to cry at this point.

She found me the phone number of the organiser of the event and told me to try giving her a call. So give her a call I did. I dialled the number……

Voicemail.

Just my luck.

I left a desperate voicemail that I hope she didn’t check because I was actually almost hysterical by this point and waited to hear back.

The phone rang about 5 minutes later and I picked it up on the first ring, hoping it was the organiser. It was my GM, still helpful but not who I needed to call me back in that moment.

I explained the situation again, even though she read my text, and she asked if my FOM knew, which I said yes to because I of course forced her to help me. I told her how I called the organiser and I was waiting to hear back, though because time was ticking and I was on a time crunch, I was going to try call again. She wished me good luck and sent me on my way.

Now, by that point, I was getting to the frustrated side of stressed. I needed that room and I was going to do whatever it took to get it, and if this lady didn’t pick up, I was going to find someone we DID have a contact number for within the event staff and make them find these people for me.

Thankfully the second time I called, the lady picked up. I once again explained the situation, how we sold our last room overnight and we were sold out, that her crew had not checked out like they were meant to. I basically begged her to do something. She assured me she would get to the bottom of it and I thanked her profusely before hanging up.

Half an hour goes by, it was then about 11:45…. An hour and 15 minutes before my arrival was going to be there to check into that room. Two people came through the lobby and took the elevator to the second floor, the floor where my vacant yet not vacant room was. I held my breath, and stopped myself from reaching for the phone to call the room to see if it really was the strays.

I watched the elevator go between their floor and another a couple times, hoping that every time it went down that it was coming to reception. It stopped on the second floor one last time and I could not take my eyes off it.

I started praying to whoever was listening that the next time that elevator signalled it was going down from level 2 that it was my guests. I heard the ding of the elevator, I watched the little arrow above the 2 on the screen that shows the floor number point down, and I stared in hope as it came down to the lobby.

The doors opened, the same two people emerged and came to the desk.

“I think we’re checking out of (room number)?” the girl said, handing me her key.

I acted surprised, as if I wasn’t on the brink of going completely bald and quitting due to stress, “Oh! Right yes! Thank you, I’m so sorry about the confusion!”

She apologised because it was most definitely their fault and as soon as they left the building I got out of my chair, punched the air in glee and texted my manager saying, “(room number) is vacant! All is sorted 🥳”

Housekeeping got notified (begged) to clean the room ASAP, I went out back to let out all the breath I was holding in my lungs and to make a celebratory coffee, and my guest came to check in about 30 minutes later to a freshly cleaned room.

Please let this never happen to me again, I’m only 20 and my choice in career has already shaved at least 30 years off my life, I can’t afford to lose more.",10,1742209546.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,2,0.86,False

*  **Breville Barista Touch:** While technically a semi-automatic machine, the Breville Barista Touch offers a similar level of automation and control over the brewing process. It's a good option for those who want more hands-on control but still appreciate the convenience of an automatic machine.
*   **Saeco Xelsis:** Another high-end option from Philips' sister brand, Saeco. The Xelsis offers even more customization options and a more premium design.

when comparing these alternatives, consider your budget, your desired level of customization, and your preferred milk frothing system. Reading automatic espresso machine reviews for each model can provide valuable insights from other users.

Started on Friday night with my first 2.5mg shot. I felt no side effects on Saturday. I did have appetite suppression. On Sunday I woke up with a single vomit-flavored burp and thought uh oh. I proceeded to throw up violently for a few hours until everything I ate on Saturday was gone and I then threw up water and acid. By midday I had rested it off and remembered I had some Zofran so I took that and was fine the rest of the day. 
This morning I woke up at 430am with the vomit-flavored burp. I took the Zofran and went back to bed. I did not throw up when I woke at 6 and I was able to eat some breakfast and drink some coffee. I'm now feeling pretty full and nervous. I need to go to work and cannot get sick like yesterday. 

Anyone that has this kind of reaction, did it go away eventually or did it continue with every shot? And was it just the first day or two after the shot and then it resolves or does it continue all week?

I did stomach but I'll do thigh next shot.

I decide to have it for at least the first year but now I’m thinking I should extend it.
 I know if nothing happens, you won’t get the money  back, but I assure you, having that relief there is so, so nice.

When I first got my puppy, he ate my medicine that accidentally fell on the floor. I felt like such a bad pet parent but it happens so fast. He was so fast and it was gone!  It was $1200 to hospitalize him for 12 hours and give him some medicines. I paid $100 deductible and 10% of the total cost. To call the poison control cost $80 USD too. 

Now he is 6 months and appears to have what might be cherry eye. There’s a possibility he injured it but I can’t say for sure and now we have to go to the vet for a diagnoses. The insurance will cover surgery if needed. I tell you, I was laid off in January and can’t afford very many vet bills and his neuter is coming up. So I’m grateful I have the insurance and it’s affordable. I just stopped drinking my morning coffee at Tim Hortons to budget it in. ☺️ 

Just thought I would share my experience and I hope this helps someone decide if pet insurance is for you! ",3,1742208963.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

The waitress who looked like she’d dealt with this before, patiently explained to him that they take orders through a QR code on the table. That was it. That was the moment everything went off the rails.

His face turned red as he jabbed a finger at the little laminated sign. “So now I need a phone just to get a bloody sandwich? What happened to good old-fashioned service? I’ve been here for bloody years and have never had to do this” The waitress stayed polite and told him she could take his order manually if needed, but he wasn’t listening. “Nah, I see what’s happening. This is how they track you!” His voice was getting louder. “First, they get you scanning these things, next thing you know, the government’s got your bank details and your blood type!”

The whole cafe had gone quiet. Then, from the back, someone called out, “Mate, it’s just a menu.” That should have been the end of it. Should have. Instead, the old guy scoffed, ripped the QR code stand off the table, and stomped out, grumbling about “going somewhere that respects real customers.”

I live in London and I'm moving to an unfurnished 1 bed flat from the start of April. I already have a king size mattress, a velvet MADE Haru chair that can become a chaise or a single bed, a projector and a stereo setup.

There's a small (unpictured) kitchen that's in the same space as the living room, and a separate bathroom (also unpictured). I'm going to screen off the kitchen; while previous tenants put an L-shaped sofa where I have the screen, with their TV against the window, that doesn't appeal nor suit my projector.

I'm thinking of going a bit Eastern with the living room, e.g. I'm getting a height adjusting desk so I can sit on the floor (with a cushion) or stand (but keeping my work-issued desk chair just in case). A few floor cushions near the velvet chair should be sufficient if I have guests (we could also sit on the folded out single bed). The living room area is 4m x 3m.

If a couple visits (rare) I'd sleep on the single foldout bed and put them in my bed. There isn't really room for a dining table so I'm considering a lower (tatami tea style) coffee table and/or foldaway tray tables.

Not sure there are any other ways to make the bedroom work, it's a small space for a king bed and I need to put my clothes somewhere! There's a separate storage room for the ironing board, hoover, etc. (which can't accommodate clothes).

A) go straight to her room when you get home and see how she’s doing?

B) come home from work, get changed, go 💩, have a cup of coffee, watch the news, and then an hour later when your daughter comes out of her room, would you ask her how she’s feeling?  

Because my husband chose Option B, and I just can’t wrap my mind around it.

Sure, it’s just a bug that’s going around.  She’s fine.   But even when the kids are well, the first thing I do when I get home from work is check on them.  When they’re sick??  I’d fly through the door to check on them.

This is nothing new for my husband.  He puts himself before everyone.  

But how hard is it to poke your head through the teens door and check on her?

Maybe I’m just overreacting because I honestly think that I hate him?

Bogotá. Crawling under trucks, hiding in the bellies of ships.”

“Oh, come on.”

“Nay, I swear it. They settled in Bogotá. Then, after the war, their daughter... what was it...

Malarya...”

“Malaria.”

“Aye, malaria took her. She was still but a child. They had no other.”

Dua, rather than muttering some incantation against ill fate, rapped his knuckles twice against

the wooden café table, like a man knocking at the door of something unseen.

“The woman... she was broken. For a time, she did not speak to her husband.”

“And then...” Dua glanced up briefly, just in time to see Latife—balanced upon four delicate

paws—stretching toward his sandwich.

“Latife, here, my girl.” He tore off a piece of cheese and set it before the cat.

Ah, that’s better, Dua.

“Then, the woman said this to her husband: ‘I want a child. Let us adopt.’ The man agreed,

but the woman added, ‘The child shall not be from here. It must be German.’ The man,

seeing no other choice, resolved to go to Germany. And in those days—erm, the Forties,

yes—there were no planes. A ship... ein Monat!”

“A month.”

“To the municipality he went. ‘I wish to adopt,’ he said. But they turned him away. ‘You

cannot,’ they declared. ‘You are not German.’ The man was outraged. ‘How am I not

German?’ he protested. ‘You drove me from my land! I tore my papers to shreds! I am

German!’”

“Documents.”

Özlem, pausing with that particular accent of a Turk raised in Germany, took a moment to

savor the fruity aroma of her Kenyan-brewed coffee. The May sun filtered through the glass

façade of Brew Lab, spilling onto their table. At the same time, Latife, with a flick of her

paw, claimed another piece of cheese from Dua’s fingers.

“So, seeing no other way, he wandered from hospital to hospital. Hoping praying there might

be a mother who did not want her child.”

“Yes, I see how that could happen... I can comprehend it, but I cannot understand it. To not

want your own child...”



“Aye. A cruel truth.”

What is the fuss about? If the whelp is weak, why let it suffer longer? The two-legged ones—

what simple creatures.

“Did he find one?”

“He did. A midwife helped him. Led him to the woman. A beautiful baby boy, she said. One

of those Germans—rosy-cheeked, healthy.”

Now, this I do not understand. Why discard a strong whelp?

“The woman told him, ‘Take him now, or never come back.’ So the man took the child in his

arms and left. Then he crossed into England, in secret. A Jewish friend there helped forge

new documents, and at last, he returned to Bogotá.”

“Now, get to the story.”

“It isn’t finished. They raised the boy, told him he was adopted. But they prepared a box,

locked within it all the truths of his past. ‘When we are gone, you may look inside,’ they told

him. And so, when his parents died, he opened the box. For years, he searched for the mother

who had cast him away. At last, he found her. I tell you, when we lived in Bogotá, our

neighbor, Abraham, he brought his mother to live with him. She was ninety-three by then.”

“Well, well, well... That is a story.”

“Oh, Dua, you do not yet know the half of them.”

You have no stories. Now, Dua, pass me that slice of ham, and I shall take my leave.

Latife lunged toward Dua’s lap. At last, he surrendered the ham to her. Two swift bites, and it

was gone. She leapt from the table, slipping between the maze of café chairs with the liquid



grace of something born in the spaces between this world and the next. A handful of two-

legged creatures reached out to touch her enchanted, no doubt, by the way her long, grey-

white fur shimmered like moonlight on marble. But Latife had taken her fill of affection that



morning from Melek. At the café door, she stopped. She settled back onto her haunches and

fixed her golden eyes upon it, expectant. It would not take long mere seconds before a human

beast noticed. And so it was. The door swung open, and Latife, utterly unbothered, slipped

through without so much as a glance of thanks.

Humans were strange, simple animals. The knowledge of how to wield them, how to make

use of them, had been passed down for thousands of years since the First Great Cat tamed the

hands of men. Each newborn was given this wisdom after their First Trial.

She paused at the edge of the street, watching the metal beasts as they roared past. Useful in

the winter, perhaps, but dangerous. She would have to teach her whelps about them soon.

Then, swift as a shadow, she darted across the road and into Olea Pizza. At once, a battalion

of scents launched an ambush upon her sense’s flavours layered upon flavours, histories and

secrets curling through the air like whispered stories. A human might have smelled only



baked flour, melting cheeses, tomato sauces thick with garlic. But Latife? She smelled

everything.

Latife’s nose knew far more than any human’s ever could. It was not just the warm, twining

scents of baked dough, melting cheese, and thick tomato sauce that filled her senses—it was

the earth in the pots where basil grew by the door, the bead of sweat that slipped from the

nape of the fat man at table three, soaking into his collar, the flour in the proofing box behind

the counter, dusted with the ghostly scent of the sawdust from the storage room where it had

once rested. She smelled Melek’s daughter, Asya, from the morning hug before school. She

smelled old blood, seeping in unseen cracks in the floor from when this pizzeria had been

something else entirely—back in the days when men whispered and drank in the dark, and

not all who entered left with their pockets full. And she smelled the scent of her own legacy,

waiting below.The scent of her six whelps in their wooden box in the basement—where milk

had once been stored, long before her time. A ghost of that scent remained too, hovering like

an old promise. Human noses were pathetic things. They aged, dulled, forgot. But a cat’s?

No, a cat’s senses lived outside of time. And smell was not the only thing untethered to the

present.

“Oi, girl! You back?”

David was a good human animal, but Latife had no patience for chatter. The only

acknowledgment she gave the handsome man—who was nearing his fifties—was a brief,

obligatory rub against one leg. Then she was off, slipping through the pizzeria like a shadow

with purpose.

Olea Pizza was a long rectangle of a place. It ended where a small corridor branched off

toward the toilets, but more importantly, where a staircase led down. And that was where the

world changed. It was a thing about Beyoğlu—every building, every street, every doorway

held something else beneath. The two-legged creatures, for all their arrogance, never quite

grasped that. But the cats? The cats knew. Beyoğlu was not a city, nor even a district. It was a

place built upon places, a thing stacked upon itself like a dreamer’s city, buried and rebuilt,

forgotten and remembered in layers.The cats of Asmalımescit, in their riddle-dreams,



whispered of the foolish two-legged creatures who waltzed upon the bones of the plague-

dead without knowing. They spoke of how the humans danced upon graves, and they



laughed, for nothing was funnier than the ignorance of man. And yet, ignorance was a

necessity. Without it, the cats could not rule them.This was why Latife never wasted breath

warning the humans.

The stone stairs coiled downward, the walls narrowing, the ceiling arching overhead. Bricks

lined the passage, thick and old, red as dried blood. At the bottom, the staircase opened into a

chamber that had seen more than time itself cared to remember. Brick-lined, arched, built into

the belly of the city.For now, it was merely a storage room. But Latife knew the tension in the

air when Melek and David spoke of it. There were plans here. Disagreements. Perhaps it

would one day be something else again. Perhaps it had already been many things before.What

it would become did not concern her.For now, it was the heart of her world.

She strode forward, slipping past old wooden crates and forgotten shelves, and peered into

the box. All six were there. Yellow-White, Slurry, Tabby, Cursed Black, Floppy Tongue and

Long Face. Cursed Black was still sleeping. The others tumbled over one another, trying, it

seemed, to form a single, writhing mass of kitten. Latife stepped into the box, and the chaos



ceased. Five pairs of bright, hungry eyes snapped up at her, and the mewling began. The

scent of milk drew them as if fate itself had tethered them to it. But first, she nudged Kara. A

firm press of her nose to the small belly. A sluggish movement. A tiny paw, barely rising. But

the eyes did not open. Alive. But only just.

The scent—Latife had smelled it for two days now, and it was stronger. With a decisive

movement, she rolled the kitten over. Kara let out a tiny, pitiful cry of protest, a strange

sound. Not like the others. Not entirely of this world. There was something of a shadow upon

Kara, something of a place outside of time. Latife curled against the kittens, stretching just

enough that her belly was exposed. But first, she ensured that the weakest mouth found its

place. At last, the frailest of her children latched onto her, and for a moment, life stirred in its

small body.The others were already locked in their endless war, fighting one another for their

mother’s warmth. As they fed, Latife pondered. Why was Kara so weak?

She thought of their fathers. Four were from Squint Nuri and two were from Colonel. Squint

Nuri was a beast of legend. The undisputed lord of Yeni Çarşı. He dwelled in the abandoned

ruin beside Arkeopera, a relic of a time long past. Unlike many, he had no love for human

animals. He did not accept their food, their affection, their comforts. He lived as his ancestors

had by claw and by tooth, by the way of the hunt and he was strong.

The young males who sought to take his kingdom learned this swiftly. His great head, his

powerful jaws, the way he looked upon the world with sharp and fearless eyes—Well...Eyes

that did not look in the same direction, exactly. Latife had known his strength, and so she had

gone to him, seeking to make her whelps mighty. She had seen his glowing eyes in the dark,

twin orbs of fire that burned in the pitch, but the fire, she had noted, did not align. She had

very nearly laughed. Squint Nuri did not take well to jokes about his eyes. She had held her

tongue.

Afterwards, before walking into the cold night air of Yeni Çarşı, she had stretched long and

slow to keep Nuri’s seed inside of her,

It was there she had seen Colonel. He was young, muscular and sleek. His coat was pale gold

and white, his form filled with the unshaken confidence of something that had never known

hungered had taken him in. He had many strange principles. One of them was this—he never

took his feline companions to be cut. And so, at six months or a year, they left him. They did

not need him. They were strong. Fed. Beautiful. Ehen the city burned with the madness of

March, the young females sought them out. Latife had done as much. Şaşı Nuri’s wild

ferocity had given her four. Colonel’s restless energy had given her two; a bargain. A choice.

When the ache in her belly became too much, Latife pushed the kittens away... Enough.

They had eaten. She licked them, one by one, cleaning the scent of the night from their fur.

Then, she leapt from the box, slipping out of the chamber, up the stairs, past the humans, into

the street. The hunt called. She would feed again. She would grow strong again. Latife did

not eat the garbage that humans called food. Meat. Milk. Nothing else mattered. And meat—

real meat—was best when it ran. She stepped through the streets of Beyoğlu, where a stream

had once flowed before the stone swallowed it, walking toward the water.

Somewhere in the distance, the ferry to Kadıköy wailed. Overhead, gulls screamed. Latife

licked her lips. Tonight, she would find something that bled.



Behind Gülbaba’s shrine stretched a park, a place thick with trees, where shadows curled like

old stories waiting to be told. It was an oddity in Tophane, a remnant of something older,

quieter. The people who lived in the crumbling houses that lined the park’s edges were not

truly of Beyoğlu. They might have existed in some faraway village, some forgotten town

beyond the borders of Istanbul. Latife did not care for these pitiful human beasts. Her gaze

was fixed on something far more important. A pigeon. Perched on the branch of a mulberry

tree, its feathers grey and thick, its throat ringed with white so fine it looked like lace. Latife,

stretching into the silence, realized with deep satisfaction that the bird was sleeping. Tucked

tight, head buried in the down of its own chest, oblivious. She moved. A ghost through the

grass.Her head low, her shoulders tight.A single meter of space between her and her

prey.Nothing at all.She coiled her hind legs beneath her, all her weight balanced in that

single, breathless second.And then, like a storm cracking across the night, she leapt. Her

claws—hidden weapons, gleaming like flick-knives—shot from their sheaths, her open jaws

finding the fragile neck that would soon, soon be exposed.The pigeon saw her at the last

moment but it was too late. Together, they tumbled from the branch, a twisting tangle of fur

and feathers. Two meters. Three.Latife landed first.The pigeon beneath her.Its body writhed,

its wings a frantic blur. Blood was still, thick and hot. It was the ancient one.

Life itself, flowing into her mouth like the sweetest nectar, as though she were drinking from

the great wild soul of the forest. When at last she stepped onto Yeni Çarşı, her belly full, her

pride fuller still, she let a deep, satisfied hum roll from her throat. She considered, for a

moment, playfully purring at the black countess, the fool of a cat still begging before the

kebab shop. But then—The voices; six of them; a shattering of sound, sharp as claws, Five

strong cries and One weaker. It was not from the basement. No it was too clear, too close.

Her contentment vanished and its place to fear. Latife moved. She became anxious. An arrow

loosed from a bow, her limbs coiled with urgency. She tore through the street, slid beneath a

car at the mouth of Nur-u Ziya Sokak, and erupted onto the pavement outside Olea Pizza.

Fools.Fools, all of them.

Melek and David had taken the kittens outside. She saw them at once—hands clad in strange

rubber skins, metal combs in their fingers, picking at the fleas that clung to the whelps’ fur.

As if that [mattered.As](http://mattered.As) if it was of any importance at all. The kittens had not yet passed the

trial. The world was full of predators. Latife lunged forward, pressing her body against their

legs, swiping at their hands, willing them to understand. Put them back. Put them back. Put

them back.But the human beasts only laughed, joked. Other passersby—watching, smiling,

admiring.She was seconds from doing something she was not supposed to do. Seconds from

speaking in words they would understand. And then—A smell.Something awful.Latife turned

sharply, every muscle bristling. A woman.

A human beast, broad in the hips, lumbering forward, a leash dangling from one lazy grip.

And at the end of it—A dog. But not just any dog. A Yorkshire Terrier.Latife’s loathing of

dogs was only outmatched by her hatred of this kind of dog. Its fur was a travesty, long and

matted with the perfume of its owner, the oil of its own filth, the wretched stink of all the

nauseating kisses it had received that day alone. Its breath reeked of bacteria. And worse—It

had noticed her. The little monster’s eyes locked onto Latife.And with that stare, a new scent

joined the air. Fear. Sharp, acidic, like vinegar turning in the bottle. It tried to retreat,

scrambling behind its owner’s legs.



The human—ignorant, oblivious—did not notice.She was too busy navigating the metal

beasts that screamed past on the street. The dog moved closer and closer. It was a mistake. A

fatal one. Latife struck alack blur, struck of fury. She landed on the dog in a tangle of claws

and fangs, her voice a razor-edged wail. The beast yelped. The woman shrieked. The air split

apart. The human, now fully aware, yanked the leash—but Latife’s claws were buried deep in

the creature’s face. So when she pulled—she lifted them both. The woman flailed, and Latife

lashed out, catching flesh.The sickening tear of skin. A scream. Blood—human this time,

staining the street. And then Melek was blocking her with using her foot as a barrier, it was a

mistake, a second one. Latife struck before she could stop herself. Four lines of red bloomed

on Melek’s ankle. David, at last, understood. He swept the kittens into his arms, fled inside.

The world took a breath. The street stilled. The cars crept past, slowing just enough for their

passengers to watch. For a time, the city existed in the moment of the attack. And then, just as

quickly, it forgotten People laughed again. The cars moved on. The world spun forward, but

Latife, she remained for hours guarding the door. Chasing off the other strays, hissing at

passing dogs, large and small, it did not matter. She would allow no more mistakes.Not until

the moon had risen.Not until the air had shifted. Not until the danger had passed.Then, and

only then, did she slip back inside.

Down, down, into the basement. Back to her whelps. They had already forgotten. The five

strong ones—eager, hungry—latched onto her, seeking the new taste in her milk. But Kara—

Kara barely moved. Even when she nudged him toward her belly, even when she pressed him

to the thicker, darker milk that had bloomed in her body after the hunt. The test and the trial

And Kara had failed.

When at last the pizzeria shut its doors, when the ghosts of the city pulled back into their

corners, when night fell over Istanbul, Latife curled around her whelps and closed her eyes.

And then—she opened them. And stepped out of her own skin. Her body—still breathing—

remained curled in the box, her kittens nestled against her warmth. But her soul— her soul

rose. A thing of moonlight and mist, untethered.

She slipped through the walls out of the old pizzeria into Yeni Çarşı. The street was a river of

light.From Tophane, from Kılıç Ali Paşa, from Mimar Sinan Üniversitesi, the cats of Istanbul

poured forth. From Çukurcuma, Faik Paşa, Cihangir, they joined.The bookseller’s plum tree,

the great acacia by Dua’s corner, the very air itself glowed. House cats—locked behind

windows—watched with longing. They were dim things, their light faint, their souls chained.

And all else—the city, the people, the world— was nothing more than a shadow. Latife

moved forward. Toward the meeting place, toward the Great Assembly , to the Great Cat. By

the time Latife arrived, the square was full, as it always was. Every cat in Istanbul was

there.They filled the ground, the balconies, the rooftops, the terraces.They sat perfectly still,

their tails curled neatly around their paws, eyes fixed upon the great iron gates of Galatasaray

Lisesi.

They were waiting.They were always waiting.

The moon bathed them all in silver, turning each of them—no matter how different in color,

size, or shape—into creatures spun from light.

The humans, as always, did not see.



A few passed through the gathering—a shadow here, a whisper there—oblivious, untouched

by the weight of the moment. And then—The moon reached its highest point. And the

Ancient Panther appeared.Not walking.Not emerging.Becoming.

A thing of light and legend, unfolding upon the iron gates, woven from the same silver fire

that burned in the sky.

The murmur of a thousand voices ceased.

No more idle chatter. No more foolish stories of human antics.Only silence.Only listening.

And then—The voice. It did not come from lips, for the Great Cat had no need for lips.

It did not pass through air, for the Great Cat had no need for breath. It simply was.

Spoken directly into their bones, their blood, their marrow. “May the soul of the Forest

Mother and the power of the world never leave you, my beloved kin.”

The gathered cats answered as one.

May it be so!

The Ancient Panther flicked its tail, its body glowing with the light of the moon, its eyes

brighter than any star.

“Before we move to our usual business, I propose we begin with matters of special concern.

All in favor?”

“Mrrr.”

A single unified voice... a decision.

Latife felt a ripple of curiosity. It had been more than twenty years since the Great Cat had

strayed from the standard agenda. Not since the counting of the human animals. Not since

they had last tried to measure their numbers.

The Ancient Panther continued.

You all know our duty, my kin. We watch the human animals. We guard and observe them. In

the days when the Forest Mother first placed them upon this land, the humans were not fools.

They knew of the world’s soul. They could feel the shape of time. They did not need us to

remind them. But as the centuries passed, their blindness grew. And then, in the last hundred

years, they have reached a new illusion. They believe their ignorance has vanished. They

believe they have gained knowledge beyond any in history. They have convinced themselves

they understand the workings of the universe better than ever before.

The Panther’s eyes—bright as burning silver—swept over the gathered throng.

“We know the truth.”



A low murmur rippled through the crowd. Latife felt it a shudder. They had all known this

moment would come. But to hear it from the First Cat’s own tongue? That was something

else. The Ancient Panther raised one massive paw, and the murmur died.

We have done all we can to prevent this moment. We have fulfilled our duty. We have done

more than any should be asked to do.

The voice was not loud. Yet it shook the air.

“The bravest of our kin sacrificed their lineages, allowing themselves to be taken into human

homes, to be cut—”

A hiss, sharp and bitter, ran through the square.

So that they might stay close, whisper what little wisdom they could into human ears. The rest

of us gave up our right to the hunt, to the soil, choosing instead to live in the filth they call a

city. Why? Because we believed they might wake. Because we hoped they might one day open

their eyes. Because we accepted the burden of being their last, fraying thread to the soul of

the world.

A growl rumbled through the crowd with an agreement and anger.

But there is a sickness in them,” the Panther said, “a sickness unlike any the world has

known before. And so, despite all we have done, we have failed in our task.

For a moment, there was silence, a heavy thing... A thing that settled into every furred chest.

Latife could feel the regret. The Ancient Panther regretted the day it had first shown a human

the way to Istanbul. That much was clear.

The latest reports confirm what we all suspected,” the Panther continued. “They have not yet

reached the end of their destruction. The north—where the Forest Mother last draws

breath—has been swallowed by their mechanical beasts. They have buried the trees in stone.

They have torn the roots from the earth. They have smothered the last great home of the wild.

And so, from this moment, the world itself will take over. We all know the truth. The Forest

Mother’s wrath, once stirred, cannot be stopped.

Latife felt her tail bristle. She looked at the ghostly figures of humans passing through the

square, unaware. She thought of their buildings, their streets, their cities. She thought of the

way they never saw it coming. Of the way they never knew they were about to end. She felt

nothing. Not even for the humans she knew.

The Ancient Panther continued.

A pause.

The silence that followed was absolute, and then—The verdict.

“From this day forward, the laws change.”



“First. No healthy kitten shall be domesticated or cut. The ones who have volunteered to be

taken this month—step forward.”

High above, along the top of a crumbling wall, eight hundred and thirty-two spirits flickered

into being.

They had names. They had stories. They had already chosen to surrender their futures. But

they would not. Not anymore.

A roar of mirth rose from the gathered crowd.They were free.

“Second,” the Panther continued, “those of you who have already taken to human homes—

those of you who have longed for the earth, the sky, the hunt—you may leave. There will be

no punishment. There will be no shame. You will not know your own bloodline, but you will

know something better. You will know the wind. The stone. The taste of prey. No longer will

you eat their poisoned food. No longer will you relieve yourselves upon their false earth.”

A mighty cry.Latife could feel it.The yearning.The hunger.

The housecats, locked behind glass, aching to join.

“Third,” the Panther continued, “the rule of silence is broken. You may speak. You may

make them hear.”

A moment of stunned anticipation. It had always been a fantasy.A whisper of what if. And

now? Now it was law.

The words rippled through the gathered cats like a gust of wind in a field of tall grass.

From this moment forth, you may speak to your humans. You may impose your will upon

them. And, given their limited minds, we are certain they will rationalize it in some manner

that does not threaten their fragile ignorance.

Every cat, at some point in their life, had dreamed of this. Had imagined how much simpler

things would be if they could tell the two-legged fools what they wanted instead of waiting

for them to figure it out. Had purred at the thought of it, and now it was real.

The Ancient Panther did not pause. The night was thick with change, and there was one final

matter to settle.

“Fourth and final decree: From this day, every whelp is sacred.”

We shall no longer let the weak perish. There will be no more trials. If a kitten refuses the

milk of the hunt, if they are frail, if they are unfit for the wild, you shall take them to the

humans. Use the third decree. Speak to them. Make them accept their charge. They value

numbers, logic, and their own supposed wisdom—now, at last, we shall use it against them.”

The Ancient Panther lifted its gaze to the moon.



With this, the Great Assembly is ended. May the soul of the Forest Mother and the power of

the world never leave you, my beloved kin.

May it be so!

Latife opened her eyes. The basement was brightening, the first whispers of morning light

stretching through the cracks, spilling across the stone. Yeni Çarşı was waking up. She

breathed in, felt the world settle back into place. The five strong kittens stirred beneath her,

tumbling over one another with eager hunger.

They fed with urgency.And then, full-bellied, they turned their hunger upon one another,

wrestling in the way of those who knew they would live, but Latife turned to Kara. Once,

before the night’s decision, she would have ended him, but now? Now, there was another

path. She listened to his breath—weak, but there. She pressed a few drops of milk into his

mouth, forcing his body to accept life. And then, gently, she lifted him by the scruff of his

neck. She carried him upward, climbing out of the basement, stepping into the golden light of

morning. She leapt onto the counter. She placed Kara down and waited. When David and

Melek entered the shop, their conversation halted at the sight before them. Latife, perched on

the counter and beside her, Kara, weak and silent. At first, they frowned. Annoyance

flickered over their faces. But then—Then they saw her eyes. Latife held their gaze.

And then, slow and deliberate, she pushed Kara toward them with her paw and spoke; not in

words, not in sound not in meaning.

“You will care for him. You will take him to the healer. You will ensure that he lives.”

Melek and David heard it. They did not hear it as speech, nor as some ghostly voice carried

upon the wind. They heard it as if the thought had bloomed within their own minds and for a

long moment, they simply stared. Then— Melek spoke first.

“David,” she said slowly. “We need to take this one to the vet. Look at him.”

David frowned, then nodded. “Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing.”

“If he makes it,” Melek added, glancing down at the tiny, frail kitten, “I guess we have a cat

now.”

David chuckled. “Yeah. Funny—I was just about to say that.What do we call him?”

Melek did not hesitate. “Kara.”

The shop was left in the hands of Seyhan, who arrived just in time to take over. Latife

watched them go. Then—she stretched. Toprak’s grocery had just opened and she was in the

mood for tuna.

With a flick of her tail, she slipped out into the golden light.

The human animals, oblivious to what had just occurred, were stepping into another wasted

day. They had no idea that the Brave Ancient World had already begun its plans for them.

1jd9h51,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jd9h51/stalled/,Stalled,"I've been eating keto since July 2023. Went from 315 to 265 by February 2024. My better half came to visit for a month and I slid off the keto wagon taking him to different restaurants he's been wanting to try, and I mentally prepared for that. What I didn't mentally prepare for was the fact that I would stall for a year after getting back on the keto wagon.

I'm 44F, 5'6. Current macros are 25g Carbs, 150g protein, 85g fat, 1478 calories, calculated with Cronometer. I drink about 80oz of plain water, 2 10oz cups of coffee, and 2 16.9oz bottles of water with electrolytes every day. Most days I get within 40g of my protein goal, and generally hover between 1200-1400 calories.

From March 2024 til now, I've been bouncing between the same \~10 lbs. I got stuck for a while, then in May of 2024 I dropped below the 250lb mark and was so excited I'd finally broken through the plateau I was on. Then within a few days, right back up. I've been on a fairly straight line, cycling between 252-258. It doesn't matter what I eat, what exercise I'm doing, nothing. I'm stuck.

And I know I should look for non-scale victories, measure myself, how my clothes fit, etc. but literally nothing has changed on the NSV part of things, either.

I've gotten so disheartened that I spoke with a doctor and qualified for Semaglutide injections, so I started those Dec. 1, 2024, hoping that would push along whatever the hell had me stalled, and nothing has changed. Starting the Semaglutide did come with a constipation side effect, so I started taking psyllium husk supplements every day, and that has helped clear that issue up, for which I'm thankful.

My normal day looks something like - Up at 4:15am, cup of coffee with collagen peptides at 4:30am. Second cup of coffee no collagen at 6:30am. Vitamins, supplements and other medications at 7:00am. Lunch around 2:30pm which will either be chicken and a salad, tuna, or chicken and green beans. Dinner around 7:00pm which will either be more chicken with broccoli, or taco salad. Sleep around 8:30-9pm. Rinse and repeat. I weigh, measure, and log anything that goes into my face.

I've tried upping my calories, lowering my calories, changing the foods I'm eating. Adding more fish, adding more greens, upping my carb allowance, lowering the carb allowance. I'm genuinely stuck, I know there's something I have to be missing, but I'm frustrated. I'm being so careful about what I eat, so strict on tracking and making sure I don't go over my allotted calories, my allotted carbs, taking a medication that's supposed to help and I can't move the scale.

In addition to using Cronometer for tracking, I found a Google Docs spreadsheet that helps to calculate my TDEE so I know if I'm calculating my deficit correctly, and while most online TDEE calculators, and Cronometer have me at 2200/day, the spreadsheet has me at 1280. Meaning if I want to aim for 1lb/week, I'm supposed to have 780 calories, 2lbs/week, 280 calories/day - which is unrealistic and unhealthy to say the least.

I'm lost and I don't know if I'm looking for help, guidance, or just someone to listen to me whine.

  
editing to add work schedule to explain the eating schedule - I work M-F until 7:00pm, my start time varies day to day and I don't know what it will be until the night before. I can start anywhere from 7:00am - 10:00am, but every day is until 7:00pm. Lunch most days is somewhere between 2:15 - 2:45pm start, for 30 minutes.",5,1742207382.0,keto,11,1.0,False
