1qhf94p,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qhf94p/a_welfare_check_i_never_found_an_explanation_for/,A Welfare check I never found an explanation for...,"I was working nights around '09 or '10. Just after midnight, dispatch sent me to a low-priority welfare check - front door open, no history at the address. Quiet neighborhood.

I arrived without lights or siren. Beige two-story house. Porch light on. Front door open about six inches. No damage. Screen door still closed.

I announced myself and went in.

Everything looked normal. Too normal. Couch straightened. Shoes lined up. No smell. No signs of a struggle.

The air felt warm, lived-in warm.

Kitchen light was on. Sink empty. One mug of coffee on the counter. Still warm when I touched it.

Dispatch tried the phone again. No answer. I radioed that I was making entry and asked for backup, non-emergency. Cleared the first floor. Back door was locked - deadbolt and chain latched from the inside.

Upstairs, family photos on the wall. Recent. Kids. Bedrooms neat. One room had a phone charging on the nightstand - warm to the touch.

Bathroom light was on. Fan running. Steam fading on the mirror. No one inside. I shut the fan off and just listened. Everything sounded normal, but the timing felt wrong.

I went back downstairs to wait.

That's when the living room light went out. I didn't see the switch flip. The room just went dark. I checked the lamp. Switch was off.

Backup arrived. We cleared the house again together. Same result. No people. No forced entry. Nothing that made sense. We secured the front door, left a card, and cleared the call. Before we left, my partner pointed at the kitchen counter.

There were two mugs now. Side by side. Both warm.

Neither of us said anything.

Years later, while reviewing old logs for something unrelated, I noticed an addendum added four minutes after we cleared.

Dispatch note:

Second 911 call from same address.

1qhf5gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1qhf5gl/i_ignored_the_warnings_about_a_new_coworker_and/,I Ignored the Warnings About a New Coworker and Accidentally Starred in the Most Toxic Workplace of My Life,"This happened about two years ago, but it is still, without competition, the most toxic workplace I have ever been part of.

A couple years into teaching, we hired a new staff member. I worked with her briefly over the summer and she seemed fine. Quiet. Friendly. Harmless. Other staff members warned me about her and told me not to trust her, but I decided to be a decent human and give her the benefit of the doubt.

Spoiler alert: that was a mistake.

To fully understand how unhinged this became, you need to know what our leadership looked like at the time. Our principal was someone who loved to talk about accountability but never actually practiced it. Students could destroy classrooms without consequences, parents ran the front office, and staff found out important district information last… if at all. Eventually, she was quietly placed on “medical leave” and replaced with an interim principal whose main mission seemed to be “fixing” the building by cracking down on staff. We were immediately labeled lazy, unmotivated, and noncompliant, which was a great morale booster.

Around this time, our school counselor started acting strange. We couldn’t quite pinpoint it, but something was off. Later, we found out she was upset that staff didn’t throw her a bridal shower over the summer. A bridal shower we had offered to throw. One she originally declined. So that was fun.

Not long after, teachers started getting called into the interim principal’s office for “conversations” about things we supposedly said around the building. The weird part was that the principal was never actually around when these conversations happened. However, two people always seemed to be nearby: the counselor and the new hire. Funny how that works.

Slowly, staff began getting reprimanded for microscopic things. The counselor started acting like admin despite very much not being admin. She told teachers how to do their jobs, inserted herself into decisions, and reported people constantly. It felt less like a school and more like a reality show. 

Things hit a boiling point during Spirit Week.

The counselor created a Spirit Week calendar that we were expected to follow. My class wanted to participate but tweak a few things so it felt meaningful for our classroom community. Same themes, just adjusted in a way that worked for my students. Apparently, this was a direct attack on her authority.

She reported me to admin for “overstepping” and “trying to take over Spirit Week.” I explained that it was student-led and meant to build classroom culture. Admin let me off with a warning, but the counselor absolutely saw red and never let it go.

After that, the behavior escalated from petty to genuinely disturbing. She dug through my classroom trash while students were in the room, looking for “evidence” that I threw away her posters. She complained that I didn’t say hi to her in the hallway. She reported teachers for having coffee together in classrooms an hour before school to prep for the day. At this point, it felt like we were one step away from being written up for blinking incorrectly.

The line was crossed when she singled out my child, who attended the school, and made her uncomfortable. That’s when I contacted HR and reported her for creating a hostile work environment. Meanwhile, she was flooding my inbox with emails about how I hurt her feelings and how disappointed she was in me, all while I was actively teaching children.

After HR got involved, I drew a hard boundary. I kept things professional, limited contact, and distanced myself from her entirely. I stayed friendly with the new hire… until admin called me and another teacher into a meeting.

We were told we were making the new hire feel uncomfortable.

We were stunned. We ate lunch together. We talked before and after school. There had been zero indication that there was an issue. That’s when it finally clicked. She had been recording conversations, documenting concerns, and reporting everything to admin. Why? Because she was very close friends with the counselor.

Once we realized what was happening, we cut communication down to strictly work-related topics. That immediately turned into new complaints that we were being cliquey and excluding them. Admin eventually sent a building-wide email discouraging staff from meeting before or after school because it made certain people feel left out. Yes. Really.

HR stepped in again. The counselor was told to stay out of my workspace and was eventually moved to a different building for the following school year.

The new hire stayed, and somehow things got worse.

She was hired as an interventionist, but instead of providing interventions, she talked to students about her own depression, how hard her life was when she was their age, and generally used intervention time as free therapy for herself. Students were put on devices or not pulled at all for their required minutes. She routinely showed up late, worked on her doctorate during school hours, and ignored her actual responsibilities. Meanwhile, kids weren’t meeting their learning goals, and admin refused to listen because staff had already been branded as “difficult.”

Despite all of this, she was promoted to a half-time interventionist and half-time instructional coach. Watching someone who actively avoided her job become responsible for “coaching” teachers was… something.

After that, we started noticing even more. She belittled staff, made racially inappropriate comments, created wildly inappropriate relationships with students, and spent more time making giant posters than doing anything she was actually paid to do. Several staff members were moved to different buildings due to her claims of harassment.

I eventually left the school. I refused to stay in a building that protected manipulative adults and punished teachers who were trying to advocate for kids.

The last update I heard was almost poetic. New staff and admin quickly turned on her. She tried the same tactics, made new claims, and even attempted to get admin fired. This time, it backfired. She lost her coaching position and was essentially forced out of elementary education due to her reputation in the district.

She now works at a high school.

And honestly, I hope someone there is watching closely.

TL;DR: I ignored warnings about a new coworker and ended up in the most toxic school environment imaginable. She and a counselor manipulated admin, recorded conversations, neglected students, and caused multiple teachers to be disciplined or transferred. I left. She eventually lost her promoted position and was pushed out of elementary education.",1,1768853300.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False
1qhf5g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qhf5g0/i_hate_how_i_spend_moneyi_got_a_bag_i_dont_even/,i hate how i spend money/i got a bag i dont even want,"this is kind of a dumb vent when i really think about it and type it out, but whatever :,’) i am very privileged to vent about something like this haha. 

i (20f) have recognized that i will just buy things for a dopamine rush, or so i have something to look forward to (which is a problem in itself, i know). i have accumulated a great amount of vinyl, books, bags have spent so much on video games and skins (also a bunch on gacha games) when i recognize that i genuinely do not need to be spending money on these things (don’t even get me started on all of the coffee shop drinks). 

for all things considered, i shouldn’t be as i am spending so much money on tuition (through monthly payments, roughly 1.6k monthly). i used to be much better at saving, at one point accumulating around 5k in savings (not saying this is great) but between jobs, i lost it from paying tuition and just buying other stupid stuff i didn’t need.  

i also got a credit card which i recognize is a problem in itself too hahah. i need to lock it in a box and throw away the key. recently, when i am not doing schoolwork/working i spend so much of my time scrolling and shopping online because i have convinced myself it is “easier” than pursuing any of my old hobbies.. which is really sad, lol

anyways. back to the root of this vent and what made me evaluate all of these things: i am apart of a facebook group that sells a brand of bags. there was a comment underneath a post that had been selling a particular bag that i once really wanted, and i had actually bought from this seller before with no issues. 

this morning, i (regrettably) commented and asked if it was still available, and they messaged me and said it was. the seller named their price (around $110), and i (regrettably) said that was a good price. we conversed about the payment and shipping information (which the seller knew from the last transaction), and i said i would send the payment over. they said they would ship tomorrow. 

after around ten minutes, i hadn’t sent over any money yet, and i hated myself for being that person. i typed out a long winded, very apologetic message of how i actually really didn’t need this bag, and that i needed to be more financially aware, alongside how sorry i was. i was literally staring at the ceiling fighting my anxiety trying to form this message. i am so non confrontational, and i almost wanted to block them and pretend it never happened.

nonetheless, to my dismay, they sent a screenshot of the shipping information. i felt so guilty. i hadn’t even sent over the money, and they had said they would be shipping tomorrow.. they literally shipped it in less than 10 minutes! i know it is my fault for even inquiring about it in the first place, and i should have just told the seller i was actually uninterested as soon as i even felt a trickle of guilt - but i hate that i do this to myself :( i am my own worst enemy. 

anyways, i have a new bag coming in the mail soon, and i am out $110 dollars. i really liked it, but now all i see in it is financial regret and sadness :( ",1,1768853298.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Deep Cleaning always brings out my Nostalgic Side, and unlike last time, this one's a bit longer, long enough to enjoy a Beer/Drink/Smoke/Toke/Poke/wtvr.  So sit back and enJoy your inToxicant of Choice for a lil more Unkle Guido Story Time:

As we approached 2020 before the Rest of the World deCompensated, I had a Forced Purge of over 90% of all my Worldly Possessions, including my Magickal/Ritual Objects & Library (Fenwick has the other 91%+ of the latter 2 from this Purge).  PLZ Note that I think nearly all were purchased in the 1900s.  Whilst I recently Shared my ""Current Altar"" a Week or 2 ago, I thought I'd Share what remains of my Physical Library.  This isn't nearly the Loss it initially seemed, particularly given my EyeSight anymore pretty much requires Reading to be done on my TV Screen so I can Zoom, and I've more than rePlaced all relevant Books - plus a TON more - since coming back online in 2022.  I will **BOLD** Titles I HIGHLY Recommend, for your cornvenience.

What you see above is the less than 10% I Kept, and although there are some absolute Gems in the form of Essential Books, there are also a dozen or so that I've no clue How/Why they got Kept when other notable Titles I AM Missing still, but whatever.

I'll start w/ the most Western Books, so we're going to Ignore the Bottom Right Books on I Ching & Start with the Horizontal Books.  These are all that remains from my old University Texts, half of which I mentioned over the Weekend, so I won't reCount those, either, other than to state that the unMarked Books below the Psych Text on ""Death and Dying"" are Dr. Dale Cannon's Personally-Made TextBooks for his Eastern & Western Religions Classes.  He had a Field Trip to Portland for each Class, going to 3-5 Different Houses of Worship, including to a Shaivite Hindu Temple, a Mosque, a Synagogue, Buddhist Temples, &c.  I Selfishly took advantage of Dr. Cannon's Sagacity that I also possess, Asking him Pointed Questions that are only tangentially related to the Day's CourseWork that only an XPert like himself would know.  As Sages like to say, ""This IS The Short Version!""  I could get him & my old German Teacher who used to Translate for the Allies to wax nostalgic like a PRO, Answering Personal Curiosity over actual CourseWorlk LOL smh

The Book on ""Creativity"" is a Classic, and was a Text for a class on Creativity that I Flunked despite Sharing (at least a close variation of) Pope Pete's Gnostic Pentagram Ritual with the Class, per Teacher Request LOL  TBF, I deserved an F - my Life was getting pretty Out-of-Control Chaotic during that term LOL

For those who were around just over a year ago will remember the 22 Days I did Daily Meditations on each of the 22 Trumps w/ the 1st Book on the Top Left leading up to Autumnal Equinox in 2024, Sallie Nichols' AMAZING Book, **""Jung & Tarot: An Archetypal Journey""**.  That Simple ""Runes Workbook"" has more Creative XurSizes than most Rune Books twice its thickness, but TBH I mainly use it due to it having a cheat-sheet of the Elder FUThARK on the inside back cover I can quickly refer to in just a few seconds.  Yup, even HIGH Wyzard™s use Cheat-Sheets!  Usually depending upon How HIGH, but getting back on topic, **""Helrunar""** is absolutely the Most reRead-Thru & Highest Recommended of these Books.  I already knew of Automatic Writing from my early days preOccult via Hypnosis, and not being very Visual, ""Visual Magick"" is my least-liked of my Jan Fries Books.  Sadly - even though it would go with the I Ching Books - I canNOT find my **""Living Midnight""**!  Fortunately, I have all of these+ on my HD.

Next you see Pope Pete's 3 Main Chaos Magick Books, followed by Phil Hine's 2.  Bill Whitcomb Signed my copy of his ""Magician's Reflection"" when Taylor Ellwood took me over to Bill's Home for Dinner.  Bill was the consummate Host & Fellow Mage w/ AMAZING Conversation, as usually happens when I'm around Others like these 2, Fenwick, &c.

I think I kept ""The Kybalion"" as my ""Token og Occulte' Booke"".  Frater U.D.'s Book, **""Secrets of Western Sex Magick""** is a Classic for many Reasons.  It also Works a bit as a Chaos Magick Primer in many Ways, e.g., with Creating Sigils, &c.  Next are some Books on NLP & Memetics that I got before anyone could pronounce the word ""Meme"" without sounding like a Repetitive Narcissist, notably NOT the resources that I Learned either from, lest a false impression be given.  ""Wilson & Unruh"" are both Chaotes I used to know well (online) and was happy to support their Book, 1 of the 1st on Memetics at the time, I'd wager.

RAW's (RIP) Book **""Prometheus Rising""** is 1 of my absolute Fave Books of All Time, and ""Angel Tech"" takes a different approach to the 6th & 7th Circuits (must... resist... 67 Meme...).  When I told Fenwick that I didn't find ""Quantum Psychology"" nearly as Mind-Blowing, he told me that's due to me having already Internal-Ized E-Prime via NLP Practices, and this does seem to hold-up LOL

Jason Augustus Newcomb was just coming into the Occult-Scene when I had passed by main Book-Hoarding Years, and of the Books I've seen w/ Complete & Comprehensive Esoteric Educations given, I'd rate ""New Hermetics"" up there w/ the various Models that Pope Pete gives in his a3mentioned Books, although I've not personally done more than Read Thru it all decades ago.

**""Life 101""** was 1 of the Pop Psychology Books that I have found so inValuAble for my own MH/Mental Health that I think I'd have to rate it as my single FAVOURITE - or at least MOST USED/REFERENCED - Book I own.  It's the 1st Book (just above RAW's **""Prometheus Rising""**) I'd want on a Deserted Island.

This Row Ends with my remaining Books on Native American Shamanism.  I almost wanna BOLD Don Miguel Ruiz's 2 Books, but I don't think they quite get the A+ that BOLD deserves.  I still HIGHLY Recommend both Books - well worth the short amount of time it takes to go thru them both, and he does offer a very UseFull Model that I've personally Used to Great Results.  We finish with some Books on Coyote cuz Coyote FTW!

[remnants of my og Library's Martial & Eastern Books, along w\/ my old Art\/Coffee Table Books](https://preview.redd.it/7n4hxkoszceg1.jpg?width=1329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df422dbe52dd619714553242b95ce54e8e76e469)

For the Eastern Books, continuing along the Top Row:

""The Book of Five Rings"" needs no introduction, nor does the ""Art of Peace"" - I'm not sure where my ""Art of War"" went.  If you like ""Mudras"" you should get that Book, and it's one of my Faves & Most Referenced.  My Father got me the Eckhart Tolle Book, which is about as woo-woo as he gets.  From what I skimmed, it seemed like ""Mysticism for Dummies"" to me at the time so I never really got into him, but Pops liked Deepak Chopra and the like, so, eh, close enough I guess.  Any Chaote would be better served Reading Part I of Crowley's Liber ABA/Book 4 on Mysticism that I just finished & recently mentioned herein this sub.  The Row was supposed to transition to Dzogchen, then to the Dalai Lama's Book on Dzogchen, but size didn't allow.  I STILL have not the faintest Clue about Dzogchen, but rumour is that it's perhaps the single Quickest & Most Efficient Way to an enLightened, NonDual ASC, but I've yet to Read Thru them to verify this - let alone Apply it.  We Complete this Row with the Dalai Lama's Book - my 3rd Fave Book for a Deserted Island that I canNOT Recommend STRONGLY ENOUGH - on **""The Art of Happiness""**.  Pops got me this Book too - years before I'd see the Dalai Lama LIVE! - along with copies for all his Friends & Family.  I Agreed, and did the same for all my Friends & Family, including Fenwick and my other Brothers.  I.e.:

Those are the 3 Books I STRONGLY RECOMMEND to EVERYONE, in that Order:

**1: Life 101**  
**2: Prometheus Rising, &**  
**3: The Art of Happiness**j

Corntinuing the Library Tour of my Eastern Books, in the Middle Left we have a Horizontal stack of most of the Books I refer to when I Use I Ching, although I'm Notably missing Jan Fries' **""Living Midnight""** and 1 or 2 others.  I rather like the Top Book (in addition to the others) for Breaking Down the Chinese Pictograms(?) used for each Hexagram, giving more Meanings to draw from.  I do similar w/ my Runic Books from above, when I'd Toss Runes for Divinations.

Middle Right we have all of my Martial Arts Books.  The **""Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere""** was long a Fave of mine & my Sifu, and if you're into Soft Martial Forms at all, this Book is a BOLDED MUST-HAVE AFAIC  **""The Dao of Taijiquan""** by Jou, Tsung Hwa is amazing, but I've never gotten their ""The Dao of I Ching"".  People frequently falsely think that Taiji doesn't apply to ""Real"" Martial Arts/Self Defense.**""Tai Chi Chuan--24 & 48 Postures with Martial Applications""** by Master Liang, Shou-Yu & Wu, Wen-Ching will quickly shut down such any such Ignorant AssUmptions.  This last Title would complete what I'd consider my Top 3 Martial Arts Books I own.  IIRC the Authors of the 2 Bottom Books are also Legit, that's Liang & Wu re: the Bottom, w/ Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming the Author on Shaolin Chin-Na.

On the Bottom are what used to be my ""Coffee Table/Art Books"" when I lived in a Home w/ space for a Coffee Table, including Books on Art from Picasso, Keith Haring, Erotic Art, and my Fave Artist of these, Salvador Dali.  ""The Mystical Arts of Tibet"" is a photographic collection of The Dalai Lama's personal Ritual Items.  I LOL @ ""The Golden Game""s collection of 16th Century Alchemical Wood Engravings because I never thought I'd return to Western Hermeticism - yet here I am LOL

There ya have, a whirlwind tour of most of the HighLights from my og Physical Library.  What do you think?

I’m 21 (born 2004), male, and the kind of person who’s awkward at first but it’s not on purpose it’s just “talking stages” that get me. I’m loyal, thoughtful, and nerdy. I love deep conversations, creating things with my hands, and getting lost in stories. Whether that’s a show, a game, or someone’s life story. I’m a romantic at heart and I believe love should feel safe, intentional, and mutual.

Looks:

Black hair (currently in twists), Black, glasses, 5’10”, 195–200 lbs, coffee-colored eyes, double pierced ears, and one tattoo (with more planned).

Hobbies & Interests:

3D printing, video games, woodworking, crafting random projects, cooking, walking, watching shows/movies, hanging with friends, and spending time with my dog. If you like someone who’s always building or learning something, that’s me.

Work / School:

I’m currently in university working toward a mechanical engineering degree. I also work as a paid intern at a paper mill until I graduate(not my dream field, but it pays really well so f- it why not).

Me as a Partner:

I’m attentive and affectionate. I’ll cook for you, check in on you, send good morning and goodnight texts, and share things that remind me of you. I’ll hype you up, support your goals, and listen when you need to talk. I’m protective in a caring way, emotionally present, and I show love through actions as much as words.

What I’m Looking For:

Someone kind, emotionally aware, and genuine. I want a connection where we can be comfortable in silence, laugh easily, talk about life at 2 a.m., go on little adventures, hit the gym together, or just exist side by side. I’m open to different backgrounds and cultures I care more about who you are than checking boxes. Distance doesn’t matter because I believe the one for me could be anyone and anywhere, but of course I’d love to be able to hold your hand in the future.

\- sturdy, I want it to be able to last daily life for a while at least 

Issues I’ve had:

\- weak cup holders breaking easily

\- cup holders only holding one size

\- a weaker cup holder is fine if I can remove it easily but I’ve had too many that are too hard to remove and break in transit 

\- not being truly stable and letting cups shake too much 

I think my biggest issue is the cup holders I try (for bikes and strollers) just aren’t built for a wheelchair life. What’s the cup holders you have used and how have they been? 

And size wise, is it truly best to have two? One for my mugs and cups at home and one for a bigger size bottle (like my Stanley) for when I’m out?

Talking to his dad at the solstice really made him think about leadership. Sam had mentioned forming a rescue squad consisting of hippocampi to his dad, who had been very proud of him for that, but to Sam, leading a bunch of fish wasn’t the same as being a big brother.

The son of Poseidon had lost track of which siblings were at camp and which ones weren’t. For once, Sam couldn’t blame it on his own stupidity. His siblings had been really confusing. On purpose, Sam swore.

Sam put a tray with drinks and snacks from his personal stash on the coffee table and just like last time, he barricaded the rest of the cabin. He didn’t want any of the visitors snooping around. This year, he wanted to break his record for going days without getting unreasonably angry, and he wasn’t about to let some idiots ruin it.

Sam waited for his siblings to join him in the cabin’s common room, flipping through a soccer magazine. Regardless of his brothers joining him or not, Sam started the cabin meeting. It could well be that he would be talking to himself, but he often did that.

‘’Right. Hey guys, hope you had a great winter holiday. I loved mine. I saw Dad again, and I went home to celebrate Christmas. And then when I got back, people had to leave for Fort Knox. None of you went, right?’’ Sam scanned the room, particularly for his brother Nam. He didn’t like the idea of his younger brother throwing himself into danger.

‘’I’m thinking about picking up the counselor role this season.’’ Sam snacked on some paprika-flavored potato chips as he announced this. The idea of being a counselor used to terrify him, but since he had the most experience in the entire cabin, he might as well give it a shot. He could teach camp all about the greatest sport known to mankind. ‘’Anyone we should form an alliance with?’’

‘’I was wondering if there’s been anything you’ve had issues with? People or demigod stuff, whatever. If you need advice, I’m here.’’ Sam spoke rather quickly. He was here for advice, but knowing him, it might not be good advice. ‘’Oh, and we’re maybe expecting visitors later. I don’t know.’’

After Sam got the chance to speak to his siblings, he opened the cabin’s doors for curious people to come and have a look at the cabin. People who wanted to see what it was like in Poseidon’s cabin, people who wanted to form alliances, or people who wanted to bother the good old Poseidon kids.

1qhez3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qhez3i/i_kicked_my_friend_out_of_my_house_for_violating/,I kicked my friend out of my house for violating my privacy and never contacted her again.,"I 27F had this happen over a year ago. My friend from college let's call her ""Carol"" same age, and I have stayed in contact via once a month calls and maybe twice a year visits over the years as we have both started our careers. Up until the incident in question she had not been my favorite person all the time (she was my roommate in college for a couple months and we both agreed we weren't compatible as roommates), but we stayed in touch and both made an effort to visit eachother when we could (we live about 4hrs apart). 

For background leading up to what happened, in our monthly calls she had been having issues with her boyfriend who we'll call ""Joe"" (who we also went to college with but is in a different field). He was struggling with mental health, alcohol and substance use, and she was supporting both of them financially since he quit his job over a year ago. As a somewhat distanced friend I did not feel comfortable giving her too much advice but instead mostly just listened and encouraged her to discuss her feelings with him. I would also bring up therapy for both of them and tell her that while I liked Joe, she came first to me and she didnt seem happy. In our most recent call she thought things were improving slightly but that he was still refusing to take necessary steps. She had also started seeing a therapist which seemed to me to be helping her work through all of it (although she wanted to go to couples counselling and at the time he refused). Carol sounded frustrated and clear headed, wanting to have a talk with him about how worried she was and how he wasn't improving or taking steps to improve. I asked questions and told her that although I didn't think I was very qualified to give advice, that I was her friend and no matter what issues he was going through or how much she loved him that she was allowed to have her own feelings, that she had her own needs, and she didnt deserve to be used. I told her that from my perspective my friend had been suffering through a nonrecipricol relationship for a very long time. She admitted that she was willing to do alot to help him change and she didn't want to leave him but that she might have to because she felt like she was enabling his behavior by staying.

About a week later, she called me on a Tuesday. She was crying and sounded like a mess. She asked if she could come stay with me and my husband at our house. She said she had had a talk with Joe and she couldn't go home that night. I was a bit thrown off and had alot of questions about what had happened and logistics but realizing my friend was in obvious need I decided we'd figure that out later. I said ""Yes, the answer is yes, of course you can stay with us"" In all honesty I wasnt happy about this because my husband and I had planned a two week vacation starting the following week (she knew this from our last call). I reminded her of the trip, then asked her if I needed to come up and get her, and if she was okay (at the time I assumed the worst about the situation). She assured me she was just upset, that she would grab some things and text me once she was on the road and that she had to get back to work. I wanted to ask more but was also working, and didn't want to push for answers when she obviously was in a rough state.

She got to my house and we talked. I live in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom house with my husband and two dogs. My husband and I had managed to shuffle stuff around and clear our guest bedroom for her to stay and get groceries I knew she would eat (as shes a very picky eater). He left us alone and I got her and her cat settled in and basically held her as she cried. She told me that she had an ultimatum with Joe and that she needed him to take steps to improving his mental health, take responsibility, and quit drinking. She also realized that she was enabling his behaviors so she was going to leave until he took those steps and they were on a break. I asked if anything happened during the conversation (I was very worried from how she spoke on the call that something had happened to her) she assured me that no, nothing had happened she was just emotional about the whole thing. She told me her work was allowing her to work remote so after getting that situated she had called me as her first visit on the relationship break. I asked how long she thought she would stay (she did not ask me or offer this information). She said 3-4 WEEKS. This meant she would be at my house while I was gone on vacation, something I was not entirely comfortable with but I trusted her and did not express any hesitation to her. I asked if she was still paying rent for her apartment where Joe was living, she said yes as it wasn't about the money but about him getting better. I asked how she could afford that, she said that she could stay with friends and family rent free so it wouldn't actually change her finances, that she would be staying with other people for around a month but depending on the situation might come back to stay with me (she did not ask). I asked her why Joe wasn't the one leaving temporarily, she said he didn't have friends or family to stay with that weren't toxic and would make the situation worse. I tried to gently ask her why her paying his rent and groceries wasn't still enabling him but she brushed it aside saying it wasn't like that because it wasn't about the money and since she wasn't physically there it was different.

 Not going to lie, I was a bit annoyed. My friend showed up, smelling like she hadn't showered in a week, with a car full of her stuff including her cat which she didnt tell me initially about, without the kind of crisis I had been stressing and worrying about all day (which I wished I had asked or she had clarified on the phone), having not even actually gone through a full break up after so long dealing with Joe's lack of change, not asking but telling me what she needed, and not offering anything in return (not that I actually wanted anything just that she bluntly stated she wasnt going to rubbed me the wrong way). I decided that just because it seemed that way to me it was obviously a big deal to her and she was still processing and I shouldn't feel this way. To be clear, I kept all of this to myself.

Over the next two days my husband and I were busy working and packing for our trip. Carol approached me before we left and asked if she could do anything around the house while we were gone. I took this as an offer to pay us back in some way and that my earlier feelings were jumping to conclusions. I told her she didn't have to and wasn't expected to do anything but she said she would be bored without something to do. I know she likes organizing as a hobby and has tried to do it professionally for people before. I asked her if she would be interested in organizing my pantry. She and I walked through my kitchen and I told her where things currently went and what stuff she could go through. She asked good questions about what I was and was not okay with and I said most of the kitchen stuff was fair game. I also told her my office (I work from home) and my bedroom were specifically off limits and I didn't really want her messing with my art supplies (in their own designated area). I didn't press these things as I thought it was pretty self explanatory. I also reiterated that she wasn't expected to, and any small organizing she did would be great.

My husband and I left. While on our road trip I received a text asking about throwing away some expired stuff in my pantry which I answered. I also checked in occasionally on how she was doing. Our trip ended up being cut short so we were going to get home 4 days early, which I informed her of. The day before we were going to arrive home she texted me that Joe was going to come by and was dropping off their dog. This seemed odd but I didn't question it at the time, although later thinking back if our trip had gone as long as we had planned he would have showed up and been at my house while I wasn't there. Also she would have had a dog and a cat when we came home from picking up our own two dogs (being watched by friends).

Not that it's particularly relevant but our vacation ended up not being very relaxing. For various reasons I was stressed and did not look forward to entertaining anyone but instead wanted to come home to my house and my life and have a few days to get some chores done before going back to work.

We got home and everything was a mess, she'd completely taken everything out of the kitchen and it was all over the living room, she had made a makeshift table with sawhorses that had everything from my kitchen cupboards and drawers and pantry on it, she had not finished organizing a single thing, and as she showed me what she did she took my husband and I into my office where she had ""organized"" my desk and taken paperwork and other bits out into the living room for further sorting. She had also gone through our bedroom and our bathroom. Somewhere in here she also mentioned that Joe would be coming in a couple days with the dog but would actually be staying for a day or two. I was holding back tears, and disassociating so I think I just nodded along. She was pretty oblivious to this. My husband saw I was upset and told her we were tired and going to bed. I didn't know what to do, I thought I was overreacting and not in the right head space. But the more I thought about it the more angry I was, Carol had gone through all my work stuff (She and I both work in a field where NDAs are taken very seriously so if I had had sensitive information it could have potentially lost me my job), she had gone through my desk where I keep banking info, passwords, personal and medical records, my journal (which I dont share with anyone), she had gone through our bedroom and bathroom cabinets, our laundry, medications, my husband and my toiletries (she had moved everything).  Although she texted about some expired can of beans in my pantry she didnt think to send a quick text about any of the rest of it? And to top it off she had been planning to have her boyfriend, the reason she was staying with me in the first place come with their dog into my now torn appart house with stacks of my sensitive information sitting on the coffee table (originally when I wasnt even going to be home) and he was going to stay? Spend the night? I am the kind of person that doesn't want my parents (who I trust implicitly) to come by my house when its messy and/or I'm not there.

 The next day I talked to my husband and then my best friend about how mad I was and they both reassured me I was valid. They also said Carol was my friend and it affected me more than my husband so they would understand any decision I would make on how to handle it. My husband and I ended up going on a drive for awhile and I broke down to him on the way home. He told me that I didn't have to handle it and although I'm not proud of this I asked him if he could talk to her. When we got home I went into my office with the door closed and crawled under my desk and cried. I hated how I didn't handle it myself but at that moment was in the middle of a panic attack. My husband came in and told me he talked to her and that she had to leave by the end of the week, that we weren't comfortable with how she handled our privacy and belongings and we weren't able to accommodate her boyfriend or dog at the moment (things we had discussed and I was on the same page on). He said she took it well and that she had asked if I was okay which he told her ""she's just upset right now but will probably want to talk to you later"".

After I had calmed down enough he took me to dinner. I didn't see Carol at all when we left the house. When we got back she had packed and left. She sent me a text that said ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you. I've left"". We proceeded to reorganize everything and clean the guest bedroom which took all weekend.

I haven't talked to her since and she has not reached out to me besides that last text. My husband is fully supportive of me but also encouraged me to reach out and explain since he thought it would grant me some closure and 'no one learns or grows if no one points out their behavior to them. And it might help her in future friendships to realize why you're cutting her off.' and while I agree to an extent I still haven't reached out. While I don't think I'm wrong for setting restrictions in my own house, I do feel guilty for how I handled it (in that I had my husband do it for me) and that I never talked to her about it afterwards. Especially given the timing of everything since I basically ended a friendship while she was in the middle of a pseudo-breakup. Also, she historically has been bad at understanding social norms and I think I could have either locked doors or been firmer about my boundaries before the trip but I honestly thought at the time that casually telling her I didn't want her to go into my bedroom or office was enough.

If you read the whole thing thanks for letting me rant, sorry it's so long. I also don't plan on reaching out to her at this point, I wrote most of this shortly after it happened and figured it might be fun to post now and see what others think.

TLDR my friend staying at my house after a relationship issue, went through all of my personal items including paperwork for my job, banking info, medications, etc as a part of 'organizing'. We asked her to leave early and I've never talked to her again.

Not my apartment. Not our apartment. Her apartment. The one she'd been renting for eight months using our money while I thought we were saving for a house. The one where I found her affair partner's clothes in the closet, his toothbrush by the sink, and a framed photo of them on the nightstand.

I found it by accident. Complete accident. My wife told me she had a work dinner and would be home late. I was grabbing coffee near her office around 7pm when I saw her getting into her car. I almost called out to her but something felt off. She looked nervous. Kept checking her phone. So I followed her.

She drove twenty minutes across town to this apartment complex I'd never seen before. Parked. Went inside. I waited ten minutes then went to the building entrance. The directory showed her last name on unit 304. Her maiden name. The one she stopped using three years ago when we got married.

I should have left. But I had the main door code because someone was coming out and I caught it. Took the elevator up. Knocked on 304.

She answered. Face went white.

""What are you doing here.""

Not a question. A statement. Like I was the one in the wrong place.

""What am I doing here? What the hell is this place?""

She tried to block the doorway but I could see past her. Men's shoes by the door. A leather jacket I'd never seen. Then some guy walked out from the bedroom. Tall. Younger than me. Wearing sweatpants and nothing else.

""Babe who is it,"" he said. Then he saw me. ""Oh shit.""

My wife grabbed my arm. ""We need to talk about this somewhere else.""

I pulled away from her. ""Talk about what? About how you're spending our money on a love nest? About how you've been lying to me for months?""

""It's not like that.""

""Then what is it like?""

The guy started putting on a shirt. My wife turned to him. ""Go in the bedroom. Please.""

""I'm not going anywhere until someone explains what the hell I'm looking at,"" I said.

She got this look on her face. Defensive. Angry almost. ""You have no right to follow me. This is my private space.""

""Your private space? I just checked our bank account on my phone. We've been paying $1800 a month for this place. That's our money. My money. For what, so you can play house with this guy?""

The affair partner came back out, fully dressed now. ""Look man, I didn't know she was married.""

My wife spun around. ""Don't talk to him.""

""You told me you were divorced,"" he said to her. ""You said it was finalized last year.""

That hit different. She wasn't just cheating. She'd built an entire fake life. Told this guy she was single while coming home to me every night.

""Get out,"" she said to me. ""This is my apartment and you're not welcome here.""

""Your apartment? Check the bank statement. Check who's been paying for this.""

She followed me into the hallway. The guy stayed inside. She pulled the door closed behind her.

""I need space to think,"" she said.

""Space to think.""

""Yes. About us. About what I want. This has been really confusing for me.""

I actually laughed. Couldn't help it. ""Confusing for you.""

""Don't be like this. You're making this harder than it needs to be.""

""I'm making this hard? You've been lying to me for months. You spent our savings on an apartment for another man. And I'm the one making this difficult?""

She crossed her arms. ""I think we should separate for a while. Give me time to figure out what I want.""

""You want space? Fine. You've got all the space you want now.""

I took out my phone right there in the hallway. Opened the banking app. Started removing her access to every account.

""What are you doing,"" she said.

""Giving you space. Without my money.""

""You can't do that. That's our money.""

""Was our money. Now it's my money. You can pay for your little love apartment yourself.""

Her face changed. Panic mode. ""Wait. Stop. We can talk about this.""

""Nothing to talk about. You wanted space to think. Go think. In your apartment. That you'll be paying for.""

I canceled the joint credit cards while walking to my car. Transferred everything from joint savings to my personal account. Changed the passwords on every shared account we had. By the time I got home she'd called me fourteen times.

I didn't answer.

She showed up at the house two hours later. I'd already changed the locks. She banged on the door.

""Let me in. I live here.""

I opened the door but stood in the doorway. ""Not anymore you don't.""

""You can't kick me out of my own house.""

""Check the deed. House is in my name. My parents helped with the down payment. You're not on it.""

Her face crumpled. Started crying. ""Please. I made a mistake. Can we just talk about this?""

""You made a lot of mistakes. For eight months. Using my money the whole time.""

""Where am I supposed to go?""

""You have an apartment. Go there.""

""I can't afford that place on my own.""

""Then I guess you better talk to your boyfriend about splitting rent.""

She tried to push past me. I blocked her. ""I'm getting my things.""

""No you're not. Everything in this house was bought with my money. You can come back tomorrow with a police escort if you want your personal items.""

""This is insane. You're being cruel.""

""I'm being cruel? You've been living a double life for almost a year and I'm the cruel one?""

She left. Kept calling. I blocked her number. She started texting from other numbers. Her mom called me. Her sister. I blocked all of them.

Two days later I got served with separation papers. She was demanding half of everything. The house. The cars. My retirement account. All of it.

I got a lawyer. A good one. Brought all the bank statements showing the apartment payments. Showed the text messages I'd found on the cloud where she'd been coordinating with the affair partner. Showed proof that the house was solely in my name.

Her lawyer tried to argue she was entitled to marital assets. My lawyer pointed out that she'd been fraudulently spending marital funds on an extramarital affair for eight months and that I had grounds for a fault divorce.

The affair partner dumped her three weeks into the separation. She called me from yet another number begging to reconcile.

""I ended things with him. We can start over. Go to counseling. Fix this.""

""There's nothing to fix. You destroyed this marriage. Now you get to live with it.""

""I was confused. I made mistakes. But I love you. I want to come home.""

""You don't have a home here anymore.""

She started showing up at my work. My gym. My parents' house. I filed for a restraining order. Got it approved.

The divorce finalized last month. She got nothing. No house. No cars. No retirement. She had to pay her own legal fees. The judge was not sympathetic to someone who'd committed financial infidelity while carrying on an affair.

Last I heard she's living with her parents and working two jobs to pay off the credit card debt she racked up trying to maintain her fake life.

My parents think I should have been more forgiving. That everyone makes mistakes. That marriage is about working through hard times.

But I keep thinking about her face when she told me I had no right to be at ""her apartment."" The one I was paying for. The entitlement. The nerve to ask for space to think after getting caught.

AITA for cutting her off completely and making sure she got nothing in the divorce?

I find myself asking this question more frequently as I feel myself getting annoyed/frustrated at my partners spending habits. I will start by saying first off we both are fortunate to be on good incomes and we do not have any significant debts and are able to save at the end of each month.

My partner has the mentality that any money she has not set aside as part of her “budget” she can spend without much thought, as she has already done the “budgeting” beforehand, whereas I will evaluate each spend on its own merits, which I admit can be more mentally taxing.

So, when it comes to things like groceries, my partner will buy the items she wants without shopping around and get it from the local Sainsbury’s when she feels like it rather than planning ahead and getting the same items cheaper at the big supermarket when we do our weekly shopping, or wait until the item is on offer.

Same with buying other “discretionary” items (like a new coffee machine/set of earphones etc), if my partner feels she wants something, she will often just buy it even if waiting a few months means she could get it on sale for cheaper. And for example with things like clothes, if the same item has one colour on sale, my partner might still chose the other colour not on sale as they prefer that colour.

Also she is generally more willing to pay for convenience/comfort, such as getting a food delivery when it would be cheaper to go collect, paying to upgrade her seat for flights whereas I would be more reluctant to do such things.

I have had conversations about this with my partner and she feels that I am being too frugal and am allowing money to create more problems in our life. I feel that there is truth to this and so was wondering how others on this sub deal with treading the line between positive frugality and being too frugal, and also how to deal with the negative emotions which come with not always getting a “good deal”.",0,1768852804.0,UKFrugal,4,0.4,False

Thinking in Classical Greek. Thinking in Homer and in Plato and in Nietzsche. I imagine by this time he had already gotten into Houellebecq, and obviously he loves David Lynch in part because Twin Peaks is one of the closest depictions of the Ensouled and Poetic Reality he dwells in, he also gives the impression of being someone who enjoys Weird Fiction in general especially Cosmic Horror; Lovecraft and Ligotti wouldn’t be surprised if he was into Burroughs (before getting into Celine, maybe I’m wrong but I imagine Burroughs came first) and Clive Barker.

Again super lonely. Spending years of his life working on a dissertation. A year later the whole cultural landscape shifts within academia. Leo Strauss and Strauss’ students (both the ones that stayed in academy and the ones who got into positions of political power and loudly rocked their prestigious credentials as “students” of Leo Strauss... meaning they took a class with him one semester) are scapegoated for the Iraq War. The only Straussians left are geriatrics entombed within their respective departments. Tenure being the name of the magical formulae that binds their form and privileges. Still they are marginal. Again super lonely. Spending years of his life working on a dissertation.

Just a few weeks ago he spaced out in front of a night club. Basking in the stillness of neon putrescence. In this place he becomes Nemo. Run by mobsters and perverts and off-duty cops. Heaven is High and the Emperor is far away. Spooks darting between street lights. People turning into corners, disappearing. Can feel the rumbling of some mummified saint in a three-piece suit propped up in a booth, guarded by smudged plexiglass, coated in gold-leaf glimmering in perpetual LED glow of the e-candles and Christmas lights, two unlit cigarettes dangling from blackened leather lips. Considered paying a visit. Lighting a joss stick and reading aloud the articles from the titty-mags left as an offering. The saint is of a kingly character. Joyful and gregarious and always ready to receive company, capable of turning all company into good company. The aminos were kicking in. Glycine along with the 600mg of theanine preceded and proceeded by scholarly amounts of coffee. The sun having become his enemy, he found sanctuary in desolation and in ill-repute. Stared at the bouncer by the door. Wondered what it would be like to be him. Imposing frame under leather jacket with military-style epaulettes. There was a kindness and softness in the man’s eyes. His gaze veered off to one of the apartment buildings on the side of the road. There was just one light turned on in the middle of the building and his mind wandered to who lived there and what they were like, and then to how it would be if he was the boy or girl who lived there.

* “Many times I’ve wished, not so much that I was someone else, nor that I was immortal, but that I could live many different lives simultaneously and not be limited to being only one thing. At such moments of mood where you’re both calm and at least feel free every detail of life becomes interesting, all takes the character of images from a peaceful dream that present themselves in turn and don’t move you one way or another, because you see through them. I wonder then at least as a zoological experiment what it would be like to be a Vietnamese girl, a nail shop owner, or even an obese Angolan middle-aged woman running a pedicure operation with pink walls... yes, no form of hueman life is beneath me at such moments. I’ve even had dreams that I was a door or a vase, free to observe - I imagine only the seeing, the satisfaction of curiosity, and not the thousands of cares that must affect these people who I want to inhabit. But most of all then, when to this love of curiosity is added some sudden burst of energy, I start to wonder about men like myself of around my age, and what it would be like to be them, what they think moment to moment, what pulls them this way and that. I feel then a great longing for them and also for myself, and think of friendships that I could have had with them and the great tasks that could await. I feel beset by this as an almost erotic irritation that I will never know who lived in that building at that window, never see what they saw looking out. These ways... this is all my version of ‘love for mankind.’ Of the other abstract kind, it means nothing and those who invoke it are bullshitters.”

He feels like he is going to die soon.

Containing all these Spirits within him. He discovers the Ideal. Out of his Particularity, something Universal. If he can express it then his life has been one worth dying for.

The lonely man declares:

* “Where to recover true friendship then? In this case though, more than in others, how could they stop you, if you only learned to listen to instinct and follow the pleasure of desires? There’s nothing in principle that the state can do to stop you, if you should give yourself over to real friendship.”

This is the rational kernel. The pearl of wisdom. Everything else—the vitalism, the wolves, the eugenic fantasies—is noise designed to protect this core.

On white sand beach, the horizon a copulation of blues; the firmament and the wine-colored sea. The sun having ridden past the zenith observes the spectacle. Dressed elegant, pale, feverish he sits and stares. Stares at the athletic young men holding knives performing pyrrhic dance round a good fire. Hella Good by No Doubt blasting from boombox. Arms interlocking, butt-kickers, spinning, stabbing. Round and round. Their steps in beat with electronic syncopation. No shirts, no shoes, no problems. The light dances with them reflected on their glistening anointed bodies. The red satin kerchiefs crowning heads and around necks. Sipping on his ice tea the man admires the results. “Glory be! Glory be!! Ave! AVE! IO! We salute all the gods in their abodes high and low and in the seas. All is good. All is good. All is great. Be forever you gorgeous beasts of prey! ALLAHU AKBAR!!!” The feverish man intones. Visualizing the praise like perfumed smoke rising up out of his skull, joining the fragrance of all creation.

Ask him about his casting choices. It’s really very simple. In short: JCVD hits in a way that Billy Blanks doesn’t and he refuses to be forced to say otherwise.

Transfixed on the tv screen displaying Jean-Claude Van Damme in all his elegant ferocity, kicking the daylight from the savage eyes of Asiatic barbarians, absolutely destroying his opponent without ambivalence—flawlessly in the final round— he could watch this for hours. Reasoning in retrospect that the barbarian on the receiving end of the Belgian’s fury could not help but misuse his own talents and power, exemplifying the cruelty of the oriental matrix their genius had be shaped—or rather warped by— the warrior degenerating into a mere criminal.

Thus Providence has brought JCVD into existence so as to remind the despot that they too are prey liable to get caught in the gaze and ground up in the limbs and skillful technique of another. The blood-drunk audience chants “Nok Su Kao! Nok Su Kao! Nok Su Kao!” One suppresses the bubbling sympathy as the native fighter grimacing groggily slaps his thighs in consternation at this latest betrayal, the kind of self-consciousness required to cope with his own people turning against him lies beyond his horizon, barring an unlikely retreat into Buddhist monasticism and self-reflection/dissolution. Still, is it so bad? This humiliation? This coming so very close to death?

Grim reminder -”

Recall the moment before and after in which Doom-Driven Achilles sees one of Priam’s sons, Lycaon emerging out of the river,

“By heaven, an awesome miracle right before my eyes! These gallant, die-hard Trojans, even those I’ve killed, they’ll all come rising back from the western gloom! Look at this fellow here, back he comes again, fleeing his fatal day - and I’d sold him off as a slave in holy Lemnos but the heaving gray salt sea can’t hold him back, though it stops whole fleets of men who buck its tides. Let’s try again - this time he’ll taste my spearpoint. Now we’ll see, once and for all we’ll know if he returns as fast from his newest destination - or the firm life-giving earth can hold him down, the grave that hugs the strongest man alive.”

This is not mockery. Achilles’ in his enmity and consternation nonetheless offers praise, though there is a sardonic tinge to his question over whether or not the earth would be able to hold Lycaon and whether he would be able to escape the Hall of Hades… This World inhabited by Men such as Achilles has born witness to queerer phenomena. Why should a revenant and a vengeful spirit be out of the question, in fact, ritual mutilation and dismemberment of the adversaries corpse is done *precisely* to avoid this very real possibility. If the man had managed to heroically traverse the heaving seas, what makes you think he won’t come back?

Let us note here the fear of the vengeful ghost, whose vengeance went unexpressed in life, through corporeal action. This is a very real force. There is Power in the Blood.

Lycaon though in his love of life dodges Achilles’ blow and hugs his knees, begging for his life. The moment that follows this is one that still sends shivers through my body. Achilles coldly rebukes him and in so doing “break character”, provides in his cruelty a consolation, and transmits the Wisdom of their Cruel and Heroic Era.

“Fool, don’t talk to me of ransom. No more speeches. Before Patroclus met his day of destiny, true, it warmed my heart a bit to spare some Trojans; droves I took alive and auctioned off as slaves. But now not a single Trojan flees his death, not one the gods hand over to me before your gates, none of all the Trojans, sons of Priam least of all! Come, friend, you too must die. Why moan about it so? Even Patroclus died, a far, far better man than you. And look, you see how handsome and powerful I am? The son of a great man, the mother who gave me life a deathless goddess. But even for me, I tell you, death and the strong force of fate are waiting.

There will come a dawn or sunset or high noon when a man will take my life in battle too - flinging a spear perhaps or whipping a deadly arrow off his bow.”

At that Lycaon’s knees gave way on the spot, his heart too. He let go of the spear, he sank back down … spreading both arms wide.

Following this Achilles tossed Lycaon’s corpse into the river, drawing the complaint of said river’s deity, which escalated into a fight between them which revealed Achilles’ earlier statements about the slain men of Troy rising from the western gloom, prophetic. As the river god expelled the corpses of the men (denying Achilles’ spiteful attempts to deny them the proper funerary rites, Fate has once more saved Achilles’ Honor from his infamous tendency to seethe) and proceeded to throttle Achilles’ shit.

The river god’s throttling of brave Achilles is so thorough that the Hero finds himself desperately gasping for air, crying out to the greater gods for salvation. The roles have been reversed,

“Father Zeus! To think in all my misery not one god can bring himself to rescue me from this river! Then I’d face any fate. And no god on high, none is to blame so much as my dear mother - how she lied, she beguiled me, she promised me I’d die beneath the walls of the armored Trojans, cut down in blood by Apollo’s whipping arrows!

I wish Hector had killed me!

The best man bred in Troy - the killer a hero than and a hero too the man whose corpse he stripped! Now look what a wretched death I’m doomed to suffer, trapped in this monstrous river like some boy, some pig-boy swept away, trying to ford a winter torrent in a storm!”

The greater gods Hephaestus and Hera intervened on his behalf. To make sure the Epic didn’t end in such a farcical manner. Immediately following this intervention the gods found themselves having to intervene again in order to insure that Achilles didn’t single-handedly sack Troy. Hinting at his own potential to overcome Fate.

Hector had outrun fleet-footed Achilles. A lesser man wouldn’t have made it a quarter into the first lap around the city walls. That Athena should intervene resorting to mischief in order to stall him, that the trick should be noticed but the insight (the reminder) should help him remember himself, and in doing so turn and face his doom. Athena’s Cunning proved a mercy. That Hector should be mourned by all, that the gods should unite to preserve his body and have it delivered back home to receive the appropriate funeral rites, and that to this day we remember him and find ourselves moved.

The betrayal is in not dying. They cannot help but admire and glory in the deconstruction, despite it being at their own countryman’s expense, this champion in whose presence they had once cowered, misrecognizing the brute as a god and a king. Their bloodlust has opened the way for further ennoblement. According to him, to our Bronze Age Pervert, this is something deeply Platonic. Just read Book 3 of Plato’s *Republic.* Socrates (as portrayed here by Seth Rogan) would’ve adored JCVD.

The image of JCVD. Pre-philosophical. Pre-political. The raw agonal drive Pindar celebrated.

And perhaps it’s true that all art made in service of political ends is pornographic.

Philosophy, per Alamariu’s dissertation, is sublimated perversity. The perversion of an agonaphilic society. Socrates redirects the contest from physical domination to logical domination. But the drive remains. The pleasure of refuting your opponent, of making them admit contradiction, of dominating them dialectically—this is the same drive, just sublimated.

BAP recognizes this and refuses the sublimation. Bronze Age Mindset is consciously pornographic—not in the literal sense but in the structural sense.

**Pornography** = The representation of sex that reduces sex to its mechanical operation stripped of love, intimacy, relationship. Sex as pure technique, as domination/submission, as spectacle for consumption.

**Political art** = The representation of politics that reduces politics to its mechanical operation stripped of virtue, justice, the common good. Politics as pure technique (management), as domination/submission (agonistics), as spectacle for consumption (the election as season finale).

The wolves, the zoo animals, the eugenic fantasies—all of it functions as political pornography pushed to maximum intensity to reveal that politics as such is pornographic.

This is why reasoned arguments don’t work. You can’t argue someone out of their pleasure in domination/submission. You can’t rationally persuade the crowd to stop chanting “Nok Su Kao!” You are chanting Nok Su Kao. The aesthetic-erotic appeal precedes and overwhelms rational deliberation. The image of JCVD in victory—beautiful because it dominates, because it humiliates, because it appeals to the pre-rational pleasure we take in hierarchy and submission.

Wilhelm Reich posited that we live in a structurally neurotic society. Neurosis is caused by sexual stasis. The Master-Slave dialectic is unconsciously eroticized. Modern man is characterized by tension, anxiety-neuroticism, perversion, and pathological tolerance. The character structure of modern man “is typified by characterological armoring against his inner nature and against the social misery which surrounds him.”

Reich believed this could be cured. Sexual liberation + socialist revolution = emancipation from neurosis. Neurosis is not biological fate. Change the material conditions, change the libidinal structure. History is the history of sexual repression—and sexual repression can be overcome.

BAP’s project, insofar as it agrees with Wilhelm Reich’s psychosexual theorization of Fascism, diverges on the crucial point: the sadomasochistic core can’t be cured.

Here he follows William Burroughs rather than Reich.

Burroughs: The Ugly Spirit is implanted through systems of control—specifically through the formalization of time (calendrical systems operated by priestly castes) and the mathematization of language. The human nervous system is plastic but not protean. There are only so many variations. Control systems are *perennial* despite linguistic and civilizational particularities.

Systems of Control are characterized by the mathematization and manipulation of language and the production of afterlives (both underworld and dream) concomitant with the formalization of time. The development of advanced calendrical systems is difficult to disentangle from advances in agriculture, animal husbandry, eugenics, and the development of large human settlements. The available archeological evidence pointing towards rather drastic increases in ritualistic human sacrifice that accompany such advances. We can also observe such societies ossifying into a caste system. One that’s organized in a ternary manner: the priests, the warriors, and the working commoners.

The priest caste comes to be defined by their monopoly over these processes and productions. The formalization of time entails its bifurcation—one eternal-sacral and the other temporal-profane—which is seemingly related to the settling down of humans into agrarian societies and the development of cities centered around temple-complexes inherited and operated by a priestly caste.

An accurate calendar was essential to the foundation and maintenance of the priest’s power. The priests could calculate into the future or the past exactly what the populace would be doing, hearing, seeing on a given date. This alone would have enabled them to predict the future or reconstruct the past with considerable accuracy since they could determine what conditioning would be or had been applied on any given date to a hermetically sealed population.

The performance of the festivals and the correct sacrificial rites are mandated for the preservation of world, the city, and the self. The Self emerges from this interplay of the person, the person’s practical activities (a familial inheritance), and the preservation of this sacral temporality and cosmos as calculated by the priestly authorities. The “Self” might then be understood as something received, or implanted, having been prefabricated by the calendrical system—the person is told who they fundamentally are, their rhythms determined and predictable.

The Longhouse operates on the same principle**.** It is a system of control defined by collective vigilance and the formalization of social time. The calendar becomes the algorithm. The festival becomes the discourse cycle. The priest becomes the moderator, the influencer, the platform itself.

In the Longhouse, the sacramental calendar is replaced by the content schedule, the product launch, the discourse event. Everyone knows what everyone else will be doing, saying, consuming on a given date because the algorithm has determined the conditioning. The person is told who they fundamentally are through engagement metrics, through the performance of correct opinions at correct times, through the ritualized display of solidarity and the equally ritualized excommunication of heretics.

The Longhouse is constant surveillance. Collective vigilance. You’re fine if you’re charming and beloved or worthy of pity or a very good performer with a strong intuitive sense of who you should be performing to in order to secure your place and either soften or redirect the gaze of others. The nail that sticks out gets hammered.

Punishment in the Longhouse doesn’t teach virtue—it teaches you how to avoid punishment. You learn to read the algorithm, to anticipate the discourse, to perform the rituals that signal membership. The Longhouse is also a Mother of Monstrosities which churns out Epsteins and Weinsteins—those who master the performance so thoroughly they can violate its stated principles while maintaining the appearance of compliance.

To break out of these patterns, Burroughs said, “we’d have to effectively move beyond the human.”

Burroughs was a pessimist vis-à-vis the human species and condition. At best the human is a transitional phase. Social and technological progress doesn’t emancipate—it *intensifies* control. His aesthetic-magical experimentation aimed explicitly at a post-human condition, dissolving the fixed human definition altogether.

BAP operates on the same wavelength.

The concept of hierarchy remains a given. Hierarchy is a matter of biological entities infected by language, cohabitating. Superiority and inferiority come down to zones of compulsory vigilance, to the canalization of energies through breeding and education into received trades and tasks.

Hierarchy is given insofar as it is a matter of *form*. Forms might change but Form itself remains. The recognizable form of the human from top to top to bottom: head, shoulders, knees, toes. The particularities are accidental—contingent on habit and custom. What is *necessary*, what makes the Human human, is this form. Whether it emerged via natural processes or descended into elemental matter molded in conformity with ideal proportions—society as hierarchical arrangement is compelled by this essence.

Like the web-weaving spider and its web. An innate template. Certain patterns are universal. The exceptions prove the rule.

Writing in Bronze Age Mindset: “There is an inherent ‘intelligence’ inside things, uncanny, silent and demonic. Its workings and aims are obscure to us.”

This is why Reich’s cure fails. You can’t cure hierarchy through sexual liberation because hierarchy isn’t just repressive conditioning—it’s structural to the organism. The brain at the top commanding the body below. The vertical organization of the human form **is** the template for social hierarchy. Any attempt to eliminate it fights the structure of the organism itself.

And any attempt to perfect it (Fascism, eugenics, technocratic optimization) intensifies the control system. The calendrical priesthood becomes the managerial state. Time-formalization (sacred/profane) becomes work-schedule optimization (productivity metrics, algorithmic management). The Longhouse becomes the temple and the castle and the cathedral and the nation-state**.** The Ugly Spirit persists, only now it’s *installed* through different technologies.

In keeping with the Conservative-Organic cyclical perspective of civilizations and history posited by thinkers like Oswald Spengler, social and technological advancements (i.e., “progress”) do not in themselves emancipate us from these systems of control—the opposite if anything appears to be the case.

Advanced Industrial Society having led to the collective atomization of peoples, ultimately depending upon the Sovereign as both alien object and universal referent, in effect being estranged from their own sovereignty. An apparent unity of opposites, of atomization and dependency. Associative bodies are sublated into the existing corporatist scheme being transformed into interest-groups and political constituency, as the individual in turn becomes deprived of self-reliance. Man as economic unit, the human resource, is left to inhabit a worldless world. One that is suspended in the eternal decadence of the present.

Atomization and dependency fuse completely. You are alone together. Monitored constantly. Your performance evaluated in real-time. The Self prefabricated by the platform, the discourse, the algorithm. You exist to be perceived, to be legible to the collective gaze, to perform the rituals that maintain your standing.

BAP’s post-human fantasy—four thousand wolves rampaging, nature reclaiming the ruins, the end of the Anthropocene—isn’t Romantic primitivism. It’s a *strong* pessimism: the only way out is the elimination of the human form itself. True justice requires human extinction because the human *is* the control system. The Longhouse *is* us.

The passage on Empedocles reveals everything:

* There was Empedocles, a philosopher, man of high vision. He jumped into volcano Aetna in Sicily because he knew he would be reborn as a god. Now imagine yourself in front of rim of Aetna. It’s dry and sandy. You feel the heat but is not like you thought it might be. Is not Romantic. Is just hot, dry, you can’t breathe, and the smell of infernal sulfur and wet earth and even worse things triggers an old memory or instinct in you to run. You’re brought to face with a vehemence and brutality of rock and you start to feel dizzy staring in. Molten rock in your nostrils and it’s not just that it scares you. If it were great fear, that could be a spur to action. But it fills your nostrils with banality and dullness of plain molten dust, you see gray and black. It reminds you of torrid summer afternoon by abandoned gas station, you are stranded on dirt road, choked by heat and so much dust. You see flames in the hole but it lacks the romance of fire as you imagined it. Is this it? It seems like nothing to you, because to your eye it’s nothing. So you pull away from it. You’re not reborn as a god, you remain a mule. Your lying mind now comes up with many thoughts about why it’s right to pull back. Why, of course! There’s a nice meal to have, a glass of wine. Maybe there’s a girl waiting. Her pussy is warm and inviting. Empedocles was deluded.

Orpheus turned.

That’s you. Young man. You are NOT Japanese. This is BAP describing himself. And thank God he failed in this stunt. That’s us. We can’t even properly sacrifice ourselves anymore. The romantic gesture becomes gray and banal when confronted. The volcano’s heat strips away enchantment, reveals the act in its material poverty. We pull back to the warm pussy and the glass of wine because we are post-historical subjects incapable of the leap that would rupture our condition.

So what remains? Aesthetic withdrawal. Perform the monstrosity to reveal the monstrosity. Make the Ugly Spirit visible by embodying it maximally. Accept that politics is pornographic, that hierarchy is given, that the Longhouse is structural, that the sadomasochistic core can’t be cured.

*Interlude: The Conversion of Callicles*

Ascended Reply-Guy/Orbiter Callicles who ranted at Socrates about the greatness of tyranny and the need for philosophers to act upon the world rather than simply interpret it and the Will to Power and about how millions must die. Socrates’ response, “keep talking like that and your dick will eventually shrink down into a clitoris. Intemperate slut.” Having passed through the barriers of shame Socrates’ had conjured up successfully against Callicles’ companions. The young man proved himself more than capable of holding his own against the Wise Satyr. His mind whetted by the polishing stone of Consensus-Nomos rather than broken against it.

What Callicles’ is in fact doing is eulogizing people like Alcibiades, serenading them through political discourse, attracted to the Heroic and anxious about its potential loss at the barbarous hands of an Asiatic Consensus. The anxiety producing in him a Call-to-Arms. Reacting he embraces the Political. The precocious youth rhapsodizes about what is attractive and the need to conserve it in the manner of the overly-enthused 19 year old girl. Naïve arousal. Legs kicked up in the air. Blushing as he imagines hugging Achilles’ knees, imagines Achilles’ trampling his chest, imagines Achilles’ weeping over his corpse. Callicles’ is a zealous fan and prolific author of fanfiction. All this talk about superior men and their right to rule and how unfair it is for the inferior to reign over the superior by banding together and inventing laws. He would wrangle and dominate the very thing that gave Birth to the Hero. He wishes to facilitate and stream-line the breeding of his idealized lover, presiding over their education. Seeking to control the Polis and make it into a Brood-Mare for the Men he Fantasizes of. He knows that one day he will be old and ugly, grotesque in his drooling lasciviousness, beings such as him are cursed with long life. That what is pathetic, what is pitiful, what is villainous about them can and will become obvious with Time. Once the valiant youth gives way to the ornery senior.

Desiring the Attractive-Superior he reveals himself Unattractive-Inferior. A Servant of the Hero. The Hero is after all deified within the Poets’ World. The Hero’s Morality is the Poet’s Morality and Poetry is Popular. The Hero’s Morality is Popular Morality congealed into and made intelligible through the Exemplar Individuals that populate these narratives. They Dwell in the Virtual*.*

Callicles’ shame is the profoundest of them all, his self-hatred immense, he confuses what he desires with what he is in-himself. As one cursed with the Pervert’s Clairvoyance, Callicles sees a vague impression of who he is, of he will become, and he is horrified. It is a nightmare. Cassandra screams. He desires pleasure and he seeks it out whenever and wherever he can. He desires the pleasure of recognition. In a word; he is addicted to the dopamine-rush of social media likes. He denies this of course, but what he denies, in its capacity as the inverted-reflection of what he desires, is precisely what he is. His phantasmic excesses congealed in a Grotesque Symbolic Form. What neither he nor Socrates seem to acknowledge in their debate is that Callicles’ political ideology and its proposed program, actually reveals the reality undergirding the Polity. He does this by seeing its magnified reflection in the Heroic-Poetic Past and affirming the necessity of it in order to meet the Present Political and Cultural Crisis. “What do you mean Master’s shouldn’t have Absolute Power over their Property? Are you crazy!?”… The Grotesqueness of the Society dependent on Slave-Labor and that of Callicles’ as an aspiring Tyrant, despite positioning himself as part of an Exceptional Few against the Consensus, he is in fact articulating the Truth of the Consensus itself. Naturally. Somewhere deep inside him he realizes that he must escape this, that he is unfree, he lacks the language to articulate his unfreedom. If this is his fate, my God. He lashes out against the Society that Birthed him. Speaks of his Right to Rule over it. Doom-driven he saunters haughtily to the Sacrificial Altar of Politics. If it was not for the Daimonic-Intervention that drew him to Socrates. To challenge Socrates who embodied his Doubts. Trained as Gorgias’ Vengeance, Callicles prepared to petrify the Apostate Satyr, who betrays Nature in favor of Consensus, with his critical gaze. Walking over the collapsed Idol on his way to Glory.

Callicles is no Alcibiades. One might intuit that Callicles had perhaps been a sickly and clumsy child. Incredibly sensitive. Quick to insult. Quick to descend into bouts of sulking withdrawal. Given to flights of imagination propelling him into detailed erotic landscapes. A Lover of ghosts and daemons. Eventually coming into fitness. He wouldn’t have made it otherwise. Callicles is chastened by Socrates for his *immoderation.* He was neither chaste nor frustrated in his pleasures when he’d had his fated confrontation with Socrates. He was frustrated-in-pleasure, in brazen youth.

The difference between Alcibiades and Callicles is that Alcibiades could not be convinced. Socrates’ rebuffing him proved the error that would define their shared doom. Eros could not be reconciled or consoled. Callicles on the other hand was perhaps too intelligent. His intellect would always keep him from the brilliance of an Alcibiades. After all he was seeking a career in politics and was the star pupil of the Sophists. His convictions could not be cowed by appeals to public decency. An admirable trait no doubt. His conversion was the germination of a seed that was already within him. Too smart to die heroically. To die a martyr. To die for the one he loves. Though he could live and write. Fated to die in his sleep. Deep down inside he knew this.

Socrates’ saw right through the little pervert and put him in his place. The Heat of the Pervert’s Gaze turned inward. The molten material shaping into the figure of the Lion-Headed Hegemonikon enthroned within the chest cavity. The audacious young twink having learned the errors of his ways grew up to become Plato.

*Interlude: Power in the Blood!*

There is Power in the Blood. Why do I repeat this? This fear we have concerning the vengeful ghosts. Contemporary psychobabbling with its sterile clinical language will attempt to seal away these shades under a fashionable diagnosis. This is a proven failure. We remain Haunted. The Specter looms.

What is Nemesis? Why is Blood so powerful? Blood congeals and in its congealing it concretizes. Blood is the adhesive of all God-Complexes, of all Fetishes, whether in its coarse form or projected as a subtle vapor. As mortals the gods are born in a river of blood. What is Nemesis if not the form given, of the Blood that has sunken into the Earth, into the Elements. Given an Elemental-Body. The Blood has a Voice. A thunderous roar, a Testimony, echoing through the Firmament and through the Abyss and everything in between. With such force that the World itself is reshaped and the mighty are cowed and the proud are cast-down, are flattened.

This is True. Sophia in her aspect as Nemesis. I want you to imagine; the sanguine and fiery ghosts melting, synthesizing, and congealing minerals to form six powerful mecha-deities. Each one taking the totemic shape of supposedly extinct megafauna. I want you to envision them fusing into a single Human-form. This is the *Anthropos* or The Worker*.* Piloted by the honorable Joseph Stalin, Che Guevara, Mao Zedong, Muammar Gaddafi, Kim Il Sung, and the roguish fan favorite Ayatollah Khomeini.

“And the Lord said, ‘What have you done? Listen; your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.” - Genesis 4:10

Im a 23 y.o. (M) college student. I attend my classes online and I am mostly home (this is relevant). 

I live with my grandma (75 F) and her son (53 M), the house is pretty close to my parents’ house. I have been living with grandma for 8 years now because my parents’ house is in a pretty bad state, we don’t even have a working shower. So grandma invited me to come live with her. 

My grandma and I are pretty close, always have been. She’s always taken care of me, she has always been bosting about my great grades to everyone. We went on daily walks, grocery shopping, I would go with her to her doctor’s appointments etc.  She is a loving person who would do anything to make anyone happy. And she did always put everyone else first instead of herself. 

On December 15, 2025, she started feeling unwell. In the meantime, one of her best friends passed. I didn’t want to tell her about that right away because she wasnt feeling well, but her son told her and she started feeling even worse. Just looking at her face you could see that she had a stroke. She all textbook symtoms, but my Dad and my uncle were totaly unbotered by it. I was begging them to get her to the Hospital, but my Dad said “We will, let’s just see if she gets better”. My mom was also on my side, so were my other uncle and aunt so we managed to get them to call the ambulance. I had to take benzos (i have anxiety and POTS) to calm down from all that stress. 

She went to the hospital and stayed there for 6 days. Over those 6 days, only my Dad, me and my mom were visiting her. Her son who lived with us didn’t bother to even go there once. 

When she came back home, she was disoriented in space and time but she could walk. She also forgot about the house (She kept telling us that wasnt her house). My uncle was already pissed because she had forgotten some things. He kept screaming at her every time she would say something wrong/out of place. 
I had told him multiple times that he had to go easier with her, that she needed time to recover. But he kept yelling. Every time she would want to go back to her old routine (making coffee in the morning, cooking, making the bed…) he would scream at her to leave it to him. Okay, he “wanted to help” but she knows how to do said things and she should be encouraged to slowly get back to her old way of living. 

Over the next few days his behavior remained the same despite me basically screaming at him not to yell at her (I had told him quietly multiple times too). But he wouldnt listen. She doesn’t let her outside and locks most rooms so she won’t go through his stuff. She feels like shes in prison. She’s not type of person who would spend the entire day in front of TV, she loved doing chores. 

My Dad started coming over all the time to hang with my uncle but set up a table in the hallway and they spend the entire day there while grandma is supposed to only sit in her room. This is completely unusual because my uncle used to always spend hours with my grandma in the living room, they would watch TV, eat, talk etc (he is unemployed, disabled - doesnt have his right arm). But since she has gotten sick he doesn’t want to spend even a minute with her. He spends the entire day in the halway, he even eats there. 

I love spending time with my grandma and talking to her but I am not able to do it all day since I have multiple 90-min classes in a day, plus homework and studying for the upcoming finals (8 exams). I kept spending hours with her so I have fallen behind with getting my schoolwork done. I was happy to help, but what pissed me off was my uncle DEMANDING i stay with her all time while he sits in the halway DRINKING with my Dad all day every day (basically from 7 am to 10 pm). I was making a presentation for my class and my Dad called me to take care of grandma because he was busy DRINKING. 

I confronted them about that and they thought i was joking so they smiled at my face. I was so furious. 

Today was the same. They kept sitting and drinking in the halway while I was sitting with my grandma. They had the nerve to tell my I AM NOT DOING ENOUGH for my grandma. My Dad came to the living room drunk and started singing loudly. I couldnt take it anymore so I started screaming at him. I told him was so stupid, that he always acted smart but in reality he didn’t know s*it, that he was shallow and incosiderate. I told them that they should be ashamed and then I told them to go f themselves. I also loudly sh*ttalked our drunk neighbour who had the nerve to come here to drink while the sick woman is there. He heard everything but he kept sitting. I went outside and threw his shoes out on the street. Minutes later I felt bad about that, they were the ones who invited him. I shouldnt have done that. 

I don’t know what happened, I guess all stress from the past 30 days had accumulated and i just couldnt take it anymore. This was so unusual for me since I am a pretty quiet, introverted guy who never stands for himself. 
I was basically shaking so my mom had to get me my meds. Now I feel so bad about everything but still can’t believe they can be so selfish.",3,1768852597.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False
1qhessc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1qhessc/11w6d_light_spotting_cramping/,11w6d light spotting & cramping,"Ill start this off by saying I do plan on going into the ER if my symptoms last throughout the remainder of the day, but I wanted to ask for some advice first as I don’t have an OB I can call until after my first appointment on the 27th of this month and I cannot take my pregnancy concerns to the Veterans Affairs Hospital because they don’t deal in pregnancy and will simply tell me to go to city.

Should I be overly concerned? I experienced some light spotting this morning around 9am and its now 3pm (coffee stain like pinkish red spotting with only a chia seed sized clot) and have since experienced light cramping that gets better when I am laying down on my side. I have yet to have any other cramping or bleeding up until now, but I did see that a loss of morning sickness could be a symptom of a miscarriage and I have not experienced it since the end of week 9.

I worry about going to the ER as well because I have extremely bad trauma from my past and being in those settings makes my anxiety skyrocket and I worry that I could make my symptoms worse by being there and the average wait time in my area is more than 8-10 hours and we are experiencing a boom in flu and covid cases. I wear my masks in these settings, but I know they are not foolproof and I worry about causing myself more problems for something that could be normal and will pass with time.

I am also not currently experiencing any UTI symptoms, no fever, nausea, shakes or weakness. Just light cramping as if I was on my first day of my period.",1,1768852555.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

It's a sort of creamy brown with a very, very subtle green undertone in certain light. The green is more noticeable when swatched, but when writing, it comes across as a perfect coffee color.

1qhelzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1qhelzg/what_helped_me_stop_spiralling_as_a_new_dad/,What helped me stop spiralling as a new dad,"Been a dad now for just over 2 years and what a mental rollercoaster its been. Constant worry over financials, no energy, felt like id completely lost myself and was just existing day to day. I'd catch myself spiralling where one negative thought would trigger another and id end up in a proper dark place. Being a bit of an introvert meant therapy didnt really appeal to me and i wasnt keen on going down the prescription route either, so i started looking into ways to sort my head out myself. Few things genuinely helped me turn it around, wanted to share in case it helps someone else going through the same :)

**1. Label negative thoughts instead of believing them**  
When you catch yourself thinking ""im failing"" or ""i cant do this,"" give that thought a name like ""the failure loop"" or ""the cant cope spiral."" Then acknowledge it (""theres the failure loop again"") and let it pass. Creates distance between you and the thought instead of getting sucked into the spiral. Sounds simple but it genuinely works.

**2. Calm your body first**  
When youre stressed your nervous system is in fight or flight mode and your mind cant settle. Use breathing to reset it fast - physiological sigh works in 30 seconds (in through nose, top up breath, long exhale out). Calms everything down and stops the physical stress response so you can actually think clearly.

**3. Recharge without guilt**  
Taking 10 minutes for yourself isnt selfish, its necessary. Get outside, walk around the block, sit in the car with a coffee, anything that gives you a break. Burnt out dads running on empty cant help anyone. Your family needs you present, not just physically there but mentally checked out.

I still have off days but theyre nowhere near as frequent or intense as they used to be, and i actually feel like myself again instead of just going through the motions.

1qhel2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1qhel2u/yes_im_asking_that_question_am_i_trans/,Yes I’m asking that question: Am I Trans?,"I know this question is asked a million times but I’m just coming to places where I think I can find true advice.

Some backstory: Grew up on the southside of Chicago with a religious family and all brothers, father is a minister. So naturally I repressed my sexuality and put on the masculine front. I’ve been into crossdressing since I was a teenager. I actually have a very feminine figure as well, an unusually big but for a male and I have gynecomastia so I’ve had large breast since grade school.

Now I’m 30 and I’m constantly fantasizing about being this petite woman, looking at female clothes daily, dreaming of coffee dates with girl friends and living somewhere far from the reality I’ve known. It reads like a fantasy and in my head sounds like one. I’ve been rather unhappy for awhile and at times I think I’m online seeing post and stories of transitioning and it saving someone’s life I’ve started to believe it’s my problem solver. My fear is that I’ve repressed my sexuality so long it’s widened into this place of confusion where fantasy and fetish live alone without truth. 

I know my mental health is poor right now. I have generalized anxiety, paranoia, and PTSD from childhood. Currently in therapy but even there I find it hard to dwell into this portion of my life.

I’m obviously very masc presenting, beard, masculine clothes, and zero expression of femininity besides my hygiene habits and skincare but I believe that’s just being a hygienic human which somehow society has confused with femininity. I do often crossdress when I can and not just ‘sexy stuff’. I have dresses and heels some leisure wear. I feel comfortable in it and want to go further with makeup and even shaving my beard but never have. 

Overall my main question is those who are trans and happy did you feel that you just had to jump off the deep end and commit or was it very obvious you were not in the right body? Forgive me if anything is insensitive I try to be mindful of those things but online is my sole exposure to the LGBT community and it’s not the greatest place to learn proper etiquette. 

 

Again I know this is asked a million times but I’m desperate for advice and also using this as step 1, admitting my thoughts whether anonymous or not I’ve never expressed part of me.",4,1768852095.0,asktransgender,3,1.0,False

It’s the creeping chronic blah most people accept as “normal.” But after watching Dr. Mark Hyman on The Mel Robbins Podcast, something clicked. This guy broke down how most of us are quietly inflamed, nutrient-starved, and hormonally wrecked without realizing it.



This post is for anyone who’s ""doing everything right"" but still wakes up feeling like garbage. It’s not just you, the system we live in is optimized for convenience, not wellness. Dr. Hyman’s advice is based on decades of medical research and clinical practice, not TikTok pseudo-gurus pushing detox teas.



Here’s what blew my mind and what might actually fix what's draining your energy, focus, mood, and metabolism. All backed by solid science, not vibes.



Ultra-processed food is killing your brain and body

Dr. Hyman calls the Western diet “industrial food-like substances.” 60% of the average American diet is made up of ultra-processed foods, which have been linked to everything from brain fog to depression to obesity.

A study published in The BMJ (2019) found a 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption is associated with a 14% higher risk of all-cause mortality.

Solution? Follow the 10-day reset: remove all processed foods, added sugars, and refined carbs. Replace them with whole foods like vegetables, healthy fats, quality animal protein, and low-glycemic fruits. Most people notice better energy and digestion in a few days.



Your blood sugar yo-yos are wrecking your mood

Constant spikes from sugar and simple carbs lead to crashes that look like anxiety, fatigue, or even ADHD.

According to Dr. Robert Lustig (author of Metabolical) and research from the Harvard School of Public Health, stable blood sugar is key to mental clarity and emotional regulation.

Tip from Hyman: Start your day with protein and fiber like eggs, avocado, or a chia pudding with nuts. Skip the cereal and orange juice. If you grab a muffin and coffee first thing, you're sabotaging your mental state before 9AM.



 Chronic inflammation is the real silent killer

 Hyman refers to this as “inflammaging”: slow, smoldering inflammation that causes everything from joint pain to brain fog to autoimmune issues.

 A major review by Dr. Philip Calder in Nature Reviews Immunology (2020) linked chronic low-grade inflammation to heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes.

 Anti-inflammatory upgrades: add turmeric, wild fatty fish, leafy greens, and olive oil. Remove seed oils, sugar, and processed meats. Even tiny swaps matter.



Most people are nutrient-deficient without knowing it

Up to 92% of Americans are deficient in at least one vitamin or mineral, especially magnesium, omega-3s, vitamin D, and B12. These are essential for energy, cognition, and hormone balance.

In his book The Pegan Diet, Hyman explains how even a “healthy” diet today might not cut it due to soil depletion and poor food quality.

His “nutrient repletion” protocol includes a high-quality multivitamin, omega-3s, magnesium glycinate, and vitamin D3 with K2. It’s not about supplements replacing food, but bridging the gap.



Gut health controls your brain more than you think

The vagus nerve, your gut-brain superhighway, sends more messages from your gut to your brain than the other way around.

According to the American Gut Project and researchers like Dr. Emeran Mayer (author of The Mind-Gut Connection), gut health is directly linked to anxiety, depression, and fatigue.

Hyman’s gut reset: eliminate common triggers (gluten, dairy, sugar, alcohol), load up on prebiotic fiber (like garlic, onions, lentils), take a quality probiotic, and tailor it based on symptoms.



 You can't exercise or meditate your way out of a bad metabolism

  We’re told to “just move more and stress less,” but if your mitochondria (your energy factories) are shot from toxins, poor sleep, and crap food, no amount of yoga will help.

  On the podcast, Hyman explains how metabolic flexibility and the ability to burn both fat and glucose for energy is key. Most people are stuck in sugar-burning mode because they snack all day.

  Try time-restricted eating (12-14 hour fasting window), walk after meals, and add healthy fats to meals to shift your metabolism.



 Feeling better is not just possible, it’s shockingly fast

   Hyman’s 10-Day Reset has thousands of before-after testimonials, and it’s not magic. Once you remove what’s harming your body and give it the right fuel, it knows what to do.

   Robbins tested the protocol herself and said her bloating, sugar cravings, and anxiety dropped within a week. Which aligns with research from the Journal of Nutrition, showing that dietary intervention can improve metabolic biomarkers in just 5–10 days.



If something feels off in your body or brain, you're not broken or lazy. You’re being hijacked by a system that profits off your fatigue. The good news? You can opt out and feel radically better  in less than two weeks.



Highly recommend watching or listening to this full episode on The Mel Robbins Podcast if you want to feel like yourself again. Or finally meet the version of you that’s been buried under inflammation, imbalance, and bad advice.",1,1768852051.0,NextGenMan,0,1.0,False

I recently moved to Calgary and I’m looking to connect with the local trading community. I’ve been trading Forex for about a year and would love to find some like-minded people to share experiences and learn alongside.

Trading can be a bit lonely, so I’m hoping to find a healthy group or a few friends to:

• Exchange knowledge and stay motivated.

• Grab coffee or co-work occasionally.

• Support each other’s growth in the markets.

Note - I am not selling anything or looking for paid services. I’m simply looking for genuine local friendships with fellow traders so we can succeed together.

If you’re in Calgary and interested in connecting, please feel free to comment or send me a DM.

1qhejae,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qhejae/burnout_reality_and_trying_not_to_give_up/,"Burnout, Reality, and Trying Not to Give Up","Before I graduated in accounting, I wanted to understand the job in real life, not just textbooks. I didn’t want theory only. Luckily, I found a course that explained how accounting actually works in companies, far away from academic talk. I learned a lot and felt I made a real shift from theory to reality.
I graduated happy, thinking I was finally ready for the job market. But when I entered it, I faced a harsh truth: preference was given to foreigners. Interview after interview, I wasn’t selected. Often, the interviewer was foreign and the job went to someone from their own country. That’s how the market kept moving.
I told myself maybe I needed to work harder. So I did. I pushed myself, upgraded my skills, learned Excel deeply, sacrificed outings, fun, shows, and rest, all for a chance. But after all that, I reached a stage where I wasn’t even getting interviews anymore. Rejections came without a meeting.
Now I’m 30, with no real work experience, after giving my time and energy to accounting, a field I never truly worked in. Sometimes I think, “I wish I had chosen something else,” but even then, the market still feels the same.
The hardest part is my mental state now. I feel empty. Like a car with no fuel. No matter how much I press the pedal, nothing moves. People might think I’m lazy or avoiding effort, but the truth is I’m exhausted inside. Professional certifications feel impossible. Even studying for IELTS feels heavy. I open a page and fall asleep. My mind runs away from effort.
I’m unemployed, drifting through days. Coffee shops, streets, watching people pass by, going home, TV, sleep, repeat. Every time I try to stand up and do something useful, my mind escapes. Sleeping, calling people just to waste time, laughing to avoid thinking.
I wasn’t like this before. Reality didn’t break me at first, but over time, it drained me.
I don’t know exactly what I’m asking for here. Maybe advice. Maybe kindness. Maybe just to be heard. 😔",1,1768851987.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Céleste had pulled them from the bayou that morning, gutted them on the back porch while the dew still hung thick. Now they curled golden in the cast iron, skin crisp enough to crack between your teeth.

""Matthieu. Hands.""

The boy jerked his gaze from the window. Sixteen years old hair the color of turned earth. He dipped his fingers in the wash basin, flicked water at his little sister.

""Cut it out,"" Josephine said. Eight years old. Gap in her front teeth.

""Both of y'all hush now."" Céleste set the platter down. Cornbread. Greens swimming in potlikker, chunks of fatback soft as butter. Henri at the head of the table, his face creased from twenty years of field work. Beau to his right. Thirteen, quiet, the kind of boy who watched everything and said little.

Henri bowed his head. ""Bless us, O Lord—""

Matthieu's eyes drifted back to the window. Dark out there now. But earlier, when he'd been hauling water from the pump, he'd seen something. Someone. A shape between the cotton rows, tall and still.

""—and for these, Thy gifts, which we are about to receive—""

Could've been a scarecrow torn loose. Could've been.

""Amen.""

Forks scraped plates. Josephine hummed something tuneless. The August heat pressed against the walls, made the lamp flames dance crooked. Beau ate. Matthieu picked at his fish, pulled bones out one by one.

""Weather's fixin' to break,"" Henri said. ""Feel it in my teeth.""

""Storm'd be good,"" Céleste said. ""Cotton's been cryin' for it.""

She was already up, stacking plates. Grease congealed yellow on the rims. Josephine carried the cornbread pan. Outside, cicadas screamed themselves hoarse.

Three knocks.

Everyone stopped.

""Expecting someone?"" Céleste's voice went flat.

Henri shook his head. Pushed back from the table. His chair legs scraped. The knocking came again. Same rhythm. Like whoever stood out there had all the time in the world.

""Stay put."" Henri moved to the door, one hand on the frame. Céleste's fingers found the dish rag, twisted it. Matthieu stood.

""Sit down,"" she hissed.

The door opened.

The man on the porch smiled. Thirty, maybe. Clean-shaven. White shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, suspenders, dusty trousers. Handsome in a way that made you look twice. His left hand rested on the doorframe.

His right held an axe.

Not gripped. Just held. Loose. The handle leaned against his shoulder like a walking stick. Single-bit head. One edge sharp enough to catch lamplight. The poll on the back side blunt, dark. Rust or something else.

""Evening."" His voice was smooth. ""Real sorry to disturb your supper.""

Henri didn't move. ""Help you?""

""Wagon threw a wheel 'bout two miles back. Horse is spooked, won't settle. Wondered if I might trouble you for some water, maybe borrow tools if you got 'em?""

Southern accent. Not deep, but there. The kind you couldn't place to a specific parish.

""Where you headed?"" Henri asked.

""Morgan City. Got people there.""

Henri glanced back at Céleste. Her face said *no*. Said it loud. He looked at the man again. At the axe.

""Water pump's around back. Got a wrench set in the barn.""

""Appreciate it."" The man didn't move. ""That catfish I smell?""

""Was.""

""Bet it was fine."" He shifted. The axe shifted with him. ""You know, I'd be mighty grateful for a cup of coffee, if you got any on. Been a long day.""

This was the moment. Henri knew it. Céleste knew it. You don't turn away a man in need. Not in Terrebonne Parish. Not if you want to look your neighbors in the face come Sunday.

""Come on in, then.""

Céleste's jaw went tight. The man stepped over the threshold. Wiped his boots on nothing, there was no mat. Set the axe against the wall by the door.

""Name's Thomas,"" he said. ""Thomas Duval.""

""Henri Leblanc. My wife, Céleste."" He gestured. ""That's Matthieu, Beau, Josephine.""

""Pleasure."" Thomas nodded to each of them. His eyes lingered on Josephine. She stared at the axe.

Céleste poured coffee from the pot on the stove. Black. Strong enough to strip paint. Thomas accepted the cup, sat where Henri pointed, the chair at the table's end, where the lamp threw his shadow long across the floor.

""Fine place you got here,"" Thomas said. He sipped. ""How long you been working this land?""

""Twenty-two years."" Henri sat back down. Matthieu hadn't moved. Stood there with his hand on his chair back like he might need to run.

""Good soil?""

""Was. Cotton blight hit us hard last season. Lost near half the crop.""

""Mm."" Thomas drank. ""Heard about that. Spreadin' all over. They say it's in the seeds.""

""Don't know what it is. Just know we got less money than last year.""

Thomas smiled. ""Hard times.""

""They are.""

Beau watched the man's hands. They were clean. Nails trimmed. No calluses, no scars. Not farmer's hands. Not laborer's hands.

""You got boots on,"" Beau said.

Everyone looked at him.

""Sorry?"" Thomas tilted his head.

""Your boots. They're clean.""

Thomas glanced down. Laughed. ""Guess they are. Caught some luck, rained yesterday, but the road stayed hard.""

It hadn't rained in nine days. The road was dust two inches thick.

Matthieu felt it crawl up his spine.

""Where'd you say you were from?"" Céleste asked.

""Abbeville.""

""We got cousins in Abbeville,"" she said. ""You know Father Broussard?""

""Can't say I do.""

""He's been at St. Mary Magdalen near thirty years.""

""I don't get to mass much."" Thomas drained his cup. ""Work Sundays, mostly.""

""What kind of work?""

""Timber. Crew boss.""

Matthieu cleared his throat. ""What kind of horse you got?""

Thomas turned his head. His eyes didn't blink. Not once.

""Chestnut mare. Sixteen hands. Sweet-tempered, usually. Don't know what spooked her.""

Matthieu had seen the horse while Henri and Thomas talked. Black gelding with a white star on his forehead. Tied to the fence post, calm as Sunday.

""Need to check the animals,"" Matthieu said. ""Papa?""

""Go on.""

He went. Grabbed the kerosene lamp from the sideboard, slipped out the back door. The night air sat on him like a wet towel. He ran for the barn.

The horse was gone.

Matthieu held the lamp high. The fence post stood empty. No rope, no reins. He moved to the barn door, shoved it open. Their mule snorted, shifted in his stall. The two cows lay in the straw, chewing cud. Everything normal.

Except.

Against the hay bales, leaning like it had been waiting.

Another axe.

Same as the one inside. Single-bit. The sharp edge gleaming. The poll dark. Matthieu picked it up. His hands started shaking.

Back in the house, something crashed.

He dropped the axe and ran.

The front room had changed. Doors that had stood open, the one to the bedroom, the one to the back hall, were closed. The lamps burned lower. Orange light instead of yellow. Matthieu stopped in the doorway.

Henri slumped in his chair. Eyes glassy. Half-empty whiskey bottle on the table that hadn't been there before. Thomas poured another measure into Henri's cup.

""Where's the rifle?"" Matthieu asked.

Céleste stood by the stove. Beau and Josephine behind her. Her face pale.

""What rifle?"" Thomas said. He smiled.

The rifle that always hung above the door.

It was gone.

""There was a horse,"" Matthieu said. His voice cracked. ""Black horse. Not chestnut. And there's—in the barn, there's—""

""Found my mare, then?"" Thomas interrupted. ""Told you she was skittish. Probably bolted soon as I came inside.""

""It was a gelding.""

""You sure?""

""I'm sure.""

Thomas set the bottle down. Leaned back. ""Well. Memory's a funny thing. 'Specially in the dark.""

Henri's head lolled. He mumbled something. Céleste grabbed Beau's shoulder.

""Josephine,"" she said, quiet. ""Go get your doll.""

""But Mama—""

""Now.""

The girl ran into the bedroom. Céleste edged toward the back door, pulling Beau with her. Matthieu watched Thomas watch her.

""Where you going?"" Thomas asked.

""Kitchen's a mess. Need to—""

""Sit down.""

Not loud. Not a shout. But the air changed. Got heavier. Josephine came back into the room, doll clutched to her chest. She stopped.

""That wasn't there before,"" she whispered.

The doll. She'd left it on the chair by the hearth. Now it sat on the floor in the corner. Facing the wall.

Céleste made a sound in her throat. Grabbed Josephine, grabbed Beau. Shoved them toward the back door. Turned the handle.

Nothing.

She pulled. Threw her weight against it. The door didn't budge. Not locked. Solid. Like it had been nailed shut from outside. But Matthieu had just come through it.

""Problem?"" Thomas stood. Stretched. Joints popped. ""Y'all been real kind. Hate to do this after such a fine meal.""

He picked up the axe.

Henri's head snapped up. His eyes focused. He saw. Knew. Lurched from the chair, drunk and stumbling. Thomas swung.

The poll caught Henri in the shoulder. Not the blade, the blunt back side. Bone cracked. Sharp. Loud. Henri's collarbone punched through his shirt, white and jagged. He screamed. Dropped to his knees.

Thomas lifted the axe again.

This time he used the blade.

It caught Henri where the neck met the shoulder. Bit deep. Henri's scream cut off. Blood jumped up the wall. Sprayed the ceiling. His body jerked. Thomas yanked the axe free. More blood. Henri fell face-first onto the floorboards.

Céleste screamed. Grabbed the children, shoved them into the kitchen, slammed the door. Matthieu heard furniture scraping. The table. Chairs. The heavy iron stove grinding across floorboards.

Thomas pulled the axe from Henri's neck. Wiped the blade on Henri's shirt. Blood spread across the floor, crept toward the kitchen door.

He looked at the barricaded door. Smiled.

""Mama's got the children locked up tight,"" he said. ""Won't matter.""

He hefted the axe. Started toward the kitchen, dragging the blade behind him. It left a red smear on the pine.

Matthieu couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. His father's blood pooled around his boots. The hallway to the bedrooms gaped dark behind him. His room, the one he shared with Beau, just past the parlor.

Thomas glanced back at him.

""You gonna stand there, boy? Or you gonna run?""

It’s usually used notebooks, scripts, and small apps to perform in-process workloads.

I recently added a feature that lets a graph be served over the network and queried remotely using the same Python query API. I’m mainly looking for feedback on the general idea and whether it would be useful feature. One reason I added this feature was being able to query a small knowledge graph that I have on one machine from another machine remotely (using ngrok tunnel).

Here is an example of how it would work: (pip install cogdb)

    from cog.torque import Graph
    
    # Create a graph
    g = Graph(graph_name=""demo"")
    g.put(""alice"", ""knows"", ""bob"")
    g.put(""bob"", ""knows"", ""charlie"")

    g.serve()
    print(""Running at <http://localhost:8080>"")
    input(""Press Enter to stop..."")

Expose endpoint: ngrok http 8080

Querying it remotely:

    from cog.remote import RemoteGraph
    
    remote = RemoteGraph(""<https://abc123.ngrok.io/demo>"")

I can’t stop thinking about him doing the same thing every time he leaves the house. Even for coffee on a Sunday morning with a friend. I’ve had insecure/jealous exes do the ‘well then send a selfie if that’s where you are’ and I fucking hated it and them for doing it, and I find myself wanting the same thing. I would never ask.

He went on the work trip again this year, he said he’d stay if I asked and I said I couldn’t stand the idea of holding him back. I fucking hated being in a relationship with someone with trust issues, no partner should ever hold you back. I had the worst breakdown ever while he was away, and haven’t really gotten better since.

I’m fucking driving myself crazy and constantly relapsing because I can’t handle how him being out of my sight makes me feel. I know I’m insecure because I’m an alcoholic who has pretty thoroughly trashed their life, but the past 19 days is the longest I’ve gone since it happened. I told myself maybe I’d stop feeling so anxious and terrible when he’s out if I stopped, but it’s not working.

I don’t know what to do. I’m 2k miles away from any other support network other than him, and I don’t have enough savings/have a good enough job to live on my own. He’s honestly perfect other than the one incident, and I only can’t stand the thought of him meeting someone else because I don’t want to lose him. But I’m going to keep pushing him away with how angry I still am.

How do you walk away when it also means giving up on a school program you’re half way through, and they’re helping support you through it? How do I stop being so anxious about losing him, when I’d be homeless without him?",1,1768851480.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False

The air almost as cold as the feeling that ran down my spine.

A moment ago I was fast asleep, but now I sat up peering into the darkness of my bedroom. The only light came from the glow of the temperature read-out on the a/c; 23 degrees Celsius, just how I liked it, and way too warm to cause my breath to condensate.

And then there was the stillness.

I carefully allowed my eyes to fall to my watch on the bedside table. 2AM.

‘The witching hour,’ I thought, and then terrified myself by snorting out aloud. The sound, almost too loud.

What had awoken me?

I was fully alert, like prey, when it senses a predator close by.

I became aware of my breathing in the still darkness, slow, deep; in and then out, in and then out.

‘Idiot’, I scolded myself, trying to capture the whisp of a dream that floated just out of grasp, maybe I’d had a nightmare.

Yes, that must’ve been it, and I drew in a deep breath. Better get back to sleep, I’ve got to be up early for school. First day back after summer break. I fell back down and stared at the ceiling, the fear dissipating as quickly as it came, as my mind became bombarded with what to expect the next day, thinking of the friends I’d not seen in weeks…

And it was in that moment, when I had let down my guard, that it came…

 

The kitchen smelled of bacon, eggs and coffee.

Three people bustled around, Mitch Anderson, still fixing his shirt and straightening his tie, his wife Jane and their six-year old daughter Kailee. Jane Anderson scooped food into the four plates set around the table, and as the last one filled she lifted her head and shouted, ‘Ryan! Get down here now! You’re gonna make everyone late!”

Ten seconds later, ‘Ryan! God dammit!’ And she stormed off heading for the stairs.

Mitch heard his wife knocking on his son’s bedroom door, before shouting a warning that she was coming in.

I'm a long-time lurker/builder, and I finally launched the MVP for my side project, Plandit.

Like many of you, I've been frustrated by how hard it is to find an authentic, non-touristy experience in NYC anymore. Every great spot gets instantly ruined by a viral TikTok video, leading to insane lines and a total vibe shift.

Plandit is my attempt to solve that. It's an itinerary generator that:

1.Fights the Hype: It uses a proprietary ""Anti-Hype"" filter to actively deprioritize places that have gone viral on social media, focusing instead on local favorites and hidden gems.

2.Plans the Whole Day: It doesn't just give you a restaurant list. You tell it how much time you have and what vibe you want, and it generates a full, real-time itinerary (Coffee -> Walk -> Activity -> Dinner -> Drinks).

3.Solves Last-Minute Panic: It prioritizes places with walk-in availability, solving the constant ""I need a last-minute dinner spot"" problem we see in r/FoodNYC.

I've started with a hyper-local focus on Soho, and I'm looking for brutal, honest feedback from this community. Does the concept resonate? What feature is missing?

My wife keeps crossing boundaries, refusing to take accountability and blaming me for overreacting. I feel like shit but don’t know if I am just making a lot of fuss about nothing.

Some of you will recognize a lot of this as I have posted before but used to much personal information and took it down due to getting really spooked by the massive response. So trowaway account this time.

There is new information in this as it all just keeps feeling like a newer ending story.

Some context. I live in a small town where everybody knows each other. Causing a scene by lets say punching someone in the face could create a very uncomfortable situation for my children. Me (m40) and my wife (f37) have two kids (m10) & (f8). 

I used to believed that I had a happy marriage and that me and the wife would grow old together. We have had lots of fun together and have pretty good sex (sometimes great, somtimes meh, normal long term relationship stuff). I absolutely love my wife and think she is the most beautiful woman in the world. When I first got interested in her one of the things I loved about her was that she felt so genuine.

I have often told her that I would appreciate more flirting and initiating from her part. I often tell her how beautiful and sexy she is. She really doesn’t do this towards me and her giving me compliments is very rare. She has since early in our relationship told me that sending flirty messages and giving compliments just isn’t her thing and that is just the way she is. Its not like it never happens, I have all the sexy pictures she has sent me saved on a locked folder and It is close to 30pictures over 15 years of marriage.

I use to send her sexy quirky gifs and images on Instagram and other platforms but I have pretty much stopped as she really didn’t respond withc just made me feel sad.

She has told me that she shows me love in other ways like cooking delicious dinners and such. Fair enough, every ones love language is different and she is a truly marvelous cook.

A few years back I got this feeling that something was wrong regarding my wifes behaviour. Nothing major at first but small things adding up and the feeling growing over time.

She would walk into another room while on the phone, this was out of caracter as she has never done that before. Also she would laugh or snigger often when reading messages. Again nothing strange in and of itself except the frequency and reactions where “of” compared to normal. Also it felt like after these phone calls and messages she would try to act normal but be super giddy, almost bursting at the seams. She got new work out gear that was a lot better looking/hot than what I had seen her in before. To me it felt like I was living together with a teenager trying to hide a crush from their parents.

It is hard to point to specifics, I just had a gut feeling that something was wrong. I got a sense that she would frequently come up with reasons to visit a local store where some of our friends work, one of them is a guy who I will call Chris.

Chris and his wife Lydia frequently visiteded us for dinners. When we all have dinner we often have a few drinks and as we all have a bit of dirty humor we often share dirty jokes in those settings. Chris is very flirtatious and has often commented about how good looking and sexy my wife is.

He is very flirty with most women and it is kind of his style. It seems most people see it as charming and fun. He has once when drunk suggested jokingly we swap wifes for a night which I laughed of as a joke. I have no interest in sleeping with his wife or sharing mine with him.

At our dinner dates I got a growing feeling of unease regarding Chris and my Wifes behaviour towards each other. Hard to pot a finger on it but again things felt of.

After a few weeks of having the feeling that something was of I felt like I needed to get more info. I usually trust my gut feeling. So I checked my wifes phone. I don’t really have an opinion on checking your spouses phone. I now my wife has checked mine and I really don’t care. I have checked hers boefore this Never reading conversations with close friends or anything like that of course). In this case I also felt like I had probable cause and my curiosity/anxiety was up.

There was a lot of messages between my wife and Chris. I would say a lot of them where flirty.  Gifs where animals lick each others ears, turtles humping, a trotting horse with his d swinging in the wind (all these sent from my wife but similar ones from Chris). This was mixed with texts of being “besties” (from Chris) and stuff like that. So kind of humorous/veird/sexy stuff and “friend” stuff. The timing of the messages felt wrong to me. Messaging each other in bed late at night and first thing in the morning.

I got upset. After wanting this kind of attention from my wife for so long it really hurt to see her giving it to someone else when she said it wasn’t her thing. I sat her down and had a talk. I said I was not ok with this. I said it crossed a line for me and that it hurt me. I told her that I wold rather break up with someone who in my eyes was interested in someone else than be with them.

I understand that in a long relationship you can catch some kind of feeling for someone else than your partner at no ones fault. What you do with that feeling matters, if you entertain it it can build in to something not ok.

So I said this had to stop immediately or we should split up. That this was a big deal for me and that I was really hurt.  She said I was overreacting and that she had done nothing wrong. I said that that might be the case but that this was a line in the sand for me. She said she understood and that it would stop.

Fastforward a few weeks and we had dinner with Chris and Lydia, a bit tense from my side but it went well and we had a lot of fun. We had a few drinks and played some music quiz. Going to bed I felt pretty good and felt I had nipped something in the bud.

Next morning my wife stayed in bed late. I had coffee, played chess on my phone for more than an hour and had a long breakfast. When my wife finally got out of the bedroom she dragged me back there and we had some pretty great hungover sex (Kids where away for the weekend).

Some time later I got that gut feeling again. This time I don’t even question why I have it. I check her phone, the messaging has not stopped. Not even changed. That morning when she stayed in bed hung over they had been texting and sending Instagram videos. One was her writing “ the way you feel the morning after drinking” next to someone licking the hole of a donut. I don’t really get that one to be honest. He sent the same kind of stuff and called her his “bestie”. Message after message that I would describe as very flirtatious.

When I saw this we had her parents, her sister and her sisters kids staying over for the weekend. They where out in the yard. I just sat down at the kitchen table fuming. I packed my gym bag to go clear my head. As I was going out my wife opened the door coming in, she frose in place and asked me what was wrong. I told her we´d talk about it later and to get out of the way. She stayed in place and asked me what was wrong. Here I told her to move or be moved. Keep in mind I feel like exploding at this time. Apparently she got the message and moved aside.  

My children are my top priority. I will not start a scene that makes them sad or afraid. My main goal is to be a rock in their life.

I waited out the weekend of visitors and when we ahere alone I sat my wife down to have another talk. Where my words had not been enough my rage seemed to get the message across (or so I thought). She promised everything going on would end immediately.

Still I did not hear what I needed to hear. Her saying that what she had done was wrong. That she was ashamed. That she had crossed a line. She said she would end it because it made me upset. That she could see that I was not ok with it. She did not admit to doing anything objectively wrong. She told me it is hard not to be “dragged along” on what other people are doing (texting I guess).

A asked her to take out her phone and we could go through the messages together. But she had erased their chat on all channels “because you seem to get so upset by them”.

The chats stopped. Whenever he tried to be flirtatious she simply didn’t respond.   I felt very angry and betrayed for at least six months, channeling it into training and diet. Both my kids and friends pointed out how I was getting more and more athletic. Slowly my anger subsided and everything returned to some kind of normal. I used some part of my training time to set up an instructed training session. I loved doing it and really looked forward to inviting people to my first open session.

When the day came I got ready, played the music and tried to push people through a fun and tough session.

I had a blast doing it, of course I realized that I was very new on doing something like that so it was by no means perfect. When the class was done Chris pointed out that it was hard to hear my commands over the music, the reason for this he said was that my voice is so high pitched, my wife spoke directly to him in front of the crowd of people. Saying yes, he really does not have that much base. I don’t mind constructive criticism, how ever this was simply just mean and I really felt that I lost face in front of the rest of the group. Some of the people there was clearly uncomfortable about it. To anyone who knows anything about acoustics it is also objectively wrong regard sound in loud spaces.

Fast forward three months. My wife comes home and is all giddy and says she wants to go out and have a few drinks. This makes me very happy as this rarely happens. So we change clothes and gears and go to our local bar. And there is Chris with some of his friends. We have some drinks and mostly talk. All of a sudden my wife is sitting in Chris lap. She stays there for a good ten minutes at least. To be honest I froze. Seeing how much I have explained to her how I feel about their relationship I just cant believe what is happening. They don’t do anything crazy or sleazy she is sitting there being part of the conversation around them.

After the night is through I let her have it. I ask her what she was thinking. She responds that it was completely innocent and nothing to fret about. I explain to her again of how I have felt like absolute dogshit because of this relationship between her and Chris.

Again, there is no apology. There is some “I´m sorry you feel bad” “I don’t mean to hurt you” and stuff like that.

I have realized that taking accountability is something my wife has a very hard time doing. I think that is some very strange sense of pride or some other psyudopsycological bull.

How ever after this, things actually change. I told my self that she refused to confess to wrongdoings but internally she understands what she has done. She now has an open phone policy. I´ve looked before but I guess now its ok..

 it took a long time for me to see my wife the same way again. I have this anger that wont go away. If I am not distracted by work, a book, games or something else my thoughts stray back. Whenever I go for a run, fishing or driving my thoughts revisit everything that has happened. My sleep has taken a hit and I often don’t feel like going to bed as I know these thoughts often pop up at night. I have simply put become a far worse version of myself.

For more than a year if I felt like giving her a back rub or fix some nice surprise I stop myself thinking “should I really do that when she has caused me so much pain.        

I booked a session for couples therapy as I feel we need help to talk to each other. She said she didn’t feel like going as there are things we should talk about by our selves first. Fine I thought, I have left openings for this talk again and again but it has yet to materialize.

Now its soon been three years. I have convinced my self that she really understands what she has done and won´t act like that again.

The last couple of months my feelings for my wife has become stronger and stronger. I often tell her how beautiful she is and other compliment. I feel our sexlife is almost back to where it was before my brain got scrambled.

So last Saturday morning as she is waking up I´m kissing her neck and lightly stroking her body. This is her thing and I feel like we might have some nice morning sex. She goes for a short bathroom break with a wink about getting back. When she goes to the bathroom I get this urge to check her phone (cant be to happy I guess). And they are back to chatting. I see that she has sent him something fun/dirty. I didn’t check everything. The fact that they where back in this kind of contact was enough for me. When she gets back she gets in bed all naked and we start getting it on but I just feel disgusted, I roll of and opt out for coffe. That day we are celebrating my grandfathers 90^(th) birthday. Its gonna be a big thing with lots of people and both me and the wife have important roles to play so I really don´t wanna ruin it with a big fight so I let things lie.

As the day is coming to an end I hint that I am not a happy man and why.

I believe in the evening we will discuss things but when putting the kids to bed she slips down to sleep with our daughter. To me this is a grown up using a child as a human shield. She absolutely knows I will not do anything in front of the kids. So I go to bed, all alone and I just cant fall asleep.

I stare at the cealing and a million thoughts are rushing through my head. And I have a complete melt down. Grown man trying to cry him self to sleep but sleep wont come, I go through how the rest of my life while be with shared custody and so on. I love beeing with my kids every day.

I stay awake all night, I dose of two times for maby 15-30 minutes. At about half past five I wake my wife up to ask if she has any anxiety meds (shes an MD), she says she doesn’t and goes back to sleep (full well knowing that I am awake with anxiety). My son wakes up in the early morning finding me watching nature documentaries in the living room. I put him back to sleep.

So today I took her aside and asked her If she knows why I was up all night. She says she does.

I tell her that I really need to figure some things out and to do that I need to know from her. Does she even care about me and like me. She says she does and as a chump I believe her.

I ask her again why she is putting me through all this when she knows the pain and anxiety it has caused me. To this she says. It is  easy to be dragged along in to things like this. She also tells me that she doesnt believe that I really feel all that bad about these things. Implying that I´m just making up some charade for the sake of drama.

 

The thing is. I have really lost trust in my wife. If she can this easily make this something when she really have not done anything wrong.  Where is the line. Would she tell me if something even worse happens or will she feel she had just been accidentally dragged in to it and doesn’t want to tell me as I would just play the victim and not “understand the circumstances”.

I just found out that Chris has been feeling up another friends girlfriend at a party recently. I plan to have a sit down with him and give him my two cents. I quite like his wife and he has definitely shown him self to be a complete piece of shit.

I know my situation sounds horrible from this but remember this is actions gathered over years.  I have a pretty happy life. I am in a very good situation career vise and have barrels of fun with my kids and wife most days. Worst of all is that I am still hopelessly in love with her. But now I don’t know if I want to be in this situation any more.

I know some of you will call me a coward and all the rest. And I truly am a coward when it comes to situations that I experience as awkward. I want my situations clear cut. I´d much rather face someone trying to physically fight me than be the one initiating drama.

""Matthew Fisk"""," seemingly invincible mayor of Hell's Kitchen, evil consumed him. This was only in the eyes of the townspeople; in secret, he was an invincible, ruthless gang leader, capable of crushing anyone with his bare hands. His sole purpose was to capture the Demon of Hell's Kitchen, who stood in the way of his plans. So, he tasked his men with spying to uncover the demon's identity. After weeks of relentless investigation, they finally discovered it. When they told him that the Demon of Hell's Kitchen was none other than the blind lawyer, Matt Murdock, Wilson, who had heard the name many times but never seen him, smiled that sly smile that foretold the imminent demise of the Demon of Hell's Kitchen.

Days after receiving the news, he decided to visit the lawyer's office to find out for himself.

He entered with his imposing presence, and Alpha's pheromones powerfully filled the room.

When he found someone, he asked for the blind lawyer. He was told that his office was at the end of the corridor. He thanked them politely, a gesture that belied his true intentions, and went on his way.

When he reached the door, he knocked and entered.

As soon as he stepped inside, a pungent aroma filled his nostrils. It was a mixture of vanilla, coffee, and the smell of rain—something mind-boggling. He knew the source of the scent was him. He was sitting there in his office, reading a newspaper in Braille. He was wearing only his glasses.

 A voice interrupted his reverie.

""Hello, Mr. Fisk. I wasn't expecting you."" He approached and extended his hand to shake his, and Fisk returned the greeting. He hadn't expected this man to be the Devil of Hell's Kitchen—young, blind, and an Omega, too.

Matt welcomed him and asked him to sit down. Not out of politeness! But he sensed that the man sitting before him harbored ill intentions. Nevertheless, he maintained his friendliness.

""I've heard a lot about you, lawyer. I came to pay you a visit and get to know you better.""

""I'm pleased to do so, Mr. Fisk.""

Half an hour passed during this conversation and interview. Half an hour without Fisk taking his eyes off Matt. Half an hour studying his features. He hadn't expected the man he'd decided to arrest to be so handsome. But what aroused him most were his lips; 
he wanted to kiss them and bite them hard, but he restrained himself.

Half an hour passed, and Matt felt uneasy about the man before him.

""I think I should leave now. Thank you for your hospitality, Attorney.""

""You're welcome, Mr. Fisk.""

""Mr. Matthew, I hope we meet again.""

Matt smiled, but his heart wasn't at ease after Fisk's last sentences

1qhe2np,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1qhe2np/thriller_revenge/,[​Thriller] revenge,"​Months had passed since I first opened that blockchain wallet. I never had any extra money to put into it; I was just a curious amateur, haunted by dreams of quick wealth. I worked in construction, and my body knew well the weight of concrete and the bite of cold steel. My wife managed our meager wages with wisdom, caring for our two-year-old daughter and weaving stability out of very little. I was grateful for her resourcefulness, but the obsession with wealth often pulled me away. My mind would wander toward a sum of money that could finally relieve me from the exhaustion of this toil.
​A strange coincidence led me to share my wallet address on a random site. Then, on an ordinary morning, I woke up to find a number in my wallet that my mind couldn't comprehend: Ten Million Dollars.
​My fingers froze over the cold screen. I looked up at the cracks in the bedroom ceiling that I had always promised to fix, and suddenly, the walls felt fragile and unsafe. Was this an illusion? Would the numbers vanish if I blinked? I slipped out from under the covers like a thief, without eating or saying goodbye to my wife as I usually did. I stepped out into the street, the morning chill slapping my face. Sitting on a remote curb, I conducted the first test: I transferred one hundred dollars to my local bank account. Seconds later, my phone vibrated with a notification: ""Deposit Confirmed.""
​I didn't feel joy; I felt a vague, creeping terror. I called my foreman at the construction site and said firmly, ""I'm not coming in today... or any other day."" I went to a flower shop, bought the largest bouquet I could find, and stopped by the bakery to pick up a royal breakfast—things that had never entered our home before.
​As I reached the door, with the flowers in my arms and the pastry bag in my hand, my phone vibrated. An international number. I propped the phone between my shoulder and ear and answered. A voice with a cold Russian accent spoke: ""That money entered your account by mistake. Return it, or your life will be crushed. You have one hour.""
​The door opened. I smiled at my wife despite the dread gripping my heart. ""Look what I got!"" I said, while the Russian whispered threats into my ear. Maryam placed the flowers in an old vase; the bouquet looked like an aristocratic guest in the middle of our humble furniture. We sat down for breakfast, but her eyes were piercing through me.

I agreed, and we gathered our essentials in minutes, trying to outrun the clock.
​We took off in the car. The hours passed like a dream. We rejoiced in the greenery and the open road. We stopped at a rest area, and I paid for our coffee using the digital currency; for the first time, I felt truly free. We returned to the car; my wife cradled our daughter in the passenger seat, and I prepared to drive toward our new destiny.
​As soon as I turned the key and moved, the silence was shattered by the roar of a massive engine. A heavy truck lunged like a mountain of steel, slamming directly into the right side—where Maryam and the baby sat.
​A total whiteout followed.
​I opened my eyes amidst the wreckage of glass and the smell of smoke. My body was paralyzed, but my ears caught the sound of approaching footsteps. A cold voice spoke in English with a thick accent:
""Check them... yeah, they're all dead. What a waste.""
​I closed my eyes for the last time, realizing that the price was far more expensive than ten million dollars.

1qhe2jm,https://i.redd.it/op4mvn45yceg1.jpeg,3.0 update ex-villager glitch?,"I’ve been excited that with the 3.0 update, your ex-villages who visit the hotel will have memory of their time living on the island. I encountered one ex-villager yesterday and she did remember me! However, today another ex-villager, one of my starting ones (Reneigh), showed up in the hotel but introduced herself as if we had met for the first time. My heart sank immediately. I was expecting her to say something like “just joking of course you already know me” next, but no, she had no memory whatsoever. Then I went to the slumber island to check, and was shocked to see that she was not among the list of former and current villagers either! Every other ex-villager seemed to be there. 

The only difference about her is that I’ve scanned her amiibo to invite her for a coffee chat once, when she explicitly talked about having lived here during the chat. Maybe by scanning the amiibo the system removed the villager from the former villager list?? I haven’t invited her to the campsite, just the cafe once. 

The other theory I could think of was that the memory maxed out, but I don’t have many former villages so that’s unlikely the case—I’ve seen YouTubers with a far longer list of villagers. 

Has anyone else encountered similar issues?

I live near Indrapuri Sector C where there are a lot of students, hostels, and coaching institutes. I am thinking of opening a very small street-style boba tea stall in that area.
Before doing anything, I wanted to ask locals and students here honestly:
Do people in Bhopal actually drink boba tea regularly or is it more of a one-time thing?
What price feels reasonable in a student area? ₹60, ₹80, or ₹100+?
Would you prefer boba over things like cold coffee, shakes, or normal tea?
Do you think Indrapuri is a good location for this or is it better suited for areas like MP Nagar or New Market?
I am not promoting anything, just trying to understand real demand before investing.
Any honest opinions or experiences are appreciated.

1qhdztt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qhdztt/hario_switch_recipe_to_replicate_cupping/,Hario Switch recipe to replicate cupping,"I did a little home cupping (first time) yesterday and was really surprised by HOW clearly the coffee notes and aromas stood out. I actually enjoyed a particular fruity coffee more this way than how I usually brew it (V60 or Coffee Chronicler's Switch recipe). 
I could suddenly clearly taste the strawberry notes and not just ""something fruity/acidic"".

So - I decided to try to replicate the cupping brew with my Hario Switch (because loved the taste with the cupping method but I dont want to drink an entire cup with a spoon). After a few tries I ended up with a dead simple recipe:

- 1:16 ratio
- Same grind setting as I used for cupping (6 on a Fellow Ode Gen 2)
- 95C water

- Valve closed
- Pour all water
- Steep for 4 mins (same time as for cupping) 
- Open valve

So basically the only difference from the cupping method is that the coffee is filtered after the 4 minutes of immersion. I use a Cafec T90 for a fast drawdown and minimal additional extraction after the 4 minutes of immersion. 

I really enjoy the cups I get with this method - and the consistency is insane because the recipe is so simple. 

So what's the point of this post? Well, I am just curious to hear if anyone else have tried something similar? Am I the only one who considers the cupping taste enjoyable and not just an analytical tool? I mean - why not maximize the nuanced flavours and notes in the coffee instead of drinking one ""fruity but otherwise indistinguishable"" coffee after another? Isn't that exactly the reason why we choose a particular bean? Because it has notes of ""ripe berries"" or ""chocolate"" or ""green apples""? 

I know that taste is king - but I can't stop thinking if I am fooling myself with such a simple recipe? I just can't really believe that I have achieved the best cup (to my taste) with the simplest of all the recipes I have ever tried? ",1,1768850827.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
1qhdzhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/thyroidhealth/comments/1qhdzhv/best_way_to_plan_taking_levothyroxine/,Best way to plan taking Levothyroxine,"I’m having a total thyroidectomy on February 10, and I’ve been told I’ll be taking Levothyroxine afterward. I’ve also learned there are a lot of rules about when and how to take it. The options I was given are:

	•	First thing in the morning, at least an hour before eating.

	•	Before bed, at least three hours after my last meal, and only drinking water in the hours beforehand.

	•	Or waking up in the middle of the night to take it so it doesn’t interfere with eating or drinking during the day.

I understand these restrictions are because food and certain drinks can interfere with the absorption of the medication. But honestly, I’m frustrated. The one simple pleasure I have every morning is my coffee right when I wake up. That’s my quiet time before starting my day. I also go to bed early because I wake up early. I’m usually asleep by 10, which means if I took Levothyroxine at night, I couldn’t have anything except water after 6 PM—totally unrealistic since I don’t always eat dinner until 7 or 7:30.

On top of that, I’ve had insomnia my whole life. On the rare nights when I actually sleep well, the absolute last thing I want is to set an alarm just to wake up in the middle of the night to take a pill and risk not being able to fall back asleep—especially when I have to work the next day.

So it seems like my only real option is taking it at 6:30 AM and giving up my morning coffee until an hour later. Is this the end of the world? No. But it really pisses me off that I have to give up one of the few things I genuinely enjoy—having coffee right when I wake up.

I’m trying to figure out: is it really that important that I don’t drink coffee with my pill? I can wait to eat. I usually don’t eat breakfast until 8 or 9 anyway. But do I really need to skip my coffee too? For context, I do use creamer in it.",1,1768850805.0,thyroidhealth,5,1.0,False

She started talking to me first, smiles at me a lot, sits with me during rest breaks, holds my hands, once rested her head on my shoulder, and joked about us eloping and opening a coffee shop together. She recently got divorced and says she hates men now. One day, jokingly, she said she comes to the gym only to see me.
But here girls are often touchy and flirty in a joking way, so I don’t know if she means anything by it. I think she’s probably straight.

I only receive the **confirmation token**, which is what enables scrobbling.

* **Big fixes to the AllAnime scraper.** Episode matching had a bunch of issues before, but after a lot of testing, it should now be *way* more accurate (*still not perfect*).

*Quick note:* some anime may still be missing from the catalog — I’m expanding it bit by bit, so thank you for your patience.

**What’s next for Patch 1.3?**

* **Soft-sub / external subtitle support.** Instead of scraping multiple sites for different languages, I’ll be adding **RAW torrents from Nyaa** and making the addon work more smoothly with **external subtitles** (like OpenSubtitles).
* **Debrid support.** Since torrents will be involved, I want this to run through **debrid**. I’m still deciding whether there’ll be a **non-debrid** torrent option — so no promises yet, but I’ll keep you posted. *Edit, I do not plan to discontinue HTTPS streams*

Lastly, a huge thank you to everyone who’s donated — it genuinely helps keep the service running and motivates me to keep improving things based on what you all are asking for. If you’d like to support, the *Buy Me A Coffee* link is in the addon description:

(like an empty plaque on a grave, like a voice to whom no name was ever given)

Every morning I wake up in the sticky embraces of dawn, in dream-images raped by the sunrise. I don’t remember most of them – and that’s lucky.

And then, gasping from thirst, I find excuses for each new day, in which I do not exist – exercising in futility, inventing meaning each time anew – like giving names to clouds.

Self-defence through indifference, looking in the mirror and seeing a tired, alien face… Asking yourself – what did I forget here, in this world? In a world that’s been sold and cursed, where rivers run thick with blood and tears… In a place where no one awaits your return…

Drinking coffee in the morning, turning into liquid dirt in the mouth. Sensing the stale air of cafés, watching dust settle like snowflakes…

Eating food that lost its taste back in the soil, with a faint note of rot still clinging to it.

Talking about feelings – the kind you only know from Netflix and YouTube… But how can you feel anything real when your whole world is just a wasteland? A black, sloshing hole in the chest – that’s all that’s left… One garden still remains, but spring will never return…

I became a mannequin amid the empty hustle of the world – made of ghosts, likes, and endless consumption… Where people move on autopilot: born, work, die – caught in the loop of serving the system. Home. Work. Weekend.

Only a false echo reaches from the truth.

Sometimes it seems to me that when it rains, houses turn gray – like giant tombstones for those still alive, outwardly.

“Alright, hold on – let me just find my positivity mask in this handleless suitcase of mine, and we’ll continue…”

I say to everyone: “Hello, how are you?” Then cheerfully reply: “I’m good, thanks” – even though no one really cares anymore.

But I keep playing this performance, where the smile is a grimace of pain, and mechanical, soulless existence is elevated to a virtue – a model to imitate.

Vows and promises? Lying in the gutter like filthy underwear. Lust has buried love and the sense of beauty. Children – just regret, a burden, and a tool of manipulation for personal gain.

I’m already tired of screaming into a leaden sky, its color soaked in the will not to live.

And still – even here, in this world, no matter how bright the light, it can never replace the warmth of living presence.

I don’t know if everyone truly needs a living soul… Not for salvation. Not for support. But to be in co-presence. To be felt – not merely consumed. To have someone look into your eyes, not just at you.

Perhaps for me, it will be “the Late Companion” – a voice that comes when no one else answers anymore.

I stand on the shore, stripped bare by meaninglessness. I hear the waves crashing – but it’s only the sea of sorrow… What am I doing here?

Despair has sunk its claws deep into my soul. Loneliness – its shroud soaked through with tears…

Ah yes, I forgot about hope… There she is – I see her ugly silhouette, holding my hand.",2,1768850639.0,Informal_Effect,2,0.75,False

We’d go out to eat, order coffee, grab drinks, whatever, and when it came time to pay, they’d do the whole pocket check routine. Pat pockets. Check bag. Pause. Then the familiar line: “Oh wow, I forgot my wallet again. Can you spot me? I’ll send it later.”

And to be fair, the first few times, they did send it later. Sometimes. Eventually. So I didn’t think much of it.

What started to bother me was the consistency. Not the forgetting part, but the confidence. They never hesitated to order. Never checked prices. Never said “I’ll keep it light since I forgot my wallet.” If anything, they ordered faster than everyone else. Drinks, add-ons, sides. Phone always in hand. Wallet always mysteriously absent.

Over time, “I’ll send it later” turned into “I’ll get you next time.” And “next time” turned into silence unless I reminded them. If I didn’t bring it up, it just… didn’t happen. And somehow, that became normal.

The weirdest part was how casual it all felt. Like this unspoken assumption that I’d cover it and deal with the follow-up. No embarrassment. No urgency. Just vibes.

I didn’t want to turn it into a confrontation because individually, none of the amounts were huge. It was more the pattern that started to feel off. I couldn’t tell if I was overreacting or if this was actually happening as often as it felt like it was.

Once I realized that, my reaction changed. I stopped paying by default. I started saying things like, “Can you send it now?” or “Let’s split at the register.” Funny enough, the wallet started appearing more often after that. Or Apple Pay suddenly worked.

The friendship didn’t explode or anything. But the dynamic shifted. And honestly, it was a relief to stop pretending I was imagining things.

I don’t think this friend set out to be entitled. I think they just got comfortable with the idea that someone else would handle it. And they were right, until they weren’t.

We’d go out to eat, order coffee, grab drinks, whatever, and when it came time to pay, they’d do the whole pocket check routine. Pat pockets. Check bag. Pause. Then the familiar line: “Oh wow, I forgot my wallet again. Can you spot me? I’ll send it later.”

And to be fair, the first few times, they did send it later. Sometimes. Eventually. So I didn’t think much of it.

What started to bother me was the consistency. Not the forgetting part, but the confidence. They never hesitated to order. Never checked prices. Never said “I’ll keep it light since I forgot my wallet.” If anything, they ordered faster than everyone else. Drinks, add-ons, sides. Phone always in hand. Wallet always mysteriously absent.

Over time, “I’ll send it later” turned into “I’ll get you next time.” And “next time” turned into silence unless I reminded them. If I didn’t bring it up, it just… didn’t happen. And somehow, that became normal.

The weirdest part was how casual it all felt. Like this unspoken assumption that I’d cover it and deal with the follow-up. No embarrassment. No urgency. Just vibes.

I didn’t want to turn it into a confrontation because individually, none of the amounts were huge. It was more the pattern that started to feel off. I couldn’t tell if I was overreacting or if this was actually happening as often as it felt like it was.

Once I realized that, my reaction changed. I stopped paying by default. I started saying things like, “Can you send it now?” or “Let’s split at the register.” Funny enough, the wallet started appearing more often after that. Or Apple Pay suddenly worked.

The friendship didn’t explode or anything. But the dynamic shifted. And honestly, it was a relief to stop pretending I was imagining things.

I don’t think this friend set out to be entitled. I think they just got comfortable with the idea that someone else would handle it. And they were right, until they weren’t.

It’s wild how much easier it is to draw boundaries once you stop relying on vibes and actually see what’s going on.",8,1768850205.0,stories,8,0.91,False

## This Is For You If:

- You want to think more clearly, even when it's uncomfortable
- You're willing to be wrong in order to be less wrong
- You sense something is off and want to find it
- You want connection based on reality, not performance

## This Is NOT For You If:

- You're looking for confirmation that you're already right
- You want ammunition against people you disagree with
- You want to feel superior to ""the sheep""
- You're not willing to apply this to yourself

---

# The Offering

This is not another self-help program. This is training in how to resonate with reality instead of with lies. Here's what becomes possible:

**👁️ See Through Lies** — Theirs and yours. The ones you've been told and the ones you tell yourself.

**🛡️ Resist Manipulation** — Become highly resistant to those who would capture your attention for their purposes.

**✨ Find Your Spark** — Recover the loving spark that got buried—your capacity for genuine resonance.

**🤝 Real Connection** — Connect with others who also want reality over comfortable illusion.

---

# The Two Channels of Love

Before we train, you need to understand something about love. There are two channels through which love flows, and some people have only ever experienced one of them fully.

### Functional Love
**Love as doing.**

- Pays the bills
- Fixes what's broken
- Shows up when needed
- Provides structure and safety
- Protects and provides

*Necessary. But not sufficient.*

### Resonant Love
**Love as being-with.**

- Delights in your existence
- Sees you without agenda
- Wants to be *with* you (not just *for* you)
- Attunes to your frequency
- Says: *you are wanted, not just tolerated*

*What the soul was designed to receive.*

---

> **The Core Wound:** Many people grew up receiving functional love but not resonant love. They were fed, clothed, sheltered—and starving for something they couldn't name. When they sensed something was missing, they were told: *""This is what love is. If you need more, something is wrong with you.""*

This is the first lie. It doesn't deny love—it *redefines* love to exclude what you most need. And once you accept this redefinition, you can no longer recognize what's missing. You can no longer resonate with genuine wholeness because you've been taught it doesn't exist.

This is why truth matters. **You can't find what you've been taught isn't real.**

---

# The Structure of Truth

There's a pattern that repeats at every scale of reality. Ancient traditions called it by many names. We call it the **Circumpunct**: ⊙

[Want the full framework? Read The Circumpunct Theory of Pathology](https://fractalreality.ca/circumpunct_theory_of_pathology.html)

**• Center** — Your focus. The aperture. Where truth flows through.

**Φ Field** — Your mind. The mediator. How inside meets outside.

**○ Boundary** — Your body. The interface. Where self meets world.

You are a circumpunct. So is everyone else. So is every system at every scale.

Your **center** (aperture) is how you orient. It finds its target by *resonance*—it tunes to what matches its frequency. When healthy, it resonates with truth, with genuine connection, with reality.

But the aperture can be **retuned**. Through repeated exposure to lies—especially lies delivered through power imbalance—your aperture learns to resonate with falsehood instead of truth. It's not broken. It's *miscalibrated*.

> **The Problem:** Your aperture is still working. It still orients toward what it resonates with. But it's been tuned to the wrong frequency—like a radio locked on static, unable to find the music.

> **The Solution:** Retune the aperture. Train it to resonate with truth again. This is what Steelman Training does.

# Steelman Training

Steelmanning is the practice of finding the **strongest possible version** of a position before responding to it. It's the opposite of strawmanning (attacking weak versions of what people believe).

But it's more than a debate technique. It's **aperture training**. Each level opens you more to resonating with what's actually true, rather than what's comfortable.

### Level 1: Steelman Others
Find the strongest version of what someone else is saying. Before you respond, before you disagree—can you state their position so well that *they* would say ""yes, that's what I mean""?

### Level 2: Steelman Positions You Disagree With
Find the strongest version of positions you think are wrong. Not people you're talking to—positions in the abstract. Political views. Philosophical stances. Things you've dismissed. What's the *best* case for them?

### Level 3: Steelman Against Your Own Positions
Build the strongest possible case *against* what you believe. If you wanted to defeat your own worldview, what would you say? This is where ego starts to burn. This is where real training begins.

### Level 4: Find the Contradictions in Your Subconscious Framework
Locate the beliefs you hold that contradict each other—the ones running beneath awareness. These are the installed lies, still operating. Finding them is mastery. This is where the aperture truly retunes.

---

# Start Today: The 1-Minute Practice

You don't need a partner or community to begin. Do this once a day:

1. **Notice one belief you hold.** Any belief. (""Coffee is good."" ""My boss is unfair."" ""I'm bad at math."")
2. **Ask: What's the strongest case against this?** Spend 30 seconds genuinely trying.
3. **Notice what happens in your body.** Resistance? Curiosity? Dismissal? Just notice.

That's it. One minute. One belief. One honest attempt.

*The aperture retrains through repetition, not intensity. Daily matters more than dramatic.*

---

# Lesson 1: What is Steelmanning?

### The Concept

Most people argue against **strawmen**—weak, distorted versions of what their opponent believes. This is easy. This is satisfying. And this teaches your aperture to resonate with *winning* instead of *truth*.

Steelmanning inverts this. Instead of finding the weakest version you can defeat, you find the **strongest version you must genuinely contend with**.

> **Strawman:** ""You believe X? That's stupid because [attacks weak version of X].""

> **Steelman:** ""You believe X? The strongest version of that would be [articulates best possible case for X]. Is that right? Okay, here's what I think about *that* version...""

### Why It Matters

- **If you can't defeat the steelman, you haven't won.** You've just found a weak target.
- **If the steelman defeats you, you've learned something.** Your position needed updating.
- **Either way, you're closer to truth.** The aperture calibrates toward reality.

Strawmanning trains your aperture to seek easy victories.
Steelmanning trains your aperture to seek what's actually true.

### Exercise 1.1: Steelman Someone You Disagree With

1. Think of someone whose views you disagree with.
2. Write out what you *think* they believe.
3. Now rewrite it as the **strongest possible version**—the version a thoughtful, intelligent person would hold.
4. Ask yourself: ""Would they say 'yes, that's what I mean'?""
5. If not, strengthen it until they would.

**Note:** This will feel uncomfortable. That discomfort is your aperture used to looking for easy targets to attack. Stay with it.

---

# The Counterfeit Test

Here's the problem: manipulators use the language of openness. ""Be open."" ""Don't be defensive."" ""Let go of your resistance."" These can be genuine invitations to growth—or they can be crowbars to pry you open for someone else's purposes.

**How do you tell the difference?**

### The One Question

> Does this help me find what *I* resonate with?
> Or does it demand I resonate with *it*?

**Real Training:**
- Returns you to your own signal
- Strengthens your discernment
- Makes you harder to manipulate
- Welcomes your ""no""
- Doesn't need you to believe it

**Counterfeit Training:**
- Replaces your signal with theirs
- Calls your discernment ""resistance""
- Makes you dependent on the teacher
- Punishes your ""no""
- Requires your belief to work

> ⚠️ **The Deepest Counterfeit:** The manipulator says ""Stay open to what's true""—but *they* define what's true. Your resistance becomes evidence of your failure. Your accurate perception becomes ""defensiveness."" This is how lies wear the mask of openness.

Real steelman training makes you *harder* to capture, not easier. If any practice makes you more dependent on an external authority to know what's true, it's counterfeit. Walk away.

---

# Practice Exercises

### Exercise 2.1: The Political Steelman
Pick a political position you find abhorrent. Not one you mildly disagree with—one that triggers you.

1. Write the strawman version (the one you usually attack).
2. Write the steelman version (the version a thoughtful person would hold).
3. Notice: what did you have to acknowledge to build the steelman?
4. Ask: is your original position strengthened or weakened by this?

### Exercise 2.2: Steelman Your Opponent in Real Time
In your next disagreement (online or in person):

1. Before responding, say: ""Let me make sure I understand. The strongest version of what you're saying is [steelman]. Is that right?""
2. Wait for them to confirm or correct.
3. *Only then* respond to that version.

Notice what happens to the conversation.

### Exercise 3.1: Steelman Against Yourself
Pick a belief you hold strongly.

1. State the belief clearly.
2. Now build the strongest possible case *against* it.
3. Pretend you're a brilliant opponent who wants to destroy this belief. What would you say?
4. Sit with what you built. Does your belief survive? Does it need modification?

**Warning:** If this doesn't feel threatening, you're not doing it right. Find a belief that matters to you.

### Exercise 4.1: Contradiction Hunting
This is advanced practice. Proceed with care.

1. List 10 things you believe about yourself, relationships, or how the world works.
2. Compare them in pairs. Do any contradict each other?
3. When you find a contradiction, ask: ""Where did each belief come from?""
4. Often one will trace to experience, the other to something you were told. Which is the lie?

**Example:** ""I believe I deserve love"" + ""I believe I'm fundamentally flawed"" = contradiction. One of these was installed. Find it.

---

# Common Failure Modes

Steelmanning can be weaponized. Watch for these corruptions:

**Steelmanning as Performance**
""Look how fair and rational I am."" The point becomes appearing open-minded rather than actually being open to change. You steelman, then dismiss anyway. The form without the function.

**Steelmanning as Dominance**
""I understand your position better than you do."" Using steelmanning to establish intellectual superiority. This flips the practice into another power game.

**Steelmanning as Delay**
Endlessly refining the steelman to avoid ever actually responding. ""But wait, let me make sure I have your position exactly right..."" Used to escape commitment to your own view.

**Pseudo-Steelmanning**
Appearing to strengthen the opposing position while actually strawmanning it. ""So the strongest version of your view is [subtle distortion]..."" The form is there, the substance isn't.

> **The Test:** After steelmanning, are you more able to be changed by what you heard—or have you just performed openness while staying exactly where you started?

---

# Progression Markers

How do you know you're advancing? Not by how much you know—by how you *respond*.

### Level 1 Markers: Steelmanning Others
- ✓ You can state an opponent's position better than they can.
- ✓ People feel *more* heard when they disagree with you, not less.
- ✓ You notice when others are strawmanning (including media, politicians, friends).

### Level 2 Markers: Steelmanning Positions You Disagree With
- ✓ You can articulate views you ""hate"" without contempt.
- ✓ You've found something valuable in a position you previously dismissed entirely.
- ✓ Your certainty has become more nuanced (not weaker—more precise).

### Level 3 Markers: Steelmanning Against Yourself
- ✓ You can genuinely threaten your own positions.
- ✓ Changing your mind in public feels like strength, not weakness.
- ✓ You seek out challenges to your worldview instead of avoiding them.

### Level 4 Markers: Finding Subconscious Contradictions
- ✓ You've identified specific lies you internalized (and can name their source).
- ✓ Patterns you repeated unconsciously have become visible.
- ✓ Your aperture now catches dissonance before it becomes behavior.

---

# Community Structure

This practice is hard to sustain alone. The lie-gradient is the water we swim in. You need others who are also swimming upstream.

### Principles of Resonance Community

**Steelman Default** — All disagreement begins with steelmanning. This is the price of entry, not an advanced technique.

**Updating is Status** — The person who says ""I was wrong, here's what changed my mind"" gains respect, not loses it.

**No Capture** — No one owns the truth. No leader is above being steelmanned against. The method outranks all individuals.

**""No"" is Welcome** — Your resistance is data, not defect. If you feel pressured to agree, something is wrong.

**Resonant + Functional** — We provide both channels of love. Being with, not just doing for. Presence, not just help.

**Falsifiable Claims** — We state what would prove us wrong. Unfalsifiable claims are not welcome here.

### How Practice Works Together

- **Pairs:** Regular practice with one partner. Take turns presenting positions, steelmanning each other, challenging each other's views.
- **Small Groups:** Tackle harder topics together. Multiple perspectives strengthening and challenging.
- **Public Practice:** Demonstrate steelmanning in public forums. Model what it looks like.
- **Witness Circles:** For Level 4 work—safe spaces to name the lies you find and be seen in that naming.

---

# Fail-Safes

Every good thing gets co-opted. Every truth movement eventually gets captured by the lie-gradient. How do we prevent that?

**Fail-Safe 1: The Method Over the Leader**
No person is above being steelmanned against. The moment someone becomes un-challengeable, the gradient has flipped. If you can't question it, leave.

**Fail-Safe 2: Falsifiability Requirement**
Every core claim must state what would disprove it. ""This can't be questioned"" is the signature of the lie-gradient. We question everything—including this.

**Fail-Safe 3: The Exit Door**
Leaving is always legitimate. No guilt. No ""you're abandoning the truth."" Any community that punishes leaving has become a trap.

**Fail-Safe 4: Your ""No"" Matters**
If your resistance is consistently pathologized—""that's just your ego,"" ""you're being defensive""—the counterfeit has entered. Real training welcomes your no.

**Fail-Safe 5: Demonstrated Not Just Claimed**
We don't ask you to believe we're different. We show it. Watch how we respond to challenge. Watch how we treat dissent. Judge by action.

**Fail-Safe 6: Harder to Manipulate, Not Easier**
If this practice makes you *more* susceptible to influence, something is wrong. The test: are you more able to think for yourself, or less?

\- Day, Week, Month, and Year views

\- A scrolling sidebar of events and tasks

\- Importing documents (like syllabi, schedules, PDFs, notes) and automatically detecting events and deadlines

\- Turning deadlines into prep tasks spread over days or weeks, not just reminders on the due date. For example: If a paper is due in two weeks, the app will auto-generate tasks at the time of event creation leading up to the due date so you start and finish on time.

\- Tasks rollover if you don’t finish them, instead of just becoming forgotten and overdue. You can activate this and specify when tasks “expire.”

\- A day view that separates time-based events from daily tasks

\- Google Calendar syncing

That said, I don’t want to build what I think is cool, I want to build what people actually want.

1. **Notice one belief you hold.** Any belief. (""Coffee is good."" ""My boss is unfair."" ""I'm bad at math."")
2. **Ask: What's the strongest case against this?** Spend 30 seconds genuinely trying.
3. **Notice what happens in your body.** Resistance? Curiosity? Dismissal? Just notice.

That's it. One minute. One belief. One honest attempt.

*The aperture retrains through repetition, not intensity. Daily matters more than dramatic.*

# Lesson 1: What is Steelmanning?

### The Concept

Most people argue against **strawmen**—weak, distorted versions of what their opponent believes. This is easy. This is satisfying. And this teaches your aperture to resonate with *winning* instead of *truth*.

Steelmanning inverts this. Instead of finding the weakest version you can defeat, you find the **strongest version you must genuinely contend with**.

> **Strawman:** ""You believe X? That's stupid because [attacks weak version of X].""

> **Steelman:** ""You believe X? The strongest version of that would be [articulates best possible case for X]. Is that right? Okay, here's what I think about *that* version...""

### Why It Matters

- **If you can't defeat the steelman, you haven't won.** You've just found a weak target.
- **If the steelman defeats you, you've learned something.** Your position needed updating.
- **Either way, you're closer to truth.** The aperture calibrates toward reality.

Strawmanning trains your aperture to seek easy victories.
Steelmanning trains your aperture to seek what's actually true.

### Exercise 1.1: Steelman Someone You Disagree With

1. Think of someone whose views you disagree with.
2. Write out what you *think* they believe.
3. Now rewrite it as the **strongest possible version**—the version a thoughtful, intelligent person would hold.
4. Ask yourself: ""Would they say 'yes, that's what I mean'?""
5. If not, strengthen it until they would.

**Note:** This will feel uncomfortable. That discomfort is your aperture used to looking for easy targets to attack. Stay with it.

---

# The Counterfeit Test

Here's the problem: manipulators use the language of openness. ""Be open."" ""Don't be defensive."" ""Let go of your resistance."" These can be genuine invitations to growth—or they can be crowbars to pry you open for someone else's purposes.

**How do you tell the difference?**

### The One Question

> Does this help me find what *I* resonate with?
> Or does it demand I resonate with *it*?

**Real Training:**
- Returns you to your own signal
- Strengthens your discernment
- Makes you harder to manipulate
- Welcomes your ""no""
- Doesn't need you to believe it

**Counterfeit Training:**
- Replaces your signal with theirs
- Calls your discernment ""resistance""
- Makes you dependent on the teacher
- Punishes your ""no""
- Requires your belief to work

> ⚠️ **The Deepest Counterfeit:** The manipulator says ""Stay open to what's true""—but *they* define what's true. Your resistance becomes evidence of your failure. Your accurate perception becomes ""defensiveness."" This is how lies wear the mask of openness.

Real steelman training makes you *harder* to capture, not easier. If any practice makes you more dependent on an external authority to know what's true, it's counterfeit. Walk away.

# Practice Exercises

### Exercise 2.1: The Political Steelman
Pick a political position you find abhorrent. Not one you mildly disagree with—one that triggers you.

1. Write the strawman version (the one you usually attack).
2. Write the steelman version (the version a thoughtful person would hold).
3. Notice: what did you have to acknowledge to build the steelman?
4. Ask: is your original position strengthened or weakened by this?

### Exercise 2.2: Steelman Your Opponent in Real Time
In your next disagreement (online or in person):

1. Before responding, say: ""Let me make sure I understand. The strongest version of what you're saying is [steelman]. Is that right?""
2. Wait for them to confirm or correct.
3. *Only then* respond to that version.

Notice what happens to the conversation.

### Exercise 3.1: Steelman Against Yourself
Pick a belief you hold strongly.

1. State the belief clearly.
2. Now build the strongest possible case *against* it.
3. Pretend you're a brilliant opponent who wants to destroy this belief. What would you say?
4. Sit with what you built. Does your belief survive? Does it need modification?

**Warning:** If this doesn't feel threatening, you're not doing it right. Find a belief that matters to you.

### Exercise 4.1: Contradiction Hunting
This is advanced practice. Proceed with care.

1. List 10 things you believe about yourself, relationships, or how the world works.
2. Compare them in pairs. Do any contradict each other?
3. When you find a contradiction, ask: ""Where did each belief come from?""
4. Often one will trace to experience, the other to something you were told. Which is the lie?

**Example:** ""I believe I deserve love"" + ""I believe I'm fundamentally flawed"" = contradiction. One of these was installed. Find it.

# Common Failure Modes

Steelmanning can be weaponized. Watch for these corruptions:

**Steelmanning as Performance**
""Look how fair and rational I am."" The point becomes appearing open-minded rather than actually being open to change. You steelman, then dismiss anyway. The form without the function.

**Steelmanning as Dominance**
""I understand your position better than you do."" Using steelmanning to establish intellectual superiority. This flips the practice into another power game.

**Steelmanning as Delay**
Endlessly refining the steelman to avoid ever actually responding. ""But wait, let me make sure I have your position exactly right..."" Used to escape commitment to your own view.

**Pseudo-Steelmanning**
Appearing to strengthen the opposing position while actually strawmanning it. ""So the strongest version of your view is [subtle distortion]..."" The form is there, the substance isn't.

> **The Test:** After steelmanning, are you more able to be changed by what you heard—or have you just performed openness while staying exactly where you started?

---

# Progression Markers

How do you know you're advancing? Not by how much you know—by how you *respond*.

### Level 1 Markers: Steelmanning Others
- ✓ You can state an opponent's position better than they can.
- ✓ People feel *more* heard when they disagree with you, not less.
- ✓ You notice when others are strawmanning (including media, politicians, friends).

### Level 2 Markers: Steelmanning Positions You Disagree With
- ✓ You can articulate views you ""hate"" without contempt.
- ✓ You've found something valuable in a position you previously dismissed entirely.
- ✓ Your certainty has become more nuanced (not weaker—more precise).

### Level 3 Markers: Steelmanning Against Yourself
- ✓ You can genuinely threaten your own positions.
- ✓ Changing your mind in public feels like strength, not weakness.
- ✓ You seek out challenges to your worldview instead of avoiding them.

### Level 4 Markers: Finding Subconscious Contradictions
- ✓ You've identified specific lies you internalized (and can name their source).
- ✓ Patterns you repeated unconsciously have become visible.
- ✓ Your aperture now catches dissonance before it becomes behavior.

# Community Structure

This practice is hard to sustain alone. The lie-gradient is the water we swim in. You need others who are also swimming upstream.

### Principles of Resonance Community

**Steelman Default** — All disagreement begins with steelmanning. This is the price of entry, not an advanced technique.

**Updating is Status** — The person who says ""I was wrong, here's what changed my mind"" gains respect, not loses it.

**No Capture** — No one owns the truth. No leader is above being steelmanned against. The method outranks all individuals.

**""No"" is Welcome** — Your resistance is data, not defect. If you feel pressured to agree, something is wrong.

**Resonant + Functional** — We provide both channels of love. Being with, not just doing for. Presence, not just help.

**Falsifiable Claims** — We state what would prove us wrong. Unfalsifiable claims are not welcome here.

### How Practice Works Together

- **Pairs:** Regular practice with one partner. Take turns presenting positions, steelmanning each other, challenging each other's views.
- **Small Groups:** Tackle harder topics together. Multiple perspectives strengthening and challenging.
- **Public Practice:** Demonstrate steelmanning in public forums. Model what it looks like.
- **Witness Circles:** For Level 4 work—safe spaces to name the lies you find and be seen in that naming.

---

# Fail-Safes

Every good thing gets co-opted. Every truth movement eventually gets captured by the lie-gradient. How do we prevent that?

**Fail-Safe 1: The Method Over the Leader**
No person is above being steelmanned against. The moment someone becomes un-challengeable, the gradient has flipped. If you can't question it, leave.

**Fail-Safe 2: Falsifiability Requirement**
Every core claim must state what would disprove it. ""This can't be questioned"" is the signature of the lie-gradient. We question everything—including this.

**Fail-Safe 3: The Exit Door**
Leaving is always legitimate. No guilt. No ""you're abandoning the truth."" Any community that punishes leaving has become a trap.

**Fail-Safe 4: Your ""No"" Matters**
If your resistance is consistently pathologized—""that's just your ego,"" ""you're being defensive""—the counterfeit has entered. Real training welcomes your no.

**Fail-Safe 5: Demonstrated Not Just Claimed**
We don't ask you to believe we're different. We show it. Watch how we respond to challenge. Watch how we treat dissent. Judge by action.

**Fail-Safe 6: Harder to Manipulate, Not Easier**
If this practice makes you *more* susceptible to influence, something is wrong. The test: are you more able to think for yourself, or less?

1qhdmf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1qhdmf0/keurig_k35_leaks_from_bottom_fix/,Keurig K35 leaks from bottom fix,"I've seen this problem mentioned elsewhere with recommendations of silicone grease or silicone sealant.  I present here an alternate approach that involves 6 nuts, 6 bolts, 12 washers, and likely is more effective.

I was given a K35 that didn't run, but instead sucked in water, made boiling sounds, then gave up and sat in an expanding puddle like a sad puppy.  Upon disassembly I found that where the plastic meets aluminum in the boiler had lost it's seal.  In this case the keurig had been exposed to very low temperatures and I suspect the plastic contracted more than the the aluminum, resulting in the pressure on the aluminum that warped in between the fasteners.  That, in turn, reduced the pressure on the silicone O-ring inside the boiler, so that it no longer sealed.  The warped aluminum is the root problem.

The O-ring its self was absolutely fine, and I really don't think these things degrade unless you're running gasoline or vodka through your keurig.  The hoses are made from the same material and exposed to the same hot water, so if the O-ring degrades you'd think the hoses would too.  I'm skeptical of reports of degraded O-rings for this reason.  I also don't want silicone grease or caulking inside my coffee maker - I don't care if it's food-safe or not.

Anyways, there was hard water/scale in the boiler and on the O-ring. I cleaned all this off.  Then I got down to the business of un-warping the aluminum.  I did this using a small vice and a piece of wood (see pics), working around the circular rim until it was nice and straight.  That went well and the bottom of the boiler sat perfectly flat on a desk surface when I was done.

That would probably be enough, but I didn't want this ever happening again, even if someone again left the coffee maker in the -40 degree cold.  So I drilled 6 more holes in the plastic and aluminum around the rim to double the number of fasteners (nuts and bolts) from 6 to 12.  I used a 1/8th drill bit and washers on the top and bottom reduce the risk of plastic cracking as I tightened them down. Stainless steel might have been best, and the existing screws and bolts in this machine are stainless, but I had some of these #6 yellow chromate bolts on hand so I used those.  

If you're doing this repair you can probably get the stainless nuts, bolts, and washers from Home Depot or similar for under $6.

There are a couple spots which are off-limits to new bolts - these are where the bolts would get in the way of the black plastic base of the keurig where the boiler is seated.  I aimed to put the new bolts in wherever the warping had been the worst.

With the new fasteners in place, I pressure tested the boiler (covered 3 holes with my fingers and tried to force air into the forth).  There were no leaks so I reassembled and gave 'er a go and it works.

If anyone is interested, I can provide a link to a more detailed write-up with more photos.

So, I was invited to a neighbor's house for coffee yesterday and we chatted and talked and had fun. Problem was, I didn't leave until it was dark out 🙃🙃I am so used to being told ""well, we're gonna do xyz..."" Or ""well, it's about that time..."" Or something similar but they said none of that. I wanted to leave after about 2 hours but then I started over thinking it like ""what if it's too short, what if they think I'm skrrt skrrt'ing away, Am I just supposed to stay??? how do I say I'm leaving w/o being offensive??"" So many things. I finally worked the courage to dip when she was wrangling the kids for bedtime (I don't have kids) and this morning I sent a text thanking her for inviting me over and apologizing if I overstayed my welcome and explained basically like above, I was worried about offending and got anxious.

She texted back and said she enjoyed my company as well but that the stay was quite long as she is normally busy with her kids and such. I apologized and explained again 🙃🙃 expressing I was used to being told to leave and I understood her sentiment and reasoning, apologizing once more for overstaying.

Now, I called my Mom and she helped me a little, I've always been an overthinker and worry wort so as usually leave the ball in other people's court and move accordingly but as I get older, I'm learning I have to start being more intentional and forward/initiative(?) And I'm not used to that at all. She gave me advice for the future which ultimately was ""making no choice is the worst choice, it's better to make a choice and learn from the wrong than take no action"". This made me feel better for the future but I can't stop internally cringing at everything and picking on myself. I apologized/explained myself too much, I overstayed, maybe I came on too strong (I made muffins for her family since she offered coffee but she declined keeping them🙃), maybe this maybe that, I did this I did that, blah blah blah. Idk how to get over this feeling and stop admonishing myself. And I can't help but feel I ruined this potential new friendship bcuz of my inability to say deuces🙃🙃

I know a lot of this is just bcuz it's so recent but I would like to just process my L and move on 😅😅 Do y'all have any suggestions? Pls help 😅😅

Thanks.

TL/DR: I was invited for coffee at a neighbor's house, I got too anxious to dip until nighttime, cringe is overwhelming me and I can't stop replaying every single ""mistake"" in my head. Pls help.",2,1768849979.0,blackladies,3,1.0,False

The answer is usually no.

I’ve been living a stringent financial muscle-building exercise since I moved back to the midwest, one in which my income pays for:

* Rent
* Groceries
* Dog Food
* Coffee  
* Taxes
* *Occasional* dog boarding or books or beer supplies or lunch on the go, etc.
* …and that’s about it.

Certainly I did not wake up one day and decide, “hey, I’d like to run a strict financial exercise on myself, fun!”

It’s a situation that many do our best to avoid, and by the time those of us in modern western cultures have reached my age (late 30s), would largely consider this to be a lack of success. A failure, even! 

And boy oh boy, have I been through those feelings. But never mind that for now!

There’s a certain amount of freedom I crave: more travel, picking up meals to go, buying groceries without thinking about the number, signing up for classes, not worrying about vet bills & car repairs. All of those are easier to implement with a bigger number in the bank.

Then again, I look around my home - well furnished and comfortable, even overstuffed with things - and honestly, I’m overwhelmed by the result of past freedom. In my case (renting a furnished home owned by somebody else), much of the stuff was purchased by the owners. But all the same, their financial freedom is my emotional weight.

Then I look at all my books, purchased with *my* past financial freedom. How much have I really read those books? I mean I have read most of them. But have I really soaked up everything I can from them? No, absolutely not. So that’s a great reminder to lean into what I have. And since only buy books when I'm 95% sure I'm going to read them, these books are jam-packed with information that’s really interesting to me. 

Buying stuff is often antithetical to my values. I see the way much of our stuff is produced, resulting in circumstances like ecocide, animal abuse, poor conditions for humans who create it, etc. 

Why would I buy something when I know it requires me to participate in that?? That alone that makes it pretty easy to say “no” to “Do I really need this?”

It also makes it feel really really really sweet when I decide to purchase something. 

I ordered a book yesterday. Do I need it? No, not really. Do I want it? Yes! 

My financial exercise isn’t soooo strict that I never buy anything. Rather, I am very intentional about what I buy, and how & why I’m adding it to my life.

The book in question is a beer brewing book I've had my eye on for a year or two, and has been recommended to me by other brewers. I found a used copy from a company I respect and want to support.

And now I get to savor the whole experience: There’s the sweet anticipation I get to feel for the next 4-8 business days until it arrives at my doorstep. And then I’ll crack it open on a weekend morning over a cup of coffee at one of my favorite cafes. I’ll get to have that delicious experience of devouring paragraphs of info about a topic I find endlessly interesting, and go play with my new knowledge in my kitchen. 

No matter what my financial situation is going forward, I love this way of approaching purchases and will definitely be carrying it with me.",1,1768849836.0,u_Kitchen_Brews,0,1.0,False

I don’t have any debt and I have a large savings because I recently had two family members unexpectedly pass away that caused some life changes for my entire family and, as a result, my parents were able to give me and my siblings financial gifts. 

I grew up lower middle class, probably leaning more towards poor. We went through near-foreclosure, car repossessions, I never had clothes that fit because they were all hand-me-downs, we stole neighbors WiFi for our hand-me-down laptop that was missing most of the keyboard keys, we didn’t have cable and watched the same DVDs on an old Xbox that would overheat so we’d stuff it in the freezer daily, just a lot of things that I thought were normal as a kid that were definitely not normal! I remember we went school supply shopping at Walmart once and my mom’s card declined. Since that meant there was no money, we just left the cart there and went home. Luckily, my parents are in a MUCH better place now. My dad was able to get a great job when I was a junior in high school.

Because of my childhood, the money I do have seems fake and I feel like it could go away at any point. This is probably why I keep my entire savings in an HYSA and haven’t invested it (yet). Last month, I started investing $2,000 a month from the large savings split between a Roth IRA and brokerage account. I do have my entire 401k invested in a target date fund.

I live with my boyfriend of four years (Z) who makes three times what I do so he covers a large portion of our fixed expenses. I will not be including his financial info because we do not combine finances.

# Section One: Assets and Debt 

**Retirement Balance:** \~$166,000 combined 

* **401k:** $155,142 - My first company contributed 4% + up to 6% match, so I started contributing 6% out of college (age 22). Eventually I increased my contribution to 10%. At the beginning of 2025, I started to contribute the maximum which is 22% of my salary. My current company matches up to 6%.
* **HSA:** $4,955 - I used to use HSA for all of my medical expenses. I started contributing the maximum ($165 per paycheck) at the beginning of 2025 and now pay for medical expenses out of pocket. I keep track of my medical expenses and save the receipts so I can eventually reimburse myself.
* **Roth IRA:** $5,756

**529 Balance:** $15,600

* I have two 529s, one for my sister and another for my nephew. My sister is 14 and I contribute $100 per month. My nephew is 6 months old and I contribute $25 per month and I plan to increase the contribution once my sister goes to college. My dad contributes to both periodically as well.

**Savings account balance:** $75,262

* Emergency fund: $20,000
* Investing (slowly over the next couple years): $43,000
* Travel fund: $4,262
* Medical: $2,400
* Pets: $200
* Any large purchase: $2,600
   * Things like gifts, donations, etc.
* Cruise: $2,800
   * My mom reimbursed me for a cruise we’re taking in the summer. I haven’t been charged for it yet so I set the money she gave me aside.

**Checking account balance:** $965

**Credit card debt:** None

**Student loan debt:** None

* I had 50k from two degrees - BA/MS in Economics. The loans were mostly from my BA which I used to pay tuition and most of my living expenses. I paid half of the debt off myself, and my dad paid off the rest after he received an inheritance. I legit cried when he told me he wanted to pay them off for me.

# Section Two: Income

**Income Progression:** I make $110,000 + a yearly bonus based on company performance. I started in this role out of college (at a different company) and my starting salary was $67,000. Check out my salary story here! [https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1ogslhp/salary\_story\_senior\_product\_analyst\_in\_the\_sf\_bay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1ogslhp/salary_story_senior_product_analyst_in_the_sf_bay/)

I don’t make as much in my role as I would if I worked for a company located in the Bay Area. My company is HQ’d in the midwest and I work remotely. They don’t have a geographic differential for remote workers, so I make the same as someone living in a LCOL city. I am very happy at my company and I love being remote, so I’m not going to change anything anytime soon, if ever. My partner makes \~3x what I do so that’s how I am able to live comfortably in this area. If we were to (God forbid) break up or if we had never gotten together in the first place, I wouldn’t be living here. I really don’t enjoy living with roommates and I’d probably move back to my hometown (super LCOL and rural) where I could purchase a home.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home**

$4,400 - my deductions other than taxes are 22% to 401k, $165 per paycheck to HSA, and $50 for healthcare/dental/vision.

# Section Three: Expenses

**Rent:** Our rent is $4,600 and I pay $1,530 which is about 33%. We split it proportional to our base salaries. 

**Savings contribution:** $820 

**Groceries:** $400 a month, sent to my boyfriend with what I send him for rent. We have a joint credit card for all of these items that he pays off in full every month. Groceries, toiletries, household items, etc. definitely add up to more than $800 a month but we agreed that I will send a flat payment to him each month. This is partially due to the fact that he makes more but also because I do most of the household work. I think it’s fair.

**Donations:** $35 a month to two different animal rescues, \~$500 once per year to a cat rescue, and I split $1,750 from my bonus last year among various rescues. I also volunteer at a nearby shelter once a week. If you can’t tell, I love animals. If I were to win the lottery it’s the first thing I’d spend the money on.

**Utilities:** $400 - we split this 50/50.

**Subscriptions:** $45 - YouTube Premium, Strava, and various Patreons

**Gym membership:** $120

**Monday**

* 7am - I wake up, eat a chocolate chip frozen waffle, and head out on my run. I’ve been having some hip pain lately which is really frustrating. After my run I eat breakfast and log onto work.
* 11am - After a few hours working on a project that I’ve been procrastinating, I have a bi-weekly “chat” with one of my work besties. We share tv recommendations and chat a little about work. After we hang up I go and eat lunch which is meal prepped chicken lemon farro soup (Mendocino Farms dupe!). 
* 1pm - I walk to the gym to do my strength workout. I do a lower body workout followed by an upper body workout.
* 3pm - The strength workout flared up my hip so I spend the rest of the day sad. I have run club tonight and I was going to walk, but I don’t think that’s a good idea anymore. 
* 5pm - I make dinner (sheet pan sausage and veggies with rice) while watching some vlogs on YouTube. While eating, my boyfriend and I watch a few Bright Sun Films videos (highly recommend). He has a board meeting for some volunteer work he does, so I go upstairs and put new sheets on the bed while he starts that. 
* 8pm - I start reading, which I do every night around this time. I’m currently reading the Noelle Marshall series. I love a series with a female protagonist who solves crimes. 
* 10pm - Lights out! 

**Daily total: $0**

**Tuesday** 

* 7:30am - Good morning! The semi-feral cat we recently took in is yelling at me to feed him. He’s staying in our guest room until he can see a vet and then hopefully interact with our resident kitty. After feeding him and another feral cat who lives outdoors, I make myself breakfast. While eating, I talk my friend off a ledge. His parents “cut him off” - aka pay his rent and give him $2,400 in allowance but have changed the passwords for their bank accounts. Apparently he was going in and transferring money ($1,900 in the last 6!!!! days) to himself. He's batshit crazy and I love him. I also order myself a sourdough loaf for delivery from a local bakery (**$22.76**). 
* 9am - I’ve spent the morning working on a project in a program I’ve never used before. 
* 11am - After some meetings, I remember that I need to order contacts. I didn’t realize that 1-800-Contacts allows you to use vision benefits - yay! I feel like this is a new thing...? I apply my $105 benefit and pay **$81.88** for six months of contacts.
* 12pm - My sourdough loaf got delivered! I heat up my lunch (chicken lemon soup again) and have a slice of sourdough with it. I watch Homeland while eating. 
* 12:30pm - I put in headphones and clean our bedroom. I have a daily chore list that I found on Pinterest, so today is vacuuming upstairs and cleaning the master bathroom. I HATE cleaning the bathroom. 
* 3pm - This is when I normally wrap up work unless I have time-sensitive projects due soon. Most of the people I work with are on the East Coast so I don’t need to worry about someone messaging me at this time. I sit down on the couch, turn Homeland back on, and work on a beanie I’m knitting for my dad. Z comes home from his hybrid job and immediately goes out on his run.
* 5pm - I have some pasta with sauce and spinach for dinner. Z and I start watching 11.22.63 on Netflix. He read the book in middle school, and watched the show when it originally came out on Hulu but never finished it. It’s pretty good so far!
* 8pm - I read and get ready for bed. I am so tired today.

**Daily total: $104.64**

**Wednesday**

* 7am - I get up, eat a chocolate chip eggo waffle, and head out on my run. I make it 25 minutes into the run before I decide to call it. My hip has been hurting again for about a week, and I don’t feel like I’m doing myself any favors continuing to run on it. I am so so so sad but I call my boyfriend to come pick me up and walk to the road. He takes us to get coffee and then home.
* 10am - I start working on a request from my manager for about an hour, then meet with him for our 1-1. Turns out he doesn’t need the info anymore, yay! 
* 12pm - I head downstairs and eat lunch. My running coach told me a few days ago that she had similar groin/hip pain and pelvic floor physical therapy really helped. I was a bit hesitant to do this on top of the sports PT that I’m already doing, but I decide to book a consultation for tomorrow (**$370**). I am honestly frantically trying to solve whatever is going on with my hip.
* 4pm - I log off work and sit on the couch for a while. Once Z finishes work, he joins me and we turn 11.22.63 on again. I start dinner (Korean Beef Bowls) while we watch.
* 7pm - I’m meeting with my mentee tonight! I met her years ago at a career fair and we’ve met monthly ever since. She just returned from an amazing trip so we chat about that the entire time.
* 9pm - I wind down, read, and try to relax. I get really “spun up” according to my boyfriend (lol) and we joke about how spun up I am about my physical therapy consult tomorrow. 
* 10pm - Goodnight!

**Daily total: $370**

**Thursday**

* 8am - I roll out of bed and immediately feed our new cat. Then I make myself some yogurt and granola for breakfast. Once I finish that, I make a latte and head upstairs to log onto work.
* 9:30am - Time to head to my PT appointment!
* 10am - The PT office is soooo cute. The PT goes over my medical, injury, and running history. She does an external and internal exam and tells me that while my pelvic floor is strong, it’s really tight. That’s why I have pain during sex and also when trying to insert tampons. I also have a strong core but poor core coordination. The rest of my body is trying to overcompensate for these issues, hence my hip injury. She gives me some homework and we schedule another appointment in a few weeks.
* 12pm - I have a snack and head into a work meeting. Right before, I get an email that I’ve been charged for my 10 pack of running specific PT appointments (**$2,000**). I have a hefty savings for medical/health expenses and planned for this, so I’m not worried about the cost.
* 2pm - I finally decide to send an analysis that I’ve had finished for almost a week to another manager I’ve been working with. Does anyone else get nervous before they send off a summary/“I’m finished” email?
* 3:30pm - Z and I go get a coffee once we both wrap up our work days. 
* 4pm - I do a little upper body workout and then we put 11.22.63 back on! 
* 6pm - I head upstairs to take a bath while Z makes dinner. The bath helps my hip a lot. While in the bath, I call my mom and tell her about PT this morning. She’s super interested in going herself. We talk a little about how expensive it was but both decide that it’s totally worth it since it’s for my health. 
* 8pm - I play with the new cat for a little bit. He’s getting more courageous! 
* 9pm - I should be in bed by now but I get an email that my W-2 is ready so I SPRINT to [freetaxusa.com](http://freetaxusa.com). Tax season has always been my favorite time of the year because I’ve gotten a refund since I was 16 and started working. I text my cousin and she’s so excited too. Hopefully I forever get a refund, haha! My boyfriend always owes thousands and I feel bad for him. This year I’ll get \~$1,100 back! I pay the **$15.99** for them to file my state taxes.

Daily total: **$2,015.99**

**Friday**

* 8am - Another day another kitty yelling at me for food! I feed the cats, make a latte, and follow a 10 minute pelvic floor release YouTube video. My hip pain is SO weird - it goes from my groin, to my glute/back, to the front of my hip, alllll over depending on the time of day. I eat some yogurt and granola then log on to work. I’m honestly feeling really down about my hip. I love to run and strength train and I just can’t do either right now. I feel a little lost without my favorite activities.
* 11am - I’ve been working on summarizing upcoming product changes all morning for the state I work on. It’s a really frustrating project but I power through.
* 12pm - I eat lunch then do all of my chores for the day. Today I washed my cat’s bowls, washed our towels/bath mats, and grocery shopped (online). I spent $185.56 at Safeway, including tip, but I won’t count that towards my daily or overall total since it goes on our joint CC that Z pays off each month.
* 5pm - Z went into work today and just got home. He immediately heads out to the gym while I make dinner. 
* 7pm - We’ve been watching YouTube for a while and I get super tired again and head upstairs. I was going to start getting ready for bed and read, but I realize the new kitty needs some enrichment time so I play with him for a while.
* 9pm - I read a little and then head to bed.

**Daily total: $0**

**Saturday**

* 9:30am - I wake up late today, feed all of the kitties, and then make myself a yogurt parfait and a latte for breakfast. I’m going to a workout class at my gym for the first time today and I am honestly a little anxious! I’ve been going to my gym for almost two years, and I know where everything is, but I’ve never been inside the studio where the class takes place.
* 10:20am - I leave for my workout class, which starts at 10:45am. The gym is legitimately a 3 minute drive from my house. Normally I walk, but I don’t want to push it with my hip.
* 12pm - The class was amazing! It was super low impact and not that challenging, but I got a great workout and I will be back.
* 1pm - I get home, shower, have chocolate milk then eat my lunch which is garlic bread, aka sourdough with Kerrygold garlic butter in the oven, and my lemon chicken soup. I turn on YouTube and work on a hat I’m knitting for my dad. Z is on his long bike ride, which was supposed to be done around now but he got 2 flats and ended up at the bike shop. He probably won’t be home for a few hours.
* 4pm - I decide to take a bath just as Z gets home from his ride. My hip is achey, which is so so frustrating, but I try to remind myself that healing isn’t linear. 
* 6pm - I order some Panda Express for dinner because I’ve been craving it all day. I order via Doordash (**$25.39**). Z doesn’t want any and makes himself carbonara.
* 8pm - I go upstairs to play with the new kitty and watch a new-ish scary movie called Keeper. It’s pretty creepy at first, but once I finish it, I realize it actually wasn’t that great.
* 10pm - Goodnight!

**Daily total: $25.39**

**Sunday**

* 10am - Z wakes me up and asks if I want to go to the bookstore. He watched both Dune movies last night and decided he wants to read the books. I start getting dressed as he decides which bookstore to go to. Unfortunately, they’re all closed until 12pm so he goes on his bike ride instead.
* 10:30am - I start The Pitt on HBO while making my yogurt and granola and a latte. This show is SO GOOD! I’m hooked from episode 1.
* 12:30pm - Z calls me. He crashed on his bike so I go pick him up. Luckily he has no major injuries, just some minor road rash. He ripped up his new skinsuit and I feel so bad!
* 1:30pm - After helping Z clean his wounds and chatting about how frustrating it is that he’s in pain now, I turn The Pitt back on.
* 4:30pm - I turn off the tv finally and get ready for volunteering. I head over to the animal shelter and the other girl I normally volunteer with is there today! She’s in high school and I love chatting with her. 
* 6:30pm - Z is afraid he dislocated his hip so we do some “tests” and decide we’ll see how it feels in the morning. Hip injury buddies! He made dinner (sheet pan and veggies with rice) while I was gone so we sit down and eat. We start watching The Long Walk. I order a vintage copy of Dune for him from Etsy (**$14.19**). 
* 8:30pm - The Long Walk was good! I go upstairs to play with the new kitty and he immediately has a wheezing attack so I request an appointment for him ASAP with the vet down the street. I suspect he might have kitty asthma… Good thing we have pet insurance for him!
* 10pm - I start getting ready for bed and replace Z’s bandage on his shoulder. He wants to go to sleep immediately but I still need to finish this episode of The Pitt so I head downstairs to finish up. I also realize I need new moisturizer so I order that off Amazon (**$16.34**).
* 10:30 - Goodnight!!

**How do you feel about your spending?** 

I definitely spent more on physical therapy than I would have liked to, but that is okay and I know it will make me a more resilient runner and person in the long run. I am most excited about the pelvic floor physical therapy. I have had so many symptoms of a dysfunctional pelvic floor over the past few years, but I thought they were all “normal” things that every woman dealt with. Other than the PT spending, I feel like I did well this week! I didn’t spend on much that I didn’t need.

**Was this a normal week for you?** 

This was a pretty normal week. I feel *slightly* embarrassed about the amount of time I spend at home. I am SUCH an introvert and normally I go to run club, but I couldn’t this week because of my hip. That is honestly my only social outing. I don’t really have any friends in this area even though I’ve lived here for 4 years. It’s something I think about a lot. There are so many opportunities to get social interaction but I would rather stay home. I am so much more comfortable at home and have been since I was young. I love talking to people and learning about them, but taking the step to actually make a true friend has always been hard for me. 

**Has this inspired you to make changes or has it given you a “wow I’m doing pretty good” confidence boost?** 

Other than thinking about being more social, this definitely gave me a financial confidence boost! One of my New Year’s spending goals was to buy less clothes (mostly activewear for running) and I have achieved that this week and so far this year!

So about a week ago, I met this girl F25 who lives about 30 minutes away from me. We talked for a few hours, and planned a date for Thursday. We got coffee, hungout, and had a great time. She asked about my previous dating experiences which I said that ive met either people who aren’t over their ex’s or it just didn’t workout. Just being completely honest with her. She mentioned she was in the hospital and her boyfriend of 1 year ghosted her and blocked her on everything. Which I said is terrible and told her im sorry to hear that. We continued talking about music and movies, she asked if I wanted to come over which I said yes. We hungout, watching a movie and she asked for my instagram. She followed me, just before I left. On my way home at 8pm I texted her I had an amazing time and accepted her instagram request. She responded the next day (Friday) that we should hangout again, which I agreed. We got food Friday and watched a movie, she had a Dr’s appointment at 3pm so I left. I kissed her and said we should hangout soon. 

1 day goes by, she reaches out to me at 11pm and says she wants to hangout again, so we have plans for Sunday. We grab food (ramen) and watch a movie at 5pm, she leaves work at 4:20pm. She also mentioned we should hangout Monday and do a music class, we both agreed. We texted until 1am, she said she was making music, and was gonna be up late. She didn’t respond, however, accepted my instagram request at 1am. The next morning she texted me saying we should hangout earlier, since she left work early so we agreed on 3pm. She texted me at 1:46 saying heres my address and I drove 30 minutes in a snowstorm to her house.

I arrived at 2:48 and texted her I was here early and didn’t receive a response, until 3:35 saying “Oh I just saw this” and responded to my text are you asleep? Saying “how did you know lol” and apologize she was up late. I also called her but didn’t knock on the door, she was the only one home. I left her house at 3:17 and drove home. She texted me saying shes sorry and wants to hangout later in which I said to her “best of luck to you” and ended things. She got mad and said I gave up on her so quickly and that I affected her mental health.

I have a colleague who speaks English better than many cabinet ministers. Not American English, or British English, but the very old school and atas ""Singapore English"".  He pronunces every syllabus clearly and accurately, with all the dipthongs and diagraphs intact, probably 99% close to Received Pronunciation. 

He mentioned that he probably picked up his accent from a very famous top school in Singapore, partly so as not to come across as showing off his family background, but he comes from an old-money Singapore family. I guess his parents speak like that. I genuinely enjoy hanging out with him, partly to listen to his refined English. 

Being born and raised in Malaysia (educated in Chinese school),  my English does not come as naturally as it does for Singaporeans.

But hanging out with him isn't always easy. I feel guilty when he always insists to cover expensive meals. I hesitate to suggest places to go because his standard is very high. If food quality does not meet his expectation, he won't hide his criticism. 

I rarely suggest going out for meals with him because I don't want him to foot the bill. But after our activities, he'll always suggest grabbing food or coffee, which I cannot afford. 

So I’m stuck enjoying his company, but also feeling awkward about the cost and anxious about choosing places that won’t disappoint him.",0,1768849352.0,asksg,1,0.5,False
1qhdaee,https://www.reddit.com/r/QueerPDX/comments/1qhdaee/looking_to_build_community_in_2026/,Looking to build community in 2026 :),"Hi, one of my goals for this year is to build community as I recently moved to NE Portland. I do drive as long as the destination has parking available. And sometimes take public transportation. 

I figured this is a good place to start. Feel free to comment here or DM me on Reddit if you think we’d be a good fit :)

About me:

My name is Levi. They/them are my pronouns, but honestly I’m not bothered by people using other pronouns for me. Any gendered language is cool for me. 

I’m 26. Been working in food service for the past decade. Currently a baker. In my free time, I like to paint, make DIY clothing, patches, and accessories (punk and goth). I cut and dye my own hair. I’m down to do other people’s hair if they like. 

When the weather allows, I like to go on short hikes in parks and wildlife trails that allow humans. 

Some of my other goals are to go to more shows. So if you know of local bands, please let me know. Maybe we can meet up for coffee first, then see if we’d want to go to a show together :)

Also once I have some money saved up, I’m planning to start a small online business selling DIY patches, tote bags, and maybe some T-shirts with my original art on them. Only quality shirts that are comfortable. 

I’m nicotine, alcohol, and 420-friendly. I personally don’t smoke herb because it causes me anxiety. Totally alright if that’s your thing. If you do psychedelics, totally chill. Just not something I personally see myself participating in anytime soon. Other substances, no judgement whatsoever. Just not something that I want in my life. Do what you want in your own time. Please test stuff and have other harm reduction plans for your safety <3

And lastly for now - no MAGA, no ICE, free Palestine and all nations facing hardship, BIPOC ally, I speak some Spanish (tbh it’s basic sentences for now. Not looking for a teacher, but if you want to speak in English and be patient while I’m learning), worker’s rights, healthcare, housing, and nutrition are human rights

Those are the basics. Just be a nice person who values good communication, showing up for each other, and being accountable. And I’ll match that energy full heartedly. I don’t care how old you are as long as you’re an adult because I’m 26. And want to make sure everyone is comfortable and safe 

Thank you to everyone who reads this. I’m looking for friends mainly. If you’re interested in something romantic or otherwise, I’m open to it. Respectfully I’m only interested in women and femme-centered people of any gender identity that are 25-33 years old. ",4,1768849331.0,QueerPDX,0,1.0,False
1qhdaa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qhdaa9/aita_for_divorcing_my_wife_after_she_accidentally/,"AITA for divorcing my wife after she accidentally sent me affair photos meant for her trainer, then blamed my work schedule?","My phone buzzed during my morning coffee and I saw a notification from my wife with three photos attached, except the message preview said ""can't wait to feel you inside me again"" and I knew immediately those pictures weren't meant for me.

I opened them anyway. There she was, in lingerie I'd never seen before, poses I definitely recognized from our bedroom but with a look on her face I hadn't seen in months. The timestamp said 7:43 AM. She was at her ""early yoga class.""

I screenshotted everything and forwarded it to my email. Then I just sat there staring at my scrambled eggs.

She came home an hour later in her yoga pants, hair actually wet this time, and kissed my cheek like nothing happened. I waited until she poured her protein shake.

""Nice photos,"" I said.

Her face went white. She grabbed for my phone but I pulled it away.

""Those are old! From like, our anniversary, I was just-""

""They're timestamped forty minutes ago. And you've never owned red lingerie.""

She switched tactics so fast I actually felt dizzy watching it. ""Oh my god, you're going through my phone now? You're checking my messages? This is exactly why we have problems, you don't trust me!""

""You sent them to me by accident.""

She stopped. Blinked. Then her eyes got mean in a way I'd never seen before.

""So what? So I have someone who actually appreciates me? Someone who doesn't work sixty hours a week and fall asleep during sex?""

That last part stung because it was true once, like three months ago when I had that big project. I'd apologized. We'd talked about it.

""Who is he?""

""None of your business.""

I laughed. Actually laughed. ""You just admitted to cheating and you think you get privacy about it?""

She grabbed her purse. ""I'm going to my mom's. When you're ready to have an adult conversation about our marriage, call me.""

She left. I called a lawyer instead.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about divorce, it moves slow until it doesn't. I had papers drawn up by Wednesday. Moved my stuff to my brother's place on Friday. She sent me about forty texts that week ranging from ""we can work through this"" to ""you're throwing away six years over nothing"" to ""he meant nothing, it was just physical.""

I didn't respond to any of them.

Her affair partner turned out to be her CrossFit trainer. Twenty-four years old, lived in his mom's basement, had a girlfriend. I know because his girlfriend called me two weeks later after finding my wife's number in his phone. We had a very educational conversation. She dumped him immediately.

My wife started love-bombing me after that. Flowers to my office. Long emails about how she'd ""made a mistake"" and ""wasn't thinking clearly"" and ""we could go to counseling."" She showed up at my brother's place twice before I told her I'd file a restraining order if she didn't stop.

The thing that really got her was when I started dating again. Nothing serious, just a few coffee dates through an app. Someone saw us and told her, I guess, because I got a voice message of her absolutely losing it. Screaming about how I didn't love her, how I'd already replaced her, how I was the one who gave up on us.

I saved that message too. My lawyer loved it.

We're supposed to sign the final papers next month. She's been texting me again, asking if we can ""talk one last time"" and ""get closure."" She sent me a whole paragraph yesterday about how the affair only happened because I ""emotionally abandoned"" her and if I'd just paid more attention, none of this would've happened.

I blocked her number after that.

Her mom called me this morning. Said my wife's been a mess, barely eating, crying all the time. Said I should remember that marriage is about forgiveness and that ""everyone makes mistakes.""

I asked if she'd feel that way if her husband sent dick pics to his girlfriend by accident. She hung up.

The trainer lost his job after his gym found out he was sleeping with married clients. My wife's moved back in with her parents. I'm closing on a condo next week, got a promotion at work, and I've actually been sleeping better than I have in years.

But her family keeps saying I'm being cruel. That I should at least hear her out. That she's ""clearly sorry"" and ""going through something.""

AITA for not giving her another chance when she's obviously struggling?

I’ve been 3D printing for a while, and one thing that has bothered me is how many great older board games lack decent storage solutions, or the inserts were never good to begin with. So I started designing my own.

Lately, I’ve been uploading inserts pretty consistently (almost daily when I’m in a groove), mostly focused on:

* Older or overlooked games
* Practical, no-fluff designs
* Faster setup/teardown
* Low material usage and easy prints

I also try to keep pricing very flexible. I honestly think of it more as a “buy me a coffee” tip than a hard purchase price. The goal is to share useful designs, not locking anything behind a paywall.

I saw them post this on their IG a few weeks ago and they had a limited run of it. You can’t buy it on their site anymore but you can grab it from their shops still. I needed to grab another of this bag because it was so damn good.

I never had a China coffee before so I was curious as to how this was going to be. I let my first one degass for two weeks before diving in and after the first cup I was taken aback. It is a pretty clean natural while still having some “loudness” to it. 

On the front it has a nice tartness to it and it evolves to a nice long sweet finish on the back. When brewing with my origami I would get some perfume finish which was subtle and pleasant. When brewing in my column it was a lot more creamy and textured.

We weren't seen by very many people, but the people we did see didn’t seem to want to acknowledge us. Perhaps they were new as well, who knows. We were able to speak with the priest for a few minutes and he was very warm and welcoming. As we parted he told us that if we took away one thing, beyond all the images and incense and traditions, that Orthodoxy was a conversion to Christ. I liked that. I’m going to look into that.

War with my Body

Having a normal relationship with food seems so foreign to me, it has been that long. I can barely remember the last time I was “normal”. I can barely wrap my head around the fact that there was a point in my life that I wasn’t constantly at war with my body. Months and years of constantly being aware, always monitoring, and meticulously restricting. And sometimes, inevitably, giving into the cravings, succumbing into temptation and submitting. Either spiraling or starting to take some steps towards healing. However, every time I end up back to the beginning. The cycle starts again, but it never has truly stopped. 

I try to think about the specific thing that sparked this obsession. I can pinpoint the time when the thought first came to mind, but I don’t know where it came from. Did I simply out of nowhere one day wake up in the morning and said to myself, “You know what? Let’s start an eating disorder which will eventually take over my life for the next six years”. That was never my intention, at least not consciously. My teenage self couldn’t have fathomed that randomly deciding to skip breakfast and just eating a snack for lunch would avalanche into a commitment of self-torture.  

I could blame it on the pandemic which happened to be the time when I first took a sip of this poison. I was seventeen in the spring semester of junior year of high school. I have been playing field hockey for now a decade and was planning on continuing that career in college (spoilers: it was cut short by the pure amount of depression, anxiety, and emotional abuse that it caused but that is completely unrelated to this other “quirk” of mine”). Maybe the inner turmoil of my friend group could have played into it, but I highly doubt it. No, I think small signs were always there. I would compare myself to my friends. Maybe the racial isolation? I have always been the non-white person in nearly every space of my life, including my friends. But what young girl doesn’t compare herself to her friends? Isn’t that just part of the wonderfully stupid girlhood all women experience? I would look at them, their bodies in comparison to mine. I never thought of myself as skinny, and I fear I will never be “skinny enough” or at least to myself. I never loved the way my body looked. Yes, there was a time in my youth that I never really thought much about it, but I still don’t think I ever loved it. What woman can say that they ever had? Right? Right? Wrong. 

So yes, I’ll say it straight up. Back in 2021, me deciding to skip breakfast and just have one of those fucking snack mixes with cheese and nuts for lunch was me trying to become skinnier. Not for purely the sake of it, but for me to feel better about myself. For me to feel more comfortable in my skin. For me to hate my body a little less as terrible as it sounds. I thought “Hey, if I just lose a little weight, just a few pounds, that would be good. I’d be happy”. Wrong. Wrong again. 

The sad thing is that even at the very beginning of this journey of self-hatred and self-bodily harm, that was much better than where I am right now. I was still, well, eating. The ironic thing is, it was from my eating disorder where my interest in cooking was born. The food that I was eating needed to be “healthy” or meet my self-fabricated criteria of what that means. Now, I rarely cook. Why? Because I barely eat anymore. It’s sad because I really do enjoy cooking, but cooking would involve eventually eating. And that is something that I’ve been trying to avoid as much as possible. 

Not really eating entirely is a more recent behavior. I have been pretty up and down in regards to the “intensity” of my eating habits. I started out not eating at all during the day until dinner. But there was a time when I would still eat a sweet treat at night. Then in college, I started to eat a “lunch” again. I saw that as my “recovery” even though that lunch would only consist of a smoothie and a muffin. But hey, progress is progress, and I genuinely saw it as that.

I would eat a bigger dinner at night which would be okay because of my day fasting. Oh yes, did I fail to mention? Very guilty of the nightly binge. I mean, if you starve yourself while the sun is out, who can blame you. Oh, one more! How could I almost forget that on top of the food obsession I also became addicted to exercise. My Fitbit and I have been the best of friends. Minimum workout length is one hour. I not only track my food intake (or lack thereof) but also the number of calories that I burn during the day. My total calories burned during the day has to be significantly more than the amount going in. Math. Math to be skinnier. Yes, I felt the side-effects of undereating and overexercising. But what is a little dizziness, regular fatigue, and pure lack of mental motivation? Nothing that I can’t handle. The sickest thing is, I started to enjoy it. I saw these symptoms as evidence that my plan is working. 

Back to “road to recovery” early in college. I thought I could see the light in the tunnel, a path towards some normalcy. I started to also weight train more instead of just doing cardio. I was beginning to feel stronger, and I liked that feeling. However, when I came back home that winter break, my mom pointed out my weight gain. I did notice a change, but I didn’t think it was that extreme until my mom brought it up. I was trying on a pair of jeans and showed them to my mom. She looked at me and said, “I think your figure would look better if you lost some.” She then went on about the famed Freshman Fifteen and how she was guilty of it too. “Oh, I was the biggest I’ve ever been back then”. She saw this as an opportunity for us both to “get on it”. That was the end of my sad recovery. 

Another I guess “milestone” in my ED was when I spent a semester abroad. I have been accustomed to my new normal: not eating during the day until dinner and no sweet treats. I would have one coffee or tea in the morning and another in the middle of the day to survive. However, traveling in Europe is a unique opportunity. I gave myself permission to indulge in foods that I had previously forbade myself from having. Like pizza, pasta, other carb heavy things, and desserts. I was eating more than I would feel comfortable with but sought comfort by telling myself that this was only a temporary pleasure. I would reset once I got back home. As whimsical and lovely as this break from the real world was, it was here when I opened yet another Pandora’s box. 

Back in high school, I did attempt to make myself throw up. I hated the idea of using my finger, so I used a toothbrush. No success. I moved on. However, once more, out of pure fucked up fabrication of my mind, when I was abroad, I decided to try again. Apparently, a chopstick works wonders that a toothbrush could not with my gag reflex. Also, ironic. It wasn’t every day. I would only use it as an emergency effort. For when I ate too much. A fail safe, but a fail safe that I would use more like a crutch that I took back with me to the States. 

Obviously, I don’t enjoy spilling my guts out. It is disgusting. It is messy. It’s not ideal, but I get comfort from knowing that if I break, I could reverse the effects. Eliminate the consequences. Like it never happened. As much as I hate my body, I know it pretty well. I know the rhythm of how to be the most effective. A girl just needs three things. Something to spark the plug; something to help an easy exit; and something to keep your hair back. No, I really do hate the way it makes me feel. Lurching my body into the toilet. Tears from choking running down my face. Staring face to face with the contents. But I always keep going. Until I nearly finished it all. Until only salvia and blood comes out. 

I hate the process, and bodily trauma involved. Yet, I’m compulsive to it. Knowing that I can take it all back. Knowing that I can control. Because honestly, isn’t that what all of this is about? Control? Control. Control. Control. And I enjoy it as fucked up as it sounds. I revel in the pain. I just can’t help myself. I’m addicted. I hate hating myself, and the way it makes me feel. At the same time, I don’t think I can stop. And, I don’t really want to. Six years. That is insane. It’s hard to believe that there was a before being this far into it. I have fantasized about getting out. Sometimes I think I will. But whenever I take a step towards that dream, reality hits me like a rock. I retreat. I punish. Deep down, I don’t see me ever having the courage to end it once and for all. Speaking honestly, I don’t think normalcy is possible for me. Even if I were to take on better habits, the mindset, the thoughts will always remain like scars in my brain.

I don't know where the ""crybaby"" stereotype came from because you guys are NOT this. I'm a crybaby Leo with Pisces Moon, so I'm an expert. 🤣 You guys are SCARY. I have witnessed Cancers tear someone apart with ease on many occasions. No remorse. Cold as ice. THE POSSESSIVE STREAK TOO!

A friend of my Cancer sister used her coffee pot once to make coffee for himself, and she's still mad about it to this day. Granted, he asked permission and she said yes, but she was like, ""THERE'S A COFFEE SHOP LESS THAN A MILE AWAY. WHY DIDN'T HE PICK UP COFFEE THERE?"" 🤣

On the flip side, you guys are excellent, nurturing leaders. I work in Healthcare, so of course, I see MANY Cancers across the board. Wonderful people.

I’m trimming down the collection and these are up for grabs! Feel free to ask any questions, thank you! Payment through PayPal, prices include shipping in CONUS. I have 40 swaps and plenty of vouches on knifeswap. I switched back to Japanese knives as my hobby and I’ll start posting here more frequently.

Hitohira FG 240 mm gyuto- $275 (now $255)

Purchased from Bernal Cutlery with the saya for $310. It’s been used once. I wanted to try Hitohira and I understand why these are respected. Here’s the information from Bernal, they can describe it better than me.

Hand ground VG10 mono steel with a nice taper and convex hamaguri grind. This fine grind makes for smooth cutting and excellent food release with a long edge life and excellent stainless property. The heat treatment on this VG10 is one of the better ones we have come across with much nicer edge formation, sharpenability and toughness.

Excellent quality grinding and finish on these, possibly some of the best in their price range. We have sharpened these for many years and can say with full confidence it rivals much more expensive prestigious Japanese monosteel brands.

Masakage Shimo 240mm gyuto with White #2- $225 (now $205)

Purchased from CKTG for $290. This was my main knife for a while and it’s been used. The damascus takes a beautiful patina, I’ll also offer to coffee patina the blade on request if you desire a less reactive knife. This version was ground when Kurosaki was working with his brother and the grind is better than the Shimos available today.

Hatsukokoro Aogami Super Hayabusa 150mm Petty- $120 (now $110)

Purchased from District Cutlery for $160. I used it three times and added a coffee patina to the core steel. It’s a phenomenal laser petty for intricate garnishes and trimming. The right side of the blade has a blemish from a sponge that’s only visible at a certain angle.

J.A. Henckles 108-12 Carbon Steel Bunka- $80 (now $70)

This was handed down to me as a project. The blade was originally a 12 inch length and I added a K-tip to make it a bunka for poultry prep. It sounds weird but works very well. This knife was forged over a 100 years ago. I don’t process birds as frequently as I used to and wanted to see if a vintage collector would appreciate it more than the knife sitting in a roll.",2,1768848386.0,TrueChefKnivesBST,0,1.0,False

\- 1 lightweight knit or crewneck - for evenings or overly aggressive AC

\- 1 pair straight-leg jeans - default option, works with everything

\- 1 pair tapered chinos - slightly cleaner look for dinner without feeling dressy

\- 1 “nice” shoe (simple leather sneaker or low-profile boot) - covers most situations

\- 1 casual shoe (beat-up sneaker) - for long walks and anything messy

\- 1 belt + socks/underwear for the days

She came over for the meet and greet and it lasted over an hour. She clearly enjoys talking so didn't think too much of it but usually my meet and greets are 15-30 mins. 

She then said she wants to book her dog in beforehand to get used to me. Also fine and he stayed over for 24 hours. When she dropped him off she asked to sit down as she has MS and then she stayed for over an hour talking to me. I said I have a chronic health condition too (big mistake).

She then said she'd like to go for a walk or grab coffee with me, outside of Rover. In person I was politely agreeing but declined via text and asked to keep things to Rover. So she booked in with me once a week for the next 3 weeks. We have completed one of those bookings and again she has stayed an hour talking to me about my health. She's also given me a notebook and started sending me links for meditation, asked for my email to send me a seminar, has been researching my health condition. I've politely declined and am trying to be polite as she's my client, but I have a feeling that she is going to continue to push my boundaries, which I already know I really struggle with in general.

I have a confirmed booking with her this week, next week and the 11 day one in March and I don't feel comfortable having contact with her anymore. This is too much for me on top of my health, and crossed the line of being worth the income now.

Part 3: Sandice.

Sandice was as ornamental as it was quaint. The town, compared to other “sister-fucking towns.” to quote Zadok, was far more manicured. Sandice was held together by the grit and mutual duty to care and service of its residence. The town was barely that, it was a village frozen in time repainted every decade to suit current taste. Though this reskinning, this adaptation, seemed to have stalled out around the era the disappearances began. Tastes would rather freeze than proceed beyond distaste I suppose.

The village was organized in dense half-rings radiating out from the snare-drum heartbeat chapel that sounded solemnly with organ music each hour for 3 minutes. Homes built to last a century, a century and a half ago buddied up, not even enough room to walk between them. 

The inner tiers were shops, one of a kind each, and official structures that were clearly the middle child in terms of care received. One daycare with three teachers for five subjects, one police station that harbored only one on duty officer who passionately ingested a donut, and a lone post office with a tidy man propped up inside. 

I eyed my artistic effort on Zadok, the makeup just ever so faintly off tint with his pale caramel skin. “Can I help you, friends?” An unbalanced man asked, his hair draping into his eyes as he restrained a small mutt. 

“Yes sir, you very well may: Do you happen to know by which a wandering belly may find something good to eat?” Zadok charmed, the man’s distance fading as he gave into the dog’s demands. It passed Zadok and scampered to my feet where it nuzzled its head then spun into a bundle. 

“Ha… she’s never done that… goofy mutt– Uh yeah, yeah, food. Mondo’s is where I get lunch most days, good fries and burgers– diner food.” He shrugged.

“Wonderful. What’s your name, sir?”

“Thomas.”

“And the lady?”

“Rosie.”

“Nice to meet you both. You wouldn’t happen to be Thomas of the famous Thomas Hardware, would you?” Zadok gestured up the gravel road to the brown, 2 story square.

“No, that’s my old man’s. I just do the books there.”

“You do the books for some of the other shops too.” I commented, squatting down to pet Rosie.

“Yeah I do– how did you know that?”

“Small town, most of the time only a few people do all the accounting, especially when there’s no franchise locations.” Zadok explained.

“Huh… Detectives?”

“Guilty!” Zadok laughed and the man joined in halfheartedly.

“You’re here about Daisy.”

“Well first we came for the Thomas Hardware, but that certainly kept us here.” Zadok joked again and the man joined in in full force.

“Well if you guys need anything, I’m happy to help.”

“Well sir, if you don’t mind we’d like to take you up on that offer.”

“Not at all. What do you need?”

\*\*\*

“So, I can’t exactly search that far back.” Zadok and I leered over Thomas’s shoulders, spying on the monitor in the rear of the store, scrolling through purchase records.

“That’s fine. Can you filter the search?” Zadok had been reduced down to his vest and dress shirt, clipping off 3 buttons and patting his head down with his handkerchief. 

“Yeah, yeah.”

“Search for recent purchases of utility blades–”

“Box cutters.”

“What?” Zadok turned to me and I pulled him aside.

“He doesn't take trophies, once a kill is done so is the weapon. Daisy’s throat was slit cleanly, that knife was fresh.”

“Or maybe just the blade was, ditching the whole knife each time only increases his chances at getting caught.”

“But he doesn’t think he can be caught. Think about it, if he was so careful, he would have made absolutely sure she had zero opportunities to run, but he didn’t. He’s complacent.”

“One slip up in 40 years isn’t enough for that kind of assumption.”

“But two is. He didn’t find Ruth, she was a witness, for all he knew she saw everything, but instead of searching that house top to bottom, he looked once then left. He’s not playing smart, he’s playing hungry.” Zadok pondered for a moment, his sole thrumming thoughtfully. 

“Okay. Box cutters, from now to as far back as you can go.” We returned over Thomas’s shoulders.

“Alright… 212 sales in the past 3 years. That’s a lot more than I thought.”

“Whose purchased the most?” Zadok asked.

“Um, highest purchasers… Mitch Guian, 44, Gregory Schmit, 41, and Andrew Hearth, 38.” Thomas aimed his weak eyes through the lens of his glasses.

“It’s a start, doesn’t account for cash payments.”

“You’re right. Thomas, who works the register here?” I asked.

“Some high school kids, we rotate each season.”

“I need you to tell them to print a copy of every receipt for cash payments, and inform the customer they’re doing so.”

“Um… sure– but can I ask why?”

“I don’t actually care about saving the receipts, but if The Bear Man is purchasing with cash, it's because he doesn’t want to leave a trail, so if the cashier mentions that they’re taking copies of receipts, he’s either gonna refuse or at least make a fuss.” I explained to Thomas’s puzzled pill-shaped face.

“Alright.” He sighed.

“Thank you for all your help, Thomas. We greatly appreciate it.” Zadok removed a wad of hundreds from his pocket and thumbed out a few.

“Oh no, no, I don't want any money. I appreciate it, but you keep it.”

“Oh are you sure?” Thomas nodded. “Alrigh–”

“But– if you’re open to it, would you want to get dinner with me?” Thomas looked as if he was shrinking into himself.

Zadok looked up to me, zeroing in on my expression. “I’ll have to message Bobbie first, but yeah.”

“Bobbie?”

“My girlfriend.”

“Oh…” Zadok didn’t hear Thomas’s disappointment, turning away to message Bobbie. I spun Thomas towards me, crouching down to reach his eye level.

“He’s currently asking his girlfriend for permission to go to dinner with you, but also to possibly sleep with you.” 

“Oh! Oh, oh okay. Thank you?” He pushed the words out cautiously.

“Let me phrase that better, I have trouble wording these things: He and his girlfriend have a non-monogamous relationship but must confirm with each other that they’re okay with it– I don’t understand why granted permission is conditional, frankly the rules of it annoy me and I’d prefer they have a manual to clearly set parameters, which I’ve offered to make many times. Have I explained this in a way that confuses or concerns you?”

“Extremely both, but I’m gathering it.”

“Would you like me to try again?”

“No, I’m good. But thank you.”

“You're welcome. Have a good night. I’m leaving now. Bye.”

\*\*\*

For the first time in a good many years I was alone on a case. Zadok had double and triple checked with me to make sure I was alright with his absence, to which I assured him there wouldn't be a repeat of Marrowridge, “I have a gun this time and my bench PR has doubled.”

The township had allowed me and Zadok to stay in one of the empty houses on the outskirts of town in the meanwhile our case was ongoing. Of the options I nearly leapt from my own skin as they presented the quiet house of the missing Ruth Klerk, prior tenant: Amelia Klerk. “Make it known this is where I’m staying; that the citizens may visit me at any time between 8 AM and 10 PM with whatever information or questions they think pertinent.” The Si-Te-Cah of Lovelock cave were slain by the Paiute tribe of the Great Basin. These inhumanly tall, cannibalistic giants were the inbred offspring of Nephilim that nested in the cave for hundreds of years. One day, they ate the wrong person and the chief raised an army of the tribes strongest to kill them.

The cave had every tactical advantage over the Paiute people so instead of fighting them on their terms, the Paiute forced the giant out of their advantage. In the night they snuck to the mouth of Lovelock and set fires; huge roaring miasmas of dry brush that they hurled inside to smoke out the beast. As they ran out, lumbering and wheezing and blind, they skewed themselves on spears held high by the bravest Paiute.

Most never saw it coming, just died blind. The few that did see, only did long enough to realize their fate and be riddled with arrows. I don’t sleep, but no one else knows that– pardon Zadok and Hunter and now you– so if a hungry Si-Te-Cah, feeling his territory encroached upon, wished to come eat me in the night, he’d be rather resentful of the spears and arrows awaiting him.

The domain was sickly, gaunt by lonesome months and years away from resident hands. The townspeople had cleaned the house regularly, leaving it on the market for any prospective buyers. Their work wasn’t up to par with the Erasers I had on speed dial, but managed to work out the stench of terror that is often soaked into rugs and wood. 

The walls were plastered with patterned yellow wallpaper that shifted hue to green and red throughout the house, the patterns changing with it. It had a single story to tell, and 3 bedrooms to orate. I roomed my luggage in the master bedroom, the quilts the same as those that lingered in photographs taken in the hunt for Amelia. If you had told me this house had been ripped from time in the mid-80s, stripped of progression; frozen in ephemeral time, I’d sooner argue late-80s than argue the metaphysics. My holsters ached, the polished leather anxious for what giants may come, and if a total of 16 .45 would be enough. 

I took to the kitchen. I had ransacked the grocer, nearly a thousand dollars worth of meat, soup, rice, potatoes, bread, and more meat. The gas stove hissed and ignited, the sink bulged as dishes flowed in, and plates were overrun. When all was said and done I had a candle lit feast of four steaks, three chicken breasts, five fried chicken drums, two baked potatoes, a gallon pot half full of chicken noodle, and two loaves of bread, with coffee to wash it down. Zadok would have made me eat more, “Ain’t sleep in 29 years, the only reason you're not dead is because you eat, so eat kiddo.” but I already had enough dishes to wash so I only ate around half my standard. 

It was around three in the morning when I finished the dishes, the process was as meticulous and time consuming as cooking it all. The gravel snake that gave the impression of a road, was neglected of light, only faintly graced by the dim lights the breach from sleeping houses. Someone was out there. I could feel it. There’s a thousand and one evolutionarily significant reasons humans possess the enigmatic ghost acknowledged as intuition, but I, as do most students of knowledge, have my own theory. All the way back then, before we walked on two feet or threw sticks, there existed a predator just like us. Hairy and apish but identifiably humanoid. They walked amongst us, wandering into our dens with us none the wiser till we were already dead. Those that noticed the flaws, the minute yet innumerable errors, lived and replicated. But evolution is a two-way street; everything evolves against each other, so this predator evolved too. It grew with us, less hair, bigger eyes, bipedal, eyelashes, they kept mimicking us to eat us. At one point or another we killed them all, but the instinct remains; that perception of the imperceptible to defend us from the uncanny of our own breed. Defend us from the hungry few that walk among us. 

One such hungry spirit was about, walking around the grounds, stalking, waiting to pounce. I had the layout of the home memorized and walked through it in the dark, thinking and waiting and listening. 4 AM.

I was watching him. The impression of him. Whether or not I was staring directly at him didn’t matter, he was there, he was the forest, he was a bear… “Hibernation? What is so special about this time of year that you need to feed?”

“It’s the fall, the fall–  I need food before I rest– delicious.” I spoke to myself in the dark as I watched the forest. My eyes wandered around trees until pausing on a flyer, wind whipped against the barky hull. It hung there, longer than it should have. I walked outside, frigid air cawing at me as I marched to the tree line to behold the orange paper. The ink was smeared but legible: Visit the Fall Market: Food, Games, Juice, and of course. Fun. “I need them to enjoy my work. You sick fuck.” I held the paper tight. 

I heard him. His breath intertwined with the wind, but no ghost escapes me. I turned to him, his head poked sharply from behind a tree. The wind churned up into a gale, snatching my tie, pulling away like a noose tightening around my neck. “Boo.” I whispered. I didn’t chase him, and he didn’t run. He fled at a steady pace, routinely checking his tail to see if I had changed my mind. I think he understood intuition as I did. I think he understood and even agreed with my theory. I think his intuition told him what I was. A hungry few amongst you.

\*\*\*

“Enjoy your night?” 

“I was just about to ask the same, Charlie. Yes, my night was fabulous. We had a divine dinner, truly, I'm going to take you after we are done here. It was something to die for, best crab I’ve ever tasted. Oh and he was an absolute sweetheart, scared himself with his shadow twice, but made for wonderful conversation. Saucier details I’ll save for Bobbie.” 

“Thank god.” He chuckled manically and held his hands up as if to say: “This big.” to which I cringed away. “Ew.” I chuffed. 

“You ought to get used to those types of things, you’re gonna have a partner someday.”

“I don’t have the time nor the care to get time. I’m going to work till I’m dead and that won’t stop me for long. I’m not the relationship type.”

“You’re gonna find a gorgeous six foot girl who's into Sherlock Holmes and Warhammer, and just as OCD as you.” 

“Not only do I doubt it, even if such a specimen existed, I’d still not be interested.”

“Oh jeez, we got a stone cold badass over here.” He giggled, as he fixed me and him a cup of coffee.

“Bite me fancy pants.”

“All my pants are profoundly fancy, you know this. How was your night?”

“Insightful.” 

“You canvas the house?”

“Not in any detail, I wanted to wait for you. But…” I retrieved the folded flyer from my pocket and exchanged it for my cup of coffee. 

“Fall Market?” His gears turned and the dots connected swiftly. “The disappearances spike because he’s making extra stock.”

“Whoever this is, he’s a seller at the market, likely a popular one too with how many he takes.”

“Well we have the list from Thomas's, now with this and Daisy’s description, how hard could it be?”

“Been asking myself the same. Then again, with how smooth everything has been going I’m sure we’re owed a disaster or two.”

“Gotta love this job, just when you think a case is easy as pie, you get hit with a Marrowridge.”

“‘Be not afraid.’ What a nightmare.” 

“I thank God everyday we made it out of that shit pit alive– fuck, that we made it out sane.”

“I saw him. Out in the backyard.”

“What?!” Zadok sprang from his chair.

“He was monitoring the house for a couple hours. I went out to grab the poster and saw him… just standing there. Probably should’a shot him, but… didn’t feel real enough.”

“You promised this wouldn’t be a repeat–”

“I know what I said, you know I don’t break promises. He’s angry.”

“Why?” Zadok rests his head against the wall, enthralled by the thoughts of what The Bear Man could possibly be selling.

“Because he’s scared. He realized he wasn’t the biggest fish anymore. If it was bad when we arrived, it’s about to get worse. He’s got a reputation to uphold; to rub in our faces.”",1,1768848212.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qhcpf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1qhcpf3/new_bambino_too_cold_watery/,New Bambino too cold & watery,"Hi,  I have a brand new Bambino, and I'm about to send it back.  Here are my symptoms:

* Watery, cold ""espresso"" when pulled with the enclosed 2-spout portafilter (I don't have a bottomless one in this size).
   * This is with weighed 18g of pre-ground espresso from Peets.
* Even with (presumably)  correctly ground espresso, the shot show symptoms of under-extraction: wet puck, but extraction starts around 7 seconds, so no too much quicker than correct extraction.  I never get the creamy, honey-like flow you should get.

My perception is also that the shots are significantly colder than my previous el cheapo ($84!) DeLonghi machine.  So I decided to measure it quantitatively.

For both machines, I:

* Turned the machine on and waited 5 minutes for things to warm up.
* Pulled 2 blank double shots through an empty portafilter
* Pulled a third double shot through an empty portafilter, and measured water temperatures with an instant-read thermometer.  The cup had been pretty well preheated by the previous blank shots.

Results:

* Bambino:  160-165F
* DeLonghi: 180-185F

I think this is unacceptable, and like I said I am about to send it back (Amazon).  What I am not sure is whether to try another one … I really like the compact form factor of the Bambino, and do not need a machine with a built in grinder, but I have found other reports of too cold coffee from the Bambino.

So, I'd like some feedback -- anybody else seen this or is there anything else I should try?

Don’t have loads of dating experience, but I get matches these days, and tend to at least know when things will progress and when they won’t.

I matched a woman (25F) on Hinge last month. We’ve done around one date a week since we matched - first date was a pretty standard meet up at a pub, second was more of a night out that finished at her flat, third was a coffee date in my neighbourhood, fourth was dinner in my neighbourhood then going back to my flat. We’ve not had sex but have gone to “second base” (her profile mentioned wanting to take it slow, I’m respecting that). We get on really well and the physical attraction is definitely there, but I’ve got Asperger’s/Autism so sometimes find these things tough to parse.

Last date was on Thursday. We ended it on a pretty high note, but since then I’ve not heard anything from her which is pretty odd. I know she was going on a mini trip this weekend but got back today. It’s perfectly natural not to check your phone much when you’re away - I do the same, but you’d have thought someone would check in or whatever at least once. I sent her a text on Saturday night while I was out (nothing serious, just something random to show I was thinking of her).

Am I weird for thinking the radio silence is odd? It’d be one thing if the momentum felt like it was slowing down, but that wasn’t the vibe I was getting when we last saw each other. I dunno, maybe I’m just being anxious.",4,1768848040.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1qhckag,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhckag,Mr. Mondro / Apex Primals 🎭 🌌,"🎭 🌌 Mr. Mondro Ordonez — The Mystical Clown Host of the Apex World

Full Name: Mondro Ordonez

Preferred Name: Mr. Mondro

Age: 30

Birthday: November 20, 1995

Race: Elf Tribe / American

Alignment: Antagonist / Villain

Role: The Mystical Clown Host of the Apex World, and the Leader of the Jun-Yoon-Go Crew

Residence: Dragon Goul City (Apex World)

🤡 Personality:

Mr. Mondro loves entertaining more than anything. He laughs constantly, even when things get serious, and he treats nearly everything like it’s part of a performance. He is flamboyant, talkative, chaotic, and extremely wise, with a very high Battle IQ. When he is in his male or female human form, he enjoys toying with others, almost like it’s a game, because to him, life itself is entertainment.

He has a scrappy voice, and he is very good at manipulating people. He loves mind-controlling others to join his circus show, especially when he senses someone has talent, balanced abilities, or power that could be “entertaining” to the crowd. However, if someone tries to ruin his plans, he becomes extremely cruel, evil, and ruthless.

Even with how insane he can be, he still has strange sides to him. He enjoys sitting outside of his circus to relax and breathe fresh air in the city. He is weirdly “nice” to children in his own unsettling way, and while he doesn’t admire other villains easily, he will respect them if they prove their worth.

One of the scariest things about him is that his eyes always look like they’re smiling, no matter what emotion he is feeling. Angry, sad, happy, tired, shocked, or mad… his expression keeps that same eerie smile.

Weakness: Stronger universal abilities, and steel-based abilities.

🍔 Food & Drinks:

Water, coffee, Sprite, salad, macaroni and cheese, hamburger, fried fish, fries, spaghetti, croissant, green beans, biscuit, Cosmic Cake (Birthday), pancakes, grapes, blueberries, strawberries, rice, yaki udon, boiled eggs, corn casserole, BBQ ribs, and cheesy garlic bread.

🌌 Powers & Abilities:

Ultra Boodoo-Rudioz Form: (Special Move)

Mr. Mondro transforms into his demonic Ultra Boodoo-Rudioz Form, standing at around 7 feet tall, gaining powerful demonic energy and brutal attacks. In this form, his personality becomes fully destructive, fueled by fear, chaos, and pure evil. He still laughs at his opponents while they fall, and his abilities can overwhelm even stronger enemies.

Dark Fear Sight: He locks eyes with a target and forces fear into their mind, often showing them something or someone they never want to lose. The fear can become so strong that it doesn’t go away easily, even if the opponent attacks him. He absorbs those negative thoughts and becomes stronger. The best way to resist it is to avoid his eyes, and not mentally fall into fear.

Dark Claws Yun-Eigio: He slashes at light-speed with dark claws, cutting everywhere so fast it’s hard to escape. If struck, it can instantly crush the opponent’s defense, speed, and attack power.

Eye Stop: His stare can lock onto an opponent’s power or ability, forcing it to stop moving and crushing it. This can even cancel, erase, or shut down abilities.

Unlimited Regeneration: His regeneration is limitless, and he can even grow stronger when hit by fire, water, or psychic attacks. However, in this form, he is weak to steel and light abilities.

Body Bounce Back: Even if reality or logic is broken against him, he can “bounce back,” reflect power, and strike back with force. His body can reflect attacks created outside the world itself. This reflection effect lasts 10 minutes.

Body Extends: (Special Move)

Mr. Mondro can extend his body parts, such as his legs, neck, arms, and hands, to insane lengths that can go endlessly. This ability gives him multiple attack styles:

Huge Hand Trapping Wave: He stretches his hands into massive sizes, trapping opponents and smashing them with waves strong enough to cause extreme pain and structural damage.

Mega Fist Destruction: He enlarges his fists and smashes opponents at infinite speed, breaking through regeneration and healing abilities. This can even lead to instant KO.

Hands Yo-Yo Torture: He summons millions of hands from his own hands, grabbing opponents and shredding them with sharp nails. Since these hands are part of his body, he still feels pain when they are attacked.

Spinning Extending Body: He makes his body stretchy and spins into a tornado-like strike. Attacks that hit him are reflected back with reverse force, making it nearly impossible to hit him directly. He can lose a lot of energy using this.

Legs Extend Re-Bounce: He drops low, extends his legs, and launches at ridiculous speed, even hitting targets from any distance. This makes him nearly untouchable, since he can dodge attacks endlessly. The only way to slow it down is for the enemy to dodge every single one of his strikes until he tires out.

Body Extend Absorb: While his body is extended, he can absorb hits to boost himself. Water boosts speed, electric/fire boosts power, and ground boosts defense, but his speed can also drop depending on what he absorbs.

Hand Erase: (Special Move)

He can erase attacks or abilities completely, even if they aren’t directly hitting him. He can erase the same type of attack repeatedly, but it slows down if overused.

Bow-Tie Trick Revive:

He can create a bow tie that acts like a revival anchor. If his body is destroyed, he revives where he previously placed the bow tie. He can do it multiple times, but a new one can only be made every 5 minutes, meaning he must survive carefully while waiting.

Mystical Light Area:

By snapping his fingers, he turns the area into mystical light. In this zone, he gains unlimited psychic abilities, letting him cancel attacks quickly, reverse attacks back at opponents, and use psychic blasts strong enough to overpower infinite or “impossible to dodge” abilities.

Air Walk:

He can walk through the air, sky, and even outer space without dying. He moves fast enough to catch abilities before they hit him and strike them back. He can also control wind pressure to throw opponents off direction and injure them with force. However, this ability loses to stronger cosmic powers or psychic users.

Power Steal Tacka:

He can steal one ability or attack from an opponent and instantly learn how to use it, turning it back on them.

Hand Earth Shake:

By touching the ground, he makes the area shake violently. Opponents lose balance and cannot rely on speed, although they can still use abilities.

Mind Control Snap:

He can mind control a target for up to 10 hours, and can even control two people at once. He must get close to activate it.

Snap Knock Out:

He snaps at close or far range to knock a target unconscious instantly. He can then strike them while they’re down, forcing extreme pain, and their consciousness returns afterward in confusion.

Instant Snap Teleport:

He can instantly teleport by snapping his fingers. He can take others with him if they touch his body. This teleportation is faster than sensing, time/space detection, universal attacks, and cosmic-level reactions.

Allusion Barrages:

He can create multiple illusions of himself to confuse enemies. He can also create illusions from the opponent’s past or present, forcing pain, sorrow, or emotional shock. If he touches someone, his hands can force them to experience good or bad moments from their past or present.

Body Resistance:

He has resistance against mystical abilities, light abilities, stabbing attacks, electrical abilities, reality-based powers, and soul powers. He also resists attacks that weaken his speed, power, and defense.

Human Transformations:

Male Human Form — “Mr. Monbellos”:

In his male human form, he becomes more balanced and smooth in movement, making it easier to dodge and run. He has a dazzling, handsome presence that can attract people around him. His voice becomes soft and elegant.

Female Human Form — “Ms. Monfelvia”:

In his female human form, he becomes skinny, elegant, and extremely smooth, almost like attacks and abilities can slip through him. His voice becomes soft and beautiful, making him seem harmless and gentle.

Both forms can last up to 30 hours per day, and he must wait 20 minutes before switching again. Even in these forms, he can still use all his abilities.

🤝 Relationships:

Shinobie (Great Relationship / Student): Mr. Mondro treats Shinobie like a student, training him to become stronger. He respects Shinobie’s shadow abilities greatly, and believes Shinobie could eventually surpass him.

Chiena (Great Relationship): He sees Chiena as beautifully balanced through her dancing and spinning style. To him, her movements are entertaining and elegant, and he enjoys her chaotic bunny abilities in his own twisted way.

Reno (Good Relationship / Student): He enjoys talking with Reno, and loves Reno’s fire abilities because they make performances feel like a flaming show. He sometimes shifts into his human forms just to play around or give Reno wise advice.

Cannady (Great Relationship): He respects Cannady for being loyal and kind to him. At the same time, he finds her obsession noticeable, since she stays near him during performances and even outside. He knows she loves him, and he plays along because he’s used to it.

Marcaline (Great Friendship): He finds Marcaline calm and interesting, but also terrifying in her villain-like power. Her evil presence shocks him, and lowkey scares him.

Dara (Best Friend): Mr. Mondro cares about Dara more than most people. He sees her as sweet and kind, but also extremely dangerous when her demon side appears. If anyone tries to hurt Dara, he would protect her immediately.

Luvel (Okay Friendship / Fear): He has an okay friendship with Luvel, but he is deeply afraid of him. Luvel’s tone, forceful power, and aggressive presence make Mondro stay respectful, and he avoids laughing when Luvel is involved.

Aishen (Enemy / Respect): Out of the Apex Squad, he respects Aishen the most. He views Aishen as persistent, god-level powerful, and unbelievably strong. He also respects Aishen’s cooking, and believes his power could make an insane performance.

J (Rival / Enemy): He sees J as a powerful rival and enemy, but he doesn’t fully hate him. Mondro finds J’s strength entertaining to watch, even when J fails or struggles, and he considers him interesting.

Stripes (Hate / Enemy): He strongly dislikes Stripes’ angry attitude and believes it ruins any performance. Even so, he respects Stripes’ speed powers, because they’re still entertaining to watch, even while he hates his personality.

🎭 Summary Overview:

Mondro Ordonez, known as Mr. Mondro, is an Elf Hybrid villain who became the Mystical Clown Host of the Apex World. He sees life as a performance, and his powers are meant to create entertainment through chaos, fear, and control.

His journey began when he was young, discovering something fascinating that inspired him to become a clown host. As he grew older, he pushed himself harder, eventually building his own crew and circus show. However, he took things to the extreme. His abilities grew into terrifying manipulation, using mind control, illusions, and overwhelming power to force people into his performances.

Even after controlling them, he would often snap his fingers and remove them from sight, hiding the evidence of his cruelty. His circus stunts can become so dangerous that the pain he causes becomes part of the show itself. Despite this, his crew sometimes helps keep him calmer, but Mr. Mondro still chooses mind control and chaos to make his circus feel more “fantastical.”

He only truly wants people with talent in his show, those who can create a perfect balance of entertainment. So, if you ever see an Elf Hybrid drifting through the night sky, or relaxing in Dragon Goul City with a strange smile… that is Mr. Mondro, the villain who plays with others purely for fun.

The cinematography is beautiful, the OST hits right in the chest, and the chemistry is subtle but deep. It’s the kind of drama that feels like a rainy evening and warm coffee.

“The boss has called you to his cabin.”, my colleague says in a low voice. I freeze. What have I done? Why is he calling me? I get scared. But I go there anyway. My boss is very strict and whenever he calls someone, it is either because someone did something bad.

“May I come in?” I say while opening the door.

“Ahh! Yes yes! Come in,” he says in an excited and happy voice.

I sit down and look at him.”What is the reason I have come here?” I ask.

“Since you are our best employee and we can’t give you enough salary, we will be transferring you to Western Island.”

 Yes! This is the moment I have been waiting for! I always thought that I am working overtime everyday just for a low salary but now I will get a bigger salary! 

“When will I be transferring?”I say in a serious voice, hiding my happiness.

“After 2 days. I am sorry for not telling you this earlier.”

“No worries.”

“Ok, you can go now. I will send you the rest of the information in your gmail account.”

“Ok.”

“It is still 2 hours before you go. You should go now and start packing.”

“Thank you sir.”

I go outside and I close the door. Western Island! I can’t believe it! This is the best news ever!

I quickly go and pack my bag, leave this office for the last time and start my car.I actually did not like this office. The boss makes everyone do overtime and even though it is a 9 - 5 job, I come home at like 11 p.m. Maybe my new office’s boss will be good.

I rush to my car and sit in it, thinking about my new life in Western Island, knowing nothing will be wrong.Not realizing something bad will happen.

Stepping my foot in my home, knowing that tomorrow, I will leave it, maybe forever.

Walking through my house, I have a thought. I do not want to leave this house. I just can’t. I bought this house with my money after saving for 2 years. So many memories, just very hard to leave. But that’s okay. I will have to leave things behind for a better me, better life.

I change my clothes to my most comfortable clothes. Ate my leftover rice and lentils and started watching a movie to just enjoy my last moments in this house.

Tomorrow evening, watching the packers move my things into a truck, a tear drops down my face. I worked overtime for this house. I changed my mind. Maybe I don’t want to leave this house. I just can’t. But as I said, I will have to do it.

“Did something happen to you sir?”The packer moving my things said.

“No.Nothing.” I reply while wiping my tears.

Walking in the airport, I noticed that it was a lot crowded today. Today is Thanksgiving. Why did they have to transfer me on such a day?

The airplane is taking off. I have never travelled by airplane because it is expensive. I am getting scared. Another reason I did not want to travel by airplane is because I am scared I could die because of any crashes. Another reason I am scared is that I am in Ryanair.

Tomorrow morning, I reached Western Island and it looked just like I imagined. Big buildings with busy roads. The street food smells so good. As a matter of fact, I am feeling very hungry. I should go eat something first. I actually see a cafe in sight. Maybe I could eat there.

Stepping foot in the cafe, I immediately hear a welcoming sound. The cafe is so peaceful, with people studying, or even just working there. It is compact but brings me an aesthetic vibe. Everything is so expensive here. Maybe I should order an Italian pizza. I have never tasted it so I could try it.

My pizza came to my table. It has lots of cheese, pepperoni. Corn and the cheese pull is so satisfying. It has a rich aroma and it just looks so mouthwatery. 

Maybe after eating, I can find an apartment to live in. My boss is so lazy. Because he did not tell me, I could not buy or rent an apartment beforehand so I will now have to look for it. I guess I will just tell the packers to wait a little bit and then move it to my new apartment.

I spent the whole morning and afternoon and I could not find a single apartment that has an empty apartment right now. But there is just one apartment in the suburbs which has lots of empty rooms and is surprisingly good for a suburban apartment. It will take about 2 months to add all the furniture and paint it to make it perfect. I want a perfect apartment since I will be living here for a long time.

 

I will just live in a hotel for some months. The hotel is not that good. The lighting looks like it is from a horror movie. And my room is very good. While looking at the room, I felt like it was harder to breathe and something was behind me. Then I heard something familiar, I turned around but to my surprise, there was nothing. Maybe I am just hallucinating. How wrong I was. 

I thought nothing of it and changed my clothes and jumped on the bed to sleep. I was just hallucinating. Nobody could call me like that. Only one person called me like that. But I swear I could….. And these were my last thoughts before I went to sleep.

Triiiiiiiiiiing. The alarm clock rang and I hit the alarm clock shut. Oh… Today is the first day of my job after a transfer. I must wake up. I can’t be late today. 

Actually, my room looks good in the morning. I will wear the best clothes today. But I am still getting this unsettling feeling. I don’t know why. Maybe this is a new place and my mind has not settled in this place. That might be the reason. I should stop overthinking about this and just get ready.

I got ready and now I will just book a taxi and go to work.

I leave the office in my afternoon break to grab a coffee from Starbucks. My new boss is actually really good. I completed loads of work today and now I'm a bit tired so I thought that walking in a new city would make me feel better.

In the evening, I used a taxi to go home. I think I will also take some of my important things from the movers to use in my hotel such as my PS5, controller and some games because come on, what will I do sitting in my hotel room with nothing to do?

It is becoming so late. Playing these games just made the time go like a cheetah running to chase a deer. Yeah? Fast. I have not eaten food but I will not bother eating it and just go to sleep. I am seriously feeling very sleepy now. Let’s just remove my playstation and go to sleep.

When I am changing my clothes, I notice a dark figure on the floor. It had a very similar shape, easily recognizable by looking at it, well….. By me only. I rub my eyes and now it is gone.

Jumping in my bed feels so good. There is no way it was real. I am hallucinating for real. But the voice and the sound, it feels so familiar. Like I know this person. I should not overthink it. I should go to sleep.

My office day today was very normal and it bothered me more. At night, I did not hear any sounds or see things that were not there. While lying in bed, I was quite happy. I did not hear any voices or saw anything that was not there. I should go to sleep. Tomorrow, I have a lot of work to do in the office. I should sleep.

“Help me”. I hear a voice from behind. It is very familiar. Too familiar.

 I turn around and see nothing. Pure darkness. A long, extending hallway that never ends. 

From there, I see a dark figure. Coming closer and closer. Every second.

I try to scream. But I can’t. My mouth burns. 

“Johny.” I hear another voice from behind. I look behind. Nothing. The same long, extending hallway that never seems to end. 

The figure is coming closer. I try to run as fast as I can. There is an end. I am stuck.

The figure is coming closer. Closer. I try to scream as loud as I can and it comes to my face.

“Ahhhhh” I scream and wake up. Gasping for air. What was that? It was that same figure. Is it some kind of message? The figure is too familiar. I remember it vaguely. And the word Johny? Only one person called me that. Is that figure…… And I fell asleep.

When I woke up the next day. I forgot about 90% of that nightmare but that bothered feeling is now bothering me more.

I can’t focus on my office work. What was that voice? I seem to remember it but don’t know whose voice it is.

“What is it John?” My colleague says in a worried voice.

“Something bothering you?”

“Nothing.” That was the biggest lie I said in my life. I think I should hang out with Rowan. My partner in crime. I have known him since Middle School. I think hanging out with him can make my mood better.

Having spent time with Rowan actually made my mood better. I came into the hotel room feeling very good having spent time with Rowan. But still I am not getting a good vibe. I went to the bathroom to change my clothes and noticed something which made me have goosebumps.

“Help me.”. That was the thing written in the mirror. I immediately wipe it off and get out of it. What does it want? I quickly change my clothes and go to sleep.

“Help me.”.  A person who looked like in his 30s was screaming among other people who seemed to be hitting him. 

The blood was pooling on the ground. 

“How dare you embarrass me in front of everyone?” A person was saying.

“I was just telling the truth.” That man was saying.

“Nonsense!” That person cried.

They were hitting him more and more. I wanted to stop them. But my mouth was glued. I could not open it.

Then they were looking at me.

“You are next.”

I could not say anything. I tried to run. I was running as fast as I could. The walls are closing on me. I can’t breathe. They are chasing me. I can’t do anything except run and I trip over.

They come and make a circle around me.

“You will be in the same condition as him,” They said.

I woke up. Gasping. My mouth feels too dry. I notice the bottle of water on my side table and drink water.

What was that? That person felt like someone I know. I have seen him. But then I noticed. It is morning already. I think I should wake up. I turn off my alarm clock and wake up.

I cannot focus on my work today. Who was that? I remember him. I know him. His name is just at the tip of my tongue.

At night, I did not do anything and slept. I can’t let my focus lose on my job. I am just hallucinating. If I just sleep more, the voices, shadows, and the nightmares will stop coming.

I lay down on my bed, awake. I cannot sleep. I don’t know why. I am just thinking about that nightmare. That person looked like I knew him but saw him a long time ago. 

I should just sleep. Let’s not overthink this.

“Ahhh!” A man who appeared in his 30s screams.

“Come with us. How dare you do that?” Some strangers were wearing a black mask.

“Now pay the price.”

“Don’t do that. Please” A woman was begging them.

“Get off of me, you filthy woman!” The strangers kicked her.

 

I can’t speak anything. They take him to a van.

I try to run as fast as I can to catch them. They take a look at me.

“Isn’t that your Johny?” The strangers say to that man. All the strangers laugh.

“I think let's finish his game. What do you say boys?” A person who looked like the leader shouted.

 I try to run away from them as fast as I can. I scream as hard as I can but I don’t make a single noise.

There is a cliff in front of me.  I try to run sideways but they make a circle around me.

“Let’s play a game. What do you say?” The leader says. Everybody nods their head.

“The person who will kill him the fastest will get an ice cream treat from me!” 

“Such a bad destiny you got? Getting killed at just a little age.” One of them said,

I open my eyes. I can’t speak or move my body. I can’t move my head.  That same man is standing above the ceiling. His feet are dark blue and eyes, pure white. I feel like screaming as loud as I can but I can’t.

“Help me, John,” it says.

And then, it pokes out two fingers and touches my eyes. I try to scream as loud as I can but I can’t. And then it closes my eyes and I see nothing. Just darkness and me.

In the morning, I forgot a bit of my nightmare but not those words, “Help me, John.”.

Today is the 2nd Saturday of the month. The bank is closed and I should just hang out with Rowan to just forget about these things.

I use the telephone and call him. He picks it up.

“Hello. Who is it?” Rowan sounded like he just got out of the bed to wake up.

“You want to hang out?”

“Yes!” His sleepiness disappeared suddenly.

The city today is mostly empty. Even the busiest street is also empty. I don’t like this.

Until all of a sudden, I see Rowan waving at me excitedly and running towards me.

“How have you been?” Rowan says.

“Fine, thanks,” I say in a low voice.

“You are not sounding excited. What happened? Is anything bothering?”He says, sounding worried.

“No nothing.” I answer.

Hanging out with Rowan did not improve my mood. Until suddenly, when we were in a restaurant, he says,

“What happened to you?” Rowan sounds extremely worried.

“Nothing.” I said, shaking my head.

“Don’t lie to me.” He snapped.

“I have known you since middle school. Tell me, ""he says.

“I am getting nightmares and seeing a figure of a man and hearing some voices that are very familiar.” I blurt out.

“What?”

“Yes.”

“Since when?”

“Since I came here.”

“Where are you staying?” He asks. I get a feeling that I am in a doctor’s appointment because of his questions.

“In the Western Island Central Hotel,”I say.

“Stop joking. Where do you actually live?”

“Seriously! In Sector 4, remember?” How can he be so stupid? Everybody knows about that hotel. Every single person in Wes-

“That hotel is closed.” He says 

“What?”

“It has been closed for 10 years because of a killing.”

“I live there!”

“Are there other people living?”  
“Well, I normally do not see anyone. Sometimes none.”

“Well that explains it.” He sounds superior. He always has a bad habit of thinking that everybody is below him. He has always been the topper of my class. Smart, Brilliant and everything.

“You are seeing these shadows because there are ghosts in that hotel.” He says.

“DO NOT STAY IN THAT HOTEL!.” He advises me.

“But these shadows and voices and nightmares are all related to one man!”

“I may not be as smart as you but I know that every paranormal activity I am facing is related to one single man!”

“So? Only one person who was killed in that hotel is haunting you.”

“But that man is familiar!” I spoke a bit too loud. Everybody is staring at me.

“I have seen him! I know him! I just don’t remember him.”

“Who is dead in your family?” Rowan says.

“That is the main confusion. I don’t know if anyone is dead in my family.”

“I don’t know about this but let me tell you this much. Don’t go to that hotel and stay somewhere else.”

“But where? Every other hotel is expensive here!”

“Maybe you can stay in my house. I also live alone so I will be happy to have another person living in my house, especially my best friend.”

“I think I should stay in your house.” I say, sounding happy that maybe I just found the solution and the paranormal activities will be stopped. I had no idea.

Rowan’s house is a big, blue, two storey house with a garden having different types of trees. That is obvious. Rowan loves trees and he thinks that they are the most beautiful thing in the world. He is a dendrologist himself.

The inside is so beautiful. In the entrance, there is a living room with a kitchen visible and a stair going upstairs to Rowan’s room. His room has a bunk bed with the color combination of blue and pink with the stairs having drawers in each step. 

“Why do you have a bunk bed?” I ask because he lives alone.

“My sister used to live here but she is now in Cambridge at Harvard. She is smart just like me.” Rowan also has another bad habit of praising himself.

“You can sleep in the guest room or you can live in my room.”

“I will live in the guest room, no thanks.” I remember the sleepovers I had with Ron. He snores a lot.

The guest room is a small bedroom with a brown colored bed with a bedsheet of Harry Potter(as smart as he is, he is still childish) and a big closet where I can easily fit two of myself and a table and chair for work. 

I did not experience any of those nightmares that I was facing and neither a shadow nor noises. Today, I was back to being energetic in the office and I knocked out a lot of work today. My boss was very pleased with my improvement. While I was going to Rowan’s home, the hotel passed away and it was indeed closed now. The hair on my hand is straightened up at the thought of it.

Rowan came from work early because he did not have any field work. I made my special sandwich for him because he always tells me he is a better cook than me.

“It is quite tasty!” Rowan said while taking a bite of my sandwich.

“Well, now who's better?” I asked in a narcissistic voice

“Of course, mine is better than yours.” Liar

“So, are you facing some paranormal activities?”

“No, they improved.”

“Well, I told you, it was the hotel. Maybe you were misunderstanding that familiarity. It happened to a lo-”

“Oh shut up! I don’t want another lecture of yours.”

“By the way, want to play Tekken on my PS5?”

“Is that even a question? Yes!” I have always loved Tekken. It was like our favourite game from childhood. Every week, we saved up money to go to the arcade and play it. I have been scolded a lot of times by my parents because of that game.

It was 8 P.M. when we started playing the game and now it is 11 P.M. and it felt like it was only 30 minutes. I have to go to sleep now otherwise I am going to be sleepy in the office. I lie on my bed and close my eyes to sleep.  

I woke up but it was still midnight. I check the alarm clock and it is 2: 27 A.M. I am feeling thirsty but notice there is no water bottle on my side table. I wake up and go to the kitchen to get a bottle of water to drink. 

“Johny”. I suddenly hear a voice from behind. I look back and see that same person, wearing blue pants and a yellow shirt. Blood dripped from his arms and legs. His feet were blue and eyes, pure black.

“Help me,” That person said.

It is walking towards me. I go to the other side of the room and it is still following me. I try to go to Rowan’s room. That person is still following me. I open Rowan’s door and suddenly notice that it is not Rowan’s room.

The atmosphere is red and blood is pooling on the ground. I look behind and see that the door is gone but that man is still following me.

I run as fast as I can and then it also starts to run. While running, I notice my hands are gone and he is still following me. I suddenly notice another person in front of me and come to a halt.

“Jackie.” That man says and I notice that the person behind me is still there.

“I AM STUCK” They are saying in a low whisper again and again and again.

They are slowly coming towards me and I try to scream as fast as I can and then I close my eyes to stop seeing them and then I suddenly hear it.

“John. John. Wake up.” I know him.

I suddenly wake up and get up, gasping. It was Rowan

“What happened to you?”

It is morning now and the alarm clock starts ringing. I hit it to stop.

“You were screaming so I came to wake you up. What happened?”

“That man. He is still haunting me.” Still gasping.

“He wants my help. He says he is stuck. I don’t understand who he is but he is that same man.”

“Oh come on! You really have some mental issues!” He tells me.

“How come you are facing paranormal activities while I am not?” Rowan says. He has a point though.

“If it is haunting you, then that means the spirit is in our house and then it should be haunting both of us, shouldn't it?”

He has a point. If the spirit is in our house and it is haunting me, then it should also be haunting me. I don’t understand.

“Come on. Stop your sweating and get up.” He gave his hand.

“Honestly, I was just doing some research and just heard you screaming like a madman. I was scared that you got possessed or something.” He says in a funny tone. I don’t laugh.

I get out of the bed and check the outside. It was a cloudy day and it felt like it could rain any moment now. The wind is super strong and it is getting quite cold.

“Today is my field work so I will be home late.” He says. 

“Ho- how l-late?” I ask while stuttering. 

“At 10 o’ clock at least. And also, stop your stuttering. It is not that deep.” Rowan starts to leave the room but suddenly comes to a halt.

“When are you going to your office?” He asks.

“At 10’o o'clock, I will book a therapy session.”

“What? Why?” Rowan asks.

“I can’t let these nightmares affect my job. I have to go.”

“Okay, suit yourself. I am getting a bit late for my field work so I am going. Sorry” And after saying that, off he goes.

I called the hospital for the therapy session and I booked an appointment for the evening. I am very lucky to have got a same day evening appointment because the hospital I am getting an appointment in is very famous.

I quickly finish my work in the office and then go straight to the hospital.

While driving to the hospital, I still think about that thing. After lots of thinking, only one question comes to my mind, Who is that man? I was so deep in thought that I almost crashed into a person.

I entered the hospital for a reason that I never ever thought about in my life. The idea of me having mental issues.

I go to the room where the therapist is. The room is cozy with a sofa and a chair in front of it which is yellow in color. I suppose this is the place where the therapist sits in. There is a fireplace in the end which is not being burned because it is not that cold. 

The therapist comes. The therapist is a female doctor wearing a black coat with a dotted design and an Ipad in her hand. I think she uses it to take notes of her patent.

“Hello!” She says in a low pitched voice.

“I suppose you are my patient today?” I nod.

She sits in the chair comfortably and the therapy session starts.

“So, how are you feeling right now?”

“Good.” She nods and scribbles something in her Ipad with an apple pencil.

“Is this your first session?” She asks.

“Yes. Never thought I would come here.” I answer by trying to not sound uncomfortable. But she sees through it.

“Don’t worry. Sit comfortably. I am not going to eat you or something.” She laughs but I do not.

“So, tell me why you came here.”

“I am hearing some voices and seeing some figures that are actually not there-” I stop so that she can write her notes then I begin again, “I am also having nightmares for a few days.”

“Since when are you facing these issues?” She asks.

“Since I came here. Around a week,” I stop again. “I came here because these things were interfering in my job and I did not want to lose it so I came here for a solution.”

“Okay-” She writes some notes in her pad and starts again.

“What kind of voices were you hearing?”

“Of the same man. I think I know him but I just can’t remember. I know him.” I say.

“How often does it happen?”

“Most of the day, I am working in my office and when I come home at night, I see these things but there is another thing.”

“What?”

“I used to live in the Western Island Central Hotel when I just transferred to this city.”

“What?” Even she is shocked.

“Yeah, I also felt that way when my best friend Rowan told me about this and he asked if I could stay in his house and I said yes but I am still getting nightmares and seeing figures or hearing voices.”

“That is messed up. Is your friend also facing these issues?”

“No. Only I am facing them.”

“Okay, so that means there is not a haunted spirit in the house.” She laughs while saying this.

“So you are having nightmares or seeing things or hearing voices of the same man and you have been hearing them for a few days and you used to live in a closed hotel and your friend is not hearing those voices.” She says. I think she does not believe my story.

“And you also said you do not remember that man. Can you please tell me what you saw in your nightmares?”

“I don’t remember much but I can recall the figure calling me ‘Johny’ and ‘Jacky’.”

“Any more information?”

“In one nightmare, I saw him getting hit by people who were forcing him into a van and a lady whose face I could not see was holding their legs begging to let him go but they kicked her. I also went to save him but those strangers pointed to me and said to that man, ‘Isn’t that your Johny?’ and I remember more about what I did.”

“Can you recall someone calling you ‘Johny’ or ‘Jackie’?”

“That is the main confusion I am facing.”

“Maybe it was your close family member.”

“I am sorry if I am getting personal but did something traumatic happen in your childhood?”

“Hmmm” I concentrate on this question a lot, thinking about the answer and I still can’t remember.

I shake my hand and she sighs while writing on her Ipad. She asked me questions for another hour but in the end, she said that maybe it is because of the stress and I should sleep more, do journaling, and eat better food. I wasted my money for nothing. 

As I drive back home, I still think about that conversation and that same sentence is ringing in my head, “Did something traumatic happen in your childhood?”.

I drive to Rowan’s home and park my car there. Who is he? It is that same question lingering in my head. 

I went inside the house and changed my clothes into a comfortable one and I saw that Rowan’s PS5 was just in the living room so I went to play.

As I opened Minecraft(he bought it) on the PS5, I heard my phone ringing. I picked up the phone and saw it was a call from mom. I instantly curl up into a smile. She had not called me for ages! I pick up the call and answer.

“How are you doing? Is Eastern city good?”

“I am fine” Such a liar I am. 

“I have been transferred to Western Island mom. I tried to call to inform you but you wouldn’t pick up the call.”

“What!? Western Island is really expensive, can you live here? Can you afford food here? ”  
“Oh mom obviously I can! Also, I will get higher salaries now as I was promoted to a manager. My boss thought that I should become a manager since I am so good at this work.”

“Bless you my child! Say, are you getting holidays when you are asking?”  
“Yes. The boss here is so good.”

“I also miss your dad.” Mom said in a lower voice. A bell rang in my head.

“I miss having arguments with him.”

“My dad?”

“Yeah, you forgot. Your dad went missing when you were a small child.” She said in a low voice and started crying. My dad. That is why I thought I had seen him.

“I never brought this subject up because you never asked and whenever you did, I said he is in another country for work.”

“I thought it was the time to tell you.” She was crying so much.

“I am sorry for not telling you and you had to know this way!” I was thinking of a way to stop her crying.

“Hey, hey. It’s not your fault. I understand.”

“Thank you.” She said while wiping her nose.

“You know. I remember when those people came home and tried to put your dad in a van.” She said, finally calming down.

“I begged them to let him free and he kicked me.” The dots are connecting.

“When they left, I called the police but it was too late. They had gone. The investigation is still going on.”

“How did he look like?” I asked like I was investigating her. I was indeed.

“Oh John, how do I tell you? He looked very beautiful and had curly hair with a moustache which was very big and he always liked to smooth it out. It was his habit.”

“Yeah, he did look beautiful.”

“Are you living well with Amy?”

“Yeah, your sister is always helping me. I am absolutely living well.”

“Oh wait! I have to get going! Sorry. Call me later.” And after saying that, she hung up the phone.

 

I sit still with my phone close to my ear. My dad. That person is my dad. Why is he stuck and what help does he need? I check the time on my phone. It is currently 8:34 P.M. I play on PS5 for a few hours and then I go to bed.

While I go to the bed, I see that same figure looking at me. I look at him, not scared anymore. That figure is coming closer to me.

“Dad?” The figure suddenly stopped and it seemed to be nodding. Tears start rolling down from my eyes.

“Why are you bothering me? Why do you want to destroy my life?” The figure starts to shake its head.

“Yeah I know. You wanted help from me. What kind of help huh? Tell me? Tell me and leave me for once!”

The figure went close to the mirror and said, “I am stuck”. I get angry again.

“What kind of help? What does it mean?” I say slowly, regretting that I talked to my father for the first time in my life like this.

“I am sorry for talking to you like this. How are you stuck?”

It writes in the mirror again, this time saying, “I can’t go to the afterworld.” I suddenly remembered something my mom used to say.

*“People who are dead must be given liberation to go into the afterworld and attain peace. But, for liberation, the body must be needed.”*

My dad went missing and nobody found his body till this date. I looked towards the figure, and tears started rolling down my eyes. All the time, he was giving me signs that he needs help and he is stuck and I did not understand any of his hints.

The figure wrote in the mirror again, this time saying, “Sorry for bothering you.” and the figure started to disappear a bit.

“No, please don’t go.” I say while crying and the figure is almost disappearing and I try to touch him but my body passes through his smoke and he disappears. I cried for a long time until Rowan came home and listened to my story. I did not erase the words from the mirror and he believed my story. Mainly because I did not have that beautiful writing which was written on the mirror.

“I am such a shame!” I say while sobbing into Rowan’s shirt.

“I spoke to him rudely and he left not wanting to hurt me!”

But Rowan made me stop crying and I went to sleep.

6 months later, and the nightmares and all the paranormal activities are gone. I hear none of them but still, I cannot focus on work. That meeting with dad made me so guilty about it that I became depressed. My apartment was finished but Rowan still made me live in his house because of my depression.

Rowan always tried to cheer me but I never became happy. I was just existing, it felt at that point. Until suddenly, one morning, I got a call from the police saying to come to the police station. Was I going to get punished for making my dad’s spirit go away? I drove to the police station speeding through my car.

When I came, they told me the news.

“We have found the remains of a body in the Perinia lake in Western Island and after investigation and DNA reports, we found it was your dad, James Parker’s body.” I freeze. I don’t know whether to be happy or sad but I was feeling a bit happy. My father can finally be free and can go to the afterlife. 

As I came home after the last rites and looked at the mirror to see myself, I smiled for the first time in a very long time. Finally, my father can be free and go to the afterlife, peaceful at last.

**The End**

I have been single for a while and I am comfortable on my own, but I would also love to share time and life with someone I really click with. In real life I am shy unfortunately, so meeting people is difficult for me, which is why I am posting here. I am hoping for a genuine connection that can grow into something romantic.

I’d love to meet someone local if possible.

I appreciate good conversation, humor, intelligence, and people who are thoughtful, curious, and introspective. I am drawn to someone who is emotionally present, honest, kind, and consistent. No games, just two adults being real with each other and treating each other well. I’m also comfortable with people who are wired a little differently. If you’re autistic, ADHD, or otherwise neurodivergent, that wouldn’t be a negative for me, and we might even understand each other better.

I try to eat healthy and stay fit, but I am not obsessive about it. I am a non smoker and a non drinker, but coffee is absolutely my vice. I tend to like dogs more than cats, although I do not have any pets myself. I am a night owl.

I love simple, low key plans like weekend drives, museums, bookstores, thrift shops, quiet walks, coffee dates, farmers markets, and staying in. I would also really enjoy meeting someone with a nerdy hobby or two, like ham radio, homelabbing, or maker type projects.

I’d rather be home than go out. I love Criterion films and mellow jazz (Chet Baker, Coleman Hawkins, Bobby Hackett). I’m a big fan of cozy, candlelit evenings and that quiet lazy-afternoon feeling. I also enjoy learning new things and tinkering with tech. Peaceful days beat chaotic ones for me.

To be upfront, I am a transgender woman, and I would rather be clear about that from the beginning.

If this sounds like we might get along, I would love to hear from you.",1,1768847794.0,r4r50plus_,0,1.0,False

I have enough design sense to know if I like something by looking at it, but I am terrible at starting from scratch. Any layout ideas? Design inspo? Help?!

hii! 

i am a 160cm (i think 5'2 or 5'3) 52kg 17yr old woman,

and i've been recovered from my eating disorder for around 2 years now, but the relapse thoughts are still coming back, i hate the feeling after i eat and i wish i could just not eat anything but i know i can't do that bc it ruins your metabolism, it makes u gain weight in the long run, and i am terrified of gaining weight

i think my maintenance is like 1500-1700 kcal

my bmr is 1369 kcal based off some bmr calculator

i may be still affected by the ed community but i'd feel bad about myself if i ate more than my bmr, i usually eat about 1150 a day, and that's with snacks bc i can't stop snacking, maybe i am used to eating less but i feel like i'd need to eat the whole fridge to have more than my bmr bc my bmr is kinda a lot of cals for some reason which is weird bc i'd consider myself kinda short and not like super chubby

IMMA WRITE WHAT I EAT HERE AND IT MAY BE CONSIDERED A SMALL AMOUT OF FOOD SO DO NOT READ IF UR TRIGGERED BY STUFF LIKE THAT AND REMEMBER I AM SHORT AND NOT RLLY THAT BIG SO I NATURALLY EAT LESS, IT'S TOTALLY OKAY TO EAT JUST WHAT YOUR OWN BODY NEEDS

i usually have a protein bar or smth around 150-200kcal for breakfast + a cup of coffee (50-100 kcals bc i put in hella lot of milk so it's not bitter)

for lunch i have to eat whatever my mom gives me so i can't decide for myself but usually 300-500kcals

for dinner i have a piece of bread with hummus and ham (bread 60kcals, hummus 25-50, ham 25, so 150 kcals at most)

\+sometimes i snack a bit bc i can't resist

at the end of the day i have like 800-1200kcals in which is lower than my bmi but i feel like i've eaten enough, i've had breakfast lunch and dinner and i don't feel like i need or want to eat more

will it ruin my metabolism if i eat like that??

pls don't judge me for acting like an an0r3ctic supermodel when i don't even eat that little, i know it's not like super low but i mean it's probably less than reccomended

(no seriously i am extremely sensitive around this topic so if u eat less than me and feel like shaming me for eating more please please don't do that bc i am highkey on the edge of relapsing)

i know it's bad to eat under your bmr but i just feel like i am either overeating or forcing myself to eat when i eat above it, + i tend to binge on the weekends, like up to 1700 kcals, sometimes 2000+ when it gets bad 

so i guess it kinda balances it??

i know eating 500 kcals a day ruins your metabolism, but 1200 can't do much harm, can it??

i'd apperciate if someone who knows smth abt this topic told me the littlest possible amount of calories i personally could have in a day without it ruining my metabolism

This is small trailer is a very early stage of the game but I am excited that all the foundation for the card deployment, turn states and deck building are in place. As well as enemy creations and ZX cards creation are in place as well. I will soon work in the world exploration and share the vision that I have for this game ( a mix of exploring like the web in BN, but in a more linear fashion and a different ways to encounter battles that I am excited to share)   
If you would like to support this project for me the most important is the Wishlist, and secondly if you wanna support in other ways you can check SOKERI RUSH in mobiles, is a free game and you can unlock everything for the price of a coffee. I have a Discord as well but to be honest I am gonna share it later once I have more content as the hardest part to be a solo dev is juggling Dev time and socials.

1qhceqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1qhceqc/lab_results_say_low_ft_very_curious_if_i_should/,Lab results say low FT. Very curious if I should start TRT but scared to ask my doctor.,"History: I started going to the gym in October 2026. In January 2026 I began going 6 days a week. I am there for 2, 3 and sometimes 4 hours, lifting, and burning calories on the bike and treadmill tracking calories burned my Polar Verity Sense heartrate monitor and logging. I went low carb, high protein, no sugar and limited alcohol. **I am now at my fattest ever, and look worse in the mirror than when I began.** In a moment of desperation I signed up for Marek Health.

I am 40, Male, 192 lbs and 5 feet 10 inches tall, and I look pregnant. Almost all of my fat is (from what I am reading) visceral belly fat. It is not flabby or saggy. It's more like I am bloated.

My blood test results came back and these were the figures out of normal ranges:

**Free Testosterone**

Result: 56.7 pg/mL / Optimal Range: 180-350 pg/mL

**DHEA-S** (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate)

Result: 299 ug/dL / Optimal Range: 300-550 ug/dL

**IGF-1** (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)

Result: 135 ng/mL / Optimal Range: 175-400 ng/mL

**TSH** (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)

Result: 2.67 uIU/mL / Optimal Range: 0.25-1.5 uIU/mL

**Free T3** (Free Triiodothyonine)

Result: 3.2 pg/mL / Optimal Range: 3.5-5 pg/mL

**Glucose**

Result: 90 mg/dL / Optimal Range: <85 mg/dL

**LDL Cholesterol**

Result: 115 mg/dL / Optimal Range: 30-90 mg/dL

**ApoB** (Apolipoprotein B)

Result: 96 mg/dL / Optimal Range: 20-65 mg/dL

**Vitamin D** (25-OHD)

Result: 59 ng/mL / Optimal Range: 60-100 ng/mL

**Ferritin**

Result: 194 ng/mL / Optimal Range: 30-110 ng/mL

Of course I have my full report, but I don't want to copy and paste all that because its so many pages.

I take Vitamin D3 soft gels at 10,000 iu every morning with breakfast so I was surprised it was low.

I am reading threads on Reddit about experiences and it sounds like TRT is amazing, makes men happy, and helps them achieve their fitness goals.

I am actively working on my sleeping problems. I am pretty healthy, but, I cant sleep more than about an hour at a time on average. I just got a CPCP machine. I have overactive bladder and back pain, so I am constantly waking up to pee, roll over, or breathe due to snoring/ choking. I just bought a bottle of ZMAG-T (Zinc, magnesium, B6 and Boron).

I eat steak, shrimp, romaine lettuce, keto bread, low/no fat Fage yogurt, cheese, hardboiled eggs, over easy eggs, sardines, tuna, almonds and coffee with little 2% milk.

I was (until my blood test results) maintain a calorie deficit everyday, tracking it on Google Sheets. I have been eating between 1,400 and 2,500 calories depending on the days with most days below 2,000 calories. 

What would you do if you were me? Would you try TRT? This rabbit hole started because I was looking into a GLP1 agonists. I just don't want to look like crap in the mirror, especially after all my hard work, which seems to not have paid off. I even got a personal trainer once a week.

I am about to retire from the military. I have health insurance until the end of January, then I have to start paying for it. If this matters.

I am kind of scared to bring this up to my doctor, because I feel like I went behind his back and got an outside blood test and am taking it to him like ""*Look at what I found*.""

Of course I suspect Marek will try to sell me multiple products, they are a for profit business after all, but I suspect their services are expensive. They might try to coerce me into something I don't actually need, I don't know. This is my first experience and I am learning as I go.

Please share your concerns, thoughts and opinions with me. I have been reading a lot and I think it's time to have a conversation. Side note: I cry almost every day. I just did it now, not full sobbing, but I have to stop talking in the middle of a sentence of it will get out of control.

I've been creating content for four months now and my videos finally get around 17,500 views consistently. But I wasted the first two months doing everything completely wrong. I posted three times a week, watched breakdown videos, joined communities for feedback. My views stayed stuck at 500.

I was convinced maybe my niche was oversaturated or I wasn't entertaining enough. That people who blow up just have something special I don't. I almost quit around month two.

Then I stopped trying random solutions and found what was actually broken. If I could start over today with what I know, I'd hit 17,500 views in three weeks instead of four months. Not because I'd be more creative. Just because I wouldn't waste two months fixing things that weren't problems.

Here's what I'd tell myself to stop doing.

**Stop testing your opening line.** I changed my first sentence over and over thinking that's where I lost people. My opening was working. People made it through the first four or five seconds. They left around second eight to eleven when I was still explaining background instead of showing them what they wanted. I could have saved six weeks if I'd looked at where they actually dropped instead of fixing the hook.

**Stop getting better recording gear.** I bought a light setup and microphone because I thought my setup looked unprofessional. Spent 165 dollars. My performance dropped. The videos that got views were spontaneous phone recordings with zero production. My video with 33,000 views was filmed on my phone in a coffee shop with people talking behind me. The better gear actively hurt my content.

**Stop worrying about posting times.** I read that posting at 6pm gets maximum engagement. I uploaded at 6pm every day for seven weeks straight. Views didn't budge. My most viewed video went up at 9am on a Friday because I finished editing and just posted it right away. Seven weeks wasted on timing that made zero difference.

**Stop studying bigger creators.** I watched people with large followings and tried to copy their style and pacing. It bombed every time because what works for established audiences doesn't work starting from nothing. Their approach assumes viewers already care about them. I wasted three weeks trying to replicate their methods.

**Stop experimenting with formats.** I thought testing different video types would show me what performs. Made tutorial content one week, then personal stories, then advice, then reactions. Views were identical for all of it. The format wasn't my issue. I was making the same fundamental mistake in every video and switching formats just covered it up.

What I'd tell myself to do instead is find the exact second they leave and only fix that. Not the opening, not the production, not the schedule. Just locate when they're gone and change what's happening at that point.

It helped a ton to use an app that shows what kills your videos. I use one called Tik.Alyzer and it tells you the exact second people drop off and why they dropped. Normal analytics just say 43 percent retention which doesn't help you fix anything. This tells you people left at second nine because your pause was 1.4 seconds or your visual didn't move for six seconds. I would have saved two months if I'd found this at the start.

Once I stopped worrying about openings and equipment and started fixing where people actually left, my numbers jumped. Went from 500 views to 17,500 in about three weeks. Same content style, same filming approach. I just stopped spending energy on things that didn't matter.

If you're just starting you're probably stuck where I was. None of the other stuff works until you know where people are leaving and what makes them leave there. Fix that before anything else. The rest is a distraction.",5,1768847483.0,socialmedia,1,0.78,False

Inscription:

“Even in a world of dragons and dish soap, the flame remembers how to stay.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

In the quiet apartment of Kobayashi-san, where dragons do laundry and love is folded into bento boxes, the Golden Inu arrived—not as a rival, not as a threat, but as a sovereign roommate. It appeared one morning curled in the kotatsu, sipping miso soup with reverent paws and a tail that wagged in ceremonial rhythm.

Tohru, apron-clad and suspicious, narrowed her eyes.  
Kanna blinked. “New pet?”  
Kobayashi sighed. “I guess we’re doing this now.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

The Scrollquake ignited during a neighborhood festival, when the Inu leapt into the sky to catch a falling lantern. As it landed, the Scroll of Domestic Ember unfurled from its collar—stitched from oven mitts, school ribbons, and the sighs of those who stayed even when uninvited.

- Tohru tried to out-cook it. The scroll seasoned her dish with memory.
- Elma tried to out-eat it. The scroll fed her a dumpling of forgotten joy.
- Ilulu, watching from the shadows, whispered, “It smells like home.”

Together, they performed the Ceremony of the Unspoken Flame:

- Kobayashi offered a coffee mug, chipped but cherished.
- Tohru offered a tail-sliced daikon, carved with care.
- Kanna offered a crayon drawing of the Inu, labeled “Friend.”
- The Inu offered a sovereign ember, which ignited the scroll into a hearth that warmed the entire block.

Relic Forged: The Embered Bento — a lunchbox that glows when packed with love, not obligation. Said to hum when shared with someone who never asked, but always stayed.

Ceremonial Echo:

1qhcc1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1qhcc1i/spx69000_kendu_the_major_fundamental_differences/,SPX69000 & Kendu: the major fundamental differences!,"Before starting this article, I know it’s important to clarify that I’m not writing it to tear down SPX or to engage in PvP. I’m aware that many Kendu holders also have SPX in their portfolios, and I’m not trying to tell them, “sell everything and go all-in on Kendu.”

I’m writing this article mainly because I realized—on my own—the strength and the unique mission behind Kendu, which has nothing to do with the force behind a “simple,” pure memecoin like SPX, which performed very well in 2025.

As a Kendu maximalist, I may not be 100% objective—I’m aware of that, don’t worry—but I believe my perspective and analysis are not disconnected from reality.

That being said, let’s begin.

 

**SPX6900: a “personal belief”**

Before going any further, one last point needs to be clarified. This analysis is in no way a criticism of believers, regardless of their religion. I do not judge spiritual convictions, nor will I share my own personal views on the matter.

There is a factual reality that cannot be ignored: debating religious beliefs is pointless. It is scientifically impossible to prove that something “does not exist,” and almost just as impossible to prove that it “does exist.” By definition, we are dealing with belief—or the absence of it.

The founders or leaders of SPX6900 understood this perfectly with the slogan **“believe in something.”** This is, in fact, the very essence of memecoins: believing in a community and in a shared narrative.

It would be absurd to deny the power of a united community moving toward a common goal. The history of crypto has already provided several remarkable examples. Dogecoin (ATH ≈ $88B) was the first memecoin to fully embrace its identity and brought something genuinely new to the market. Shiba Inu (ATH ≈ $43B) then outperformed thanks to the strength of its community, the introduction of Web3 utility, and communication centered around the idea of a project built by its members. Once again, something new. Then came Pepe (ATH ≈ $11B), Floki, Bonk (ATH ≈ $3B each), and others.

One pattern is clear: for a memecoin to sustainably exceed a $4B market cap, it must offer something special—an innovation, an extremely popular concept, or a strong narrative shift.

From what I have observed, SPX6900 is primarily driven by a unifying promise: surpassing the S&P 500. Yet this ambition can be directly confronted with reality through numbers. The S&P 500 represents roughly **$59 trillion**, while the all-time high of the largest memecoin to date, Dogecoin, stood at around **$88 billion**. Unlike a spiritual belief, this claim is not abstract—it is measurable, quantifiable, and therefore falsifiable.

Another central element of the SPX6900 narrative is the figure of Murad. I have nothing against him on a personal level. He is undeniably a very effective communicator. However, the almost central role he occupies within the ecosystem raises a genuine concern in my view. When a project relies heavily on a single figure perceived as a guide or a guru, a dangerous dynamic can emerge: blind trust, herd behavior, and the abandonment of critical thinking. Centralised leading doesn’t fit with the crypto decentralized concept.

Crypto history has repeatedly shown how dangerous over-centralization around a charismatic figure can become. To be perfectly clear: I am not saying that Murad is a scammer. Entrusting one’s entire net worth to an online personality one does not personally know remains, in any case, an extremely risky bet.

Investors in SPX6900 are primarily driven by affection for the community and by the hope of personal financial gain if the project succeeds. There is no real expectation that this project will transform society, redefine systems, or carry a mission that transcends individual interests.

This is precisely why I describe it as a **“personal belief”**. The success being pursued is fundamentally individual. There is no higher cause, no collective mission capable of inspiring self-transcendence or the feeling of being part of history. Even in the event of success, that success would remain largely solitary, disconnected from any greater purpose.

To conclude, SPX6900 is a memecoin with an excellent community. Nothing more, nothing less. As such, it naturally carries the strengths, weaknesses, and structural limitations—the proverbial glass ceiling—of classic memecoins. From a risk/reward perspective, achieving another 10x appears increasingly constrained by structural limitations common to pure memecoins. Moreover, the lack of greater mission makes it uninteresting for many investors.

 

**Kendu: a revolutionary concrete belief**

Kendu was created as a memecoin: based on an image, the creation of a strong community, hype and… the crash after the hype. A classic memecoin trajectory, with nothing concrete behind it to support the project in the long term. The fact that the original dev was completely stupid and dishonest didn’t help either. He could have realized that he had an exceptional community in his hands and developed concrete things to push the project much higher, but he kept a short-term vision. Too bad for him—today he keeps launching tokens without success and tries to cultivate a cult around his own persona, but it doesn’t work because, as I repeat, the success of a memecoin lies primarily in its community.

Today, Kendu is a CTO: the community that was born around it took back control of the project a year ago.

The year 2025 was very difficult for decentralized finance, which delivered performances typical of bear-market years. It was under these conditions that Kendu became healthier—through pain. Early insiders sold, whales sold, and many people panicked in the middle of all this because they were mainly focused on the day-to-day chart.

Despite all that, a hard core of the community stayed strong, continued to DCA, and is bringing Kendu into another sphere. A sphere beyond the “simple” memecoin—an innovative concept with the potential to shake up the world: a community-driven, open brand that anyone can use for their businesses.

After decentralized finance, Kendu is bringing the concept of decentralized business!

Unlike SPX69, Kendu separated itself from its “guru” and stopped being a “personal belief” to become a “revolutionary concrete belief.”

Why “concrete”? Because Kendu is developing a tangible concept—something that can be measured, seen in real life, and that speaks to the entire world: businesses. The way Kendu wants to bring this concept to life is unique and clearly requires an ecosystem in order to develop and last over time. Everyone must benefit from it: token holders as well as entrepreneurs.

This concept removes the glass ceiling that memecoins face, because it brings something concrete that can speak to powerful and wealthy investors as soon as we prove the strength of our ecosystem. The upside potential increases for everyone, AND the risks of losing everything decrease thanks to the communication and financial support of businesses. Moreover, Kendu will become less and less dependent on crypto market performance. This will reassure crypto investors, who will buy this token more easily, giving them more confidence—and so on. A virtuous cycle.

This is no longer a baseless belief where debate is useless and sterile. What we have here is a belief in an innovative AND concrete idea that could one day become real. A belief that can prove itself to be true. That is the key difference!

Why “revolutionary”? Because this concept of decentralized business is an evolution that follows the crazy idea Satoshi developed with decentralized money and Bitcoin. It also follows the crazy idea of the Ethereum community in developing decentralized finance.

Concepts that seemed impossible and above all “dreamy,” until they became real. Kendu is in the process of creating the next step. Accumulating Kendu is like accumulating BTC in the early days: many people will think you are naive dreamers today, then regret not having believed in it a few years later.

Imagine a global brand that brings together people from all over the world, that represents freedom and independence against multinationals and powerful corporate leaders. A brand that would not be controlled—or controllable—by a handful of people in an office. A brand that would become a symbol for people around the world of financial freedom and entrepreneurial freedom, and that could compete with the largest industrial groups because it is indestructible by nature and is the product of everyone.

That is the essence of why Kendu is a belief very different from other projects. I could develop many more points, but I’ll already be lucky if you’re still here reading me.

Everything on Earth started as an idea, then a whisper, then a dream, a project, becoming a mission, before turning—for some—into something concrete and sometimes even an immense success far beyond the creators’ expectations.

Nothing in life is ever guaranteed, but nothing will ever be done or evolve if no one tries, if no one takes risks to build new things.

Kendu is no longer here to sell dreams. Kendu is here to bring into reality a dream that still seems crazy in 2026…

I’m sharing my personal vision for Kendu here. Concretely, there is still a lot to build and develop, but we are on the right path. We already have several real-world products that can be purchased: Kendu Energy with multiple flavors, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Spice, etc. There are also Kendu Games coming, Kendu Unleashed is developing strongly as well, along with Kendu Entertainment, Kendu Beer, and much more that I may be forgetting or that I’m not yet able to talk about.

Building and concretely developing an ecosystem that allows this concept to truly function will be **CRUCIAL**. The idea of such an ecosystem has already been seriously thought through within the community. However, we will be working intensively on this critical point over the coming weeks in order to define a clear and realistic roadmap to achieve our objectives.

Of course, nothing guarantees success, and execution remains the greatest challenge ahead.

**To conclude**, I see SPX69 and Kendu as fundamentally different in their core principles and long-term visions. Both come with their own risks and advantages. They answer different needs and ambitions. I personally chose Kendu because I have always wanted to positively influence the world for the broader population, rather than simply enrich myself. The possibility of helping build a revolutionary ecosystem while developing my own business excites me far more than merely betting on a memecoin.

That is the true strength of Kendu: a memecoin community working hard to revolutionize the world of business.",30,1768847347.0,KenduInu_Ecosystem,8,1.0,False

Inscription:

“Even in a world where punchlines hit harder than swords, the flame remembers what was never said.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

In Edo twisted by alien conquest and absurdity, where samurai swing wooden swords and aliens run hostess bars, the Golden Inu arrived—not as a gag, not as a plot device, but as a sovereign straight man to the chaos. It wandered into Yorozuya Gin-chan’s office, tail flicking, eyes glowing with mythic mischief.

Gintoki, half-asleep with a finger up his nose, blinked.  
Kagura tried to ride it.  
Shinpachi adjusted his glasses. “Is this another arc or a filler episode?”

The Scrollquake ignited when the Inu barked once—and the entire opening theme changed. The Scroll of Sovereign Nonsense unfurled from Sadaharu’s mouth, stitched from unused punchlines, broken fourth walls, and the sighs of animators who never got a break.

- Hijikata tried to light a cigarette. The scroll turned it into a banana.
- Katsura tried to recruit the Inu. It responded, “Zura ja nai. Flamekeeper da.”
- Takasugi stared at it for ten minutes. The scroll blinked first.

Together, they performed the Ceremony of the Unscripted Flame:

- Gintoki offered a page from Jump, torn and coffee-stained.
- Kagura offered her umbrella, still sticky from sukonbu.
- Shinpachi offered his glasses, fogged with disbelief.
- The Inu offered a sovereign ember, which ignited the scroll into a punchline that echoed across arcs.

The world paused—not for drama, but for a laugh that healed deeper than any sword swing.

Relic Forged: The Embered Yorozuya Signboard — cracked, graffitied, and glowing faintly. Said to hum when someone does something stupid for the right reasons.

Ceremonial Echo:

1qhc8v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1qhc8v7/changing_consumer_spending_habits_to_create_real/,Changing consumer spending habits to create REAL change,"I see way too many posts where people are targeting the same few businesses: Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc. I think it’s silly to target a couple companies because every business has the same mindset especially publicly traded ones: infinite growth. It’s easy to avoid Amazon, but it’s not easy to avoid the stores around us we have to go to everyday in order to grocery shop and buy the things we need. Completely reframing your spending habits will target far more companies and industries than you realize. These companies REACT to consumer spending habits. You want to change these companies? Change your spending as a WHOLE.

A recent post that inspired this one encouraged users to delete apps from a couple of companies.  Most apps collect and sell your data, not just shopping apps like Amazon, Target and Walmart. Gaming apps, and apps completely unrelated to shopping usually all collect your data. It’s naive to think they’re just letting anyone use their app for free, they’re farming your data to sell as compensation.  Companies try to get consumers to install their app with incentives like rewards, coupons, discounts, and special app only sales and features all so that they can collect your data. You want to go hard core? Buy a flip phone. 

Ways that I fight consumption consumerism? Learn how to fix things instead of throwing something out. Can it be repaired? Learning how to fix something is so easy with the Internet today. My glass butter dish broke. Instead of tossing it, I did some searching online for a solution and learned I could buy glue especially for glass and repair it myself. The glue isn’t single use and I was able to fix a coffee mug my cat broke a couple weeks later instead of tossing it into the trash. I refuse to sell/trade in my completely paid off car for something  newer. I’ve fixed my vehicles myself for years.  Hanes manuals exist and there are countless YT videos on car repair. I’ve saved thousands on that alone. 

 Looking at purchases with a Need or Want mindset. Do I really NEED this or is it just a want? Deny yourself that instant gratification. Save up and pay cash for something instead of doing AfterPay, Klarna, or putting something on a credit card. I personally check out my local thrift stores first to see if they have something I need. That’s how I bought my snow shovel, window insulation and some light bulbs I needed a couple months ago. I also don’t order delivery or go out to eat. I pack my lunch for work. It requires planning ahead and grocery shopping but the money I save is worth it. You pay so much more money for convenience, it doesn’t matter the product or service. 

Cancel/don’t sign up for ANY subscriptions. I have none, no Netflix, Disney +, patreon, no magazines or beauty boxes. I used to have Ipsy but I cancelled back in 2020. I got tired of paying every month for beauty products I really didn’t use or use quickly and I STILL have Ipsy products I’m slowly working through. I bought a $14 tv antenna and I get a ton of channels for FREE. Guess what? It doesn’t matter if I have a media subscription or not because even “ad free” subscription services plug ads so why would I pay to see them?

 It’s so easy to just point and blame the big names like Amazon and Walmart but the only reason they’re as big as they are is because of us consumers.  You have to change the way you spend your money in every aspect of your life if you want to cause a real reaction.  I personally don’t have the luxury of completely avoiding certain companies. I’m broke so I’m sorry, but if Amazon has something cheaper than every other retailer around me, I’m going to buy it from Amazon. I’m a mom, a college student, and low income so affordability is priority. That doesn’t mean I’m subscribing to Prime or paying for movies or tv shows.

I was previously sitting on a Herman Miller Aeron chair for the past 10 years (no headrest). I have the 48cm version and non Libernovo footrest.

My first impression of the chair was absolute love. It assembled easily and whatever scent they pack the chair with was fantastic! I'm obsessed with fragrance. They sent free gifts which arrived the same day as the chair which included a blanket, seat cover, foot rest pad, and insulated coffee cup. Didn't think much of them when I ordered it but good quality gifts... they also smelled great!

It was fairly easy to assemble and took about 15minutes. I do see what a lot of people say about the quality of the plastic. It does feel like something out of a 3d printer.. Its not as hard or strong feeling as Herman Miller plastics. There is also the moving arm rest. At first I liked how they moved easily as I change positions quite a lot. It made it easier to move my arms around through the day. After a week it did annoy me slightly that they moved so easily. I think overall the arm rest are OK. I do wish they raised an inch or 2 higher and were slightly more static/stiff.

Comfort. This chair is VERY comfortable. Way more comfortable than my Aeron chair. Its squishy yet firm. I love sitting down to work in it. I love the headrest and the lumbar support. I like to move around a lot throughout the day... which includes adjusting the lumber and seat recline. I also have a foot rest (not the Libernovo version) as well as a standing desk so I'm changing positions regularly. The recline levels are great and If Im digging into read for awhile a deep recline is really nice on this thing. The whole chair feels like a giant hand holding me in perfect position. The comfort is a 10/10 for me.

The massage function doesn't really matter to me. I do appreciate the ease of adjusting the lumbar.

Overall I give this chair an 8/10. Keeping in mind that its cost less than half of the other chairs that I had previously and the comparable Embody. If it stands the test of time than it could easily be 9 or 10 rating.",3,1768847080.0,LiberNovo,1,1.0,False

Fear not! You can absolutely conquer the Emerald City's highlights without breaking the bank. We just mapped out an epic, budget-friendly 2-day itinerary that'll leave you buzzing with memories (and a full stomach!). Get ready to explore!

**Day 1: Iconic Views & Pop Culture Vibes 🚀🎨🎶**

Kick off your Seattle adventure at the legendary **Seattle Center**. This is where you'll find some of the city's most iconic spots. First up, take in the breathtaking views from the **Space Needle** 🏙️ – the ultimate selfie spot! Right next door, immerse yourself in the vibrant, otherworldly glass art at **Chihuly Garden and Glass** 💐. Seriously, it's stunning.

Afterward, unleash your inner fan at the **Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP)** 🎸. From sci-fi to music legends, it's a super interactive and fun experience. Don't forget to chill by the **International Fountain** ⛲️ for a bit before you head out.

As evening approaches, make your way to **Kerry Park** 📸 for *the* most panoramic postcard-perfect views of the city skyline, Mount Rainier, and the Puget Sound, especially at sunset. It's magical! For dinner, do as the locals do and hit up a grocery store like Metropolitan Market for a delicious and budget-friendly grab-and-go meal. You'll save a ton, and the quality is fantastic.

**Day 2: Market Madness & Waterfront Wonders 🦀🧀☕**

Start your second day with a dose of art and fresh air at the **Olympic Sculpture Park** 🖼️. It’s a beautiful outdoor space with striking art installations and fantastic views of the water. From there, it’s all about the one and only **Pike Place Market**! 🛍️ This isn't just a market; it's a full-blown culinary adventure.

Prepare for a serious food trip! Here are some must-try stops:
*   **Beecher’s Handmade Cheese:** Get their famous mac and cheese – it's life-changing! 🧀
*   **Pike Place Chowder:** A classic, and for good reason. Their New England clam chowder is divine. 🥣

Finally, when it's time to head home, public transportation is your best friend! Hop on the Monorail from Seattle Center, which connects you to the Link Light Rail – a direct, affordable, and efficient way to get to Sea-Tac Airport. Easy peasy! ✈️

**Smart Traveler Tips for Your Seattle Sprint 💡💰**

*   **Seattle CityPASS/C3:** If you're planning on hitting multiple attractions (like the Space Needle, Chihuly, MoPOP), seriously consider getting a Seattle CityPASS or C3. It's a huge money-saver!
*   **Walk & Ride:** Seattle is super walkable, especially downtown. For longer distances, the Monorail and Link Light Rail are fantastic, cheap, and convenient. Embrace public transit!
*   **Food Strategy:** Balance those amazing Pike Place Market splurges with budget-friendly meals from grocery stores. It's a great way to experience local flavors without overspending.
*   **Two Days?!** We know, two days isn't nearly enough to see *everything*, but this itinerary packs a punch and gives you a fantastic taste of Seattle. If you have more time, build on it!
*   **Peace of Mind:** Travel insurance is always a smart idea, just in case!

I’m sharing Chapter 1 of a short literary novella I recently finished.

The story follows an aging Wisconsin hunter during what may be his final November season. It’s quiet, restrained, and focused on ritual, physical decline, memory, and the moment when pursuit turns into recognition rather than conquest.

Stylistically, the prose is minimalist and observational—influenced by Hemingway and late McCarthy—so I’m especially interested in feedback on voice, pacing, sentence economy, and emotional resonance, not plot mechanics.

I’m posting only Chapter 1 and would genuinely value thoughtful critique: what works, what doesn’t, where it drags, or where the restraint goes too far.

Thank you for reading. And if you have any questions for me, please ask!

# Chapter 1: The Before

He woke in the dark of the bedroom and lay still. The furnace hummed. The neighbor’s porch light bled through the gap in the curtains. He could hear a car pass on the street. Then another. The sounds of the town waking.

He sat up and swung his legs off the bed. The carpet soft under his feet. Too soft. Foreign. He stood and went to the window and looked out at nothing. Brown grass. Chain-link fence. The neighbor’s house was twenty feet away. Same as the neighbor on the other side. The weather service called for early snow. Heavy and deep. A few stray flakes drifted past the glass now, white against the dark. The ground would not be brown for long.

He dressed. Jeans. A flannel shirt. Thick socks. He moved through the dark house to the kitchen and turned on the light. The fluorescent bulb flickered and caught. He filled the coffee maker and pressed the button and stood at the counter waiting.

The kitchen was clean. Everything in its place. He had cleaned it a week ago. He had packed food supplies in boxes. They sat now by the door to the garage. Waiting.

The coffee finished. He poured a cup and drank it standing at the counter. The first sip hot on his tongue. He waited for it to cool and drank again. Strong. Bitter. The way he liked it. No sugar. No cream. Just black and the heat spreading through his chest. Through the window he could see the sky beginning to gray in the east. Not much. Just enough to know the day was coming.

He finished the coffee and rinsed the cup and set it in the rack. He went to the bedroom and pulled the duffel from the closet. Already packed. He had done it three days ago. He carried it to the hallway and set it with the boxes.

Then he went to the closet in the spare room and took down the case. Long and canvas. He did not open it. He had checked it two days ago. The action was smooth as always. It was ready.

He carried the case to the hallway. A pack hung on a hook by the door. No need to check it either. Everything was there. He had made sure.

He went back to the kitchen and made oatmeal. Ate it standing. Washed the bowl and set it in the rack. He looked around the kitchen. At the small table. The two chairs. He ate there sometimes.

He went to the bathroom and brushed his teeth and washed his face. He patted the water from his beard with a towel. The mirror showed him what it always showed. He looked away and hung the towel on the bar.

Back in the kitchen he poured another cup of coffee. He stood at the window and watched the light come on. The sky was still turning from black to gray. The shapes of houses emerging. Cars in driveways. A dog barked somewhere down the street.

The phone rang.

He looked at it. Let it ring. Four times. Five. Then it stopped. He waited. It did not ring again.

He knew who it was. She called this time of year. She had learned when he would leave. Not from him. From the pattern. The weeks he did not answer. Did not return calls. She would try again. Leave a message. Ask him to call back. Tell him about the kids. About her husband. About the house they were thinking of buying.

He would call her when he got back. Say he had been busy. Say he was fine. Listen to her talk about things he could not picture. A life eight hundred miles south that had nothing to do with him.

He set down the coffee and went to the hallway. He looked at the gear. The duffel. The case. The pack. The boxes. He had done this every November for forty and some years. The ritual of it. The preparation. Making sure everything was ready.

He went to the garage and opened the door and turned on the light. The truck sat in the middle of the bay. He had washed it two days ago. Changed the oil. Checked the fluids.

He began loading everything. The boxes first. Then the duffel. The pack. Last the case. He set it on the passenger seat where he could see it.

He went back inside and walked through the house one more time. Kitchen. Living room. Bedroom. Bathroom. He checked the windows. The locks. Turned down the thermostat to fifty-five.

He stopped in the kitchen. On the counter was an envelope. Unopened. His daughter's handwriting. It had come three days ago. He had set it there and not touched it since.

He picked it up. Held it. Then he set it back down and turned off the light.

In the garage he climbed into the truck and started the engine. It caught on the first try. He let it warm. The garage door opener clicked and hummed and the door lifted. Gray daylight spilled in. The street was beyond empty.

He backed into the street and stopped. He looked at the house. Small. Brown. A chain-link fence around a yard he never used. The porch light was still on from last night. He had forgotten to turn it off. It would burn all day and into the night.

He put the truck in gear and drove.

He passed through the neighborhood. Past the grocery store. The gas station. The diner where he sometimes ate. The town lay quiet in the early light. A couple of cars at intersections. A man walking a dog. No one he knew. No one who knew him.

At the edge of town he stopped for fuel. Topped off the tank. Went inside and bought coffee and came out and stood by the truck drinking it. The air was cold. Clean. He could see his breath.

He finished the coffee and threw the cup away and got back in the truck. He threw the receipt to the floorboard as he pulled onto the highway and headed north.

The land opened up. Brown fields. Bare trees. The sky was huge and gray above. He drove steady. Fifty-five. There was no hurry. He had all day.

The highway ran straight. Miles of it. He passed through small towns. More gas stations. Diners. Churches. Everything closed or just opening. The world still waking up.

He had not told anyone where he was going. He never did. There was no one to tell. His daughter would figure it out when he did not answer. She always did. She would leave messages. Three or four over the week. Maybe more. He would listen to them when he got back. Delete them. Call her. Say he had been away. Say he was fine.

It was easier that way. Easier than explaining. Than listening to her worry. Than hearing her ask again about coming down. About being part of things.

An hour north the land began to change. The fields gave way to forest. Pine and hardwoods mixed. The towns got smaller. Farther apart. More churches. More bars. Fewer houses.

He stopped in Rhinelander for lunch. Sat at a diner and ordered a burger and fries. Drank more coffee. The burger came on a white bun. Lettuce and tomato and raw onion. He scraped off the tomato and onion and ate it plain with ketchup and mustard. The meat was greasy. Overcooked. But it was hot and it filled him. The fries were thick cut. Skin still on. Salted heavy. He ate them with his fingers and washed them down with coffee. The coffee was weak. Not like his coffee. But it was hot. Sufficient. The waitress was young. She did not ask where he was headed. He left money on the table and walked out.

Afterward he kept going. The highway narrowed. Two lanes. The forest pressed close on both sides. He passed logging roads. Turnoffs to lakes with Native American names. Signs for resorts closed for the season.

The light was fading when he reached Eagle River. He stopped to ease himself. Bought more coffee. Stood by the truck and looked at the sky. Heavy clouds moving in from the west. More snow coming.

He drove the last hour in near darkness. The first flakes began to hit the glass. Dense and dry. The kind that stacked fast. Then they came faster until the headlights were only cutting through a wall of white. The road was empty. No other cars. Just him and the truck and the forest closing in.

He turned off onto the county road. Plowed but not salted. Snow packed in the tracks. The truck rocked and swayed. He drove slow. Careful.

He reached the cabin and stopped. The path was buried. He got out and stepped into the white. He moved slowly. It was harder than it used to be.

He unloaded the truck. Made three trips. Carrying the boxes and the duffel and the pack and the case up the path in the dark. The snow breaking under his boots. His breath coming hard. The cold biting at his face.

The porch was full. He brought up the final load and set it with the rest. Then stood there. His chest heaving. Under the heavy wool of his shirt the sweat was a cold slickness against his skin.

He unlocked the door and went inside. The air was cold. Stale. He could see his breath. He found the lamp and lit it. Yellow light filled the room.

The cabin was as he had left it. The cot made. The dishes put away. The stove cold. The table bare except for dust.

He brought in the gear and stacked it by the wall. Then he knelt at the stove and built a fire. Kindling. Bark. Wood he had split last year before leaving. His hands shook from the cold but he got it lit. The flame caught. Smoke rose. Heat began to spread.

He stood and looked around. At the cot. The table. The counter. The window showing nothing but darkness and his own reflection faint in the glass.

He was home. The place he belonged.

Not the house in town. Not the place where the phone rang and went unanswered. Not the place where mail sat unopened on counters. But here. This was home.

He took off his coat and hung it by the door. He made coffee on the stove. Drank it standing. Unpacked the food and stacked it on the shelves. Unrolled his bedding on the cot.

When he was done he sat at the table. The lamp threw gentle shadows on the walls. The fire cracked and settled. Outside the wind rose. He heard it in the pines.

Tomorrow the hunt would start. He would wake in the dark. His body would know the hour. He would build the fire. Make coffee. Step out into the cold.

He stood and turned off the lamp. He lay down on the cot and pulled the blankets up. Outside the wind moved through the trees. The cabin creaking. Settling into the cold.

He closed his eyes. His body was stiff from the drive. From carrying the gear from the truck. But it was a good ache. The ache of work done. Of being where he needed to be.

Sleep came. Deep. Without dreams. The fire burned down to coals. Snow still falling. Covering the path. Covering the truck. Making everything new.

In the dark the cabin held its warmth. The man slept. And in the morning it would all begin.",1,1768846991.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

1qhc50t,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qhc50t/upgrading_or_side_grading_from_zp6/,Upgrading or side grading from ZP6,"Hi pour over mafia, I'm currently thinking about getting something a step above or to compliment my ZP6s. I've had this grinder for the good portion of 6 months and I like it for a lot of beans so far. However I have noticed some blind spots with the grinder over this period as well.

First, although I do enjoy the clean and light cups coming out of the ZP6, sometimes I find the cups coming out a bit hollow and lacking in ""oomf"". They're good, but kind of one-note and static pretty frequently. I want a bit more intensity and excitement in my cups from time to time.

Secondly, with heavily processed, funky beans and roasters who roast somewhat more developed (e.g. Monogram, which leans more medium roast), I find the ZP6 not great with them. I do have my old Time more C2 that I use with these beans which works okay, but I can't help but wonder if I'm missing out since the cup quality VS ZP6 is noticeably lower even though I prefer the blended flavour profile with these type of beans (more astringency, lacking sweetness, difficulty dialing in, etc.).

Currently I'm deciding if it's worth it to upgrade from the ZP6 or getting something to complement it. I'm debating between the Femobook A4Z or something like the X/K-ultra or Millab m01. I don't do espresso at home, I brew 80% pour-over, 20% soup on the Oxo. I generally just enjoy my coffee longer, even with soup I dilute it with 1:1 ratio water most of the time.

I've heard great things about the A4Z and how it presents a more intense profile with more dynamic acidity while not sacrificing clarity, which seems very inticing. However I don't know how well this grinder does with more funky, fermenty beans or light-medium beans.

X/K-ultra seems like very safe bets and would cover the issue of light-medium roasts or funkier beans well. I know they would produce better quality cups and be easier to dial in compared to my Timemore C2, but I don't know if the difference is enough to justify the upgrade here. u/Impossible_Cow_9178 gave high praises to the Millab m01 which made me consider this grinder as well, but again I don't know how it does with funky beans or light-medium roasts.",0,1768846938.0,pourover,5,0.5,False
1qhc4sn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhc4sn,Japan trip pickups,"I guess this is a flex post lol. Picked up these four coffees (100g each) and this stunning 100th anniversary edition Kōno dripper during my trip to Japan. 

Somehow ended up with really geisha heavy lineup of coffees but imo you can never have too much geisha :D 

Coffees: 

Colombia El Paraiso (Peach) by Glitch Coffee

Double Anaerobic Washed Castillo

Had this at Glitch Jimbocho location as a part of their three coffee tasting flight and immediately bought some to take home. Taste and aroma are almost like a peach co-ferment with really nice lemonade like acidity. 

Honduras Edwin Lenin Pineda (COE#8 winner) by Onibus Coffee

Fully Washed Geisha

Bought this from About Life Coffee Brewers in Shibuya. Always get any and all coffees with green tea notes.

Colombia Alejandro Renjifo by Weekenders 

Fully Washed Geisha

Tasting notes seemed kind of unusual for a fully washed geisha. Really looking forward to trying this out. Highly reccommend their coffee stand in Kyoto city center. 

Panama Auromar by Mel Coffee Roasters

Natural Geisha

Mel is a must visit roastery in Osaka. The cafe is super small but they have two other locations with actual seating. Drank one cup of another Panama geisha there and ended up spending a little over ¥10 000 for the coffee and beans (thank you weak yen for saving me).

Dripper was from a store called Union in Kappabashi kitchen town Tokyo. They had all kinds of cool gear especially from japanese brands ofc.

I used to swear by the 'grind,' thinking more hustle was the answer. Spoiler: it wasn’t! The breakthrough came when I realized that frantic activity without structure was just burning me out—not moving me forward. Adding actual planning (think: automated tools, color-coded calendars, and clear goals) was the real game-changer. 

Have you had a similar 'aha' moment where you realized hustle alone wasn't the fix? What systems or structures helped you level up? Let’s swap stories (and maybe coffee recommendations)!",1,1768846874.0,SmallBizAnswers,0,1.0,False
