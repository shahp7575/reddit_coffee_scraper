Hello all! 

My bf and I have been together a couple of months, things have been a little bit rough for his side because of his job and he don’t like the city we are living in but I won’t go into that much of details.

A month ago while he was WFH, a message from a girl popped up from his laptop, he told me it’s a girl he met while he’s abroad living in a co-living apartment ( we were together already but doing long distance), which that girl was one of the “flatmate”, he told me she basically thinks he’s a friend and she tends to over shared a lot of crazy story of her life to him ( like shes a sugar baby and still has an bf living across another continent etc etc) I brushed it off but i remembered her name back in mind. Few weeks later over lunch, he told me that this girl texted her again with some crazy story in her life to him, my face started to changed and my bf sensed it, he told me if messaging her makes me uncomfortable, he will stop messaging her because according to him, she’s irrelevant to him.


Things move forward to 2 days ago, while he was showing something from his laptop, this girls message popped up again and it crossed the line to me because he said he will stop messaging her and still kept it ongoing behind my back, my trust is basically broken and I told him I cannot move forward with this relationship.

We talked for 2 more days since we are living together, I asked a lot of things about this girl which he finally shared with me:

- he thinks she’s attractive 

- they’ve been messaging almost on daily basis, but non of them are flirty from his side according to his standard, sometimes she will send a selfie to him and asked if she’s hot, my bf said he replied : you’re hot 

- when he was abroad, he went out with this girl alone for a coffee without telling me because from his point of view, it was just a friendly coffee with a flatmate 


He’s been crying a lot, both of us actually, i felt like he broke my trust, but he does trying to reconcile, how can i move forward on building the trust again on him? 


TL; Dr- my bf has been messaging a girl behind my back after saying he will stop, how do we move forward from this",1,1734084611.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Long time lurker, love u guys so much, u always make my day, and I want to ask the community for some advice on a dilemma I'll be in soon.

This is gonna be a bit of a long read so strap in.

  
So a bit of backstory, my (20 F) Great Grandmother (GGM) has 3 biological children, my Grandmother (GM , 78 F, recently passed), Peter (76 M) and Paul (74 M), names have been changed for anonymity. 

The thing is my GGM had my GM out of wedlock, back in 1946 in a small farm community, shortly after the birth of my GM she found the man she would marry and had my GM two younger siblings.

My GM was belittled as a child growing up for not being my GGF child, so she acted out and well, she ended up getting pregnant at the age of 15 and had my farthers older sister at the age of 16, lets call her Beatrice (F 62).

My GGM an GGF, did not approve of my GM actions, but they neither wanted to listen to the townsfolk who wanted to ship Beatrice of to a place never to be seen. So they decided to send my GM away to fend for herself, at 16. She moved to the city and started to work wherever she could at different bars and bodegas to make ends meet. 

She lived this way until se found my bio grandfather and had my father (Rasmus, M 55) and uncle (Ruben 53). My bio GF dipped when my uncle was 2 and my father and uncle started to stay with my GGM when they had breaks from school so my GM could earn money, there they met their older sister, whom they never really talked to before.

Their relationship is far from good, and they only just begin to mend bonds now, after the recent death of my GM. In short my Aunt resented my father and uncle for getting her moms attention, whom she never really got to know, and my father and uncle resented her for being ungrateful for living a life where she didn't have to think about money at a very young age.

But what does this has to do with me? Well my GGM passed around 2 years ago, for the last 5 years of her life, we would drive 2 hours down to see her on Christmas day, and eat  common Christmas treats from our country, with my GM, and older cousins (whom I get along with just fine) and drive back home to celebrate Christmas eve the same day. For the last 2-3 years my aunt started to join us at the 24th but there were always a bit of tension between her and my GM her biological mom, because she would call GGM for mom and my cousins would call GGM for GM.

When GGM passed she left a ring to my GM, that she always wore, she literally NEVER took i t off, but my aunt was mad about this because she wanted the ring, and wasn't satisfied with inheriting on the same level as GGM's bio children. So she had a hissy fit and cut contact completely with Peter, who told her she couldn't have the ring, and went low contact with Paul. 

My GM had told my GGM before she died, that if she (my GM) got the ring she would, never as in never ever give it to Beatrice, because not once has she called her mom, or tried to mend the gap between them. She would instead give it to her oldest biological granddaughter (that being me). She gave me this ring 3 months after my GGM passing through my father, I did not at first know that this was THE ring, because GGM always wore gloves, yes above her rings, even indoors, so i couldn't tell at first. 

Well i paid 445 DKK for getting this ring completely cleaned and valuated, it is a 8 or 16 K (I don't remember) gold ring with a lot of small white gems in it, the biggest gem being a real gem and the rest lab grown. I do not know what his ring is worth money wise but it holds a lot of sentimental value for me, but I guess it also does for my aunt.... For contexts no one in my family except my mediate family knows that I own this ring, at least not to my knowledge. 

Now to the present time, my GM passed a little over 2 weeks ago, a bit suddenly, and my father was in charge of planning the funeral and calling up all the family members, and inform them of her passing. Everyone except my uncle Ruben who has been estranged from GM for the last year, came to the funeral. 

My aunt who never really talked to my GM stood and wept for 15 min straight by her coffin in the church, to the dismay of Peter and Paul, but no one said anything. After the church ceremony we went to have coffee and cake at an inn and my aunt chose to sit away from the rest of the family, and leaving after 45 min or smth.

  
I did not directly hear he ask about the ring, but my father talked with her about inheritance which she does get, and she apparently brought up GGM ring, but dad just dismissed it saying they could talk about it when they have sold her house, and have to split everything.

So my question is, would i be the buthole for keeping this ring, which I paid for to get rinsed and have worn for the last two years?

Should I give it to my aunt because I know she wants it, or should I uphold my GM wish of me having the ring. A bit of context it is a fairly small ring, and my GM wasn't able to where it, and neither would my aunt be able to, but it fits me perfectly, and i really loved GM, and I was the only one who visited her often, I would drive to her (2,5 hour each way) every 2nd or 3rd month since I got my drivers license at age 18 the only other person visiting her this often was her late husbands (not bio GF) daughter, but he doesn't want the ring or care.

So dear community what do I do? I find this so hard to navigate because no one is without fault in all this messy family drama.",1,1734084609.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

1hd93sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hd93sg/you_were_everything/,You Were Everything ,"You were my life. I gave you my all. I held you as you cried, I consoled you as you told me about your past traumas, even as it began to take a toll on me, I was there for you every single second. We both grew together, we were both teens without a plan. I grew because I had you in my corner. I started the gym, I changed my life from a wondering aimless teen to a driven ambitious man with you. I tried to bring you with me, I really thought that I did for a while, even as you continued to drown yourself no matter how hard I pulled you up. 

We were happy, we really were happy together. We talked constantly, we were inseparable. I stood by as you made mistakes, I stood by as you changed your plans multiple times, no matter how wrong I thought them to be, I supported you after making my feelings clear. I really thought this time was it, when you got accepted for tech I was beyond proud of you. 

Then you told me one day you didn't know if you just liked girls or not. I was heartbroken and devastated, and I gave you your time to decide. 

You let me keep my promise to bring you to your first day. You gave me this look after I said something loving, I thought it was a realization that you had decided to be with me. But it was really an ""oh shit"" look. You cheated on me. It wasn't a spur of the moment thing driven by alcohol, you told me this lie about being confused about your sexuality to cover yourself. You turned off your location. You took the time I gave you to decide and used it to cheat on me. You went out multiple times with someone, you fucked them once that I know of.

I dragged the truth out of you after phoning you while you were out with him the same day I brought you to tech. I was broken, and hurt. You were emotional, you were regretful, you were.. I'm not sure how you really felt. You sent me paragraph after paragraph, you told me ""You know I'm the one who loves you the most"" you told me ""I can see us growing old together"" you told me ""I will do anything. I will literally sell my body every night just for you to forgive me""

And you know what? I believed you. I really did believe you. 

I took you back, I took you back. Every person I knew and had told about what happened told me not to. I ignored every single one of them. I could care less what they thought, you were the one for me.

We had a good three weeks I think. One of my conditions was therapy for your need to lie, but from my perspective, it just seemed like a way to come after me. Every time you came out, I'd get shit. Every time.

Then it boiled over. We argued. I refused to back down and so did you. You ignored me for a day, and broke up with me the following day for my ""controlling"" behavior.

And then you went out with the guy the next day.

A guy who is worse by every metric, and not in a bad boy type of way


I pushed too hard, I know that. I shouldn't have pushed so hard for you to come to the gym, for you to do this and to do that. I know that, but not one single thing I did was for my own self interest. I wanted you to be able to look in the mirror without crying, I wanted you to go a week without being sick because of you being underweight. I wanted you to see yourself the way I saw you. 

It's not fucking fair that I had to be your parent and boyfriend. It's not fair that your mother has no parental instincts, it's not fair that I had to fill in for her. It's not fair your dad isn't in the picture. It's just not fucking fair for either of us.

I was going to marry you. I was going to have kids with you, the image of our kids with your eyes haunts me.

I clinged on after you broke up with me, and I'm embarrassed by it. I told you you were dead to me in anger.

And today, I finally gave up my dream of getting you back, of pulling you out of the water. I asked to meet, you said you couldn't. We had a nice conversation over text, you told me in another reality we were meant to be. I'm not sure how to feel. I blamed your mum, I blamed your friend, hell I blamed your fucking therapist. But today was confirmation that it was you in control, it always was and always will be. 

I have to accept that I can't help you, I have to accept that you need to learn these lessons without me. You left tech after leaving me, I'm not sure how long after leaving me it was, but I was so disappointed when I found out. Then I see you awake at 3am morning after morning. 

That's what I think hurts me the most, the disappointment. I could manage if I knew you were having a good life, but from what I know, you aren't. If I was offered a deal for you to have a good life, but without me, I would take it in a heartbeat. It would be devastating, but I would do it. Because that's what love is, and I'm not sure you really ever understood that. 

I just don't feel much of anything right now. I had this thirst for blood for him since it happened, and now, it just isn't there anymore.

Odds are you'll never see this, but there is nothing in this world that can't be fixed, there is nothing in this world that I wouldn't do to fix it all, to be in your arms again, to look into your beautiful eyes and hold you.

I would single handedly conquer the world for you, and you wouldn't even meet me for a coffee.",1,1734084369.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

","To start, I just want to say that I want to get this off my chest and greatly thank everyone that's been on my side including you for listening to my raging story that in the grand scheme of things, probably isn't that deep and I was too much in my feels. I'm upset about it and disappointed in this person but I think largely, I feel pathetic and upset at myself for not cutting it off sooner despite all the signs available, but an ode to love and all the whacky and wonderful things it makes us do. In spite of this, it is beautiful that I am capable of these emotions and to feel hurt, betrayal, grief, sorrow, admiration, and infatuation over perceived love after some-time of not feeling this at all. 

I (25M) was pursuing someone (33M) for about 3 or 4 months. We matched on Hinge randomly in August and he messaged me with a dorky message that I was very much into, he kept me rizzing me up and I was into it and then no response. I suppose given the world of online gay dating, this wasn't too uncommon but damn I wanted him to message me back. 2 weeks go by and I still didn't get a response from him so I initiate the conversation again and we exchange Snapchat usernames (I know...bit of an ick but I was into him so I tried whatever I could to get a hold of him) and the chemistry just feels right. At this point, he mentions that he lives in a part of the country that I want to move to after I graduate in about a year's time and he finds fascination in that. We exchange phone numbers and I try to loosely arrange a meet-up for the next day and he agrees to it. I was working in a rural part of the state (which I very much didn't enjoy but that's a different story for a different day - just alone, depressed, missing my dog, and the list goes on) and came back to the city every weekend or so, so I was looking forward to seeing him but around the time of the scheduled date, I didn't hear back from him. At which point, I message him about it and he apologises stating that he had forgotten because of work and that he is keen, wanting to meet up in the future. I took it at face-value then because why would he lie? I think I was wrong hehe. 

So a week goes by and I re-initiate the conversation, asking to see him in-person and he agrees to it. I ask if the weekend works for him, to which he says no because he's flying out to another state to care for his sister so we settle on Thursday. At this point, my expectations were quite low and I was already let down by him so I just agreed so that I could communicate what I was feeling and cut it off. I didn't necessarily want to ghost him as I thought that people deserve some basic respect. I was still working in the country town so I drove back a day earlier - to see my dog but also in the slight chance that he would message me - I saw my dog but I didn't hear from him so I drafted a really nice message basically saying that I got the impression he wasn't into me and that's chill (I mean we hadn't even met in person at this point and I didn't really know him, he didn't really know me either so I was into him more than I should've been) but upsetting as I was really into him. Instantly, I get a text back from him apologising, stating that he forgot again because of work, that he was into me but the times just didn't work out and that he looks forward to when I move up to his home-town so that we could and I quote ""fall in love"" to which point, I was a bit weirded out as we couldn't even meet up when we were in the same town let alone ""fall in love"" in a different town. Trick ass. 

So that's the story when it should've ended. Right? Wrong. I'm a dumb ass. 2 weeks have gone by and at this point, I was 2 weeks into a new rotation at my job. I had deleted Snapchat once we exchanged phone numbers and on this particular day, I had re-downloaded Snapchat in the library just to talk to one of my many long list of lovers (it's a joke, they're my mates and maybe like 2 actual lovers who I sporadically contact) during quite a boring day and I see a photo from him, and I decide ""eh why not?"" so I video call him and I wasn't expecting a response. He answered and I remembered why I was in too deep too quick, the chemistry is really chemical. So we re-commence talking and I decided to give him a second chance. We start talking again and he mentions that he feels bad about not meeting up and that was because of work, and he's going down part-time so perhaps we could meet in the future, he's coming down to my home-state in the next month for a friend's wedding so maybe we could meet up. I was into the idea because I was into him. 

In addition, to work in the town (where he lives) that I want to work in, I needed to at least have spent some time in that state doing a placement so I lined up a placement over the summer (now) and I suppose spending some time in the town where a boy I was into lives would be somewhat sweet. I never had a summer fling so I thought it would've been a cute romantic time on top of lining up my career goals which were independent of him from the get-go. I inform him of the placement and he mentions that he's excited to spend some time with me over the summer. 

Although we've video-called on Snapchat once before, we hadn't actually called and on the weekend, he calls me and we chat for an hour or two while he's driving home from wherever he was out in the country. During this phone call we chat about life, our perspectives, our politics, what working in the same field looks like as two non-white people and how that comes with its own unique set of challenges, past relationships, and he drops the fact that he wasn't interested in anyone else since breaking up with his ex about a year and a half ago and that he wasn't talking to anyone else. He also mentions that he doesn't use Snapchat that much and he would prefer to talk on text - I mean he initiated talking on Snapchat first but I welcomed the idea of just texting normally.I thought it was a bit of an over-share but found it endearing nonetheless. I stayed on the call until he got home and then I left the call once he was safe. Anyways, the next day - it's radio silence for another week or two but at this point, I felt safe and secure in the connection and just thought that he was busy - I trusted what he said at face-value because why would someone lie to a complete stranger that they've only spoken to online? I still believe what I said but and big BUT, there are some WEIRD people out there. I can understand how some people get swindled, these swindlers are great! 

Communication is quite dry and I'm initiating most of it for about a month at this point but I used the thought of hanging out with him to get through exams. After my first exam, he calls me as he's shopping for pants for the next weekend and he mentions that he's excited to see me. I thought it was cute but as he's shopping for pants, he asks for my opinion on one particular pair and I mention they look good on him to which he replies ""good because I'm hoping to pull next week."" I was thrown off by this comment and figured it was a weird thing to say to someone who was quite explicit and honest in that he was romantically pursuing and only interested in you but I let it slide. Why? Because common sense was running but I was running faster. And then this is where I was weirded out because he mentions that he had a pair of pants similar to the ones he was purchasing but his ex now has them. He goes silent for 5 seconds and then ends the call...Big ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. But I still call him later that night (because I was deeply interested in him and I was deeply stupid), I try to make a funny nerdy joke but he explicitly calls me ""dumb"" and ""that I'm going to be shit at my project next year."" I let it slide again...Why? Because I thought it was hard to find genuine romantic connection as a gay man and this was the first time I felt this way in a long time and my boundaries of respect and tolerance which are usually quite high, were tempered with temporarily because I would put myself through this because of my feelings. And I was a dumb ass. Anyways, I try to get a conversation going but he just hangs up on me with no mention of  reciprocity of contact. Guys...Guys...Guys, I was hurt. So I hit up my homegirls and my homeboys and I just talk about it, I come to the conclusion that this person is a weird person and his comments really threw me off, the best thing for my emotional sanity would be to cut it off. And I did just that. 

Anyways, he contacted me the next week when he arrived to my home town. And by contact, I mean that I woke up in the morning to 10 missed calls from essentially, a mean stranger who wasn't over his ex. I giggled to myself as he texted me ""wake up you f@#knut,"" going back to sleep humoured. I woke up to 3 more missed calls 30 mins later, and just replied with ""woah relax,""  then proceeded to shower. In the shower, he rang me twice and did I answer? Nah, I was over courtship. But being the great and gracious person I am (kidding), I rang him back and this is how the conversation went: 

*""Hey, did you call?""* 

*""Yeah, I tried calling you a bunch of times""* 

*""Yeah, sorry I was asleep""* 

*""Okay, I'm in your city! How are you?!""* 

*""Yeah I'm stressed.""* 

*""Why are you stressed?""*

*""I've got exams soon.""*

*""That's lame.""*

*""Yeah. Where are you now?""*

*""I'm just by the trains. I need to get to where I'm staying. I'm staying with a mate in a suburb but he works from home and I just can't see him right now.""* 

*""Okay cool.""*

*\*silence for 5 seconds\** 

*Me: ""okay so um what are you doing tonight?""*

*Him: ""I'm grabbing dinner with my cousin. Why?""*

*""Okay that's cool. I thought maybe we should meet up but that's chill.* 

*""Well, maybe if you answered my calls then we would've met""* 

*""Um okay lol...I'm gonna go study now""* 

*""Yeah I'll let you go""*

*""Okay bye.""* 

And that was that. I didn't see him, he didn't see me that weekend. And I thought it was the finale. But I also largely played a huge part in my own destruction because it gets messier...I text him the next week asking if he was in my home-town (I knew he wasn't going to be there) and he told me that he left. Look, in hindsight, I probably should've not texted him but because of how immature I acted and I wanted to keep him in my radar, I did the do and now I am a Looo-ser. Oh well. 

Hats out of the bag now, I am no longer in my feels over this asshole and he contacts me sporadically over the next few weeks asking if I'm in his home-town yet, sending me what I assume were sexually provocative topless photos that would've enticed anyone except for people with normal vision and I just thought how pathetic is this man. And I kept it very friendly and casual, 

As you can tell, I was in a good headspace relating to this. On the day that I was due to fly interstate for this placement, he messages me out of the blue asking to pick me up. I thought it was sweet but I didn't want anything to do with him so I said no. And then he texted me asking if I was sure. I said yes. And then he tried to convince me to let him pick me up, and I said I'll think about it. An hour goes by and as I was leaving the house, he rings me asking me to send the flight details. I told him that I'll call him back, I'm busy as I was getting to the airport. At the airport, he texts me mentioning that it'll cost $50 to get a 10 min cab to the city, and I mention that it's okay, I didn't want him to pick me up and I would just figure it out. He asks why I'm being avoidant in my communication...a bit rich coming from him. I lied for the sake of niceties when I should've been truthful saying that I had a big weekend and I just wanted to get to my accomodation with no issues. Finally he ceded, and I said...great, I'm done with that. 

The next day, it's my first day at this new centre and I find it great - you know when you have that rose-tinted view of everything when you first start something new whether it's a new job or a new activity or a new hobby. I get a text in the middle of the day from him asking me how it is and I respond with that it's going good, and he replies with ""great, I'll show you around the city after work."" And because I was very much filled with dopamine at the new job, new location, new city, I agreed to it. At this point, shit hits the fan and it is humorously messy. I really don't like blurring boundaries but I guess this is human life, and part of being human is accepting the chaos and sometimes being the chaos (within reason of course). 

We hang out and I tell him I only think of him as a friend now, the communication is shit, and he's said some harmful things to me. He apologises for them and we leave it at that. Anyways, totally incongruent with that, we go back to his place and we cuddle. It was sweet and very confusing because despite all the online interactions, in real-life, I still very much liked him despite all that he's said and done. And to be frank, he hasn't really said or done anything extremely outlandish - just behaviours that hurt me whether he was conscious of them or not, nonetheless, it proved to me that we weren't compatible per se. But my heart was still beating for him as I am a certified lover boy in my core. He mentioned that he felt safe around me while we were cuddling and I thought that was sweet. I said I hope he always feels safe around me. And from then on, I was unfortunately enthralled. 

We hung out one more time in-person after that and spent about 4 or 5 hours together but I found this time to be weird. Mind you, this is the second time we've hung out and whilst it's largely good, he calls me a fuckboy and a sl\*t, and that if we were going to be together, I would go back to my home town and cheat. I immediately call it out and say that it's weird he has this view of me and that he's missing a lot of steps in between us ""being together"" like discussing what a relationship would look like between us, the boundaries of that relationship, and I ask him why he would say such weird things. And look to be fair, I think his response was honest which was essentially that he was insecure and he thinks that I'm a 10/10 and that he's ugly in comparison. I replied with a ""that's your problem that you need to work on and you should see someone about that because I don't cheat in relationships because of past trauma."" And he says that that's fair and c'est la vie. 

Whomp whomp whomp. In 2 days' time, I get sore balls - orchitis is the medical term for that - and I've had sore balls before from an STI so putting 2 and 2 together, I thought I got an STI from him as I didn't sleep with anybody else but him. Only thing is we hadn't had sex, we just cuddled. I messaged him asking when his last STI test was and what were the results, and he asks if I gave him something. I told him that I thought he gave me something and then we talked about it and I thought it was all clear. I went to go get tested and my results were all clear - no STI or UTI so I thought great. 

I texted him over the next week asking if we could meet to which he initially said sure, and when I asked to see him later that night, he said to me that I was aggressive and accused him of giving me an STI and that hurt him, to which I apologised and tried to see it from his angle but genuinely couldn’t understand how I was being aggressive nor accusing him of giving me an STI. I asked to call him but he kept saying he was busy and I respected that. The next day, I tried to call him but again he told me he was busy but it seemed to me that he was being avoidant. I asked him if there was any particular reason as to why he was being avoidant and he told me that he was just busy. I simply told him then that the avoidant communication makes me feel anxious and I just wanted to talk but he didn’t give me an opportunity to do so, so I didn’t want to pursue this any further. He responded with “all good.” And that was that. 

I’m trying to make sense of it all and I can’t really understand how messy it got but I got a missed call from him at around 5:37 AM and I asked him if he called, he said “sorry it was a butt-dial.” And I took it at face-value. I was trying to reason with all that happened and my actions but, and I promise I’m nearing the end of this story, but I drove to where he lived and called him. In that moment, I thought that if he weren’t to answer, I would just drive off but if he were to answer, I would ask to speak to him face to face and if he consented, then we would speak in person. He answered, we spoke in person, I told him that I tried to shake these feelings off but I really like him and I want to see where this connection would go. He told me that he thought I was aggressive in my communication and he doesn’t deal with aggression well. I told him I didn’t like the avoidant communication style and that was that. He also told me that he was going to go to my home-town to visit his friends and his cousin that weekend and we should go out for a drink when he gets back to which I welcomed the idea. 

He comes back 4 days later and I pick him up from the airport. All seems well. I drop him off at home, we kiss, and then the next day, I ask what he’s doing, he tells me he’s at the beach and I ask if I can come. We meet at the beach and whilst vibes are initially stand-offish at first, we manage to talk and things seem well. He tells me his friend is visiting him from my home-town and that he’s staying with him, and that he forgot about it until the day before his friend arrived. He’s a bit anxious about his friend visiting him. I had a suspicion so I just asked if it was his ex and he tells me yes it is his ex. He’s anxious because he’s unclear if his ex (side note, they broke up a year and a half ago and he’s friends with all his exes) came with an ulterior motive or if the same ex who he’s described as abusive and manipulative is just his friend visiting him. That’s cool, exes can be friends and that’s not an issue but I ask him if he is going to cuddle and kiss his ex - he lets out an exasperated “God, no - I don’t like messy things, and I have clear boundaries with friends.”  I then ask him if he’s emotionally available - I can’t remember if he said yes or no, but he asked me why I was asking him these questions and I told him directly that I was interested in him and romantically pursuing him and so I want to know if he’s available and if he likes me pursuing him because otherwise I’ll stop. He tells me that he’s not sure if he likes it yet, he’s trying to figure me out. The conversation drifts into something else and then eventually we head out of the coffee shop. He drops me off at my car and whilst he drops me off, I tell him that it’s a shame his ex is visiting him as I probably won’t see him again. He tells me that’s not true and that we should get a drink later tonight. I respond with “I’d like that, I’d like to get to know you more but whatever happens happens, I think you’re special,” and he replies with “I think you’re special too.” And we leave it at that. 

And that was that. There was no message from him about meeting for drinks (which I knew based on his previous communication style), no message in the next few days, and I’m hurt by it all. It’s a shame that these 2 weeks have been a whirlwind but damn, it was a beautiful experience. I feel as though we could’ve been something beautiful. I left it at that and there’s been no communication since because I don’t think it’s fair on my mental health to be constantly reaching out to him to hang out, if he wanted to, he would reach out but he doesn’t want to and that’s okay. 

I recognise this is an assumption that I’m making but a part of me thinks he’s still attached to his ex. Based on what he’s said: “*my ex has my pair of pants…I have to go now”, “you’re going to cheat”*; based on his actions: letting his ex stay with him despite fearing for “ulterior motives,” the flakiness at the start, the flakiness now when his ex is in town. But I recognise it’s an assumption as well, so it could be true or it could not be true. My gut tells me that he’s a genuine human being, he’s neurodivergent based on my interactions with him, and he has an avoidant attachment style. All could be true, none of it could be true, but what is true is how his (and my) actions have left me feeling vulnerable and hurt. 

I really like him, I still do - I guess it’s hard when you’re a queer person of colour to find someone you genuinely like and I found him, but I don’t think that he likes me in the same way that I like him - and that’s his prerogative. But damn, I wish this went different.

This has been a saga and a half, hey. I said I wanted a summer fling and I think this is the most drama that I’ve had my entire life. Dating sucks. I’m still in his city until tomorrow night. I wonder if I should message him just to reach out one more time before I never see him again. ",1,1734084094.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

To be better prepared for exams, students must learn to study smarter, not harder. Here are some of the study habits that can help students excel during exam season.

# Get rid of distractions

Yes, this includes your phone! If technology is nearby, it can be difficult to stay focused on your task. Putting your phone on “do not disturb” until the end of your study session is a great way to avoid distractions.

# Take exercise breaks

Try to be active every day. Getting some fresh air and going for a walk can do wonders for the mood and brain! Studies show that being active releases endorphins in your body, helping you stay awake and focused. Gentle exercise before or after studying also improves your mental processing. This means that you may remember more information when it's time to take your exam.

# Change your environment

Don’t study in the places where you usually rest, like your bed. Find a space that motivates you to study better. Consider what you need to better concentrate. Are you easily distracted if there are a lot of items on your desk? Do you need a fresh breeze to stay alert? Try going to a coffee shop, library, or public garden. It can also help to surround yourself with people that are doing a similar task as you.

# Find the method that works for you

Don’t wait until the last moment to cram everything in. Try to learn material by spreading it throughout the semester. Take practice tests and ask your friends to quiz you before your big exam. Watch YouTube tutorials on topics that you don’t understand. Move at your own pace, and make sure to check your knowledge along the way.

# Reward yourself

Studying can be exhausting, especially during exam season. It is important to reward yourself for your hard work! One way to do this is to set goals for yourself. When you achieve a goal, treat yourself to something special that you enjoy. This could be watching an episode of your favorite show, going for ice cream, or doing a fun outdoor activity. Even during a stressful time, it’s important to take care of yourself. You’ve earned it!

1hd8ysa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1hd8ysa/yall_need_to_regulate_your_emotions/,Y'all need to regulate your emotions,"Y'all need to regulate your emotions

I wrote this originally as a reply in another subreddit but I think in the manifestation community we need it desperately.

There's no conscious manifesting until you regulate your nervous system. Emotional regulation is one of these things that you didn't think you need until you started manifesting. Next to self-love and self realisation that you are, indeed, all there is.

To all of you who are anxious, impatient, unhappy, reactive, I got you. And I've been there too. I went from anxious to happy almost all the time. I smile constantly, I wake up with a smile, I fell asleep with a smile. Not because my manifestations come true. But because I AM.

I went from unhappy and pessimistic, Murphy's law believer, anxious, with many more bad days than good days to a peaceful person who no longer has bad days - merely ""bad"" hours that turn into a nice day in the end. 

EMOTIONS ARE MEANT TO FLOW FREELY THROUGH US. And the happy ones do: they come up, we feel them without analysing why they are here or blaming others. We just feel them. But we don't handle the negative emotions in the same way. We look for causes, we analyse, we blame others or our circumstances. All that is wrong because it only deals with the symptoms and not the root cause which IS YOU. You are the projector, 3D is the screen. You don't change the screen if you don't like the movie. You change the projector settings instead.

HOW DO I REGULATE MY EMOTIONS?

With the letting go method. Here's what you do.

1. When emotions come, you don't suppress or repress them. Let them come in. Identify them. Name them. There might be many at once so deal with one at the time. If you start feeling like it's uncomfortable or stupid, this is the resistance, which is another emotion on top of emotions. Don't resist the resistance. Name it, embrace it. Locate your emotions in your body. Where do you feel them? Your chest? Jaw? Shoulders? Belly? Emotions manifest in our bodies.

2. Sit with the emotion for as long as you feel it. Focus on the emotion itself and feeling it. Ignore the causes, stop analysing who or what caused it, stop blaming others. Shift the focus fully to your inner world. Just feel. Cry if you must. Don't suppress anything. Accept it. Don't try to change the experience in any way or judge anything. Be there for yourself.

3. Let go if the emotion(s). Just move your attention to something else. Feel the relief. Feel the lightness. It's gone for now. You did well ❤️‍🩹 

4. Ask yourself, what can I do to make myself feel better now? And then just do it. A nap, a walk, a coffee to go, visualisation session in meditation of your wish fulfilled. Whatever it is. Do it.

Doing it once won't be very effective. You must do it every time a negative emotion comes up. It will take you 10-20 minutes at the time each time. But if you continue this way, they will eventually run out. Each time weaker in their strength until you no longer react to them. Suppressed emotions can linger in your body for years. 

WHAT WE FOCUS ON GROWS. So, when you feel emotions and you focus on the external, this is what will grow - more of the triggers and reactions you had so far. But if you focus on yourself, feeling, dealing with everything at the source (which is you), this ability to handle all that comes your way without strong reaction will grow. Where do you spend your time the most I such situation? Your time = Your energy = Your focus = Your power. Don't give it away so easily.

LOVE YOURSELF ENOUGH TO DO THIS

SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN

When you release the emotion, the thoughts and states that are undesirable are released too. Don't do it the other way around because it won't work. The quality of thoughts follow the states, not the other way around. Emotions that linger in your body block your full expression of love, abundance, fulfilment, bliss - which is your true nature and flows freely if we remove the blocks. Blocks that are the unprocessed emotions, often in our bodies for years if not decades.

Todo list for all of you who want peace:
+ Identify your limiting beliefs. Ask chat gpt for journaling promots that will aid this process.
+ Meditate twice a day for ay least 15 minutes. Preferably IAM meditation or self-enquiry.
+ Focus on yourself unapologetically for a while. Make your meditation and emotional regulation NON-NEGOTIABLE.
+ Observe yourself throughout the day. What's your dominating state of dwelling? Where do you focus your attention in? Self-observation IS KEY. Know yourself.
+ Dwell as awareness, rest as awareness whenever you can. In meditation, when you wait for something, throughout the day. BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD. Repeat to yourself: I am. I am. I am. Feel it. Be the impartial observer of the thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions - all of this changes. The I am does not.

1hd8sne,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaughAndLearn/comments/1hd8sne/how_to_study_effectively/,How To Study Effectively,"# Determine Your Learning Style

The first step to becoming an effective studier is to determine what type of learner you are. Everyone is different, but knowing whether you respond better to hands-on learning or visual cues can give you a starting point to help you discover strategies that fit your lifestyle. Studying is a habit you can build, but it’s easier to start working *with* your natural tendencies instead of against them. 

Check out the chart below to learn more about different learning types.

# Get Organized

A disorganized schedule only compounds stress you might have from your responsibilities outside of class. Start on the right foot from day one and invest in a planner or notebook where you can keep track of deadlines and responsibilities throughout the semester. 

Schedule study sessions early on. If you’re reviewing material bit by bit as you learn it, you’ll have less studying to do once exams come around.

# Take Notes in Class

Unless you have a photographic memory, you’ll never remember everything said during class. Even if you think you won’t need notes to remember the material, you can’t travel back in time if you forget a topic.

Writing notes is a great study tip and can also help you digest and remember the course material better. If you have trouble paying attention, sitting in the front or volunteering to be a class note-taker can help hold you accountable.

# Set a Schedule To Avoid Cramming

Last-minute cramming for a test isn’t just stressful — it’s also less effective for long-term learning. Knowing how to study effectively includes setting aside a little time each week so the work doesn’t pile up as the end of the semester approaches. Create a schedule and stick to it.

Take into account your personal schedule and how you focus best. If you’re an early riser, review some notes over your morning coffee. If you’re a night owl, hit the books on a day when you’re usually not too busy.

# Hold Yourself Accountable

Sometimes, studying is better with a friend. Whether you create a small group or just have one study buddy, knowing someone else is relying on you makes it easier to sit down and do the work.

Try assigning different topics to different group members, where each person is responsible for becoming an expert and helping other members understand the material better. This makes studying a more collaborative process. 

# Be an Active Reader

Do you ever find yourself reading your textbook but not actually taking anything in? That’s called passive reading. On the other hand, active reading is one of the best ways to study effectively. Here are a few common ways to turn reading a textbook into a more active activity:

* Take notes in the margins or write in a notebook
* Highlight the text
* Write outlines to summarize each chapter

Other active reading strategies include writing outlines, drafting practice presentations, or creating concept maps based on the material.

# Create a Productive Workspace

Just like everyone has their preferred study method, everyone works best in different environments. Some might study best in a busy coffee shop, while others prefer being alone in their room. 

Finding your ideal workspace takes some trial and error. Consider switching up factors like:

* Noise level
* Seating arrangement
* Break frequency
* Time of day

# Ask Questions

Don’t be afraid to ask for help from teachers, mentors, and even other students while you’re studying. Sometimes, a second explanation or a different perspective is all you need to get your wheels turning.

When you have a question, whether in class or studying on your own time, always write it down right away. This way, you won’t forget it, but you can also continue listening to the lecture or studying until you’re able to get an answer. 

# Quiz Yourself

Practice tests and quizzes are a valuable study tool that can break up longer study sessions and help you identify knowledge gaps. Quizzing yourself every so often reveals what topics you‘ve mastered and what you should spend more time on.

Whenever you feel stuck or a little bored with studying, a quick quiz can help you re-engage with the material and track your progress.

# Avoid Multitasking

Multitasking is tempting, but research shows over and over again that it’s not effective. Try these strategies to cut down on distractions and focus on one task at a time:

* **Keep a to-do list** handy where you can write down distracting thoughts.
* **Use the Eisenhower Matrix** or a strategy that helps you prioritize tasks and be more productive.
* **Schedule regular breaks** ahead of time to cut down on multitasking temptation.
* **Change study environments** to avoid distractions.",1,1734082926.0,LaughAndLearn,0,1.0,False

At first, I thought it was just friendly gestures—a coffee here, a small gift there. But then his friend confessed that he’s liked me for a while, even back when I was with the first I guy I am talking about. He said he never acted on it out of respect for his friend but can’t hold it back anymore. He is kind, genuine, and attentive—everything you’d want in someone who’s interested in you.

On the other hand, I’m worried about the complications it could bring—both for their friendship and my past with the first guy. So here I am, stuck in this emotional maze.

1hd8ogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hd8ogl/deja_vu_and_dreams_has_been_making_me_feel_insane/,Deja Vu and dreams has been making me feel insane. ,"I (25F) am married (27M) for over a year now. Awhile back I had a dream that felt so real. The type of dream that you wake up from wondering where you’re at and how you ended up back in bed. The dream started with my husband driving on the freeway and I’m in the passenger seat. It was sunny out and felt like summer. A red car in front of him slammed on its brakes. He didn’t brake fast enough and ended up colliding hard into the back of the red car. Next thing I know I’m floating above the accident. The sun is so bright and it’s hard to see. But I get the strongest sense that I’m not dead. But my husband is. That I wasn’t actually in the car with him and instead I watched how he dies. I woke up crying and startled from it. It just felt so real. 

Deja Vu and dreams is something that messes with me a lot and always has. I always write down my dreams in a journal and date them. I’m fully aware that dreams are just your brain playing crazy situations over and over…that the odds of something happening is fairly common. But the best example I can give is one I had back in 2018. I was dating someone named “David”. David and I had been together for over a year at this point. One night I had a dream of waking up in a bedroom that wasn’t mine. I hear a man’s voice asking me if I’d like a cup of coffee. His voice made me feel safe and comforted. I replied back “Yes, please!” My now husband who I haven’t even met yet comes around the corner. Sits next to me holding my cup of coffee. Kisses me on the forehead and says “Good morning my love. Did you sleep alright?”. I wake up…again feeling confused as to where I’m at. Where did he go? Where’s my cup of coffee? I realize it was dream. I write down what I dreamed about immediately and even sketched my husbands face. 

Having things like this pop up in my day to day life is something that just fucks with me deeply. I don’t know if I’m going crazy or my brain is just playing so many different tapes that eventually it gets it right. But since the car accident dream I’m terrified of it actually happening. I’m mean hell I dreamed of us together before even meeting him. If there’s a red car on the road (especially next to the HOV lane) I will immediately try to move out of the lane. As soon as I get that Deja Vu feeling I think about it and check up on him to make sure he’s okay. But that Deja Vu feeling keeps happening more and more…summer is right around the corner…I just feel like I’m loosing it. ",1,1734082374.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that can brighten your smile and boost your confidence. Many people see impressive results when they undergo treatment, often sharing their ""before and after"" photos online. But what can you realistically expect from teeth whitening, and how can you maintain those dazzling results? Let's explore the impact of teeth whitening, what to expect during the process, and tips for keeping your smile radiant.

When considering teeth whitening, it’s essential to understand how the process works. Most whitening treatments involve a bleaching agent, usually hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, that penetrates the enamel and breaks down stains. This results in a noticeably whiter appearance. Before you start, here are some important points:

- **Consultation:** Always consult with your dentist first. They can provide insight into the best whitening option for your teeth and overall oral health.
- **Realistic Expectations:** Results vary depending on the treatment and the individual. Some may notice a drastic difference, while others have more subtle changes in color.
- **Shade Guides:** Dentists often use shade guides to show you your starting point. This way, you can see your teeth’s color before and after treatment.
 
A common question during the whitening journey is, ""What should I expect immediately after treatment?"" Many people experience some degree of sensitivity after whitening, particularly with in-office procedures. This sensitivity is typically temporary and should subside within a few days. Additionally, your teeth may appear a few shades brighter right away, but keep in mind that it can take multiple treatments for optimal results.

 Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
If you're using at-home whitening kits, the timeline might differ. Some people notice results within a few days, while others may require a couple of weeks. To maximize the effectiveness of your at-home treatment:

- **Follow Instructions:** Stick to the recommended use schedule. Overusing products can lead to increased sensitivity and potential damage to your enamel.
- **Consistent Use:** Make it a routine. Consistency is key to achieving and maintaining the brightest results.
- **Track Progress:** Regularly take “before and after” photos to monitor your whitening journey.
 
After achieving your desired results, maintaining your bright smile is crucial. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

 Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush twice a day and floss daily to remove plaque that can dull your teeth.
2. **Whitening Toothpaste:** Use a whitening toothpaste to help maintain brightness, but be cautious of excessive use, as they can be abrasive.
3. **Diet Considerations:** Limit foods and drinks that can stain teeth, such as coffee, tea, red wine, and sugary snacks.
4. **Touch-up Treatments:** Schedule touch-up sessions with your dentist or use at-home kits periodically to keep your teeth looking bright.
5. **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water, especially after consuming stain-causing foods or beverages.
 
In the days following whitening treatments, many people also notice their teeth appearing slightly gray or dull. This is often due to dehydration of the teeth. To mitigate this, it’s wise to avoid any staining food or drink for at least 48 hours post-treatment. After this period, reintroduce them slowly into your diet while keeping your whitening strategies in mind.

Ultimately, the before-and-after experience with teeth whitening can be a rewarding journey. With the right preparation, reasonable expectations, and diligent aftercare, you can enjoy a bright, confident smile. Regular check-ins with your dentist can also ensure your whitening remains effective and safe, guiding you toward optimal oral health.

 Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Your journey to a whiter smile doesn't have to end after the treatment. With a few thoughtful steps, you can keep your confidence high and your smile bright for months, or even years, to come. So, prepare yourself, get ready for that stunning before and after, and let your smile shine!

Understanding Different Teeth Whitening Methods: A Comparison of Effectiveness Before and After Treatment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic treatment that many people consider to enhance their smiles. With various methods available, it’s essential to understand how each one can affect your results. In this article, we’ll explore different teeth whitening methods and compare their effectiveness by evaluating the before and after results.

### Professional In-Office Whitening

One of the most effective ways to whiten teeth is through professional in-office treatments. In this procedure, a dentist applies a high-concentration bleaching agent to your teeth and activates it with a special light. This method is known for its immediate results, often brightening teeth several shades in just one session.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
**Before and After:** Patients typically notice a significant difference immediately after treatment. Many report that their teeth appear up to eight shades whiter. The results can last anywhere from six months to two years, depending on lifestyle and care.

### At-Home Whitening Kits

At-home whitening kits include trays filled with a mild bleaching solution that you wear for a specified duration each day. While these kits can be effective, they generally take longer to produce results compared to in-office treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Pros:** Convenience and cost-effectiveness.
- **Cons:** Results can vary, and it may take a few weeks before you see a noticeable change.

**Before and After:** Many users find that after a few weeks of consistent use, their teeth can appear up to six shades whiter. However, results depend on adherence to the instructions and the specific product used.

### Whitening Toothpastes

Whitening toothpastes typically contain mild abrasives and chemical agents that help remove surface stains. While they can brighten your smile, these toothpastes do not change the natural color of teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Efficiency:** Subtle improvements for surface stains.
- **Limitations:** Results are gradual and often less dramatic than other methods.

**Before and After:** After using whitening toothpaste consistently for a few weeks, you might notice your teeth are brighter. However, don’t expect dramatic changes—most users see improvements of only one or two shades.

### Over-the-Counter Whitening Strips

Whitening strips are thin, flexible plastic strips coated with a whitening gel. They are easy to use, often only requiring applications twice a day for about two weeks.

- **Effectiveness:** Many users report good results in a reasonable amount of time.
- **Accessibility:** Available at most pharmacies and supermarkets.

**Before and After:** Users often see their teeth brighten by four to five shades after following the treatment protocol effectively.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Remedies

Some people prefer to use natural methods, such as baking soda or activated charcoal, to whiten their teeth. These methods are often considered safer and are inexpensive.

- **Advantages:** Budget-friendly and may promote oral health.
- **Disadvantages:** Results can be limited and inconsistent.

**Before and After:** While some users see a subtle difference, significant whitening is usually not achieved. Most natural remedies tend to brighten teeth only by about one shade.

### Laser Whitening

Laser teeth whitening is another advanced method that uses laser light to enhance the effects of bleaching agents. Results can be immediate and very noticeable.

**Before and After:** Many find their teeth are several shades whiter immediately following the procedure, with effects lasting up to two years with proper maintenance.

Teeth whitening methods vary significantly in their effectiveness and results. Your choice will depend on personal preference, budget, and the desired degree of whitening. Professional treatments typically yield the fastest and most dramatic results, while at-home methods offer convenience and flexibility. Understanding the differences before starting treatment can help you achieve that bright smile you've been dreaming of.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly enhance your smile, boosting your confidence and providing a radiant glow to your appearance. Understanding what to expect before and after treatment is crucial for achieving the best results. Factors such as your dental health, the method chosen, and aftercare all play a role in how white your teeth can become.

Exploring different teeth whitening methods, from professional treatments to at-home kits, reveals a spectrum of effectiveness. While professional treatments typically yield the most dramatic results, at-home options can still offer noticeable improvements when used properly. Each method has its merits, but be sure to consider your lifestyle and dental needs when choosing the right one.

Maintaining your newly whitened smile requires ongoing commitment. Avoiding foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, practicing good oral hygiene, and possibly using touch-up treatments can keep your smile bright for longer. With the right approach, the “before and after” results can become a lasting transformation, leading to a smile you’ll be proud of.

By understanding the process and making informed choices, you can enjoy the benefits of a dazzling smile for years to come.

1hd8kcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hd8kcq/i_need_some_mature_advice_about_relationships/,I need some mature advice about relationships,"Hello,   

I'm 22 years old man, recently I broke up with my girlfriend of 1,5 years due to, I thought, differences in character. There was no big fight, no betrayal nothing.    

She constantly gave me cold shoulders for seemingly no reason at all, but it was because I did not give her the attention she needed. So in short I did not call, text or cuddle enough and she then in return would give me cold shoulders about ridiculous things like me not getting her a fork along with a meal I cooked and got her.  

There were other differences in character like me being ambitious and doing well in college and having a job on top of that and her not passing her exams at all and not even trying hard to find one and so I was constantly pressuring her to find a job or learn and she was mad that were not instead just cuddling watching TV and such

My parents thought I was unhappy cause everytime I brought her over she was mad at me despite me seemingly doing everything right (dates, cooking food, bringing her coffee and presents) and so they kinda pressured me into breaking up because I deserve so much better. It seemed like the right decision, only thing I thought was special were..I'm sorry for honesty but the amazing sex. Something I know I wouldnt be getting from another girl in the same manner but I thought whatever I can settle for some 'normal' sex if it means I can find somebody equally ambitious and not as needy.

Outside of that we loved each other, she looked perfect, liked the same music, same movies, same food and wanted a similar future. We went on dates every week, we cooked together...it seemed like honeymoon phase never ended.

Now 3 months after I broke it off I'm having doubts. I don't really feel lonely, I just feel like it was a bad decision. We don't talk, I don't know whats up with her but we didn't return each other's stuff yet and 3 months ago she called me and said she'd like to come and pick it up, I said I'll mail it, I didn't and so it's a little gate to start it all over.     

Now my question is do you think I should come back despite my parents not liking her anymore and saying I deserve better, my little brother saying I'm just desperate and my brothers gf saying I can find somebody else easily and shouldn't try to rebuild something that didn't ever work in the first place.  

I just feel like there wasn't that much wrong between us besides lack of communication, and misunderstanding. and it's not just the sex I miss despite my previous assumptions. My ""love language"" is getting her stuff and helping out with work and studies and she just needed affection and attention and I feel like that could have been, and maybe still can be fixed. But maybe I should just let it go and look for another person? I don't know. I'm just sure that she actually loved me and wanted me for me and sure I can find somebody else that does but it's not so easy, and why search for somebody else when there already is such a girl...I don't know. Help.

So basically I get pain most days, always by the end of every day because using the toilet, walking, standing, sitting, bring on pain. Flares stop me being able to walk and use the toilet etc. It sucks! I'm on a lot of meds. 

As I've posted on here before (but it's been a few weeks!) my ex ended things with me about a month ago and I've had to start managing myself as he removed most of his care/help to me. Those hes been helping me move and checking in every few days to ask how I am etc and if my pain is okay. 

I'm proud to say that this is going a lot better than I thought it would! At first, my world caved in and I was overwhelmed, scared, about how I'd cope. I had awful flares that resulted in me having to crawl (no longer walk) and a few near hospital admissions. Before the break up, id had some meds messed around (love pain management) and started physio/rehabilitation that focused on upping physical activity fast. My physios sacked me/fired me after my meds got messed around as they couldn't work with me due to increase muscle spasms (GP tried to remove dizapem without guidance from anyone) and my pain management team reduced one of my pain meds that was helping with inflammation in the day and soreness. 

I lost a lot of weight (around 6-8kg) and stopped being able more than 2 meals a day due to muscle spasms and was largely housebound again. Now here is the crazy part. After I got dumped, I went down to 1 meal a day and a fortisip, back to flares that left me crawling on floor, unable to walk. But something changed. It was as if my body/brain went into survival mode. I used to be very active and into fitness before my surgical injury that gave me chronic pain, in the early days of recovery I had to use my right side first, as my brain had lost the connection almost with my left side of the body. I'd lost confidence in myself and my body and got anxiety going out Incase I got pain. I was too scared to stay with friends and felt very isolated. My mental health suffered as a result. 

Since the break-up and removal of care, my pain has become more manageable. I still have pain, like I'm sitting in a hot bath because I have neuropathic pain this morning. But I know I'll be okay. I've done so much more walking, a bit of lifting, I've had a fall and brought on a flare and managed it myself, got back up to 3 meals a day (only small but progress), I've got abs again from lifting and sticking to my pelvic floor stretches, I have arm muscles again!? I've travelled up to see friends on the train twice. Gone out drinking at bars (always end up first one home due to fatigue), meals, coffees with friends. Driven cars! (Rental ones as don't have my own, but still!), stayed in airbnbs, packed my own meds and medical equipment, said no sternly to people who pushed to see me when I was in a flare, asked for help at train stations from staff. I just feel so much more confident, like recovery is possible and I can do this. 

I never realised how much of a mental link of having someone doing something for me, and losing confidence to do it myself would make my pain feel worse. It's still there, I'm still in pain. But I'm growing to feel connected to my body again and learn to tell myself it's okay. I just wanted to share that as I'm really happy with this ATM after a year of absolute hell with a nerve injury!

Lost it while I was sleeping last night.  I feel blindly underneath my bed for it and my glasses.  Try to brush the dust from its slimy surface before I give up and bring it to the sink to wash it off.  Put it back.  Get dressed.  Brush my teeth.

Around midday, my intestines come out.  In the daylight they shine like wet black and purple and red worms.  Blood coats my palms as I shove them back inside.  I’m running out of hand sanitizer- should go back to the store at some point.  Can never seem to keep enough.

I want to go home and lay down, but I have a meeting in an hour, and this world doesn’t care about what I want.  I cough out a lung fifteen minutes before.  That’s a bit harder to deal with.  Have to enter through the hole in my side and push through spongy muscle on the floor of my chest- think it’s the diaphragm- until I reach the space where my heart sits.  I feel the beating of it- too fast, thready and diseased.  Should probably see the cardiologist again.  Last time I went they said it was fine.  It’s all fine.

Anyway.  Lung’s back in.  Still hard to breathe.  I go to the meeting.  Try to ignore the way I have to constantly press on my side to keep my innards in.

When I lay down again, finally, it’s with the knowledge that I shouldn’t be laying down.  I have work to do.  I should be working.  Instead, I find myself melting into fetid bedsheets, flesh sloughing from aching bones.  

In the morning I’ll pick my skin back up and wrap it around myself like a funeral shroud.  I’ll get up, check that all my pieces are in place.  Make my coffee.  Drive to work.

We got kinda lit and wanted to go to the club so we were going thru our male friends list on snap to see if any guy could drive us downtown and tag along. We contacted 2-3 guys until this guy i had on snap i asked him if he wanted to hang he said yes came over. He took me and my friends out. We mostly drove no club idk why. It was also pretty late like 2 am. Anyways when we got home, my friend invited this guy for coffee in the house. We were all im her room on her bed cuz she has a double. Anyways when i was laying he was next to me. So i randomly cuddle him. Like snuggle up against him. When i was snuggling and hugging him in bed i was on my side. I then pug a leg up across his leg under the blanket. And then started feeling a little horny so i wrapped my body against his knee and started grinding on it. I did that a few times then would stop and until later i kept grinding on his knees and he would push it more. This went on for a bit. I also had a a friend sleeping next to us when i did that, I hope she didnt know what we were doing. But then eventually all 3 of us we got up and went to go eat in the kitchen and talked about the day etc. Then after i ate we went back to bed cuz we were so tired. The guy was also sooo sleepy. So after i ate i cuddled up against him and he cuddled me up. I started doing the knees thing again after a while of debating if i should or not but just by being in close proximity i was a little horny. I kept grinding and my face was covered with my hair and his sweater i felt like i needed air so i turned my face the other way towards him. When i did that the second time for air idk our mouths were kinda close so we started kissing. Then idk i just grabbed his hand and put it on my pussy from outside the clothing. So he started rubbing my pussy. And then stuck a finger in my hole. We kissed like that. Then i told him lets go upstairs (cuz my friend was sleeping). He said ok and as we were going he was like i cant beleive i got to kiss you. So we went and layed on the couch and kissed, then i put his hand back inside my tights to play with my pussy. He started rubbing fingering so much. I kept moaning. He covered my mouth hard and said shhh you cant make any noise. There was also a dude in the kitchen (prob my friends housemate) and a few other ppl that would walk past us. Everytime they did we would stop and pretend were sleeping in a spooning position. He kept saying “FUCKKKK” , “UR SO HOT”. Like  saying to himself over and over. And kinda slighty groaning. He finger fucked me so hard. Put his finger in all the way prob to my g spot. I kept moaning. And said he wants to do so much more and that if we werent here he would put it in me. Idk which part but i was moaning so much i started calling him daddy. Like “yess daddy right there”, “Oh yesss”, “Or even just daddy😩daddddyyyyy”. I even grabbed his hand and put his other finger in my mouth and started sucking it. He kept going like “fuckkkkk baby”, “Ur so hottt” And put his finger in my throat. I was sucking his finger like a cock. Told him to kiss my neck etc. Then idk after we got up went downstairs. When we were going down the stairs he said i didnt expect this from u. Probably because I look innocent and like a good girl and every time ive met him i never did anything with him not even hug. Anyways, I had to pee so i went to the washroom. My pussy was soooo soar and kinda red. I peed and we both came into the room my friend was sleeping in. Then i asked her if i can shower. She said yes. So i grabbed my clothes she gave me a towel and went to shower.

TLDR: I want to buy a Rocket R58, and I want to hear contrary advice. 

I’m in the market for a new dual boiler coffee machine. Currently have a Breville Barista Express, and hoping to start making more espresso, better espresso, and more milk based drinks as well. 

I mostly drink medium roast espresso currently. I enjoy experimenting with light roasts at my local cafes, and I’m open to getting into that for home. 

I’m drawn towards the Rocket as my first choice. I’ve got three friends with Rockets, and they love them and I’ve enjoyed using their machines and they’ve been very happy. They also have a bit of a thing with the cycling community, and I’m sure that’s a big part of my positive impression of the brand. 

I’m after a rotary pump (ideally for plumbing in after my next renovation), and a dual boiler.

Some alternatives that I’d consider at a similar price point include:
- Lelit Bianca - don’t love the style despite the good price point
- Profitec Drive - looks quite a bit bigger than the Rocket, and would end up costing me quite a bit more
- ECM Synchronika - as above
- LM Linea Micra - tempting upgrade pick but a big price jump for me and not sure that it adds much value for that extra cost. 

My local sells all of these, and the guys in the shop think buying a Rocket isn’t a crazy choice given my thoughts. 

I’m fully aware that I’m investing in a hobby rather than trying to rationalise my choice. 

Given all of that I’m keen to hear from people telling me I’m making a bad choice. ",1,1734081176.0,espresso,2,0.67,False

I’ve been using an Ascaso Steel Duo PID (Version 2) for two weeks now, and overall, I’m quite happy with the machine.

However, I’ve noticed something: after extraction, my coffee puck is always wet on the surface. I suspect this is because some water continues to drip from the brew group after I stop the shot.

To investigate, I ran a test without the portafilter. I noticed that after stopping the water flow, around 3g of water still drips from the brew group.

Here are my questions:


Have you observed something similar with your Ascaso Steel Duo PID?

Could this be the reason for the wet coffee puck?

Is this dripping behavior normal for this machine, or should I have it checked?

Additional recipe details:


Coffee dose: 18g (IMS 18g Competition basket)

Brew ratio: 1:2.5

Extraction time: ~30 seconds

Pressure: Steady at ~9 bar

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Specialita

Beans: Light roast

Puck-to-shower distance: I performed the coin test, which shows a distance of ~3.5 mm. Despite this, the puck always sticks to the shower screen after extraction.

The taste of the espresso is good

Looking forward to hearing your experiences and thoughts. Thanks a lot! ☕️

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The popularity of gift cards continues to soar, creating a significant impact on consumer spending habits. You may be wondering, how many people actually buy gift cards each year? Data shows that millions of consumers purchase gift cards annually, and the trend is on the rise. Understanding the impact of gift cards on consumer spending requires a closer look at who buys them and what motivates these purchases.

In recent years, research has indicated that approximately 60% of American adults have bought a gift card at least once. This statistic reveals just how embedded gift cards are in the shopping culture today. In fact, according to the National Retail Federation, gift card sales reached an astonishing $200 billion in recent years, making it a crucial element of the retail industry.

So, why do so many people choose to buy gift cards? There are several reasons that drive this purchasing behavior. Here are a few key motivations:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-many-people-buy-gift-cards  
  
- **Convenience:** Gift cards are incredibly convenient. They eliminate the hassle of finding the perfect gift. Whether it's for birthdays, holidays, or just because, they allow consumers to give the recipient the flexibility to choose what they truly want.
- **Variety:** With an endless range of options, from retail stores to restaurants and even online platforms, gift cards cater to diverse tastes and preferences. People can find the perfect card for anyone on their shopping list.
- **Budget-Friendly:** Many consumers appreciate the ability to set a clear budget when giving gifts. Gift cards come in various denominations, making it easy for buyers to stick to their financial plans.
- **Personalization:** While they can be seen as less personal than traditional gifts, gift cards can still be customized. Many retailers offer options to add personal messages or even select gift packaging, making them more thoughtful.

The demographics of gift card buyers also play a significant role in their proliferation. Studies indicate that younger consumers are more likely to purchase gift cards than older generations. Millennials and Gen Z account for a larger share of gift card sales, and they prefer digital gift cards, which can be sent via email or mobile apps. This shift to digital payment methods highlights the importance of keeping up with trends that attract younger shoppers.

Moreover, businesses also recognize the advantages of selling gift cards. They not only encourage new customers to enter their stores but often lead to additional spending. Research suggests that consumers using gift cards tend to spend about 20% more than the gift card's value, benefiting retailers significantly. This trend reveals how gift cards stimulate further consumer engagement and revenue generation.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-many-people-buy-gift-cards  
  
Given this background, it’s essential to recognize how prevalent gift cards have become in everyday transactions. The reality is that millions of individuals turn to gift cards when shopping for others, especially during peak seasons such as the holidays. According to industry statistics, around 66% of consumers plan to buy gift cards during major holidays, making it a staple in holiday gift-giving.

As we delve into the patterns of gift card purchases, consider also the impact of economic factors. In challenging economic times, consumers may be more inclined to buy gift cards as a safer option, particularly when shopping for friends and family. The predictability of these purchases provides peace of mind, knowing that recipients can choose what they need or want most.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-many-people-buy-gift-cards  
  
The question of how many people buy gift cards each year reflects not just numerical data but a deeper understanding of consumer behavior and preferences. With millions of transactions taking place annually, gift cards have cemented their place in retail and consumer culture. They serve as a versatile and convenient option for shoppers, resulting in significant increases in overall spending. The growth trajectory of gift card sales shows no signs of slowing down, suggesting that this gifting method will remain a popular choice for years to come.

Keep this data in mind when shopping for friends or planning your own budgets. Whether as gifts or personal treats, gift cards represent a win-win situation for both consumers and businesses alike.

Trends in Gift Card Usage: What Types of Gift Cards Are Most Popular Among Shoppers?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gift cards have become a beloved choice for many shoppers, offering convenience and flexibility as they allow the recipient to choose exactly what they want. In recent years, trends in gift card usage have revealed a fascinating shift in what types of gift cards are the most popular among consumers. Understanding these trends can help both shoppers and retailers tailor their strategies, ensuring a more satisfying experience for all involved.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-many-people-buy-gift-cards  
  
In 2023, it is estimated that billions of dollars are spent on gift cards each year. This number has demonstrated steady growth as more people embrace the culture of gift-giving through gift cards. The versatility they offer has led to an increase in purchases across various demographics, making them a staple in gift-giving celebrations like birthdays, holidays, and other special occasions.

So, what types of gift cards are currently trending among shoppers? Here’s a closer look at some of the most popular categories:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-many-people-buy-gift-cards  
  
- **Retail Gift Cards:** Retail gift cards remain at the forefront, with major brands like Amazon, Walmart, and Target topping the list. These cards are appealing because they grant shoppers the freedom to pick from a vast array of products.
- **Restaurant Gift Cards:** Dining out is a favorite pastime for many, making restaurant gift cards immensely popular. Chains such as Starbucks, Olive Garden, and Chipotle frequently rank high in consumer purchases. These offerings encourage dining experiences rather than just transactions.
- **Online Shopping Gift Cards:** As e-commerce grows, online shopping cards have seen a spike in demand. Gift cards for platforms like Etsy, eBay, and other online services enable recipients to explore unique products or experiences from the comfort of their homes.
- **Experience Gift Cards:** More shoppers are prioritizing experiences over physical gifts. This has led to a rise in interest in gift cards for activities such as spa treatments, amusement parks, or local experiences, like cooking classes or escape rooms.
- **Digital Content Gift Cards:** Individuals frequently enjoy streaming services, gaming, and apps. Cards for platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and the PlayStation Store are increasingly popular as they cater to entertainment and leisure.

The increasing individualization of gift-giving has fueled the popularity of specific types of gift cards. Many shoppers now seek to match their gift to the recipient's interests. For example, a gift card for a local coffee shop may appeal more to a friend who loves artisanal beverages, whereas a card for a high-end fashion retailer may resonate with a fashionista.

Another trend influencing gift card usage is the rise of digital and mobile gift cards. With technology making transactions quicker and more efficient, many consumers prefer the convenience of sending gift cards via email or through text messages. Mobile wallets also allow for easy storage and instant availability, which has contributed to a surge in their popularity.

An interesting aspect of trends in gift card usage can be seen in the demographics of buyers. Younger generations, especially Millennials and Gen Z, favor gift cards that align with their lifestyle and interests. They are more inclined to choose cards for experiences, online platforms, and brands with sustainable practices, as these values resonate with their beliefs and priorities.

Moreover, the gifting season has influenced the popularity of specific gift cards. During holiday seasons, shoppers gravitate towards cards that offer flexibility and wide-ranging options. In contrast, for occasions like graduations or weddings, experience-based gift cards tend to be favored, as they create memorable experiences for the recipients.

A key factor retailers should consider is the incorporation of personalization features into their gift card offerings. Popular gift card retailers now provide customizable options, allowing purchasers to add a personal touch with messages or designs. This tends to make the gift card feel more special and tailored, potentially increasing customer satisfaction.

The trends in gift card usage have evolved significantly, reflecting the diverse interests and purchasing habits of today’s consumers. As the market continues to grow, being aware of what types of gift cards are most loved can help both buyers and sellers make informed choices. Whether you opt for a retail gift card or an experience-based option, the goal is to share joy and create lasting memories with your gift card selection.

### Conclusion

As we explore the fascinating world of gift cards, it becomes clear that these convenient payment options are more than just pieces of plastic; they represent a significant component of consumer spending. Each year, millions of people purchase gift cards, reflecting their popularity as preferred gifts for various occasions. The sheer volume of transactions illustrates how gift cards have become a reliable choice for both givers and recipients.

Trends in gift card usage reveal that certain types are truly favored among shoppers. Retail gift cards from well-known brands consistently top the list, showcasing consumers' desire for flexibility and choice. Additionally, digital gift cards are gaining traction, aligning with the growing trend of online shopping. This demonstrates how technology is reshaping the way we give and receive gifts, providing added convenience for today's consumers.

The increase in gift card sales not only highlights their ongoing relevance but also showcases the impact they have on consumer spending habits. When a person receives a gift card, they often spend more than its face value, contributing to a boost in retail sales. This insight emphasizes the value that gift cards bring to both consumers and retailers alike.

It's important to **keep track of your spending**. Create a spreadsheet of your finances so you can see how much you have to spend each month.

Be sure to include your income from:

* student loans
* scholarships and bursaries
* any parental contributions
* a part-time job.

You'll also need to monitor regular outgoings such as your rent and mobile phone.

# Cook meals for your housemates

As a student with a strict budget, you'll need to **be smart with food shopping**. Do a cost-effective 'big shop' at the start of each week and minimise the number of takeaways you have. Buy supermarket value products rather than well-known brands, and shop at the end of the day when many items are discounted.

**Share the cooking** with those you're living with and plan your daily meals in advance. If you don't fancy yourself as a whizz in the kitchen, there are lots of helpful resources online, including simple-to-follow recipes.

You'll also save money by making packed lunches rather than buying a sandwich or going to a coffee shop.

# Reduce your travel costs

Most universities are either city-based with excellent public transport links, or campus-based with everything on your doorstep. You probably won't need a car while studying. Instead, **look for student discounts** on travel.

For instance, if you take the train regularly, a 16-25 railcard will pay for itself. Costing £30 for one year or £70 for three, it gives you a third off most rail fares across Great Britain and will save you around £192 per year.

Mature students can download the digital-only 26-30 railcard, costing £30 per year while also offering a third off fares, saving you around £258 a year.

Local buses remain one of the cheapest ways to get around. Check whether you're entitled to any student discounts or weekly/monthly passes on the services you use. For instance, Stagecoach offers a Unirider student bus card - you can also buy seven-day and 28-day passes.

# Don't pay full price for course books

Once you discover your reading list for the academic year, **buy your course books second-hand** wherever possible. You won't need to buy them all and can borrow set texts from the library.

You'll find cheap second-hand copies online through sites such as Amazon or Preloved, or through your university.

If you plan to buy any new books, make sure you get money off your purchases through a discount site such as StudentBeans. You can always sell the books when they're no longer required.

# Save money as a household

If you're sharing a student house, you'll be responsible for your gas, electricity, water and Wi-Fi costs. **Use comparison websites to get the best deals** and keep costs down by saving energy.

**Set up direct debits for regular bills**, so they're paid automatically each month. This will help you to avoid any late payment charges.

Sharing bills among housemates can be effective if this is managed carefully. Make sure people are paid back as quickly as possible. This will avoid any unnecessary tension should anybody consistently fail to pay their share.",1,1734079973.0,CollegeChatter,0,1.0,False

1hd845a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hd845a/my_18f_boyfriend_18m_of_25_years_feels_immature/,"My (18F) boyfriend (18M) of 2.5 years feels immature and irresponsible, and I’m thinking about ending things.","Hi everyone, I’m really struggling and could use some advice. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, and while things were great before, everything changed when we moved in together. Now, I’m starting to feel like I’m more of his mother than his girlfriend, and I don’t know if I can keep doing this.

For context, I’ve been living alone since I was 16. I’m pretty independent and responsible, and I have a strict routine that helps me manage my life (I’m autistic and have ADHD). My parents support me financially because they earn good money—not “rich rich,” but enough to help out. However, my boyfriend has always acted like they’re super rich, which has caused issues. At first, they even helped him out financially, but after a big fight where I felt like I was being treated unfairly, they refused to support him anymore.

Here’s what’s been going on:

* **He refuses to take responsibility for basic things.** For example, he insisted on handling “our finances” (even though we barely have any money) and asked me to open a shared account when I turned 18 so he could see our spending. The account has been open for over a month, but he still hasn’t verified his identity with the bank (which takes five minutes). He always talks about managing our money, but he won’t even take the first step.
* **I feel like he treats me like his mom.** He used to expect me to cook all his meals and didn’t do any chores before we had a major fight about it. Even now, I’m still the one doing most of the work around the house.
* **He doesn’t respect my routine or needs.** This morning was the perfect example. My routine is super important to me—it’s the only way I can stay productive and functional. I wake up at 6 a.m., have coffee, feed my dog, and take her on a 1.5-hour walk, so I’m back by 8 a.m. That’s when I set an alarm for him on Alexa to wake up.

Today, I got home around 8:05 a.m. and found him still asleep, with the alarm turned off. We had just discussed yesterday that he would try to establish a routine for himself, so I was irritated. I told him to get up and suggested that if he wanted to snooze, he should still be up by 8:20 a.m. at the latest. My desk is in the bedroom because we don’t have much space, and I need him up so I can start working.

Instead of appreciating the effort I’ve been putting into helping him, he got mad at me because I was waking him up “way too early” since he only has to leave for university an hour later—despite the fact that he’s always late to his lectures.

His “morning routine” consists of 30 minutes of trying to “turn his brain on,” 20 minutes of sitting on the toilet (it used to be 40 before I convinced him to eat vegetables), and 10 minutes to get dressed and eat. I thought I was helping him set a better routine so he wouldn’t fail university, but instead, he more or less called me weird and selfish.

When I pointed out that he struggles to plan his own life and gets mad at me for trying to help, he said, “Of course you’re saying that—it’s all from you watching too much TikTok and it brainwashing you.”

I’m exhausted. I care about him, but it feels like I’m carrying the entire relationship. Every time I try to bring up these issues, he either dismisses me, laughs it off, or gets defensive. I’ve even tried talking to his parents for help, but they acted like nothing was wrong and made me feel like I was the crazy one.

At this point, I don’t feel respected, and I’m starting to think we’re just too different to make this work. Am I being unreasonable for wanting him to take responsibility and respect my routine? Is there any way to fix this, or is it time to seriously consider ending things?

Thanks so much for reading. I’d appreciate any advice.

And also dear bf, if you see this, it might be a wake-up call for you—or maybe not…

**TL;DR:** My (18F) boyfriend (18M) of 2.5 years has become immature and irresponsible since we moved in together. I’ve been living independently since 16, and I rely on a strict routine (I’m autistic/ADHD). He doesn’t respect my routine, treats me like his mom, and doesn’t take responsibility for his life. This morning we fought because I woke him “too early” to stick to a routine we agreed on. He dismisses my concerns, and I’m exhausted from carrying all the responsibility in the relationship. Is there any way to fix this, or should I break up with him?",1,1734079656.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

Διάβασε παρακάτω για να μάθεις πώς μπορείς να συμμετέχεις κι εσύ.

Είμαι ο Παναγιώτης — ξεκίνησα ως Μαθηματικός, στην συνέχεια έγινα Data Scientist και τώρα προσπαθώ να μπω στον χώρο της Τεχνολογικής Επιχειρηματικότητας και αγαπώ τις κοινότητες.

Η γνωριμία με άτομα με κοινά ενδιαφέροντα, η παρακολούθηση παρουσιάσεων και οι συζητήσεις για τεχνολογία είναι πράγματα που απολαμβάνω. Άλλωστε, έτσι μπήκα στον χώρο της τεχνολογίας με πτυχίο Μαθηματικών το 2018, όταν παρακολούθησα το πρώτο μου meetup και βρήκα την πρώτη θέση εργασίας ως #DataScientist.

Δυστυχώς, κατά τη διάρκεια της πανδημίας COVID-19, όλες οι κοινότητες αναγκάστηκαν να σταματήσουν, και οι συναντήσεις έγιναν διαδικτυακά. Αλλά, ας είμαστε ειλικρινείς. Το να τρως εικονική πίτσα και να κάθεσαι μπροστά από τον υπολογιστή σου (ξανά!) δεν μπορεί να συγκριθεί με την ανθρώπινη επαφή που προσφέρει ένα δια ζώσης γεγονός.

Γι’ αυτό είμαι εξαιρετικά ενθουσιασμένος για τη σεζόν 2024-2025, η οποία φαίνεται να είναι η πιο δραστήρια που έχει δει ποτέ η τεχνολογική κοινότητα της Θεσσαλονίκης.

1hd7v5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyConsumerReviews/comments/1hd7v5e/avenlur_modern_outdoor_swing_set_finally_found/,Avenlur Modern Outdoor Swing Set - finally found the backyard setup that doesn't make me cringe,"[How it looks :\)](https://preview.redd.it/rr9hsacbtk6e1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0fd8b8a786ecbb2d6bff53c7ffc65640f69e1)

After trying what feels like every swing set under the sun (and spending way too much time reading reviews while drinking cold coffee), I think I've finally found the winner. We've had 5 different playsets over the years between our house and our previous place, and this Avenlur is hands down the most solid choice we've made.

Quick background: We needed something that could handle multiple kids (we host a lot of playdates), wouldn't be an eyesore in our backyard, and would actually last longer than a year or two. After testing this out for 6 months with my 4 and 7-year-olds (plus their friends), I can honestly say this thing delivers.

What's working great:

* The modern design actually looks decent in our backyard (my partner was skeptical at first but now admits it beats the bright primary color plastic monstrosities we had before)
* Fits up to 7 kids at once, which is clutch for playdates. The weight limit of 110 lbs per kid is generous
* The covered fort is a game-changer in summer - kids can play even during peak sun hours
* Rock wall is surprisingly sturdy and has been great for building their confidence (my formerly cautious 4-year-old now thinks she's Alex Honnold)

Some real talk about the build: The pine wood comes pre-cut and pre-drilled, which saved us major headaches during setup. We live in a pretty rainy area, and so far the wood has held up really well - no warping or splintering like our last set. The non-toxic finishes were a big selling point for me since my youngest still thinks everything needs to be taste-tested.

Minor gripes:

* Assembly took longer than advertised (what doesn't?)
* The sandpit area is nice but you'll need to buy the sand separately
* Shipping can be tricky depending on your location

Price-wise, it's in the middle range of wooden playsets, but considering we've burned through cheaper ones in the past, I'd say it's worth the investment. After trying various brands (won't name names but you know the usual suspects), this is the first one that feels like it'll actually last through both kids' childhood years.

Bottom line: If you're in the market for a playset that won't make your backyard look like a McDonald's playground and will actually survive more than one season, the **Avenlur Modern Outdoor Swing Set** is probably your best bet. My kids have used it daily for 6 months straight, and it's still as solid as day one.",4,1734078421.0,MyConsumerReviews,0,1.0,False

Διάβασε παρακάτω για να μάθεις πώς μπορείς να συμμετέχεις κι εσύ.

Είμαι ο Παναγιώτης — ξεκίνησα ως Μαθηματικός, στην συνέχεια έγινα Data Scientist και τώρα προσπαθώ να μπω στον χώρο της Τεχνολογικής Επιχειρηματικότητας και αγαπώ τις κοινότητες.

Η γνωριμία με άτομα με κοινά ενδιαφέροντα, η παρακολούθηση παρουσιάσεων και οι συζητήσεις για τεχνολογία είναι πράγματα που απολαμβάνω. Άλλωστε, έτσι μπήκα στον χώρο της τεχνολογίας με πτυχίο Μαθηματικών το 2018, όταν παρακολούθησα το πρώτο μου meetup και βρήκα την πρώτη θέση εργασίας ως #DataScientist.

Δυστυχώς, κατά τη διάρκεια της πανδημίας COVID-19, όλες οι κοινότητες αναγκάστηκαν να σταματήσουν, και οι συναντήσεις έγιναν διαδικτυακά. Αλλά, ας είμαστε ειλικρινείς. Το να τρως εικονική πίτσα και να κάθεσαι μπροστά από τον υπολογιστή σου (ξανά!) δεν μπορεί να συγκριθεί με την ανθρώπινη επαφή που προσφέρει ένα δια ζώσης γεγονός.

Γι’ αυτό είμαι εξαιρετικά ενθουσιασμένος για τη σεζόν 2024-2025, η οποία φαίνεται να είναι η πιο δραστήρια που έχει δει ποτέ η τεχνολογική κοινότητα της Θεσσαλονίκης.

I've been using portable power stations for about 5 years now, mainly for camping trips and as backup power during storm season. My partner and I have gone through 7 different models from various brands, but none quite hit the sweet spot until this one.

What really sets this generator apart:

* The 3600Wh capacity is no joke - During our last 3-day camping trip, it powered our electric cooler, charged everyone's devices, ran our portable fan at night, and still had juice to spare. My partner was impressed that it could handle his coffee maker without breaking a sweat (a first for our portable power stations).
* The LiFePO4 battery chemistry gives me peace of mind about longevity. After dealing with a previous unit that started losing capacity after just a year, the 3500 cycle rating and 10-year lifespan is a huge upgrade.
* Charging speed is incredible - Getting a full charge in 1.2 hours means I can top it up during lunch if needed. The solar charging capability works great too - I connected it to my existing panels and it charged notably faster than my previous unit.

Real-world performance has been solid. During a recent 6-hour power outage, it seamlessly kept our internet running and powered the fridge without missing a beat. The UPS feature with 5-8ms switchover time actually works as advertised - my partner's work laptop didn't even hiccup during the outage.

Minor drawbacks to consider:

* It's definitely on the heavier side compared to smaller units
* The app is functional but could be more intuitive
* The cooling fan can be noticeable when under heavy load

After extensive use both at home and outdoors, the **OSCAL PowerMax 3600** stands out as the most capable and reliable portable power station I've used. While it's not the cheapest option out there, the build quality, capacity, and versatility make it worth the investment if you're serious about portable power.

Happy to answer any specific questions about my experience with it. We use ours at least weekly between camping and backup power needs, so I've put it through its paces pretty thoroughly.

P.S. If anyone's curious about specific power draw scenarios or comparisons with other models, just ask. I've probably tested whatever situation you're wondering about",3,1734078179.0,MyConsumerReviews,0,1.0,False

1hd7t3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hd7t3q/aitah_for_praying_for_my_crush_to_leave_the_city/,AITAH for praying for my crush to leave the city,"I(23 F) had a HUGE probably the biggest crush of my lifetime on this one guy(23 M) from ig Delhi(not sure since most info about him i got from his socials iykyk). Long story short, i was coping with life in corporate, adulting and doing everything alone and was recovering from a fall out with one of my best friends, infact lost contact with all of my friends(the same work busy and no time for friends stuff). One day, while commuting to work, i see this dude, almost dreamy in jan this year, he looked like sunlight on the cold mornings(lol poetic). I kept staring until I realized he too was staring me, and crazy part he got into my same cab, and to the best of plots, he works in my company. I couldn't have asked for better, then I kept seeing him in the office, everywhere, during coffee, during lunch, during random walks. He is everywhere i go, which is strange and we have too many eye contacts that his eyes are etched on my brain cells. 
Never been soo happy for just seeing someone, slowly, i started my delulu dreams, the crossover went from stares from afar or across the room to bumping into each other, randomly getting seating almost beside each other. After 8 months of almost so many swoon worthy incidents, he spoke to me casual cab talk, all i could utter was ""yeah"", ""sure"", but i imagined our kids faces for the rest of the month, until...
One day, a text pops up in common chat, its from him, he is looking for relocation, I am from Hyderabad, and right now we are both on Hyderabad, he wants to relocate to Noida (ofc he is from delhi), then once all the dreams and kids popped off my brain. I was at once closer to earth core(pataal) dropped directly from cool clouds(jannat). All the eye contacts and bumping and delulus were confusing me and i still thought it'd take sometime for him to leave and I'd have a proper talk and make him my friend. 
So, i spoke, like the dumbest creature on earth i asked his name and asked how transfer works(lol, lol, lol, there's a huge freely available already well known document) he recovered from my dumbness and answered some stuff which i was clearly not listening and then told me he didn't get it yet. Thats all i needed to know, HE DIDN'T GET IT YET, SO HE IS NOT GETTING IT ANYTIME SOON. 
I went on with my delusions of how hes going to stay forever and we have kids later(because what else is his transfer getting delayed for right?)
But I was too shy to talk to him after the dumb question, because ik he might have thought or got the hint that i asked it just because i wanted to talk. No efforts from his end. But I saw him very sad, almost depressed, ofc the not getting the transfer effected him badly and I was happy in it. A month went by and I barely saw his smile. I was very guilty and thought maybe he's staying back because i am wishing for it, so i kept everything aside and prayed that he get the transfer he's soo sad about. I kept praying and avoided him because I was now guilty(because in my head he is sad because of me) and embarrassed(ofc of the silly move) 
Until one day in mid November when we had like two crossovers and i was rushing away from him, ofc i was still guilty and embarrassed and he looked confused, but didn't say a word. I saw him one last time at the exit of our company and thats it. Later I learned that he got the transfer. Prayers are indeed heard!

The book recommends to have on last shot of the poison. I don't really want to follow this advice. But I will give it a try. There is power in rituals after all.

I usually have coffee with milk. For the last one, I want the pure taste of coffee in a very mindful way. I go for one tiny half-caf espresso.

I feel terrible already because of a lack of sleep and a cold. Sitting in front of the cup my pulse is up in anticipation. My gut rumbles. For me there is a big psychological component to this.

The smell is not really there (cold and stale old coffee).

I taste the bitterness, I have come to like. But there is also something burned. 

cigarettes come to mind. When you try one after quitting. Anticipation mixed with dread. 

I don't enjoy it. I don't really want to finish it. It feels like as a child, when you were caught smoking and are force to smoke a whole pack. (Did not happen to me)

There is the effect: my brain fog lifts. I feel more alert. Heart rate is still high but not in the unpleasant range. I is a drug, it is potent. Remember, it has potent side effects.

Last sip: cold already, grounds suspended. Bah. I enjoy it much more when warm (and liquid)!

It is Friday, December 13th 2024 and now I am free.

P.S. The taste and the grounds still linger in my mouth. It feels both pleasant and unpleasant.

Normally by now I would have been distracted by work or something else. In fact I very rarely drink coffee mindfully. It is certainly an interesting experience. I will stay with it for a while.",3,1734078118.0,decaf,0,0.81,False

- Kagawa: 50 sqm 1LDK for 80k yen/month
- Zengyo: 42 sqm 1LDK for 80k yen/month

Both apartments are nice and meet my needs.

For commuting, I’m fine with a 1-hour train ride since I only need to go to the office once a week. I value a peaceful and convenient location, but I also appreciate good access to nearby amenities—like a nice coffee shop or workspace (e.g., Veloce or similar).

I know neither area is very close to the beach, but I enjoy biking and would love to occasionally bike to the coast.

Any local insights or experiences with these areas would be super helpful. Thanks.",1,1734077722.0,japanlife,14,0.6,False

Can anyone recommend any easy day trips for tomorrow? 

We aren’t looking to go far. Maybe maximum a 40 minute train, or taxi. 

We weren’t hoping for loads to do, or luxury. Maybe just a typical Latvian town/city to wonder for 3 hours, get a coffee, get lunch.
