1ii8or7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ii8or7/day_one_detox/,Day ONE detox,"Out of all the things I've quit or started THIS one scares me the most!

Today I begin a slow, deliberate detox from coffee

I normally drink 4 cups of Paul Newmans Own Organics every day. Once in a while I've had 5 cups. 

Today is 3 maximum.  

According to the nutritional information there is 150mg of caffeine per serving. (I drink a large from my Keurig machine each serving).

So I've been drinking 600mg a day!

I'm in year 3 of retirement (I'll be 61 in June)

I used to drink 6-8 cups a day. 

Then I would pound down a 6 pack of beer after work/at night!

Today is day 100 no alcohol. 

I also started hard-core keto diet on January 1st. 

IM GOING TO DO THIS

My first goal is to get to ONE small cup of coffee a day. 

After that I will re-evaluate and consider 100% caffeine free. 

(I probably should be 100% caffeine free because I have bipolar 2).

Hi folks,

I'm based in the North East of Scotland and I recently got my hands on the Lelit Anna 2 and the Fellow Opus grinder.

When I first got it the grinder I cranked it down to 1, and gave it a spin.

The pressure just jumped through the roof and the shot came out slower than a week in the jail. I mean,¬†*dribbled*. It would have taken 2 minutes + to get anything like 36g from an 18g dose.

I've since played around with grinds, settled at 3.5 and get a beautiful coffee, so, I'm content. Well, ish.

The idea that I might be able to make an even¬†***better***¬†coffee, if I grind finer, is plaguing me üòÇ

Just to show everyone, this was ground at the '2' setting,¬†**18g**¬†of medium/light roast beans (for anyone wondering, it's¬†**Scenery Coffee - El Jaragual Espresso, Tropic, Melon, Vanilla**, and it's absolutely sensational)

You can see for yourself, any slower and it'll be too late in the day for a coffee...

The pressure is also way too high.

The reason I tamped it like I was afraid of it was because I knew how this would play out, so, wanted tamp it minimally whilst still actually tamping... if that makes sense. Just to avoid the inevitable 'you're tamping too hard' comments, which I realise is impossible. They'll come.

Also, excuse the Lelit supplied tamper, I have a 3 week old newborn and have been a bit too busy to sort out my next upgrades (tamper, leveller, new basket).

Lastly, excuse my partner speaking Macedonian in the background. I don't speak it, so don't have a scooby what she's saying. Hopefully nothing too personal

The clock in the corner of the dusty room had stopped ticking long ago, its hands frozen at 3:17, a forgotten relic of a moment no one remembered. Dust motes danced lazily in the narrow beams of morning light that seeped through the cracked blinds, casting fragile patterns on the faded rug below. The room held whispers of conversations past, laughter now distant echoes, and the invisible fingerprints of lives once vivid but now blurred by time.

Elias sat in the old leather chair, its seams frayed and tired, much like the man himself. His fingers traced the faint grooves carved into the wooden armrest‚Äîtiny notches marking years or perhaps days, no one knew for certain. The leather smelled faintly of old tobacco and forgotten winters, carrying a hint of something metallic, like the taste of unspoken words. His gaze drifted, not to the present, but to fragments stitched unevenly across his mind‚Äîfaces half-remembered, voices that slipped through the cracks of memory like water through cupped hands. He remembered a Tuesday afternoon, sharp and clear against the haze, when he chose silence over truth, and how that single decision became the fragile thread unraveling the fabric of something he once called home.

Across town, in an apartment that smelled faintly of rain-soaked concrete and stale coffee, Mara stared at the ceiling, counting the silent beats between her heart's reluctant thuds. She wondered how a single decision, made hastily on a Tuesday afternoon, could ripple outward, tugging at the threads of a life she barely recognized anymore. Her regrets were etched into the spaces she never filled‚Äîa call she never made, a door she never knocked on, a photograph she never looked at twice until it was too late. Forgotten birthdays, unspoken apologies, fleeting moments that felt insignificant then but now loomed like towering monuments in the landscape of her regrets.

Their stories were threads in the same tapestry, though neither knew of the other‚Äôs existence. Yet, their lives intersected in invisible ways‚Äîa glance exchanged in a crowded street, brief yet magnetic, lingering longer than it should have in the mind of a stranger. Was it recognition? A flicker of familiarity in unfamiliar eyes? Or perhaps the echo of a life unlived, a parallel path glimpsed only for a heartbeat. That stranger carried more than just anonymity; woven into their presence was the quiet hum of danger, not in the obvious sense, but the kind that shifts the trajectory of lives without notice‚Äîthe danger of what might have been or what could still be.

As the days unfolded, the forgotten details of their pasts would surface, stitched together through the perspectives of those they'd touched, knowingly or not. Each chapter, a window into a moment that seemed small until the weight of memory gave it shape and meaning.

This is where it begins‚Äînot with a grand event or a heroic act, but with the quiet spaces in between, the forgotten minutes that make up a life.

# Principali mercati e offerte

**Armi elettriche non letali (dispositivi TASER):**

* **Storia e utilizzo:** Il dispositivo TASER √® cos√¨ conosciuto che molti lo usano come termine generico per indicare i comuni storditori elettrici. In realt√†, Axon ha aperto la strada alle moderne ‚Äúarmi a conduzione elettrica,‚Äù offrendo alle forze dell‚Äôordine un‚Äôopzione meno letale rispetto alle armi da fuoco.
* **Principali destinatari:** Forze di polizia, aziende di sicurezza e, a seconda delle normative locali, anche privati o istituzioni.

**Body cam e videocamere da auto:**

* **Obiettivo:** Fornire prove video delle attivit√† di polizia, migliorando la trasparenza e la fiducia da parte della comunit√†.
* **Modalit√† di funzionamento:** Le videocamere registrano filmati in alta definizione, caricandoli automaticamente nel cloud di Axon per la gestione sicura delle prove.
* **Clienti:** Per lo pi√π dipartimenti di polizia locale, grandi corpi di polizia metropolitana e agenzie federali.

**Gestione delle prove nel cloud e servizi software (Axon Evidence):**

* **Scopo:** Archiviare, gestire, analizzare e condividere prove digitali (video, foto, documenti) in un ambiente cloud sicuro.
* **Integrazione:** Il materiale registrato dalle body cam, i dati di utilizzo dei TASER e altri file digitali vengono centralizzati, riducendo il carico amministrativo per gli agenti e supportando i processi legali.
* **Strumenti di IA:** Draft One, l‚Äôassistente AI di Axon per la stesura dei rapporti, mira ad automatizzare le attivit√† di routine, liberando il personale da compiti ripetitivi.

**Soluzioni per droni e robotica (Axon Air, Dedrone, Sky-Hero):**

* **Portata:** Axon Air fornisce droni per le forze dell‚Äôordine, utili a raccogliere riprese aeree e offrire una consapevolezza situazionale in tempo reale.
* **Acquisizioni:** Dedrone si occupa di rilevare e neutralizzare droni non autorizzati, mentre Sky-Hero copre la robotica tattica indoor per squadre SWAT o reparti specializzati.
* **Obiettivo:** Andare oltre le soluzioni ‚Äúa terra‚Äù per includere la sicurezza dello spazio aereo, ampliando la mission di Axon in ambito di pubblica sicurezza.

**Software di gestione di documenti ufficiali e di dispaccio (Axon Records, Computer-Aided Dispatch):**

* **Prodotti in fase iniziale:** Axon sta introducendo gradualmente soluzioni integrate che permettono alle agenzie di gestire chiamate, assegnare risorse e redigere rapporti in un‚Äôunica piattaforma.
* **Potenziale futuro:** L‚Äôazienda vede in questo settore un mercato da diversi miliardi di dollari, che amplia i ricavi da abbonamenti e rafforza le sue capacit√† di gestione dei dati.

Attraverso queste proposte, Axon si configura come una piattaforma completa per la pubblica sicurezza, offrendo dispositivi (TASER, telecamere, droni) e software fortemente integrati (gestione delle prove, strumenti di intelligenza artificiale, gestione dei documenti). Questa combinazione accresce la fidelizzazione dei clienti e alimenta le entrate ricorrenti di Axon.",1,1738756846.0,scimmieinborsa,0,1.0,False

I cum inside, face, mouth then swallowed, and we did anal too.

What amazes me is, it's like he and I know how to please each other. It's like we both never forget what makes our partner happy. Honestly, yesterday's experience was really good for me personally.

On the last day when checking out, he told me 'don't contact me unless you're in Bali'. So yeah after I went back to Java, I didn't contact him again.

I saw my GP today after reaching out about how limited my diet has become. I‚Äôve developed an extreme phobia of anaphylaxis (not an unheard of reason for ARFID) - my diet is basically chicken, rice, coffee, potato and vanilla ice cream. I have a history of health anxiety and OCD that my GP knows about.

My GP was very understanding and she mentioned ARFID was her first thought, but then said she felt it was deeper than just ‚Äúavoiding certain foods.‚Äù I think her understanding of ARFID is that it‚Äôs mainly avoiding textures or just not being interested in eating. She said I need mental health help as opposed to an eating disorder specialist.

I agree with the part about mental health, and she is referring me to some people who will help me deal with anxiety in general, but she said she wants to keep a CBT referral on the back burner for right now ‚òπÔ∏è She gave me a link to a mindfulness app, I can‚Äôt help but feel this is useless. I know my behaviour is stupid. I just can‚Äôt stop the compulsive thoughts of having an allergic reaction.

I have recently had a kidney transplant in the month of December and I‚Äôm dealing with a tough situation at home after the transplant. I‚Äôve been back home for a little over a month now, and my parents have been incredibly protective, which I understand to a point. They‚Äôve set up certain rules, like making sure I take my medicines on time, but things are starting to get out of hand.

Here‚Äôs the issue:  
I‚Äôve recently moved back into my room, which I had to¬†incessantly¬†**fight for**, for days after being forced to sleep in my parents‚Äô room for a month because my parents wanted to keep an eye on me for my health and my medications. I get it, I do, but I needed my own space to study for exams and just to feel like myself again.

Now that I‚Äôm back in my room, things are still not great. The maid we hired to help around the house uses my¬†**bathroom**¬†and keeps¬†**her stuff in my room**, which just feels like I‚Äôm borrowing my own space. I have health concerns because of my kidney transplant (immunosuppression), so sharing a bathroom with the maid is a major worry for me, and it‚Äôs not a risk I‚Äôm willing to take.

I‚Äôve tried explaining this to my parents, but they don‚Äôt seem to care much about my comfort. They think I should use their bathroom to avoid any risk of infection. But¬†**my bathroom**¬†has everything set up the way I need it for my personal hygiene. It's frustrating because it feels like they care more about convenience than my health or personal space. Mind you I have indian parents so they probably do not give a shit about my comfort and ‚Äúpersonal space‚Äù

Also, the maid is¬†**constantly overstepping her boundaries**. she keeps dickriding my mother and she won‚Äôt do anything without asking my mom first‚Äîshe won‚Äôt even give me a spoon of sugar for my coffee without her permission! It‚Äôs also gotten to the point where she tries to intervene in arguments between me and my mom,¬†**shouting at me**¬†when it‚Äôs really none of her business. My dad agrees that she‚Äôs annoying and fucking dumb, but they still want to keep her around for convenience.

I‚Äôve tried to ask my parents to set boundaries with the maid, but every time I speak up, it just ends up making things worse. I‚Äôm honestly at my wits' end.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation? How do I make them understand that I need my space back and to stop letting the maid get away with all this?",1,1738755531.0,kidneytransplant,2,1.0,False

The thing is, the guy isn't just some weirdo, he is actually an established and respected member of the community around this hobby. He organises well-attended events centered around it. My friends like him. I talked about the situation with one of my friends who doesn't know him very closely, but they're acquainted and she was as weirded out as me, but didn't comment on it further. Just that in her presence he never behaved in ways like that. 

I am still confused about the situation. Was this a weird attempt at flirting? He obv wasn't interested for real because he didn't show any sign of wanting to extend our ""acquaintance"" further. Did he catch onto my shyness and found in me an easy target to humiliate? 
I will definitely see him again because this hobby has a fairly tight knit community and its impossible to not run into each other at events. I just wonder is he a creep? Should I be careful around him or possibly try to avoid him? I don't feel like I have to, I didn't feel threatened by him, just weirded out.

98kg - 89.5kg (216 lbs - 197 lbs) 

Mostly did 16:8 with occasional 23:1. 

I tracked calories practically everyday - I would estimate around 97% of days were tracked. 

Worked out 5 times per week, using progressive overload and aiming for near-to-failure reps on every working set of each exercise. Mostly 2-3 sets per muscle group, with occasional ones like shoulder and biceps getting hit with up to 5 sets as they would heal well between days. 

Biggest ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô things for me to maintain consistency were: 

1. Black coffee (gave me an additional 120-360 calories each day, depending on how many I‚Äôd have) 
2. Sugar free fizzies (this especially helped with sweet cravings - just have a coke no sugar)
3. Weighing out portion sizes (I found to it interesting to compare what I‚Äôd previously consider a healthy portion, to what would fit my macros). 

Still got a way to go for my goal weight of 83 - currently maintaining this new weight for approx 6 weeks then will begin another 3 months of calorie deficit.

1ii80hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1ii80hj/lost_in_the_souk_my_unexpected_journey_through/,Lost in the Souk: My Unexpected Journey Through Old Dubai,"Hey, everyone!

I had one of those days in Dubai that was full of surprises, and I had to share it with you all. So, I‚Äôm relatively new to the UAE, and I decided to explore the old side of Dubai this past weekend. I‚Äôd been hearing about the historical Al Fahidi district and the famous textile souk, so I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not spend a few hours getting lost in history?‚Äù

I wandered around the souk, admiring the colorful fabrics, handmade jewelry, and all the little shops that seemed to have endless hidden gems. Everything was going smoothly until, of course, I took a wrong turn. I ended up getting a bit lost and found myself in a completely different part of Old Dubai that I had never seen before. At first, I wasn‚Äôt worried, because, well, it‚Äôs Dubai, right? How hard can it be to get back to the main road?

Turns out, I stumbled into a small alleyway where I found a tiny, family-run caf√© that I‚Äôd never have found if I hadn‚Äôt gotten lost. The owner, an elderly man named Ahmed, invited me in for a coffee . We started talking, and he shared stories of the city‚Äôs history, his family‚Äôs business, and how he had seen Dubai change over the years. It was so cool to hear firsthand about the old Dubai that no one talks about in the tourist guides.

After a nice conversation and a cup of coffee, Ahmed kindly walked me back to the main street and gave me directions to all the best hidden spots around Al Fahidi. It turned out to be the best detour I could‚Äôve taken that day.

Moral of the story: sometimes getting lost leads to the best discoveries, and in a city as modern as Dubai, there‚Äôs still so much history hidden around every corner. If you ever find yourself in Old Dubai, take a wrong turn, and you might just find a hidden gem!

I am so stressed out because I work with people who just don‚Äôt care about anything. If i don‚Äôt come in early (off the clock) and open all the rooms and get everything ready for the providers for the day, it doesn‚Äôt get done. 

I have only been at this job for a little over 8 months. I received zero training (Due to the laziness of my coworkers). I had to teach myself everything or go against the unspoken rule of asking the provider how they prefer things to be done. 

I only get 4 hours a month of PTO and if we need time off to go to a doctors appointment we either take the whole morning off (4 hrs) or the whole afternoon off. Theres no ‚ÄúI need to leave an hour or so early for an appointment.‚Äù We don‚Äôt get sick  days and unpaid days off are not allowed. So i have no time to go see a doctor. I have not been able to see my psychiatrist in months and unable to get my medication. 
I have a stomach ulcer and was told when I went to the ER I need to follow up with a GI. I dont have time. 
Yesterday I was having heart palpitations and my Apple Watch alerted that my BPM was over 145 out of nowhere. I told the PA and he said go take your blood pressure. 
My BP was 150/101‚Ä¶. I told the doctor i felt light headed/dizzy and asked if I could take a few minutes to sit down and drink some water‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Her response was ‚ÄúLay off the coffee‚Äù.

Then I was forced to go assist in a surgery because no one else would do it. 

This job is killing me mentally and physically. 

I have applied at several other places, but they all want me to come in person for an interview. There is no possible way.

1ii7yri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ii7yri/chronic_gastritis/,Chronic gastritis,"So I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis for unknown reasons, the doctor said it might be because of stress (which is most properly) and bad diet.

I've been suffering for the past few months but I'm getting better now.

I wanted to write this as this subreddit helped me a lot and I wanted to share my experience, so even if one thing was beneficial for someone I will be glad.

Please note this is not medical advice, this is just what I've learned during this process, talk to your doctor before doing anything as every case is different.

Here's what I've discovered:

1) food wise, everyone is different and you need to do experiments with ingredients, try something and wait for a couple of hours to see how it reacts with your stomach.

2) walk slowly when ever you can, that helped me a lot, I've been walking around 2 hours everyday (I'm lucky that currently I have the time to do so, if you have, tou should've give it a try) and that helped my bowl movement a lot.

3) seasing wise, currently I only consume salt or soy sauce with food, so I'm living somewhat tastless diet, but what I discovered is that now I can taste and enjoy ingredients taste more and enjoy it. So it was hard for a couple of weeks then it was ok, but I still miss spices. I'm trying to not eat any spice for 3 months even if I was fully healed.

4) when I started, I wanted to take it as a chance to loss weight, so I cut off carbs (either way I wasn't eating much and I didn't have any appetite). But after 2 weeks of doing so every internal organ started to hurt, my kidney, my stomach, my colon, eveything, I felt pain everywhere in my abdomen. I thought my kidneys were failng until one day it was recommended to me to eat boiled potatoes, I did so and everything within a couple of hours calmed down and felt much much better. Even my flare ups were much less, I checked with my doctor he did some tests and everything was fine. 


5) try not to eat anything after 6 pm, and especially before 3 to 4 hours of sleeping, this helped my morning discomfort, I am currently waking up as I have no gastritis. Speaking of sleeping, I stopped sleeping on my stomach (which was my default) also if I feel that my stomach is going to flare up I sleep with 2 billows holding me elevated at least for the first couple of hours of my sleeping.

Also setting for long periods cause my stomach to flare up, so I try not to sit longer than 1 hour, I walk for a bit, especially after a meal.

6) I stopped dairy products, even yogurt, as I think I developed lactose intolerance during my sickness, every time I eat dairy products I feel bloated and my gas factory start its operation.

7) currently the ingredients that I can eat are: freah carrots, fresh sweet corn, boild potato, boild eggs, lettuce, cucumber, chicken breast or thigh, chicken liver, dried figs, dates, fresh mushroom, tinnnyy amount of yogurt (for it's health benefits for stomach), walnut, banana, warm water with honey, sourdough bread, a tiinny amount of fresh ginger.

All of my meals are of small quantity, for example: for lunch, I will cook medium size carrot, 200 to 250g of chicken breast or thigh, 2 or 3 mushrooms, small cup of corns. For breakfast usually, 1 banana, 1 piece of date and 1 slice of sourdough bread. For dinner I make egg salad, 1 cucumber, 2 or 3 leaf of lettuce and 2 boild egg with some yogurt and salt with 1 slice of toasted bread cutted to cubes. Or I will not have dinner at all based my my stomach after lunch

while eating, if I feel even a tiny bit of discomfort I stop, as it always, if ignored, leads to flare up.

8) finally, I decided to avoid soft drinks, even if it's only carbonated water. Also to cut off any source of caffeine, I had two visits to the hospital thinking I'm having a heart attack, an in both times I consumed a lot of soft drinks and coffee the few days before.

Tomatoes, spices, fish, sweet pepper, any acidy food, red meat, any kind of oil cause flare up. Drinking any thing too warm or too cold, eating any kind of cheese, not eating for long time all causes flare ups. 

I've stopped eating outside, I cook all my meals.

Also, I've drank water whenever i could, but not while eating, i always wait an hour after eating before drinking any water unless I need to.

It's been 40 days since my last visit to the doctor, i feel healthier, when I started I barely ate anything (first few days even water causes me to flare up even with medication)


Medication wise, I'm taking pantoprazole 40, one capsule in the morning and 1 hour before food, and occasionally after food when I have strong flare up I take reflux suppressant.

I hope you all get better soon, this experience taught me to appreciate food more and be mindful of my eating habbits.

Ps, sorry for grammar errors and mispells, it's not my first language.

Each enclosure would have a dinosaur for you to control but you have to complete tasks and those can be given by park dino handlers. Kinda like when in JW we get a glimpse of Rexy's enclosure and the handlers now use the flairs all the time to get her attention and for her to be on display for the public. But you'd also have an instinct meter that would go up if dino handlers repeated a task too many times like in a circus and that meter would give you tasks that are against park security but will satisfy your instinct meter and make it go down. This way we could get moments of awe and terror. I'm split between this being set in a 24 hour cycle with weather changes (storms would agitate dinos and make their instinct meter go up) or it jumping to specific moments of the day when stuff happens to avoid too much boring downtime (but that would remove a lot of the chill cute moments). I sway more to the 24h cycle which would make it endless however if the player purposefully played in a way to go against dino handlers too much and make their instinct bars get high, then it would trigger the park's downfall and we would get a major power outage or a storm that makes some fences go down and then it's manhunting time, baby!

over the course of the next few days, betty starts coming up to me randomly and runs from other. eventually she let me pet her and hold her. then my parents start feeding betty and the same thing happens, she starts to trust them. it was so cool to see this animal slowly learn trust.

I love him with all my heart, I just feel like I‚Äôm torturing him emotionally - I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. I moved from the US to London a year and a half ago to do my Masters and moved in with him (he asked me to move in with him & we‚Äôd been dating for a year at that point & did long distance) and our life has been incredible honestly. I‚Äôve grown, he‚Äôs grown - we‚Äôve both said plenty of times that this past year has been the best in our lives. We travel together, dance together, he cooks for me all the time, buys gifts for me & we are always doing cool things together - it‚Äôs wonderful actually. 

Our life should feel perfect‚Ä¶ but why do I feel so emotionally conflicted? 

He does so much for me. He‚Äôs always there for me. When I‚Äôm emotional (which is often), he‚Äôs always the one to make me smile. I just can‚Äôt help but feel like somethings wrong or missing? There have been moments when I‚Äôve felt like we‚Äôre not on the same page about things - he‚Äôs always talking about our flat being a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and the fact that his dad has him at his age ‚Ä¶ talks about children and building a future together and yes I want that at some point but im 23! He‚Äôs made jokes about kids too many times for comfort to the point where at some point I thought he was touching my stomach in a weird way because I was literally paranoid.

Anyways - aside from that I can‚Äôt help but notice signs with friends, strangers, etc - nobody seems to remember his name ever??? Like my friends are always like ‚ÄúI forget your boyfriend‚Äôs name etc‚Äù or it seems like whenever we‚Äôre in the club nobody seems to be interested in speaking to him or getting to know him‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs a bit upsetting?? I‚Äôve also had people say to us that they didn‚Äôt think we were together- just best friends‚Ä¶. And I feel like maybe I‚Äôm the one to blame but I don‚Äôt understand why. When we‚Äôre out we dance together - not always in a sexual way - but the best friend comments (yes, plural) are starting to get to me because what the hell. 

There have also been moments when I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm not doing enough for him & he‚Äôs always doing such incredible things for me - for context I just finished my MA and am working part time, he‚Äôs working full time & making quite a bit for London - and I‚Äôm not always in the best financial position to provide like him and it makes me feel inadequate (even though he said that‚Äôs silly)‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just one of those situations where I moved to London, moved in with him, and sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm not really able to have my own things. He buys me everything I need - we even started DJing together and he bought me two turntables to get started!!! He even makes me coffee every single morning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Why do I feel this way?!

Aside from that, recently we‚Äôve both felt like our sex lives have been disrupted. Honestly we‚Äôre both very sexual people, but we haven‚Äôt had sex since beginning of December and I know it‚Äôs winter, but I think some of my emotional turmoil is getting in the way of my attraction to him. Everytime I try to initiate it doesn‚Äôt go anywhere, but he‚Äôs always telling me how beautiful I am and sexy & gorgeous all hours of the day & says he loves me at least a few times a day!! I am so loving to him as well and tell him how much I love him all the time too and it‚Äôs cute‚Ä¶. But I can‚Äôt help but feel attracted to other people as well ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs such a weird feeling because I don‚Äôt want to give up this beautiful life we‚Äôre living to sexually explore someone else, so I‚Äôm ending up sexually frustrated and don‚Äôt know how to express myself to him about this. We talked about it last night and he said that he‚Äôs been feeling really down on himself and not sexy etc because of Christmas & that he doesn‚Äôt feel adequate next to me (like as my boyfriend) he explained that in the club or when we‚Äôre out people always compliment my outfits / appearance, but never his etc - similar to what I explained above, and that he feels like im not as proud as him to call him my partner! He said that I don‚Äôt always introduce him to people like he introduces me to others‚Ä¶. 

I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôve been extremely selfish about all this and it‚Äôs caused even more damage and the absolute last thing I want to do is hurt him! 

Additional context: 
This past Christmas was shambolic‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt go into the details because that‚Äôs an entirely new post, but basically we visited my family in the US and they treated him like actual shit & we ended up flying back to London early - I haven‚Äôt really spoken to that side of my family since ‚Ä¶ 

So that experience also put a huge wrecking ball into everything. I feel like I‚Äôm rambling and not even sure where to go from this point - kind of feeling like an unintentional terrible person which somehow makes it worse? Even last night he told me that he feels like he needs to do more for himself and I agreed and told him I felt like I‚Äôm always taking so much from him and it‚Äôs not fair ‚Ä¶. And even though it‚Äôs not my intention it‚Äôs clearly hurting him. 

Another example thats on my mind is that he is obsessed with Berlin. He loves it. We went last year at least 10 times which is insane. I love Berlin too! But he loves it in a way that he wants to move there and I told him go for it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to be in his way at all because I know how much it means to him. We‚Äôve done long distance and we can figure it out‚Ä¶ I just got a visa to stay in the UK so it‚Äôs not really aligned with what I want to do at this exact moment & he is basically putting his dreams on hold to stay here with me!!! It makes me so sad because I feel like I‚Äôm making him stay but he‚Äôs reassured me that he‚Äôs choosing to stay and he wants to stay with me and that‚Äôs more important than Berlin! But he talks about moving there everyday! And how it‚Äôs a better city than London & how much he hates London! Like everyday it‚Äôs something different‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthe lighting in Berlin is so much better‚Äù or ‚Äúthere‚Äôs so much more culture there etc etc‚Äù. It‚Äôs actual torture because I‚Äôm constantly feeling like I‚Äôm getting in the way of his dreams!! He‚Äôs lived here for 8 years and I‚Äôve only been here for just under 2, so I get it. But again I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôve also learned to take advice with a grain of salt from strangers & friends - but people I work with and friends have made comments about them not liking the way he speaks to me (as if I‚Äôm a child) and that I need to stand up for myself and set better boundaries. And also do more things for myself! Which I‚Äôve been getting better at - like the whole Berlin thing came to a head when he started telling people that ‚Äúwe‚Äù would be moving there ‚Äúsoon‚Äù ??? And I was like why are you telling people ‚Äúour‚Äù plans when we haven‚Äôt discussed them in the first place - also that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm looking to do because I literally just moved to London‚Ä¶ it just felt like he‚Äôs been taking control of my life in different ways & because I‚Äôm just starting out, I don‚Äôt have the financial agency to do things for myself / on my own, so I‚Äôm just letting him lead the way‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôm a very individualistic person to begin with so I don‚Äôt know how to balance all this.. ugh! 

Aside from this we have such a beautiful relationship - I mean honestly, this man has showed me what it means to be in love & have romance in my life. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking for by writing all this, just maybe some light on the situation. Honestly everything feels like it‚Äôs coming to an end sometime soon‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt want our relationship to end but again I feel like I‚Äôm torturing him ‚Ä¶.. i just want whats best for him & have never had to work through issues like this as this is my first relationship ever, and it‚Äôs been absolutely epic. I see him as my life partner. But do I need to let him go to see him flourish, and see myself flourish too?! Or just understand my internal conflict and communicate better to him to be a better partner.

1ii7rkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ii7rkc/melitta_reliability_is_shocking_1000_machine/,Melitta reliability is shocking - ¬£1000 machine totally defunct after just 3 years!,"I liked my Melitta machine - although the quality of the coffee was not quite on par with basic manual espresso machines, the convenience of having a cappuccino at the touch of a button was the key selling point.

However it is a bit of a leap to call it ""smart"" - the app is terribly limited and flaky, and it does not work over the internet or link to any smart home systems. There's no real advantage to having it at all.

After purchasing my new machine I emailed Melitta customer service for some questions about the machine and the app, it took weeks to get a boilerplate response that was entirely unrelated to the questions I asked. After a second polite email for clarification, I just got a rude ""no"" as an answer. They have made zero effort to improve the app or fix the bugs and limitations. This experience set the scene really for what was to come in future.

The first major problem was when the machine broke down after about a year. My usage is typically 1-2 drinks a day, not heavy at all. It is quite demanding on all the cleaning processes that need doing, even so I used the correct products and followed the maintenance procedures as recommended by the manufacturer. Under the warranty, I was instructed to send the machine away to be repaired. Although I returned it in its original box, when it came back it was packaged badly in a box that was too large, this had resulted in considerable cosmetic damage to the machine which I was quite upset about. It's worth a note that I posted a review on Trustpilot at that time - instead of contacting me to see if they could help to resolve their customer's dissatisfaction, Melitta simply had the review removed!

Anyway I had 2 more years of light use out of it before it broke down again. I followed advice online about cleaning it and resetting it, but to no avail. No one would touch the machine other than the one repair company endorsed by Melitta in the UK, ""Coffee Classics"". Now it's no longer under warranty, you have to pay ¬£30 to send it to them. It took 3 weeks for them to look at the machine - now I have a quote they are saying basically every main component is broken and needs to be replaced. The total bill will be over ¬£600. If I don't go ahead with the repair, I will still have to pay again to get the broken machine back (I guess they hope I won't, I only have their word for it that 4 different components all mysteriously failed at the same time... Draw your own conclusions on this.)

I am absolutely livid that such an expensive machine is so unreliable. You would expect for the price and from a ""reputable"" brand that it would last more than 3 years. I have experience with much cheaper machines that last decades without complaint. I certainly will not be parting with money for a Melitta machine again.",0,1738754292.0,superautomatic,0,0.5,False
1ii7rei,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1ii7rei/shortterm_review_of_the_ltt_commuter_backpack/,Short-Term Review of the LTT Commuter Backpack,"I've used the original LTT backpack for over a year and recently switched to the commuter version. Compared to the OG backpack, this one is noticeably slimmer, especially in depth. Right from the first use, I noticed that it puts significantly less pressure on my back. I assume this is because it's not as bulky, and items are positioned closer to my back, unlike the OG backpack.

One of the first improvements I appreciated was the new strap design. The straps are now secured with a clip, preventing them from dangling around‚Äîsomething I definitely prefer. The chest strap adjustment is also much better; it now stays in place without sliding to the top or bottom. However, detaching and reattaching it is a bit of a hassle, though it's not something you'd do often. The best part? The magnetic strip system from the OG backpack still works seamlessly with the new one.

# Compartments & Organization

My 14-inch MacBook Pro fits perfectly, as expected. While the commuter backpack lacks a dedicated power bank pocket on the side, I actually prefer the new water bottle pouch placement. Having two bottle holders‚Äîone for water and one for coffee‚Äîis a great addition, improving weight distribution. On the OG backpack, the side with the water bottle always felt heavier.

The small pockets in the laptop compartment are perfect for storing a power bank instead, and the main compartment offers enough space for essentials like medication, a screwdriver, or a pen. Naturally, the item compartment is smaller than in the OG backpack, but that‚Äôs expected. Even so, there's still enough room for a small grocery purchase or other daily-use items.

The build quality feels just as solid as the OG backpack, and I love the overall design.

# Comfort & Fit

One thing I noticed immediately‚Äîas a tall person with broad shoulders‚Äîis that the chest straps are a bit narrow or have a different curvature. It takes some getting used to, but it's still comfortable. I assume this change makes the backpack even more comfortable for smaller users as well.

The back padding feels softer and more breathable, which should help reduce sweat absorption and odor buildup over time.

# Additional Features & Concerns

* **Luggage Strap** ‚Äì Now permanently attached, making it more practical. On the OG backpack, detaching and reattaching it was cumbersome.
* **AirTag Pocket** ‚Äì Though the opening is small, the pocket itself is quite spacious, and it fits a Galaxy SmartTag easily.
* **Hidden Pockets in Water Bottle Holders** ‚Äì A neat addition and available on both sides.

That said, I do have some long-term concerns:

* The elasticity of the water bottle pockets and luggage strap‚ÄîI wonder how well they'll hold up after months or years of use.
* The MOLLE attachment from the OG backpack is gone, but in exchange, we get the second water bottle pocket, which is useful (especially for carrying an umbrella).

One other change:

* The carabiner zipper pulls are missing. I didn‚Äôt use them much on the OG backpack, but I liked their grip.

# Travel Considerations

One of the most interesting aspects of the commuter backpack is its potential as a personal item on flights. For example, Ryanair's luggage sizer is slightly larger than their stated max size, and the backpack itself is only 2 cm too tall, meaning it should be easy to squeeze in thanks to its flexible design. While the OG backpack fits as a carry-on, the commuter backpack could be a perfect personal item, allowing you to pair it with a hard-shell carry-on suitcase.

# Final Verdict

At $150, the LTT Commuter Backpack is well worth the price. If you were lucky enough to grab it during the YouTube shopping promo for $120, you got an even better deal. Ordering from Europe (Austria, in my case) was no issue, though I assume I got lucky with shipping out of Vancouver.

Overall, the commuter backpack differentiates itself clearly from the OG backpack and complements it rather than replacing it. If you're traveling light or need something more compact, the commuter backpack is an excellent addition alongside a carry-on suitcase. But if you need more space, the OG backpack still has you covered.

She stared at the unassuming man sat across from her, her eyes threatening to spill the tears she'd held back all night. 

""So,"" Mary said, taking a long drag ""this is it then?""

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please!"" She sucked in a breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could get more time. 

""Please let me have a few more years. I'm not ready to go.""

""Mary, you signed a contr-""

""I know I signed the goddamned contract! I was desperate! I didn't know what else to do!""

She placed her head in her hands and wept, the man patiently waiting for her speak again. She wiped her nose with the back of her hand and placed her cigarette, still smoking, into the ash tray. The man stood and offered a hand to her. 

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

""It's hell, Mary. What do you think it's like?""

------------

Sheriff Thompson stepped out of his patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of the officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size and wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called.""

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbors?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair so I run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Kids?""

""She had a husband and long while ago but he died shortly after their boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin back then and I guess the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin, the next day he's... not.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr Webb nodded, walking back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

------------
The Sheriff walks into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank you, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down at his desk to go over his findings. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""The ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the ashes. They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not singed the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah. We've been going over this case for weeks and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense.""

Josiah sat back a moment, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. Let me ask you something. Have you ever heard of spontaneous human combustion?""",1,1738754088.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1ii7p0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mean-Dragonfruit-959/comments/1ii7p0h/soul_keeper_darlinggun/,Soul Keeper - DarlingGun,"Prologue: Beginning in Hamburg Moni sits in a hidden corner of a McDonald's in central Hamburg. The clatter of cutlery, conversations in German and English, and the hum of the coffee machine all blend into a noisy picture of activity. His story begins on those days. Moni turned 17 a few weeks ago. A big milestone for a boy who has to balance school and work to support his family. Although Hamburg is considered one of the most livable cities in Germany, Moni often feels the place is too stuffy. The story begins one evening. After work, Moni took a bowl and cleared the table and chairs and cleaned the kitchen. The main table in McDonald's is a polished mirror. ‚ÄúMoni, are you done?‚Äù Samir's voice, a stern manager, echoed from behind. ‚ÄúHere it is, I'm almost done.‚Äù Moni replied, quickly wiping the red stains off the table. ‚ÄúGood. But remember to lock the door carefully before leaving.‚Äù Samir reminded and returned to the office. Moni breathed a sigh of relief as Samir disappeared. Looking back in the mirror, he saw that he was having a bad day. Thoughts of the future, family, and the long lonely night became a loop. That evening, Moni decided to take a walk around the Elbe River before returning home. The path leading down to the riverbank was dimly lit, and his mind gradually became lost in undefined questions. As he was crossing the bridge, something unusual happened. Out of the corner of Moni's eye, he caught a glimpse of a blurry figure in the water. ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù Moni whispered. But before he could react, a low voice rang out, as if coming from a very far away place: ‚ÄúMoni, you are the chosen one.‚Äù An unusual sensation made Moni's wrist twitch. Who was speaking? Why did he know his name? It was the first moment he began to understand that his ordinary life was about to be just an easy chapter in a larger story. Meeting in the Dark Moni turned around, but saw no one else on the bridge. The Elbe, glittering in the late night lights, was now eerily cold. A chill crept up his spine. ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Moni muttered. But instead of responding, the voice rang out again, softly whispering in my mind: ‚ÄúYou are about to choose. Fear not, Moni. Your fate is decided.‚Äù Moni's heart was pounding. He felt a cold gaze staring straight at him, but he couldn't see its source. He started walking quickly towards home. However, as he passed a hidden corner, he suddenly stopped. A shadowy figure appeared before Moni. It was a tall, thin woman dressed in all black. Her dark face seemed to hide an indescribable secret. ‚ÄúMoni,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúI have waited a long time for you.‚Äù From there, a dangerous journey began for Moni. Zaria ‚Äì Stranger in the Dark The next morning, Moni returned to McDonald's. Although the strange events of the previous night still haunted him, he told himself that he was probably just tired and imagining things. The strangest thing that day was not the uneasy feeling in Moni's mind, but the appearance of a new employee. Zaria. She was a young woman with long black hair and cold, piercing grey eyes. Zaria appeared cold and quiet, but she worked quickly and efficiently. When Moni entered the kitchen, she just looked up at him, her lips pressed together, saying nothing. ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Moni said first. Zaria just nodded, her gray eyes still strangely fixed on Moni. It felt like she knew something about him, like they had met before. Throughout the workday, Moni felt Zaria watching him. Whenever he turned around, her eyes would dart away. One time, while Moni was cleaning the guest area, Zaria suddenly appeared behind him, startling him. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Her voice was cold but there was no hiding her concern. Moni nodded, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúYeah, I'm fine. Thanks.‚Äù Zaria stood there for a moment, her eyes seemingly wanting to say something but unable to form words. After a few seconds, she turned away, leaving Moni standing there, dumbfounded. The Mission of Satan's Servant In the darkness of her small room, Zaria sat at an old wooden table. A tightly bound book lay open before her, its pages stained with the color of time. On the pages, ancient writing depicted the image of a person - Moni. ‚ÄúYour fate is sealed,‚Äù Zaria whispered, her hands shaking as she turned the pages. Zaria is no ordinary person. She is a servant of Satan, tasked with finding and destroying Moni ‚Äì a man with the special ability to communicate with dead souls. Satan fears that Moni‚Äôs powers will become a great threat if he realizes his true potential. But Zaria was not an emotionless puppet. She tried to strike silently many times, but every time she did, an invisible force stopped her. Whenever she got close to finishing Moni off, the image of his life-filled eyes appeared in her mind. This left Zaria conflicted and hesitant. Zaria doesn't want to hurt him. She begins to sense that Moni may be the key to breaking free from Satan's bondage ‚Äì something she has long desired. Unexpected Allies One night, while Moni was cleaning up McDonald's late, Zaria approached. This time, her eyes were no longer cold as usual, but instead serious. ‚ÄúMoni,‚Äù she said, her voice low but firm. ‚ÄúI need to talk to you.‚Äù Moni turned back, slightly confused by her attitude. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Zaria took a deep breath. ‚ÄúHave you‚Ä¶ ever heard of Satan?‚Äù The question stunned Moni. He shook his head, feeling like something big was coming. ‚ÄúYou are in danger,‚Äù Zaria continued. ‚ÄúAnd I am here to help you.‚Äù Even though he didn't understand what was happening, Moni felt the sincerity in her words. And from that moment, he knew that Zaria was more than just an ordinary colleague. Together, they would embark on a fierce battle against the power that Zaria once served. Warning From Satan That night, in a dark space, Zaria sat in her small room, her hands trembling as she turned the pages of an ancient book. But this time, she was no longer alone. An unusually cold wind blew through the room, and then a deep voice rang out from nowhere. ‚ÄúZaria,‚Äù Satan‚Äôs voice, both authoritative and terrifying, echoed in her head. ‚ÄúYou have delayed too long.‚Äù Zaria bit her lip, her cold eyes looking down at the table, avoiding looking at the invisible entity present in the room. ‚ÄúYou know why I gave you this task,‚Äù Satan continued. ‚ÄúMoni is protected by a powerful shield‚Äîthe power of Allah. But that shield is not permanent. If you want to break through, you must become stronger. Absorb more souls, Zaria. Tonight, I want you to start with Riad.‚Äù Zaria was startled. Riad was Moni's co-worker at McDonald's, a gentle man who always helped others. The thought of taking his life disgusted her, but she dared not show any hesitation. ‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù Zaria replied curtly, trying to keep her voice calm. Satan was silent for a moment, as if he was examining her mind. Then, his voice became colder. ‚ÄúIf you hesitate any longer, I will personally deal with you. Don‚Äôt forget, you cannot escape from me.‚Äù As Satan's presence disappeared, Zaria collapsed into her chair, cold sweat running down her forehead. She was conflicted. She knew that following Satan's orders would lead to dire consequences, but not following them would mean her own destruction.",1,1738753982.0,u_Mean-Dragonfruit-959,0,1.0,False
1ii7nxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ii7nxd/rivelia_user_forum/,Rivelia User Forum,"Hello all,

I've had my Rivelia since Xmas and have been messing about a good bit with the settings, trying to get the best drinks out of the machine. Overall, I really like it and am happy with my purchase. Sometimes results can be inconsistent though - I do change beans alot so that will have something to do with it - and think there is more I can do to refine the config and settings optimally.

I've watched James Hoffman's video re getting the most from bean to cup machines and he suggests starting with understanding the dose size. Having checked various sources I haven't found a consensus on this. Across Reddit, you tube (some fella called Gabe), Coffee keV from Coffee Blog and Tom's Corner, I've seen diff info. From my experience, I think an espresso is about 9g on 4 beans. But I could be wrong, it might be less than that. Hoff suggests dialling it up to 5 beans but for me, that's when the matchine starts to have trouble extracting. It could mean that this is when I should start raising the grind level up a notch so it's not so fine, but I've generally had best results following the guidance on grind settings that come from bean adapt.

Moving on to bean adapt, I find it frustrating that this is only used for espresso. If this is how to get the best espresso then it should be the starting point for all espresso based drinks, no? Otherwise you just need to figure it out. From what I can see it suggests medium temp for medium roast (which is typically what I use), and bean setting 4. So, if we were to use Hoffman's guidance, I think the advice would be to take the dose (9g?), ignore bean adapt, and let an espresso flow til the output is 9x4g (using th.my drinks function), and then use this as a starting to experimenting with more or less flow in 5g increments. Then from there, I guess if you are happy with the espresso you use the same timings tomthen set up your other favourite drinks (flat white etc).

I thought it would be useful to start a sub like this so we could share what settings we are getting the most out of, what works best, doesn't work and any other good tips for getting the most out of the machine.  

Pls share any thoughts or insight :)",2,1738753855.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

In December 2023, I decided to move to Ireland with my partner, but since English isn‚Äôt my first and second languages, my speaking skills aren‚Äôt very fluent, so I trained as a barista and learned how to make sushi.

About 9 months ago, I found a job at a fast-food restaurant in Dundalk and worked there for 3 months, but the daily commute between Dundalk and Dublin was too much, so I quit and started looking for a job in Dublin. And honest, it has been a nightmare! I‚Äôve tried everything, applying online, walk in, but aside from 2 bad experiences, I‚Äôve heard nothing back. One time, I went for a barista interview, but they took me to another restaurant and made me do dishwashing, cleaning and food running, saying I had to do that for more than 2 months before they‚Äôd let me make coffee. Another time, I got paid with 20% tax deducted, but they never actually registered my PPS.

I don‚Äôt have many friends here, so I don‚Äôt have friends to refer me. I feel completely hopeless. Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about whether I should just give up and go back to home, maybe that way, at least, my partner and I both have less pressure‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.so I just wonder how do people get hired in Dublin or any advice? Thank you so much.

One regular coffee makes me feel like I've drunk four, so I have to stick to decaff.

I don't normally drink alcohol, but had a whisky the other night for the first time since starting Prozac (20mg) three months ago, and I felt very drunk, very quickly - and downright horrible the next morning! Even after a long period of not drinking, this was an extreme reaction from my body, so I'll be sticking to not drinking again.

In your experience(s), do the two usually go together? Do some people react to caffeine but not alcohol? Or the other way round? I know some people have no side effects at all, I'm curious how common it is to react to both like I seem to.",3,1738753504.0,prozac,1,1.0,False

With many different diets carnivore was the only thing that helped those two health issues for him. He‚Äôs pretty healthy and in good shape. He‚Äôs my biggest support through the last 18 years of being together and he‚Äôs doing this with me. He‚Äôs never gone 100% carnivore before so it‚Äôs nice we can support one another during this journey. Anyways, we‚Äôre on day 3 of 90 and feel pretty good except for me I have a few headaches.

Specialization: Marketing
Slot: 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

Case study at 10:10am, was given the sheets for 20mins. Case study was on living with your parents as a mid 20s working individual, pros and cons. 


G1 started at 11am

Panel: P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)


Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, Bcom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, Bcom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, Bcom graduation, fresher)


Interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go off tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual. 

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)


Actual questions:

TMAY but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more. 


Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness. 

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question but the panelist helped her find her flow and eventually she answered well.


Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had). 

Initially I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones) and I answered well. 


M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied 


M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea of (pardon me for financial illiteracy). 


Questions moved back to me, I was asked how coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some example of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either). 


F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato who notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings. 


M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things). 


F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented. 

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed. 


P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one. 

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results. 


G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take. 

Verdict: Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of wait)


It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at spjimr and such, was fun.


G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.


My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (marketing, workex in Career Launcher)


First question: You're in an elevator will Bill Gates, you have 30s to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him. 

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for mahakumbh? Idfk) so we discussed on the stampede for a little bit.
 
M2 gave an example of Coldplay concert so discussion went there. Asked about what is the hot news about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we got asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it. 


Got a cup from the nice adcom guy and then left, and here I am in the cab typing this. Hope the transcript helps you, goodluck!

1ii7ji8,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ii7ji8/navigating_my_partners_new_relationship_a/,"Navigating My Partner‚Äôs New Relationship: A Rollercoaster of Emotions and Adjustments (Sophia, Daniel and I). Part 2.","Hey everyone,

After my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ihkgfb/how_do_you_handle_your_partner_sleeping_with/) about navigating my partner sleeping with someone else under our shared roof, and after reading through so many insightful responses, I wanted to take a step back and summarize the situation more clearly.

More importantly, I want to focus on my **feelings** because, if I‚Äôm being honest, this whole process has been emotionally draining. **I feel torn between wanting to be supportive of my partner‚Äôs new relationship and struggling with my own emotions in adapting to it.** This mix of feelings has taken a toll on my mental stability, but I also believe working through this will bring growth in my relationship with Sophia.

# The Context: Why This Has Been So Difficult for Me

My partner, **Sophia (29F), and I (26M) have been together for 8 years** in an open relationship. We‚Äôve had different experiences throughout the years‚Äîgroup experiences, separate flings‚Äîbut we had never faced a situation where one of us was starting to have **a meaningful connection with someone else.**

Then **Daniel (34M) entered the picture.** Sophia met him recently, and she‚Äôs clearly **developing a strong attraction**‚Äîher first **real crush.**

Over these past years, I‚Äôve had **multiple casual partners**, but Sophia just **wasn‚Äôt feeling attracted to anyone.** The last time she had a new sexual partner was about 2 years ago I think. A lot of that had to do with her **mental health struggles, medication changes, and simply not being in a place where she wanted to engage romantically or sexually with new people.**

So when she finally felt this **spark** again, I wanted to **support it,** even though I wasn‚Äôt yet sure how to fully process my emotions around it. I didn‚Äôt want to be the reason she held back or missed out on something that was making her happy after such a long time.

That‚Äôs **why I didn‚Äôt stop her from sleeping with Daniel at our apartment after a party.** We were hosting a **birthday party for a mutual friend,** and Daniel was part of the group. Everyone was drinking, the night was winding down, and at some point, **Sophia and Daniel went to her bedroom.**

For the first hour, I wasn‚Äôt completely alone‚ÄîI still had two friends hanging out in the living room with me, which helped delay the emotions. But **once they left and I was alone, everything hit me at once.**

# That First Night: A Flood of Mixed Emotions

At first, I was **curious**‚ÄîI wanted to know what was happening. Then, I felt **left out.** Then, I felt **lonely.**

I ended up **knocking on their door and asking, ‚ÄúCan I join you guys?‚Äù**

They bluntly said **‚ÄúNo.‚Äù**

That stung‚Äînot because I didn‚Äôt understand why, but because in that moment, I felt **completely shut out.** I wasn‚Äôt looking to ‚Äúforce‚Äù anything, but I think I just needed some sort of acknowledgment. Instead, **I felt rejected and alone.**

After that, I tried to sleep but found myself **hovering near their bedroom, just listening.** It wasn‚Äôt my proudest moment, but it was the only way I could process what was happening. There was a mix of **arousal and discomfort, compersion and jealousy, acceptance and resistance.**

In the morning, they were still having sex, and I found myself **masturbating to the sounds of them together.** Again, **a weird mix of emotions**‚Äîpart of me was turned on, part of me felt like I was stuck outside of something I should have been okay with.

Eventually, I got up, **cleaned the entire apartment, bought them croissants, and made coffee** before they emerged from the bedroom around 3 PM. From the outside, it must have looked like **I was totally fine with it,** but internally, I was still processing everything.

# The Aftermath: Why This Has Been So Difficult for Me

After that night, I realized that **just being ‚Äúokay‚Äù with Sophia having other partners wasn‚Äôt enough.**

**The logistics, the communication, the emotional management‚Äîall of it mattered more than I expected.**

That‚Äôs when I started **trying to find solutions** to make this easier. But here‚Äôs where I **now realize I went wrong**:

* I started **doing all the emotional labor** to make their relationship work in a way that didn‚Äôt hurt me.
* I was **the only one actively looking for ways to make this comfortable**, while Sophia and Daniel weren‚Äôt doing much problem-solving themselves. They didn't explicitely ask for me to find solutions, but  Sophia was still asking me during the last week: ""Can I tell Daniel he can stay overnight here whenever he wants to?""
* I was **prioritizing their needs over mine**‚Äîconvincing myself that I had to be the one making sacrifices so they could be together comfortably.

# A Personal Factor: Feeling a Bit Left Out

Another thing that has been making this whole situation emotionally harder is that I **haven‚Äôt really had a similar experience myself.**

The closest I got was with a girl, let's called her Am√©lie. I had a big crush on at some point. I really wanted to spend time with her, sleep with her, explore a deeper connection. We slept together a couple of times, hung out some more for about 3-4 months. But looking back, I don‚Äôt think the attraction was mutual. She didn‚Äôt really engage or communicate much, and in the end, it all quickly fell apart before anything truly started

So, seeing Sophia **fully experiencing this exciting new connection with Daniel** while I never really got to experience something like that myself makes me feel a bit **left out.** I don‚Äôt resent her for it‚ÄîI know it‚Äôs just how things played out‚Äîbut it adds another layer to my feelings around this.

# My Shift in Mindset: Setting Boundaries, Not Just Making Accommodations

After talking with Sophia (and reading some very eye-opening comments), I‚Äôve realized that I **need to stop being the main ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù of their relationship.**

‚úÖ **I am no longer going to be the one figuring out logistics for them.**  
‚úÖ **If they want this to work, they need to put in the effort to make it work without it being at my expense.**  
‚úÖ **I will communicate my boundaries clearly and expect them to be respected.**  
‚úÖ **If at any point, this arrangement doesn‚Äôt work for me, I won‚Äôt force myself to be okay with it.**

I still **want Sophia to be happy**, I still want to be **supportive**, but I‚Äôm done **pushing my own comfort to the side just to make their relationship easier.**

# What Still Scares Me About the Future

This whole situation has made me realize that **polyamory isn‚Äôt just about saying you‚Äôre okay with something‚Äîit‚Äôs about actively managing emotions, logistics, and unexpected challenges.**

Right now, I feel:

* **A little scared** about how this will evolve, and whether this will shake the foundation of my relationship with Sophia.
* **A little hurt** that I was so quick to accommodate, while they didn‚Äôt initially make as much effort in return.
* **A little excited** to see how this could help me grow and make our relationship stronger.
* **A little drained** from all the mental processing I‚Äôve had to do in such a short time.

At the same time, **I know that having these hard conversations is what will make us stronger**‚Äîeither by bringing us closer, or by making it clear where we each stand in terms of our needs and boundaries.

# Looking for Advice: Has Anyone Else Been in a Similar Position?

I‚Äôd love to hear from people who have gone through a similar situation.

* **How did you balance your own comfort with your partner‚Äôs freedom?**
* **How did you manage the logistics without feeling like you were the only one making adjustments?**
* **What helped you process complicated emotions in a way that was healthy?**

I know this is a long post, but I wanted to give the full picture. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read, and to those who commented on my first post‚Äîit really helped me shift my perspective and set healthier boundaries.

Would love to hear from others who have walked a similar path. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1738753312.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

I have to be honest I was expecting it and happy with the rejection. The interview was the worst experience. The first thing that should have been a red flag was that they scheduled me specifically on a day I said I could not attend. I was excited though and made it work. I had to spend a lot of money on a flight and car rental to get there. There were no directions in the building on where to go. When we got there we found out that despite being told it wouldn't go over a certain time the last group would definitely be there at least a hour after the time they told us and people were on edge about making their flights home. I had to ask to switch groups due to possibly not making my flight. Most of the time (5 hours) you just sat there. There was nothing to eat or drink besides cold coffee from hours before. I got there a few hours early and watched them bring it in at least 2 hours before the start time. The group activity was a joke. I couldn't get a word in as the others talked over each other. The mini interviews were the worst part. The first station for me was comparative anatomy and they had a blurry blown up picture of a chicken skeleton. The lady treated me like an idiot for thinking it was a large bird instead of knowing it was a chicken. There were two stations where I got yelled at by the alumni who interviewed me. One was during a role play scenario where it showed how you handled disgruntled clients. She definitely took her role too far. At that point I was exhausted and annoyed and knew I wasn't going to RVC. I think I shocked when I decided to get sassy back just for the fun of it. I mean half of me wanted to just walk out. The very next station was where you tell a guy how to build a Lego set. He didn't give me the instructions at first. Then I used my finger to point and he yelled at me that I wasn't allowed to do that. Literally yelled at me. I walked out and said to my dad who went with me that I'm not getting in and I'm 100% fine with that. I just felt like the overall experience was a horrible waste of time, money and energy. There were a ton of red flags that I saw from the experience where I knew that I didn't want to go to RVC. It was disorganized and unprofessional. If that's the interview I didn't want to see how the school functions. I just wish I knew before going to the interview what I was in for. I wouldn't have gone. Hopefully this helps someone in the future. ",1,1738753308.0,vetschool,0,1.0,False

So recently some shitty ""friends"" left me \[27 M\] stranded in a city four hours away from my house with no way to get back, meaning I had to take a ridiculously expensive flight. TSA sucked as always, flight was delayed by an hour, and the girl at the coffee shop counter didn't want to talk to me. Airport blues.

Anyway, we FINALLY took off and I put in some headphones to relax to some Amnesiac. Everything is going fine, but right around the part in Knives Out when he mentions the mouse for the first time a fucking baby started crying. I'm a big audiophile so I have these sweet headphones for travel, but the sound wormed its way under them anyway.

The plane is collectively groaning. The guy next to me even gave up up on sleeping. I figured it was time for me to lighten the mood and help drown out the sound.

So, I unplugged my headphones and started playing some more Radiohead. I think it's onto Morning Bell by this point.

Everyone on the plane was quietly jammin along (except for the guy next to me who would NOT stop staring), though this fucking baby is just getting progressively louder. Gotta pull out the big guns for this one.

I felt like the mood kinda changed when I put on Pulk/Pull? Like, everyone started looking at me but nobody asked who the artist was or anything. But Pulk/Pull is pretty avant garde, so they may have just been stunned by the depth.

Then this bitchy flight attendant walks up and tells me to turn it off. I told her absolutely not, this baby was driving me and everyone else crazy and I'm really just lightening the mood and sharing good music. She didn't even acknowledge what I said? Just told me to turn it off again. I asked her if she heard me the first time, and she said she had, and told me to turn it off AGAIN and that now she would need to take the phone for the flight.

I think this is really where I messed up. Some guy from the back of the plane shouted at me to give her the phone. And in a moment of weakness, I caved. I gave her what she wanted.

Once she walked away, I immediately regretted the decision. I knew that I had compromised on my own beliefs and values by not standing up for what was right. But then I came to a revelation: I still had the support of the people. You see, voicing support for me would be more difficult than trying to heckle me, as standing up to someone in power over you (the flight attendant) is harder than siding with them. I had the silent majority with me. And now it was time to rally the troops. I unbuckled my seat belt and stood up with my shoulders back. If they wouldn't let me play the music, I'll make it.

""I'M A CREEP! I'M A WEIRDO-O-O! C'mon, with me everyone! If you like Radiohead now is the time to join me! WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE!""

Surprisingly, nobody joined in, but it looked like I pissed off some normies. No matter. They were always going to be collateral. But the vicious flight attendant was scurrying her way back to my aisle, and the guy in the back yelled some kind of threat. I knew the only thing I could do was sing louder, prouder; to lead the people into a war of righteousness on behalf of all Radiohead fans and kids that were bullied in high school.

""I DON'T BELONG HEREEEEEE!"" All of my passion was put into the music, desperately crying out for aid.

""SIR, your behavior is affecting all of our passengers on the flight. I NEED you to sit down. We all want to reach our destination safe and sound, right?""

""I'LL DIE ON THIS HILL, I AM LEADING THE PEOPLE INTO A WAR OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ON BEHALF OF ALL RADIOHEAD FANS AND KIDS THAT WERE BULLIED IN HIGH SCHOOL!"" This part was extra embarrassing because I think a lot of people who knew the song thought I didn't know the next lyric and was making up stuff. It was already a problem they didn't recognize my leadership due to originally caving, but this was the nail in the coffin.

""You need to SIT the fuck DOWN before I fucking MAKE YOU,"" the guy next to me hissed. And that is when I understood his true intent. Sit Down? What a genius code phrase. I was using the wrong song, and he knew it.

""Ahaha, good one. Your secret is safe with me,"" I whispered back and winked at him, ""This one is for both of us.""

""Theraindrops theraindrops theraindrops theraindrops theraindrops theraindrops theraindrops theraindrops-""

""FUCKING CUFF THIS GUY!"" The guy in the back again. Typical follower. Addicted to any semblance of power. A shame. He broke my concentration, too, so I would have to start at the beginning of the raindrops part. Unfortunately, I never got the chance. The bitchy flight attendant told me that if I kept going they would arrest me when we landed. I had to accept defeat, this time.

The rest of the flight was okay, I guess. The baby stopped crying after like 10 minutes afterwards. I tried humming a couple times but the guy next to me kept glancing at me angrily. Probably because his plan didn't work and he was blaming me for it. Not my fault he thought a Hail to the Thief song would be more effective! Though when I got off the stupid flight attendant told me I was banned from flying with them.

I just don't understand how this happened? Do you think Radiohead is just so underrated the passengers didn't know the lyrics to sing with me? The ones that did were obviously too intimidated to say anything, I mean that guy had to give me a CODE WORD. I guess the whole event also made me realize how much the people in power want to suppress Radiohead's music. I mean, do you know how much organizational power they would have to have to get flight attendants in on it? Anyway, thanks for being a safe space for me to post this.

I'm really struck by all the stories here and how cruel the world can be. Your stories brought tears to my eyes and I feel like sharing mine.

January 6th, 2025 was like any other holiday for me. I was excited to drive back to university and go back to my routines. My boyfriend and I spent lots of time together - we cooked, visitied his parents for new year's, watched movies and went shopping. It was amazing.

He was severely mentally ill. His therapist suspected bipolar disorder. He just started it two months earlier and told me that I don't have to worry any more as he is in good hands now. I was worried because he attempted already in september and october. He didn't get severely injured thankfully - but that allowed him to cover it up. I was the only person that knew everything. About the attempts, the childhood neglect and his abusive roommate he had before I convinced him to move out.

""If I really want to do it, you will not be able to stop me"" - He said in september as I begged him to make an emergency plan. At least he was honest with me and himself. After his second attempt he finally got a therapist. But it turns out he didn't go as often as he should have. Everything else was more important - his job and his reputation. Admitting being mentally ill and going to clinic was something he didn't want to do.

""When are you coming?"" He texted me that morning.

On that day I wanted to stop by and kiss him good bye before I drove off to university. We drank a coffee, chatted about our plans for february and so on. He said that he was exhausted and I told him to relax and enjoy his extra week off vacation he took. If he felt bad, he could always come visit me, I offered. ""No thanks, I want to save up money and I have appointments this week anyway."" he rejected. When I left he gave me a hug and we kissed. Before I walked out the door frame, he held me back kissed me again and told me that he loves me. When I went to my car he stood at the window smiling and waving me goodbye. This is the last time I saw him alive. When I arrived at my appartment I texted him that the traffic was okay. ""Very good"" he answered, as casual as always. An hour later I checked in on what he did. He sent me a picture of watching TV. One hour later, without me suspecting a single thing, he died.

The only way I found out about when it happened was because he filmed it. After I alarmed the police and told his parents that he didn't respond any more, they saw his Ipad being pointed at his corpse. They took it and told us what happened.

He didn't fight it. If he wanted to he could have just pushed the door open, but he didn't. The Police said that it was cold, calculated and that ""he let himself fall"". I just hope that it wasn't too painful and that his brain did everything it could to give him a ""nice"" death experience.

In that moment he only thought of himself and his trauma. If he thought about me, his sister, his parents - he would have stopped. But in that moment he just wanted it to end and this time no one was there to stop him.

""You are a bit naive"" - that's how he called me on our first date in 2023. And he was right in the end. I was naive to believe that my everything was enough to help him. That a little therapy would make him stay in this world. That his reassurances and all the ""we get throught this together"" meant that we would have an happy end.

We wanted to move in together in 2026, to get married - build a life. He was my first love and I'm still in love with him and the Idea to live on for one, ten, twenty, forty years without him crushes my soul.",3,1738753099.0,SuicideBereavement,2,1.0,False

Last fall I went through a spiritual journey with a shaman whose abilities are beyond reproach. What I saw and the information I was given cannot be unseen or unlearned. I guess I was spiritually awakened, at least on some level.

2 weeks ago I was in my kitchen making coffee, and it just blurted out of me out of nowhere, ""I miss my library!"". Needless to say, I was surprised...

 I suddenly felt sadness being detached from some kind of body of information I was used to having, apparently. The impulse was slightly ""me"", but mostly not ""me"", or rather another unknown part of me, if that makes sense.

Then 3 min. later I'm in my living room and as I walk across it this impulse conveys without words, ""nothing but a sack of meat"". I instantly knew it was another part of me having a derogatory comment. I was stunned, and then I got really really angry with what I guess is the soul essence of me observing. I felt like a mere puppet being harvested for emotions and experience in this lifetime, and that felt so abusive to me.

It really made me question if we're mere avatars/puppets in different reincarnations instead of returning to the Afterlife either identical to or more or less ourselves. Some NDE reports mention that the person feels more and more detached to Earth and loved ones the further the experience lasts. So is that just a form of gentle ""mindwipe"", rinse and repeat? Are we mere drones harvesting joy, tears, victory and defeats for the benefit of a soul who views us as tools? That thought angers me to no end!

Initial Money earning way for a teen



How to Make $10K Per Month as a Teenager (12 Ideas For 2025)

There are many ways for teens to start earning money, such as babysitting, dog walking, lawn care, or doing odd jobs for neighbors. Additionally, online opportunities like freelance work, content creation, or taking surveys can also be great options to explore. Popular Job Options for Teens

Babysitting: A classic choice, babysitting allows teens to earn money while caring for children. Rates can vary, but many charge around $14-$15 per hour, especially with certifications in first aid or babysitting courses.

Dog Walking and Pet Sitting: For animal lovers, offering dog walking services or pet sitting can be a fun way to earn money. Apps like Rover can help connect you with clients.

Lawn Care and Yard Work: Seasonal yard work, such as mowing lawns or raking leaves, can be lucrative. Teens can charge around $20 per hour, depending on the task and area.

Tutoring: If you excel in a particular subject, consider tutoring younger students. Rates typically range from $20 per hour, and sessions can be held in person or online.

Retail and Food Service Jobs: Many grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants hire teens for part-time positions. These jobs provide valuable customer service experience and often come with perks like discounts.

Creative Side Hustles

Baking and Selling Treats: Teens can bake cookies, cupcakes, or other treats to sell at local events or online. Pricing should cover ingredient costs and time spent.

Crafting and Selling Handmade Goods: If you‚Äôre crafty, consider making and selling items like jewelry, candles, or artwork. Platforms like Etsy can help you reach a wider audience.

Content Creation: Teens can create content for platforms like YouTube or TikTok. With engaging videos, you can earn money through ad revenue or sponsorships.

Freelance Services: Skills in graphic design, writing, or social media management can be monetized through freelance platforms. Teens can offer services to local businesses or online clients.

Online Opportunities

Taking Surveys: Participating in online surveys can provide some extra cash or gift cards. However, be cautious of scams and never share sensitive information.

Game Testing: For those who enjoy gaming, testing video games for bugs can be a paid opportunity. Rates typically range from $15-$18 per hour.

Virtual Tutoring: Online tutoring platforms allow teens to teach subjects they excel in, providing flexibility and the ability to reach students beyond their local area.

Selling Unwanted Items: Teens can declutter their rooms and sell old electronics, clothes, or other items through apps and websites, making some extra cash in the process.",1,1738752609.0,StartEarns,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm between two apartments. Here are some pros and cons of both. They both have heating/AC, in unit laundry, and assigned covered parking.

Apartment 1: ~$1700/mo, 682 sqft
Pros: 
-super nice amenities, beer and wine on tap, pickleball court (I love), 24/hr gym, conference and study areas, snack and drinks stocked, nice coffee/espresso machine, entertainment area with tvs and couches, outdoor heated and covered lounge area
-great and safe neighborhood
-brand new apts
-great reviews on management, apartment safety and security, maintenance is responsive
-hold several clubhouse activities and food truck parties every month. Like a superbowl party is happening this weekend with food, refreshments, etc
-very good specials going on rn, 6 weeks free rent
-near very serene water area with hiking path around it
Cons:
-does not include anything, like water, elec, sewer, etc, WiFi, in rent
-very small apartment, hard to host friends
-cabinets and appliances are average
-small-ish pool and hot tub
I see myself enjoying the amenities a lot, especially pickleball, and staying around the club house for various things. Basically all the things outside of the actual apartment, because of how small it is.

Apartment 2: ~$1650/mo, 857sqft (not sure if water, sewage, is included in rent)
Pros:
-large size apartment, big enough for me to host and have space to move around
-nice appliances, countertops, cabinets
-another safe area, similar to apt 1
-large pool and hot tub
-24hr gym, coffee machine. Club house is more of a normal leasing office.
-electric fireplace, smart home features
Cons:
-reviews include those of poor management, package stealing from porches and mail area. Maintenance also seems to be difficult.
-reports of dirty/damaged apartments with staff ignoring reports and not fixing these things before tenants moved in, new tenants then pushed to find their own solution by calling cleaning people or fixing carpet on their own
-no activities from the club house or staff. Leasing office seems to just be an office.
-gym is small, no weights
-reports of tenants not picking up after their dogs
I‚Äôd love to live here for the apartment mainly, the size is great, the interior is beautiful and also has amazing windows. I would basically only rent for the apartment, but am worried about the package stealing and reports of poor management. 

Basically, TLDR, would you rent an apartment for its amenities, or for the actual apartment?? One place I see myself outside of my apartment a lot, and the other I would see myself inside the apartment a lot. I am still leaning towards apt 2, but the bad reviews are very worrying to me.

For those who are unaware, I am not talking about the powdered form that is cocaine. I am talking about coca leaf that grows naturally. 

Coca leaf, in its raw natural form is no more harmful than a cup of coffee. It has antioxidant properties, helps with altitude sickness, respiratory issues, and non-addictive unlike its powdered form of cocaine. It has no narcotic or intoxicant effects when consumed in its leaf form. Many native people of South America chew coca leaf as a fundamental part of their culture without any risk of overdose, abuse or addiction. The health risks that powdered cocaine has is not even comparable to natural coca leaf, which has little to no risks. In terms of physiological effects, it is more similar to coffee, a legal mild stimulant. If coffee is socially and legally accepted, then so should coca leaf. 

Although coca leaf should be legal to consume, I do believe that there should be legal safeguards in preventing coca leaf from being synthesized into cocaine, which is an addictive and hazardous chemical. Each person should only be allowed to legally possess small amounts to prevent the manufacturing of cocaine. There should be warning labels when selling coca leaf, telling consumers that converting coca leaf into cocaine is still a crime and punishable by law. Only licensed personnel should be allowed by law to cultivate coca leaves, with full legal disclosure to ensure that none of the plants get converted to cocaine. 

With that being said, I still believe cocaine should remain illegal. ",7,1738752474.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,3,1.0,False

# Context:

* We've known each other for about 6Ms through work.
* Both of us are INTJ-A. I am a F and a few years older than he is. He dated briefly before but is currently single and not dating to my knowledge.
* Initially noticed him for his good manners, rigorous work ethic, and directness. He also appears more mature than most men his age.
* We've hung out alone twice. He initiated the 1st and I initiated the 2nd. Neither of us said it was a date. Both times were completely platonic. We spent the whole morning/afternoon in museums, had coffee afterwards, had delightful conversations, and shared random things we knew. No intimate physical contact. The last time we hung out, he walked me to the station. I initiated a hug before leaving. Then he stood watching me through the window until the train departed. That's kinda old-fashioned and sweet.

# Cues I've picked up

* We rarely engage in non-work chitchat but he is highly responsive when I reach out. He normally replies quickly.
* In work settings, he appears to make an effort to prolong one-on-one time with me. He seems happy to engage in long brainstorming discussions even when they could be cut short. In group meetings, he often suggests wrapping up early.
* Displays some nervousness. He sometimes gets blushed when teased and seems to show excessive formality compared to how he interacts with others (more relaxed).
* At company events (parties and grp meetings), he usually sits right next to me if possible. I occasionally catch his gaze (I did that to him as well).
* He‚Äôs shared extensive personal details about his family, shown me his photos w/ his family and cats, shared books he read, and sought my personal opinions on a potential career pivot.
* Outwardly, he seems ambitious, socially adept, self-driven, and exhibits strong leadership. But he has explicitly mentioned to me that he is quite shy (sadly I am the same, like a coward). Based on my own experiences and observations, INTJs (both M & F) tend to be passive, reserved, and hesitant in romantic pursuits. The more experienced ones may handle it better, but many seem stuck in analysis paralysis.

# Final Thoughts

I've read similar posts, and there are quite a few behavioral ‚Äúchecks‚Äù here (i.e: personal sharing, willingness for alone time, etc.). Besides, I'm FULLY aware of the go-to INTJ advice: just ask\*.\*

BUT‚Ä¶ we all know that workplace dynamics complicate things. I also have no interest in making a fool of myself or creating unnecessary awkwardness. Additionally, our dynamic has been largely **professional and platonic,** so unlike the typical dynamics spotted in modern dating/romance. Hence I do find it hard to gauge whether this is just an INTJ being an INTJ, showing interest more than a colleague/friend, or just me overthinking. My hunch is that he seems to like me.

I feel terrible because I‚Äôm afraid that he thinks that I‚Äôve lead him on.

I (20, F) just rejected a guy (27) I had been dating with. For context, we've been talking for about three months and been on two dates, have seen each other regularly at uni and studied together and have had two or three spontaneous coffee/walking dates. He texts me daily and likes to call and have long political conversations in which I don't get to say a lot (l.e. he likes to talk more than listen). Partially because of this I feel unattracted to him. He talks a lot but I feel that he actually knows very little about me. I never thought he was physically attractive, which is part of the reason why, the first time he asked me out, I politely rejected him saying I was looking for something serious and, considering I was busy with uni and studying medicine, I wasn't ready for something serious. I told him I wanted to prevent leading him on or hurting him and therefore it‚Äôd be better not to date. He asked if we could talk about this in real life during something which ended up being a date after all. After this he convinced me that it would be a pity to let real potential go just because ""you don't feel ready"". So, I agreed to see where things would go and to potentially go on more dates. After all, he did have characteristics I found important and I really wanted to try to feel more for him (he‚Äôs ambitious, respectful, kind, hard working‚Ä¶) 
During our first date he was already pretty physical. He immediately held my hand, which, to me, is super intimate. I am a person who struggles saying no and who tends to be a great empath and forgets to think about herself. So, I let him hold my hand and pretended like it was something normal in the hopes that he wouldn‚Äôt give much meaning to it. When he wanted to hug me, I also let him, all while feeling very awkward and getting the ick during forms of physical contact. He has never tried to kiss me, because I think he notices I get awkward and have never initiated physical contact myself. I‚Äôve noticed he finds it difficult when I set boundaries and gets persistent in getting his way. One time he wanted to read me something but I had terrible period cramps, I told him I wanted to go home but he kept begging to tell me. I think for me, subconsciously, this made me uncomfortable rejecting him because he makes me feel bad in order to get his way.
Now, this week, I‚Äôve discovered that I genuinely don‚Äôt think my feelings will develop and decided to end things ASAP. We've tried meeting up for a while now, but our schedule won't let us. We haven‚Äôt seen each other in more than three weeks because of this (our contact has been via phone). He‚Äôs already a doctor and, like me, very busy with work and studying to become a surgeon. I just couldn't wait telling him I don't feel the ""spark"" because time keeps going by this way and it would feel as if I was leading him on. So, I decided to send him a voice note saying ‚ÄúI wanted to say this real life, but our schedule won‚Äôt let us‚Äù and that I didn‚Äôt opt for a phone call because I was afraid I would forget to mention things and wouldn‚Äôt be able to say what I needed to say. I told him I wasn‚Äôt feeling the attraction even though I have really tried feeling it and wanted things to work out. I mentioned I didn‚Äôt see the point in dating someone when you‚Äôve tried to feel it but it‚Äôs just not working. I also said (twice) that if he wanted to talk about it in real life i was here for him. He responded with ‚ÄúThanks for your clarity, good of you to mention‚Äù 
Now, I know that as soon as I noticed my attraction REALLY wasn‚Äôt coming I decided to end things, but I can‚Äôt help but feel so guilty ever since. I can‚Äôt sleep because of it and I keep dreaming about things related to this. I‚Äôve been nauseous the last two days. I‚Äôm just so afraid that he feels that I‚Äôve lead him on, also in regards to allowing that physical contact. I know that he seriously liked me and was hoping things would work out, he‚Äôd mention that regularly. My question is.. am I an asshole in this situation?

So here's the game: You find or recall a quote from an episode of Trek you enjoy, hate, or find mediocre. You put it in a comment. We reply to the comment without looking up the quote and being a dirty cheater. Or do whatever you want.

Rules

1) Nothing obtuse like ""Make it so"" or ""Coffee.""

 2) Nothing obvious like that monologue from the end of that DS9 episode, or, ""They're Beings, Trelane. They have spirit. They're superior.""

3) Keep the quote short, like ""All these years, the hermit of La Barre. Now suddenly he's inescapable.""

So I‚Äôve known this guy for 3ish years. He asked me out at one point when I had a boyfriend so that was an easy no. We got closer when said boyfriend and I broke up a little over a year ago. A mutual friend told him I was single and he took that as a big opportunity to ask me on a date, give me his number, and talk to me all day everyday. Since then, my sister has started going to the same church as him. She and all our mutual friends think he‚Äôs simply the perfect guy. The issue here is that he‚Äôs the opposite of my type.

He‚Äôs incredibly nice. Like so nice that it‚Äôs a turn off. But it makes me feel bad distancing myself. He‚Äôs asked me on a date and/or told me he has feelings for me approximately 6 times in the last year. Every time I turn him down and he still keeps snapping or texting me daily and always says something like ‚ÄúI really appreciate you being so kind and understanding‚Äù after I turn him down. This man will respond in 30 seconds and double text hours later when I take 5-6 hours to respond.

My issues: to start I‚Äôm simply not physically attracted to him. And call me shallow but I‚Äôm 22 and know that I have options and I‚Äôm not in a rush to find someone immediately. Like I said before he‚Äôs so nice that it‚Äôs a turn off. Constantly offering to get me coffee or food, constantly asking if I need anything, wanting movie nights, asking how I‚Äôm feeling, telling me he‚Äôll pray for me and be thinking of me when I say that somethings wrong. Even after I say no to these things 80% of the time. He‚Äôs wayyy too innocent for me. I‚Äôm talking church twice a week (when I haven‚Äôt consistently been in years), 29 year old virgin (I‚Äôm literally a single mom at 22), always too forgiving and doesn‚Äôt have a mean bone in his body meaning he can hardly stick up for himself, and more that I‚Äôm forgetting I‚Äôm sure. All qualities I love in a friend, hate in a partner. 

This man‚Äôs obsession with me is also a major turn off. He‚Äôs told friends that he thinks I hung the moon and he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever get over me. He told me initially when we became friends that he never wanted kids and then told myself and friends that he would make an exception for me when I got pregnant. He hasn‚Äôt stopped asking me out and expressing his feelings even since I‚Äôve said no many times. 

I don‚Äôt know how to keep turning him down. I don‚Äôt know how to keep a friendship with someone so unbelievably nice when he honestly makes me kind of uncomfortable. He frequently calls me pretty, saying he appreciates my friendship, telling me I light up his world and he‚Äôs thankful that I‚Äôm in his life, and just always showing affection when I barely reciprocate. At this point I respond to him out of courtesy because I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings. Dropping him as a friend would make things awkward when I have to see him a few times a year at social gatherings.
