Don’t let charisma or credentials shortcut your future: interview at least three candidates, gather six or seven names, and vet them through FINRA BrokerCheck and the SEC’s IAPD. Chemistry matters, but so does proof—ask for concrete examples of how they handled Social Security claiming, Medicare choices, childcare tradeoffs, student-loan strategies or other issues you face. If an advisor rambles, uses jargon, or can’t explain their process in plain language, move on—confusion is a feature of bad planning, not a bug. Demand fiduciary status (CFP is the gold standard), check for CPAs or EAs when taxes matter, and look for RICPs when retirement income is your primary risk. Compensation must be simple and transparent; if they dodge “How do I pay you?” they’re selling complexity. Remember switching is painful, so get it right first: treat consultations like interviews, not coffee chats. Your financial partner should ask the hard questions, show relevant case experience, and give clear, actionable answers. Settling for the first “nice” person guarantees mediocre outcomes, not security.

1oqqibx,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1oqqibx/he_looked_right_at_me_and_i_swear_the_world/,"""He looked right at me and I swear the World slowed down.""","It was around 5.30 in the evening when I found myself at the cafe near campus, the place half full and washed in that perfect blend of golden sunset and warm yellow lights. I’d gone there to grab a chocolate smoothie while waiting for my friend, whose “five minutes” text had already stretched into twenty. Sitting near the window, I scrolled through my phone with my earphones in, pretending to be busy. The cafe smelled like coffee and caramel  the kind of scent that somehow made waiting feel comforting.

A little while later, a guy walked in someone I’d seen once or twice around campus. He had his AirPods in, a notebook tucked under his arm, and after ordering a sandwich, sat at the table right next to mine. We exchanged those accidental glances  the ones that happen too often to be truly accidental and each time, we both looked away a little too quickly. Once, I caught him smiling to himself, and I immediately buried my attention into my smoothie like it was the most fascinating thing in the world.

At one point, he got up to grab some tissues, and on his way back, he paused by my table. I looked up, and he gave me this calm, easy smile that somehow made me relax. He introduced himself as Rahul and asked if I was from the same university, which I confirmed with a small smile. He laughed softly, saying he’d seen me a few times  usually waiting for the same perpetually late friend. That made me laugh too, and when I said my friend was at least consistent, he grinned and told me that consistency was a virtue, joking that I seemed like the patient one. I told him maybe I’d just accepted fate, which made him laugh again.

There was something effortlessly comfortable about the way he talked  light, friendly, never awkward. He mentioned he was in his final year, and when I said I was in my second, he nodded in that knowing senior way, saying he’d probably seen me around, that I always seemed a little lost in my own world. I didn’t know how to respond, but it didn’t feel strange. He had that kind of energy that made silence feel okay.

My phone buzzed just then my friend had finally arrived. I stood up, telling him I should go, and he smiled, saying it was nice talking to me. I smiled back, said the same, and started walking toward the door. That’s when he called out softly, asking me to wait. When I turned around, he was still smiling, a little amused, a little shy. He told me I looked really cute when I was trying not to make eye contact. For a second, I froze, my face warm with embarrassment and something I couldn’t quite name. Then I laughed before quickly turning away.

As I stepped out of the cafe, I realized my heart was racing. I couldn’t stop smiling; my hands were actually trembling a little with that fluttery, stupidly happy feeling that sneaks up on you out of nowhere. And for the first time in a long while, for the first time I'm happy for my friend being late...",0,1762509845.0,hyderabad,3,0.5,False

I’m 21 and about to open a small take-away coffee shop in Spain — no seating, just quick service.

What makes it different is that we’ll serve only flavored coffees (vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, coconut, chocolate, etc.) — that’s the full concept. I want it to feel unique and consistent instead of offering the same generic menu as every other café.

Here’s where I’m at:
	•	Average ticket: ~€3.6
	•	Break-even: ~100 coffees/day
	•	Prices:
• Small €2.90
• Medium €3.50
• Large €3.80
• Special milk or syrup +€0.40

I’m trying to lower that break-even by improving workflow and perceived value, not cutting costs.

Would really appreciate advice on:
	•	Efficient bar setup for take-away
	•	Whether my pricing looks balanced
	•	Subscription or loyalty systems that actually work
	•	Cold drinks that fit a flavored coffee concept
	•	Any real-world lessons from people who’ve opened small coffee spots

I’m currently on an exchange program in China. Back in my home country I have quite a few friends and I’ve always considered myself someone who gets along easily with different kinds of people. I like things like video games, crafts, reading, music, random chatting etc  I’m always open to trying new hobbies ^^

Since I arrived here, it’s been kinda hard to make ""real"" friends. I do talk to people, and sometimes hang out with classmates or go to events, even though I have a good time it's hard to feel a ""genuine"" connection, like we actually click. It’s been a little bit tough honestly. I try to stay positive but lately I’ve been feeling quite lonely.

So I thought… maybe I’m not the only one feeling this way. If anyone else is going through something similar — whether you’re an exchange student or not — or has some recommendations... maybe we could meet up for coffee, go for a walk, visit new places, play games, or just chat about life and how we all ended up here in China, everything is well welcomed :)

I don’t want to share too many personal details here, but I’m open to meeting anyone, regardless of nationality, age, or gender.

1oqqfam,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1oqqfam/pearl_boba/,Pearl Boba!!,"Okay so our top food review this time is something that I’ve been obsessed with for a while — Boba.

I’ve been a Boba fan ever since it got popular (you know that era when everyone suddenly had a Boba in their hand?). But honestly, my first few tries were such a disappointment. I couldn’t understand what the hype was about. But everyone kept saying “it’s so good,” and I kept giving it another chance.

Then one day, I realized it’s not just the drink — it’s the chewy tapioca pearls that make it so addictive. Like, I could just keep chewing those things forever. 😭 I absolutely hate popping Bobas though — the ones that burst with syrup inside? Nope, not for me. I’m a hundred percent team tapioca pearls, always.

Anyway, when I went to Thailand, I had the best Boba experiences ever. Tried two or three different kinds, and two of them completely won me over. The quantity was huge, and I loved that. I wish we had shops here that served that much. I mean, when there’s quality and quantity together, that’s a win for me.

So yeah, back home in Hyderabad, I’ve been trying out Bobas from different places. And if I ever leave this city (which I eventually will 🥲), one thing I’ll definitely miss is the Boba from Pop O Bob.

The mocha bubble tea (even though it’s actually coffee — I don’t know why they call it tea 😅) is my absolute go-to. I swear I’ve ordered it at least 20 times already. It’s one of those drinks that never disappoints. Even if they forget the pearls sometimes, I still drink it — it’s that good.

It has this distinct mocha flavor — you can taste the coffee, but there’s something else in there that I just can’t figure out. If anyone’s tried it and knows what that extra flavor is, please tell me. I want to buy that exact thing. 😂

They also give a good amount of pearls (thank god), so it feels like a good deal too. I love it. I’d genuinely recommend it to anyone, especially if you’re a coffee person like me.

Not a promotion or anything — just genuine love. But yeah, thanks to Zomato and Swiggy for making it possible for me to get my Boba fix whenever I want. ☕🧋

1oqqafr,https://v.redd.it/7vyka25c3tzf1,💀 Is Tyler Really Dying? 😱,"Okay, so it’s not really a theory, it’s actually pretty well supported by what we see in the show.

  
First off, most of the Nights’ storyline in season 2 basically revolves around one goal: “FREE WILLY....uh, FRANÇOISE from his Hyde curse of course.” 😅

And then we get that line from his mom when her son starts glorifying the Hyde within him: “Yeah yeah, that’s nice and all, but it takes a piece of your humanity every time.” (Okay, not a literal quote, but that’s basically the idea.) 

Also, the showrunners even talked about it in one of their interviews (I can’t remember which one, and honestly I didn’t have the motivation to look it up 😅).

Anyway, all that to say: even if Tyler isn’t worried about this little “side effect” right now, it’s definitely going to catch up to him sooner or later. (Season 3? Season 4?....)

And seriously, doesn’t he transform like every five seconds? (Okay, I’m exaggerating, but really: how many outfits does this guy destroy per episode? 😅) Couldn’t he at least keep a small emergency backpack or something?

So here are my questions:  
\- Is Tyler going to die… or be on the verge of dying?

\- Maybe in season 3, maybe later?

\- Will he sacrifice himself in a last attempt at redemption?

But then: 

\- Who’s going to save him? Wednesday, or the still-unknown Big Bad? (Yeah, I know, that’s one of *my* theories again… but I kinda like this one 😏) And will he even be saved? 

\- Or maybe he’ll come back as Wednesday’s spiritual guide (I mean, how hilarious would it be if he’s just chilling inside her head, drinking coffee with Weems? 😂). Yeah, I know, this is total nonsense… but hey, you gotta laugh a little sometimes, right? 😉

\- Or maybe… his own spinoff?  


So what do you guys think?

1oqqa08,https://i.redd.it/qzvhebv34tzf1.png,F*CK YEAH I PASSED,"Took my test first thing in the morning. Had a coffee and banana before driving off with my instructor who was absolutely brilliant (shoutout Steve!)

Bit of background on me, I never really had a significant driving experience. My only experience was having a couple of manual lessons back home in the Philippines more than 10 years(!!) ago, and I never really got a full license after having manual lessons since I didn't see the point of having a license with no car lol

I passed my theory on April, booked my practical for November, then I started having automatic driving lessons here in the UK last July, and have had a total of 20 hours ish of driving lessons. I found a really good driving instructor in Steve (who was really close with the band Iron Maiden, so that's really cool) and he quickly put me into shape.

My last few lessons before the test was horrendous. I keep on messing up on the big roundabouts, and had a few dangerous faults as well. It got to a point where I was advised to maybe cancel my test, and have it rebooked, but given the current situation with the booking, I pleaded to push through with it. I locked in on my last two lessons, and made sure I am on tip top condition. My instructor also gave me printed tips on how to deal with the roundabouts I keep having problems with, and he made sure that I know how to deal with them.

I cannot emphasize how important having a good instructor can be. Mine was cool and collected, but also does not hold back when I make mistakes which I appreciate. And he is also more nervous than I am on the day of the exam, which I found comforting knowing that someone is more nervous than me lol

My two minors are avoidable. The first one being not fully looking on the right in a roundabout, but I knew that it was safe to go ahead. The examiner was nice about it and he did say that he noticed me paying attention to my peripheral vision, but did emphasize the need to look at the right before going.

My second minor was, well, I blame it on my nerves lol. I was on a country road with a 60 mph limit, but I was being careful and nervous about going faster because of the narrow road and fast cars that are coming in front of me.

But fuck it, I passed! I can finally get serious whenever looking for cars in AutoTrader and not just day dream about it. Also a huge thanks for this sub for the tips (such as the banana lol) and calming my nerves as well.

Here's what's working best for me right now.

*   GitHub Copilot. Still my go to for real time coding suggestions and boilerplate generation. Makes repetitive tasks much faster.
    
*   MGX. It's not just an assistant, it's like having a small AI dev team that can plan, architect, and build projects end to end. My favorite feature is Race Mode, where it spins up multiple “candidate builds” in parallel. It’s like having several devs racing to write the cleanest, most stable code. Saved me hours debugging. I used it recently to prototype an API and dashboard combo.
    
*   Zed. My new favorite lightweight editor. Super responsive, integrates well with Claude, and just feels focused.
    
*   Claude Code GitHub Action. An underrated gem. Runs AI based pull request reviews before merging. Helps catch structure or logic issues early.
    
*   GitHub Desktop. Keeps my AI generated commits organized when working across multiple branches and experiments.
    
*   n8n (self hosted). Not exactly AI, but pairs beautifully with everything else. I connect outputs from MGX or Copilot into automated workflows for data cleanup, notifications, or file triggers.

I've recently gotten into coding, MCP tools, and local AI — so between a local AI PC and Sonnet 4.5 for a bit of heavy lifting with code — I've not needed ChatGPT anymore, as my local AI already has a lot of the functionality I need. So I figured — let's download my data to archive it (and maybe even load it into a local AI memory database 🤷) and move on.

OpenAI have just been... strange about this? Firstly — I make the request, it's taking a while so I email them to check in. Standard response ""yeah just working on it will escalate the request and get back to you"" kind of thing.

I decide to be cheeky and throw in a little ""while I have you, can I also have all of the CoT tokens that are obscured from the user? Australian privacy policy seems to imply I have a right to see them."" (actually i wrote it like an armchair lawyer squinting at 471 pages of a 1988 legal document but that was the jist) and obviously I receive ZERO response to my check-in emails after that - i get the data **EXACTLY** 30 days later. (i think it includes the data anyway just not plainly - i'll have to set a code-bot loose in a virtual environment with the export to find out)

But in looking at the chat.html file... Brother this was exported by some poor OpenAI intern with a third party Chrome addon 2 days ago... 

Looking at my data export from August, the chat.html was structured differently — i've yet to look through my conversations.json file (it's 400mb of text in a single line lol) but im curious if that is majorly different too 🤔

As the title says, I dislike being perceived. I'm not exactly scared of it, I don't worry that anything bad will happen or have social anxiety, I just really really hate it. I've been having meltdowns every day after work because the mental toll that being perceived is taking on me is too much to handle. Being around people for 8 hours a day is almost impossible for me right now and I don't know how to fix it. 

I just really struggle with the idea that people can form ideas and perceptions of me that don't align with how I see myself if that makes sense? So it makes sitting in an office incredibly difficult because I am hyper aware of how everything I do might be perceived in another person's head. I don't like to move too much in case I make noise, won't get coffee because I don't want to disrupt other people's work, struggle to ask for help when I need it because I don't want to be seen as someone lacking in common sense or unable to take initiative. If I sit in the cafe at lunch and someone sits near me I'm then completely unable to relax because all of my mental energy is going towards monitoring them, what they are doing, and how what I'm doing might impact them, the same when sitting in the office.

I haven't explained it fully because I don't want this post to be thousands of words long but that's the general gist of it.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations—the ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

After using my Campinggaz Bleuet Compact for a while I'm looking to upgrade to a cooking system

tl;dr:  
\- Canister stove  
\- Possibility to cook different meals  
\- Flame / simmer control  
\- Max weight \~500 grams  
\- Europe based  
\- Spring / summer use

MSR Switch, Jetboil MiniMo or other suggestion?

Long version:

After a long time using the Campinggaz Bleuet Compact happily I'm looking to upgade, however I'm not that familiar with all the options and a little bit overwhelmed. I want to move away from the propierty connection of campinggaz. And my search started when I came across the MSR Switch, I love the integrated pot, but that you can also use the small arms for other pots and pans.   
My main use is backpacking trips of only 2-3 days during spring / summer and to be honest mostly on festival campings. To make coffee in the morning, but also to be able to make scrambelled eggs or pancakes.   
Looking more deeply into MSR, the reactor or whisperlite seem to be complete overkill for me and just the pocketrocket is hardly an upgrade from what I already have.  
Then I also looked into Jetboil. I don't want a one trick pony that only boils water. it took me a while to figure out, but apprantly most Jetboils don't have a way to control the flame / heat, so that leaves me with the MiniMo. That one also comes with a pot support which is nice. Besides the shapes of the pots I don't see much difference between the Jetboil Minimo and the MSR Switch, the only really noticable thing is that the Jetboil locks to the pot while the MSR just sits on the stove. Is that a big deal? When / why did you have to move your pot / how did it help?   
This is my first time looking into this and I watched a lot of reviews, so perhaps I'm missing some points, please let me know! And thank you for taking the time to respond :)",1,1762507640.0,Backpackingstoves,1,1.0,False

1oqpwb7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqpwb7,"CCL Products India: From Quiet Compounder to Breakout Star – How Capacity Expansion, Product Premiumization, and Strategic Debt Management Powered a 263% Multiyear Rally","# CCL Products India Limited: A Case Study of Four Historic Breakouts

# Company Overview

CCL Products [](https://www.perplexity.ai/finance/CCL.BO) is India's largest exporter of instant coffee and a leading private label coffee manufacturer globally. Established in 1994 (initially as Continental Coffee Limited), the company has evolved into a major player in the global coffee processing industry with a presence in over 110 countries.​

The company operates as a specialized **B2B coffee processor** for global brands and private label clients, with approximately **90% of revenue derived from export contracts**. Major clients include leading international retailers and FMCG companies across Europe, North America, and Asia. The business model is characterized by cost-plus pricing arrangements where raw material costs pass through to clients, shielding CCL from direct commodity price exposure on most contracts.​

CCL Products operates manufacturing facilities strategically located in two major coffee-growing regions: **India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) and Vietnam, plus a granulation facility in Switzerland.** The company specializes in multiple instant coffee variants including spray-dried, freeze-dried, and agglomerated coffee, with combined capacity exceeding 76,000-77,000 metric tonnes annually as of FY25.​

# Breakout 1: March 2021 (~₹283) - Capacity Expansion Foundation

**Market Context & Triggers:**  
In March 2021, CCL was positioned at approximately ₹283, setting the baseline for an extraordinary 263% rally. The triggers for this first breakout were beginning to form:

* **Vietnam Facility Expansion**: The company had commissioned 3,500 MT of additional capacity at its Vietnam plant, with full commercialization expected by Q2-Q3 FY22. This brownfield expansion nearly doubled Vietnam's capacity from 10,000 MT to over 13,500 MT.​
* **Post-COVID Recovery**: After pandemic disruptions in FY20, the export markets were stabilizing with renewed demand.
* **Freeze-Dried Coffee Ramp-up**: The high-margin Sullurpet facility (5,000 MT freeze-dried capacity) was ramping up production, offering better realisations than spray-dried variants.​
* **Capacity Utilization Improvement**: Vietnam facility was reaching 95% utilization while India facilities operated at 60-65%, indicating headroom for margin expansion.​

**Fundamental Story:**  
The fundamental narrative was compelling but largely unappreciated: **capacity + margin mix**. While revenue growth appeared modest, the strategic shift toward freeze-dried coffee (which commands 25-30% price premiums) was beginning. The company had sold out its entire FY22 capacity and was booking orders ahead.​

# Breakout 2: June 2022 (~₹350-400) - Vietnam Capacity Realization

**Key Developments & Catalysts:**  
Between March 2021 and June 2022, the stock moved from ₹283 to ₹375-400 area—a 32-41% move. This breakout was driven by:

* **Commercial Production Commencement**: The 3,500 MT Vietnam expansion commenced commercial production in Q1-Q2 FY22, immediately contributing to revenues.​
* **Gross Margin Expansion**: Gross margins expanded significantly to 52.7% on account of higher realizations and increased freeze-dried coffee volumes, which typically offer 25-30% better pricing.​
* **Order Book Strength**: Full capacity utilization meant the company had secured contracts covering the expanded capacity, providing revenue visibility.​
* **Coffee Price Cycle**: The mid-2021 to mid-2022 period saw moderate coffee bean prices, allowing CCL to balance cost-plus margins without demand destruction.

**What Traders Missed:**  
Most analysts were focused on topline revenue in absolute rupee terms. However, **the real story was margin quality**: freeze-dried coffee as a percentage of the product mix was increasing, and the cost-plus model meant these higher-margin products didn't compress profitability even as volumes grew.

# Breakout 3: April 2025 (~₹550-600) - Q4 FY25 Earnings Surprise

This was a consolidation-to-breakout phase lasting nearly 3 years (June 2022 to April 2025) before the next major leg. **What fundamentally changed in FY24-25?**

**Critical Catalysts:**

1. **Vietnam Capacity Doubling Completion**: By FY24, the second phase of Vietnam expansion (adding 13,500 MT across spray-dried and freeze-dried lines) neared completion, taking total Vietnam capacity to \~26,500 MT.​
2. **Margin Pressure & Working Capital Nightmare (FY23)**: The spike in coffee bean prices during FY22-23 created a severe working capital crunch. Coffee prices surged globally, forcing CCL to finance expensive inventory. This temporarily compressed profitability. However, this was a temporary pain—**the inflection point came when prices started moderating**.​
3. **Q4 FY25 Earnings Explosion** (announced May 2025):
   * Net profit: ₹101.9 crore (+56% YoY from ₹65.2 crore)
   * Revenue: ₹836 crore (+15% YoY from ₹726.7 crore)
   * EBITDA: ₹163.3 crore (+38% YoY from ₹118.1 crore)
   * EBITDA Margin: Expanded to 19.5% from 16.3%​
4. **Working Capital Unwinding**: As green coffee prices declined 20-30% from peak levels, inventory financing requirements eased dramatically. The company could redeploy this capital or reduce debt.​
5. **Domestic Branded Business Traction**: By FY24, the domestic branded revenue segment reached ₹2,100 Mn (\~8% of total revenue), demonstrating a successful new growth vector beyond B2B exports.​

**The Trigger:**  
The April-May 2025 breakout (\~₹550 to ₹600+) followed announcement of Q4 FY25 results on May 5, 2025, with the stock surging 17% to ₹694.95 on May 6.​

# Breakout 4: November 2025 (~₹1,026) - Q2 FY26 Accelerated Growth

**Current Drivers (Most Recent Breakout):**

The most recent and most powerful leg came with Q2 FY26 results (quarter ending September 2025), announced in early November:

**Record-Breaking Performance:**​

* **Revenue**: ₹1,126.73 crore (52.6% YoY growth) — **First time crossing ₹1,000 crore quarterly revenue**
* **Net Profit**: ₹100.86 crore (+29.6% YoY from ₹77.7 crore in 9MFY25 average)
* **PBDIT**: ₹197.13 crore
* **Operating profit-to-interest ratio**: 6.04x (strong debt servicing capability)

**What Changed Fundamentally:**

1. **Debt Reduction Achieved**: Net debt declined to ₹16.7 billion in Q1 FY26 (vs ₹19.7 billion in Q3 FY25). The company is on track to reduce debt to ₹12 billion by March 2026.​
2. **Interest Cost Management**: Despite rising interest expenses to ₹100.57 crore (28% growth), the interest coverage remains healthy at 6x, and management guided that interest cost will taper from Q3 FY26 onwards as depreciation stabilizes and debt reduces.​
3. **Capacity Utilization & New Orders**: Capacity utilization is at 60% across facilities, but the company has guided 10-20% volume growth and 15-20% EBITDA growth for FY26. Management commentary indicated strong order inquiries for the expanded capacity.​
4. **Premium Product Mix Shift**: By Q2 FY26, freeze-dried coffee capacity additions (6,000 MT in Vietnam by end FY25) were coming online, further shifting the mix toward higher-margin products.​
5. **Domestic Branded Revenue Acceleration**: Domestic branded coffee revenue grew \~50% YoY in 9MFY25, with the company targeting ₹300+ crore of branded sales in FY25 (up from \~₹200 crore prior year).​
6. **Green Coffee Price Tailwind**: With global coffee prices down 30% from recent peaks, client demand is picking up without margin compression due to the cost-plus model.​

# Key Factors Present Just Before Each Breakout

Understanding the **pre-breakout setup** is critical for identifying similar opportunities:

|Factor|Pre-2021|Pre-June 2022|Pre-April 2025|Pre-Nov 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Capacity Growth**|Vietnam expansion announced|Expansion commissioned|Vietnam doubling near completion|Additional freeze-dried lines online|
|**Margin Profile**|Shift to freeze-dried planned|Freeze-dried ramp-up|Recovery after working capital squeeze|Expanding mix toward premium|
|**Order Book**|Building|Full capacity sold|Multi-year contracts signed|Strong inquiries reported|
|**Debt Situation**|Moderate|Manageable|Peak working capital debt|Debt reduction trajectory visible|
|**Coffee Price Cycle**|Moderate|Moderating|Bottoming after spike|Post-peak stabilization|

|**Earnings Visibility**|Limited (capacity not yet online)|Improving (capacity online)|Constrained (WC pressure)|Excellent (debt easing + growth)|

# The Learning Lesson: From ₹283 to ₹1,026 (263% Return)

# 1. Capacity + Mix Multiplication

CCL's journey exemplifies how **capacity expansion combined with product mix premiumization** creates multi-year compounding:

* Started with 35,000 MT capacity in FY21
* Added 3,500 MT Vietnam (FY22), then 13,500 MT more Vietnam + freeze-dried lines in India
* By FY25, capacity reached 76,000-77,000 MT with freeze-dried share increasing from \~15% to 20%+
* This compounds: *More capacity × Better mix = Exponential earnings acceleration*

# 2. The Working Capital Cycle is a Hidden Profit Factory

The FY22-23 crisis (coffee prices spiking) looked like a disaster. However:

* Companies with cost-plus contracts survive commodity spikes
* When prices cool, **working capital unwinds create a one-time profit boost**
* CCL freed up ₹2-3+ billion in working capital as prices fell 30%, enabling debt reduction and profit growth simultaneously

# 3. Debt Trajectory Matters More Than Current Levels

* In 2021-22, CCL had moderate debt but was investing in capacity
* By FY24, debt peaked due to working capital but was clearly **managed and trending down**
* By Q1-Q2 FY26, debt trajectory was so compelling that the market re-rated the stock
* Lesson: **Declining debt + growing earnings = re-rating catalyst**

# 4. Export Concentration with Diversification

While 90%+ revenue came from exports, CCL diversified:

* **B2B**: Premium coffee for global brands (sticky, long-term contracts)
* **B2C Domestic**: Branded coffee (50% growth trajectory, targeted to ₹300+ crore by FY26)
* **Premium Segments**: Freeze-dried and specialty blends for higher realisations

# 5. The Cost-Plus Model Provides Pricing Power

Most commodity processors get crushed by price spikes. CCL's cost-plus contracts mean:

* Client bears raw material risk
* CCL earns steady conversion margin (\~15-20% historically)
* When input costs ease, conversion margins actually expand due to operational leverage

# 6. Order Book Visibility as an Early Signal

Each breakout was preceded by **transparent order book signaling**:

* ""We have sold all capacity for FY22"" (2021-22)
* ""We are now booking orders for FY23"" (2022-23)
* ""Strong inquiries for new capacity"" (2025)

Traders who tracked quarterly conference call commentary had 6-12 month lead time on breakouts.

# 7. Valuation Expansion Within Reason

* March 2021: \~₹283, estimated \~6-8x EV/EBITDA (small cap, unnoticed)
* June 2022: \~₹375, \~12-14x EV/EBITDA (story emerging)
* April 2025: \~₹600, \~20x EV/EBITDA (high P/E, but justified by capacity + debt trajectory)
* November 2025: \~₹1,026, \~16x EV/EBITDA (compression due to earnings acceleration)

The final breakout was accompanied by **valuation compression** because earnings grew faster than stock price.

# Strategic Framework for Identifying CCL-Like Breakouts

**Watch for:**

1. **Capex Cycle Inflection**: Mid-cycle capacity investments that show order book visibility within 12-18 months
2. **Mix Margin Improvement**: Subtle shifts toward higher-margin products (like freeze-dried vs. spray-dried)
3. **Working Capital Efficiency**: Companies managing commodity cycles through smart pricing and debt management
4. **Debt Trajectory Clarity**: Clear visibility of debt reduction post-capex, not just absolute debt levels
5. **Export Concentration + Domestic Diversification**: Safety valve through new revenue streams
6. **Cost-Plus or Hedged Pricing**: Protection against commodity price volatility
7. **Management Commentary Shifts**: From ""managing capacity constraints"" to ""exploring new markets"" is a yellow flag

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

* Continuous margin compression despite volume growth
* Rising debt without clear capex payoff timeline
* Deteriorating order book visibility
* Loss of market share to competitors in key regions (CIS, Europe)
* Inability to pass through input cost increases to clients

# Current Position (November 2025)

At ₹1,026, CCL Products trades at:

* **P/E**: \~41.7x (based on TTM earnings of ₹338 crore)​
* **EV/EBITDA**: \~16.19x (expanded EBITDA base)​
* **Debt/Equity**: 0.73-0.93x (manageable, declining)​
* **ROE**: 8.2% (modest but improving as debt reduces)​
* **Revenue Growth**: 17% (TTM)​

**Investment Thesis for Next 2-3 Years:**

* Volume growth of 10-20% (guided)
* Margin expansion from premium mix (20%+ freeze-dried by FY27)
* Debt reduction to ₹12 billion by March 2026, then to ₹8 billion by FY27
* Domestic branded business scaling to ₹500+ crore (from ₹250 crore)
* Interest cost stabilization as debt and depreciation decline

**Fair Value Estimate**: ₹858-900 (50% margin discount for risks), implying limited near-term upside but strong 2-3 year compounding potential if execution continues.​

# Summary: The Teaching Points

The ₹283 to ₹1,026 journey teaches that **multi-bagger returns come from:**

1. **Capacity multiplication** matched with **product mix premiumization**
2. **Working capital cycles** that free cash for shareholders after commodity troughs
3. **Declining debt trajectory** that compound earnings growth through lower interest costs
4. **Pricing power** protected through cost-plus contracts and client stickiness

If you want a guy who lifts, reads, cooks, and keeps plans - hi.

A bit about me

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in Germany. I’m 198 cm tall, in good shape, and I’d say I’m kinda cute? (I’ll gladly send selfies so you can be the judge of that yourself early on.) I have clean pale skin, short black/dark-brown hair, and brown eyes.

What I’m into

Books, working out, cooking, co-op games (love co-op horror if that's your vibe), shows (anything from Gravity Falls to Chernobyl), martial arts newbie (getting less foldable). I also love fragrances and taking care of myself.

Vibe

Calm in public, affectionate and playful in private: I show love through food, touch, words and thoughtful gifts.
Most nights I'm social or training, but I protect time for my person.

Looking for

Monogamy, adult communication, equal effort and consistency: When we like each other, we act like it. Spontaneity is welcome (booked my Seoul trip three days before flying).

Travel + everyday

I'll travel Lapland + Japan/Taipei next year - ideally with the right person over time. Day-to-day I’m a homebody: picture steady and cozy weekdays and new experiences during weekends and holidays.

Filters (read before DM)

I am fine with LDR as long as we click and are on the samw page when it comes to the logistics, but I prefer NRW (or close)/Belgium/Netherlands and only around my age (anywhere from 18 to 25), so if we click, meeting stays easy.
If this fits, message with age + city and tell me what kind of date we'll be doing once I'm back: coffee, museum or one of your suggestions.",1,1762507353.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Most people with these procedures seem to look normal, rather than like the older celebrities who can't move their face.

For comparison with something more visible, is it as common as vaping?

Is there a big overlap between those with voluntary unhealthy lifestyles (vaping, high alcohol consumption, drugs, cigarettes or  processed food) and these treatments? People who want to look healthy but also partake in fashionable hobbies like vaping that are bad for their body.

Your home office isn't just a sterile room with a desk and a chair anymore. It's where you answer emails while sipping your morning coffee, eat a quick lunch between Zoom calls, and where your furry ""coworker"" decides to nap after tracking in a bit of mud. It's a lived-in, multi-functional space.

And that's amazing! But it also means one thing: your office floor takes a beating.

If you've ever cringed at the thought of a coffee spill on your beautiful rug or spent an afternoon trying to vacuum ground-up crackers from the fibers, you know the struggle. Traditional rugs are a nightmare to clean. Professional cleaning is expensive, and spot-treating rarely gets the job done right.

This is where the humble, yet utterly revolutionary, **home office machine washable rug** comes in. It's not just a floor covering; it's a strategic tool for a cleaner, healthier, and more productive workspace.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

## The Unbeatable Benefits: More Than Just ""Easy Clean""

Switching to a washable rug for your office isn't just about convenience—it's a complete upgrade to your work-from-home life.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### *Effortless Cleanup, Zero Anxiety*

Spilled your latte? Dropped a pen? The kids walked through with sticky fingers? Instead of panicking, you just deal with it. Most messes can be spot-treated, but for the big stuff, you simply roll it up, toss it in the washing machine, and forget about it. This peace of mind is priceless and lets you focus on your work, not on potential disasters.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### *A Healthier Workspace for Better Focus*

Rugs are magnets for dust, dander, pollen, and other allergens. Over time, this buildup can affect air quality and even impact your concentration and health. Being able to wash your rug every few months means you're regularly removing these irritants, creating a cleaner, fresher environment for you to breathe in. Think of it as a reset button for your office air.

### *Style Without Sacrifice*

Remember the old, flimsy rubber-backed mats of the past? Forget them. Today's machine washable rugs are incredibly stylish. They come in a huge variety of patterns, textures, and colors to match any aesthetic—from minimalist and Scandinavian to bold and bohemian. You can have a gorgeous, high-end look without the high-maintenance headache.

### *The Ultimate Pet-Friendly Flooring Solution*

For those of us with pets, a washable rug isn't a luxury; it's a necessity. It handles everything from muddy paws and shedding fur to the occasional accident. Instead of constantly spraying deodorizer or resigning yourself to a ""well-loved"" (i.e., stained) rug, you can keep it looking and smelling fresh with a simple wash.

## What to Look For When Buying Your Washable Office Rug

Ready to take the plunge? Great! But not all washable rugs are created equal, especially for a high-traffic area like a home office. Here’s what to keep in mind.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### *Material and Pile Height Matter*

For an office setting, you'll want to look for a **low-pile rug**. This means the fibers are short and tight.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

*   **Why low-pile?** Your office chair's wheels will glide smoothly over it without getting caught or pulling the fibers.
*   **Best Materials:** Look for rugs made from durable, synthetic materials like **polypropylene or polyester blends**, or soft, absorbent cotton and chenille. These are designed to hold up to repeated washing without losing their shape or color.

### *Size, Shape, and Placement*

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Don't just guess—measure! A rug that's too small can make a space feel disjointed, while one that's too big can overwhelm it.

*   **A good rule of thumb:** Your rug should be large enough to fit the front legs of your desk and chair. This helps to visually ""anchor"" your workspace and define it from the rest of the room.
*   **Runners** are excellent for narrow spaces or for creating a clear pathway.
*   **Rectangles** are the most common and versatile.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### *Non-Slip Backing is a Must-Have*

Safety first! A rug that bunches up or slides around is a tripping hazard. Many modern washable rugs come with a durable, non-slip rubber or latex backing. If your chosen rug doesn't have one, **invest in a high-quality rug pad**. A pad also adds extra cushioning, which is a nice touch for comfort.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### *Always Read the Washing Instructions!*

This is the most important step. Before you buy, check the care label. Most are designed for home washing machines and recommend:
*   **Cold water**
*   **Gentle cycle**
*   **Mild detergent**
*   **Tumble dry on low heat or, even better, air dry**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Air drying is gentler on the fibers and will extend the life of your rug. Knowing this upfront prevents any surprises on laundry day.

## Pro-Tips for Maintaining Your New Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Once you have your perfect rug, keep it looking its best with these simple tips:

*   **Shake it out weekly:** Give it a good shake outside to remove loose dirt and dust before it settles deep into the fibers.
*   **Spot-treat immediately:** The faster you tackle a spill, the less likely it is to set.
*   **Use a rug pad:** As mentioned, it protects both your floor and the rug. For an office chair, look for a dense felt and rubber combo pad.
*   **Don't overstuff the washer:** Give the rug plenty of room to move around for the most effective clean.
*   **Rotate it every few months:** This helps ensure even wear, especially in high-traffic zones.

## Your Workspace, Upgraded

A **home office machine washable rug** is one of the smartest investments you can make in your work-from-home setup. It solves real-world problems with a simple, elegant solution. It protects your floors, improves air quality, gives you peace of mind, and lets you express your personal style—all without breaking the bank or your back with complicated cleaning routines.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=home%20office%20machine%20washable%20rug)

You don’t need a fat wallet to experience Auroville’s peace.  
This global township — often mistaken for a luxury eco-village — is, at its heart, a community built on simplicity, sharing, and soulful living.

If you know where to look, you can spend an entire day here — **eating fresh, exploring freely, and even staying overnight** — for **under ₹1000**.  
Here’s how to experience Auroville the way locals and long-term residents do — slow, soulful, and sustainable.

# 1. Where to Stay

**Affordable Guesthouses and Dorms That Feel Like Home.**

Forget fancy villas and wellness retreats — Auroville has plenty of **budget-friendly guesthouses** that are peaceful, clean, and deeply community-driven.

Here are a few that offer beds between ₹400–₹600 per night:

* **Afsan Guest House:** Cozy dorms, shared garden space, and optional community dinners.  
* **Mitra Youth Hostel:** Basic rooms, free bicycles, and access to organic farms.  
* **Aspiration Community Guesthouse:** Ideal for long stays; visitors can join community cooking sessions and yoga mornings.  

*Tip:* Many guesthouses offer discounts if you help with gardening or cleaning for an hour a day — that’s how true Auroville spirit works.



# 2. Where to Eat

**Healthy, Local Meals That Don’t Break the Bank.**

Auroville’s food scene is fresh, global, and surprisingly affordable if you avoid the tourist cafés.  
 Here’s how to eat well under ₹300 per meal:

* **Auroville Cafeteria:** Authentic community-style meals — rice, vegetables, and salad for around ₹150.  
* **Naturellement Café:** Fresh fruit bowls and croissants under ₹200.  
*  **Ganesh Bakery:** Local-run spot near Certitude, serving dosas, omelets, and coffee under ₹100.  

*Pro Tip:* Bring your own water bottle — most cafés offer free refills and reusable cups.



# 3. Free & Mindful Things to Do in Auroville

**Because the Best Experiences Don’t Cost Anything.**

You can spend the entire day discovering Auroville without spending a rupee.  
Here are must-do experiences that cost nothing but attention:

*  **Visit the Matrimandir Viewpoint:** Entry is free — just register in advance at the Visitor Centre.  
* **Walk the Green Belt Trails:** Miles of shaded paths through farms, forests, and art studios.  
* **Attend a Community Event:** From sunset drum circles to yoga sessions — check the noticeboard at the Visitor Centre.  
*  **Explore Art Houses:** Free exhibitions and workshops at Kala Kendra and Sankalpa Art Village.  

*Bonus:* Visit on a Saturday — you might stumble upon a local farmers’ market with live music and organic food stalls.



# 4. Getting Around

**Bicycles, Scooters, and the ₹100 Ride Rule.**

Auroville is spread out, but transportation is easy and eco-friendly.

*  **Rent a Bicycle:** Around ₹100–₹150 a day from most guesthouses.  
*  **Rent a Scooter:** ₹400–₹500 per day if you want to explore further.  
*  **Walk:** Most cafés, shops, and art centers are within walking distance of the Visitor Centre.  

*Pro Tip:* Avoid autos for short trips — they charge ₹150–₹200 even for 2 km. Instead, rent early and keep it the whole day.

 You’ll leave with dusty shoes, a calm mind, and a full heart — not receipts.

When you slow down, eat simply, and stay connected to nature, ₹1000 feels like a fortune.

My business buys around 120kg of coffee per week so according to Scott Rao calculation even 5kg roaster would be sufficient but since my budget allows it seems like a better option to buy 15-30kg roaster and spend 1-2 days roasting coffee instead of 5 and use that extra time to focus on other activities like new clients, sales etc. also less cleaning and maintenance.

Are there any downsides on buying larger 15-30kg machine? I understand that it would cost more to mess up a batch but does it even happen often if I use automation and Artisan?

Do I also need a sample roaster for larger machine like this to find the profile? So far we only have 1 profile of coffee that we sell and I plan to replicate that.

Yes I am a beginner for now but have plans on both theoretical and practical knowledge before my machine arrives.

Thank you for any advice.",1,1762506031.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

1oqp3lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1oqp3lo/30_nights_in_on_20mg_long_post/,30 Nights in on 20mg (LONG POST),"Hi everyone! I’ve been on 20mg now for 30 nights (I take it at 10pm every night). I was on 10mg from September 13th until October 8th when my NP bumped me up. So it’s been one day short of a month on 20mg now. The past few weeks have been a mix of up and down & then good. 
     I have always been a hypochondriac since I was 14, and I’m now 22. I don’t think I ever felt real anxiety or panic, until September 5th this year. I just started to shake uncontrollably and felt impending doom. Then the intrusive thoughts followed, and everything crashed. I was diagnosed with GAD & Panic Disorder. 
    I was dealing with tremors due to GAD/panic disorder and intrusive thoughts but the trembling stopped a day after I started the 10mg lexapro (maybe placebo?) and over the total time that I’ve been on the medicine in general which is a little under 8 weeks counting the 10mg I took, I haven’t been as tense, I react to things differently (in a good way! No more freaking out over a spilled coffee), I sleep better (my dreams are wild, BUT they’re not bad dreams! Sometimes weird, but never bad haha.), and I’ve actually been finding myself interacting with more people (I’ve always felt like in public everyone was staring at me and judging me), and I’ve been open to trying new food & drinks which isn’t like me! 
   Most of this all kicked in though just within the past few weeks. In the early weeks of starting 10mg lexapro, I found myself thinking “life is beautiful” and “I love life”. I found joy in the smallest things. Before the nasty fall weather kicked in where I live & the time change happened, the sunshine and warmth outside made me happy! Now though, I don’t find myself saying those things to myself, and I don’t try to find appreciation for the small things, even though I do feel those things. My mind has been super quiet, and I haven’t ruminated over the things or gave attention to the things I shouldn’t. I’ve also been in therapy every Thursday, but today and the week before last week, I was just real tired and didn’t feel like going, and I’ve felt really guilty about it. 
Over the past few weeks along with all of this my energy has came & gone, and same thing with my sleep schedule & motivation. I fall asleep so easy now, compared to before the medicine when I could not sleep at night, no matter how tired, because my mind would race of things I needed to do, sometimes it would race with intrusive thoughts, etc. I just couldn’t shut it off. I would go to bed when the sun came up because it was more comforting to me. 
 Truly though, I hadn’t felt “anxiety” for a couple weeks, as it all kind of settled. I mean it would linger, and come in waves, but tonight, the anxiety has came and seem to hit me heavy and not leave. My sleep schedule finally was great for once as I’ve always been a night owl, but I could finally sleep and my brain was finally quiet, but today I woke up at 4:30pm and I downed two iced coffees both with espresso (made from home, & I think I put too much espresso), but I’m an avid coffee drinker & always have been! I’m not sure if it could be that I consumed too much espresso, too fast. but everything honestly had been quiet the past couple weeks. Everything that happened kinda just seemed like background noise but today, since 8pm the anxiety has hit me hard. 
 The past two weeks I’ve noticed myself running my fingers through my hair more & pulling at it to get the split ends out. (I have long hair and lots of split ends due to dying it over the past few years) and I swear I have broke some of it off and it has bothered me so bad. It feels so thin and it used to be really, really thick. I feel like this is a new habit that I’ve developed. I do have it straightened and have started using new product in it because I realized how unhealthy it was, so not sure if it could be helping and maybe this is why idk) but this is just an example of the little things that make me super, super paranoid. Tonight for some reason, looking at pictures of myself has bothered me, and i have no idea why. 

 Sorry for writing a book, someone please tell me what I’m experiencing is normal? It just feels like I’ve took a major dip today, even though I’m going on a month of lexapro. Everything was so good, I just don’t understand why all of a sudden :( ",1,1762504474.0,lexapro,4,1.0,False

Even if they didn't get it from that specific person- how many other people does it take to get so many others sick when they could have saved the spreading. I swear it, drives me bonkers.

like i'll spend 15 minutes editing a photo for instagram, picking the right caption, making sure everything looks good... for what? people i went to high school with who I haven't talked to in years?

But then my best friend asks me for a book recommendation and i just text her ""idk the one with the blue cover lol""

Or I'll have these whole thoughts about life and advice and observations sitting in my notes app but i never share them with anyone. not online, not with friends, just... sitting there. but I'll post a photo of my coffee to my story without thinking twice about it

I think its because the stuff that actually matters feels more vulnerable? like a photo of my coffee can't really be judged but if i share actual thoughts someone might think they're stupid

Also theres something weird about how we communicate now. Like I have deeper ""conversations"" with random people on reddit than i do with some of my irl friends because here I can just say what im actually thinking without worrying about how it'll affect our relationship or whatever

**Does anyone else do this?** spend more energy on content for strangers than on actual meaningful communication with people you care about?

idk maybe im just chronically online but it feels backwards. the stuff I share publicly is the least important stuff about my life and the things that actually matter i just... don't share

Couldn’t find the same coffee this year though. I tried Naivo’s Culture Natural Rose from their Ratnagiri Vault and it is similar, but has much higher acidity to the point that I’d describe that as a fruity coffee with a tinge of rose notes.

I live in an apartment complex with a few other tenants. We share a small common room — kind of like a lounge area with a couch, coffee table, and some shelves. I usually hang out there with my laptop or just to talk with neighbors.

Yesterday, I accidentally dropped my phone near one of the bookshelves and noticed a small hole tucked behind a plant. When I looked closer, I realized it was a tiny camera—like one of those spy cams you see online. It had a little SD card slot and a tiny blinking light that was barely noticeable.

I froze for a bit because it looked like it had been there for a while. I told one of my neighbors and we checked the timestamp on the files—it had months worth of footage. It literally recorded us hanging out, changing clothes sometimes when we thought we were alone, and even private convos.

I haven’t touched anything else because I’m scared I might mess up evidence or something. I’m not sure if I should go straight to the police, tell the landlord, or contact the building management first. What if the landlord is involved? Or what if someone else in the building did it?

Right now I just feel violated and sick thinking about it. I’m staying with a friend tonight because I can’t even walk back in there without panicking.

Has anyone gone through something like this? What’s the smartest first move to protect myself legally and emotionally? I don’t want this to get brushed off or mishandled.",1,1762503593.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1oqour9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discussion/comments/1oqour9/how_the_world_lost_its_habit_of_questioning/,How the World Lost Its Habit of Questioning:,"I know this article will invite a lot of online hatred and criticism, but I'm ready for it --- because someone has to speak the truth, someone has to wake up the dead. Today, you'll realize how dumb we have become, how we've been fooled for years by so many people. India is a deeply religious country, which makes it easy to manipulate people and exploit their faith for profit. When religion, faith, and belief come into play, people stop questioning --- and that's why it has been happening for years, and will continue to happen for years to come, unless we start asking questions.



If you look back at the history of our country, you'll see chaos everywhere. The Mughals ruled us for centuries, and then came the British, who looted and exploited us because they realized how easy it was to manipulate our people. We didn't question them, and that made it easier for them to oppress us. Sadly, the same thing still happens today --- when the oppressor is powerful, we stay silent and accept the oppression. You can find countless videos online where someone records an incident of injustice or wrongdoing. There's nothing wrong with making a video --- it can serve as proof of what happened --- but remember, you must also have the courage to stand up for yourself.



This isn't just India's story --- it's the story of a world that has forgotten how to ask questions. We no longer question our governments, our religious leaders, our teachers, or even our parents. That silence has become our biggest weakness. We blindly follow them in the name of faith, even when what we're doing is nonsense or completely illogical. Our governments fail us, yet we keep quiet. We've become too comfortable --- too afraid to step out of our comfort zones. I believe we Indians, especially, have accepted this silence as a way of life. We know that questioning means going against the entire society or system, and deep down we think, ""What can one person do anyway?"" --- and that's exactly where the problem begins.



There's a very famous story about Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, who was sentenced to death by his own people and government for asking too many questions. He questioned their beliefs, their faith, and their system --- and for that, they accused him of corrupting the youth and disrespecting the gods. His punishment was to drink a cup of poison hemlock. But instead of resisting, Socrates accepted it calmly. He drank the poison with a smile, as if mocking those who chose to live in ignorance and darkness, showing that truth and wisdom are worth more than life itself.



The same thing is happening in this country today. Many modern-day Socrates have died here --- reporters, activists, and thinkers who dared to question, who tried to open people's minds and bring light to the darkness. They were silenced, erased, forgotten. If you search the internet, you'll find a long list of such names --- and sadly, that list never ends.



This society has become a land of the living dead. People have accepted their chains and made peace with them. We let ourselves be ruled by gods, by governments, by priests and clerics --- but never by our own will. We are bound by invisible chains, and the worst part is that we don't even want to break them. Only a rare few dare to shatter those chains and live freely, as they truly want to --- the rest just exist, as lifeless followers in a living graveyard of society.



The moment you start questioning society, it turns against you. They try to silence you with fear, attack you with anger, and isolate you through ignorance --- because your questions threaten their comfort. But when you stand tall and calmly show that you see beyond their blind beliefs, when you seek answers that are logical and rational, that's when they begin to fear your presence. That's the moment they tell society that you're a threat --- a danger to their gods, their systems, and their illusions. And so, they boycott you.



In the end, I have only one message --- never stop asking questions. Let your curiosity breathe; let it lead you. Search for answers on your own, and you'll begin to see the world through new eyes. Life is beautiful, but when you question and seek truth for yourself, it becomes something far greater --- it becomes an awakening.

I wanted to make my own post as a lot of the recommendations are asked by people familiar with the city so here goes:

I’m traveling to Chicago today (technically) from small town Kentucky with less than 24 hours notice. Might be a bad idea, who knows. It’s been #1 on my US bucket list since I was a kid and the stars kind of aligned perfectly so here I come. I’m traveling with my mom who is attending a work conference Friday-Monday morning. We are staying at the Hyatt Regency (I think people say on the loop?) and will be solo exploring through the weekend! The weather looks bad but that’s okay lol. 

I have a whole list of things I want to do and a lot of restaurants I want to try but I think I researched too much and I’ve overwhelmed myself lol. I would love to find the following cuisines/treats/meals so if you all have recommendations around downtown, I would appreciate you so much! This will be my first time solo exploring and the biggest city I’ve ever visited (I know that’s embarrassing to say as a 33 year old mother lol) bc like I said, small town Kentucky lol. 

-Italian. Good authentic Italian 

-coffee and pastries (cinnamon rolls, donuts, muffins, etc)

-obviously Italian beef sandwiches

-any place with treats, snacks, hidden gems

-not too interested in deep dish but I do love pizza (I’m more of a NY style I’m sorrrrry)

-just your general favorite places to eat in the area!

Thank you guys, this sub is so cool, I absolutely adore the way you all connect through food. I can’t wait to go to museums and find book shops and learn history!!",3,1762503415.0,chicagofood,1,1.0,False
