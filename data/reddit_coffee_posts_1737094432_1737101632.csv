1i3bn6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i3bn6c/struggling_to_dial_in_shot_is_bitter_with_weak/,Struggling to dial in. Shot is bitter with weak crema [Sunbeam Cafe Crema],"Hi everyone!

A bit of a story of how I got my setup before we start: I was randomly scrolling FB marketplace one day when I came across someone selling a Sunbeam Cafe Crema (EM4820) for $10. I've always liked coffee and wanted to have cheap access to cafe quality coffee at home so I went ahead and purchased the machine on an impulse. They also gave me a bag of preground coffee which worked really well with the machine. Good crema and good shot that was just a little bitter. 

I made the mistake of deciding to go down the rabbit hole further and saw posts talking about how preground coffee is trash. Driven by the desire to improve my cup, I went ahead and bought some ""Grinders Coffee Roasters Crema"" medium roast beans. Then I realised I needed a burr grinder after producing literal poison when trying to use my blade grinder at home. So I once more find a good deal for $30 and get myself the Kogan Multigrinder Pro (KAMTGRNDPRB). 

That's the story of how I came across my setup and the point of it is to show that I can't really afford those fancy and expensive machines. I'm just after a decent cappucino. 

Now onto my dialing in process.

Turns out another mistake I made was not realising that the machine I was purchasing only came with a pressurised portafilter. The finer grinding settings on my grinder completely choked up the machine and I had to push the dial up to 12 (out of 15) to get a shot flowing. From there I tried a 9 grind setting and it also choked my machine.

On the third try I was able to meet the following shot variables: 17g in, 36g out in 25-30sec with a grind setting of 11

My puck prep is pretty consistent, I just grind my beans in the machine, use a spoon to mix and move the grounds to my portafilter and then tamp it down as hard as I can. I also heat up my portafilter beforehand.

Even after supposedly achieving the 'ideal' variables my shot still tastes terrible. It's strong and super bitter (with some sourness as well) and even with milk its barely drinkable. I'm a big lover of strong coffee and don't add any sugar to my drinks so I'm used to some bitterness but this was something else. 

It's bad to the point that the stale preground shot tastes much better even though it flows very fast.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to improve my shot. Please suggest things I can do with my current setup. If you can't already tell from my exposition at the start, I'm really in no position to afford expensive equipment or accessories as a broke college student. ",1,1737101339.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We live in Hoodi, Whitefield (probably most of you here don't know this area), we decided to go to Vidyarthi Bhavan yesterday evening as it was wfh for both of us, we took metro, got down at national college and walked to Vidyarthi Bhavan.

We reached Vidyarthi Bhavan around 7:50, they were already closing but we got in around 8:05 because we went there before closing with few of the other remaining people. Vidyarthi Bhavan has a shared table system so we were made to sit in front of an old man who was probably in his late 60's now, he was already there before us.

We ordered Dosa, but alas! It wasn't available anymore, the guy said only coffee and vada are available as it's already late, I expressed  disappointment with the sad tone like ""we came till here from Whitefield, don't know if we'll be able to ever come here again"".

The uncle who sat in front of us maybe overheard this, he had ordered Dosa before us , as soon as his Dosa came, he pushed the plate towards us and asked us to eat. We were like it's okay, but he convinced us a lot to eat that, he said - ""I live nearby, I've been coming here since 30 years, I am a Basavanagudi boy, I can come here again anytime, but you guys look new here, enjoy the Dosa"" - he could speak fluent English. (He literally said he is a ""Basavanagudi boy"")

Later we got into the conversation and discussed many things, he was very friendly. In the conversation flow and in the brisk of enjoying Dosa, I did not realise that the man also paid the Dosa bill himself even though he didn't eat it.

What a man! I know this is a pretty small act of kindness but this is something big for me. I've heard many stories of good people in OG Bangalore but yesterday I experienced it myself. Bangalore is üòç

He said it was from ""us.' Mind you, the only reason why I got the gift card (for a deliciousrestaurant) was so he could surprise my daughter that works there for fun. 
I felt flabbergasted, embarrassed,  angry, and sad. I asked myself, ""who is this guy?""


I ended up leaving and asked if I was upset, and I told him yes, that's a very rude thing to do.  I felt like my relationship with him is a joke. 
In the beginning of the relationship it was great,-
 he would cook and invite me over for dinners, took me to a show once, and was very responsive. He acted very different then he does now. Over time, he literally just stopped doing everything.  And I would point it out, and then he will act more attentive for like a day or two, then it goes back to the same thing. 
If I didn't remind him my birthday was coming up, I'm sure he would have forgotten. 
Last year on Valentines day, my best friend got me chocolates from a local chocolate factory.  I told him directly that he can always buy me local chocolate and flowers. I told him buy doing things, like bringing me coffee,  buy me flowers sometimes, or chocolates are just simple things that help me feel loved.
 He has never done the chocolate or flowers ever (he bought me a rose bush for my birthday and said it will bloom) but I don't want a Rose bush to take care of. I kindly accepted it however and didn't mention that. He has only brought me coffee twice in our entire relationship  (I have stopped by several times at his work to bring him stuff) 
He hasn't gifted me with any jewelry,  flowers, or anything romantic,  despite me telling him I do like those things. And I'm not materialistic, I make more than him, and have often bought him dinner, groceries, gifts etc. 

We are going to Cancun in 3 days, and it's too late to cancel. I think he thinks that by doing this, it will shut me up about not being happy or feeling like we don't spend enough time together. Which we don't anyway. I have lost feelings for him, and has broken my heart bit by bit until there is nothing left. 

I even told him to please participate in the couples counseling I set up, but he can't seem to do that either. 
Also, he wasn't fully divorced when 
we starred dating. I was leary of it and thought it wasn't a good idea, but he assured me that he can put the relationship first, which he isn't doing

 
He abandons me if we go to a bar with his friends also. One time, on his birthday night,  I paid for a really fancy nice dinner. Then he wanted to go to a hole in the wall bar where he is like a local celebrity.  The whole time, he talked to others and  I felt completely left out. These are all people he used to work with.  I'm not expecting him to only pay attention to me the whole time, but he would go off talking to other people and I would be alone sitting by myself.  I tried to not cry,.and other people were actually asking me if i was okay. I don't think my boyfriend did this intentionally,  I just don't think he has the ability to  know how his actions affect me. 



His ex wife actually divorced him due to being emotionally unavailable. They were together for 26 years. 
Oh yeah, he still has 100's of photos of his ex, which he swears, (and i think) he is over.He hasn't posted a single picture of me. It's just the principle,  (it makes.me wonder why he wont?)

So yeah, I think after the gift card incident,  my heart just stopped beating for him. I know I deserve better. At this point, I feel like I am  watching the beginning of my break up stage. ",3,1737100527.0,relationships,7,1.0,False

What really got me is when he went grocery shopping (multiple times) and purposely used one of his debit cards knowing damn well that it did not have enough on it to cover the groceries just to play woe is me so people would pay for his food. This really showed his true colors. Another time he was complaining about his high phone bill and I suggested in the Facebook delivery chat another phone carrier that is much cheaper. He said they don't have that where I am, which was a flat out lie. It's nationwide and my friend has it where he was at the time. Another lie just to beg for more money...

It should give your body the nutrients required to get knocked out at a certain time to sleep. Yes, it's that boring and simple.

I've struggled with a good healthy sleeping pattern ever since I was a teenager. I remember I had insomnia for days, and when I sleep, it's usually really short and I'd wake up multiple times in-between. It was really bad. Having a good night sleep was very rare, like once every semester or so. I truly struggled a lot. But it's gone really downhill during my freshman year.

I blame this on my first year in college. I used to wake up at 6am to get ready, take a special bus to take me to uni, arrive there at 8am, then at 6pm I'd make my way to the bus station and arrive at home at around 8:30pm. Then go to sleep at 1am due to homework and assignments. I really hated it. +2 hours of commute every day and rigorous academia messed up with my biological clock for life.

Ever since that experience, I can't sleep more than 5 hours. Like if I go to sleep at 10:00pm, I'd wake up at 3am like clockwork. It was insane. Constantly fatigued, constantly irritated... you know the drill. I had a tablet of a very strong psychedelics that enabled you to sleep for 7 hours or so but you'd start seeing things while sleeping. It helped, but obviously I abused it like a junkie and that was the lowest I've ever been.

Well, that's until a few months ago. I can finally say that I found something that worked.

First of all, I used to smoke or use some type of nicotine substance. My heartbeat would stay up for an unusual amount of time, especially at night and throughout midnight. When I smoke or use nicotine pouches, it stays in the +90bpm area constantly, and it only sorta starts going down at around 2am. When I saw a cardiologist, he told me it's unusual for healthy people but completely normal for smokers, and I got concerned for my cardiovascular health so I mustered what I had of willpower left and quit smoking in October.

Now, I noticed something ever since I quit. My aim was to keep my BPM lower than 80 (so in the 78bpm area). However, when my BPM goes to those lower ranges, I automatically start feeling sleepy lol. The easiest way for me is to lie on my back during the day for 30 mins or so and my BPM goes down. Now, feeling sleepy is not the same as sleeping, I'd feel sleepy during the day but I won't fall asleep. Hope that makes sense. And this was the first key to the puzzle.

First 2 months after quitting my sleeping was rocky, but increased in quality substantially. I'm measuring it and I am getting more ERM and deep sleep for sure. However, still sleeping 5 hours at night, still not being able to continuously sleep through the day.

And then a month ago I finally switched my diet. I went from eating eggs and veggies as a small breakfast then rice and chicken then some nuts in the evening following bro diet, to a plants-based diet but not vegan because I still eat meat.

Now I skip breakfast altogether (feels more natural to me due to my OMAD upbrining) and in the morning I'd eat a banana and an apple or an orange, and at noon I'd eat 3-4 eggs with 2 whole-grain toasts on the side and 1 piece of every vegetable I can find in the supermarket, carrot, eggplants, cucumber, tomato, pepper...etc. I'd do minimal frying except for onion, mushrooms, and pepper, and just devour that meal like a caveman. This already gives a great boost in nutrients required for the body. I can't be arsed to count how much but I know it's getting the trick done.

In the evening, I'd eat 2-3 low-sugar chocolate bars (minimal processed food), and I'd also eat 2 smalls bags of nuts (almonds, sunflower seeds, snacky sausages...etc). Something fatty to stay full. And for the rest of the day, I'd just fast and only drink water, maybe eat an apple or a banana at some point. I eat a variation of this every single day.

And oh, my, god, at 11pm, every single night, I start feeling drowsy. And not just ""sleepy"" but actually dizzy, like everything becomes delayed with 1s, no matter the context, no matter the place, no matter what I do, I feel like I could lie on the bed and sleep immediately, which is ALWAYS the case. When I sleep following this diet, I started getting deep sleep not only in the first few hours of my night, but also towards the end which to me is unheard of. And now, I'm average 7 hours of sleep every night, which I can't really ask for more. I feel like a god waking up now. On a really bad night, I sleep 6 hours now, on very good nights, 8 hours, but normal days, between 6h and 50m to 7h and 20m.",2,1737100326.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1i3bei8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1i3bei8/the_beginning_of_true_alcoholism/,The beginning of true alcoholism.,"I was a daily drinker from the day I turned 21. It was really bad at one point with vodka, half gallon every 3 days or so...plus beer, but I never accepted til recently that wasn't my worst. Which is crazy. When it got really bad was when I worked at a gated community and I got given an entire pallet of beer from a canceled covid wedding. I was living in a run down rv at the time and generally depressed. I started drinking late into the night and I can't remember if it was the first night I had the pallet, but either way I started bringing beer to work. I would bring at least a 6 pack but usually more. I'm not sure if I'm telling this as a cautionary tale or just therapeutic writing. I eventually got called out by my boss and he said he's smelt beer on me for ages, I guess I was good enough at my job that he let it slide. He sent me home and I came back the next day sober. He almost didn't let me stay but against his better judgment he let me keep working. Eventually I fell back into my old ways and was sent off property hauling loads of brush. I ended up back home and grabbed a box of wine. I blacked in and out, and my boss eventually saw me almost drive into a ditch. That was it. No job. That wasn't even rock bottom. I still have my ups and downs, right now I'm pretty ok. Just had my 2nd beer in like 12 hours and I'm not feeling the insatiable need for that drunk feeling. If you read this all, my only advice if I'd have to give it, don't drink late into the night and think that next drink isn't close enough to work time to sober up...it's a slippery slope to beer substituting coffee.

i‚Äôm not a very social person. i grew up being bullied by my peers and their families for basically my entire life and never had the chance to learn how to be social in a meaningful way, thus i had no one to teach me how to make friends. i tried to combat this with trying to make friends online. no dice there, so i move on and try again. and again. and again. and again‚Ä¶ for a very long time. 

and now i feel like I‚Äôm just meant to be alone. i have no one to talk to but my sister, and even then she barely tolerates me. no one else seems very interested in talking to me when i sign up for skill classes or go to the coffee shop or library, even when i awkwardly strike up conversation first. 

so im starting to wonder if im even meant to be alive at this point, you know? i mean, i have nothing when i really look at it. i have hobbies and stuff to fill my time and distract from the longing ache for connections in my chest, but its not enough. i want hugs and fist bumps and inside jokes and all of the in between. i dont think i deserve it anymore. i‚Äôm an alien in my own mind and body.

Choosing the right one can elevate the look of your space while serving practical needs. With so many options, from sleek [modern metal coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) to cozy [rattan round coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables), finding the perfect fit requires a balance of style, size, and functionality.

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to help you select the ideal coffee table for your living room.

# 1. Define Your Living Room‚Äôs Style

Your coffee table should complement the overall design theme of your living room. Whether you prefer a contemporary aesthetic or a bohemian vibe, there‚Äôs a coffee table that matches your vision.

* **For Modern Interiors:** Opt for a modern metal coffee table. Its clean lines, metallic finishes, and minimalist design bring a touch of sophistication and industrial chic.
* **For Cozy, Natural Vibes:** A rattan round coffee table adds warmth and texture, perfectly suited for a relaxed, bohemian, or coastal-inspired space.

# 2. Consider the Shape

The shape of your coffee table plays a significant role in how it fits and functions in your living room.

* **Rectangular Coffee Tables:** Ideal for larger seating areas, they provide ample surface space for decor, drinks, and more.
* **Round Coffee Tables:** A rattan round coffee table is perfect for smaller spaces or homes with kids, as it eliminates sharp edges while adding a stylish organic element.
* **Square Coffee Tables:** Great for balancing large sectional sofas and creating symmetry.

# 3. Material Matters

The material of your coffee table not only impacts its durability but also its aesthetic appeal. Here are some popular options:

* **Metal Coffee Tables:** Sleek and durable, a modern metal coffee table works beautifully in contemporary and industrial-themed spaces. Pair it with bold decor to make a statement.
* **Rattan Coffee Tables:** Lightweight, eco-friendly, and versatile, [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables) are ideal for homes seeking a natural and laid-back vibe. For those in the UAE, [rattan furniture UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) offers a variety of stylish options to suit different tastes.
* **Glass-Topped Tables:** These tables create a sense of openness, perfect for small spaces or minimalist designs.

# 4. Think About Functionality

Your coffee table should cater to your specific needs. Think about how you plan to use it:

* **Storage:** Need space for books, remotes, or throws? Choose a table with built-in storage or open shelving.
* **Multi-Functional:** Consider coffee tables that double as ottomans or have adjustable heights for added versatility.
* **Decorative:** If your coffee table is primarily for aesthetic purposes, a rattan round coffee table can serve as a striking centerpiece, topped with books, candles, or plants.

# 5. Size and Proportions

A coffee table that‚Äôs too large or too small can disrupt the flow of your living room. Follow these tips to find the perfect size:

* **Length:** The table should be about two-thirds the length of your sofa.
* **Height:** Choose a table that‚Äôs the same height as your sofa cushions or slightly lower.
* **Spacing:** Leave 18 inches of space between the coffee table and surrounding furniture for easy movement.

# 6. Pairing with Rattan Furniture

If you‚Äôre incorporating rattan furniture into your living room, ensure that your coffee table complements it. A rattan coffee table blends seamlessly with other rattan furniture UAE pieces, creating a cohesive and inviting look. Pair it with a soft rug and neutral tones to enhance the earthy, natural aesthetic.

# 7. Experiment with Style Combinations

Mixing materials and styles can create a unique and curated look:

* Combine a modern metal coffee table with plush sofas and vibrant throw pillows for a balanced aesthetic.
* Pair a rattan round coffee table with a sleek leather sofa to mix natural textures with modern elements.

# 8. Shop Locally for Unique Finds

For residents of the UAE, exploring local options for rattan furniture UAE can lead to discovering unique and high-quality pieces. Many stores in the region offer a variety of coffee tables, from modern designs to handcrafted rattan masterpieces.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing the perfect coffee table involves more than just aesthetics‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding a piece that fits your space, complements your style, and meets your needs. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to the sleek appeal of a modern metal coffee table or the cozy charm of a rattan round coffee table, the right choice will become the centerpiece of your living room.

1i3bagh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i3bagh/my_boyfriend_of_1_year_50m_regifted_my_gift_gift/,My boyfriend of 1 year (50m) regifted my gift (Gift card)right in front of me (37f) to his daughter. ,"TL;DR After I gave him a stocking full if presents, including the gift card, he then regifts it a cou0le days later (while I'm standing there) to his daughter.  He said it was from ""us.' Mind you, the only reason why I got the gift card (for Arbys) was so he could surprise my daughter that works there for fun. 
After that, I think I realized that I cant.be in a relationship with a man that has no concept of why that's not good to do. 
In the beginning of the relationship it was great,-
 he would cook and invite me over for dinners, took me to a show once, and was very responsive.  Over time, he literally just stopped doing everything.  And I would point it out, and then he will act more attentive for like a day or two, then it goes back to the same thing. 
If I didn't remind him my birthday was coming up, I'm sure he would have forgotten. 
Last year on Valentines day, my best friend got me chocolates from a local chocolate factory.  I told him directly that he can always buy me local chocolate and flowers. I told him buy doing things, like bringing me coffee,  buy me flowers sometimes, or chocolates are just simple things that help me feel loved.
 He has never done the chocolate or flowers ever (he bought me a rose bush for my birthday and said it will bloom) but I don't want a Rose bush to take care of. I kindly accepted it however and didn't mention that. 
He hasn't gifted me with any jewelry,  flowers, or anything romantic,  despite me telling him I do like those things. And I'm not materialistic, I make more than him, and have often bought him dinner, groceries, gifts etc. 

We are going to Cancun in 3 days, and it's too late to cancel. I think he thinks that by doing this, it will shut me up about not being happy or feeling like we don't spend enough time together. Which we don't anyway. I have lost feelings for him, and has broken my heart bit by bit until there is nothing left. 

I even told him to please participate in the couples counseling I set up, but he can't seem to do that either. 
Also, he wasn't fully divorced when 
we starred dating. I was leary of it and thought it wasn't a good idea, but he assured me that he can put the relationship first, which he isn't doing
 
He abandons me if we go to a bar with his friends also. One time, on his birthday night,  I paid for a really fancy nice dinner. Then he wanted to go to a hole in the wall bar where he is like a local celebrity.  The whole time, he talked to others and  I felt completely left out. These are all people he used to work with.  I'm not expecting him to only pay attention to me the whole time, but he would go off talking to other people and I would be alone sitting by myself.  I tried to not cry,.and other people were actually asking me if i was okay. I don't think my boyfriend did this intentionally,  I just don't think he has the ability to  know how his actions affect me. 

His ex wife actually divorced him due to being emotionally unavailable. They were together for 26 years. 
Oh yeah, he still has 100's of photos of his ex, which he swears, (and i think) he is over.He hasn't posted a single picture of me. It's just the principle,  (it makes.me wonder why he wont?)

So yeah, I think after the gift card incident,  my heart just stopped beating for him. ",13,1737099703.0,relationship_advice,18,0.81,False

As part of my work as an advisor for the Requiremints team, I had the chance to review budget mug warmer pads, the kind you place on your desk to keep your drink warm.

I thought it would be helpful to share my findings and offer assistance to anyone looking for a mug warmer, whether for personal use or as a gift.

# Things to Consider Before Buying a Mug Warmer:

* **Temperature Settings**: Check if the warmer offers adjustable temperature levels to suit your preference.
* **Safety Features**: Auto shut-off is essential for avoiding overheating or accidents.
* **Design and Compatibility**: Ensure it works with your mug type (ceramic, glass, metal).
* **Ease of Use and Cleaning**: A simple operation and easy-to-clean surface are always a plus.
* **Cord Length**: Longer cords offer more placement flexibility.

# Top Budget Mug Warmers:

1. **(Best for style and simplicity)** **SEALON SLM02 Coffee Mug Warmer** ‚Äì Features three temperature settings, a durable waterproof hot plate, and auto shut-off after 4 hours. Its wood-grain finish makes it stylish and practical for any desk.
2. **(Another option)** **Lerat Coffee Mug Warmer** ‚Äì Comes with a large heating plate, three heat settings and the auto shut-off activates after 8 hours.
3. **(Low price)** **Mr. Coffee MWBLKPDQRB** ‚Äì A compact 17-watt mug warmer with a longer cord for flexible placement. It‚Äôs easy to clean and perfect for home, office, or travel use.

If you need to see more budget options, [quickly check this page](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-mug-warmers/). My work is embedded there and there is a nice filter to help you find the best options per features and budget (it also includes electric mugs options if that may suit your need)

Let me know if you have specific questions or share your experience with these or other mug warmers.

1i3b85y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1i3b85y/fp_problemssss/,FP problemssss,"I‚Äôm a 30yo female and I have a history of having FP‚Äôs since I was in elementary school. Usually my FP‚Äôs are parental figures, so teachers, friends who were emotionally mature, and supervisors/ppl I work with. 

The last few years, most of my FP‚Äôs have been at work since that‚Äôs where I spend most of my time and my job is emotionally taxing. My current FP is my partner that I work with and due to the nature of our job, we really only have each other and rarely have time to mingle with anyone else in our workplace. 

I only recently found out about the term FP, before that I just assumed I was crazy and wasn‚Äôt capable of forming healthy attachments. 

So I told my current FP about the situation, about BPD and I sent her videos and I explained to her that she‚Äôs my FP. At first things were going well and she was very helpful during times when I was splitting or just having a rough time. I have a therapist and we‚Äôre working on making my relationship with my FP into something healthy. 

The other day, I was splitting but I usually just shut down or I‚Äôll say a couple sarcastic comments but I‚Äôll mostly just go quiet and u can see that I‚Äôm angry but I don‚Äôt act on it. I‚Äôve told my FP what I need her to do in these situations and she has done those things in the past and helped me come out of a split, however this time, she chose not to help me and rather got upset with me. Although it‚Äôs not her responsibility to help me navigate the splits, I just think I deserve some grace and what I‚Äôm asking for wouldn‚Äôt have taken long at all. 

Since that day, my FP has been pulling away and she has set boundaries that I don‚Äôt understand. For example, she said she wants to be friends and colleagues but can‚Äôt support with my mental health anymore. How the fuck is that supposed to work?!?!? She‚Äôs my fucking FP!!!! I can‚Äôt just turn it off and on top of that, she‚Äôs someone I have to work with 30hrs a week and she claims that she thinks the world of me and that she adores me but then shouldn‚Äôt she be helping me make this relationship healthy. She also said some hurtful things like that she feels like she‚Äôs in an abusive relationship with my mood cycles. But I cant agree with that. I have become so aware of myself and since she‚Äôs the first FP that I have had since finding out about my Bpd and FP‚Äôs, and she‚Äôs the first FP I‚Äôve told all of this to, I have been good at keeping boundaries such as limiting contact - for example I never text her first and any time I‚Äôm tempted to msg her I just journal instead. I control what I say as much as possible, I used to get really really mean during splits with certain FP‚Äôs, but I‚Äôve never let myself get to that point with her and I make sure to just be quiet. I have made sarcastic comments under my breath, or I‚Äôve said I hate u (immediately followed by sorry I didn‚Äôt mean that it just slipped out). I‚Äôm not saying that doing these things is okayed but I‚Äôm fucking trying so hard and every day is draining as fuck. And she wants to call that an abusive relationship? She says I get ‚Äúfurious‚Äù just because I shut down and she can ‚Äúfeel the anger coming off of me‚Äù Like bitch I‚Äôll show u how fucking crazy I can be if u really wanna go there. 

It‚Äôs like u can do so many nice things and be kind 98% of the time, but then u slip up and be ‚Äúmean‚Äù once and now u can‚Äôt handle me anymore. Like bruh I spent sooooooo much money on Christmas for her cuz she recently got divorced and her kids are trash and I just wanted to make her happy. I got her a present for every day of the month and every present was meaningful and so much thought went into it and I know she loved every second of it. I buy her a coffee every day. Her bday is on new years so no one gives a shit about it, so again I spent soooooooo much money on making it special. It‚Äôs like I do all these things to ensure that the FP won‚Äôt leave me and here we fucking are once again. I hate this fucking loop im living in, I hate my lifeeeee. 

Anyway, i took work off the last 5 days cuz I couldn‚Äôt imagine having to face her again. Today was the first day I went and saw her after 5 days. My therapist told me to send her a msg basically stating that we have to keep our relationship as professional as possible from now on and that if I msg her she shouldn‚Äôt reply to me. 

She was being normal, but then every time we were alone together she would ask me how I‚Äôm doing and if I‚Äôm okay. But isn‚Äôt that the whole fucking reason she pulled away to begin with, that she doesn‚Äôt want to support my mental health? So stop fucking asking me!!!!!!!! And I just find it so hard to be near her but not be able to act the same as before. Just fuck my life yall. ",0,1737099402.0,BPD,0,0.5,False

Whether you‚Äôre hosting a party or simply want to add a touch of elegance to your home, styling your bar cart can make all the difference. From modern minimalism to bohemian charm, here are 10 stylish ideas to inspire your next bar cart makeover.

# 1. Boho-Chic with a Rattan Bar Cart

For a warm and inviting vibe, opt for a [rattan bar cart](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/bar-carts). Its natural texture and earthy tones make it the perfect addition to boho-inspired or tropical interiors. Style it with vintage glassware, potted plants, and colorful cocktail napkins for a laid-back, beachy aesthetic.

# 2. Outdoor Oasis with Rattan Serving Trolley

Take your entertaining outdoors with a [rattan serving trolley](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/serving-trolley). Pair it with matching [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) for a cohesive patio setup. Add a pitcher of lemonade, fresh fruits, and lightweight acrylic drinkware for a casual yet elegant outdoor gathering.

# 3. Monochromatic Minimalism

If your style leans toward sleek and modern, choose a neutral-toned bar cart and style it with monochromatic decor. Stick to clear glassware, metallic accents, and white or black accessories for a sophisticated, minimalist look.

# 4. Retro Glam

Channel a vintage vibe by styling your bar cart with mid-century accessories like gold-rimmed glasses, decanters, and a retro cocktail shaker. A rattan bar cart works wonderfully in this setting, blending classic design with a modern twist.

# 5. Coffee and Tea Station

Transform your bar cart into a stylish beverage station for non-alcoholic drinks. Use a rattan serving trolley to display your favorite teas, coffee makers, and an assortment of mugs. Add a small plant or two for a cozy touch.

# 6. Multi-Level Display

Maximize storage and style by using the various tiers of your bar cart effectively. Store heavier items like wine bottles on the lower level, and reserve the top for an elegant display of glassware, cocktail tools, and decorative items.

# 7. Seasonal Themes

Switch up your bar cart styling to reflect the season. For summer, go for a tropical vibe with a rattan bar cart, vibrant linens, and fruity cocktails. In winter, add festive touches like fairy lights, seasonal greenery, and spiced drinks.

# 8. Greenery and Florals

Enhance your rattan bar cart with touches of nature. Place a small bouquet of fresh flowers, trailing greenery, or even a tiny potted herb garden on your cart. The organic textures of rattan paired with lush greenery create a serene, natural look.

# 9. Artistic Display

Turn your bar cart into a mini gallery by incorporating art. Frame a small piece of artwork and lean it against the back of the cart or hang it on the wall above. Pair it with stylish books, sculptural decor, and high-end cocktail tools for a curated, gallery-inspired setup.

# 10. Dining Room Extension

Use a rattan serving trolley as an extension of your dining room. Stock it with essentials like plates, cutlery, and serving dishes, making it easy to entertain guests. The natural texture of rattan adds warmth to your dining space while keeping it functional.

**Why Choose Rattan for Your Bar Cart?**

Rattan is not only stylish but also versatile, blending seamlessly into a variety of interior styles. Whether you‚Äôre using a rattan bar cart indoors or a rattan serving trolley outdoors, its durability and timeless appeal make it an excellent choice. Additionally, it pairs beautifully with other rattan outdoor furniture, allowing you to create cohesive spaces that flow effortlessly.

**Final Thoughts**

A well-styled bar cart can be a game-changer for your living space. Whether you prefer a relaxed bohemian feel with a rattan bar cart or a sleek, modern aesthetic, there are countless ways to customize it to suit your style. Embrace the versatility of rattan and let your creativity shine as you transform this functional piece into a stunning decor element.

1i3b65j,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingWeed/comments/1i3b65j/7_days_sober_and_struggling/,7 days sober and struggling.,"Hey guys! I'm a 20 year old guy in college (On winter break now) and I made the decision to quit smoking weed 8 days ago. This is going to be a long post, so if you read it, I appreciate it a lot. 

I came across this sub the other day. I decided it was time to make a change in my own life to better myself. And let me tell you, this has been incredibly difficult, but finally, somewhat rewarding. I have been smoking regularly since I was 15, only taking a small 1 month break when I was 17 or so. I took that break because I could tell my brain was turning to mush. I could NOT go without it, but any time I smoked I felt like a spectator in my own body. Everything felt awkward, I overthought everything, and I just couldn't be a normal person. But, on 4/20 I smoked a little bit again, and I felt my habit take hold again. 

For a short while in 2023, I had a pretty good relationship with it. I only ate the occasional edible, and held back a LOT on my intake. That was, until I met a couple who I moved in with. One was straight edge, the most they did was drink coffee. Their boyfriend however, loooved weed. That became a huge problem for both of us. We went from the occasional smoke in their car, to regularly sneaking behind his partner's back to smoke weed. Long story short, I truly think this ruined my relationship with both of them. I couldn't leave my room because I would be high off my ass and too nervous about how people perceived me. Too awkward, and lost in my own mind, to do anything fun, like leave the house.

I moved out from their place, and into a bit of a dump with 4 other stoner roommates. It felt like I could finally be ""myself"" and smoke as much weed as I wanted without judgement. Unfortunately, that just led me to fall down the horrible pit of smoking away all my free time like I did in my teens. My only boundary was that I didn't smoke before work because I work in customer service, and I at least knew I couldn't handle that. I recently moved AGAIN, and I actually started my first year in college... And it was hell. I made it hell. I wouldn't study, I would just smoke as soon as I got back from class, and then cram all my assignments into last second sessions, and turn in mediocre shit as a result. It felt like I blinked and the semester was over.

That brings me to now-- or rather last Thursday-- where I decided enough was enough. All this free time I have, and I've wasted half of it with smoking. And it never even felt that good! But boy, did it feel better than going a day without it. So, on Wednesday the 8th, I smoked the last of my weed, and confided in my friend all about my endeavor. They have been SUPER supportive. The first 3 days were definitely the hardest, but after that it started to feel like I could do anything. Until my mom brought home a massive ""tip"" from her cleaning job. 

Yeah, thats right! My mom is a stoner, and actually is the reason I so easily fell into my addiction to begin with. And now that's proven more true than ever before. So basically, I now have the gift of a LOT of glorious looking weed. And I haven't smoked any of it. But as I feel even more stressed by the daily toils of life, I feel more tempted to reach for it. If I didn't tell my friend, I wouldn't have their trust to break, and I would have smoked it as soon as I got it, regardless of my decision to quit. But now I suffer.

Anyway, 7 days clean, and I'm trying not to break it. I don't know what to do with the weed, because I do want to smoke again on 4/20, but 1. look where that got me last time, and 2. look where its already taking me. I'm sure a lot of people will deeply question why I'm holding onto it at all haha.

I want to see how far I can get without weed. I want to get past one month and get back an inkling of clarity. I want to see where I am in a year, and how my dopamine receptors will react to a normal amount of input after all that time. I want to put my all into school because I CHOSE to go there. I want to be productive, and helpful, and thoughtful to those around me. But God fucking dammit, I want to smoke a fat bowl and call it a night. 

Anyway, I don't know how this post will be received. I'm sure I'll get some critics telling me to just dump my weed or give it back to my mom, but I'm stubborn for some reason. Tonight is a rough night for more than one reason, not even associated with weed. It's just how I would try to tolerate it before I tried being sober. I think I'm going to be okay, and I'm genuinely excited to meet myself again for the first time in years. I hope to find a sense of community here, even if it means I'll hear things I don't want to hear. All in all, if you read all this, thank you so much, it really means the world.

Even though Mumbai is a city of dreams, the bustle and fast-paced lifestyle can occasionally wear you down. The solution is frequently to take a weekend trip to a peaceful and revitalizing location. Approximately 260 miles south of Mumbai, Mahabaleshwar is a great place to go for a weekend escape.
 
MY EXPERIENCE
 
In June, when the rain was just getting started, I organized a weekend vacation to Mahabaleshwar with my pals, which is a veritable paradise. We hired a 6 seater Innova car for the six of us and paid INR 12,000 to and fro plus tolls for our road trip from Mumbai. It was a 4 and a half hour journey to our accomodation ' Hotel Blue Park'. Although, a budget hotel 2000/- per night for a duplex rooms, Its comparatively cheeper than the rates in the end of year.

 The first day, after reaching our hotel, we left for Venna lake which was 25 minutes away from the hotel. An open land, it felt extremely relaxing being there amidst the cool breeze and little droplets of rain hitting the face. You can spend time here boating, riding horses, or clicking pictures. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing maintenance work, boating was shut temporarily. After spending an hour there, we moved towards the main market and walked the streets before stopping by a restaurant to pack away dinner. The night was spent enjoying good food, drinks, and some music.

MAPRO GARDEN 
Our next destination was the Mapro garden. Mahabaleshwar is famous for Strawberries and when you are here, you can NOT miss visiting Mapro Garden. A lovely place to hang out with the entire family, you can also enjoy some delicious strawberry cream, ice creams, amazing sandwiches, and Pizza at the Mapro Garden cafe. My most favorite part here is the shopping area the one- stop for tempting syrups, crushes, and Mazana chocolates.

|SUMMARY |
Mahabaleshwar is one of the best weekend getaway options for people living in a busy city like Mumbai/ Pune. It is a great place to relax and unwind from the hectic and fast-paced life. An ideal trip to Mahabaleshwar should be 3 days long, to enjoy this beautiful place completely. 1. Stay- There are some great budget- friendly stay options in Mahabaleshwar. If you are going with friends and plan to stay outdoors most of the time, do not spend too much on luxury accommodation. The climate in Mahabaleshwar is pretty much enough to make you feel happy anywhere you decide to stay. 2. Best Time to Visit- The ideal time to plan a trip to Mahabaleshwar is June to September, during the monsoon. However, the place might be a little too crowded with tourists during monsoons, especially on weekends. 3. Food- When visiting a hill station, the best food to have is some pakodas and hot refreshing chai, which you get at tourist attractions like tableland, Venna Lake, etc. Sandwiches and Pizza at Mapro Gardens, though a little expensive, but are a must-try. 4.Shopping- Central market area is the place if you want to get touristy vibes as you can get some decent bags and home decor items, if you are good at bargaining. Apart from that, do not miss shopping for syrups and chocolates from Mapro Garden.
5. Travel- If you are travelling from Mumbai, a road trip is an ideal option as the view on the way is amazing and makes the journey even more worthwhile. Make sure you leave early morning around 6, to make it to Mahabaleshwar on time, without much traffic and with most of the day left to enjoy there. There are food courts on the way, where you can stop for a quick bite/ tea/ coffee.

Notes:
- always enjoy the cold open with Tom and Josh packaging sweets. That‚Äôs as expressive as Tom gets I‚Äôm afraid.

- Bonus points to anyone who can make all the treats he‚Äôs making. He mentions toffees, I see marshmallows and lollys, the rest tho?

- Arnold is just so goddamned cute on this wake up call, even as his closeted, mental stuff gets in the way of being obtrusively adorable

- Alan asking for Josh‚Äôs permission to marry Mae. Definitely an Alan move. Even balanced, reasonable adults turn into insecure versions of themselves once their kids get into their twenties.
 
- ‚ÄúSo many rules Arnold, so many ruuuules,‚Äù

- Alan choosing to get Josh a coffee cart is such a random pull. Maybe he knew a guy? Looking online, a nice cart with a bike is about $5k usd

- Talking about immature adults, here comes Stewart talking about his ‚Äúbitch wife‚Äù. Is Alan the only decent adult male on this show?

- Rose can leave the facility, and we learn Hannah was voluntary. Interesting how she described her ex we see in season 4. 

- ‚ÄúHow many grandmas died for this?‚Äù

- Doesn‚Äôt make sense that Alan would loudly exclaim to everyone including Rose his intent on proposing to Mae.

- Hate this therapist sooo much. No wonder Arnold is struggling.

- When Josh says there won‚Äôt be any blowfish, that would have been a good time for Arnold to talk about being vegetarian.

- Hannah and the baby kill me. Shocked she agreed to hold her. ‚ÄúDo you watch much Alfred Hitchcock?‚Äù
 
- ‚ÄúDo you want to borrow my camel chinos?‚Äù I actually turned on subtitles to check that.
 
- Hannah comparing herself to Josef Fritzl to make herself feel better‚Ä¶ cuz he‚Äôs ‚Äúbad at life‚Äù. I googled that reference and‚Ä¶ well that was hideous. Weird pull to mention a cretin from Austria. This North American had never heard this name before.

- I loathe the whole possum scenario. Hate how disruptive it was, hate what actually happened, hate the effect on Arnold 

- Stewart is a gross love bomber

**Background:**

My wife and I both have laptops for work with different levels of permissible ""personal use"", and therefore want our own machine(s) we don't have to worry about while using. Neither of us are very sophisticated PC users; while we are colloquially ""tech savvy"" and good at following instructions after a google search, most of our experience as adults is on Macs, and neither of us have any kind of technical computer training.

**Challenges:**

**1.** My wife would prefer to have a personal laptop that she can use whenever, wherever, as she frequently likes to write at the library or a coffee shop. I would prefer a gaming PC, as my primary use would be gaming, as well as some 3d modeling/printing down the road.

2. We are not looking to spend a ton of money, somewhere between 1-2k total, which is what buying a new macbook would cost.

3. Our relative unsophistication is inevitably a major hurdle to some solutions (custom programs, highly technical networking, other things I don't know exist, etc.)

**Thoughts:**

1. I am hoping that something like multi-seating or Virtual Machines will provide what we both want from a single PC. My understanding is that both of these are viable options, but that VMing is more technical, while  buying a software like Aster is more user friendly, but also more expensive. (Though I don't know if there is a way to use them with laptop/portable display on a separate wifi network. I am aware that remote PC access is a thing, but I don't understand how/if that is compatible or even necessary with something like Aster.)

2. It is very important that we be able to work/game simultaneously. (We aren't specifically looking to game at the same time, though that capability would be nice.) I am hesitant because with Aster I have almost exclusively found posts online related to multiple gaming sessions, but since it is marketed to businesses and schools, I assume that functions of the simultaneous sessions are not limited in any way.

  
I know I can't be the first person to contemplate such a set up, and certainly don't have the expertise to endeavor out on my own, so any advice is much appreciated! (Build questions are sure to follow!)",1,1737098174.0,pcmasterrace,1,1.0,False

1i3awlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1i3awlq/unfiltered_coffee_vs_filtered_coffee/,Unfiltered  Coffee vs Filtered Coffee,"Just thinking about whether coffee is beneficial for gut health as a prebiotic. Since coffee is a fermented product, I wanted to know what kind of benefits it could have. I asked ChatGPT.......

# How Coffee Acts as a Prebiotic

* Coffee contains compounds such as **dietary polyphenols** and **soluble fibers** that can serve as food for beneficial gut bacteria.
* Specifically:
   * **Chlorogenic acids**: A type of polyphenol found in coffee that can stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria like *Bifidobacteria*.
   * **Fiber**: In certain types of coffee (like unfiltered coffee), some soluble fibers may support gut health.

# Factors to Consider

1. **Type of Coffee**: Black coffee without sugar or milk is most likely to have prebiotic effects. Additives like cream, sugar, or artificial sweeteners may reduce these benefits or counteract them.
2. **Moderation**: While coffee may support gut health, excessive consumption can irritate the stomach or intestines, especially for individuals with sensitive digestive systems.
3. **Individual Response**: The prebiotic potential of coffee can vary based on individual gut microbiota composition.

**Unfiltered coffee** refers to coffee that is brewed without the use of a paper filter or a similar mechanism to remove fine coffee grounds and oils. As a result, it contains more of the natural compounds found in coffee beans, such as oils, sediments, and certain micronutrients. The brewing methods typically associated with unfiltered coffee include:

# Examples of Unfiltered Coffee

1. **French Press**:
   * Uses a metal mesh filter that allows fine grounds and oils to pass through into the brewed coffee.
2. **Turkish Coffee**:
   * Finely ground coffee is boiled directly in water, and the grounds are left to settle in the cup.
3. **Espresso**:
   * Prepared using high pressure to force hot water through finely ground coffee, resulting in a concentrated brew with oils and tiny particles.
4. **Boiled Coffee**:
   * Methods like Scandinavian or cowboy coffee involve boiling coarse grounds in water, which remain in the brew.
5. **Moka Pot**:
   * Produces a strong coffee using steam pressure but doesn‚Äôt typically use paper filters, allowing some oils and particles to remain.

# Key Characteristics of Unfiltered Coffee

* **Rich Flavor**: Retains natural coffee oils and fine particles, resulting in a fuller, often stronger taste.
* **Higher Oil Content**: Contains *cafestol* and *kahweol*, natural oils that contribute to coffee's flavor and health effects.
* **Texture**: May have a slightly gritty texture due to the fine grounds or sediment.

# Health Considerations

* **Potential Benefits**: Rich in antioxidants and bioactive compounds like polyphenols, which can support health.
* **Cholesterol Impact**: Unfiltered coffee contains higher levels of cafestol and kahweol, which can increase LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels when consumed in large amounts over time. Filtering coffee with a paper filter significantly reduces these compounds.

Unfiltered coffee is favored by those who enjoy bold flavors and traditional brewing methods, but its health effects depend on individual consumption habits.

# Bottom Line

Coffee, particularly when consumed in moderation and without excessive additives, can contribute to gut health and support beneficial bacteria, making it a mild prebiotic. However, it's not as strong a source of prebiotics as foods like garlic, bananas, or onions.

1i3at1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1i3at1v/unfiltered_coffees/,Unfiltered Coffees,"# Key Characteristics of Unfiltered Coffee

* **Rich Flavor**: Retains natural coffee oils and fine particles, resulting in a fuller, often stronger taste.
* **Higher Oil Content**: Contains *cafestol* and *kahweol*, natural oils that contribute to coffee's flavor and health effects.
* **Texture**: May have a slightly gritty texture due to the fine grounds or sediment.

# Health Considerations

* **Potential Benefits**: Rich in antioxidants and bioactive compounds like polyphenols, which can support health.
* **Cholesterol Impact**: Unfiltered coffee contains higher levels of cafestol and kahweol, which can increase LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels when consumed in large amounts over time. Filtering coffee with a paper filter significantly reduces these compounds.

Unfiltered coffee is favored by those who enjoy bold flavors and traditional brewing methods, but its health effects depend on individual consumption habits.

# How Coffee Acts as a Prebiotic

* Coffee contains compounds such as **dietary polyphenols** and **soluble fibers** that can serve as food for beneficial gut bacteria.
* Specifically:
   * **Chlorogenic acids**: A type of polyphenol found in coffee that can stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria like *Bifidobacteria*.
   * **Fiber**: In certain types of coffee (like unfiltered coffee), some soluble fibers may support gut health.

# Factors to Consider

1. **Type of Coffee**: Black coffee without sugar or milk is most likely to have prebiotic effects. Additives like cream, sugar, or artificial sweeteners may reduce these benefits or counteract them.
2. **Moderation**: While coffee may support gut health, excessive consumption can irritate the stomach or intestines, especially for individuals with sensitive digestive systems.
3. **Individual Response**: The prebiotic potential of coffee can vary based on individual gut microbiota composition.

# Bottom Line

Coffee, particularly when consumed in moderation and without excessive additives, can contribute to gut health and support beneficial bacteria, making it a mild prebiotic. However, it's not as strong a source of prebiotics as foods like garlic, bananas, or onions.",2,1737097483.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

1i3aqcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensofKerala/comments/1i3aqcu/her_father_saw_us_in_the_cafe/,Her father saw us in the cafe ,"There was this girl who was a new admission to the tuition center where I study. She is the kind who doesn‚Äôt talk much. But when she starts to talk, she makes me wonder. We talked about many things on the very first day.

After the evening tuition class was over, she would walk all alone through a narrow road that ends up at the main road. I usually go back home on my Splendor bike. So, while I was riding back that day, I saw her walking alone. I stopped beside her and offered her a lift. But she said it was fine and told me she preferred to walk.

On the second day, I offered her a lift again, as it felt like the right thing to do. She politely declined again, saying she would walk. So I said bye, and she said bye back with a small smile.

On the third day, she surprised me by asking if I could give her a lift. I said, ""Why not?"" She climbed onto my Splendor, and we started moving. I noticed she was keeping a little distance from me, not even touching me. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile, though she couldn‚Äôt see my smile because of my helmet.

While riding, I asked if we could stop for some coffee. At first, she hesitated, but after a little convincing, she agreed. We headed to a small cafe in the city.

The cafe was simple, with 5 or 6 white tables. We sat down and ordered coffee. But I noticed something strange. she kept looking sideways and seemed nervous. I asked her, ""What happened?"" She whispered that the couple sitting on the other side of the cafe was her mom and dad, and they had already seen her.

Oh my God, I thought to myself. She looked scared. I wondered, Did I do something wrong? What‚Äôs so bad about two friends having coffee together? But she was clearly in fear. Her eyes said it all. She kept glancing at them and finally, in a rush, said, ""Njn pova."" Without waiting for my response, she stood up and left the cafe.

Now, I was sitting alone at the table, unsure of what to think. After a while, her mom and dad finished their coffee and came over to my table. Her dad looked at me, smiled, and asked, ""Ente makalude koode padikkune aano?""

I quickly replied, ""No uncle, tuition.""

He smiled and said, ""Aaha. Ithentha, coffeeo? Avalkku coffee ishtam allada."" After a short pause, he continued, ""Ntha onnum mindaathe?""

I replied, ""Nothing, uncle.""

He smiled kindly and said, ""Poor girl, she must have been surprised to see us. Avalkk shake okke ishtava! Next time, avalle villich oru shake vangich kodukk tto.""

With that, her dad and mom walked away, leaving me speechless. I never expected such a warm and friendly response from a girl‚Äôs father. His words made me feel relieved, and I finally caught my breath.

Every location, from the energetic tech center of Bangalore to the regal allure of Mysore and the cold, foggy hills of Ooty, has something special and remarkable to offer.  This trip was filled with adventure, culture, and unforgettable memories.""

Bangalore, a city that skillfully combines modernity and tradition, is where my adventure started. The expansive parks, the vibrant IT centers, and the delicious South Indian food all enthralled me. The magnificent Bangalore Palace, the tranquil Lalbagh Botanical Garden, and the energetic UB City were must-see sights. I began my trip by visiting the Lalbagh Botanical Garden, which was teeming with lush vegetation and an amazing assortment of plant species. The serene setting was the ideal diversion from the busy city life. The Glasshouse, where the renowned flower shows are held, is a must-see. Later that day, I went to the famous Vidhana Soudha, a stunning building that serves as the home of the Karnataka state legislature.

From Banglore I traveled to Mysore, a city rich in history . I was amazed by the beautiful Mysore Palace's elaborate architecture and stunning lights. I also went to the fascinating Chamundeshwari Temple, the serene Brindavan Gardens, and the bustling Devaraja Market.The splendor of Mysore Palace astounded me. The elaborate architecture,  interiors, and historical significance left me speechless. Don't miss the nightly light and sound show to grasp the palace's grandeur.  After a quick trip up Chamundi Hill, I arrived at the Chamundeshwari Temple, where I prayed and took in the expansive views of Mysore. Later, I went to see one of India's tallest churches, the magnificent St. Philomena's Church. 

Ooty, a charming hill station tucked away in the Nilgiri Hills, was the destination of my last stop. A pleasant diversion from the busy cities was provided by the cool weather, abundant vegetation, and stunning vistas. I enjoyed a serene boat ride on Ooty Lake,  and an exploration of the expansive Botanical Garden. One of the highlights of my trip was riding the Nilgiri Mountain Railway. 

Best time to visit:  October- June are the best months to go because of the nice weather. Transportation: For a comfortable trip, combine local taxis, trains, and airplanes. 

 Accommodations: Make reservations well in advance, particularly during busy times.

Foods you must try:Mysore pak, filter coffee, masala dosa, and bisi bele bath. When shopping, look for local handicrafts, spices, and sandalwood products. 

My trip to Bangalore, Mysore, and Ooty was the ideal fusion of culture, history, and the natural world. From the tech-heavy streets of Bangalore to the regal splendor of Mysore and the tranquil hill towns of Ooty, every city had a unique charm of its own. In order to fully appreciate each destination's beauty, I advise you to take your time exploring it at a leisurely pace if you're organizing a similar trip.

I overthink things like kitchen etiquette and end up making it worse by being anxious. Even though I try to be thoughtful, my awkwardness seems to ruin the vibe. I don‚Äôt want people to feel weird around me or avoid me anymore. Any advice on how to fix this would mean a lot!**

***NOTE: Also, this is a private lodging space. It isn't a typical 'sharehouse'. But, everyone is familiar with each other and respectful, but does their own thing.***

There's so much to say  
The thing is I'm extremely awkward, i have nothing to say to people, i can't even make regular small chit chat

I clean up after myself and everyone has their chores and I do mine every week, and I do it properly, and rent is always paid on time etc etc. But when it comes to the social stuff, I've made people feel so awkward that they AVOID me, and I hate that. I hate that they feel that way with someone in the house, because you should be able to come home and just feel comfortable, and I HATE that I'm that person as well that has this effect.

It's not what I'm doing, per se. It's what I'm NOT doing, I think. I have never been rude to anyone, however, I won't talk much and I'll just say Hi. The other day I came in, and my housemate said 'Hey! How are you?' and I think he wanted to strike up a conversation. I said 'Good, How are you?' in a really neutral tone. I just can't carry a conversation. I've had the most stressful 2 years and I feel like i have no fuel in the tank. I'm also studying, and I live pay to pay, it's genuinely exhausting - the mental load. I've encountered some really shitty people in the past 2 years and I think that I just have decided I'm not going to let anyone in for a period of time, not consciously, but yeah. But these moments I think may start to make people feel awkward around me, cause I'm not being rude, but I'm not really engaging either, and I guess it leaves things in the air, and it's like an unresolved sort of thing.

Because I'm so quiet they may not know what I'm thinking, or whether I even like them. It probably comes across to them that I want nothing to do with them. It's not the case necessarily. I'm just terrified I'm going to open my mouth & say something stupid. I can't even hold a conversation anymore, I really can't. It's like I'm not interested in anything, i'm just meh about it. And if I do talk, it sounds so serious, which I don't mean to be, but that's kind of my temperament.

The thing that I will say is this. Everyone is very respectful of each other in shared spaces, and everyone has their routine & schedule. I still feel like, after 6 months, I haven't been able to establish a consistent routine, and I think this is part of the problem. People can't predict when I'll be in the kitchen, when I'll be home or out. My schedules change cause i work shifts & I study. But I also am someone who just needs space to sit in my room alone and wind down for a few hours. I don't like to go out all the time. The thing is, sometimes i want to go and get food from the kitchen, and someone is out at the same time. I do usually go ahead. I don't understand the etiquette. Then, they just retreat back to their room. I was so confused, and then I felt so bad. But, in the moment, I'm so anxious about interrupting people's space, I'm making it worse. Sometimes, people will have a day off and I'll be home. I'm trying to find a time to meal prep, and I'll do it then. Then, the guy who's home on his day off seems irritated. So, now, I need to find another time to cook, but then someone needs the kitchen. But, I'm the only one with this issue, everyone else seems to have it figured out. I've started just chopping my salad in my room because I like having my own space and not feeling rushed. But, sometimes I just want to spend 20-30mins in the kitchen, but it's just not what everyone else does. I don't understand why this is an issue for people, but it is, and I think it's contributing to them not liking me. That I may be using shared spaces for longer periods of time than others. I do it when it's quiet, but I'll take 20mins instead of 5 mins occasionally. I think this is somehow one of the issues. The other day, I was in the kitchen for 20 mins and my roommate held off coming in to boil the kettle until I was finished. But, I was taking 'a while' \[i was only in there for 20mins\] so she just came and did it (we have an unspoken rule that when someone's in the kitchen we let them be). After, I noticed they moved the kettle and placed it on top of the microwave. Which I think is a great idea. That way we can boil water for tea/coffee without interrupting the person cooking in the kitchen. But it's things like this I think that's making people feel awkward around me, or annoyed with me.

Also, the other thing is, on a personal note, I feel like i have so much to do. like, the window in my room is kinda loose and has come out a bit from the wood - I have 4 panels, so it's only 1 panel. And the mattress is terrible, so I've been sleeping on the floor for the past 6 months. There are also mold spores in my room, so I've bought some vinegar and am cleaning those, and then I got a dehumidifier which has been amazing for the space. But I have allergies to dustmites & mould, so it just hasn't been ideal. And sometimes  guess i just feel jealous or something, or I want a break from people cause I have so many things to just figure out and fix. I also am constantly thinking about how to not interrupt people much, so I need to buy a thermos so I can just make coffee in my room throughout the day. Others manage to stay in their room all day/night, but I go in and out. So, maybe people feel like i;m not accommodating them, but I have all this shit to fix and do just for basic necessities PLUS study PLUS cook and buy groceries PLUS budget etc etc. I'm just like at capacity. 

Here's the other thing. It's not all bad. I work in retail while studying, and I've brought home chocolates - they're really good quality - and people just eat them up. I've left a note saying 'Please Help Yourself! Enjoy xx'. After that, my other housemate brought home croissants from his restaurant, and left a note which read the exact same way. So, I think he just kind of followed suit with how I had left a note. The other thing is, since it's really hot at the moment, at night, I left my door open a little while sleeping. No one else did this before, but afterwards, I noticed others would leave their open a little open while they were just hanging out. So, I have some positive effect on people. But the fact that I'm awkward undermines everything! I can't read social cues for the life of me & i just want to know what I'm doing so I can stop it.

I need to turn this around. I've lived here for 6 months & I don't want to have this effect on people. One of the things is, I think, that i come across 'competent'. Like, it's weird cause i have the worst social skills but you can tell that I'm not an idiot I guess. And I think this has something to do with it. I've noticed at work as well, that sometimes people think I'm 'smart' and I can tell they start to feel insecure around me, second guessing themselves, speaking in a more 'formal' way even though that isn't how they usually talk. I don't think of myself this way, but I don't know wtf is going on in other people's minds. I always have my own ideas & can be creative and original with the way I do even the smallest of tasks. I love efficiency & precision, combined. It's like heaven to me.

So I just need to know, if anyone has been around people who have been awkward. In the beginning you give them a few chances, but sometimes, with some people, after a while, you just avoid them. Whenever you've been in that situation, could you reply & let me know what the hell I may be doing and give me some advice. I get the whole neurodiversity thing, but I like living here and I HATE that they feel awkward, it's such an annoying feeling. I also don't want them to avoid me. I just need to change & I need to turn this around.

That‚Äôs all changed recently though because all the pretty candle warming lamps everywhere this year, I had to get one . I started with happy Hanukkah which is a fresh incense type smell, I really like it and the throw is pretty strong the first few burns . Filled the entire house and lasted .

Bold coffee, with relaxing lavender, but it‚Äôs sweet as well , almost like a touch of marshmallow, I can‚Äôt wait to use this candle .  Seems like it might be a lite one though.   

Another thing ! I love plug ins !  I have so many of the plain wallflowers, usually the black ones that light up but I have never been into the decorative ones ‚Ä¶. Why not ?  Why aren‚Äôt I been getting all the different beautiful wallflowers? They will last years and years and can be switched out, all these times when I got some small spray that I didn‚Äôt even really want to redeem my reward and I could have been collecting wallflowers üòÇ from here on out, I will be getting those all the time .  I stood there for like 30 mins trying to choose between the iridescent bubbles, stitched butterfly with gems, floral butterfly and sea turtles , I finally grabbed the floral butterfly and the sea turtles with my free reward . 

Also very excited for the next body mist sale !   I‚Äôm going to stock up on the guilty ad fig, smells just like phlur father figure.

I had been traveling/ living in my vehicle and then small van since July 2024 because that was the only way I could afford to be autonomous from my parents who are controlling, religious, and emotionally tumultuous. 

I am 25 turning 26 in March. And all I have dreamed about since I was 13 or 14 was being in my twenties and being free from the difficult emotions of living with my parents. 

My twenties has been nothing but a tumultuous nightmare unfolding slowly while I rely on my parents but try to carve out space for myself and whenever I feel like I‚Äôve finally or almost found something. Something goes wrong. They tear me down.

I feel like they don‚Äôt want me to ever be stable though they‚Äôll say through their teeth that they do but then won‚Äôt support me in what I want to do. 

I‚Äôve tried so many things. I‚Äôve had like 5 therapists, tried multiple medications, done healthy eating and exercise programs. Gone out and made friends. 

I‚Äôve started and not finished massage therapy school, cosmetology school, and a bachelors degree. I‚Äôm supposed to finally receive the bachelors degree this Spring 2025 (fingers crossed). So I know that I am blessed and privileged for that. 

I‚Äôve had like 6 different minimum wage (ish) jobs. Working at a preschool, daycare, eatery, coffee shop, DoorDash, and some freelance writing/editing. I ended up with conflict at the eatery and coffee shop and quit those both after 2-3 months. I got tired of working with other peoples preschool aged kids eventually. I‚Äôm interviewing for a job at a dog daycare next. I just feel like at any minimum wage (ish) job i end up with nasty conflict with the manager or boss. Because they tend to have a personality type that makes me feel micromanaged. 

But I feel distraught and depressed and like I‚Äôll never function outside of this narcissistic loop with my parents. 

I am stuck here because my van needs repairs. I had come to stay for a bit to save some money and then get back to traveling. I had not planned to be stuck with a broken car and relying on my mom for transportation. 

I‚Äôm really nervous about a new job but I need to make money to fix my car. My mom ends up yelling at me for how much money she has spent on me.

But at the end of the day, she is part of what has me where I am. I was so depressed my middle school and high school years because I am always on eggshells in my house. 

My autism seems to be PDA profile but I really attribute that to my parents being so controlling. ",1,1737096383.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False
1i3ajfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i3ajfi/caffeine_withdrawl/,Caffeine withdrawl?,"Hey guys, so 22 days ago I quit drinking all caffeine cold turkey. I got to the point that I felt zapped out all year and just felt exhausted so I knew I had to make a change and so I set out to get rid of this caffeine habit. I've been drinking some sort of caffeine daily since I became a truck driver 8 years ago and even prior to that I drank monsters and red bulls before the gym so let's say to be fair I've been drinking caffeine for 12 years. Now, I have limited my intake for the previous year and worked my way down to half a cup of Starbucks iced coffee. (Approx. 8 oz in the morning). So here's how each week went.

Week 1 very tired
Week 2 slept better but not fully rested and noticeably more anxious during the day
Week 3 much more anxious but suddenly I've been getting terrible sleep. If I fall Asleep I am up in the morning feeling okay but by the afternoon I feel exhausted. Now last night I tried to go to bed early and here I am at 2am still unable to fall asleep so it appears I've gotten a degree of insomnia.

My questions: is it normal to have these types of things happening after quitting caffeine?

Is it withdrawl? How long does it take for body's natural energy to return? 

I had a friend who drank monster daily who just went and quit cold turkey and he's had only good things to say like you fall asleep naturally at night and you feel naturally awake all day. 

I was hoping to experience these positive changes but here I am feeling terrible lately and I'm so tempted to going back to drinking coffee again just so I can have some type of energy even if artifical but then I'm reminded why I began this journey in first place and makes me think I should just keep going to see if it changes.

Sleep has become noticeably worse for me around 2020 when my mom passed away maybe there's a trauma factor involved there but also I struggle with anxiety last maybe decade of my life so I'm not sure what the reason is but I just want normal sleep and to be fully energized without artificial means.

**I‚Äôm super awkward and bad at small talk, which makes my housemates feel uncomfortable and avoid me. I always pay rent, do my chores, and sometimes bring treats like chocolates, but I‚Äôm not great at social stuff, and my inconsistent schedule (from work and study) seems to add to the weirdness. I overthink things like kitchen etiquette and end up making it worse by being anxious. Even though I try to be thoughtful, my awkwardness seems to ruin the vibe. I don‚Äôt want people to feel weird around me or avoid me anymore. Any advice on how to fix this would mean a lot!**

***NOTE: Also, this is a private lodging space. It isn't a typical 'sharehouse'. But, everyone is familiar with each other and respectful, but does their own thing.***

There's so much to say  
The thing is I'm extremely awkward, i have nothing to say to people, i can't even make regular small chit chat

I clean up after myself and everyone has their chores and I do mine every week, and I do it properly, and rent is always paid on time etc etc. But when it comes to the social stuff, I've made people feel so awkward that they AVOID me, and I hate that. I hate that they feel that way with someone in the house, because you should be able to come home and just feel comfortable, and I HATE that I'm that person as well that has this effect.

It's not what I'm doing, per se. It's what I'm NOT doing, I think. I have never been rude to anyone, however, I won't talk much and I'll just say Hi. The other day I came in, and my housemate said 'Hey! How are you?' and I think he wanted to strike up a conversation. I said 'Good, How are you?' in a really neutral tone. I just can't carry a conversation. I've had the most stressful 2 years and I feel like i have no fuel in the tank. I'm also studying, and I live pay to pay, it's genuinely exhausting - the mental load. I've encountered some really shitty people in the past 2 years and I think that I just have decided I'm not going to let anyone in for a period of time, not consciously, but yeah. But these moments I think may start to make people feel awkward around me, cause I'm not being rude, but I'm not really engaging either, and I guess it leaves things in the air, and it's like an unresolved sort of thing.

Because I'm so quiet they may not know what I'm thinking, or whether I even like them. It probably comes across to them that I want nothing to do with them. It's not the case necessarily. I'm just terrified I'm going to open my mouth & say something stupid. I can't even hold a conversation anymore, I really can't. It's like I'm not interested in anything, i'm just meh about it. And if I do talk, it sounds so serious, which I don't mean to be, but that's kind of my temperament.

The thing that I will say is this. Everyone is very respectful of each other in shared spaces, and everyone has their routine & schedule. I still feel like, after 6 months, I haven't been able to establish a consistent routine, and I think this is part of the problem. People can't predict when I'll be in the kitchen, when I'll be home or out. My schedules change cause i work shifts & I study. But I also am someone who just needs space to sit in my room alone and wind down for a few hours. I don't like to go out all the time. The thing is, sometimes i want to go and get food from the kitchen, and someone is out at the same time. I do usually go ahead. I don't understand the etiquette. Then, they just retreat back to their room. I was so confused, and then I felt so bad. But, in the moment, I'm so anxious about interrupting people's space, I'm making it worse. Sometimes, people will have a day off and I'll be home. I'm trying to find a time to meal prep, and I'll do it then. Then, the guy who's home on his day off seems irritated. So, now, I need to find another time to cook, but then someone needs the kitchen. But, I'm the only one with this issue, everyone else seems to have it figured out. I've started just chopping my salad in my room because I like having my own space and not feeling rushed. But, sometimes I just want to spend 20-30mins in the kitchen, but it's just not what everyone else does. I don't understand why this is an issue for people, but it is, and I think it's contributing to them not liking me. That I may be using shared spaces for longer periods of time than others. I do it when it's quiet, but I'll take 20mins instead of 5 mins occasionally. I think this is somehow one of the issues. The other day, I was in the kitchen for 20 mins and my roommate held off coming in to boil the kettle until I was finished. But, I was taking 'a while' \[i was only in there for 20mins\] so she just came and did it (we have an unspoken rule that when someone's in the kitchen we let them be). After, I noticed they moved the kettle and placed it on top of the microwave. Which I think is a great idea. That way we can boil water for tea/coffee without interrupting the person cooking in the kitchen. But it's things like this I think that's making people feel awkward around me, or annoyed with me.

  
Also, the other thing is, on a personal note, I feel like i have so much to do. like, the window in my room is kinda loose and has come out a bit from the wood - I have 4 panels, so it's only 1 panel. And the mattress is terrible, so I've been sleeping on the floor for the past 6 months. There are also mold spores in my room, so I've bought some vinegar and am cleaning those, and then I got a dehumidifier which has been amazing for the space. But I have allergies to dustmites & mould, so it just hasn't been ideal. And sometimes  guess i just feel jealous or something, or I want a break from people cause I have so many things to just figure out and fix. I also am constantly thinking about how to not interrupt people much, so I need to buy a thermos so I can just make coffee in my room throughout the day. Others manage to stay in their room all day/night, but I go in and out. So, maybe people feel like i;m not accommodating them, but I have all this shit to fix and do just for basic necessities PLUS study PLUS cook and buy groceries PLUS budget etc etc. I'm just like at capacity. 

Here's the other thing. It's not all bad. I work in retail while studying, and I've brought home chocolates - they're really good quality - and people just eat them up. I've left a note saying 'Please Help Yourself! Enjoy xx'. After that, my other housemate brought home croissants from his restaurant, and left a note which read the exact same way. So, I think he just kind of followed suit with how I had left a note. The other thing is, since it's really hot at the moment, at night, I left my door open a little while sleeping. No one else did this before, but afterwards, I noticed others would leave their open a little open while they were just hanging out. So, I have some positive effect on people. But the fact that I'm awkward undermines everything! I can't read social cues for the life of me & i just want to know what I'm doing so I can stop it.

I need to turn this around. I've lived here for 6 months & I don't want to have this effect on people. One of the things is, I think, that i come across 'competent'. Like, it's weird cause i have the worst social skills but you can tell that I'm not an idiot I guess. And I think this has something to do with it. I've noticed at work as well, that sometimes people think I'm 'smart' and I can tell they start to feel insecure around me, second guessing themselves, speaking in a more 'formal' way even though that isn't how they usually talk. I don't think of myself this way, but I don't know wtf is going on in other people's minds. I always have my own ideas & can be creative and original with the way I do even the smallest of tasks. I love efficiency & precision, combined. It's like heaven to me.

So I just need to know, if anyone has been around people who have been awkward. In the beginning you give them a few chances, but sometimes, with some people, after a while, you just avoid them. Whenever you've been in that situation, could you reply & let me know what the hell I may be doing and give me some advice. I get the whole neurodiversity thing, but I like living here and I HATE that they feel awkward, it's such an annoying feeling. I also don't want them to avoid me. I just need to change & I need to turn this around.

I read a ton of posts on here to prepare but really wanted one that went into way too much detail. So here's that post, which I hope can help at least one future neurotic woman about to undergo some or all of these surgeries.

**Backstory**

I am 41, nearly 42, and I have had very painful periods since my teens. I have brought this up at every annual exam and asked if we could investigate or I could get some muscle relaxers or something, and each time I was told that menstrual pain is normal and every woman goes through it.

I went vegan 20 years ago, which helped a lot, then I started working out and using the stick-on heating pads, tracking my periods, and taking a ton of naproxen before the worst of the pain started. I was able to get by, but I still dreaded my periods.

In the past year or so things started getting worse. For one, my cycle was always around 25 days but in recent years it's shortened to 21 days. For two, my husband and I started trying to build a family when I was 38, and it was becoming clearer that this wasn't working. For three, I stopped being able to eat. Foods that I could previously tolerate were not sitting well, and pooping hurt. Man, did it hurt.

**Diagnosis**

In September, I went to a specialist who did an ultrasound and found that my pelvis was, in her words, ""a mess"". I had frozen pelvis, fibroids, endometriomas, cysts on my ovaries, and a big ol' mass growing in my sigmoid colon. Suddenly all my digestive issues made sense.

She let me know that I would likely need a full bowel resection, and we discussed the pros and cons of an excision vs. a hysterectomy. I almost passed out during the appointment because I am queasy when it comes to medical things. On the drive home I called my husband and told him what had happened. After a few minutes he had to get back to work, so I got off the phone and sobbed the rest of the drive - I was relieved to have a diagnosis, I was enraged that it took more than twenty years, I was scared my husband would leave me for someone younger with functional reproductive organs.

I scheduled my surgery for early January, then began an excruciating few months of trying to sort out everything to take short term disability and getting myself physically and emotionally ready for surgery.

**Surgery Prep**

The bowel resection meant that I had to do a *full* bowel prep. I've never had a colonoscopy and I was very nervous about this part. I wasn't allowed to eat the day before my surgery and had to overdose on stool softeners then take 14 once-a-day doses of laxatives over the course of a few hours. I did it all then... nothing. I read online that things should start happening within 30-60 minutes or beginning the prep. More than two hours after the process was underway I started feeling a little yucky, then the prepping began. It was honestly nowhere near as bad as I'd built it up in my head (except that the hospital kept calling to go over all sorts of administrative things while I tried to act like I was not desperate to run to the bathroom - I think it was a giant practical joke on their part). That night, I took a long shower and had to scrub myself with hibiclens before sleeping in clean PJs and freshly-washed sheets, then in the morning I had to do an enema (also not pleasant but not anywhere near as bad as I'd built it up to be) followed by another scrub and hibiclens.

**Surgery Day**

My husband slept separately from me the night before surgery since I was all cleaned and prepped. I woke up around 2am and we left for the hospital a little before 4am for a 5:30am check-in. We ended up arriving stupidly early (well before 5am) and waited in the car until right around 5am. I checked in and we waited in the lobby for a while, then they called me up to get my hospital wristband and sent me to another room, where we waited some more. Finally, a nurse called us back and had me change into a hospital gown and put my clothes in a bag marked ""PATIENT BELONGINGS"" which felt a little like checking into jail (I assume).

I had my nose pierced on a whim not long after my diagnosis, so it wasn't quite healed enough to be left piercing-free during my surgery. I had asked during one of my pre-op appointments whether it would be okay to wear a non-metal retainer and the nurse said ""I don't know but I would ask forgiveness rather than permission"" so I did, and the OR prep nurse told me I could leave my little glass retainer in it as long as she could tape it. Small win!

The surgeons then came in and spoke with me - first the colorectal surgeon, then the GYN surgeons. Each time that someone new came by they asked me to confirm my name, DOB, and what I was there for. With the GYN surgeons, we discussed what would happen if both my ovaries and/or tubes were nonfunctional. I said to please contact my husband first, but that he had my permission to green light a hysterectomy if need be.

The anesthetist then came by, had me confirm my name, DOB, and what surgeries I would be having, then gave me some details about what he would be doing. Finally, the OR nurse came in, confirmed the same things, and assured me that I was in good hands. She had the warmest energy and even though I was terrified by this point I felt safe with her. She put these little leg squeezy machines on my legs to prevent blood clots during surgery, then a little later I said goodbye to my husband and she wheeled me into the OR. We had a nice chat on the way (seriously. just the loveliest woman) and they had me transfer myself to the operating bed, then they told me they would be starting the anesthetic soon.

I woke up a split second later in another room, except really it was more than five hours later. My first thought was that they had decided not to do the surgery for some reason. A nurse told me that I was very sleepy and I agreed, then she let me know that the surgery was over and that it had gone well. I asked if they had taken my uterus and she said that I would need to speak to my surgical team. A while later another nurse let me know it was time to go to my room, and I asked her if I still had my uterus, she said that she didn't know and I should ask my doctors.

My husband was in my room. They hooked me up to IV liquids and various monitors, then everyone left except my husband. I asked him if everything was okay and if they'd done a hysterectomy. He said that everything was great, my uterus should (theoretically) work, and that it was still intact.

I was on ice chips only that night, then moved onto clear liquids the following morning.

**Hospital Stay**

I was in the hospital a total of five days, four nights. On the first night they had me stand at the edge of my bed but they didn't make me start walking until the day after my surgery. This was partly because I still had the catheter in until the morning after my surgery (everyone gets a catheter for abdominal surgery, for most excisions my understanding is that they take it out while the patient is asleep - since my surgery was a little more involved they left it in), so my mobility was limited. I also kept my leg squeezy machines on most of the time that I was in the hospital (apparently some patients hate them, I loved them), which was one more barrier to getting up.

Beginning the following morning I was able to (very gingerly) get up. With help I was able to walk myself to the bathroom, then was able to shut the door and be alone. This was one of the things I was most worried about pre-surgery (and even if I had needed help it would have been okay). Unfortunately, it took a while to regain control of my pelvic muscles, so peeing was an issue. I was able to pee once by sitting down and thinking about peeing (though I couldn't actually feel anything, very weird), but after that time I couldn't recreate the magic. They did a bladder scan and my bladder was pretty full and they were concerned. A few hours and failed pee attempts later they did another scan and my bladder was *very* full (over 800 mL). They contacted my doctors, who agreed that I needed a straight catheter. It was not fun, but not as awful as I'd imagined.

The rest of the stay was relatively uneventful. I started being able to get up more and more, especially as I shedded my various monitors and IV hookups. There was a lot of sleeping, and my husband would visit and take me on longer and longer walks - first a few doors down and back, then half a lap, and by the end I was doing full laps around the floor even when he wasn't there.

I had a bit of backtracking when I threw up my first ""full liquid"" meal and was moved back onto clear liquids. There were also a few miscommunications re: food in general - my first meal was chicken broth despite bringing up my veganism at every pre-op appointment and to every nurse to make sure that I wouldn't be served something I couldn't digest when too drugged to notice. My first ""full liquid"" meal was oatmeal, despite the doctors saying I shouldn't eat oatmeal for several weeks, and I was served coffee over and over again despite being told explicitly that coffee would be too harsh on my newly-resected colon.

I started my period a couple of days into my hospital stay. I recognized menstrual pain one night among my other aches and pains, which was confirmed the next time I went to the bathroom. It was less painful than most periods, but I was also on way more drugs than most periods.

After five days I was served my first real food (some pasta), and once I could keep it down they said I could go home! I had an ON-Q pain pump that was due to come out the next day, so I asked if the nurses could remove it at the hospital rather than me having to deal with it at home. They obliged, and I went home with two bandages over their entry points and no other tubes or wires or anything. My incisions were sealed with glue that has been slowly coming off.

**At-Home Recovery/Pain Levels**

Since coming home recovery has been fine. My doctors were very good about post-op pain management and I have several steps of pain relief available to me. One week post-op I moved off my prescribed narcotics during the day so that I'd be able to start driving again (which I was able to do for the first time on day 9 post-op). Between the hospital and at home my pain level has never gone higher than a 6, which is much lower than my usual menstrual pain levels. I don't know how much of this is because I've built up a stupid pain tolerance after decades of this disease and how much is the presacral neurectomy doing its job.

I am on a very limited diet at the moment, which is a combination of very soft foods and very low fiber foods. This basically means that I am eating like a picky toddler - white rice, tofu, most condiments (provided they are not spicy), peeled mashed potatoes, pancakes, pasta, and noodles. I am allowed one serving of canned fruit/day and basically no vegetables besides potatoes. I've found ways to be creative within these confines (and it helps that I have the best pancake recipe) but I am looking forward to the coming weeks when I can start incorporating regular foods.

So far pooping is weird and a bit nerve wracking (I am terrified of doing it wrong and hurting myself) but it's not as bad as I'd feared. One of my biggest fears was that I would never poop normally again. I still don't know if I will (it's very early in recovery after all), but the pain involved is much less than it was pre-surgery, so that's a win.

**Must haves, things I wish I'd known**

There are a few things that I am so glad I brought to the hospital or had on hand when I got home:

* Battery-powered LED lights -  I had read about pregnant ladies packing Christmas lights in their hospital bags. I decided to take it one step further and get a pack of battery-powered LED lights with a little remote control. All the nurses commented on them and I loved having some ambient light so I didn't have to turn on the bright overhead light. The color changing was also very relaxing.
* Peri bottle - someone here recommended a peri bottle and I could not be more grateful. I ended up not using mine at the hospital but I have been using it since I got home and it's great (I have a bidet but everything is a little tender down there so I appreciate having a gentler option to get clean, especially the first few days when twisting to wipe was a struggle).
* Pads - I bought some pads in advance (I'm team menstrual cup but nothing's allowed in there for six weeks) then forgot to bring them to the hospital. The pads they have at the hospital are the WORST. My husband ended up running to the store to grab some more when he couldn't find my at-home stash.
* Lip balm/chap stick - I'm not a big lip balm person, but the hospital was so dry and I was very glad to have lip balm.
* Tablet - I hadn't owned a tablet for years and waffled on whether to get one for the hospital stay, but was very grateful that I did. I watched a ton of TV and played games on it, and it was nice to have the big keyboard for texting when I was out of it. I'm still using it to watch TV in bed since coming home.
* Belly band - A friend who had  three c-sections recommended I get a postpartum belly band for recovery after coming home. Time will tell whether it helps with healing long-term, but wearing it has been great for keeping my core straight and preventing me from accidentally crunching or twisting or any of the other things I shouldn't be doing right now.
* Ice packs - I think it was day 3 post-op that a nurse first offered me an ice pack, and I wish that I'd been requesting them from the start. At home, I've been freezing water-filled surgical gloves, which make excellent ice packs (especially for perineal pain).

There are also a few things I wish I'd known:

* Not to beat a dead horse, but I wish I'd believed that everything would be okay. I built the whole thing up as being absolutely terrible, 11/10 pain, worst thing I'd ever go through in my life. It has been nowhere near as bad as I built it up to be, and I have been far more active and independent than I expected.
* Post-surgery bloating and inflammation is real and it's heavy. Despite not eating for six days and having a lot of tissue removed, when I came home I weighed myself and I was up 15lbs from my pre-surgery weight. No one had mentioned this, and when I had asked at the hospital why they had me clocking in well above my usual weight they shrugged. After I got home and saw the same number on my scale I called my surgeons, who said that it's a combination of water retention and inflammation and that it should go down (but could take a while). In the past few days I have lost about 7lbs of that excess weight.
* Swelling can be kind of random and unexpected. When the nurse was cleaning me up to put in the straight catheter she mentioned that everything looked very tender and swollen. I didn't know what she was talking about until I got home and saw that my right labia was about 3x the size of my left labia. I spoke with my surgeons who weren't sure why my right labia specifically would swell, but told me to ice it and let them know if it ever became blood-filled or otherwise terrifying (it didn't, and everything is back to normal now thank goodness).
* It's okay to be vulnerable and to ask for help. I have a big girl job where I'm often the only woman in the room. I am a proponent of servant leadership, so even though I have people who work for me I am constantly focused on whether they are doing okay, whether they have what they need to do their jobs, and whether they're getting enough downtime. This whole experience is teaching me that I should also be making sure that I'm okay and that admitting that I'm not doesn't make me weak. Almost everyone I have reached out to for help has been more than willing to provide. Friends have come by to keep me company, my family (with whom I've never been especially close) have been happy to chat and catch up, and my husband has been a rock. A rock who cries out, ""FOR GOD'S SAKE WOMAN, LIE DOWN AND LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU"" at least once a day, but a rock nonetheless.",8,1737095476.0,endometriosis,1,0.91,False

1i3ab9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepworkshops/comments/1i3ab9v/i_wrote_my_first_story_ever_and_i_want_to_make/,I wrote my first story ever and I want to make sure its as good as I think it is,"I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read ‚ÄúThe Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,‚Äù with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until‚Ä¶ silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could‚Äî

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

But more importantly I think baristas in this city are in a uniquely advantageous position to organize together and protect the historic coffee industry of the PNW. Owners profiteering in our community and draining it without supporting the workers that make those profits isn‚Äôt fair. They siphon out profits to their wealthy communities to pay for their vacations while we can‚Äôt even get the holiday off or take a sick day without threat of losing our jobs. 

Starbucks is weak and doesn‚Äôt represent the city anymore, there‚Äôs so few legacy shops left, the ones that are around are taking advantage of their employees, and the ones that used to take advantage of their employees all shut down or laid off their whole staff to find new ones. 

Baristas and coffee workers deserve better, and you do too. ",96,1737094804.0,Seattle,23,0.82,False
