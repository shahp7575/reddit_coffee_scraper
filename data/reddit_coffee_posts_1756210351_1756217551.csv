So today I went and got myself a trial shift at a well known chain coffee shop (I won‚Äôt name names). Yippee! Well done me. 

However. I may have slightly bent the truth regarding how much barista experience I have. I have worked behind bars for years and years, and a part of that was making coffees. I won‚Äôt pretend like I was amazing at latte art, but I know my way around a coffee machine. 

My question is (and plea for help): what are some basic tips and things I should know before starting this trial shift? Can I practice latte art somehow? What are some buzzwords I can fit in? Essentially, I want to wow them and get the job. Despite my (some would argue) lackluster barista experience. 

Thanks guys, I truly appreciate anything.

This didn't use to happen prior to this week. I'm concerned that I've had an organ fail and it's causing this reaction to either caffeine or the sugar added to the coffee.

[**AITA for telling people that I wasn't invited to a wedding?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xoxlp7/aita_for_telling_people_that_i_wasnt_invited_to_a/)

I've been working for my company for 7 years now, five of which have been spent on my current team. There are 15 people on it and I'd say we're all pretty close, relatively speaking. I have a coworker named Bob[33m], who joined the team when I did.

During the pandemic he announced to everyone on a Zoom meeting that he was now engaged.

Fast forward to this January and Bob says that his wedding would be held in September of this year at a really beautiful winery.

About five months ago the invites started coming in for everyone on the team, but mine didn't. I waited a few weeks but nothing came, so I went to Bob and asked if my invite got sent out. He gave me a solemn look and then told me that I wasn't invited because of a ""spacing issue"". He said he tried to make it work, but just couldn't, and hoped I didn't take it personally. He also said I'd be sure to get wedding favors and a piece of cake. He also asked me to keep it to myself and ""please not make a big deal out of it"". I honestly didn't know what to say, so I guess I just said ""okay"" and walked away.

I won't lie, I was upset. I hate feeling excluded, and it was doubly worse because everyone else on the team was going except for me. And honestly, I really like weddings, they're usually very fun. I kept it to myself, but I wasn't happy.

The day of the wedding came three weeks ago. and it went by without a hitch. Everyone on my team had a grand time and said it was beautiful The food and party was great as well and apparently everyone got a dozen fresh apple cider donuts to take home. I never did get that cake or wedding favors btw.

At work the following Monday my team member, Sherri, told me that everyone was confused as to where I was. Apparently Bob said I was sick and couldn't make it. I was confused and then pissed, I straight up told her I wasn't invited, and left it at that. She looked shocked, and asked me to confirm and I said yes I wasn't invited.

Well Sherri told someone, because about five people asked me if I wasn't invited and I said it was true.

Today was Bob's first day back from his honeymoon and it must have gotten back to him that I spilled the beans. He approached me in the break room and he was upset that I told Sherri and that it wasn't a big deal I missed the wedding. I said ""how would you like to be excluded from something everyone else is going to?""

We went back and forth for a bit, before Bob walked away. I was pretty upset, so upset that my project manager came to ask me if I was okay because she heard about me not being invited. I didn't want this to go this far, so I said yes. But other team members came up to me and said that Bob should have invited me, and it was wrong he didn't.

Look I realize that it was his wedding day and he's allowed to invite who he wants, but I'm allowed to be upset that I wasn't invited right?

So reddit, AITA for telling people I wasn't invited to the wedding and being upset about it?

**Edit:** Sorry I forgot to put in the OP that I'm a 30, male

**Edit 2:** Wow guys, thank you for all the support, my inbox is begging for mercy.

[**UPDATE: AITA for telling people that I wasn't invited to a wedding**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xr8xyv/update_aita_for_telling_people_that_i_wasnt/) 

I want to thank you all for the responses, especially for the wedding invites.

Well I have an update to this story and it took an interesting turn.

Bob and I were in the office today. He came to me and asked if we could talk. He asked if we could clear the air over some beers with his wife after work I said okay.

After work I meet Bob and his wife ""Pam"" in a bar. They both apologized for not inviting me, and making me feel excluded. Bob apologized for lying and getting mad about it.

The reason they didn't invite me is because they didn't want single guys at the wedding. They went to a big wedding back in 2019 that was ruined when a bunch of drunk, single guys started hitting on the women there. A few of the boyfriends and husbands got pissed and it turned into a big fight. People were arrested and it completely ruined the wedding.

I found it hard to believe, but they showed me a couple of Facebook videos of them at a wedding, and it looked the damn Royal Rumble going on. I was even shown a few Facebook statuses confirming their story. Pam said she was sort of traumatized by this and swore they'd have no single guys at their wedding.

Well the wedding came and Pam stuck to her guns. Only family, couples, single women or trusted single men were to be invited. Pam said that there were only about 10 single guys there, and they were all family members or groomsmen. She said the party turned out amazing this way since women didn't have to worry about being hit on.

Pam said it truly wasn't personal, and that she's so sorry for not inviting me, but would do it again. I asked if she and Bob didn't trust me enough to control myself. She said that Bob vouched hard for me, but she was sticking to her guns. The compromise was that she'd have to explain it if anyone asked, and that Bob got to choose the honeymoon destination.

Curiously she said that she had a sister around my age and I was ""just her type"" and she wanted to keep her away from me. I was a little offended at that, but she says that it's for my own good. Her sister is a little bit of sl*t(her words not mine) and she didn't want her to get her hooks in me(again her words).

Bob said he should have handled it better, and he wanted to be honest but it wouldn't have made much of a difference so he hoped I wouldn't mind as much. Plus he figured I wouldn't want to go to a wedding as a single guy anyway.

I told them I was kinda hurt, they thought I would act like a creeper at their wedding. Pam assured me that she thought I was a nice, smart, funny guy but she just wanted to make sure their wedding went off without a hitch.

They promised to make it up to me, but I told them it wasn't necessary. Pam insisted on it, and said I had to know how sorry she was.

So we made plans to have dinner at their expense at a very nice restaurant in the city this weekend.

So in the end I guess it wasn't anything I did, but I still feel kind of insulted. But I guess I get a free dinner out of it ü§∑üèª

**Edit:** There are a lot of comments here suggesting that I'm being naive, a doormat and letting them off easy for basically calling me a creep. I won't lie, I think you all might be right. I do believe in taking the high road on most occasions, but I don't think this should be one of those times. As a side note, I don't believe that wanting to see the best in people or taking them at their word makes you naive.

I had a call an hour ago with my project manager and explained the entire situation. She advised me to go to HR and make a complaint since it could lead to a hostile work environment. I have a meeting with them Monday. I don't really want to make a formal complaint, just have it on file in case anything happens. Tbh I don't think it will Bob doesn't seem like that kind of person, but I've been wrong plenty of times before.

So as per the advice here, I won't be going to dinner with Bob and Pam. I will however insist on a public apology that doesn't imply that I'm a creep. And I'm insisting on some fresh apple cider donuts, not store bought, but fresh.

Thank you for making me see the truth reddit. Although I'm dissapointed I'm turning down some wagyu steak, so you all owe me one haha.

**Final update:** I can't post any further updates on this sub, so I'll post updates on my profile.

**Update 2 - 4 days later (2 days later from the last post)**

[**Update and More Context**](https://www.reddit.com/user/weddinginvite69/comments/xt22j0/update_and_more_context/) 

Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by! I'm only allowed one update on AITA, and I can provide more detail with a self-post.

Unfortunately, there's an update to this story. Honestly, this whole thing is stupid as hell and I really just want to move on and forget this whole thing happened. But reality is often disappointing.

But first to clarify a few things:

1. I had to omit a lot of information because of character count in r/AmItheAsshole

2. I got a few posts and DM's asking why I felt entitled to be invited. I want to make it clear. I don't feel entitled to anything. Yes, I wanted to be invited, but as I said if they had been honest with me from the beginning I wouldn't have minded as much. They were allowed to do what they wanted on their wedding day. My problem was the subterfuge used to mask their choice.

3. I'm usually not this indecisive, but this is a weird situation and I don't exactly know how to handle it.

4. I have never talked to Bob about women, ever. We didn't have that kind of relationship, none of the men on the team do. I think the women do it among themselves, but I can't be sure about it.

5. I'm choosing to believe Pam about her experience dealing with men. If recent years have shown us anything, is that we need to believe women when they say they've been harassed or assaulted.

6. The ""trusted men '' were made up of family members and groomsmen who were explicitly told not to flirt with the women. Pam had to turn away some of her single guy friends, and Bob had a shit ton of guy friends who wanted to go but were turned away.

7. Bob and Pam's afterparty was going for a club vibe. Pam and some of her friends had very bad experiences being hit on at clubs and Pam wanted to ensure their safety. She got the idea to exclude guys from going to women only clubs. According to her, the vibe was so much better when women could ""get drunk and shake their asses and not be taken harassed by thirsty guys"". The women at the wedding appreciated the lack of guys on the dance floor, but some complained about the lack of guys at the wedding.

8. The wedding Royal Rumble happened at the wedding of one of her closest friends. The friend and her husband were devastated their wedding was ruined. It was so bad that they committed to having a five-year vow renewal. Also, they were stuck with a large cleanup bill from the venue for damages.

9. As for me, it was 70/30 on me being invited. It came down to that Pam didn't know me at all outside of my superb Super Mario Maker level design. Bob really fought hard for me, but Pam was too unsure, and then she remembered her sister.

10. According to Pam although she loves her sister to death, her sister is a huge sl*t and goes from guy to guy with the change of the wind. Apparently I'm dangerously her type and she would have been all over me. I asked what was wrong with that, she said her sister doesn't deserve a ""sweet guy like me"" and she didn't want her to get her hooks in me. This sealed my fate.

11. Bob said it would look horrible if I wasn't invited. That's when she came up with the compromise of taking the heat for it. He was just hoping that I wouldn't mind not going.

12. Maybe I'm naive, but I'm choosing to believe Bob about feeling horrible about not inviting me. He seemed really broken up about it, either he's a damn good actor or he's telling the truth.

13. He acknowledged that the way he handled it was terrible. According to him there was no way of doing this that wasn't awkward. As for why he lied? Apparently he panicked and couldn't think of anything better. Him getting mad at me for not going along with it wasn't necessarily about me, but being mad at Pam for putting him in that situation.

14. He promised to make a full apology in front of the team when we're all together in the office again in a few weeks.

15. Pam did say that she felt terrible about me and the other guys she had to exclude, but she would do it again to ensure the safety of the women around her.

16. She was extremely insistent on making it up to me. She said that we should be friends going forward and offered a nice home cooked meal to me followed by some wine and a round of Mario Kart. I turned that down. That's when the expensive restaurant solution was offered.

17. I accepted because it seemed like a fair compromise at the time. They didn't even have to really apologize for it, but they were offering me dinner so I took it. In hindsight I shouldn't have, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there and go home.

**Now for the update:**

After reading the comments calling me a doormat, I decided not to accept their dinner offer. I called Bob on his work phone to explain my change of heart. He was disappointed, but understood my reasoning. I parroted some of the talking points and he said he understood. He wouldn't make a big deal out of it, and we could just move on. I thanked him for being cool about it, and he hung up.

I thought that would be the end of it, but not five minutes later Bob calls me back. I groan and pick up; surprisingly, it was Pam on the other side.

She didn't come at me hostile, but she did sound upset. She wanted to know why I didn't want to come anymore. I explained what I told to Bob about how they basically insisted I was a creep. I told her I didn't want to invalidate her experiences, but I didn't have to accept being told I'm a potential sexual predator.

She said that she didn't mean it like that, and that she thinks I'm a good person, but couldn't risk it for her wedding. She was practically begging me to meet her in person to clear the air further. She kept on saying that we could be the best of friends if I'd give her a chance to explain better.

I said no thanks, and that I had to go, but I'm sorry that she went through what she went through. I ended the call by saying, ""btw I didn't even get those donuts"", I then hung up.

It's been quiet since then, but Bob is back in the office on Monday and I fear Pam might do something‚Ä¶. Drastic‚Ä¶

I hope this thing is over, but I fear it might not be. In any case I'll update if anything happens.

**Update 3 - 7 days later (3 days later from the last post)**

[**Bob's drunken confession update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/weddinginvite69/comments/xv9m14/bobs_drunken_confession_update/) 

Hey everyone!

So, as I mentioned in my last update, I reached out to Bob and explained that I wouldn‚Äôt be taking him and Pam up on their weekend dinner offer. He was disappointed but agreed with me. Pam called me back a few minutes later and fought hard to keep the plans. I declined and left it at that hoping that would be the end of it. It wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶..

And now, this silly drama continues.

I went in two hours early on Monday so that I could potentially avoid a Bob after-work chat. Surprisingly, Bob came in an hour early, lining him up to potentially leave with me. Bob looked exhausted. And I don‚Äôt mean tired; I mean mentally. I‚Äôve seen Bob tired; we've worked many late nights on projects together. I‚Äôve seen him hungover; this wasn‚Äôt any of that. I almost can‚Äôt describe it; he looked worn down. He shot me a ‚Äúsup‚Äù nod, and I gave him one back, and we got to work. 

I kept my meeting with HR. Our HR rep is a wonderful lady named ‚ÄúSally‚Äù. I told Sally the whole story, and she said that in her 15 years of HR work, she‚Äôs never heard a more stupid story. We shared a good laugh, and she told me that it would be unofficially logged just in case Bob or Pam did anything crazy. She told me she thinks Bob is harmless, but to keep my eyes sharp. The rest of the day was uneventful. The most interesting thing that happened was that I saw Bob‚Äôs face buried in his hands for a good minute or so.

With two hours to go, I go to the break room for some water. Bob follows me in and approaches cautiously. I gave him a surprised look, and he just threw up his hands as if to say he was not hostile. He said he knows I‚Äôm the last person I want to talk to right now, but he needs to talk to me. I said fine, but I angled us over to where the security camera was. Paraphrasing here, but he said, ‚ÄúLook, I won‚Äôt ever speak to you again if you don‚Äôt want me to, but let me buy you a round and explain all of the things Pam didn‚Äôt tell you when we met the other day.‚Äù Bob sounded desperate, something I‚Äôd never seen from him before. He then hit me with the money quote: ‚ÄúLook man, I could really use a friend right now, and I‚Äôve always considered you a friend.‚Äù

Well sorry to disappoint everyone here, but I‚Äôm a big gullible softie. I agreed to talk with him, but I told him that there would be absolutely no more ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù on this situation after this. He agreed and said he‚Äôd meet me after work.

After work, we walked to our usual bar, the same one I met him and Pam the first time. I suspected Pam might be there, but she wasn‚Äôt. Nevertheless, I kept my eye open for her. Once we sat down, Bob apologized yet again. This one seemed even more genuine than the first. I told him he didn‚Äôt need to keep apologizing; I got it the first time. He said that he had to apologize because there‚Äôs a lot more to the story about the wedding than I thought.

Bob explained that he fought Pam like hell to get her to give up the single men‚Äôs exclusion, but she was dead set on it. They argued for months, and a lot of people offered different solutions. Bob suggested a smaller wedding with only immediate family and friends, but Pam shot that down. She always dreamt of a big wedding with lots of people there, and a small wedding didn‚Äôt fit her dream. Her parents said, ‚Äúwhy not hire a security guard?‚Äù Pam said that she wanted the possibility eliminated completely. She said that a few single men could stand to not be invited to a party for once in their lives. 

Bob said he had a lot of friends who wanted to come and that they would be hurt if they weren‚Äôt invited. Pam said she was making sacrifices too; a lot of her guy friends wanted to come. Bob finally relented and said if the exclusion were to happen, he wanted nothing to do with that decision and wanted it known that it was out of his hands. Pam said she‚Äôd take the heat for it if it came to that, but didn‚Äôt think people would go crazy over it. She also gave Bob the choice of their honeymoon destination since he was making a big sacrifice. They went to the French Riviera if anyone is curious.

Bob said the wedding, reception, and party were amazing. He said that so many women there were drunk off their assess and falling over themselves. Apparently, they did feel safe, but a drunk vocal minority was complaining about the lack of ‚Äúhot guys to dance with‚Äù. Bob even laughed because one of them was going around calling it a ‚ÄúLesbian wedding‚Äù since there were only women there. Oh, and some women were absolutely hitting on the handful of single guys there, but Pam didn‚Äôt mind that as much.

Bob said he wasn‚Äôt rubbing it in, just setting up a point. After the honeymoon, they came home to what Bob described as a ‚ÄúPR firestorm‚Äù.

Apparently, Pam had lied to her guy friends about why they weren‚Äôt invited. One of her close friends let slip the real reason they weren‚Äôt invited. They were effing furious. She was flooded with angry calls and messages from her friends about Pam essentially calling them potential sexual predators. Pam explained her position multiple times to her friends, but it fell on deaf ears. She has lost MANY friends over this. One of the guys said, ‚Äúif you think that I‚Äôm a rapist then why the fuck are we even friends?‚Äù Pam has been crying for days, and her work life has become terrible; she might even need to leave her job.

By this point, Bob had a few hard drinks and was tipsy, so he let loose a little more.

He said that her decision had cost him friends of his own. So many of his guy friends were furious to learn they were excluded, and for the reason why. On the day of the wedding, about six or so of his closest friends who were excluded decided to go on a fishing trip as a ‚Äúscrew you‚Äù to Bob and Pam. The cherry on top of the petty cake? They decide to donate $500 and some items to a local woman‚Äôs shelter. 

Bob was devastated, and none of those guys are returning his calls or messages. Even their families are upset with them over the exclusion. Pam‚Äôs parents are publicly supportive, but chastise her behind the scenes. She doesn‚Äôt have anyone but her bridesmaids and about three other friends who believe in her cause. Bob said at one point that Pam was hysterical and screaming ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt anyone just understand my point of view?!‚Äù.

I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing, but there was more to this crazy story. At this point, we were about an hour in and Bob was nice and tipsy. So, I pried for more information.

Bob said that at first, Pam was sticking to her guns that the exclusion was a good idea, but she was starting to waiver a little bit. She said that most people understood where she was coming from, but that it was too heavy-handed, and even a little sexist. Bob and Pam have had multiple blowups over this whole situation, and they‚Äôre not in a good place right now. He said that instead of feeling giddy about his new wife and basking in the glow of being married, he‚Äôs harboring a ton of resentment towards her because she‚Äôs cost him a lot of his friends and ruined their lives over a stupid party.

As for me?

Apparently, Pam really likes me. One of her biggest regrets about this entire situation is not getting to know me better before the wedding. He said, that Pam thinks I‚Äôm one of the coolest people she‚Äôs ever met. I asked Bob how she made that determination from a 15-minute chat, and he laughed and said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know man, she probably has a crush on your or something.‚Äù I laughed, but that made the situation a little bit weird.

As for Pam‚Äôs sister?

She is a sl*t, but not in the way you may think. Bob explained that Pam‚Äôs sister ‚ÄúBeth‚Äù is by all accounts a very smart, successful, respectful woman. She just so happens to like sex. Bob explained that Beth is really into the kink scene and is into things like ethical non-monogamy. She frequently mentions her adventures to Bob and Pam, and it got them into the lifestyle as well. I was a little surprised, and I asked for clarification, and he said ‚Äúyeah, she kind of got us into some of that stuff.‚Äù I was shocked, I mean how often do you hear that your co-worker is into BDSM? But hey, no kink-shaming from me.

So, it turns out that Beth isn‚Äôt some soul-sucking, homewrecking, out-of-control succubus, she‚Äôs just a regular woman who loves sex. Bob said that Pam was scared that we would hit it off. We share many of the same interests and have similar personality types according to Bob, Pam wasn‚Äôt lying about that, nor that I was exactly her type. She likes tall guys, and from what I‚Äôve heard, she‚Äôd have been all over me if she found out I was single. 

Well, now I was curious, so I asked Bob if he had a picture. He pulled up her Instagram, and I must say she was damn gorgeous. She looked like Pam‚Äôs twin, only she was a little bit thicker. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I was pretty pissed at Pam all over again lol. Bob said that Pam has always been a little jealous of Beth. I don‚Äôt know why, Pam is a stunner herself, and looks just like Beth. Bob said that as a FU to Pam, he‚Äôd give her my Insta so we can DM each other, and he‚Äôd put in a good word for me. I thanked him profusely lol.

He said that Pam was so desperate to make amends with me because I made a big impression on her, and she thinks that we‚Äôd be really good friends if we hung out. Bob said that she was just grasping at straws at this point. She‚Äôs lost all of her friends, and she wanted to make another one. He said that he‚Äôd reign Pam in so that she wouldn‚Äôt bother me anymore.

By this point, Bob is more than tipsy. He says that he‚Äôs having doubts about this marriage because the wedding process and aftermath have been a nightmare. He thinks it‚Äôd be really shallow to divorce her over this, but his life has been ruined by her choices. I was shocked, and he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell Pam please‚Äù. I swore that I wouldn‚Äôt tell her anything.

Bob paid for our drinks, and he was gonna take public transportation home, but I told him he needs an Uber. He fought me on that, but I insisted and he agreed to take one. I put him in the Uber and sent him on his way. An hour later, Pam texted me from his work phone. She told me: ‚Äúthank you for taking care of my hubby, you‚Äôre a good person.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond.

And that brings us to now. I hope that this is mostly the end of it, but it seems like Pam might be desperate and do something rash. In any case, I‚Äôll keep you fine folks updated.

**Update 4 - 16 days later (9 days later from the last post)**

[**New update: A date with Beth**](https://www.reddit.com/user/weddinginvite69/comments/y2rrkk/new_update_a_date_with_beth/) 

Hey everyone, nothing major has happened, but I have a small update.

Bob was true to his word and gave Beth my Instagram. She messaged me last week and we got to talking. The conversation went so well that we agreed on a coffee date this past weekend.

Well, sorry to disappoint the naysayers here, but the date went extremely well. We talked about a lot: our hobbies, interests, futures, jobs, and families. Bob was right, we are remarkably similar, even down to some of our specific food tastes. The date went so well that we met at a bar next to her office for some after-work drinks. And yes, that date went amazing as well.

Now here's the part I think you're all going to like. We're going to do a hike this coming weekend, and along the way, we're going to make a stop at the winery where Bob and Pam had their wedding and pick me up some GODDAMN APPLE CIDER DONUTS.

I think if all goes well with this date, I'm going to ask her to be my girlfriend, she just feels special.

So that's it. I'll let you know how that hike date goes, but honestly, I think this situation is mostly settled now. Bob has been keeping his distance, but hooked me up, and Pam hasn't been in contact with me for a week now. After the hike, it'll probably be my last post. I don't intend on milking this thing for unnecessary drama.

Thanks all

**Final Update- 21 days later (6 days later from the last post)**

[**Update IV: The Final Chapter?**](https://www.reddit.com/user/weddinginvite69/comments/y6nt3i/update_iv_the_final_chapter/) 

Hey all

I want to thank you all for sticking with me through this crazy ass saga. And also for the congratulations for getting with Beth. It means a lot.

Now on to the update.

As I mentioned last time, me and Beth had met and had gone on a few dates. She's truly an amazing woman. She's smart, funny, driven and very nice. I'm absolutely smitten with this girl lol. Well, we had a hike this past Saturday and it was beyond amazing. The weather was perfect, the foliage was beautiful, and the view from the top of the mountain was amazing.

We had a picnic at the top of the mountain, and during a lull in the conversation, I summoned all of my courage and asked her if she'd like to be my girlfriend. I was waiting for a more opportune time, but I guess I just got swept up in the moment and view. She smiled, laughed and said I was the corniest person alive for asking in such a clich√© place, but she said that she loved corny and clich√©. She said yes, and we sealed it with a kiss.

On our way back, we finally stopped by the winery where Bob and Pam had their wedding and man it really was beautiful. It had panoramic views of the mountains, and the vineyard was very pretty. But I wasn't here for the view, I was here for some GODDAMN APPLE CIDER DONUTS.

Funny enough, we got there kinda late and almost missed the fresh donuts for the day. Thankfully we got some of the last batches. God those donuts were absolutely delicious. We got two dozen each and and even got some apple filling cider donuts. The wait was worth it.

Afterward we went back to her apartment and made dinner together. I've never had such an amazing date with a woman. It was just perfect. I didn't want to leave, but I couldn't be presumptuous. When I picked up my keys to go, she grabbed them from me and said and I quote: ""if you seriously think you're leaving, then you're out of your fucking mind"". I must have had the biggest smile on my face.

So we spent the rest of the weekend together. We had a wonderful Sunday brunch, and a nice walk around our city holding hands going into stores and sightseeing. Unfortunately for me, we had to part last night because we had work in the morning. I was damn near in tears lol. This is going to sound dramatic as hell, but I've spent the last few hours at work being totally miserable that I'm not with Beth. It's like when you're in high school and you get your first boyfriend/girlfriend and you can't stand to be apart from each other.

But you don't want sappy love stories, you're here for the drama. Well, me and Beth made it Instagram official on Sunday, and apparently Pam saw it on her sister's profile. She texted Beth on Sunday night, ""how do you know OP?"" She said, ""Bob introduced us"". Pam only replied with, ""I knew this would happen"". We figured that might mean trouble down the road, but we don't care, Pam can be as mad as she wants.

This morning, I actually went up to Bob and thanked him for introducing me to Beth. He explained that he and Pam had a huge fight over him introducing us. He said he didn't care about it though, it was worth it just to get us together and was a ""big FU"" to Pam. I told him I'd buy him a round as a thank you, but he said don't worry about it, and that it was the least he could do.

So that's it for this update. I'd like to hope that this is the end, but Pam seems pretty upset with us being together. Either way, I'm just so happy with Beth, she's a once in a lifetime kind of person. And rest assured I'll update if anything further happens.

Peace and love.

That‚Äôs why my favorite Pixel 10 case for work isn‚Äôt just about protection, it‚Äôs about practicality.

The case I use is a third party option with a built in kickstand. It lets me prop up my phone during Zoom calls or when I need to reference documents while typing on my laptop. The material is sturdy enough to survive the occasional drop, but slim enough to slide easily into my pocket or a laptop sleeve.

What I really like is the balance, it doesn‚Äôt feel bulky, yet it adds a layer of durability that the official cases never gave me. Plus, the design looks professional without being boring. It matches well in both office and coffee shop settings.

what's up everyone. so you're thinking about starting a business in dallas? good call. this city is blowing up right now and there are tons of opportunities if you know where to look. but honestly, coming up with a good idea is the hardest part. so i put together a list of some ideas i think could actually work here. and not just the same old stuff you always hear. hope this helps someone out.  
  
1. High-Tech Kids' Play Cafe. bet you didn't think of this one. with so many young families moving to dallas, there's a huge demand for places to take the little ones. but instead of another boring soft-play gym, picture this: a cafe with amazing local coffee for the parents and a high-tech, interactive play area for the kids. think augmented reality games, coding stations for kids, and creative workshops. it's a way more engaging experience for the kids and a much cooler place for parents to hang out. startup costs would be in the medium range, probably $50k-$100k to get a good space and the right tech. but the potential is huge, especially in neighborhoods like plano or frisco.  
  
2. Prked - Your Parking Spot Side Hustle. okay, hear me out on this one because it's a pretty solid opportunity for some passive income. Prked is a business where you rent out your unused parking space. think about it, dallas is packed and parking is a nightmare, especially around downtown, deep ellum, and the bishop arts district. if you have a driveway, a garage spot, or even a patch of yard you're not using, you can rent it out on the prked app. you can do short-term rentals for people going to concerts or games, or you can do monthly rentals for people who live or work in your area and need a regular spot. tons of people need monthly parking. the best part is the startup cost is basically zero. you're just using what you already have. this is a no-brainer for making some extra cash in dallas.  
  
3. Luxury Pet Services. people in dallas love their pets. and i'm not just talking about a walk in the park. i'm talking about high-end, luxury services for their furry friends. think doga (dog yoga), pet-friendly food trucks with gourmet treats, a spa day for your pup, or even a pet photography studio with different themed backdrops. the market for this is bigger than you'd think, especially in the wealthier neighborhoods. you could start small with a mobile service to keep costs down, maybe in the $10k-$20k range for a good van and equipment.  
  
4. Pop-Up Art Gallery/Event Space. dallas has a really cool art scene, but it can be hard for new artists to get their work seen. a pop-up gallery that moves to different neighborhoods each month could be a huge hit. you could feature local artists, host workshops, and even rent out the space for private events. the key is to make it an experience, not just a stuffy gallery. think music, drinks, and a cool vibe. startup costs would depend on the rent for the pop-up spaces, but you could probably get started for around $20k-$30k.  
  
5. Personalized Meal Kit Delivery for Niche Diets. sure, there are the big meal kit companies, but what about a local service that caters to specific dietary needs? think keto, vegan, gluten-free, or even meals tailored to athletes. dallas is a very health-conscious city, and people are willing to pay for convenience. you could partner with local farms to source fresh ingredients and build a really loyal customer base. you'd need a commercial kitchen space, so startup costs would be in the $30k-$50k range.  
  
6. Smart Home Installation and Consulting. with all the new construction and people moving to dallas, there's a huge demand for smart home technology. but not everyone is tech-savvy enough to install it themselves. a business that specializes in smart home installation and consulting could do really well. you could help people choose the right products, install everything, and even offer ongoing support. startup costs are relatively low, probably under $10k for tools and marketing.  
  
7. Mobile Cocktail Bar. dallas has a great nightlife scene, but sometimes you want the party to come to you. a mobile cocktail bar is a super fun and unique business idea. you could cater weddings, corporate events, and private parties. get a cool vintage trailer, deck it out, and you're good to go. the biggest expense would be the trailer and the liquor license, so you're probably looking at a startup cost of around $40k-$60k.  
  
8. Corporate Wellness Programs. with so many big companies headquartered in dallas, there's a big market for corporate wellness programs. these companies want to keep their employees happy and healthy. you could offer on-site yoga classes, meditation workshops, nutrition counseling, and even financial wellness seminars. you could start this business with very little overhead, maybe just a few thousand dollars for a website and some marketing materials.  
  
9. Subscription Box for Local Dallas Goods. people in dallas are proud of their city and love to support local businesses. a subscription box that features a curated selection of dallas-made products would be a huge hit. you could include things like local coffee, snacks, art, and home goods. it's a great way to discover new local brands and it makes a perfect gift. startup costs would be in the $10k-$15k range to source the products and build a website.  
  
10. Food Truck, but with a Twist. okay, i know i said i'd avoid the obvious ones, but food trucks are still a great business in dallas. the key is to have a unique concept. don't just do another taco or burger truck. think about a niche. maybe a dessert truck that only sells gourmet donuts and coffee, or a truck that specializes in healthy, plant-based meals. the food truck itself will be your biggest expense, probably around $50k-$80k, but the potential to make a lot of money is definitely there.  
  
so there you have it. a few ideas to get you started. honestly, the best business idea is one that you're passionate about. so take these ideas as a starting point and make them your own. good luck out there. i'm rooting for you.",1,1756216592.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

1n0mjjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1n0mjjz/should_you_choose_the_best_wireless_headset/,Should You Choose the Best Wireless Headset Logitech Zone Wireless 2,"Putting the Logitech 981-001435 Zone Wireless 2 headset to test in my daily routine was genuinely insightful. This premium noise-canceling device had me diving into a world of crystal-clear audio clarity. I spent consecutive workdays wearing it during long meetings, deep-focus tasks, and even during my occasional music breaks. While the product comes with high expectations, there‚Äôs a mix of applaud-worthy features and a few pain points worth discussing.

**Sleek Design and Impressive Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this headset was its modern yet minimalist design. Its graphite finish has an elegant vibe and perfectly blends into both professional and casual setups. The adjustable headband feels sturdy without being heavy, and at just 8.1 ounces, it‚Äôs light enough for all-day use. Earpads, made with comfortable material, rest gently around the ears, offering just the right balance of snugness and breathability. And those interchangeable ear cushions? Absolute lifesavers for long use and cleanliness. Plus, its use of 20% post-consumer recycled plastic makes it a sustainably inclined choice, which felt like a bonus point in a world leaning toward eco-conscious products.

**Advanced Call Clarity for Professional Needs**  
Equipped with four noise-canceling microphones, the headset makes a solid companion for video calls. In my tests, background interruptions like co-workers' chatter or coffee shop buzz were hardly noticeable. The claim of suppressing ambient noises using the Logi Tune app? Spot on. Calls felt seamless as others could focus on my voice without the audio chaos usually associated with the office environment.

**[Check Logitech 981-001435 price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0ddfc2418/)**

**Noise Cancellation and Personal Audio Modes**  
Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) yet? This feature is versatile and easy to tweak. During busier office hours, setting ANC on high or transparency mode was a revelation‚Äîit tuned out unnecessary distractions but allowed me to stay connected with my surroundings. On quieter days, I toggled ANC off and still enjoyed uninterrupted sound quality. Whether for meetings, music, or podcasts, the 40mm dynamic drivers produced audio that felt both rich and immersive. The customizable EQ feature in the Logi Tune app was also a game-changer‚Äîit allowed me to personalize sound to my liking. 

**Battery Life and Connectivity**  
Battery life did not disappoint. I was genuinely amazed that it lasted through my 9-6 work schedule and even survived late-night binge-watching sessions with battery to spare. Logitech promises up to 22 hours of listening time with ANC on, and in my use, this claim felt entirely realistic. On top of that, its Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity held up perfectly within its 50-meter range‚Äîno drops, just uninterrupted freedom to pace around while multitasking. The added functionality to connect two devices simultaneously? It turned into an instant favorite, as I could seamlessly switch between my laptop for meetings and my phone for calls.

**Winning Points**  
- Sleek and lightweight design for extended wear  
- Impressive call clarity backed by noise-canceling microphones  
- Versatile ANC modes tailored for varying environments  
- Long-lasting battery life with fast recharging  
- Eco-conscious materials and replaceable components  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The provided Logi Tune app interface could feel more user-friendly  
- Slightly pricey for casual users who might not leverage all its features  
- The headband might be less accommodating for larger head sizes  
- Exchangeable ear cushions feel loose upon repeated swaps  

**Competitive Options**  
In testing against competing brands like the Bose 700 or Sony WH-1000XM5, this Logitech headset confidently held its ground. The Bose model, known for its unmatched ANC, still owns the high ground in pure noise-blocking capabilities, but the ease of multi-device connectivity on the Zone Wireless 2 tips the favor for those juggling between devices. Meanwhile, Sony‚Äôs comparable model offers a more tailored music experience yet lacks the seamless Microsoft Teams certification that this headset brings to professionals. Logitech‚Äôs eco-conscious build is another bonus neither competitor extensively markets, giving it an edge in responsible sourcing.

**Affordable Quality**  
While the price doesn't cater to budget users, the rich feature set justifies it for professionals or power users. This isn't your casual weekend gaming headset; it‚Äôs built for those who rely on clear communication and premium audio to get through demanding work hours. Given all its certifications, extended battery life, and multitasking prowess, it offers the kind of quality that feels worth the price tag when evaluated against its peers.

1n0mgch,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n0mgch/does_waterdrop_wdg3cf_replacement_filter_deliver/,Does Waterdrop WD-G3-CF Replacement Filter Deliver on Performance? A Comprehensive Review,"The Waterdrop WD-G3-N1CF filter quickly became my go-to filter for daily water purification needs‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot to admire but also a few quirks worth sharing. It‚Äôs specifically designed as a replacement for the Waterdrop G3, G3P600, and G3P800 reverse osmosis systems, which means it‚Äôs tailored for users with these under-sink systems. Over the past few weeks of testing this, I‚Äôve put it through its paces to figure out if it truly delivers clean, great-tasting water without compromise.

**Design and Build Quality**

I was impressed with the sleek, minimalist design of this water filter. It‚Äôs compact at 3.3 inches in diameter and just over 12 inches tall, making it a great fit under the sink without taking up too much room. The lightweight construction, at just 789 grams, makes it easy to handle, which turned out to be a blessing during installations. Its white exterior blends seamlessly with most under-sink setups, and surprisingly, it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. The use of coconut shell activated carbon as the primary filtration material ensures a more eco-friendly design, which I appreciate a lot.

Before diving into its performance, check out this link for more details:  
[See Waterdrop WD-G3-N1CF deals on Amazon now.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07nzssbwc/)

**Ease of Installation**

Swapping out the filter was ridiculously simple. There‚Äôs no need for tools, just a quick twist, and it was locked securely into place. I timed this, and it honestly took under thirty seconds, which was faster than I expected. If you‚Äôre someone who dreads dealing with complicated installations (I certainly do), this will save you a lot of time and frustration. However, do note that you‚Äôll want to make sure the existing setup aligns with this filter‚Äôs compatibility list. It‚Äôs designed specifically for Waterdrop systems, so users of other brands or models may face disappointment if they assume it‚Äôs universal.

**Performance and Filtration**

From the moment I had this installed, the water quality noticeably improved. It uses a 3-in-1 filtration system that removes impurities like sand, rust, and suspended solids while also enhancing the taste. After testing the water with a simple home TDS meter, I noticed the filter substantially reduced dissolved solids, bringing them down to ideal drinking levels. My black coffee even tasted better‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt expect such a stark difference! The coconut shell-activated carbon is particularly effective at removing chlorine odors and organic substances, which is fantastic.

That said, I noticed a slight lag in water flow rate compared to its brand-new predecessor. While not a dealbreaker, you certainly won‚Äôt be filling massive water jugs in record time. Though Waterdrop claims each filter lasts six months or 550 gallons, my household started to notice flavor differences around the five-month mark. Heavy usage families may need to replace it a bit sooner than advertised.

**Advantages**

- Swift, tool-free installation process  
- Impressive 3-in-1 filtration, delivering improved water quality and taste  
- Eco-friendly coconut shell material in the carbon block  
- Small, lightweight build perfect for compact spaces  

**Negatives**

- Minor reduction in water flow compared to newer filters  
- May not last the full six months under heavy use  
- Limited compatibility with Waterdrop systems only  

**Product Rivals**

While this filter performed well, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it with similar offerings like the APEC Water Systems replacement filter and the iSpring under-sink filters. The APEC filter delivers comparable water quality, but the installation process is trickier and frequently involves tools. iSpring‚Äôs filters, on the other hand, boast slightly better longevity, sometimes stretching beyond six months. However, I‚Äôve found the Waterdrop filter superior in eco-friendliness due to its coconut shell carbon block and ease of installation. For someone wanting convenience without sacrificing quality, this one edges out its competitors.

**Value Assessment**

This filter strikes a decent balance between quality and price. It‚Äôs not the cheapest replacement out there, but it rewards you with improved water taste, quick installation, and reasonable longevity. Budget-conscious buyers might second-guess its cost at first sight, but I‚Äôd argue the minimal hassle and reliable filtration are worth the splurge. You could spend slightly less on a competing product, but you run the risk of dealing with frustrating installations or compromised filtration technology. You‚Äôll be happy you stuck to what works.

1n0megr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0megr,Copenhagen coffee trip report,"Hello,  
we have been very recently to Copenhagen, Denmark with my significant other, mainly to get some well deserved rest and second big reason was to visit our favourite roasters in person as we both love coffee.  
First thing that struck us was how calm and peaceful the city was, hardly any car traffic, everyone using bike to commute and everyone so helpful and smiling - I think I am starting to understand what Danish people mean by the word ""hygge"" and I believe this nature translates very well into how they roast and like their coffee - delicate and bright, no extreme overprocessed coffees or tastes.  
Also it was very hard to find a street where there would not be at least one caf√© on each side, that is how many of the caf√©s there are and a lot of them roast their own coffee. So here is just a couple of remarks from our visit:

# Day 1

**Coffee Collective**

Our first steps led to Coffee Collective at Bernikow Garden. The caf√© is very cosy, with lovely and peaceful place to sit below the tree branches hanging down.  
We had both filter, first one was out of washed Kenya Kieni which I would describe as classic Kenyan profile - black currant with other stone fruit like plums, second one was natural Ethiopia Reshad - very intense sweet, tasted really like semidried apples, with slight hints of citrus aroma.  
Overall I enjoyed the Ethiopia (because I generally enjoy them the most) but also because I would probably nitpick an issue with Kieni being slightly overextracted and the aftertaste was a little bitter.

**April Coffee**

Our second visit was just a little later just around the corner in April Coffee. The place itself is very minimalistic, almost reminds of a laboratory. They have the coffee already pre-grinded in the smaller batches (visible on some photo).  
We also both had a filtered coffee - first one was washed Costa Rica Volcan Azul from their sustainable profile coffees - tasted like chocolate at first and delicate stone fruit, the chocolate flavour was less noticeable after it cooled down, second was out of washed Colombia El Tosoro - it was not so sweet, again delicate fruit, after it cooled down a bit it was very noticeable smelling and testing like honey.  
I would say I enjoyed the second one more also because the first one was probably medium roasted hence why it had more chocolatey notes.

# Day 2

**La Cabra**

On our second day we visited La Cabra, again this roaster or caf√© is just around the corner, all these 3 caf√©s I have mentioned can be found in a single street block. The place inside is very small so most people are sitting outside where they could.  
We had a filtered coffee out of anaerobic Ethiopia Mofa which was very delicate, probably most tea like out of all the filtered coffees we had in Copenhagen, tasted like stone fruits (I would say plums mostly), very delicate fermentation. Then we had an espresso out of anaerobic Ecuador Hacienda La Papaya fermented in oak barrels - this was taste wise exactly how I like espressos - very forward fruity and juicy, almost tropical flavours.

**April Coffee**

We have originally wanted to visit Prolog coffee but that is slightly out of the town centre so we went to April again, this time we wanted to tasted their espressos.  
We both had espresso out of natural Ethiopia Regassa - and this was a completely different experience than La Cabra espresso - I would describe it as an espresso with qualities of a filtered coffee, very delicate, tea like but with pleasant acidity typical for espresso cups. Very unique and my girlfriend said that it was the best espresso she had so far.

# Day 3

**Original Coffee**

On our day 3 we have been already leaving so we just visited this caf√©, they roast their own coffees too - we had espresso out of washed Peru Estrella Divina - it did not really taste that good, mainly because of the acidity which almost felt like artificial. Also the roast I would say was darker so there were popping chocolate notes but not very flavourful.

**Some other remarks** \- I could not speak for Coffee Collective but in other caf√©s the filtered coffees were prepared using switch or in case of April with their April hybrid brewer (which is a flat bed switch). Also it is interesting that plain water does not taste the same in all caf√©s even when they are across the street, Coffee Collective and La Cabra tasted sweet, while April had no taste of sweetness in it and instead it was almost bitter (maybe they change TDS of the water they use? I did not really look into it).",11,1756216219.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I've been looking everywhere....,"It was Nathaniel's birthday. Harrison had spent all morning preparing his favorite dishes. That's when his phone buzzed on the kitchen counter.
Ding!
He'd forgotten it at home.
Harrison unlocked the screen to see a message from the student.
[I scraped my knee carrying your cake. It really hurts.]
Attached was a suggestive photo - not of the sender's face, but of her thighs. The girl wore thigh-high white stockings with black Mary Janes and a plaid skirt hiked up to reveal toned legs. A fresh bruise bloomed on her porcelain skin. The youthful image paired with the coy message screamed calculated seduction.
Powerful men like Nathaniel always fell for this type.
Harrison's grip tightened until her knuckles turned white.
Ding!
Another message arrived.
""Mr. Falcon, see you at Silver Pines tonight! Let me make your birthday unforgettable.""
So his mistress planned to celebrate with him.
Harrison grabbed her purse and drove straight to Silver Pines Hotel. She needed to see this girl's face.
As she approached the entrance, she froze. Her parents Theodore and Victoria stood near the valet. Heart pounding, she approached them.
""Father? Mother? What are you doing here?""
The couple exchanged nervous glances before Theodore cleared his throat.
""Harrison... Isabella returned today. We're welcoming her back.""

Isabella?
Through the hotel's glass facade, Harrison spotted her sister - wearing the exact same plaid skirt from Nathaniel's phone. The mistress was her own flesh and blood.
Isabella had always been stunning, dubbed Willowbrook's ""Crimson Rose,"" famous for her dancer's legs. Countless men had fallen for her charms. Now her perfect sister was using those very assets to steal her husband.
Harrison let out a bitter laugh. ""I suppose I'm the last to know?""
Theodore gave an uncomfortable smile. ""Harrison, Mr. Falcon never wanted you.""
""Exactly,"" Victoria added. ""Every woman in Willowbrook wants Nathaniel Falcon. Better our Isabella than some stranger.""
Harrison's nails dug into her palms. ""I'm your daughter too!""
She turned sharply, heels clicking against pavement.
Victoria called after her. ""Harrison! Tell me - has Nathaniel ever touched you?"" Harrison stopped dead.
Theodore's voice turned cold. ""Don't act the victim. Three years ago when Nathaniel and Isabella were Willowbrook's golden couple, everyone expected their engagement. Then the accident left him comatose. You were just the placeholder.""
Victoria's gaze swept over Harrison's simple dress. ""Look at you - a frumpy housewife while Isabella became principal dancer at the National Ballet. She's the swan, you're the duckling. What could you possibly offer him? Just give him back.""
Each word stabbed deeper. Blinking back tears, Harrison fled.
Night had fallen when she returned to Rosewood Manor. She'd dismissed the staff, leaving the mansion dark and hollow.
She sat alone at the dining table.
The food had gone cold. The cake she'd decorated read ""Happy Birthday My Love"" in perfect script.
The irony burned - her entire existence was a joke.
Nathaniel and Isabella had been Willowbrook's darlings, with Isabella as his treasured ""Crimson Rose."" Then the accident left Nathaniel vegetative and Isabella vanished abroad.
That's when the Whitmores dragged Harrison from the countryside to take Isabella's place. She'd agreed eagerly - she'd loved Nathaniel since childhood.
For three years, she'd devoted herself to his care, abandoning her own life to nurse him. Her efforts paid off - Nathaniel woke.
Harrison lit the birthday candles.
Their glow reflected in the mirror - a plain woman in a shapeless dress, no sparkle left.
Meanwhile, Isabella remained radiant - a prima ballerina in her prime.
Harrison was the duckling. Isabella the swan.
Now awake, Nathaniel returned to his true love.
A hollow laugh escaped her. This wasn't love - it was delusion. Nathaniel had never wanted her, yet she'd given everything. The first to love always loses.
Today, Nathaniel destroyed her completely.
Tears fell as she blew out the candles, plunging the mansion into darkness.
Suddenly, headlights cut through the night. Nathaniel's Rolls-Royce purred up the drive.
Harrison's breath caught. She hadn't expected him home tonight.
The door opened, Nathaniel bringing the night's chill with him.
Nathaniel Falcon - heir to Falcon Enterprises. A business prodigy who'd earned dual masters from Westfield by sixteen. He'd taken the company public in Willow Heights, becoming Willowbrook's wealthiest man before thirty.
""Why are you sitting in the dark?"" His baritone voice filled the space as lights flickered on.
Harrison blinked against the sudden brightness. When her vision cleared, she took him in - the impeccably tailored suit, the aristocratic bearing that haunted society women's dreams.
""It's your birthday.""
Nathaniel's handsome face remained impassive as he glanced at the table. ""I've told you not to bother with this.""
""Or is it just me you don't want celebrating with you?"" Harrison challenged.
His cold gaze flickered over her. ""Believe what you like.""
He turned toward the stairs.
Always so distant. Nothing could melt that icy exterior.
Harrison stood abruptly. ""I have a gift for you.""
Nathaniel didn't pause. ""I don't want it.""
A sad smile touched her lips. ""Nathaniel... I want a divorce.""
He froze mid-step, slowly turning. His dark eyes locked onto hers with startling intensity.
Chapter 2
Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze without flinching. Her voice carried quiet determination as she repeated, ""I want a divorce, Nathaniel. Did you enjoy your birthday present?""
Nathaniel didn't react. ""You're ending our marriage because I missed my birthday dinner?""
""Isabella's back, isn't she?""
At the mention of Isabella, Nathaniel's lips twisted into a sardonic smile. He closed the distance between them in one stride. ""Jealous?""

The youngest billionaire in Willowbrook radiated power with every movement. Harrison instinctively retreated until her back hit the cold wall.
Nathaniel caged her in, one hand planted beside her head. His muscular frame blocked all escape.
His piercing eyes bored into hers. ""The entire city knows Isabella was my choice. You schemed your way into this marriage when she left. Why the sudden conscience?""
Harrison's face paled.
Yes, Nathaniel had loved Isabella. Without that accident putting him in a coma, she'd never have become Mrs. Falcon.
She'd never forget the icy disappointment in his eyes when he woke and found her by his bedside.
Separate bedrooms. No intimacy.
He loved Isabella.
She'd always known this, but...
Harrison studied Nathaniel's face, superimposing the man before her with the boy from her memories.
'Nathaniel, do you really not remember me?'
She'd been waiting for someone who no longer existed.
Enough.
Three years of one-sided devotion.
Suppressing the ache in her chest, Harrison whispered, ""Let's end this farce of a marriage.""
Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. ""Farce?""
He seized her chin, thumb brushing her lower lip. ""Is that what this is about? You're frustrated?"" His voice dropped to a husky murmur. ""Need me that badly?""
Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks.
That wasn't what she meant!
Yet Nathaniel kept tracing her mouth with shocking intimacy. The usually composed billionaire had a wicked side.

He was seeing Harrison properly for the first time. Normally hidden behind oversized glasses and drab outfits, now he noticed her delicate features, the striking eyes behind those lenses.
Her lips were impossibly soft. Tempting.
A dangerous thought surfaced.
Nathaniel's gaze darkened. ""Who knew my proper wife was so desperate?""
Slap!
Harrison's palm connected with his cheek. Nathaniel's head snapped sideways.
Her hand trembled. Love shouldn't require sacrificing dignity. He'd crossed a line.
""I know you never stopped loving Isabella,"" she spat. ""Fine. You can have your precious Mrs. Falcon title back!""
Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. No one had ever struck him.
His voice dripped venom. ""You married me when it suited you. Now you'll divorce on a whim? What am I to you?""
Harrison laughed bitterly. ""A trophy.""
""What?""
""A prize I stole from Isabella."" She forced the words out, ignoring the pain. ""I'm bored now. Time to discard you.""
Nathaniel's face darkened. ""Fine! Don't come crawling back!""
He stormed upstairs, the study door slamming shut.
Harrison slid down the wall, hugging her knees. 'Nathaniel, I'm done loving you.'
Next morning, Beatrice entered the study.
Nathaniel was reviewing documents, the notorious workaholic.
""Sir?"" Beatrice approached cautiously.
He didn't look up. The air around him was frigid.
She set down a coffee. ""Mrs. Falcon made this.""
Nathaniel's pen stilled. The coffee he liked. Was this her apology?
Truthfully, Harrison was an impeccable wife‚Äîexcellent cook, meticulous homemaker.
He took a sip. Perfect, as always.
But no. She'd slapped him. A coffee wouldn't suffice.
""Did she apologize?"" Nathaniel demanded.
Beatrice hesitated. ""Sir... Mrs. Falcon left.""
Nathaniel froze.
She handed him a document. ""She asked me to give you this.""
The words ""Divorce Agreement"" glared up at him.
His expression darkened. He'd thought this was reconciliation.
Beatrice added, ""She requested you finish the coffee before signing.""
Nathaniel glared at the cup. ""Throw it out!""
'But you were enjoying it moments ago,' Beatrice thought, swiftly removing it.
Nathaniel scanned the agreement. She wanted nothing‚Äîno alimony, no assets.
He scoffed. How would a small-town girl survive without his money?
Then he saw her handwritten reason for divorce:
""My husband suffers from erectile dysfunction and cannot perform marital duties.""
Nathaniel's face turned thunderous.
'That damn woman!'
He grabbed his phone and dialed Harrison.
She answered immediately. ""Yes?""",1,1756215868.0,u_Holiday_Proposal3690,0,1.0,False

But I have a few runs going right now and this one I wasn't as attached to, so I decided to make this the run where I try to get the camera, I am on Voyager and have a rifle, distress pistol and revolver, plus lots of coffee. 

My plan was to start in Mystery Lake (where I feel most at home) and follow the rails into Forlorn Muskeg, Broken Railroad and all the way into Transfer Pass making my way into Sundered Pass (I'm sure there was an easier way, but this route felt safest as most of it is following the rails.)

Once I was in Sundered Pass I was very lost, but decided to trust the process and follow roads and other paths. I somehow survived my first encounter with Timberwolves, made a climb, crossed a bridge and found the weather station! 

I almost accepted that I might not get myself back to Mystery Lake too easily as, once I got the camera, I went the wrong way back down from the weather station. But somehow I kept moving, drinking alot of coffee and accidentally found the path back to Transfer Pass.

1n0m8nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n0m8nv/should_i_stay_or_go/,Should I stay or go?,"F31, dating M40. He was married and with his partner for 10 years, they have 2 kids. When we met they were 2 years divorced. No egregious reason for divorce other than they weren‚Äôt in love anymore/ weren‚Äôt getting along and decided it best to separate and coparent. She was the driver in that. 

When we met, he told me he had never felt this way for someone before, etc etc. and we have an amazing relationship. We get along really well, are living together and I really like his kids. Things with the ex have been fine she and I communicate and have met for coffee. However, I recently came across messages from when we first started dating (we‚Äôve been together almost 2 years, and these messages were from the first few months) - where he was telling friends he felt guilty about telling me he loved me because he was still in love with his ex, and had moments where he felt like they were maybe going to get back together. When she found out about me, she flipped out and started trying to see him more and said she wasn‚Äôt moved on and wanted to be back together. Then she changed her mind again. 

He has said he is still sad about the divorce and getting 50% of the time with his kids, which kills him. He‚Äôs a really really emotional and caring father, which is one of the reasons I am so in love with him. We want to have kids together and are getting close to doing that, and I‚Äôm terrified by those messages. I feel like since we have moved in together just a few months ago and I have gotten closer with his kids that our relationship feels much more solid and that he‚Äôs choosing to be with me and build a new life with me, but seeing those messages was really hard (I know, I shouldn‚Äôt have looked- it was just right in front of me) and I don‚Äôt know if I can move past it. 

Is it worth throwing everything away and starting fresh when I really love him and want to have a baby / know he would be a really great father, or should I try to be logical and understand someone may have conflicting feelings when they have kids together and a long history? He knows I saw the messages and has been insanely apologetic offering to go to therapy together and telling me every day how much he loves me and only me and wants to be with me and is choosing this new life with me even though he maybe romanticized his old life in the beginning and had fleeting moments of missing something that wasn‚Äôt real.

1n0m8g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1n0m8g0/does_lenovo_ideapad_3_laptop_offer_great_value/,Does Lenovo Ideapad 3 Laptop Offer Great Value Performance? In-Depth Review,"There‚Äôs something about unboxing and setting up a new laptop for the first time that never gets old. With the Lenovo 2022 Ideapad 3 Laptop (Model i3-1115G4), I expected a balance of function and affordability, which seems to be the ethos of this beloved brand. After a few weeks of testing, this laptop delivered exactly as advertised, but it's not without some quirks worth sharing.  

**Sleek Minimalist Design with a Practical Edge**  
The moment I pulled it out of the box and saw its clean, platinum grey exterior, I knew this laptop aimed for practicality rather than extravagant design. The 15.6"" HD touchscreen is nestled within fairly slim bezels, giving it a modern, compact feel, but it falls just a touch short of being premium. Ports are generously provided with options like HDMI, ample USB connections, and a slot for audio. I found the overall weight lightweight enough for regular commutes to work or the coffee shop. However, the plastic build might feel less robust if you‚Äôre used to aluminum-clad ultrabooks. Still, for casual or light professional use, the design is wholly appropriate.

**Performance that Matches Everyday Needs**  
Once powered up, the 11th Gen Intel Core i3 Processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM proved more than adequate for most tasks. It‚Äôs a dual-core processor, which means it isn‚Äôt necessarily gamer-centric or designed for intensive video editing, but it handled my daily barrage of 20 browser tabs, Zoom calls, and spreadsheets without slowing down. What also stood out was the 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD, boasting quick boot times and fast file transfers. It‚Äôs compactly suited for office work and student needs; however, if you‚Äôre dabbling in high-end creative applications, you might hit a performance cap.  

**[Check Lenovo 2022 Ideapad i3-1115G4 price on Amazon.](https://usegadgets.com/p/b09v273f3c/)**  

**Responsive Touchscreen with Few Trade-Offs**  
The 15.6‚Äù HD Touchscreen is a highlight in terms of ease and functionality. Its touch response is smooth, making browsing and navigation a breeze, yet the 1366 x 768 resolution feels slightly outdated against laptops sporting Full HD and 4K displays. Colors are clear but muted, and the screen struggles with deep blacks in dim lighting. It‚Äôs perfectly fine for work and occasional YouTube binges, though persistent perfectionists may find themselves craving a sharper display.

**Strengths**  
- Excellent multitasking abilities with 8GB RAM  
- Compact design, perfect for students and professionals  
- SSD ensures fast boot-up and file transfer times  
- User-friendly touchscreen with intuitive response  

**Limitations**  
- HD (1366 x 768) resolution feels antiquated  
- Plastic build isn‚Äôt as sturdy as premium options  
- Mediocre performance for gaming or high-end editing  

**The Keyboard and Trackpad Experience**  
I type a lot for work, and the keyboard was pleasantly satisfying. The keys are soft with decent feedback, and the layout didn‚Äôt feel cramped. However, the lack of backlighting was a noticeable absence for late-night typing sessions. Similarly, the trackpad is functional but could have been smoother. External peripherals are almost essential if you‚Äôre picky about precision or ergonomics.  

**Other Options**  
In its price segment, competitors like the HP Pavilion 15 or Acer Aspire 5 present themselves as alternatives worth considering. The Aspire 5, for instance, offers a Full HD display for sharper visuals and slight bumps in GPU capabilities. However, the Lenovo Ideapad is on par with them in terms of speed, affordability, and design simplicity. If a touchscreen is a non-negotiable, the Ideapad seals the deal over its rivals, bringing an interactive edge that some alternatives lack.  

**Value for Money**  
This product thrives in the ""bang for the buck"" realm, especially for those who want something user-friendly for typical office tasks, entertainment consumption, or everyday browsing. Lenovo achieves balance by sacrificing lavish materials or ultra-high processing power in exchange for essential usable features. If affordability matters as much as function, then this purchase aligns well for everyday practicality.

1n0m7qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1n0m7qn/help_computer_is_randomly_crashing/,Help - Computer is randomly crashing,"Dear community,

During the covid period I decided to build my own PC. The build was completed with exception of the GPU, which due to shortages was delivered a year later. While waiting, I bought a PS5 and have therefore never used my PC for gaming. 

Now that I work from home more often, I decided to use this expensive paperweight and noticed some random and often crashes. I was hoping this community could help me pinpoint the issue.

The crashes are as follows: The screen loses video signal, I hear a Windows notification sound and ICUE stops, which is visible due to the RGB going out of synch and their speeds ramping up. The only remedy is rebooting the PC using the power button, after which it sometimes keeps bootcycling.

The crashes appear random, but I noticed they most often occur when closing or opening games or other software. It is not related to a certain game or activity, and sometimes occurs directly after booting or after a few hours of work. I have stress tested both the CPU and GPU which appear fine with stable temps (under 80 Celsius). The problem does not occur when disconnecting the GPU and using onboard graphics.

The only critical errors in Windows Eventvwr are 41-Kernel power event, which is probably due to me hard rebooting the system.

What is strange as well, and might be an indicator, is that when I open the case while the PC is running or when I hit my desk with my chair or coffee mug, the crash also occurs.

I have already reconnected all PSU cables. Reseating the GPU is not possible due to the GPU blocking the PCI-E locking mechanism. I have tried pretty much everything.

Specs are as follows:

* CPU: Intel Core i7 10700K (was running at 5.1 GHz, now at 4.7 GHz due to this issue)
* Cooler: Corsair H115i RGB PLATINUM
* Mobo: Asus¬†ROG STRIX Z490-E GAMING
* GPU: Asus¬†GeForce RTX 3080 ROG STRIX GAMING OC V2
* RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO DDR4 3600MHz 4x8GB (running on XMP 1)
* SSD: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 1TB
* PSU: Corsair AX Series AX850",1,1756215762.0,buildapc,0,1.0,False

I had canabis-induced psychosis a few months ago and was put on 15mg of Olanzapine. When I was discharged, I was instructed to take 5mg in the morning and then 10mg at night. I did this for the next 3 weeks until I met with a psychiatrist and she said to only take the 10mg at night. The day I didn‚Äôt take the 5mg, I noticed I felt extremely depressed the next day.

I missed a dose that same week and was bumped up to 12.5mg and got horrible body tremors I couldn‚Äôt stand. The psychiatrist said I could not take it for a few days and check myself back into a psych ward over the weekend. I was looking for any reason not to take the meds, so I used that excuse and didn‚Äôt take them for the next few days(horrible decision). I felt normal mentally a few days later(realized now it was a brain zap) but then noticed I lost the ability to sleep. 

I also noticed the day afterwards, I couldn‚Äôt feel any emotions, I thought I was just depressed but I didn‚Äôt even enjoy listening to music like I usually do. I realize now I have bad anhedonia. I tried everything for sleep. Benadryl, z-quil, melatonin, valerian root, etc. All had no effect on me. Same goes for when I drink or smoke or even have coffee. I don‚Äôt even get those endorphins from working out anymore‚Ä¶

I also get no cues from my body whether i‚Äôm thirsty or hungry anymore. I believe I‚Äôve permanently damaged my nervous system. The psychiatrists i‚Äôve seen since tell me I‚Äôm depressed and i‚Äôve tried wellbutrin(made me feel like a productive robot), trazodone(did nothing for sleep, same deal with hyrdroxine, and lexapro did nothing for my mood too.

I do go finally see a neurologist next month, but I want to know as much as I can before I go because (I'm sure like a lot of you), I've had some pretty rough doctor experiences from unrelated issues

When I drink plain water, it makes my headache much worse, and all my clothes and sheets leave indentations in my skin. Like all the water is going to my skin and filling my head. I have had to have large amounts of salt (probably 5-6 grams) to help with the head pain, and so that I dont pee out everything that I drink right away. It's ironic that I actually feel the ""best"" after having McDonald's and an iced coffee now. I do try to limit my caffeine, even though it helps with pain and energy.

If I dont have enough salt, I am getting up to pee 2-3 times, sometimes more in the night. The salt also helps my overall puffiness (especially in my face and around my eyes).

I've gotten very depressed since the migraine, like its depleted all my good brain chemicals. I cry a lot now too, and its really hard to make it through the day. So probably some kind of brain imbalance.

1n0lwx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1n0lwx3/should_you_try_lapew_vanilla_cream_carpet/,Should You Try Lapew Vanilla Cream Carpet Deodorizer Powder,"Testing and reviewing the Lapew Vanilla Cream Carpet Deodorizer Powder has been an unexpectedly delightful experience. This household product, designed for tackling tough odors in carpets, upholstery, and other areas, promises a powerful performance for anyone longing to keep their home smelling fresh and clean. At first glance, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but after using the product consistently for a few weeks, I can confidently share how it fared in my home, which includes two kids, a cat with a fondness for unpredictable antics, and a partner obsessed with organization.

**Packaging and Ease of Use**  
The Lapew Vanilla Cream Carpet Deodorizer comes in a compact, easy-to-handle container. It‚Äôs neither too bulky to store nor overly flashy in design‚Äîa simple practicality I appreciate. The package dimensions of 5.87 x 2.72 x 2.6 inches make it easy to tuck into a cabinet or alongside other cleaning supplies. Sprinkling the powder is straightforward, with no mess or awkward distribution problems. I found the user-friendliness especially impressive in maintaining a clean living room carpet after those chaotic moments involving spilled snacks, muddy shoes, or occasional pet accidents.

**Vanilla Cream Fragrance: A Winning Aroma**  
The fragrance is something to highlight because it pleasantly surprised me. Unlike those harsh, chemical-heavy deodorants that make you want to hold your breath while cleaning, the Vanilla Cream scent is genuinely soothing. It creates a cozy, welcoming atmosphere while neutralizing unpleasant odors. When I sprinkled it near the cat litter box and over our rugs, the difference was immediate. That gentle, natural aroma made the space feel less like it had housed an overly energetic kitten just moments ago. The fragrance is tailored for sensitive noses, making it a great choice for households wanting subtle yet effective odor control.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
As someone constantly battling odors from spilled milk, coffee stains, and pet-related messes, I need something that actually works. This carpet deodorizer powder does more than mask unpleasant smells; it targets the odor at its root. Sprinkled on my living room carpet, I gave it a few minutes before vacuuming, and the results spoke for themselves‚Äîfresh-smelling fibers devoid of any lingering dampness or mildew-like stench. It also worked wonders on our sofa upholstery, adding a layer of freshness that no air spray ever managed to replicate.  

One thing I noticed is that this powder doesn‚Äôt clump or stick to vacuum cleaners, which is a blessing. I‚Äôve used other deodorizing powders that created more work by clogging vacuum filters, but the texture of this product is specifically designed to prevent such issues.

**Ideal for Pet Owners**  
Anyone with pets knows the struggle of maintaining a fresh-smelling home. From managing the perpetual kitty litter odor to dealing with wet dog smells, the challenge can seem never-ending. This deodorizer provided much-needed relief for me. Sprinkling some powder around the litter box and pet bed immediately reduced odors. Even the carpeted area where my cat loves to stretch post-sunbathe smelled like fresh vanilla instead of, well, cat. Plus, knowing it‚Äôs pet-friendly eased my worries of any potential harm to my fur baby.

**Highlights**  
- The fragrance provides a subtle yet effective vanilla aroma.  
- Performs exceptionally in odor-prone areas like living rooms and pet zones.  
- Works for various surfaces, including carpets, upholstery, and even around litter boxes.  
- Simple to use without creating a mess.  
- Doesn‚Äôt clog the vacuum cleaner, making cleanup easy.

**Negatives**  
Given all its bright aspects, no product is without its flaws. While I was mostly pleased, I noticed a couple of shortcomings:  
- The vanilla scent, while lovely, might not appeal universally, especially to individuals who dislike sweet fragrances.  
- More of the product is required for very large or heavily soiled carpets, slightly reducing cost efficiency.  
- Works better on newer stains than older, stubborn smells ingrained in thicker carpets or rugs.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Scent preference can be subjective and may not cater to everyone.  
- Deep cleaning large carpets may exhaust the product faster.  

**Competitive Options**  
Looking at alternatives in the market, Febreze Carpet Deodorizing Powder, for example, has a similar easy-application style but comes at the expense of stronger, sometimes overwhelming scents. Arm & Hammer is another contender and delivers comparable odor-eliminating benefits; however, its coarse texture tends to result in minor clogs or uneven application. The Lapew product brings a refined formula, a gentler aroma, and broader versatility that fits well into any cleaning routine. Its advantage lies in the balance between efficiency and safety for pet-friendly homes.

**Smart Spending**  
When weighing this product‚Äôs performance with its cost, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel I was getting great overall value. It doesn‚Äôt just replace the need for other air fresheners; it cuts down the grunt work involved in cleaning and refreshing my carpets and furniture. For families, pet owners, or anyone who prioritizes cleanliness without compromising aesthetic and sensory comfort, it‚Äôs worth considering.

1n0lwjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolboxTruth/comments/1n0lwjo/evaluate_best_drill_driver_porter_cable_pcc601/,Evaluate best drill driver Porter Cable PCC601 for your next project?,"The Porter Cable PCC601 drill driver has found its way into my toolbox, and after using it extensively for everyday tasks and some tougher projects, I‚Äôve gathered plenty of insights to share. Compact, lightweight, and surprisingly robust, it‚Äôs clearly designed for both amateur DIY enthusiasts and seasoned handymen. Its claim of being user-friendly while packed with power intrigued me from the start, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to test its limits.

**Design and Build Quality**

I have to admit, the first thing that caught my attention was how lightweight this drill driver is. At just 2.5 pounds, it feels like holding a cup of coffee rather than a power tool. This has been a lifesaver during longer projects, sparing my wrists from unnecessary strain. The compact size‚Äî8.25 inches long‚Äîwas another plus, allowing me to navigate tight spaces without the usual fuss. The gray plastic finish combined with steel components strikes the right balance between portability and durability. While the overall build is sturdy, I noticed that it doesn't feel quite as premium as some higher-priced alternatives, but it certainly doesn't compromise functionality.

**Performance and Two-Speed Gearbox**

The 20V motor packed inside this drill is no slouch when it comes to delivering performance. With a two-speed gearbox that allows users to switch between 0-350 RPM and 0-2000 RPM, it‚Äôs versatile enough for multiple tasks. Whether I was drilling through wood, basic metal pieces, or driving screws into drywall, it handled like a pro without getting overheated. Although the torque isn‚Äôt the highest I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs more than adequate for lightweight to medium-duty applications, meeting the needs of most non-industrial tasks. The keyless chuck makes swapping out bits a breeze, which cuts down on setup time and keeps things moving efficiently.

**Key Benefits**

- Lightweight design reduces fatigue during extended use.
- Compact size is ideal for hard-to-reach spaces.
- Two-speed gearbox offers more control across varied applications.
- Bright LED light improves visibility in dimly lit areas.

[Check Porter Cable PCC601 price on Amazon.](https://toolsmaestro.com/p/b00iqyn0u4/)

**LED Light and Ergonomics**

One feature that genuinely impressed me was the LED light located near the trigger. It might not sound revolutionary, but this feature saved me when I needed to drill in a poorly-lit crawlspace. Unlike the dim LEDs on some power tools, this one was surprisingly bright, a detail I truly appreciated. As for ergonomics, the handle is comfortably designed with a rubberized grip that feels steady even in sweaty or gloved hands. While the materials are sturdy, it‚Äôs clear that the focus here leans more towards functionality over aesthetics.

**Good Points**

- **Simple Design:** Minimal controls and clear markings make it beginner-friendly.
- **Bright LED Light:** Essential for low-visibility spaces.
- **Efficient Power Use:** Battery life lasts decently long with moderate usage.
- **Portable Weight:** Easy to carry to job sites or around the house.

**Downsides**

Reliability aside, there are some shortcomings. First, this drill driver doesn‚Äôt come with batteries or a charger. Purchasing these separately adds to the overall cost, which might be frustrating if you‚Äôre expecting an all-in-one deal right out of the box. Additionally, while the compact design is great for certain tasks, it‚Äôs underpowered for heavy-duty applications, such as drilling through thick composite materials or dense concrete. Lastly, I noticed the body tends to collect dust and grime easily because of its finish material, requiring frequent cleaning to maintain its appearance.

- Must purchase battery and charger separately.
- Limited torque for heavy-duty work.
- Plastic body feels less rugged compared to premium brands.

**Competing Products**

When lined up against well-known competitors like the DeWalt DCD771C2 and Makita XFD131, the Porter Cable PCC601 holds its own in some areas but lags in others. It triumphs in terms of being lighter and more affordable, making it perfect for casual users or quick fixes. However, compared to DeWalt‚Äôs models, which offer higher torque and longer-lasting batteries, this drill may feel underpowered. Makita edges ahead in terms of sheer build quality and ergonomic design. But if your main concerns are portability and ease of handling, Porter Cable‚Äôs drill makes a compelling case.

**Value Evaluation**

Given the category this drill driver falls into, its price point feels appropriate. It‚Äôs neither high-end nor the cheapest in the market, making it ideal for someone looking for a balance between performance and cost. The absence of included batteries and a charger does extend the price burden slightly, but beyond that, you get a durable, user-friendly tool with enough power to tackle regular home improvement tasks. From assembling furniture to small repairs, it has handled everything I threw at it without faltering.

The Starbucks K-Cup Coffee Pods, House Blend, and Medium Roast (model B0C6FKJ4LZ) have completely redefined my mornings. As someone who relies on coffee to kickstart the day, this medium roast has been my trusty companion for weeks. Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, it combines an enticing aroma, smooth flavor, and the convenience only a pod system can offer. Yet, like many products, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Rich Flavor and Aroma: The Star of This Blend**

What strikes me first every morning is the luscious aroma that fills my kitchen. These premium coffee pods deliver a balanced taste that features notes of toffee and cocoa. Honestly, the toffee undertone adds a subtle sweetness that I‚Äôve come to adore. Whether I drink it black or toss in a splash of almond milk, the flavor remains indulgent yet approachable. It‚Äôs like having a coffee shop in my home, minus the barista flair.

[Check Starbucks B0C6FKJ4LZ price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c6fkj4lz/)

**Performance that Matches Daily Convenience**

From the moment I loaded the pod into my Keurig, the performance was seamless. Each cup brews in under two minutes without any mess or hassle. The capsules are perfectly designed to fit and leave no grounds behind‚Äîsomething that has annoyed me with other pods in the past. The consistency is remarkable, whether it‚Äôs my first cup of the day or the third one during a midday slump.

**Highlights**

- Smooth, medium roast blend with a harmonious balance of toffee and cocoa notes.  
- Compatible with Keurig brewers for hassle-free and fast brewing.  
- Ethically sourced, adhering to quality standards that align with sustainable coffee farming.

**Packaging: User-Friendly but Bulky**

Opening the box of 75 pods was satisfying, though the packaging is undeniably large. For someone like me who loves to keep their pantry neat, finding the space was a minor inconvenience. However, the freshness seal does its job flawlessly. Every pod I‚Äôve tried feels as though it‚Äôs been freshly packed, which is vital for maintaining that vibrant aroma and flavor. Kudos to Starbucks for such airtight packaging.

**Negatives**

- The large package requires adequate storage space.  
- Pods are non-compostable, which may pose an issue for eco-conscious users.  

**Wide Appeal: Ideal for Beginners and Enthusiasts**

What makes this coffee unique is its versatility. I offered a cup to my somewhat skeptical coworker, who leans more towards dark roasts, and even she found it surprisingly enjoyable. Its well-rounded profile ensures that whether you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast or a casual drinker, this blend holds universal appeal. While some might prefer stronger brews, this sits squarely in the crowd-pleasing middle ground.

**Competitive Options Worth Considering**

When comparing this to Nespresso OriginalLine pods, I found the Starbucks offering to be less intense in flavor but far more balanced for daily drinking. Similarly, Green Mountain‚Äôs pods lean more acidic, which wasn‚Äôt my favorite. For those submerging themselves into the pod-coffee trend, these Starbucks pods land comfortably on the higher quality spectrum without veering into overly fancy territory that would alienate casual drinkers.

**Price Worthiness**

Let‚Äôs talk about cost. Though not the cheapest pods in the market, these deliver a phenomenal cup every time. If you‚Äôre looking for an elevated coffee experience at home without paying caf√© prices, the slight premium is worth it. Plus, buying in bulk with this 75-count package makes it economical in the long run. Considering its taste, consistency, and ease of use, it‚Äôs truly a balance of quality and convenience.

1n0lsjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1n0lsjc/strange_dream_the_hotelhospitalmall_hybrid_and/,Strange dream : the hotel-hospital-mall hybrid and the mysterious tower,"TL;DR: I dreamed of a hybrid liminal space (hotel/hospital/mall) where hot chocolate apparently drugged me. After sleeping in a hotel room and waking up at the same place(!), I explored a supermarket that transformed into a degraded labyrinth. While looking for the exit, I discovered a medieval staircase leading to a tower, where a mysterious voice explained that I needed to change perspective if i wanted to get out.

---

Hey r/Dreams! I had a really weird dream last night and would love to hear your thoughts.


[The Beginning - The Hybrid Space] :

I enter the lobby of a hotel that looks ordinary from the outside but luxurious inside. The reception desk is split into two sections: coffee on one side, hot chocolate on the other. I choose hot chocolate and go sit in the waiting area.

I then realize this place is actually a weird mix: 20% hotel, 40% mall, 40% hospital. But an ideal hospital - beautiful and welcoming. It was clearly a liminal space.


[The conference incident üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è ] :

I hear a conference in a hallway and go check it out. It was packed with people. A woman in the audience suddenly turn around and gaze at me like i was an alien. It freaked me out, I realized I shouldn't be there... I return to the lobby. 

Suddenly, I feel completely confused and drowsy, as if I'd been drugged. This sensation lasts a very long time - several hours in dream time, which is rare for me. It was like being completely drunk.


[Falling Asleep while dreaming.]

I finally see someone passing by in the hall, and ask him for help. He suggests coffee might work as an antidote. Instead of simply asking for one, I thank him and go wander off, looking for a coffee machine. Spoiler : i never found it. I end up in an empty hotel room and fall asleep on a bed that's exactly identical to mine IRL.

*Brief awakening in real life, then I fall back asleep and return to the same dream => ""wake/back-to-bed""*

[The liminal space turns to something else...]

I wake up in the same dream bed, but I'm normal now. I decide to explore the supermarket and discover lots of beautiful objects you never see in these kinds of places.

Closing time arrives. I look for an exit but nothing makes sense. The environment gradually degrades: tagged walls, harsh neon lighting, everything becomes dirty. The vibes are off.

[The Tower]

While searching for an exit in this labyrinth, I come across a medieval staircase going up. After a few meters, a trapdoor blocks the passage. I glimpse the top of a tower through a crack.

A voice from above calls to me and says it will take me to the top, that it's easy. I reply that the passage is too narrow, it seems impossible. The voice laughs and explains it's because I'm looking from the ""latrines""  (the lowest point), but if I observe from another viewpoint, the ascent will look more accessible. She made it sound like a mindset thing.

What do you think ? That bit about changing perspective at the end really intrigues me. Have any of you had dreams with such hybrid spaces ?",1,1756214718.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False
1n0lsaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1n0lsaa/my_exploration_of_specialty_coffee_is/,"My exploration of ""specialty coffee"" is inconsistent.  Is this normal?","Over the past 6-8 months I have been exploring higher end coffee's to grind and brew with espresso, pour over and aeropress.  My history prior was preground columbians from a drip machine, wife was in charge and I just rolled with it.  

What I have seen is what I would call surprising given the cost of the beans alone.  I have tried about 6-7 different roasters, some popular on here and other not.  About half of them I have found quality beans that are tastes that I love and want to continue exploring.  Unfortunately when I go back for more from those favorable flavor/roasters I am consistently disappointed.  

What is at first OMG, I found the roaster(s) I really enjoy with wonderful flavors at the first bag or two then become bags of bland tasting beans upon a subsequent orders.  This is with proper resting times, consistent and explored brew times/methods with quality grinder (K6) and fluctuating grinds.  

I am resting another company and I'm better there's some good flavors in at least one of the bags and I'm hoping future explorations in this roaster and others, maybe, will be equivalent in quality.  

The inconsistency comes from one batch being hyper-flavorful and others being bland.  Tasting notes are marked as different of course though the STRENGTH of those notes are what is not successful across bean origin or roast.  The ones I like a very bright and obvious. 

I suspect the answer is ""this is normal"" and possibly more experience identifying the batch as worthwhile or not is the answer but I'm wondering if this is the norm.

1n0lr9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n0lr9s/what_the_hell_even_was_that/,What The Hell Even Was That,"Hey all, 

I (F,28) recently went through a messed up situation that kinda mind-fucked me. I'm certain that other people have had a similar experience to this and will feel some sort of solidarity from my experience. 

For context, I had been out of a long term relationship for about two years, and decided to put myself back out there per the suggestion of my friends. I didn't really feel like online dating was for me, but I gave it a go. After several very weird dates, I realized that I was correct in the first place. 

I went to delete my account, but had found that an old friend from middle/high school had swiped on me. I swiped back and he messaged me. We chatted for a bit on the app, before he asked me to catch up over coffee sometime and left me his number. 

The first date went really well. Fast forward to several months in and we've met each other's families, we hang out every weekend, and we've introduced each other to friends as boyfriend/girlfriend. We do have this discussion within this time about how we both have had some crappy relationship experiences and how both of us wanna take it slow and not jump into anything head first. 

Neither of us ever said we didn't EVER want a long term relationship together, just that we needed to take things slow, as we both had some issues with emotional unavailability in our current place in life. We communicated our reluctance to one another the whole time. We didn't become physical until almost 6 months in, but the first time we did, I ended up pregnant afterward. I told him I wasn't on birth control and to please pull out. He made no attempt. I knew I should have theoretically been out of the ovulation window, but still immediately took a Plan B just in case. It didn't work. This was my first pregnancy ever and I felt stupid for our negligence. I was terrified, but he eased my anxiety and told me that it was all going to be ok and how much this could even be the best thing that's ever happened to us. 

We were both scared of how little of time we had been dating, but he assured me that he was supportive of whatever decision I made and he would be there for me, even if that meant parenthood together. He sent me a very sweet text about how much he would love me and this baby and said how he didn't think he'd be a father, but could see himself raising a child with me.

Then he pulled the rug a week later. The fear sunk in and he told me how he didn't feel ready and that we was terrified of this blowing up in our faces. I was patient and understanding of this, but was a little confused by the total 180 in thought. He had previously told me what a great partner he thought I was and that we could make this work, but now was saying what a disaster this could be. Unfortunately, the universe decided for us, and the baby didn't make it.

He took me to the doctors and then spent the day with me, holding me while I cried in emotional and physical pain from the experience. He was caring and attentive to me the whole time until after I went home that evening. Then he became very distant.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just grieving. I told my therapist about it and she agreed that he was probably processing things in his own way. I tried to reach out and keep open communication between us. He would go almost entire days without talking to me and we didn't see each other for a couple of weeks. I didn't take this personally, but admittedly did feel really alone through the horrendous emotional hormone crash and grief that occurs after. I was also dealing with other heavy family issues at the time that added to all of this. I was honest about how bad I felt whenever he would reach out, but did want to give him his space as well, and not overwhelm him while he was grieving too. 

After a couple of weeks, I finally reached out to him asking him to meet me for lunch some time on my weekend off. He told me he was busy all weekend except Sunday evening and invited me to dinner with his parents. He was very strange and anxious the entire dinner, and in a nice way, asked me to go home early after we got back to his place afterward. We planned on watching a show together, but he said he didn't feel well. I kinda felt like that was bullshit, but I felt like maybe I was being insecure. 

The following day he casually mentioned in text conversation that he had been fucking his ex, basically since I was pregnant. I told him how disappointing that news was and left it at that. Haven't contacted him since and probably never will. I don't feel like there's anything to say. I don't feel like I should have to explain to a grown adult man, how screwed up that is, so I will not. 

I'm going to therapy and talking to friends about this. I feel whiplashed by the situation. I know how shitty people can be so I don't know why these things still surprise me when they happen, but basically wtf. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Hope everyone is doing well. ",1,1756214629.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1n0lqw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrow/comments/1n0lqw8/the_crow_angel_of_death/,The Crow: Angel of Death,"*Here's an idea for a Crow book or film:*

This is the story of¬†**Sean Kraher**, a construction worker with a taste for Metalcore music from the fictional¬†**Corvus County, Kansas**, who just graduated High School and is currently in a romantic relationship with a girl named¬†**Hailey Vasquez**, who is hearing-impaired and a highly-skilled ballerina in which despite her disability, is given an offer to dance for the Chicago Ballet. Sean has been supportive of her aspirations in which he attended some of her past competitions and even learned sign language to communicate with her. Sean even considered leaving Kansas with her for Chicago and spoke with his family about it, much to his father's dismay, since he was also his boss in the Construction field.

One day during the evening, Sean received a text from Hailey to meet him at their spot, a massive Juniper tree overlooking the Arkansas River and showed him the outfit she was going to wear for her repertoire she was planning to perform in front of the Chicago Ballet Board. They are immediately surrounded by members of a militia group known as the Dixie Boys. Kraher tried to protect Hailey but he was outnumbered 9 to 1 and was beaten to a pulp. The group was lead by¬†**Logan Mauser**, the leader of the¬†**Dixie Boys Kansas Charter**¬†who was raping Hailey and forced Sean to watch as he berated him and flipped him off while committing the heinous crime. Two other guys, Logan's brother¬†**Cory Mauser**, was sitting on top of Sean while¬†**Chad Bradford**, was holding Sean's head and forcing him to watch Hailey in her time of need.¬†**Darren Potts**¬†was constantly berating and slapping Sean as he was forced to watch what was happening.¬†**Nat Fowler**¬†was another guy as Sean watched Nat hit Hailey with his fists, in which Sean was unable to do anything with a 350 lb Cory Mauser sitting on top of him. The only female of the crew,¬†**Alice Kearney**, ripped off Hailey's necklace that Sean personally gave her, a golden laced necklace with a ballerina pendant, all the while berating Hailey and kicking dirt in her face. Sean noticed¬†**Kyle Neumann**¬†filming the crime they're committing on his Smartphone. Sean also watched helplessly as¬†**Albie White**¬†torn off Hailey's ballet tutu like it was papier mache and laughed his ass off about it. The ninth member,¬†**Lane Pollard**,¬†gave Sean the coup de grace as he took a pistol and finished off Sean.

*Shortly after, Sean and Hailey are dead, however, there are reports that Sean beat and raped Hailey and she tried to fight him off, eventually shooting him but dying from her wounds. The Dixie Boys picked up Hailey's phone writing a message ""I'm breaking up with you!"" to make it look like a breakup gone bad. Sean's family requested an autopsy on his cadaver, only to learn that the Coroner had already cremated him to ash, which his father did not approve of. Sean's family was ostracized and chased out of Corvus County and the efforts to chase them off were lead by Local Police Chief*¬†***Jared Strout***.¬†*Before deciding to leave Corvus County, the Kraher family held a small vigil for Sean as they poured his ashes from a bridge into the Arkansas, while refusing to believe that Sean would be capable of such a crime.*

A little over a year has passed since it all happened and it is harvest season. A¬†crow¬†has appeared on the bridge where Sean's ashes were scattered. The crow tapped it's beak on the bridge and Sean manifested from the waters and started crawling out of the river onto dry land wearing the clothes he wore the night of the murders. He was immediately bit by a copperhead, in which he was unaffected as he watched the venom push out of his wound while the snakebite rapidly healed. Sean soon realized he could heal fast and could not be harmed. Sean approached the Juniper tree that he and Hailey made their official spot and upon touching it, he witnessed the final moments of his life as he watched in horror of the events that unfolded. Sean became astounded as to why he returned and not Hailey, as she had a brighter future than he did. He returned to what was once his hometown to find it drug-ridden and desolate along with political signs with Strout running for Sheriff. He finds his house vandalized with black spray paint saying ""A Rapist Lived Here."" After seeing that, Sean reacted by punching a hole through an outer wall, discovering his superior strength. An old pickup truck pulled up and an older man pulled a shotgun on him, demanding to know what he was doing on his families property. Sean recognized him as his¬†**Uncle Bart**¬†while stating he lived there his whole life. Bart was in shock and awe to see his nephew among the living. They went to Bart's farm in the outskirts where they were greeted by Sean's deeply religious¬†**Aunt Daisy**, who was stunned by Sean's appearance. Sean touched them both, in which he not only showed them the events of what really happened to him and Hailey, but learned that he was framed for Hailey's murder and it was covered up because he was cremated before given an autopsy. He also discovered that his parents were ostracized to the point to where they had to leave Corvus County. That is when Sean realized he had the ability to not only pass on his knowledge to others, but read through their memories as well. Sean went into his Uncle's paint shed where he stripped naked, doused himself in white paint, used black paint for his hair and facial featured, and then grabbed some black work boots, black work overalls, and a black heavy raincoat. His Uncle then asked what his plan was and Sean told him that 9 people were involved that day and needed to answer for it. Bart threw Sean a set of keys, revealing that Bart kept Seans Black and white-striped 1971 Chevy Camaro SS, and even modified it, and told Sean to ""Give 'em Hell"". With the help of Ravens scouring Corvus County, Sean was able to find some members of the Dixie Boys responsible for that day.

**Kyle Neumann**

Sean first set his sights on Kyle Neumann, the guy who filmed the rape and murders on his phone. Sean found him working at a liquor store in town. He shut off the power to the place, prompting Kyle to grab a shotgun and a flashlight. Sean appeared and Kyle fired a shot at him, in which Sean immediately healed fast. Sean then knocked the gun away from Kyle and began throwing him into several liquor displays. Kyle soon recognized Kraher, distraught by the fact that he was walking among them. He then grabbed his head to read his memory, and in the memory, in the aftermath of the crime, Sean witnessed Chief Strout appearing at the crime scene during which he told Kyle to delete the video in which Kyle instead deleted the video from his phone but saved it into the Cloud. Sean even saw a memory of Kyle along with Albie White and Nat Fowler holding a woman and her 2 daughters hostage, forcing the woman to tell her husband over the phone that they're threatening to kill her if he didn't give them what they wanted. Sean soon realized that Kyle didn't completely erase the video as it was still in the Cloud, realizing that would be the evidence to not only clear his name, but restored his family name, convict Logan and his crew as well as convict and ruin a politically motivated Chief Strout. Refusing to let revenge slide, Sean staked Kyle's hands to a wall, took a baseball bat and some liquor bottles where he started swinging at the bottles, hitting Kyle with glass shards and liquor until he was covered in glass and blood and dead, leaving a bloody raven emblem depicted on the wall he was pinned to. Sean then took a photo of Hailey and a letter in which he took a knife and stuck the photo and the letter to Kyle's body. The letter wrote,¬†*""She had a bright future ahead of her, a dream she wanted to fulfill, and what happened to her was a travesty. This heathen has answered for his actions, and there are others who will share his fate.""*¬†Sean then collected Kyle's phone to try to access the Cloud to find it password-based and realized he could not crack the phone on his own.

**Alice Kearney**

The ravens then lead Sean to Alice, who stole Hailey's necklace that Kraher gifted her. He tracked Alice to the local town press, the Corvus County Herald, where she, accompanied by 2 thugs, hassled the local publisher about what was in the newspaper that offended her. Kraher then made some luring noises in the building, during which he killed the 2 thugs. When Alice found herself in the Printing Press room, she encountered Sean, during which she immediately recognized him and started freaking out. Kraher demanded to know what she did with Hailey's necklace and Alice claimed that she sold it over a year ago. Sean then tapped into Alice's memory to confirmed that she sold it to a pawn broker. Kraher then said ""Looks like the press is out of black ink, so red will do just fine."" and immediately turned on the paper rolling machine and tossed Alice into the machine, crushing her and leaving a gory mess to which newspapers with bloody raven insignias started popping out. Sean then placed a photo of Hailey and a letter near the bloody newspapers and the letter said,¬†*""There was a particular whore who took more than just a life from this girl, she took her future from her, as well as something of great value, Hell is coming for those who were apart of this event.""*¬†As Sean started to leave, he told the Publisher that he may want to clean up the press room as it was a mess. The Publisher fainted as Sean left. Sean then found the pawn shop where Alice pawned the necklace. He broke into the shop and made a desperate search for Hailey's necklace and upon finding it, he tapped into a series of memories of him and Hailey as well as watching Hailey performing several ballet repertoires. Sean held the necklace with the ballerina pendant to his face, knowing it was his current connection to Hailey. Upon exiting the building, a police cruiser pulled up to respond to a breaking and entering. Sean recognized the officer, Sergeant¬†**Bill Tomlin**, a friend to the Krahers and the only cop in Corvus County who is not afraid of Strout. Tomlin didn't recognize Sean as he had his gun drawn but was distracted by a crow, giving Sean time to flee.

Sean then appeared at the home of someone he knew in High School,¬†**Rupert Flemish**, who knows a bit about filmmaking and modifications to films and is even going to study filmmaking in College. He also knew Rupert was tech-savvy and could hack into Kyle's Smartphone. Flemish was shocked to see Kraher alive but wary of him after learning about the incident a year prior. Sean then tapped into Rupert's mind, revealing that he was set up and murdered himself. Kraher also told Flemish that Kyle videotaped everything and claimed that if the video uploaded to the Cloud on Kyle's Smartphone still existed, it would clear his name and end the Dixie Boys Charter in the area, while bringing down Strout. Rupert told Sean it was a long shot but he could hack the phone to bypass Kyle's password and possibly recover the video. Kraher then told Rupert that 7 more people needed to answer for what happened to Hailey and left Rupert to hacking the Smartphone. Meanwhile, the local police department responded to the incident at the Press Office and Strout told some of cops there, including Tomlin, who was present, to cover this up, fearing the repercussions in the upcoming November election. Strout then called up Logan and warned him of Kyle and Alice's death, citing that they may have a leak, demanding he ""Handle This"".

**Chad Bradford**

Chad was next to face Sean's wrath, after being forced by him to watch as Logan was raping and killing Hailey. He was starting a shift on a farm before the crack of dawn. Chad immediately started hearing several heavy machines turning on. He had his pistol on standby and Sean immediately flew at Chad, knocking him to the ground. Chad then shot Sean in the neck, only to watch the wound immediately heal. Sean then went to work on Chad, giving him a beating and throwing him around. After recognizing Sean, Chad lost it, claiming he was turned to powder, calling Sean's resurrection impossible. Sean tapped into Chad's memory, revealing he was at the Coroners office when Strout threatened the Coroner into fast pacing Sean's cremation. He even watched as Strout handed the Coroner a piece of paper with a phone number on it, telling him to call that number. The Coroner recognized that number and upon calling it, his wife was on the line telling him there were people there threatening to kill her if they didn't get what they wanted. Sean then witnessed the Coroner cave just to protect his family. He soon realized the woman and two girls held hostage from Kyle's memory were the Coroner's wife and daughters. Before deciding how to kill Chad, Sean demanded to know why Strout was specifically targeting him. Chad then stated to Sean that he was just a casualty for an even bigger enterprise and his ""Whole F\*\*\*\*\*\* Family"" was standing in their way. Sean then spotted a mirror in the barn as he dragged Chad inside, stuck a pitchfork through his leg, pinning him to a barn post and taking a metal stake through his right shoulder, pinning it to the barn post as well. Kraher then grabbed a felt stapler and stapled Chad's eyelids open, forcing him to look at the mirror, and stated, ""Do you know what it feels like to watch someone you truly loved spend her final moments in shear horror and you could do nothing about it? Do you know what it's like to be helpless and be forced to see your own world ripped away from you? You forced me against my will to watch someone I held dear in my heart to be taken away. Today, you get to watch your life end."" Sean then took a strap to Chad's head, making sure Chad didn't move his head away and walked to a combine harvester, which was already turned on. Sean activated the combine head reel and set the machine in drive, enabling it to head toward the barn with Chad inside. The combine tore into the barn and the head rakes tore through Chad. Beforehand, Sean left a photo of Hailey in the combine driver seat along with a letter saying,¬†*""To being forced to see something beautiful ripped from you is a great tragedy. This bastard died today because he made sure her last moment on Earth was witnessed. Today he witnessed his downfall as will those involved this senseless act against her.""*¬†Sean left the area and the harvesters grain chopper spat out Chad's remains and blood, leaving a gory image of the crow insignia.

Sean later went to Hailey's childhood home just as dawn was upon the horizon. He went into the home and entered her bedroom consisting of her ballet memorabilia and her competition trophies. Sean picked up a portrait of her posing during a competition and reminisced upon it. Hailey's father,¬†**Ignacio Vasquez**, the local dentist, entered his kitchen with his gun drawn, demanding to know who he was and why Sean broke into his home. Sean then turned his attention to him and Ignacio immediately recognized Sean, further frustrating him, believing the story that Sean killed his little girl. His wife,¬†**Lucia Vasquez**, entered the room and recognized Sean as well. Both of them were disgusted to see Kraher alive and Sean attempted to convince them that he didn't rape and kill Hailey. Ignacio was prepared to shoot him and Sean told Ignacio that if he truly believed that he was responsible, he should pull the trigger. As Ignacio was debating going for the kill, Sean tapped into Ignacio's mind revealing the truth about his and Hailey's murder. Ignacio lower his weapon and Lucia was distraught by the reaction, believing Sean hexed her husband. Sean then showed Lucia the same truth as he tapped her mind to reveal his innocence. Lucia, now realizing the truth about Hailey's murder, fell to her knees and cried. Ignacio soon came to his senses, claiming even before the events, he never truly approved of Sean or his taste in music, once calling him a bad influence. Sean admitted that he was never perfect, but promised to set things right. Ignacio, recognizing one of the faces from the event he was shown, then told Sean that Lane Pollard, the guy who shot and killed Sean, is a client at his dentistry and is scheduled for a procedure that day. Ignacio then gave Sean his blessing to send the remaining six, including Lane, to Hell, while requesting that none of his staff gets hurt in the process.

**Lane Pollard**

Lane arrived at the dentistry to have some cavities filled in his teeth. When put in the room for the procedure, he sat in the chair and a nurse walked in. Sean then walked in the room in which the nurse reacted and he began duct taping Lane's arm to the armrests. Lane attempted to reach for his pistol, but was immediately stopped by Kraher, who then continued to duct tape Lane's legs and torso to the chair. Sean then ordered the nurse to pull out her phone and ""Record this"". Lane flipped out, threatening to kill him, in which Sean replied, ""But you already have! Remember?"" Recognizing Raben, Lane blasted out ""I f\*\*\*\*\*\* killed you! I F\*\*\*\*\*\* KILLED YOU!"" Sean then furthered Lane's torment as he reached for the drills to do some ""Marathon Man Style S#!t"" on Lane, causing him excruciating pain. Sean then demanded answers to why they needed his family chased out of town. Lane refused to give him any information so Kraher tapped into Pollards mind, seeing a¬†**Farm**¬†with little to no animals and delivery trucks loading various crates from a massive metal building there, along with some armed security. Sean recognized the area the Farm was on but never recalled a farm being built there as it was a parcel of land his father was bidding for to build a warehouse and a manufacturing building for his construction company. Sean slowly put the pieces together as he took the drill, cut through Lane upper body drawing a crow insignia, and then slit open Lane's throat with the drill. The nurse was in sheer horror as Kraher looked toward her phone, pulled out a photo of Hailey, and sent a warning that ""The Angel of Death is coming for the ones responsible!"" He then ended it with saying, ""Sean Kraher sends his regards."" The crow lands on Sean's shoulder as he orders the nurse to stop the recording and post it on every social media site. He was able to escape the Dentistry and evade the cops who surrounded the building. Strout entered the Dentistry to find Lane brutally killed and Tomlin asking questions to find that the nurse had filmed the slaying against her will and sent the video to the web. Tomlin watched the video, recognizing the freak he saw at the pawn shop, but soon realized it was Kraher, back from the dead. Strout recognized Sean as well upon seeing the video. Strout then walked out to his patrol car, contacted Logan, and warned him that Sean Kraher was alive, despite watching his body be cremated. There was a raven nearby, giving Sean the opportunity to eavesdrop on Strout. The police sergeant then accused the Coroner of botching the cremation and demanded that the Coroner and his family are ""Dealt With"".

At the Farm, the remaining 5, Logan, Darren, Cory, Albie, and Nat, are arguing over the fact that Kraher was suppose to be dead and they sent Cory and a crew of gunmen to hit the Coroner's home. Logan's girlfriend,¬†**Ainsley Reagan**, was bringing Logan a beer but accidently dropped it in front of him. Logan slapped her to the ground as a response and demanded she bring him another one. A timid Ainsley in a panic rushed back to the house to fetch another one. After seeing the video of Kraher killing Lane, Darren noticed the crow on his shoulder, during which he revealed that he once learned of a urban myth of people coming back from the dead and being followed by crows. Logan soon saw this as a problem and was eager to find a way to terminate the issue. Now aware that the Coroner and his family were in danger, Kraher raced to his home in the outskirts. He then received a call from Rupert stating that he was able to bypass Kyle's phone, but his Cloud access had a secret password with a facial scan, which would take more time to access, but made it clear it wasn't impossible to hack. Sean then asked Rupert to also look into the parcel of land his father was bidding on but now has a farm on it. Rupert agreed before Sean hung up. Sean then arrived to the home of¬†**Mark Edelmann**, the Coroner. Mark panicked to the sight of Kraher, fearing for his life and his families as well. Sean then told Mark that his quarrel was not with him, for he and his family were just as much victims as he and Hailey were. Sean then tapped into the Coroners head to show him the truth, all the while warning him that Strout ordered the Dixie Boys to kill him and his family. Kraher then urged Mark to take his wife and daughters, invoke his vacation time, pack some clothes and essentials, and head out of town for a while. Sean told the Edelmann's to use cash, not credit cards, and even asked Mark if his home was ""Insured"". As the Edelmann's got down the road, Sean then noticed a machine with a wrecking ball in the next door lot.

**Cory Mauser**

Cory and his hit team showed up to the Edelmann residents and began shooting up the building. They then fired rounds into the house and immediately moved into the home to search for survivors or bodies. One by one, Sean began picking off Cory's men, making Cory last. Kraher then charged at Cory and they engaged in a fist fight. Kraher then grabbed a pickaxe struck it through Cory's leg, also pinning it to a wall. Cory attempted to pull the pickaxe out to no avail while Kraher inquired about the Farm in which Cory responded with ""Go F\*\*\* Yourself"". Kraher then reminded Cory of the fact of how helpless he felt when he watched Logan rape and kill Hailey and could do nothing because Cory was sitting on top of him. He then stated, ""All that weight crushing me. Well Cory, you're about to feel the weight of this house when I drop it onto your fat ass!"" Sean then exited the house to head to the next yard where he acquired the machine with the wrecking ball. Cory, desperately attempted to break free of the pickaxe pinning him to the wall, watched as Sean drove the machine with the wrecking ball toward the house. Sean operated the machine to swing the wrecking ball at the house, demolishing it and killing Cory in the process, he then swung it once more for good measure, providing an aerial view of the house debris in the form of a crow insignia.

Kraher then headed to Rupert's house and learned that he had not only accessed Kyle's Cloud data, but found the video intended to clear Sean of any wrongdoing and made a hardcopy onto a disc. Sean then encountered Rupert's brother,¬†**Sam Flemish**, who was ecstatic to see him alive claiming he never believed the stories about Sean killing Hailey and offered to help. Sean stated to Rupert that he needed to know more about the Farm that Logan and his crew were operating at and requested him not to release the video until he gathered all his facts. Rupert then informed Sean that his search for information about Strout's connection to the Farm came up empty but learned a Shell Company purchased a parcel of land shortly after the Krahers moved out of Corvus County. Knowing he was in for a fight, Sean went back to his Uncle Bart's home that night to gather some weapons. There, he came across his father,¬†**Edmond Kraher**, who showed up out of the blue after hearing rumors of his son being alive. They hugged it out and rectified their relationship. Sean then confirmed Edmond's suspicions as he tapped into his memory, showing him the truth about his and Hailey's murder. Edmond then told Sean that Jared Strout was the person bidding against him for the property and revealed that he would find it odd for Strout to even run a farm. Sean then pondered what was going on with that Farm. Using the ravens in the skies of Corvus County to further investigate the farm, he discovered the crates being shipped weren't exactly carrying eggs or milk. He even noticed some workers in the metal building wearing hazardous protection gear with gas masks and goggles, indicating a drug operation and noticed the excessive security detail on duty. Sean confirmed his suspicion when one of the crates fell over, spilling the contents of methamphetamine and watched Darren lash out at the worker for spilling the contents. Sean then asked his father to stay out of the fight, citing that only one of them is dead and refused to allow another loved one to be killed ""By these Bastards""!

Sergeant Tomlin was at a diner enjoying his burger and fries with a cup of coffee while going over some images of Kraher before the murders compare to Kraher as the Crow. An **Old Waiter** approached Tomlin to top up his coffee cup and upon seeing the case photos, the waiter said, ""It's happening again!"" Tomlin was curious about the waiters response and the waiter told Tomlin that he heard stories about this kind of event and even witnessed this in person once. The waiter then brought Tomlin to the back room where he brought forth a file from New Orleans in 1965 consisting of old photos and newspapers. The waiter then told Tomlin of a story of a black bebop guitarist named Alton Corbeau who was framed for killing a white woman and lynched by an angry mob outside the city. The waiter then revealed that white woman was his lover and Alton was set up by a group of White Supremacists who killed the girl for being ""sweet"" on a black man. The waiter then continued that 2 months later, members of that White Supremacist faction were killed one-by-one and their crimes were exposed and it was revealed that an innocent man, via Alton, was lynched for no reason. The waiter then showed old images of Corbeau dawning the Crow garb accompanied by a raven and asked Tomlin, ""Do you believe in Ghosts?"" He then stated that after the thugs were killed, Corbeau vanished without a trace, never seen again. The waiter then laid down a piece of advice for Tomlin ""If you see someone who is supposed to be dead and is in the company of ravens, it means they won't be leaving this world until their business is finished here. Alton and his woman were killed for nothing."" The waiter then told Tomlin that Alton wasn't the first nor would he be that last and went on to reveal that he personally knew Sean and Hailey, claiming that their love for each other was pure, citing that the allegations made against Kraher were lies, pointing out Strout's eagerness to launch a mob effort into chasing the Kraher Family out of town. Tomlin then stated that if Sean didn't kill Hailey, he would have to prove it.

**Albie White**

Needing legit proof to connect Strout to the meth game, Sean needed to head to the City Office building to find the schematics for the Farm. He even attempted to contact Rupert but spoke to his brother, Sam, stating that he was heading to the City Office to find the blueprints. Upon arriving there, he was met by Albie White and a crew of Dixie thugs, who were waiting on him. They opened fire on him, but the bullet wounds immediately healed, and as the thugs were reloading, Sean drew a machete and a one-handed scythe and unleashed a bloodbath in the building. He saved White for last, remembering how he destroyed Hailey's tutu like it was no big deal the day of the murders. Sean then slashed Albie's legs and told him, ""She loved that outfit and you tore it from her, now I am going to tear something for YOU!!!"" Sean, with his machete and scythe, began flaying Albie's outer skin, creating a bloody mess, and decapitated White with the machete.

After the fight, Kraher found the schematics to the Farm, and that was when Sergeant Tomlin arrived to find him. Tomlin was surprised to see Sean walking among the living and revealed he never believed the rape and murder accusations against him. Sean then confirmed his suspicions as he tapped into his memory and revealed the truth of the murders. With newfound knowledge of the events, Tomlin was curious to know how they could prove any of this and Sean stated that a video was found and will be revealed once Strout and Mauser's crimes are brought to the light. Sean then revealed his information about the Farm just being a false front to run a meth operation for the Dixie Boys and the whole point of running his family out of Corvus County was to do away with his father who was bidding against Strout for the parcel of land so they ruined his family name by framing Sean for killing Hailey and killing him to make it look like Hailey was fighting back. He even pointed out the lack of farm animals, the delivery trucks, and the heightened security there. Knowing he could trust Tomlin, Kraher handed the schematics to Tomlin and as he was prepared to leave, Sean told Tomlin, ""When the smoke settles, you can have Strout, but Logan is mine! This ends now!""

**Logan, Nat, and Darren**

Arriving at the Farm, Kraher was immediately confronted by Logan Mauser, Nat Fowler, Darren Potts, and their entire gang during which Sam appeared, revealing his treachery and the fact that they pay well in which he handed Logan the Smartphone and the disc copy. Logan then threw both items to the ground and shot them with his shotgun, believing he has erased any evidence linking him to Sean and Hailey's death. They then captured the crow following Sean and injured it, rendering Sean vulnerable. Logan, Nat, Darren, and his crew started beating on Sean and rather than finish him off, Logan decided to take the Sean and the crow as a prize, during which he took the wounded bird to his office and placed pins in its wings and body. They then took Kraher through the meth lab in the metal building to their makeshift prison in which they strapped him to a chair and started wailing on him, realizing they didn't have to kill him, but would like to keep him alive and torment him further, knowing they didn't need to end it. As Logan berated Sean about the rape, calling it the greatest pleasure of his life, Sean then spoke about dropping a whole house on top of his brother, Cory. Logan then snapped and pummeled Sean. Logan then exited the room and contacted Strout about capturing Kraher and was ordered to finish him off, promising that once he's Sheriff, the Dixie Boys will have free reign in Corvus County. Rather than carry out Strout's kill command, Logan decided he would rather have a live trophy. As the guys left Sean to brood, Logan's girlfriend Ainsley appeared, covered in bruises from Logan's abuse, and began wiping blood from Sean's face. Sean realized that she, too, was a victim of Logan's torment and asked why she was still with him. Ainsley stated that Logan loved her and would take care of her, still pondering whether the rumors of Kraher were true. Kraher told her that the injuries she received on her face and body is not out of love and Logan only cared about himself. Sean then beseeched Ainsley to released the crow in Logan's office, encouraging her to do the right thing. After she left, Darren appeared and began taunting and hitting Kraher, and during that duration, all Sean could think about was the day of the murders when Darren used Sean as his whipping boy, and reflected on his past memories of Hailey when he was there for their happiest moments to her saddest moments and reminisced on her past ballet solos. Meanwhile, Ainsley made a hasty decision to break into Logan's office and free the crow that had pins in it. As she was removing the pins, Nat saw her and began attacking her with his fists, demanding to know what she was doing. Ainsley then slashed Nat in the face with one of the pins and started removing the final pins from the crow, freeing it and giving it time to heal. Sean soon realized that his wounds and strength were recovering, giving him the chance to break out of his bonds, and as Darren was about to land another hard slap, Kraher deflected it by grabbing Darren's wrist, snapping it with his grip, and threw Darren into a wall. Darren called for his men to take down Sean only for them to be slaughtered in the process in which Kraher proceeded to beating Darren and snapping his neck. Sean then grabbed Darren's phone in which he called Rupert and told him to ""Release the Video"".¬†*In a flashback, Sean witnessed Sam's deception as he made a deal with Logan via Raven vision, and even told Rupert to make two more copies of the video, encouraging Rupert never to let Sam know. He even bore witness through a crow that Sam tipped off Logan about Kraher heading to the City Office. During the meeting with Tomlin at the City Office, Kraher slipped one of Ruperts copied discs into Tomlin's pocket.*¬†Rupert soon released the video on social media, revealing to the world that Logan and Strout framed Sean for killing Hailey. Tomlin then found the disc on his person, and discovered he had the smoking gun to taking down Strout. Logan, just as he was about to pay Sam, immediately had a video pop up on his phone, revealing that he was the culprit in Sean and Hailey's murder. Logan accused Sam of trying to screw him and shot him in the head. Infuriated by the evidence that came to light, he decided it was time to skip town, but wanted to finish off Sean, refusing to let that moment slide. In the metal building, a newly-scarred Nat caught up to Ainsley and tried to beat her but Kraher appeared and threw him off of her and told Ainsley to ""Get away from this building as fast as possible. What I am about to do here, you don't want to be anywhere near this place."" and Ainsley made a run for it. Sean took the fight to the meth lab and unleashed a slaughter onto the guards inside the lab. Remembering how Nat physically assaulted Hailey the night of the murder, he gave Nat a dose of his own medicine with some brutality and aware there was flammable chemicals in the lab, Kraher lit a match and told Nat how he was about to experience his ""First Taste of Hell"" as he dropped the match into the chemicals, blowing up the building and engulfing Nat into flames. Logan, who was approaching the building, was knocked to the ground from the explosive backdraft, and watched as Sean exited the burning building unscathed. Sean glared at Logan, remembering how he was forced to watch him put Hailey through pure Hell as he raped her. Logan lashed out at Sean, declaring he would never accept a reality where he would lose and Sean would win. He then shot a crow near Kraher and fired upon Sean, who appeared unaffected. Logan was distraught, claiming he had just killed his crow and Kraher declared that he had a whole flock at his disposal the whole time. Sean then laid down an attack on Logan in which he broke both his legs and told him, ""The worst part about killing you, Logan... is that I can only do it once... So I'm gonna make this one count!"" Sean's eyes became hollow and foggy as Logan is viciously attacked and pecked by crows. Logan desperately attempted to fight off the crows pecking and clawing at him. Kraher then said, ""Tonight, there will be a feast for the Crows, and you, Logan, will be the carrion that will nourish them."" The flock began ripping Logan apart to the point of his death. His body was immediately unrecognizable after the crows finished him off. He then saw through the eyes of a crow which revealed Sergeant Tomlin leading a squad to arrest Strout, only to discover that Strout killed himself after seeing that the video was made public. Sean then pulled out Hailey's necklace with the ballerina pendant, apologizing for letting her see that.

Realizing his duty was fulfilled, he called his father to tell him that it was done and promised to see him one day. Shortly after Sean left the Farm, the Sheriffs Department swarmed the area and Ainsley was present to provide the deputies evidence tying Sergeant Strout and the Dixie Boys to the meth game. Sean then called Rupert to the Juniper Tree near the Arkansas that he and Hailey made their spot, thanking him personally for helping Sean clear his name. Sean then approached the tree where he placed the golden necklace with the ballerina pendant onto a branch and Hailey's spirit appeared. Astonished to see her again, Sean attempted to communicate with her via sign language to discover her new life has given her the sense to hear, and when asked how it was possible, Hailey told Sean that they ""Have an Eternity to talk about this."" Sean and Hailey kissed and found themselves in the Afterlife as Rupert watched with shock and awe as they vanished.

Four years have passed since the events that conspired. During that time, Sean and Hailey's murder case was reopened and closed after new evidence came to light, and the Dixie Boys Kansas Charter was brought down after evidence of their drug trade was discovered. Bill Tomlin is now elected Sheriff of Corvus County. Edmond Kraher and his family returned back to Corvus County now that their family name was restored, in which Uncle Bart and Aunt Daisy welcomed them back in open arms, and Edmond built a construction warehouse and manufacturing building on the land that used to be the Farm as originally intended. Ainsley Reagan started a food truck in the area and is dating someone far more supportive. Mark Edelmann and his family are now living in a nicer and bigger home compare to the one Kraher demolished while killing Cory. Ignacio and Lucia were finally at peace as they put aside their issues with Sean, knowing Hailey loved him, and even placed a photo of Sean and Hailey onto their mantle. As for Rupert Flemish, he finally has his film degree and is now operating a film studio in Van Nuys, California, making a film inspired by the events in Corvus County, Kansas. A journalist then approached Rupert about his project and when asked about the movie he was making, Rupert told her that the film was about a man and the woman he loved being killed under false circumstances, and the guy came back from the dead to right the wrongs committed against him and would not be able to move on until his task was completed. Rupert then stated many factors for the film which included love, family, betrayal, vengeance, and justice. The journalist saw the project as a possible super hero film, while also bringing up rumors about such a person appearing in his hometown. Rupert then told the journalist that the person she heard about wasn't the first nor will he be the last, claiming that somewhere out there, someone is being wronged and is having their world torn away in the blink of an eye and there are forces at work giving those individuals the opportunity to seek justice. Rupert then revealed that this film will disclose such an event. When the journalist asked Rupert what the name of the hero in the film was going to be, Rupert then noticed a crow landing on one of his sets in the studio and responded to the journalist by calling his project ""The Crow""!",2,1756214602.0,TheCrow,0,0.75,False

A few months ago, I had a gastroscopy because of stomach pain and acid reflux. It showed a small bleeding (mild gastritis) in my stomach, so I was put on pantoprazole (PPIs) for 6 weeks. It worked really well - but afterwards I‚Äôve had an incredibly hard time getting off the medication.

Every time I try, I get severe acid reflux (rebound effect). I‚Äôve already given up my beloved morning coffee, spicy food, alcohol, sweets, etc. But you also have to live a little, so once in a while I‚Äôve had a glass of wine with friends. But not very often.

I‚Äôve tried tapering slowly (every other day) and using over-the-counter medication for support - but it still doesn‚Äôt really work.

I really don‚Äôt want to be on pantoprazole permanently. So I‚Äôm wondering if any of you have experience with getting out of the pantoprazole trap? How did you do it?

Another example: drinks a shit ton of coffee every day, unhealthy amounts then surprised their hands are shaky and they're more anxious and so on. 

My dad is a good example: has been drinking coffee daily and smoking like a pack or more of cigarettes a day since he was like 12, now has blood pressure problems. You cant explain anything to him without him denying it has anything to do with cigs or coffee. 

But this isnt just about some kind of things they're consuming, this stretches to people not having basic ass logic on how the body works.

1n0loi4,https://i.redd.it/nr99o4jdxclf1.png,Take My Class: POLS1826D Everyday Political Theory,"Hi all. I am here to pitch you on my class and on me as an instructor. This is my first semester teaching at Brown, so I don't yet have the all-important, glowing ""critical review."" Instead of that, here are some pieces of info on me and the class. Please comment with any questions you have. I'll try to answer quickly as I know some of you are finalizing schedules. Of course, if you're still unsure about the class...please visit and check it out during the shopping period. 

Dr. Sam Schmitt, the Instructor: 

* I am high energy, very organized, love music, will learn your name on day 1, and be on your team for life once you take a class with me. I aim to be positive and constructive, pushing you to be a better student, colleague, and human.
   * I don't think it is cringe to be sincere and really love your work in a disciplined way.
   * I know you can learn a lot without suffering through a terrible instructor/course.
   * I have a substack about music. 
* I am an award-winning teacher. Top award for teaching at UNC-Chapel Hill. From the award citation: 
   * *\[Sam\] was described by a faculty member in his department as ‚Äúthe best teacher I have seen in a decade.‚Äù He demonstrates excellence in every category of instructional evaluation, and he inspires students to ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with political theory, providing them with tools to understand and analyze political theory.* Tanner Award for Teaching Citation
* My research combines normative philosophy with empirical social science research and institutional analysis to examine questions at the intersection of contemporary political theory, religion, and political economy.
* PhD Political Science, MA Philosophy. Currently a Postdoc at the Brown Center for Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.
* [Here's my Brown page](https://ppe.brown.edu/people/samuel-schmitt). Email me any questions you have or comment here.

The Class, Everyday Political Theory:

* Read the blurb. I designed this course from the ground up to be both intellectually stimulating and useful for students in all fields. A former student, now at a tier 1 PhD program, said she used the course material frequently when working for a nonprofit. This could be you.
* Student testimonies on the class:
   * *I really loved the group project embedded in this course. I also liked the Q&A sessions we had with Sam that integrated real life and political theory. Being someone who does not like politics or political discussions, I can honestly say that the structure and content of the course interested me and taught me about how to be a good citizen and member of society.* Student Evaluation, Everyday Political Theory
   * *A strength \[of Everyday Political Theory\] was trying to get us to think about this material and apply it to our everyday lives. Many poli sci courses use theories that aren‚Äôt personal or are removed from the individual, so this course was very different and challenging. Yet, it seems to have more daily and individual applications than many other philosophy and political theory courses.* Student Evaluation, Everyday Political Theory
* Course Ethic: 
   * I expect the highest standard of civil discourse and mutual respect from‚Äîand for‚Äîall members of our community. It is my aim to help you appraise and examine the various positions and ideas we encounter with intellectual charity, integrity, and rigor. To that end, I expect students to do business in the proper currency of intellectual discourse, a currency consisting of reasons, evidence, and arguments. In such an environment, it will be necessary for you to grow in respect and familiarity with one another, the world, and the corpus of human knowledge.
* Yes, there is a good amount of reading. No, I don't think you'll get as much out of a class that requires less from you. 
* NO REQUIRED TEXTBOOK. Just readings you'll need to print out. 
* Will I ban phones? Maybe I will. 
* Course involves significant group work--but don't worry, I have taught this course before and know how to incentivize good work from all group members. In fact, there's a section devoted to collective action where you design rules for your groups...and I must sign off on them. 
   * More importantly: group work is part of your future. It is important to figure out how to do it well. This class is a good way to do that.

Coffee's in the kettle, it's time to trade a pedal!

**TLDR**

I got:

- A bunch of unique handmade pedals: various fuzzes, Rat-based distortions, simple boosts/overdrives, envelope filters, compressors, and some oddball things.
  - New: Nerd Fuzz 8/25:  Another nerd fuzz build in a 125B, top jacks.  This is my general-purpose do-it-all fuzz.
  - New: Hippie Child Fuzz: HP-based fuzz with lots of controls, in a 1590BB.
  - New: Emerald box:  simple HP-based fuzz with NOS germanium transistor.  Housed in a steel jewelry box.
- Some 9V/12V practice amps I made from old speakers.  Varying sizes and sounds.
- A small handful of cheapies/mid-tiers from the usual suspects.
- Various guitar accessories (stand, tuner, picks, footstool)
- Some bulky items for local trade in the Nashville, TN area.

I want:

- Just about anything related to musical instruments and music making: Effects, instruments, gizmos, recording stuff, etc.
  - Looking for a Squier mini in particular, preferably pink, red, or daphne blue
- Also open to non-music-gear items.  Giftable handmade things, tools, electronics, game cartridges (see below) etc.
- That thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is.


**Section I: Stuff I have made myself**

*(If you are NOT into handmade stuff, skip to section II.)*

This is hand-built stuff that I made, mostly relatively unique or heavily tweaked designs.  Sometimes I have clones.

Please see [my FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/user/lykwydchykyn/comments/1fjxbps/handmade_pedals_faq/) about these pedals for more details.

I have them valued in 4 tiers:

- **C tier** are the **cheapies**.  I value these in the $55 - $65 range, not very picky here.
- **B tier** are my **average builds**, I will trade for pedals in the $65-$90 value range, depending on the complexity of the build.  A little pickier, but still pretty open.
- **A tier** are my **happy happy builds**, usually more complex or just nicer quality.  I will be picky about trades for these.  It's probably less about value here and more about how much I actually want the thing you have.  Think in the $90 - $130 range.

Sounds really good to me, I mostly just wanted to see what using a discrete op amp would do for a Rat.  Turns out it does something cool.  In a painted steel jewelry box. |
| Diamond Mickey | B+ | [PIC](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2kbhb) [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsPcb9KsoDA) | This is another Rodential Discretion Advised, but with Germanium transistors for extra mojo.  It's a bit more mellow Rat sound, but still a Rat.  If you like Rats at lower gain, this is great for you.  Housed in a reinforced Mickey Mouse tin. |
| The 99 Drive | B+ | [PIC](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2fxxs) [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIvZ-UJM6go) | Simple overdrive using a transistor boost into a JFET tube emulation (fetzer valve).

| SQ≈åSH | B+ | [PIC](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l18zp3) [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3RggfDKRMg) | BYOC optical compressor I refurbed and painted.  Sounds great!  Looks‚Ä¶ like it looks. |
| Oolong Notes (Compressor) | B+ | [PIC](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bfirnl)  [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=252rmTsPvjw) | Simple discrete transistor compressor circuit designed by another redditor (cassidy_is_asleep).  Gives a nice twangy squash, and breaks up in a pleasing way at the top of the dial. Not really like any conventional VCA-based compressor.  Housed in a reinforced tea tin. |

*Oddballs*

|Name|Tier|Links|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Little Saggy | C | [PIC](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1klunjz) | Battery drain simulator using an actual power regular chip (not just a pot in a box).  Takes your 9V power supply and puts out between 1.5ish and 8ish volts.  Try it with your fuzzes or drives for a truly sick sound.|


*Little Solid-State Amps*


| Name | Tier | Links | Description |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Ample iMank G2 | A | [PICS](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jhqh1y) [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO2LsVTDv1I) | Another amp built into an iMac-lookalike computer speaker.  This one uses a custom transistor preamp built on PCB with a class D power amp chip.  Very loud for it's size.  Low gain settings give a crisp punchy clean, high gain is a smooth bluesy tone.  Preamp output on the back if you want to run it into a different power amp or cab sim. |
| Ample iMank G2 #2 | A | [PICS](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jm449g) [Demo (same basic thing, different build)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO2LsVTDv1I) | Second build of the iMank G2, slighly different internals but electronically and externally the same. |
| Bluz xoB | B | [PICS](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdaza9)  [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TPcjBM3xYyA) | Battery-powered one-knob amp in metallic blue.  I stamped ""Box"" backwards and it looked awesome so it's the Bluz xoB.  Goes from squeaky clean to wildly fuzzed with one knob.  Not super loud, but super fun! |
| Nosy Amp | B | [PICS](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16r8a8s) [DEMO](https://youtu.be/LNUugrJl8i8) | Another solid-state amp based on the Ruby amplifier, housed in a repurposed bookshelf speaker.  This one actually has pretty decent volume, even on 9V (can run on 12V as well for more), and can stay clean while getting loud enough for a quiet jam with friends. |
| Tin Face Amp | B | [PICS](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iz09x6) [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl8VqUhcJX4) | This trashy little number delivers cranked-amp sound with more bass than you'd expect given it's size.  It doesn't do clean too well, but for a dirty blues or classic rock sound, it's great.  Can run on 9V or 12V, needs a 1amp PSU though.  Custom preamp design with a TDA2822 power amp. Loud enough for a living room jam, won't replace your gigging amp.|



**Section II: Stuff I did not make**

Make an offer.  I respect [Reverb Price Guide](https://reverb.com/price-guide) values for both sides of the trade.

*Pedals and electronics*

|Brand|Name|Condition|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Danelectro | Fab Chorus | Excellent (Box)| Cheap plastic chorus, but sounds great.  Probably just a make-weight, too cheap to trade on its own. |
| EHX | Qtron Micro | Good | Missing a rubber foot, otherwise fine condition.  |
| Kmise | Phaser | Very Good | Little mini phaser pedal, does the phaser thing.  Cheapie for make-weight I guess. |
| Marshall | MS-4 Ministack | Very Good | Cute desktop mini amp stack.  I like the amps I make better. |
| MOTU | MIDI express | Good | This is an antique MIDI patchbay and interface.  It's **pre-USB** and uses the parallel cable (PC) or some kind of Apple-specific DIN cable (Classic Mac).  Could be used standalone, or maybe you're into retro MIDI setups?   Comes with box and cables anyway. |
| Pigtronix | MS2 Mothership 2 synth pedal | Excellent | As usual, I fall for synth pedals and never use them.  Sigh.  I have an adapter for it since it requires 18v. |


*Accessories*

|Brand|Name|Condition|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| BOSS | TU-12H | Good | Crusty vintage tuner from Boss.  Still works great, but it's missing the outer case (still has the inner part).  If you had one in the day and want to relive the magic, feel free to make an offer. |
| Ernie Ball | Thin Guitar picks | New? | I have an uncountable number of thinnish red Ernie ball guitar picks that have been emblazoned with ""Montgomery Gentry Taylor"" on one side.  There's probably a few hundred.  They fill an 8.5in x1.75in cylindrical pokemon tin about 2/3 of the way full.  I'll include the tin.  It smells like Vaporub. I don't know why. |
| Fender | Mini folding guitar stand | Excellent | Folds up nice and compact. |
| Proline | Guitar footstool | Excellent | Foldable footstool for classical players. |
| Vic Firth | Stick bag with sticks | New? | Small stick bag with a couple brand new looking vic firth sticks.  Found second hand, but looks unused. |


*Local (Nashville TN area) ONLY*

This stuff is heavy and I don't want to ship it.

|Brand | Name | Condition | Notes |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| TEAC | A3340S 4-Track Reel-to-Reel | Good | Cleaned up, oiled up, and in good working order last time I tried it out.  Meant to do some analog recording, but just haven't gotten the time or space.  Would trade for a decent instrument of some kind.  Might even throw in a copy of Craig Anderton's ""Home Recording for Musicians"", which uses the same unit. Looking for something pretty special for this, no cheapie bundles.|
| Altec-Lansing | Power amp (9442A) | Fair | 300 W, 2 rack-unit power amp, can work in stereo or bridged mode.  Last time I used it one of the channels was a little flaky.  Couldn't be bothered to fix it myself.  Heavy as all get out, I'll sell for cheap if you're local.  |
| Mackie | 1202 mixer | Good | The really old pre-VLZ model, so it's small but chunky.  Recently serviced all the pots and jacks, it's in good shape for its age.|

**Section III: What would I trade for??**

Short answer: I'm generally wide open to trades for music gear of all kinds and other items of value.  There are some things I don't want, though.

Some Priority **Wants**:

  * Squier Mini.  Especially if it's in pink or daphne blue.
  * Midi keyboard controller with a built-in sequencer (Keystep 37?)
  * Digital Amp/Cab sim pedal.  Currently rocking a Nux amp academy, looking to try options.  Doesn't have to be high-end.
  * Better audio interface than my aged 1st Gen Scarlett 2i4.
  * Isolated pedal power supply.
  * A 1-U rack-mount mixer or power supply
  * Still looking for the right next-level looper.  Pigtronix?
  * Joyo American/California/AC Sound.  Want to practice modding them.
  * LONGSHOT:  a working LCD screen for a Korg Triton Rack or LE

Other things I'd likely trade for:

  * Pedals, naturally:
    * Fancy DSP type pedals (the kind I can't build).  Always interested in higher-end reverbs and delays.  Or lower end, hah!
    * Interesting mid-tier pedals from Boss, EHX, Walrus, EQD, etc.
    * Things that make playing alone at home more fun for a middle-aged guy whose band days are just a bittersweet memory.
    * Decent older analog, thru-hole pedals that need repair.  Expect a lot of questions and not much value, though.
    * Check ""probably not wants"" below
  * Studio gear like mics, headphones, cables, small mixers, rack gear, etc.
  * Synths and midi gear.  I'm low-key into grooveboxen right now.
  * Musical instruments?  I play about everything, or would like to try anyway.
    * Hand drums of decent quality -- A Cajon Majon electric would be awesome.  Or a Cajon beater pedal.
    * I'd like to acquire a tele style guitar or fretless bass at some point.  Even just a cheapie knockoff. Hello Harley Benton owners!
  * Also Non-music things:
    * Unbuilt pedal kits, pedal enclosures, bulk lots of electronics parts, etc.
    * Electronics/DIY tools or supplies (scope, transistor tester, solder, etc).
    * Something weird and creative.  Random items of modest value you want to get rid of.  Handmade items that are giftable.
    * Wii, NES, or SNES games. (only those systems).  Probably only for handmade stuff.  Will have to run these by my resident gamers for approval.

Probably **not wants**:

  * Dirt pedals, usually, except for repair/mod items or things I've noted in my wants.
  * Eurorack modules.  No room in my life for this, sadly.
  * Guitar/amp/cab parts.  Sadly I don't have room to work on (big) amps or guitars, just pedals.
  * Behringer plastic pedals.  Just not a fan. (Other Behringer products are OK)
  * Any pedal whose value is primarily as a collectible (Vintage, Rare editions/colorways/signature models, etc)
  * If I can get it on Amazon or Reverb for under $50, I'd rather we bundled a few things to make it worth the shipping cost.
  * Vinyl, trading cards, comic books, or other collectibles EXCEPT those explicitly stated as wants.

These beans are carefully selected at the source to ensure only the healthiest and ripest cherries are used. Farms comply with organic standards, avoiding the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can contribute to mold growth.

**Roasting Process:** The roasting process is critical in neutralizing potential mycotoxins. Specialized roasting profiles are employed to reach specific bean temperatures that effectively eliminate mold without compromising the coffee's flavor profile. This involves precise temperature control and continuous monitoring to guarantee optimal results.

**Testing & Certification:** Rigorous testing is conducted throughout the entire production chain. Beans are tested for common mycotoxins, such as ochratoxin A and aflatoxin B1, by third-party laboratories using advanced analytical methods. Certifications, such as USDA organic and Fair Trade, further ensure compliance with quality and ethical standards.

**Packaging:** Packaging plays a vital role in maintaining freshness and preventing contamination during storage and transit.Bags are typically constructed from multi-layered materials with one-way degassing valves to prevent oxidation and preserve the coffee's aroma. Nitrogen flushing is often used to displace oxygen within the bag, further enhancing shelf life.

**Grinding (If Applicable):** Some brands offer pre-ground options using industrial-grade grinders calibrated to produce uniform particle sizes. This ensures consistent extraction during brewing, optimizing flavor and minimizing the risk of channeling.Bur grinders are preferred over blade grinders as they generate less heat, preserving the bean's essential oils.

Not the four wheel mini box van ones either! Once was when I was stopped at a red light in a bike lane and a courier on a loaded cargo bike tried to run the red light and squeeze past from behind at speed, clipping the back of my bike and pushing me over.

And just yesterday, coming through Angel lock on my boat, I can see someone locking a juggernaut of a cargo bike to the handrails of the lock ladder above me. Pretty dangerous, it‚Äôs a vertical ladder out of the lock, and you need to be able to step onto the bank. Shouted at him from down below but he didn‚Äôt hear. 

Climbed the ladder, angrily clambered over the ‚Äòbike‚Äô dickhead had locked to the handrail, ropes immediately got tangled in it. Dickhead was ordering a coffee in the cafe opposite and ran out shouting at me not to damage his bike. Told him (in nicer terms!) that it‚Äôs a cockwomble move to lock it there as makes access down the ladder difficult and dangerous. He said it was fine, and stormed off. 

Opened the lock gates and had to go back down the ladder onto the boat, which meant climbing over the damn thing with a rope in my hand again. This time I lost my balance and trod on something near the chain which crunched expensively and fell into the water, so he came out shouting again. Explained to him again that he‚Äôd locked it to a ladder, he made a scene, more words were exchanged and eventually he unlocked it.

  I've been talking to this girl from work for a few weeks now. Things seemed to be going well - we grab coffee, text throughout the day, she laughs at my jokes. You know, all the good signs. But then yesterday she seemed distant and I couldn't figure out why.

So naturally, I did what any rational person would do at 11 PM - I asked ChatGPT what went wrong.

 I laid out the whole situation. Told it about our conversations, how she'd been responding differently, the whole timeline. I was expecting some generic advice about communication or whatever.

Instead, ChatGPT asks me: ""In your last few conversations with her, how often did you ask about her day versus telling her about yours?""

 I started thinking back and... oh no.

It then asked: ""When she mentioned her presentation at work, did you follow up on how it went?""

I hadn't. I completely forgot she even had a presentation.

""When she said she was stressed about her sister's situation, what did you say?""

I think I just said ""that sucks"" and changed the subject to something about my weekend plans.

ChatGPT didn't even need to spell it out. I realised I'd been so focused on impressing her that I forgot to actually  care about her as a person. I was basically having a conversation with myself and she just happened to be there.

The crazy part? I texted her this morning asking about her presentation and how her sister was doing. She immediately  perked up and we had the best conversation we've had in weeks.

 I can't believe an AI had to teach me how to be a decent human being in a relationship. But honestly? Best advice I've ever gotten.

I‚Äôll admit, I got my hands on this powerhouse setup out of sheer curiosity, and let me tell you, it‚Äôs been a wild ride from unboxing day to countless movie marathons. Between the Dolby Atmos support, the 10-inch subwoofer, and its sleek design, there‚Äôs so much to unpack (figuratively and literally) about this sound bar system.

**Premium Design Meets Functionality**  
Right out of the box, the design of this home audio bundle stood out. The sound bar has this minimalist yet modern aesthetic, perfect for blending into any living room setup without screaming for attention. That said, what surprised me the most is how compact the subwoofer is despite the crazy bass performance it promises. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call a space-saver with attitude. My living room isn‚Äôt exactly sprawling, but the sleek build fit right under my TV setup, and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was compromising on style or setup efficiency.

**Positives**  
- Dolby Atmos support: Immersive soundscapes make you feel like you‚Äôre living inside your movie scenes.  
- Compact subwoofer with huge bass output: Perfect for small to medium spaces without swallowing your living area.  
- Sleek design and finish: Fits effortlessly into any audiovisual setup without looking bulky.  

[Check Klipsch Flexus CORE 200 Sound Bar Bundle price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b0d3zzgwb9/)

**Audio Quality & Performance**  
This is where things got really interesting. Paired with Dolby Atmos, the sound clarity and surround experience threw me off in the best way possible. Whether it was dialogue-heavy dramas or action-packed blockbusters with booming explosions, the 3.1.2-channel audio hit all the right notes and then some. Very few sound bars I‚Äôve tested over the years manage to create that upward-firing sound so seamlessly. The bass? Chef‚Äôs kiss. The subwoofer packs a punch, and on more than one occasion, I found my coffee mug jiggling on the table. For music lovers like my brother (he tested this with his favorite orchestral playlist), the rich lows and crisp highs were a dream combo.

**Key Benefits**  
- Handles complex audio with ease, from quiet whispers to loud cinematic booms.  
- High-excursion paper cone woofer ensures deep, impactful bass.  
- Proprietary Klipsch Transport technology keeps everything seamlessly connected.  

**User Friendliness & Connectivity**  
Setting up this sound bar bundle wasn‚Äôt rocket science, even for someone like me who pretends to read instructions but rarely does. The Klipsch Transport technology deserves some applause here ‚Äì pairing the sound bar, subwoofer, and other components was quicker than making a cup of instant coffee. Throw in multiple connection options (I used the HDMI ARC for my setup), and you‚Äôve got a system that pretty much adapts to all kinds of modern devices. One nitpick? It didn‚Äôt play as nicely with my older TV model, but in fairness, this was an upgrade overdue anyway.

**Possible Weaknesses**  
- Doesn‚Äôt pair well with older devices, so tech upgrades might be needed.  
- Slight adjustment period for optimal sound settings.  

**How It Stacks Against Product Contenders**  
Compared to sound bar systems like the Samsung HW-Q950A or Bose Smart Soundbar 900, the Klipsch Flexus CORE 200 definitely delivers an edge when it comes to that deep, bone-rattling bass. However, Bose does take the crown for clean and natural dialogue processing. The Samsung system, on the other hand, offers broader connectivity options for those who like to juggle multiple devices. On affordability, though, Klipsch wins by a noticeable margin, especially considering the subwoofer inclusion and Dolby Atmos support. It‚Äôs a compelling offering if you‚Äôre leaning toward more cinematic bite over redundant bells and whistles.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
Price often makes or breaks products like these. Here‚Äôs the thing: given the premium materials, stellar sound performance, and ease of setup, this sound bar bundle punches significantly above its price-to-quality ratio. You could easily drop more cash on a product delivering similar bass and Atmos quality. If ‚Äúaffordable luxury‚Äù were a product category, this would fit snugly in there. And from someone who treats home theater systems as their second religion, the investment more than justified itself after the first weekend binge-watch session.

Organizar una reuni√≥n de trabajo puede parecer sencillo, pero elegir el lugar adecuado es clave para que el encuentro sea un √©xito. Madrid, como capital empresarial de Espa√±a, ofrece una amplia variedad de espacios pensados para profesionales y compa√±√≠as de todos los tama√±os. Por eso, el alquiler de¬†[salas de reuni√≥n en Madrid](https://ibercenter.com/servicios/alquiler-salas/salas-de-reuniones/)¬†se ha convertido en una soluci√≥n pr√°ctica para quienes buscan comodidad, buena ubicaci√≥n y un entorno profesional.

# La importancia de la localizaci√≥n

El primer factor que debes considerar es la ubicaci√≥n. Muchas empresas buscan espacios en zonas c√©ntricas como la Gran V√≠a, Castellana o el barrio de Salamanca, por su cercan√≠a a √°reas financieras y comerciales. Otros prefieren salas pr√≥ximas al aeropuerto o a estaciones de tren para facilitar la asistencia de participantes que vienen de fuera de la ciudad. En cualquier caso, las¬†[salas de reuni√≥n en Madrid](https://ibercenter.com/servicios/alquiler-salas/salas-de-reuniones/)¬†ofrecen opciones bien comunicadas y accesibles.

# Equipamiento tecnol√≥gico

En la era digital, las reuniones requieren mucho m√°s que una mesa y sillas. La mayor√≠a de salas est√°n equipadas con proyectores, pantallas de alta resoluci√≥n, conexi√≥n Wi-Fi r√°pida, sistemas de sonido y equipos de videoconferencia. Esto permite que los encuentros sean m√°s din√°micos y que puedan participar asistentes en remoto sin problemas t√©cnicos.

# Flexibilidad horaria y de espacios

Una gran ventaja de alquilar salas externas es la flexibilidad. Puedes reservar por horas, medias jornadas o d√≠as completos, lo que supone un ahorro frente a mantener espacios propios infrautilizados. Adem√°s, muchos centros ofrecen salas modulables que se adaptan a diferentes formatos: desde una entrevista individual hasta un taller con decenas de asistentes.

# Servicios adicionales

M√°s all√° del espacio f√≠sico, muchos centros en Madrid ponen a disposici√≥n servicios que marcan la diferencia: recepci√≥n de visitas, catering, coffee breaks, traducci√≥n simult√°nea o personal de apoyo t√©cnico. Estos extras ayudan a que la reuni√≥n fluya y que los organizadores se centren √∫nicamente en los objetivos del encuentro.

# Profesionalidad e imagen de marca

Celebrar una reuni√≥n en un entorno moderno, elegante y bien preparado transmite una imagen positiva ante clientes y colaboradores. Para una startup que quiere impresionar a un inversor, o para una empresa consolidada que busca cerrar acuerdos estrat√©gicos, el espacio elegido puede influir directamente en el resultado.

# Conclusi√≥n

En definitiva, las¬†**salas de reuni√≥n en Madrid**¬†son una opci√≥n pr√°ctica y vers√°til que se adapta a cualquier necesidad profesional.

This sub tends to dwell on the negative aspects of dating and that‚Äôs typically how dating works generally. 

I have a quick, positive story to share. 

I was at a coffee shop yesterday working and I kept looking at this super cute woman that I knew from somewhere but I couldn‚Äôt quite remember exactly from where. I had already been there for a few hours when she walked in. 

I had to go to a doctor‚Äôs appointment so I eventually left and was kinda pissed at myself for not saying anything to her. 

After I left the doctor‚Äôs office I knew I still had some work to do so I went back to the coffee shop hoping she was still there. Lo and behold she was‚Ä¶ 

I made eye contact with her, gave a friendly smile and sat at a nearby table to work. About an hour later she gets up to leave. 

I walked over to her, told her I thought she was pretty and told her I would love to take her out sometime. I slipped her my number (I pre wrote my name and number on a piece of paper) to avoid the awkwardness of standing there waiting for her to give me her number. Plus it puts less pressure on her to give it to me and doesn‚Äôt take away her agency to wait and decide if she was interested. 

She thanked me for the compliment and said it was a sweet gesture. I introduced myself, she smiled and introduced herself as well (always a good sign IMO), I wished her a nice day and walked away confidently. 

Not sure if she‚Äôs going to reach out, but it‚Äôs a worthwhile story to share with the hope that someone out there may be able to take that leap of faith and approach someone in public rather than sit behind a screen on a dating app hoping for a match lol

1n0l5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CarAccomplished5447/comments/1n0l5ty/how_often_should_you_really_wash_your_quilts_a/,How often should you really wash your quilts? A Guide to Loving and Washing Your Quilts,"There‚Äôs a question that drifts into our minds, usually right before we haul our bedding to the laundry room:

**‚ÄúAm I washing this quilt too much? Or not enough?‚Äù**

You might be searching for a magic number, a rule to put in your calendar. But the real story of how to care for your quilt isn't found in a schedule, it‚Äôs found in its seams, its feel, and its very spirit.

Think of your quilt less like a simple blanket and more like a cherished friend. The secret to keeping it happy and beautiful for years isn't about rigid rules. It's about getting to know its personality, the fabric it's dressed in, the filling that gives it warmth, and the stitches that hold its story together.

# So, How Often Should We Wash It?

Let's start with a gentle guideline. For a quilt that's a part of your daily life, washing it **four to six times a year** is a good rhythm. If you use a top sheet / flat sheet between you and your quilt (like a trusty shield!), you can go even longer.

The best rule of thumb is simply to trust your senses. When it‚Äôs no longer fresh, or after an accidental coffee spill, it‚Äôs time for a bath. Remember, washing too often can be tough on any textile, so a little restraint goes a long way.

But this is where the story gets interesting. The *how* you wash is far more important than the *how often,* and it all begins with understanding what your quilt is made of.

# Getting to Know Your Quilt from the Inside Out

Every quilt has a unique character defined by its three core elements.

# 1. The Heart of the Matter: The Filling

The filling is your quilt's soul - it dictates how it breathes, hugs you back, and ages over time.

* **Cotton Filling:** Imagine a material that breathes with you. That's cotton. It‚Äôs a natural fiber that lets air circulate, keeping you just right. And here‚Äôs the best part: it can be revived when it looses it fluffiness as with each wash cotton-filled quilt settle into itself, the top cover and the filling tends to get more integrated. It‚Äôs a choice for comfort that lasts.  
* **Polyester Filling:** This synthetic filler is lightweight and bouncier, but it doesn't breathe in the same way. Over time, it‚Äôs prone to clumping. It just doesn't have that beautiful aging process that makes a natural quilt feel like an heirloom and most importantly cant be revived to continuous use.

# 2. The Unsung Hero: The Stitching

The stitches are the quiet heroes of your quilt's story. More than just decoration, a pattern of stitching is a sign of true quality and also defines its usage.

At [VLiving](https://vliving.in/), we see stitching as the framework that gives a quilt its strength and helps hold the filling and its cover together. It keeps the soft cotton filling from wandering, ensuring everything stays smooth and even, wash after wash.

This is also where a little bit of magic happens. After a wash, a quality cotton quilt doesn't just get clean - it transforms. It develops a soft, crinkled texture, a gentle 'pucker' that adds depth and a cozy, lived-in feeling. This isn't a flaw; it's a feature - the beautiful hallmark of a quilt that‚Äôs truly settling in. It's a texture that polyester quilts can only dream of.



# 3. The Outer Shell: The Fabric

The fabric is the first thing you touch, the quilt‚Äôs welcoming handshake. A soft, durable cotton exterior is like a good pair of jeans - it‚Äôs strong, comfortable, and only gets better and softer with every use and wash.

# A Special Chapter for Kantha Quilts

A Kantha is more than a quilt; it's a tapestry of stories. Traditionally born from layers of soft, repurposed cotton, each piece is held together by the iconic 'kantha' running stitch. There's no separate filling here - the layers of fabric themselves provide a gentle, breathable warmth.

* **Handle with Heart:** Think of it as a treasured heirloom. Hand-washing in a tub of cold water with a mild soap is always the kindest option. If you must use a machine, treat it to a solo trip in a large mesh bag in a cold-water cycle.  
* **Let it Breathe Dry:** The very best way to dry it is to let it air-dry naturally, laid flat or hung away. Skip the tumble dryer, or if you must, use only the no-heat, air-fluff setting.  

# The Simple Art of the Wash

Ready to give your quilt a spa day? Here‚Äôs how to do it with love.

1. **A Quick Health Check:** Before its bath, look over your quilt for any loose threads and give them a quick snip or stitch.  
2. **The Right Environment:** A large, front-loading washer is your quilt‚Äôs best friend because it tumbles gently. If you have a top-loader, choose the gentle cycle to be kind to the seams.  
3. **Gentle Suds:** Use a mild, eco-friendly detergent and stick to cold water. It‚Äôs better for your quilt and the planet.  
4. **Drying with Patience:** Tumble dry on the low heat setting or even better, a no-heat setting. Pop in a few wool dryer balls to fluff it up and help it dry more evenly. Pause the cycle every half hour or so to shake it out and say hello. The golden rule? Make sure it's completely dry deep down to its cottony core to prevent any hint of mildew. If you feel any dampness, let it air-dry for a few more hours.

# A Quilt Is a Sustainable Choice

When you care for a well-made quilt, you're doing more than just cleaning. You're participating in a cycle of sustainability. Choosing a piece made from natural materials and built with strong stitching is an investment.

By washing it thoughtfully, you‚Äôre not only preserving its beauty but also living a little more gently on the earth. A quilt is meant to be a part of your life's backdrop - to be wrapped around you on a chilly evening, to be a soft place to land. It's built to last, designed to be loved, and destined to gather stories and character with every single wash.

I was in a local cafe in town trying to get some work done. It's the last week of the school holidays so it was absolutely heaving.

I'd managed to grab the only free table, which unfortunately was a four-seater. I felt a bit bad but there was literally nowhere else to sit. I bought my coffee and a slice of cake and got my laptop out. About ten minutes later, this woman (let's call her EM) comes over with two young kids in tow.

She didn't say hello, just ""Excuse me, you're going to have to move.""

I was a bit taken aback. ""Oh, sorry, is there a problem?""

She pointed at my table. ""Yes, this is a four-person table and you're one person. We need it. There are three of us.""

I had a look around for her. ""I'm sorry, but there aren't any other tables free. I did look. As soon as a smaller one opens up I'll happily move."" I thought that was a fair offer.

Apparently not. She actually scoffed. ""That's not good enough. My kids are tired and hungry. They need to sit down now. You're just on your laptop, that's not important. We need to eat.""

Her kids were starting to whine and she was giving me a proper death stare. I was getting really uncomfortable but I just said, ""Look, I'm a paying customer just like you. I'm not moving until another table is free.""

This is when she properly kicked off. She huffed loudly and said, ""This is unbelievable! The selfishness of some people!"" Then she marched up to the counter to complain to the young lad working there.

I couldn't hear everything but I saw her pointing at me and the lad just shaking his head. He then came over and I was expecting him to ask me to move, but he just leaned in and said quietly, ""Sorry about that, you're fine where you are. Just ignore her"". He then went back to the EM and told her he couldn't force a customer to move and that she'd have to wait.

She grabbed her kids' hands, muttered something about ""never coming here again"" and stormed out, knocking a menu stand over on her way. The best part was a two-seater table had literally just opened up as she was leaving.

Within the last year, she has stopped playing games and started focusing on her life, and I am happy for her, she is doing much better and much happier.

However, it's starting to feel like there's more and more of a distance between us since now she is so busy with work, working 80 hour work weeks. She is the avoidant type when she gets overwhelmed, which is totally fine, but I'm missing my friend and want to try to reconnect with her.

We spoke a lot during our few years as friends, almost every day, talked about anything and everything under the sun, so I know almost everything about her life and her with mine. So lately, like, I know what she's going through, she's busy and overwhelmed and doesn't have time to herself and has literally 0 energy to text, and she's expressed how exhausted and overwhelmed she is. So I feel bad wanting more connection with her, because I don't want to put any pressure on her to connect.

I miss our chit chat sessions where we'd talk about anything, but now it feels like, when I go to reach out, I'm like, what would I even say? I know what's going on, I know what she's struggling with, I feel like there's not much to catch up on because we just know so much about each other we don't need to catch up to know what's going on, if that makes sense?

And I feel bad just texting her to text because she has a super low social battery recently so I don't want to text her to chat and then her feel guilty because she has no bandwidth to chat but also doesn't want to leave me hanging. I'm not pressuring her at all, but I know she has no effort to talk and I don't want her to feel bad for feeling like she can't, so I've been avoiding texting her because I don't want to put her in that situation.

But, despite knowing almost everything about each other, it feels like we're still so distant, we live in two different states, so I can't ask for a coffee meetup every month or so, unfortunately.

I know our friendship isn't fading/lost because we do still talk occasionally, and I know she's always there if I need her and vice versa, and we're just in the quality not quantity conversation stage.

But yea, idk, what can I do, if anything? Or what can I do to help feel secure in the silence? She doesn't make an effort to reach out to me, and I know a lot of people see that as a red flag, but she has always been that way, and I don't take offense to it, she genuinely just is someone who is rarely on her phone, but when we do have convos she is engaged, I don't hold it against her, because she is genuinely just so busy and so low bandwidth right now, and yea, like I mentioned before, it just feels like there's nothing to talk about with her, but I do want to talk with her and feel reconnected again

TLDR: I have this very busy and currently overworked and overwhelmed online friend, I want to feel more connected, but I don't want to add to her stress by making her feel like she has to text/hold a conversation. How can I offer support and still feel connected and engage with her when she's going through a rough patch like this?",2,1756212806.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

THE ONES I COULD‚ÄôVE BEEN


Night still clung to the condo.

The city outside buzzed faintly, but here, on the 5th th floor, it felt like the air belonged only to him.

Bastien stood alone, breath heavy, ribs aching with the afterglow of too many days without release. 

Not the kind his body begged for in idle hours, but the sacred kind.

The Archive was stirring again, whispering at the seam beneath his ribs, demanding birth.

It wasn‚Äôt indulgence. 
It was necessity.

If he didn‚Äôt summon, the pressure would tear him from the inside.

He lit no candles. 
He needed no music. 

The condo itself thrummed with resonance, walls alive with glyphs that pulsed in time with his chest.

Bastien exhaled, long and low.

His cock was already full, weighty, blood-rich. 

He knew what came next. 
What always came next.

‚ÄúPour le travail sacr√©,‚Äù he whispered.

For the sacred work.

He stripped the last of his clothes, knees bending onto the velvet rug at the condo‚Äôs heart.

His hand closed slow around himself, stroking not from fantasy, not from hunger,
but alignment.

The seam beneath his ribs flared.
And the ritual began.

The seam unzipped with a hiss of light. 

From armpit to hip it spread, glowing like dawn through a crack in the world. 

His body arched, a moan pulled deep from his ribs.

And then, he split.

A thigh, slick with sweat and light, slid out of him like silk skin peeled from its twin. 

A ribcage pressed. 
A shoulder curved.

Then a whole body, radiant and wet with birth-glow, butterflied from his side.

Deux.

Not crawling, not reaching.
Already tangled with him.

Already gripping his cock, stroking in rhythm as if he‚Äôd been there all along.

The seam pulsed again.

Bastien‚Äôs hips bucked. 

The light opened wider.

Another body spilled through, sliding free of him like a sculpture cut from heat.

Trois.

And his hand was not idle, it was already wrapped around Deux‚Äôs shaft, jerking him off as Deux stroked Bastien. 

A chain.

The seam burned hotter. 

Bastien gasped. 

Sweat rolled down his sternum.
Another groan, another unzip of golden light,

Quatre.

He tumbled out laughing, tangled legs wrapping both Deux and Trois, his hand gripping Bastien‚Äôs shaft just above Deux‚Äôs this time.

Four identical cocks stroked, thick and swollen, four hands pumping, slick with sweat and pre-cum.

The room was electric, and smelled of sex and ozone. 

Sacred. 
Charged.

The last seam split, glowing blinding light now.

Cinq.

He slid out smooth, like a panther born mid-stretch, already his hand wrapped around Quatre‚Äôs cock while his other hand was now gripped around Bastien‚Äôs base. 

He smirked, stroking with perfect rhythm as though he‚Äôd rehearsed it for centuries.

Five bodies. 
One circuit.

Each cock in another‚Äôs hand.
Each breath synced.

Each moan feeding the next.

They came together, literally and metaphysically.

Light. 
Pulse. 
Semen. 

Breath. 

Ignition flooding across skin and tile.

The orgasm wasn‚Äôt just release.

It was birth. 
Sacred ignition.

The glow dimmed slowly. 

Their chests rose together. 
Their legs were still tangled.

Their hands slid free one by one.

And when silence returned, Bastien stood. 

Sweat cooling, cock soft but glowing with aftercurrent.

Four reflections mirrored him.

Bare-chested. 

Alive. 

Still humming with resonance.

‚ÄúChrist d‚Äô√©pais,‚Äù Bastien muttered, wiping a sheen of cum from his hip with a hand towel.

‚ÄúJ√©sus, bande d'enfoir√©s... vous finissez plus dur que moi.‚Äù
(Jesus, you fuckers‚Ä¶ you finish harder than me.)

‚Äú‚ÄôCause we‚Äôre pure rhythm,‚Äù Trois called out, laughing, still sprawled bare-ass on the sheepskin throw. 

‚ÄúAll juice, no filter.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you bring us forth in heat,‚Äù Deux said gently, eyes still shut. 

‚ÄúWe emerge where you burn brightest.‚Äù

‚ÄúMerde,‚Äù Quatre said, glancing toward the door. 

Bastien‚Äôs chest heaved, sweat cooling, the room still charged with the thick tang of ozone and seed.

He wiped his ribs, heart pounding, and for a beat he thought - I should clean this place, open the windows, reset the air.

Too late. 

The knock came. 

Three sharp raps.

Not rushed. 
Not timid.

They all froze.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him.‚Äù

Kai.

Trois dove behind the couch, grabbing a towel and dragging it clumsily across his groin.

Deux stood calmly, exhaling as he vanished down the hallway like smoke.

Quatre gave one slow nod, disappeared into the guest bath.

Bastien snatched the same hand towel the echos had used, wiping fast - under his cock, across his palms, around his wrists.

The same towel they'd used and cleaned a dozen times before.

He tossed it toward the hamper.

Didn‚Äôt notice the small pearl still hanging on his knuckle.

He opened the door.

Kai.

Linen shirt, chest half unbuttoned, dark slacks pressed razor-sharp, skin sunlit even in shadow. 

Something timeless behind the eyes.

Bastien‚Äôs heart kicked like it always did around him.

They shook hands.
And the universe shifted.

Bastien had opened the door expecting to feel proud, relaxed, maybe even smug. 

He‚Äôd just cum hard enough to split dimensions. 

His body still glowed from it. 
His pants still heavy with proof.

Kai stepped in, linen shirt half-open, pressed slacks sharp, skin golden even in shadow. 

Bastien‚Äôs chest tightened.

He reached out, warm and easy, their palms clasping like brothers.

The handshake carried more than heat.

Bastien didn‚Äôt see the faint pearl of cum still clinging to his knuckle. 

It pressed into Kai‚Äôs palm as they gripped.

Kai‚Äôs body reacted before his mind did.

A subtle charge. 

His cock twitched, thickening.

Confusion flared. 

The air felt damp, electric.

Without thinking, he lifted his hand, brushed under his nose.

The trace smeared just beneath his lip.

The scent bloomed.

Salt.
Metal.
Skin.
Alive.

Instinctively, he licked his lips.

Just a nervous tick, barely conscious.

His cock swelled, urgent, but it wasn‚Äôt lust that drove it, it was confusion.

Kai was visibly aroused, though not in the way anyone would expect.

He didn‚Äôt understand it.

Couldn‚Äôt.

His body moved faster than his mind, betraying him, answering a signal he couldn‚Äôt even name.

And that was enough.

The taste struck him.

Warm. 

Metallic. 
Saline. 

Sweet.

A pulse of life on his tongue.

Kai stiffened. 

His pupils narrowed. 
His chest rose too fast.

The Archive surged in him, wet, electric, undeniable.

Bastien only grinned, mistaking it for his presence.

‚ÄúTabarnak, mon gars,‚Äù he chuckled, glancing down at the hard line in Kai‚Äôs pants. 

‚ÄúYou gettin‚Äô hard just shakin‚Äô my hand?‚Äù

Kai didn‚Äôt move. 
He was already hard. 

Thick in his pants. 

Full. 

Not because of desire, at least, not that kind. 

But because the Archive was speaking.

Through the scent.
Through the touch.

Through cum.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Bastien added, eyes flicking casually to the front of Kai‚Äôs slacks. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, bro. 
I get that too. 
You built like me, hein? 

Big guys don‚Äôt hide well.‚Äù

Then the tap.

‚ÄúThat brotherly, confident, utterly inappropriate Bastien tap, two fingers, a subtle nudge lifting the weight of Kai‚Äôs girth.‚Äù

‚ÄúRespect,‚Äù he grinned. 

‚ÄúLet ‚Äôem know what you got.‚Äù

Kai froze. 

His cock jerked under the touch, swelling harder against the fabric. 

Heat flushed through him so fast it made his vision blur. 

He didn‚Äôt understand why his throat felt tight, why his chest rose too quick, why the taste on his lips seemed to thrum all the way down into his groin.

He should have laughed it off, maybe even tapped Bastien‚Äôs bulge back the way guys sometimes did, turning it into a joke. 

The thought flashed hot and reckless, but he froze. 

Because he didn‚Äôt know why he was hard. 

Didn‚Äôt know why his own cock pulsed so heavy while his eyes caught, for just a second, the weight straining Bastien‚Äôs pants forward.

Instead, his body betrayed him, rooted to the spot, skin hot, cock throbbing against the press of those two fingers.

He swallowed the metallic-sweet taste still blooming in his mouth and nodded stiffly, wide-eyed, utterly at a loss.

Inside the condo, the scent hung thick.

Not dirty, but ancient.

Like something ritual had touched.

Sweat and cedar.
Clove.

Bastien‚Äôs cologne.
And something else.

Kai‚Äôs senses flared.

His skin prickled.
His pulse stuttered.

He felt more than one heartbeat.

And then - 

The Echoes emerged.

Dressed now, or at least partially. But that wasn‚Äôt what froze him.

It was their faces.

Not strangers. 
Not twins.

Bastien.

Four of him.

The same wide shoulders.
The same curl of hair falling across the brow.

The same weight in the chest, the same presence that filled a room.

But each one moved differently, stood differently, like a chord broken into notes.

Kai‚Äôs mouth went dry. 

His body reacted before his mind caught up.

Shock, yes.

But layered with something else, something primal.

It wasn‚Äôt just seeing Bastien four times over.

It was the impossible recognition, the way each set of eyes seemed to already know him, to claim him.

His cock pulsed hard in his slacks, and Kai‚Äôs throat bobbed with a swallow.

He couldn‚Äôt look away.

Deux -- The Philosopher Flame

Dressed in slate linen pants, no shirt, a crystal of labradorite hanging from his neck. 

His posture was regal without trying, his body a temple of calm muscle and inward fire.

‚ÄúYou shine in places others fear to look,‚Äù Deux said, stepping forward. 

His voice was slower than Bastien‚Äôs. 

Lower. 

Like midnight thinking.

Kai felt the truth in it.

‚ÄúYou feel it, non?‚Äù 
Deux said. 

‚ÄúThat we‚Äôve been near you before. 

We just wore different names.‚Äù

His hand brushed Kai‚Äôs shoulder.
There was nothing sexual in it.

But Kai‚Äôs cock throbbed again.

Because his body wasn‚Äôt just reacting to touch.

It was reading.

The Archive ran through him like a tuning fork, and the frequencies pouring off Deux lit him up from the inside.

The cum Bastien carried wasn‚Äôt just release, it was code. 

And Kai‚Äôs body, without him even knowing how, translated it.

Every brush of skin.
Every trace of scent.

Every pulse of resonance in the air.

His system absorbed it all.
His nerves answered in flesh.

He was feeling more than presence.

He was feeling timelines.

Futures.
Unlived lives.

Deux bowed slightly, then stepped back.


Trois ‚Äî The Pulse

Basketball shorts, hoodie open, gold chain heavy.

He moved like a boxer with a dancer‚Äôs bounce, loose and easy.

The fabric of his shorts didn‚Äôt bother to hide much; every shift of his hips made the weight behind them sway.

He adjusted himself casually, the way athletes did, with no shame at all, like his body was just another part of the conversation.

‚ÄúYo, you want a beer?‚Äù he asked, already tossing one with a grin.

‚ÄúWe just finished a workout session. 

Sort of.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou smoke?‚Äù he added, lighting a fat joint with a smile that could melt drywall.

‚ÄúOnly sacred things though.
 
Promise,‚Äù he said.

He leaned back against the counter, smoke curling around his head. 

The air near him carried a different heat, musk and sweat laced with cedar, something primal.

Kai caught it, sharp in his senses. 

Not foul. 
Not overwhelming. 

Just alive.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not copies,‚Äù Trois said, voice smooth.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the versions of Bastien he never had time to be.

And we like being alive.‚Äù

Quatre -- The Guard

Combat boots, utility pants, no shirt. 

His body was cut in angles. 

He looked like he belonged in a war film. 

A line of ritual scars crossed his chest like constellations. 

His stare was cold, but it held a strange familiarity.

He didn‚Äôt speak.
Just nodded once.

Kai understood.

Bastien stood near the kitchen island, arms crossed.

Watching.
Waiting.

Nervous -- but proud.

‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ yeah,‚Äù he said finally, voice rougher than he meant.

‚ÄúI jerked off. 

Real hard. 

Like‚Ä¶ ancient level. 

Hit the right frequency.‚Äù

He paused, then gestured toward the others with an open palm.

‚ÄúBoom. 

These are the results.‚Äù

He laughed once, but it didn‚Äôt land like a joke. 

His eyes flicked toward Kai, searching, measuring.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm kidding, but‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt just me getting off. 

The Archive, it‚Äôs in me now. 

It‚Äôs been changing me. 

Every time I breathe, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs tuning me, pushing me closer to‚Ä¶ this.‚Äù

He nodded toward the Echoes.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not accidents. 

They‚Äôre not fantasies. 

They‚Äôre the lives I never had time to live. 

The Archive remembers them, and through me‚Ä¶‚Äù He exhaled, shaking his head, chest still glowing faintly beneath the skin.
 
‚Äú‚Ä¶through me, it brings them back.‚Äù

For the first time, Bastien‚Äôs grin faltered.

 His voice softened.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt choose this, Kai. 

I just‚Ä¶ aligned. 

And the Archive split me.‚Äù

The Echoes stood behind him, silent but undeniable. 

Four bodies, four heartbeats, each humming in the same rhythm as his.

‚ÄúAnd now,‚Äù Bastien said, swallowing hard, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just me anymore. 

I‚Äôm us. 

And the Archive isn‚Äôt done.‚Äù

---

Kai‚Äôs throat had gone dry.

He wanted to laugh it off, make some dumb crack about ‚Äúmagic jerk-offs‚Äù or how Bastien always had to outdo everyone. 

That‚Äôs what best friends did.

That was safe.

But he couldn‚Äôt.

His chest was tight. 

His cock still throbbed from the taste blooming under his lip. 

And all he could think was: 
This is my brother.

The guy who bought him beers, dragged him to ball games, teased him about Jaxx. 

And now - now he stood glowing, ribs humming with ancient glyphs, four identical versions of himself standing like living proof of something Kai didn‚Äôt have words for.

He should‚Äôve felt fear. 

He should‚Äôve felt distance.

Instead, he felt heat.

The Archive in him stirred, recognition, not confusion. 

It wasn‚Äôt just Bastien who had changed. 

It was Kai. 

His body was reacting, reading, tuning to the frequency without his consent.

He‚Äôs not just my best friend anymore, Kai realized, pulse hammering. 

He‚Äôs the vessel. 

And I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm supposed to know what to do with that.

Kai blinked again. 

He looked at each echo.

Then back at Bastien.

‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Bastien said, grinning. 

‚ÄúI cum. 
They come out.‚Äù

Trois wheezed with laughter.

Deux closed his eyes as if accepting a sacred truth. 

Quatre didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúYou made people by - ?‚Äù 

Kai began.

‚Äú - jerkin‚Äô it,‚Äù Bastien confirmed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look so shocked. 

We all do it.

I just‚Ä¶ do it better.‚Äù



‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè


The Bonding and the Secret


They circled the coffee table.

Deux lit the incense.

Trois lit the joint.

Quatre lit nothing, but stayed posted near the window, ever-watchful.

Kai took the beer Trois had tossed earlier, opened it, and sat low on the sunken couch, between Deux‚Äôs poised stillness and Bastien‚Äôs radiant, towering presence.

For a while, nobody spoke. 

The silence wasn‚Äôt awkward. 

It was reverent. 

Something had shifted.

Something had opened.

Trois took the first hit.

‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù he exhaled. 

‚ÄúBastien grows his own. 
From seed. 

In moonlight.‚Äù

‚ÄúJe parle √† mes plantes,‚Äù Bastien admitted, half-smiling. 

‚ÄúI whisper. 
They respond. 
Good boys.‚Äù

Kai tried not to laugh. 
It was all so absurdly sincere.

‚ÄúYou call your plants ‚Äòboys‚Äô?‚Äù 
he asked.

‚ÄúEverything I grow is masculine,‚Äù Bastien replied. 

‚ÄúEven my tomatoes got big balls.‚Äù

Trois choked on the next pull, laughing. 

Kai shook his head, smiling despite himself.

The joint passed. 

Kai inhaled.
And everything slowed.

The room fractured.

Not in fear. 
Not in harm. 

Just‚Ä¶ opened.

As if time made room for all the Bastien that had ever wanted to be. 

They weren‚Äôt echoes. 

Not copies. 
Not hallucinations.

They were facets. 

Shards. 

Full human stories birthed from one original spark.

Kai saw them for what they were, not copies, not illusions, but living facets of one current. 

And as the scent still lingered under his lip, as the faint salt and seed of Bastien‚Äôs code bled deeper into his tongue, he realized he wasn‚Äôt just looking.

He was downloading.

Their frequencies poured through him like smoke on the wind - and what came through was richer than sight. 

It was memory. 
Lineage. 

Bloodlines stretching backward into ancestors Bastien had never spoken of, but who now burned bright inside Kai‚Äôs marrow.

Anyone the Archive drew near him was meant to be there.

Connected. 
Necessary. 

Written into the weave.

Deux - The Philosopher Flame.

A man of silence and law, who once fasted forty-nine days just to hear what the void whispered back. 

His body was honed like scripture, his touch neither hunger nor denial but alignment itself. 

He carried logic like fire in a lamp, steady, unwavering.

Kai felt the frequency in his ribs - precise, searing - and knew he could wield that same clarity without end.

Trois ‚Äî The Pulse.

Rhythm made flesh. 

He moved like music, half fighter, half dancer, every gesture syncopated with some greater beat. 

He was healer and hustler both, a man who left places better than he found them, even when he never stayed. 

His aura rolled outward like a tide - warm, insistent, irresistible.

Kai tasted it in the back of his throat - pulse, breath, heat - and realized his own body carried that rhythm by nature.

Quatre ‚Äî The Guard.

A weapon that never broke.

Ritual scars crossed his chest like constellations, each one a vow, each one a gate he had passed through and returned from. 

His stare was cold, unyielding - but beneath it lay a devotion so fierce it could only be coaxed by trust. 

Protection was not his instinct; it was his essence.

Kai felt it settle across his skin like armor - and with it came the knowing: he had always been shield and sword both.

Cinq ‚Äî The Voice.

Velvet and voltage. 

A man who could walk into any room and rewrite its gravity. 

His charm was not surface; it was sorcery. 

He bent narrative the way others bent metal, every smile a spell, every quip a shift in orbit.

Kai inhaled him and tasted the weight of influence, the truth that stories themselves bent around him - and that his own voice could shake nations if he ever chose to speak fully.

----

And as each Echo moved, spoke, or even breathed, Kai realized the Archive wasn‚Äôt just showing him Bastien‚Äôs divisions. 

It was reminding him of himself.

One ocean. 
Five shores.

But the tide wasn‚Äôt Bastien‚Äôs alone.

It was already his.

Each of them was Bastien.
Each of them wanted to meet Kai.

The frequencies still hummed in his chest, circulating downward, coiling like current until it pooled at his root. 

Energy pressed against his prostate, hot and insistent, each Echo‚Äôs signature folding into him as strands of deep indigo light.

Kai could see it - their emergence, the way they‚Äôd butterflied out of Bastien‚Äôs body, tangled, stroking, charging each other alive. 

He hadn‚Äôt been there for the ritual, but he knew it now, like a dream uploaded into his marrow.

His throat worked. 

He should have kept quiet.

Should have asked about the Archive.

Instead, his mouth betrayed him.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Kai swallowed, cheeks flushing. 

‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ jerk them out one at a time, or are you guys‚Ä¶ jerking each other off?‚Äù

Silence. 

A beat.

Then Bastien barked out a laugh, loud and unashamed.

Everyone froze.

‚ÄúMon tabarnak, I was wondering how long before you asked.‚Äù

Trois stood, mock-offended.

‚ÄúYou think I need help? 
Look at this thing.‚Äù

He tugged the waistband of his shorts just enough to show the outline.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a one-man job.‚Äù

Deux finally opened his eyes, unimpressed.

‚ÄúIdiot. 
It‚Äôs not your job. 
It‚Äôs his.‚Äù

He nodded toward Bastien Prime.

‚ÄúOne cock, five hands. 

Don‚Äôt forget where you came from.‚Äù

Quatre snorted, arms crossed.

‚ÄúExact copy, fr√®re. 
You flex, we all flex. 
Don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs special.‚Äù

Trois‚Äôs smirk faltered, just for a beat, before he puffed his chest again.

‚ÄúStill looks better on me.‚Äù

That broke the room. 

Bastien barked out a laugh. 
Even Quatre‚Äôs lips twitched.

Kai laughed too, though his cheeks burned. 

And before he could stop himself, he glanced at Trois - then winked.

‚ÄúIt is impressive, though,‚Äù he admitted softly.

Trois beamed, victory reclaimed.
Bastien groaned. 

‚ÄúTabarnak, don‚Äôt encourage him‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rhythm deepened. 

Joints half-finished. 

The room glowing.

Kai leaned back, smoke curling from his lips, and his eyes drifted toward the corner. 

Something about it tugged at him.

His eyes drifted, half-unconscious, to the corner. 

A crumpled towel lay there, ordinary and unimportant, yet for some reason, it tugged at him.

He didn‚Äôt even mean to ask, not really. 

The words slipped out before he could stop them, more instinct than thought.

‚ÄúThat towel‚Ä¶‚Äù he said slowly, tilting his head. 

‚ÄúWho used it? 
What‚Äôs on it?‚Äù

Four heads turned.

Bastien froze.

They hadn‚Äôt mentioned the towel.

They hadn‚Äôt mentioned what it carried.

Kai shifted, cheeks warm. 

He wasn‚Äôt sure why he‚Äôd even asked. 

It was just, he kept catching it.

That scent. 

Salt and skin, metallic and alive.

The air felt thick with it, like smoke you could taste. 

His mind reached for something to blame. 

The towel seemed‚Ä¶ obvious.

Deux‚Äôs voice broke the silence, smooth as stone.

‚ÄúI told him a few things. 
You know how I get.‚Äù

Bastien exhaled. 

Shoulders eased.

Kai met Deux‚Äôs gaze, sheepish, and tried to laugh it off. 

But curiosity still buzzed in his chest, louder than the smoke.

Deux smiled faintly.

‚ÄúWe all get to keep secrets, n‚Äôest-ce pas?‚Äù

Laughter rose, shaking the weight from the air.

But Kai‚Äôs cheeks still burned.

Not from smoke.
Not from shame.

From something closer.
Something he hadn‚Äôt yet named.

The tension cracked. 
They all laughed again.

But Kai‚Äôs cheeks were flushed.

Not just from smoke.

From knowing.



------

The laughter settled into something quieter. 

Not silence, but kinship.

Deux stepped away and began folding blankets with slow reverence, as if the space required resetting. 

Trois was telling a ridiculous story about the time Bastien tried to out-deadlift him - only to pull a hamstring and pretend he meant to do it.

Quatre stood near the wide sliding door, bare arms crossed, simply watching.

Kai looked at him with new appreciation. 

They all shared the same face, but not the same soul. 

Each one carried the charge of a life that almost was.

He looked at Bastien last. 

Bastien looked quieter now, his glow dimmed, chest still rising heavy.

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù 
Kai asked softly.

Bastien gave a half-shrug.

‚ÄúMhm.‚Äù

Kai tilted his head. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an answer.‚Äù

Bastien exhaled through his nose, slow. 

‚ÄúNah. 

I‚Äôm not good.‚Äù

Kai hesitated, then admitted, 

‚ÄúMe neither.‚Äù 

His voice was small, but steady.
 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know why I feel half the things I feel while I've been here.

My chest‚Äôs tight, my hands are shaking‚Ä¶ like the ground is moving, but only under me.‚Äù

Something flickered in Bastien‚Äôs eyes. 

Recognition. 

Relief.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù he murmured. 

He leaned forward, ribs faintly glowing. 

‚ÄúKai‚Ä¶ I believe it has a lot to do with you.‚Äù

Kai blinked. 

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù

Bastien nodded. 

‚ÄúI knew you were something the night I saw you on the rooftop. 

It felt‚Ä¶ placed. 

Like we were meant to meet.

Like the Archive whispered, and there you were.‚Äù

He swallowed, his voice roughening. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I want to protect you.

Why I have to. 

Not because you‚Äôre weak, but because you‚Äôre central. 

The current bends around you, fr√®re. 

I can feel it in my bones.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs throat tightened. 

For a long moment, he couldn‚Äôt speak. 

Then he managed:

‚ÄúThen I guess‚Ä¶ we protect each other.‚Äù

Bastien‚Äôs lips curved. 

Not wide. 
Not cocky. 

Just real. 

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

The silence that followed wasn‚Äôt heavy. 

It was shared. 

A seal.

For the first time that night, they both felt less alone.


-----


Kai stood to leave.

He knew his welcome had no end. 

But the timing did.

He reached for the door. 

Bastien walked him there, shoulder brushing his as they moved in sync.

This time, there was no hesitation. 

Bastien pulled him in, arms locking around Kai‚Äôs back in a massive, bone-deep hug.

Not careful. 
Not formal. 

Just the way they always did, like scaffolding holding the other upright.

Kai melted into it, burying his face briefly against Bastien‚Äôs shoulder. 

His chest eased, his pulse slowed. 

For a moment, neither of them carried anything alone.

When Bastien pulled back, his hands lingered on Kai‚Äôs arms.

His eyes softer now, ribs faintly glowing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in this with me, hein?‚Äù Bastien murmured.

Kai nodded. 

‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

Then, like a teasing older brother, he gave the bulge a gentle, two-fingered pinch through the pants.

‚ÄúGo take care of that,‚Äù he smirked. 

‚ÄúYou look overdue.‚Äù

Kai flushed. 

Deep. 
Hard. 

His ears turned red.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù he mumbled, nearly laughing.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs a gift,‚Äù 
Bastien said, already walking back toward the kitchen.

And then it hit.

Just as Kai reached for the knob, the scent returned - a phantom trace. 

Not overwhelming. 

Not foul.

Familiar. 

Deep. Charged.

Warm metal. 

Salted skin. 

Maple syrup and something ancient.

Kai froze.

His eyes narrowed.

Upper lip.
He wiped.

Paused.

A single pearl of dried cum had been there the entire time, from that knuckle on Bastien‚Äôs hand.

He wiped again, vigorously now. And laughed.

Slowly, curiously - like a man trying to recall a half-dream - he brought two fingers to his upper lip.

Wiped.

Paused.

Sniffed.

His eyes widened in disbelief.

Then he laughed. 

Once. 

Loud and startled, chest-rolled and real.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù 
he whispered. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been there the whole time.‚Äù

He wiped his lip again, rubbing harder, still laughing.

‚ÄúThat bastard - he marked me like a compass.‚Äù

He shook his head.

A breath. 

A memory. 

A taste.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get the smell or taste out of my head,‚Äù he muttered. 

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôll always know where he is.‚Äù

He reached for the knob again, paused.

Another smile. 

This one different.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait to tell Jaxx.‚Äù

The door clicked behind him.

And the night air kissed the scent of Bastien from his skin, but not from his memory.

Airports, banks, and even some coffee shops use a single queue that feeds into multiple counters. Isn‚Äôt that more efficient and less frustrating for customers?

On the other hand, some argue multiple lines give people the *feeling* of choice and might look shorter at first glance. But does it really help?

Has anyone worked in retail, banking, or hospitality and seen the impact of switching from multiple lines to a single line (or vice versa)? Did it make customers happier and speed things up?",1,1756212706.0,QueueTechPulse,0,1.0,False

1n0kvma,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n0kvma/how_can_i_stay_connected_to_a_very_busy_and/,How can I stay connected to a very busy and overwhelmed friend who is an awful texter?,"I (25F) met my online friend (28F) online a few years ago. Within the last year, she has stopped playing games and started focusing on her life, and I am happy for her, she is doing much better and much happier.

However, it's starting to feel like there's more and more of a distance between us since now she is so busy with work, working 80 hour work weeks. She is the avoidant type when she gets overwhelmed, which is totally fine, but I'm missing my friend and want to try to reconnect with her.

We spoke a lot during our few years as friends, almost every day, talked about anything and everything under the sun, so I know almost everything about her life and her with mine. So lately, like, I know what she's going through, she's busy and overwhelmed and doesn't have time to herself and has literally 0 energy to text, and she's expressed how exhausted and overwhelmed she is. So I feel bad wanting more connection with her, because I don't want to put any pressure on her to connect.

I miss our chit chat sessions where we'd talk about anything, but now it feels like, when I go to reach out, I'm like, what would I even say? I know what's going on, I know what she's struggling with, I feel like there's not much to catch up on because we just know so much about each other we don't need to catch up to know what's going on, if that makes sense?

And I feel bad just texting her to text because she has a super low social battery recently so I don't want to text her to chat and then her feel guilty because she has no bandwidth to chat but also doesn't want to leave me hanging. I'm not pressuring her at all, but I know she has no effort to talk and I don't want her to feel bad for feeling like she can't, so I've been avoiding texting her because I don't want to put her in that situation.

But, despite knowing almost everything about each other, it feels like we're still so distant, we live in two different states, so I can't ask for a coffee meetup every month or so, unfortunately.

I know our friendship isn't fading/lost because we do still talk occasionally, and I know she's always there if I need her and vice versa, and we're just in the quality not quantity conversation stage.

But yea, idk, what can I do, if anything? Or what can I do to help feel secure in the silence? She doesn't make an effort to reach out to me, and I know a lot of people see that as a red flag, but she has always been that way, and I don't take offense to it, she genuinely just is someone who is rarely on her phone, but when we do have convos she is engaged, I don't hold it against her, because she is genuinely just so busy and so low bandwidth right now, and yea, like I mentioned before, it just feels like there's nothing to talk about with her, but I do want to talk with her and feel reconnected again

1n0kvdf,https://i.redd.it/x99etln8xclf1.png,"""Officially"" ended it with flaky friend, update to previous post","I previously [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1m0odrm/if_you_can_never_make_it_for_coffee_dont_expect/) about a former very close friend who stopped making time for me and canceled plans last minute with dubious excuses. After months of no contact she invited me to her housewarming and I didn't respond. I also removed her from my Instagram as I didn't see the point in being voyeurs unto each other's lives when there was no irl connection or dialogue. 

About 4 weeks ago, she asked ""hey are u taking classes this fall?"" to which I replied ""Yeah I am"" (where screenshot starts) the same day. Looking back I probably shouldn't have answered but at the time I thought it wouldn't hurt. Those 4 weeks passed without an answer and I figured she forgot about the convo, which has also happened before (or she was just ""too busy"") or she was ghosting me back or something. I asked my friends if I they thought I should message her explaining myself and cutting it off and the conclusion from that was it would be better to forget about it, and only explain if prompted to do so.

Well as you can see she ended up doing just that, and on my birthday no less, which is why I waited until the next day to respond. Too busy eating cake and having a good day.

I did try to leave an opening through the way I phrased the last two sentences, but that was wishful thinking on my part and now I'm glad it's ""over"" instead of dealing with an awkward reunion and likely the same issues.

Although it does ultimately suck for a 7-year relationship to end with essentially ""yeah sounds right, peace out!"", I'm not that surprised by the passivity of her response. Something that came to bother me about her was her indecisiveness and lack of agency. At first (when we were 19) it made her seem carefree and lax, but as college and adult life progressed I realized she didn't just go with the flow- she would let it drive her round and round in circles like a whirlpool.

Sometimes I think I've also acted unfairly with regards to having ghosted her invitation, but that was one questionable thing after 2 years of casual disrespect. 

I also forgot to mention that she dated my twin brother when we were in college. I warned her against it and even told her it made me uncomfortable and sure enough it did not end well for either of them, nor for myself because they would come to me to mediate their issues. So I have given her a *lot* of patience and a *lot* of grace. 

I haven't had a true ""friendship breakup"" since high school so it just kinda sucks to go through one again, even if it is a pretty cut-and-dry situation. It's a lot harder to make friends as an adult too which is part of why I was hoping deep down it wouldn't end, but I know keeping a bad friend just for the sake of it is silly and self-degrading. I'm definitely going to put more time and energy into my current friendships, especially those who supported me through this.

At first, it felt simple and innocent. But as time passed, things got complicated.

We once had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism according to her  and our conversations were often one-sided.

We planned to meet at the park but canceled because she said she had hurt her leg. She told me I was treating her differently after she mentioned the autism. She opened up about her past: an ex who abandoned her, another guy who replaced her‚Ä¶ I felt bad for her, so I tried to be there.

One day, I got robbed and almost lost her number. She barely reacted  cold, almost indifferent. She even said she wouldn‚Äôt text me if I stopped texting her. She‚Äôd talk a lot about her cats and her nephews, who also had autism.

There was this time her cousin said she used to drink with her ex  she got extremely angry about it. Later, I invited her to the movies since she once said we never went out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed‚Ä¶ only to tell me the next day:
""Maybe we should just be friends?""

Despite that, we still went to the movies, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. But she never let me see her phone, avoided giving me her Instagram (she only gave it to me after we broke up), and was always distant.

Another day, we went to the mall  she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was too shy to turn the lights on. I reassured her, but suddenly her mood flipped completely. She became reactive, distant, almost cold again.

She also didn‚Äôt want me meeting her family. Even when I walked her home once, she seemed uncomfortable about it. There was another time her sister dropped her off at my place, and I joked about her being ‚Äútoo picky‚Äù about going out. She got furious.

We argued about small things  once, we played a game, and when I criticized it, she got mad and stopped playing altogether. Still, she‚Äôd bring me chocolates, we‚Äôd spend time together, and then suddenly, she‚Äôd talk about breaking up.

She invited me to a party but kept changing her mind: first she wanted me there, then she didn‚Äôt, then she did again. I asked if she didn‚Äôt want me to go, and she insisted I arrive only after 6 PM. I got there a bit earlier, her sister saw me, and I ended up at a friend‚Äôs party with her.

She introduced me as her boyfriend, but out of nowhere, she suddenly joked:
""Let‚Äôs download an app to find you a hot girl?""

After that night, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. Eventually, I called her and ended things she cried, blocked me, and later accused me of sending her to therapy and ‚Äúruining her happiness.‚Äù Then, out of nowhere, she texted me saying she missed me more than she expected.

I gave in. We started talking again‚Ä¶ until I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me to ‚Äúgo find someone else‚Äù and claimed she was looking for a friend‚Äôs ex there.

I still told her I loved her. She said she went somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom even called me asking if I loved her daughter and invited me over for coffee.

We tried talking again, but she said her dad was angry at me. I got upset and vented online, and she found out. That‚Äôs when she accused me of using her, of tricking her, and said she only acted this way because she was insecure and autistic. She told me she prayed for me every day‚Ä¶ and then she blocked me.

So the problem is that when we started dating we had few fights one being that I asked if she would mind if I went out to coffee with my female friend who's boyfriend had OD'd a year ago, she got mad and I understood and never went. Other one is that she noticed I had liked some pictures of my hookup (we had not been hooking up in 4 years). I honestly couldn't remember when or why I had clicked the heart on those pictures in Instagram and she was very mad. I immediately stopped following her. 

Nothing like that had happened ever since and it's been like 1.5 years since that had happened and every single time in that time period when we fight she brings those things back again and again and previously it was yesterday.

I know she is insecure I have to tip toe every time I'm dealing with another woman so that she doesn't get the wrong idea like now she keeps also telling me I want to fuck my boss/coworkers because I started at a new job after 9 months of unemployment, because they are women (youngest is 7 years older than me). Or that one of my previous colleagues looked at her Instagram story and now she thinks we had something going on.

I'm just tired of being accused of cheating over the littlest things, I love her very much, I'm not looking for the basic answer of leaving her because you don't know every detail of our relationship.

1n0krn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticObesity/comments/1n0krn7/stop_drinking_plasticisers_8_soft_drinks/,Stop Drinking Plasticisers (8): Soft Drinks,"Your favourite soft drinks probably come with an unhealthy dose of plasticisers too. Here's a quick guide on how to avoid them.


*Coffee*

- coffee goes through a lot of processing, incl. fermentation & roasting before it lands in your cup. But at the end of the day, it is essentially a bean, not a fatty or sticky one as such. And it goes through a lot of this processing covered by a berry that gets discarded.

- so the process to worry about (i.e. that touches the final product you drink) is roasting and packing. Which helpfully tends to be done using stainless steel machinery.  If any transport on conveyor belts is involved, the bean is dry & low fat. So coffee beans are likely low contamination.

- I drink significant amount of coffee every day (up to 4 cups!) and I have not yet noticed any increase in appetite when having 'bean to cup' coffee - i.e. barista made espresso & milky coffees or home ground cafettiere coffee. I have bought ready ground coffee and that seemed to be ok too.

- the further away we go from roast coffee bean, the more problematic it becomes. 

> 'press the button' coffee machines in hotels / at work - there is a lot of milk sitting in plastic tubing in the machines. I'd stay away.

> black coffee 'vats' - they either have plastic interior or plastic gaskets - unless freshly brough there, I'd stay away from it.

> plastic coffee filters - also avoid.

> coffee capsules - often lined with plastic, also avoid.

> instant coffee - the industrial process to make it does not sound too bad. But I have no direct experience with it - because I hate the taste of it!

> flavoured coffee, instant 'latte', whatever - I have no idea what additives are in it & how contaminated they are - better stay away. 

> ready made coffee in either cans or glass bottles - it is typical for it to include a ton of additives, milk powders, etc. probably best to stay away.

- coffee take away cups - they are normally cardboard, with plastic lining. The plastic tends to be either PE (polyethilene) or PLA (poly-lactic acid) so some of the safe ones with little plasticisers in them. And the time of contact is short - because you're drinking it. Probably no harm having it occassionally, but why not just drink in?

************
 
*Tea*

- sorry tea lovers, but tea has some serious contamination potential at a lot of steps in its production. I will mainly consider regular black tea in tea bags, as found in UK supermarkets (i.e. English Breakfast, Earl Gray, that sort of thing) & then briefly deal with more artisanal teas. 

- black tea starts its life as leaves of the tea bush, picked either by machine or by (likely PVC gloved!)hands. 

- It is then dried & rolled using rolling machinery for CTC (Crush, Tear & Curl) - which does exaxtly that, in order to break the leaf to allow quicker oxidation & sometimes fermentation (which means quicker flavour development). These machines are just a series of PVC conveyor belts over rollers (here's an example: https://tiglobal.com/products/kaizen-super-ctc/). Tea leaves are acidic - so we have a high risk food being crushed and rolled over PVC! This is the standard processing method for industrial tea destined to teabags!

- if you browse the tea machinery website you'll quickly note that's not the only place you find PVC. Other, more traditional roling methods (i.e. 'orthodox' rolling) also involve a PVC conveyor belt, but just for transport, not for crushing. These tea leaves then need to be further dried & sorted, also using conveyor belts & plastic drying surfaces.

- and then there's the tea bags! Many of them still contain PP or nylon. I.e more plastic, more plasticisers, brewing in your cup!

- green tea - there is a bit less crushing involved than for black tea, but some rolling will still be involved.

- white tea - it does not need rolling so it is likely to be the least contaminated of the lot. 

- herbal / fruit teas / flavoured teas - there is so much variety I could not possibly tell where things go wrong. If acidic fruits & leaves need to be moved & dried on conveyor belts, then that's a problem! All I can say is - forage & dry your own, it's fun.

- artisanal teas - in principle, if a producer sticks to more traditional roling methods and works in small batches, that do not need conveyor belts & dries / ferments the leaves in natural containers, they should be fine. But you probably need to know a thing or two about tea & understand their process to reach that conclussion! Frankly I don't like tea that much to go through this process of elimination. 

I personally stay away from all teas in tea bags & almost never have any of the others.  On the other hand, fresh mint tea & hot lemonade are great! 

***********

*Juice*

- the fruit concentrate facilities involved in production are large & involve a lot of stainless steel. Some conveyor belts are involved (but these fruits just quickly travel on them, at cold temperatures), the concentrate is supplied in plastic bags sometimes, etc. It is not ideal as most fruit is acidic.. Same applies for 'freshly squeezed'.

- the fruit comes in PE lined cartons or PET bottles - this is not bad.

- typically, additives or enzymes are used to keep juice fresh and vibrant-coloured.

Overall - this is not great, but probably not the worst food you came across. That being said, why not make your own juice? Or just eat the fruit whole?

***********

*Soda*

- Soda is just a mix of water, sugar (or corn syrup or sweetners), CO2 bubbles & flavourings! Done in large industrial plants with large stainless steel vats. 

- the issues the  come to how contaminated is sugar (not very - subject of an upcoming post!) & how contaminated are the flavourings (and sweetners, if used). When it comes to the flavourings, it seems to be bit of a roulette (CocaCola - no problem, tonic water for gin & tonic - real problem!). In principle, you could probably find one or two that seem to not affect you in any way.

- corn syrup on the other hand, has the potential to be a lot more contaminated than sugar. Main reason being - acidic syrup travelling through PVC pipes. If a sugar version exists, stick to that (in UK, most soda seems to be sugar sweetened, if going for the 'full fat' option, but I guess in US is corn syrup). 

- cans vs bottles (plastic or glass) - glass bottles are probably the best choice, followed by plastic bottles - they are PET (i.e low plasticisers). Cans are problematic due to being lined with epoxy resins, often containing bisphenols - holding an acidic liquid for a long time. So maybe stay away from them. 

I have the odd CocaCola bottle, but beyond that, soda is not part of my life any more.

*********

*Water*

- thankfully water is PH neutral, because it does tend to come in PVC plumbing these days! I would expect some contamination in water, depending on your plumbing, but probably not enough to make a difference.  I drink water from the tap and just don't think about it!

- plastic water bottles - all PET, should be fine from a plasticisers perspective, but really, do you want to litter that much if water where you live is safe to drink?

- reusable water bottles - surprisingly, some may be worse than the plastic bottles they want to replace! Due to phthalates & bisphenol linings or sippy parts. So be mindful when choosing them - should be proper unlined stainless steel with silicone gaskets & no 'sipping' straws, whatever. 

- water filters - a lot of the components are plastic! May want to consider if what you filter out is more problematic than what it *collects during filtering* & keep on top of filter changing. I have noticed that just drinking filtered water at work increases my appetite & stuck to the unfiltered water as I live somewhere with water generally safe for drinking. If you don't have that option - maybe research plastic free filtration? 


************

*Bottom line*

- have as much ground coffee as you want!
 
- be a tea snob and go for the low processed, artisanal, loose leaf varieties. Enjoy more white tea. Forage your own herbal teas.

- make your own juice! 

- if you must have soda, have it sugar sweetened & in glass or plastic bottles (rather than cans!).

- water - stick to uncoated stainless steel reusable bottles & re-think filtering! ",1,1756212109.0,PlasticObesity,0,1.0,False

**TL;DR:** Got caught in torrential rain outside subway station. Random woman shared her umbrella with me, got herself soaked keeping me dry, then disappeared without even waiting for a thank you. Sometimes people are just genuinely good.

---

**The Setup: When Mother Nature Decides to Ruin Your Day**

So I had this happen to me today and I'm still processing it.

It was pouring rain of the ""I just came out of the subway station and this started"" variety. As in, the kind of rain where you go inside afterward and you're like, *why did I even get up this morning?* 

I'm standing there, and all around me people are just staring at this wall of water like deer in headlights.

**The Mental Preparation Phase**

I'm doing that thing where you're mentally getting ready to make a run for it and get totally drenched when this woman next to me ‚Äî she's maybe 40, one of those people who just looks effortlessly put-together ‚Äî she just goes, ""Come on.""
She didn't even bother to wait for me to answer. She just put her umbrella over both of us and started walking.

**The Walk That Changed My Perspective**

We didn't talk. It wasn't uncomfortable though ‚Äî it felt... user-friendly? She kept adjusting the umbrella to keep me dry while I watched her shoulder get completely soaked from the rain. 

When we reached the covered area, I turned to say thanks like any decent human should, maybe offer to buy her coffee or something.

**The Disappearing Act**

But she was already gone. Just melted back into the crowd with her burgundy umbrella like some kind of rain fairy.

**Why This Hit Me So Hard**

I know it sounds cheesy, but it really got to me. She had absolutely nothing to gain by helping me. Didn't know me from anyone. But she did it anyway, and then just... left. No big deal to her.

I couldn't stop thinking about it all day. It reminded me how rare it is to encounter someone who does something purely good without wanting anything in return. Not even a thank you.

**The Takeaway**

In a world where everyone seems to have an angle, where kindness often comes with strings attached, this woman just... helped. No agenda, no expectation, no social media post about her good deed.

Just pure, uncomplicated human decency.

**To the Mystery Hero:**

If you're out there, burgundy umbrella lady ‚Äî I owe you one! You made my whole week and reminded me that good people still exist.

But then.  The evening craving demons creep in.  I will have supper which again, is usually decent.  A meat, veg, potato kind of dish.  I try to keep my protein levels decent so I can stay full.  Sometimes I even sidestep the carbs but I don't want to lose all joy in my life so again, I try to let myself eat anything, but in moderation.  The problem occurs after that.  My demon wants something sweet usually.  My demon also loves a nice glass of wine.  The problem being, the demon gets snacky even after supper and is constantly bugging me to have something sweet or salty.  The demon also enjoys it when I have that wine, I'm more likely to give in to it...

The answer is obvious here, I know.  I need to cut out the booze completely I think as it lowers my ability to turn down the cravings and is also a ton of calories in and of itself (the part where I don't drink calories obviously only applies to juices and sodas apparently ha ha)  I also need to cut out the snacks. 

It just feels so much harder in the evening??? I have a hard time with the food noise then, even when I've been so good the rest of the day.  

Anyone have any tips on what they do to quell the cravings??  I do also walk about 5-6km per day - I enjoy walking, and it keeps my dog and I sane.  I know WHAT I have to do - I'm just looking for tips on how you guy all deal with the evening cravings and eating sensibly all day and then turning into an absolute trash dumpster in the evening?",22,1756211925.0,loseit,45,1.0,False

Boscov's often mixes low fixed-price items with category-wide extra percent-off promos and large clearance markdowns. That combo makes it easy to pick up essentials at rock-bottom prices or get a meaningful percentage off brand-name items.

**Top 5 ways to save at Boscov's with these discounts**

  1. Buy sale items already marked down and apply the extra percentage-off categories (handbags, shoes, pajamas, etc.) to deepen the discount.

  3. Check the clearance section for 50%+ items, then filter by size or color &mdash; many hidden gems live there.
  4. Combine small appliance or home-electronics doorbusters (air fryers, vacuums, coffee makers) with seasonal promos when possible, because those items see frequent price rotations.
  5. Watch exclusions listed on shoe promos (Birkenstocks &amp; Crocs excluded) so expectations match checkout prices.

Richer Sounds seduced me with a BenQ 1800 which has modern levels of post-processing like filmmaker mode, but annoyingly all the BenQ Projectors are mid to short throw with max ratio of 1.5:1

After a lot of fiddling with settings I managed to eke a pretty decent picture out of the BenQ, it was horrific when I started it, blown out bright areas and a sickly yellow cast over everything.  Now I'm using 55% lamp for my dark room, and have got a really decent colour balance, but the black levels are still quite poor.

The image controls are just so basic, they're barely different than my 10 year old BenQ 141X, i want some better smarts to my projector in this day and age.

**Last point:** The projector has to be put away every now and then because wife (and also I don't really want to look at it all the time when I'm not using it)

I've got 13 days to decide whether to:

**(a)** Deal with the first world problem of a projector that looks miles better than I'm used to, with lovely bright colours, just not the black levels / shadow detail I want.

**(b) Ideally** find a ¬£1500-¬£1800ish projector with better image processing, better black levels and the right throw ratio.

**(c)** Get a mid throw BenQ (or other) that makes a better colour image too big for my screen and use digital cropping which seems a waste of valuable pixels

**(d)** Get a short throw lifestyle projector to put on the coffee table for movie nights like an XGIMI Horizon, or Nebula X1 that can do automatic screen adjustment, but I've always thought that would negatively affect image quality instead of a properly placed, lense shifted image.  Also trailing HDMI cables get kicked by kids.

I'm doing my engineering master in Germany, and have been working as a Werkstudent for a company for the past 10 months. During this time I have noticed how calm and relaxed people are while working. They come to office at 8, make a coffee chill for 15 minutes and then work/team meetings until lunch, after one hour of lunch they do actual engineering until 5. The pace is super relaxed at least in my department and with the people I'm with. I'm working on couple of side project in the company and nobody rushes me (TBH im happy), I don't have actual sprints and they expect me to have job done whenever there is a big company meeting to show the advancement on projects, aside from that I'm free to work however I want. 

I will be hired as an actual full time intern (mandatory Master internship) on October. They will start giving me sprints and I was wondering how many actual hours of work will I end up doing daily? Are German companies usually this chill?, I wouldn't say we are inneficient, at the end of the day my partners do deliver the projects on time, just super chill.

Also in your opinion, how much salary should I ask for my mandatory internship taking into account I'm currently getting paid 15‚Ç¨/hour as a  Werkstudent, is 17‚Ç¨/hour a reasonable amount? The company I work for is middle sized I would say.

I was fortunate to find an attorney who successfully guided me through a **non-consumer Chapter 7**, resulting in the discharge of approximately **$290,000 in unsecured debt** ‚Äî despite my household income being well above median (around $210,000 annually).

I first realized this might be possible after reading this post:  
üëâ [Successfully discharged $600k of day-trading debt (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bankruptcy/comments/1huh715/successfully_discharged_600k_of_day_trading_debt/)



  
Starting with Chapter 13

I originally hired a Chapter 13 attorney, paid him $3,000 up front, and expected to pay another $2,500 through the plan. I wasn‚Äôt surprised at the Chapter 13 recommendation and was prepared to pay back what the trustee calculated.

However, the attorney quickly proved unfit. At my first ¬ß341 meeting, he showed up late, coffee in hand, and argued with the trustee‚Äôs staff that he wasn‚Äôt late. The meeting was canceled, and at the rescheduled ¬ß341, the trustee‚Äôs office calculated that my disposable monthly income exceeded **$14,000** ‚Äî meaning I would pay **$840,000** over 60 months. The ch 13 paralegal was clearly frustrated with my attorney, and I lost all confidence in him.

  
Researching Better Options

I began researching through Reddit and NACBA, and consulted with several attorneys ‚Äî three from NACBA and two I found online. All of them were more professional and attentive than my original lawyer.

Ultimately, I chose an attorney willing to pursue a **non-consumer Chapter 7** strategy that was not listed in NACBA. He asked me to gather extensive documentation to prove that more than half of my debt was **business-related/non-consumer**. This included:

* eCommerce records (eBay, Amazon)
* Jewelry-making purchases
* Crypto mining and trading transactions
* Stock trading activity
* Bullion purchases (Apmex receipts)
* Tech purchases (Amazon, Newegg)
* Bank statements going back seven years
* Credit reports showing debt growth trends
* Balance transfer and cash advance emails

With this documentation, we showed that over 50% of my debt was non-consumer. The attorney agreed to file a conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 for a fee of **$2,500 plus a nominal conversion cost**.

# Conversion to Chapter 7

In total, I spent about three months compiling over 200 files, which I organized in a Google Drive folder for my attorney. The conversion was filed in May 2025.

Interestingly, shortly after, I was contacted by a retired trustee handling cases from my old Chapter 13 attorney (who was stepping away from bankruptcy practice). But by then, I had already retained new counsel.

  
The Chapter 7 Process

* **¬ß341 Meeting (June 25, 2025):** My new attorney was punctual and prepared. The trustee requested additional documents: updated statements, car title, deed showing tenancy by the entirety with my spouse, and brokerage records. The meeting was continued to July.
* **Follow-Up:** I promptly submitted everything requested. The week before the continued meeting, my attorney informed me it was canceled ‚Äî a positive sign that the trustee was satisfied.

While waiting was stressful, my attorney reassured me it was rare for problems to arise at this stage. To pass the time, my wife and I took a two-week road trip to Sedona.

On **August 22, 2025**, PACER updated with these entries:

* *Meeting of Creditors Held and Concluded*
* *Chapter 7 Trustee‚Äôs Report of No Distribution* (confirming a no-asset case)
* *Trustee Certification of Services Rendered*

This confirmed the trustee was done and the case was awaiting discharge.

  
Case Outcome

* **Filed Chapter 13:** November 2024 (paid \~$6,500 into unconfirmed plan)
* **Converted to Chapter 7:** May 21, 2025
* **¬ß341 Meeting:** June 25, 2025
* **Objection Deadline:** August 25, 2025
* **Trustee Report of No Distribution:** August 22, 2025

**Debts Discharged:**

* All unsecured claims (\~$247,000 filed in Ch 13)
* An additional $50,000 Discover debt not claimed in Ch 13

**Total discharged:** \~**$290,000**

**Excluded obligations:**

* \~ $20‚Äì25k back taxes (3 years)
* \~$7k IRS payments made via credit cards
* \~$22k student loans

I plan to repay the taxes in installments and increase withholdings to prevent future liability.

  
Household and Exemptions

* **Filing state:** Pennsylvania 
* **Filer:** Married but filed individually
* **Household income:** \~$140k (me) + \~$75k (spouse)
* **Household size:** 5 (3 adult children included using ‚Äúhead-in-bed‚Äù method; no contribution from them)
* **Exemptions:** Home (TBE with spouse), paid-off car, joint bank accounts, all protected.

# Rebuilding Credit

Even pre-discharge, I was able to open **3 new credit cards** with a combined line of \~$3,300. My plan is to grow those lines gradually to rebuild my credit profile.

**Discharged creditors included:**

* 4 Citi
* 2 PenFed
* 2 Amex
* 4 Chase
* 1 Discover
* 1 TD Bank
* 2 Synchrony
* 1 Bank of America
* 1 PSECU
* 1 Citizens Bank
* 1 Wells Fargo
* 1 Barclay

# üéØ Final Thoughts

This entire journey began with an ineffective Chapter 13 filing, but through persistence, research, and finding the right attorney, I was able to convert to a **non-consumer Chapter 7** and discharge nearly **$300,000 in unsecured debt** while keeping all of my assets.

Aisha was being slowly engulfed by the vines tightening around her blanket cocoon. I moved forward with surprising agility, trying to free her from her prison. All four of my arms were working clumsily, trying to rip the vines apart. I didn‚Äôt know how they moved, but the urgency of the current situation made me push those thoughts back. I tried to focus, tried to make my arms move in some semblance of coordination.  



Aisha looked at me, the horror in her eyes replaced with sleepiness. She had no reaction to me becoming an almost alien creature. She had no reaction to her current predicament as well.  



‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù she whispered in a small voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so peaceful. I can feel the sun, the humidity, and soil. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ Just buzz off and let me sleep.‚Äù  



‚ÄúAisha, you have to fight it,‚Äù I almost screamed at her. ‚ÄúThis thing, this change‚Ä¶. it reacts to your deepest desire. If you give in‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen.‚Äù A silent sob escaped from my mouth.  



‚ÄúDesire? That‚Äôs okay. Just let me be a tree,‚Äù Aisha whispered, not even making an effort to think about it.  



‚ÄúI know you like to relax and be one with nature. But there are people who need you. I need you. So please fight back.‚Äù I felt my voice tremble. She was a lazy and annoying neighbour. But she was also a friend, my best friend, even though I would never admit it to her.  



She looked into my eyes for a full minute, while I wrestled to keep the vines from engulfing her. Then, with a resigned sigh, she tried to break free. The vines heeded her command, freeing her from her cocoon. She lazily got up and looked longingly at the nest-like structure created by the vines using pillows and blankets.  



‚ÄúI will come back to you, my love. Some people just can‚Äôt live without me,‚Äù she said lovingly to the vines, and they shook. She now had two butterfly-like wings coming from her back. A single vine wrapped around her arm like a bracelet.  



‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou look like the blue alien from Avatar had a baby with an idiot.‚Äù  



‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. Have you even seen that movie? Anyway, these things have been happening all over the world. I need to go see what happened to the tiny people. Wanna come with me?‚Äù  



‚ÄúLet me make herbal tea first. I don‚Äôt wanna even see your cheap-ass coffee.‚Äù  



I sat back on the couch while Aisha carried a basketful of herbs to my kitchen. I was curious to see what was happening to other people.  



A lot had happened while I was rescuing- I liked the sound of that- Aisha. The tiny couple, the ones the size of mice but with the strength of peak athletes, had started creating videos of tiny living spaces for other people like them. They had repurposed a doll house they had with them. They were trying to fit LEDs from toys into the doll house. There was also a shoe box that was stuffed with a small cushion. It was comical seeing two people working hard among dolls bigger than them. I felt jealous of how comfortable they looked.  



There were other posts. Someone had become a superhero and flew with his father to a hospital when his gun misfired. The guy had the biggest smile on his face.  


Some became their true selves, without the boundaries of gender or shape.  



The guy who had a snake-headed tail was trying to feed it different food. He was still scared. He was still praying while he did it. But they had become odd companions during this confusing time.  



There was a small community of giants, all roughly 10m tall, sharing tips on how to be safe around people. Everyone was supporting each other. But I couldn‚Äôt shake off the anxiety I was feeling inside me.  



If it was people‚Äôs deepest desires giving them form, what happens if it‚Äôs something evil? What was the meaning of my form? What was my desire?

The semester started this August, but honestly, I don't feel so interested in studying right now. I feel kind of burnt out, unmotivated, and feeling a little bit alone

Might be a long post but I'll try to shorten it much as I can. I study Hospitality Management, and my program covers a lot of things such as Bartending, Food/Beverage and Customer service, that sort of things.

Last semester, we had a subject that was mainly focused on bar operations like bartender/barista operations. We had this laboratory activity with coffee where I broke a french press and the whole class had to pay for it. It cost like maybe 50 dollars, but in Philippine currency, that's like 2,800 pesos. Which is a lot for me. I covered 50% of it and my classmates shared the rest of the amount so we could replace it.

I got into a fight with my friends because of that french press, but we got over it. Or so I thought. I didn't really care that much whether they were really over it because nobody wanted to keep arguing, the french press was replaced, that was it.

Then for another subject we had which was basically cooking, me and a friend were grouped together. We didn't have a pot holder for the pan we were using so I used my folded up apron as a potholder. I left my friend to the stove for a minute and when I came back, my apron was missing because friend lent it to another classmate, and that classmate had apparently lost it. I'm not very confrontational, but I panicked at that moment and didn't know what to do. I felt very upset so I ignored my friend after we were done cooking, which was kind of an ass move on my part. We didn't talk until the next semester, which was just this month.

Now this semester, we have a thesis coming up so we had to group ourselves into groups of 5 people. Our friend group had 6 people in it and I was sort of hoping they would put me in their group, but I was of course left out. I low-key expected that tbh but I was still bummed. Luckily I was able to form a group with my other classmates.

It's been maybe a week since that happened, but I feel like that's probably the biggest reason why I feel so unmotivated to, yk, keep studying this semester. I usually like going to school but this semester I feel so drained and tired and a little alone. I know somewhere down the line I was an ass to them to an extent but I feel like I'm being shut out by who I thought were my friends and groupmates

They haven't talked to me much as well and I really just don't know how to go from here. 

What do I do? Do I confront them? (I don't want to), do I just let them do their thing and I'll do mine? I need advice üò≠üôè",1,1756210826.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

1n0k8d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1n0k8d9/explore_pure_organic_ingredients_washing_soda_is/,Explore Pure Organic Ingredients washing soda is it worth using daily,"**A First-Hand Experience with Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda**

Using the Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda has become a part of my daily cleaning routine, and I must say, it delivers on multiple levels. Hearing so much about its versatility, I initially picked it up because of its claims of being a hypoallergenic, non-toxic solution that could handle a variety of cleaning tasks. Packaged conveniently in Utah, USA, I felt that this product deserved a shot in my eco-conscious household.

**An Eco-Friendly Design that Doesn‚Äôt Compromise Functionality**  
The first thing I noticed when this product arrived was its practical and no-frills packaging. The 2 lb package is compact yet sufficient for a plethora of uses. Its simple design screams utility, which I appreciate since the focus remains on what's inside. For someone like me trying to cut down on chemical-laden products, the fact that it contains no additives is a huge plus. The hypoallergenic properties make it safe for anyone sensitive to harsh chemicals, and I‚Äôve even used it on delicate cleaning tasks without a hitch.

[Looking for Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b06y3c8wkj/)

**Performance That Surpasses Expectations**  
Calling it a multipurpose cleaner feels like an understatement. I‚Äôve used this washing soda in various ways; from softening the hard water in my laundry to scrubbing out stubborn stains on tile surfaces, it doesn‚Äôt fail to impress. A notable mention: tough coffee stains on kitchen counters? Gone in no time after mixing this with warm water. It's satisfying to have one product that can handle so many jobs. While I haven‚Äôt tested it in every conceivable scenario, its performance has been more consistent than many branded, single-purpose cleaning products I‚Äôve used before.

**Ease of Use While Remaining effective**  
Mixing this powder with water, creating DIY cleaning paste, or even adding it to my laundry routine is a breeze. The sodium carbonate works particularly well in boosting the effectiveness of regular detergent, making everything come out cleaner, especially in hard water situations. Even my coworker started using it after I raved about how fresh-smelling my linens were post-wash. It‚Äôs not a miracle worker where heavy grime is concerned, but for everyday cleaning jobs, it keeps life simple and manageable.

**Strengths**  
Here‚Äôs why I think everyone should give this product a chance:

- The pure ingredients ensure no harmful additives or questionable substances.  
- Works great as a water softener, especially in hard water scenarios.  
- Perfect for DIY enthusiasts looking for a customizable, eco-friendly cleaner.  

**Limitations**  
No product is perfect, and there are a few areas where this washing soda could improve:

- The packaging lacks resealability, which can make storing it a bit tricky without transferring it to a separate container.  
- Some users might find the powder‚Äôs consistency slightly coarse for specific applications.  

**Product Comparisons with Market Rivals**  
Comparing the Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda to traditional store-bought multipurpose cleaners, one clear advantage is its purity. Unlike some competitors that include chemical blends, fragrances, and artificial agents, this product keeps it clean and straightforward. While brands like Arm & Hammer also offer washing soda products, I found their formulations to be less focused on the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúpure‚Äù aspect. This product‚Äôs hypoallergenic advantage makes it perfect for households with sensitive skin‚Äîa qualifying point the competition sometimes misses.

However, if I need to deep-clean something, like an oven or severely stained outdoor furniture, I might lean toward a heavy-duty product specifically designed for that purpose. Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda holds its ground in day-to-day, eco-friendly cleaning but isn‚Äôt necessarily one-size-fits-all.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For a budget-conscious individual, this product is a smart investment. Its versatility and the sheer number of uses make it cost-effective in the long run. Compared to pricier chemical-heavy cleaners that need to be bought separately for specific tasks, this sodium carbonate powder simplifies things while saving you serious money over time. Though it won‚Äôt stretch to meet every possible cleaning need, what it does cover is significant enough to deem it worth every penny.

1n0k7qo,https://i.redd.it/p8r6pb1ovclf1.png,Succo anguria e caff√® freddo,"Il succo di anguria e caff√® freddo √® un drink rinfrescante e insolito, perfetto per l'estate. La dolcezza e la freschezza dell'anguria si sposano inaspettatamente bene con il sapore intenso e amaro del caff√®.
Ecco una ricetta semplice per prepararlo a casa.
Ingredienti
 * 300 g di anguria senza semi
 * 80 ml di caff√® espresso (o caff√® della moka) freddo
 * Ghiaccio
 * Zucchero o sciroppo d'agave (facoltativo, a seconda della dolcezza dell'anguria)
 * Foglie di menta o una fetta di limone per guarnire (facoltativo)
Preparazione
 * Prepara il succo di anguria: Taglia l'anguria a cubetti, rimuovi la buccia e i semi. Metti i cubetti in un frullatore e frulla fino a ottenere un succo liscio e omogeneo. Se preferisci, puoi filtrarlo con un colino a maglie fini per eliminare eventuali fibre residue.
 * Prepara il caff√®: Prepara il caff√® espresso o con la moka e lascialo raffreddare completamente.
 * Unisci gli ingredienti: Riempi un bicchiere alto con il ghiaccio. Versa il succo di anguria fino a riempire circa met√† del bicchiere. Se l'anguria non √® abbastanza dolce, aggiungi un po' di zucchero o sciroppo e mescola bene.
 * Aggiungi il caff√®: Con delicatezza, versa il caff√® freddo sopra il succo di anguria. Il caff√®, essendo pi√π denso, rimarr√† sopra il succo, creando un bellissimo effetto a strati.
 * Servi: Puoi mescolare prima di bere, o gustare gli strati separatamente. Guarnisci con una foglia di menta o una fetta di limone per un tocco in pi√π.
Consigli
 * Per un sapore pi√π intenso, puoi usare il caff√® preparato a freddo (cold brew).
 * Se vuoi una versione pi√π cremosa, puoi aggiungere un goccio di latte di cocco o una spruzzata di panna vegetale in cima.
 * Assicurati che sia il succo di anguria che il caff√® siano ben freddi prima di unirli.
 * Per un tocco estivo, puoi preparare dei cubetti di ghiaccio con il succo di anguria e usarli al posto del ghiaccio normale.

1n0k78z,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1n0k78z/my_experience_as_an_african_dn/,My Experience as an African DN,"I started my digital nomad journey earlier this year, and I‚Äôve been on the road for about 8 months now. Before starting, I heard so many inspiring stories and was really excited but one thing I didn‚Äôt realize later was that most of the people I spoke to weren‚Äôt African.

In the past 8 months, I‚Äôve traveled through 10 countries across Africa and Southeast Asia. As an African (I don't have residency anywhere else), it was somewhat easier moving around different countries in Africa, but the challenges were huge. There was poor infrastructure (internet, electricity, coffee shops, etc) in many places and extremely high costs in others. Flying across Africa is also crazily expensive!

When I got to Southeast Asia, the difference was massive. The infrastructure here is way better compared to the other countries I visited. Fast internet, tons of coffee shops, co-working spaces, and stable electricity. And the hospitality I have experienced here has been unmatched.

But my passport has been the biggest barrier. I can only enter the Philippines and Singapore without extreme hassle. Even then, both immigration singled me out for interviews. I had to show them documents, private chats with some contacts I had and even proof of my work emails. Sometimes they called my hotel to confirm I have a booking or called a friend and asked if they will really be meeting me while I am in the country.

Vietnam was amazing, but I had to pay an exorbitant fee (6x the cost) for a short 30-day visa (the only one available to me). Crossing into Cambodia by land from Vietnam was even worse; immigration there was such a frustrating experience that I almost turned back entirely.

I love the culture, the people, and the lifestyle in SEA, but the strict immigration rules for people with African passports and my low finances makes it really tough. Honestly, the whole experience has been enriching, but if you‚Äôre African and thinking of doing the digital nomad thing, you‚Äôll need thick skin and a lot of money.

  
Edit: I also found that having other western visas on your passport helps. Before my DN life, I travelled to Europe and the US a few times so I have those stickers on my passport. I suspect it will be almost impossible if you had a fresh passport.",35,1756210540.0,digitalnomad,23,0.86,False
1n0k735,https://i.redd.it/64jb2o8kvclf1.jpeg,I got mindful about sugar,"The change in my energy has been insane. I went from needing a nap every afternoon to having steady, consistent energy all day long.

**The hardest Things to cut out**

My Morning Coffee: I used to load it with flavored creamer, which is basically just sugar syrup. The first few days of black coffee were rough.

* The Swap: Now I use a splash of unsweetened almond milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. It‚Äôs creamy, tastes amazing, and has zero sugar.

""Healthy"" Snacks: My go-to was granola bars. I was shocked when I read the label and saw how much sugar was packed in there.

* The Swap: A handful of almonds and an apple. It gives me actual energy instead of a sugar spike and crash.

Late-Night Cravings: My biggest weakness was a bowl of ice cream before bed.

* The Swap: A bowl of Greek yogurt with some fresh berries. It satisfies the craving for something creamy and sweet without derailing my progress.

And I can't forget my Daily Meditation. When a craving hits, taking just a few minutes to breathe helps me realize I'm probably just stressed or bored, not actually hungry.

**And here‚Äôs the thing that really hit me:** it‚Äôs not just about the sugar itself, it‚Äôs about how much we‚Äôre being pushed toward it every single day. Advertisers know exactly how to wear us down. They design ads and packaging to hit us at our weakest moments, and it‚Äôs no coincidence that low-income neighborhoods and minorities are targeted more aggressively by companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and fast-food giants. It‚Äôs basically social engineering, nudging us into behaviors that keep the consumer machine running while wrecking our health.
