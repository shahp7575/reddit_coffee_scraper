Also, english is not my first language.

I'm in my late thirties now, and my HH started when I was around 18.  
It started in my armpits.. I noticed that I started to sweat much more easily than my friends in the summer, but it was 'just' the armpits.  
I will not waste your time with a long timeline of how it evolved, but fast forward to me being in my late thirties now, it is now especially my back and face.  
I live less than 1,5 kilometers (less than 1 mile) from my job and I take my bike to work, and no matter what time of year it is, I have to arrive 30 minutes before my shift starts, because I have to take off all my clothes when I arrive, and just sit there in the locker room, sweating and steaming, before I put on my work clothes.  
I'm still moist and feel disgusting when I put on my work clothes, but it's a little less than if I arrive 5 minutes before my shift starts.  
Antiperspirants are not an option, as my most severe area is my back and face, but make no mistake, I sweat all over my body.

The most relief I have found, is from Glyco. If I take 4 mg. on an empty stomach, and don't eat anything for 2 hours, I do get a gigantic relief for about 5-6 hours.  
The problem is that I'm also on Vyvanse because of my ADD, and with Vyvanse I get a much longer og better effect if I eat something with fats and protein, 30 minutes after I take the dose.  
So when I have to be at work at 6 in the morning, I wake up at 4 to take my Vyvanse and Glyco, and one medication calls for not eating for the next 2 hours, and the other works much better if I eat shortly after.  
Also, both medications contributes to cotton mouth, and therefore I'm now much more prone to cavities in my teeth.   


I haven't heard of a glyco prescription in my country (I'm in scandinavia), so I have to buy it online from an online pharmacy, and it's so f\*\*\*ing expensive.. And on top of that, I have to pay Value Added Tax when it arrives in my country, which is even more money.  
And all of this I'm doing, is just to function almost like a normal human being.

It's so lonely to be a work in the summertime, and look around at your colleagues that arrive 5 minutes before the shift starts, sitting there drinking coffee og laughing, without a sweat stain anywhere.  
Meanwhile I'm a medicated mess, that has to avoid the caffeine because of my sweat glands (even though I love coffee), and have to take so many measures, all day, every day.

Sorry for just rambling and venting, but I can't get this off my chest anywhere else.  
To all other sufferers in this sub: Trust me, I know the struggle.

But first, let‚Äôs have a look at what this post will cover.

# BASICS Of Amazon PPC

Let us get acquainted with the basics for understanding a PPC Campaign.

# What is Amazon PPC?

Amazon PPC is an attention-grabbing and powerful marketing platform sponsored by Amazon itself. It allows professional sellers to run advertising campaigns by indexing keywords to their product listings for increased visibility ‚Äî either in search results or on a competitor‚Äôs product page. If you do everything correctly, it also helps achieve higher organic rankings.

In simple terms, Amazon PPC (Pay-Per-Click) is an advertising service that enables you to run sponsored product ads so your listings can show up on page one search results using specific keywords. As the name suggests, you only pay when a consumer clicks on your advertisement.

When you receive orders through the keywords used in your¬†[PPC campaign](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service), Amazon begins to index those keywords to your product. Over time, this improves your organic keyword ranking, meaning PPC not only drives sales ‚Äî it helps you grow sustainably.

On a side note, PPC can be best utilized when your listing already has a few numbers of reviews.

# 

When you receive orders through the keywords used in your PPC campaign, Amazon begins to index those keywords to your product. Over time, this improves your organic keyword ranking, meaning PPC not only drives sales ‚Äî it helps you grow sustainably.

Pro Tip: Many sellers partner with an expert¬†[**Amazon PPC agency**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†to structure campaigns strategically, manage keyword bidding, and optimize performance ‚Äî especially in competitive niches.

Whether you‚Äôre managing this yourself or utilizing professional¬†[**Amazon PPC services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service), the goal is the same: to boost product visibility, increase conversions, and ultimately dominate organic rankings once you‚Äôve built up enough momentum through ads.

On a side note,¬†[**Amazon PPC**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†can be best utilized when your listing already has¬†**a few solid reviews**¬†‚Äî this builds trust and makes your ad clicks more likely to convert into sales.

# How Does Amazon PPC Work?

The concept behind Amazon PPC Ads isn‚Äôt as complicated as it sounds. Here is a quick review of what shows up on Amazon when millions of buyers hit enter with various searches each month. Buyers type either small search terms or, most frequently, a string of words entered to get specific results.

The longer string of keywords is called¬†[long-tail keywords](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-ranking), otherwise just keywords. Once they hit enter, Amazon‚Äôs algorithm stirs into motion and retrieves a list of search results that match the search term as specifically as possible.

The products you see in the results will have one of two sources or reasons to be there: Organic or Paid.¬†[Amazon PPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service), as discussed above, deals with paid sponsored products. Both types of results have a place at the top. However, paid results may appear more than once on the page.

They can appear above organic results, between them, on either side, or even below a product‚Äôs organic listing on its selling page. Sponsored ads, their types, and their positioning will be discussed shortly. For now, let‚Äôs focus on the mechanism.

Amazon PPC functions on the basis of an enhanced auction-based approach. Vendors and sellers bid on keywords that buyers are likely to use to search for products. A daily budget is set for each keyword. The method of keyword selection is entirely up to you.

You can either let Amazon fetch relevant keywords based on your listing or enter them manually. The chances of your ad displaying increase as you bid higher, just like any auction. The lower your bids, the lower the chances your ad will show. You can always adjust your keyword bids throughout the campaign based on the profits they generate. Every time your ad is clicked, you pay for it.

# Places Where You Can Target Your Brand PPC Ad

You‚Äôve seen ads on Amazon featuring arrays of products and brands. They appear in different places and formats, as mentioned above. Amazon offers three main types of ads for targeting your advertisements: Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brand, and Display Ads. Each ad type has different positioning, costs, conversion rates, and click-through rates (CTR).

Before choosing which type to go for, keep in mind your product type, target audience, and objectives. All three ad types serve specific purposes:

* **Sponsored Products Ads**¬†are best for targeting shoppers with purchase intent.
* **Sponsored Brand Ads**¬†are excellent for promoting brand awareness and image.
* **Product Display Ads**¬†serve both product promotion and audience targeting.

**Sponsored Products Ads ‚Äì**¬†Sponsored Products Ads are very effective in increasing CTR and conversion rates because they blend seamlessly among organic results ‚Äî right on page one, at the top, and between listings ‚Äî where about 45% of buyers purchase from. If you don‚Äôt read the ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù label carefully, you might mistake these for organic results. These ads can also appear below organic results, on the sides, or on product detail pages.

They integrate so naturally into the search results that it‚Äôs almost impossible to miss them. It‚Äôs crucial to perform deep keyword research so your ads can mimic organic results flawlessly. Once you allocate bids on carefully selected keywords, Amazon decides when and where to display your ad to reach the right audience. Sponsored Products Ads are not only effective but also roughly 3x cheaper than Google AdWords.

**Product Display Ads ‚Äì**¬†When you visit a product page, you may notice ads in the ‚Äúsimilar products‚Äù section. For customers, it offers additional options; for sellers, it provides insights into customer behavior and needs. Product Display Ads contain products similar to the one occupying the page organically and are paired with its ASIN. They target specific audiences, categories, interests, and related listings.

**Sponsored Brand Ads ‚Äì**¬†Sponsored Brand Ads appear at the very top of search results, featuring brand logos and customized messages to promote brand image or awareness. Their prime placement makes them nearly impossible to miss. Though visibility is limited to certain product categories, these ads offer the widest range of customization options for sellers.

You have the option to display your banner in the way that is most favorable to you. Pick out your own images or text to display. Banner ads allow you to display your products collectively so the customer gets a bigger impression and more choices from your brand.

Here are some important PPC terms you should familiarize yourself with.

**Impressions ‚Äì**¬†An impression is when a PPC ad is viewed by the consumer.  
**Clicks ‚Äì**¬†When a customer clicks your ad, its called a click.  
**CTR (Click-Through-Rate) ‚Äì**¬†The ratio of how many times visitors click on your product advertisement when it‚Äôs displayed.¬† CTR is calculated through a division of clicks by impressions.  
**CPC (Cost-Per-Click) ‚Äì**¬†The average amount paid for each click on an ad is called CPC.  
**ACOS (Advertising-Cost-Of-Sale) ‚Äì**¬†ACOS is used to measure the performance of a PPC Campaign. Calculated by an advertisement‚Äôs cost that is spent divided by the sales achieved.

# Prerequisites Of Running The Best PPC

Running a successful PPC campaign is not about how much money you can throw on Amazon sponsored ads and just hope for the best. It requires serious effort, proper attention, and of course certain prerequisites without which you don‚Äôt stand a chance.

There are simply two conditions you must meet before you rely on¬†[**Amazon PPC Services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†to rocket your sales.

# Attractive Listing

It won‚Äôt matter a dime if you spend hundreds on the promotion of your product but fail to make a quality listing. One disappointing look at a sad state of a picture, overly complicated title or poor content can discourage your potential buyer to slip back into the cracks. If you are spending money to promote something, it is obvious that it needs to be worthy, else why would the visitor turn into a customer? A strong impression needs to be made so your campaign can actually turn clicks into sales.

# High Demanding And Relevant Keywords

You need keywords that would drive most traffic and sales to your listing. If you are using keywords that have fallen behind or have no relevance to your product, your listing will not appear or be visible to consumers when they search for that same product, hence rendering your¬†[**Amazon PPC Services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†useless.

If you want to maximize results, consider hiring an¬†[**Amazon PPC Agency**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†that specializes in optimizing your campaigns for better ROI.

# How To Find The Right Keywords For My PPC Campaign?

Modern problems require modern solutions. Keyword research is a crucial step in building a strong and effective listing. This is why I will recommend that you should take assistance from some of the up-to-date, fast, and reliable keyword tools.

Keyword tools not only list down but offer various mechanisms by which you can sort out the keyword lists of your own choice. You may extract competitor keywords or keywords of your own and then proceed to filter out keywords that have high search volumes, top organic rankings, or most sales. In other words, you have to make three keyword lists that will sort the category of Keywords that are Highly Relevant, Medium Relevant and Low Relevant for your¬†[**Amazon PPC Services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†campaign.

If you wish to read more on keyword research, check out our blog on Tips for¬†[Amazon Keyword Research](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-ranking).

**Difference Between Automatic And Manual Targeting**

When you start an ad campaign, Amazon charges you with the decision to either pick automatic targeting or manual targeting of keywords. If you opt for automatic targeting, Amazon will target ads to all relevant customer searches using your product‚Äôs information including its category, related products, and keywords that you have used in your listing.

On the other hand, if you go with manual targeting, you can manually select all the keywords you would like to bid on, choosing different match types for keywords. You control everything now, but it requires constant monitoring. Some keywords will go on to have low relevancy and if they are not driving traffic to your sale, you can lower your bid on it to effectively manage your campaign.

This step is crucial whether you manage your ads yourself or work with an¬†[**Amazon PPC Agency**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†to optimize your campaigns.

# Understanding Types Of Keywords

# Broad Match Keyword

Broad match scoops up everything there is related to your indexed keywords which means that your ad will show up when Amazon shopper types in anything related to your keywords. Let‚Äôs suppose you are selling coffee mugs. If you include the keyword ‚Äúcoffee mug‚Äù in your ad campaign, then your ad may come up if the customer types in ‚Äúmug coffee,‚Äù ‚Äúdiner mug,‚Äù ‚Äúcoffee cup,‚Äù or even a synonym like ‚Äúhot liquid cup,‚Äù or a misspelling like, ‚Äúcoffee mug.‚Äù Resulting in a broad result.

# Phrase Match Keywords

Phrase Match is concerned with long-tail keywords. A longtail keyword is a keyword that is three words or longer, or at least very specific. Whenever a customer uses a highly specific search phrase, they usually already know exactly what they want to buy and therefore long-tail keywords tend to have a higher conversion rate (they result in more purchases) even though their monthly search volume is less (they are searched fewer times in a month).

Phrase match will strip out linking words but keeps the sequence of your keyword. For example, if your keyword phrase is ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs for women,‚Äù then a customer can search ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs women‚Äù and your listing will show up on the search results page. This is because ‚Äúfor‚Äù is a linking word, and phrase matches ignore those words. However, if the customer searched ‚Äúcoffee mugs green for women‚Äù then your listing will not show up on the results page because the sequence of your keyword was changed.

Prepositions, articles, and conjunctions like and, a, of the, in, out, for, and on would be considered linking words.

# Exact Match Keywords

Exact match keywords are exactly as the name suggests: the customer‚Äôs search term must match your keyword exactly in order for your ad to populate on the search results page. For example, if your keyword is ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs with a cartoon,‚Äù and your customer types in ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs cartoon,‚Äù then your ad will not show up.

Be very careful when using an exact match, because one little misspell or a keyword not thoroughly planned well could result in no one typing in your exact keywords phrase and your ad will accomplish nothing.

For the same reason, when dropping in negative keywords that you do not want pulling up your ad, make sure you use an exact match, otherwise, you could be ruling out similar keywords that you want to trigger your ad.

# Why Should You Go For Amazon PPC?

There are multiple ways to achieve sales, PPC still stands to be one of the best and most effective methods. Here are a few reasons why.

There are many companies that claim to extract the Amazon data using the high to low search volume feature, etc. but in reality, PPC is the only platform through which you can get the most accurate data. PPC stands on Amazon‚Äôs very own ground, so there is no doubt that any data you use from PPC in favor of your advertising campaign, will provide the most reliable and trustworthy results.

PPC allows you to target a highly specific audience which means more control to you over who gets to see your message. Targeting the exact demographics like age, location, etc. It centers a strategic play based on what your audience wants to see.

PPC delivers faster results because amazon sponsored ads are right on the Amazon website. Buyers come straight to Amazon when they need to purchase something, having ads next to the purchasing platform makes sales rate naturally higher. Not only does it drives the sales but it also helps with branding and visibility.

# Intermediate

If you are already familiar with the¬†[Amazon PPC basics](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how_to_do_amazon_ppc_optimization/), let us move on to other pressing matters. Even when you have sufficient information, sometimes you encounter certain mind-boggling situations which can cause a hindrance in running a successful amazon business.

Below I‚Äôll explore all situations which may be the reasons you might be experiencing difficulty with¬†[Amazon PPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-amazon-ppc-strategies-for-maximizing-your-advertising-roi/).

# What To Do When:

# 1. When You Have Impressions But No Clicks

If your PPC campaigns are making customer impressions but you are still not getting any clicks you must be wondering what is it that you are doing wrong. There are a couple of reasons why this mishap may be occurring. Any of the reasons or together they could be preventing clicks.

Let‚Äôs begin with a keyword bidding that‚Äôs too low. Say, Amazon recommends a keyword‚Äôs bid $2 but you go cheap and bid 0.55 cents. This will likely result in the listing to appear on the back pages, where even if someone gets an impression, they won‚Äôt click it because they want the best of the best, that is page one products.

Next up, you have to take the relevancy of the products into consideration. If you have indexed keywords with low relevancy it is pretty simple that people will have lower chances of making a search by that keyword. For example, your product ‚Äògreen coffee mugs‚Äô is indexed with a low relevant keyword such as ‚Äòcups‚Äô. Now first-page search results may not necessarily list all cups/mugs in green color as your keyword says.

To determine¬†**keyword relevancy**¬†here‚Äôs a quick guide.

It could also be that your listing is present in an irrelevant category or perhaps an incorrect subcategory. For example, you have listed your product ‚ÄòGreen Coffee Mugs‚Äô in the category of Kindle store or Electronics, where this product has absolutely no business being. A customer is not going to search or find this product in the relevant areas. Similarly, even with the right category ‚ÄòHome and Kitchen‚Äô, you can mistakenly end up with a wrong subcategory such as ‚Äòbedding‚Äô instead of ‚Äòkitchen and dining‚Äô.

Sometimes sellers make an error with keyword usage in the title of their listing. The Exact and Phrase Match Keywords in your campaign may not be written in the exact order as in the title of your listing. To review the issue with an example, your product says ‚ÄòGreen Coffee Mugs‚Äô in the title but your exact keyword indexed is ‚ÄòCoffee Mugs‚Äô or your phrase match keyword says ‚Äò Green New Coffee Mugs‚Äô.

Having low search volume keywords in your listing could be another reason why your listing is getting impressons but still no clicks. The fewer people are searching using your keyword, the fewer chances of impressions and even less of getting clicks because once again your product might have been pushed back from page 1 where most of the sales occur.

You have to be vigilant of every little detail you enter about your product. It could change the entire game.

# 2. When You Have Clicks But No Sales

This might seem more puzzling than it actually is. When you are apparently doing everything right and even receiving clicks but still are not getting any sales, it could mean one of two things. Either your listing isn‚Äôt good enough or it is not differentiated enough.

Potential buyers may click on your listing but they could be immediately discouraged because your listing wasn‚Äôt attractive enough. Make sure to create a listing that has not only sufficient information but also a certain appeal to buyers‚Äô lifestyles. Give shoppers a reason to buy your product over the competitors.

Include quality content, attractive images, and solid selling points. You have to make them stick long enough to agree with your offers, so they may actually buy instead of discarding it.

Sometimes, even when you have an attractive listing you don‚Äôt get sales because your product is drowning among the masses. It needs to stand out, in simple terms. Little things such as the main image could change the outcome of the sales. A listing that exclusively offers something others don‚Äôt will surely stand out and drive more sales.

# 3. When Your ACOS Is Too High

# 

Your advertising cost of sale ideally should be less than your profit margin. If your ACOS is coming up to 10-20% it‚Äôs a good spend. Otherwise, it proves a more damaging result than your amount to actual sales. In the case, you are struggling with a high ACOS, here might be a few reasons to ponder through.

Your ACOS status depends on the stage you are in when launching a product. If you have just launched your product, say within 10-30 days, the ACoS should not be your concern right now. It‚Äôs too early to be worrying about ACOS being high because that‚Äôs just how it goes in the early stages. Once you‚Äôve crossed that duration, its time to closely monitor it.

A sensible strategy is to lower your bids on low to medium relevant keywords as they may be costing you a lot of money for a very low return. If a keyword isn‚Äôt driving sales as much it should be, there is no point in pouring excessive money after it. Go for the suggested bid or lower it yourself as you might see fit.

Make sure that you have selected the correct match type for your keywords. Irrelevant selection of keyword match type can result in high¬†**ACOS**¬†because your product is being advertised in the wrong or irrelevant areas where no one is supposed to be looking or buying your product. It is kind of a waste that may slip by unnoticed. Keeping a close eye on where and how your money is spent is a start to managing effective ACOS.

# CTR Scale (Click-Through-Rate)

A 0.7-1% CTR is minimum  
1-2% CTR is good  
2-5% CTR is excellent  
5%+ CTR is exceptional.

This is a general guideline and may change with the category you are selling in.

# When Can You Stop Pushing PPC And Start Relying On Organic Sales?

Shutting off a PPC Campaign is not recommended even when you have achieved high organic rankings, but rather it is suggested that we simply lower the bids. Being in the top 10 search results is a good indication that your product is doing well and you can start lowering your PPC expenses. But being in the list of top 5 is the ideal state. Again, this depends on the market for your product category.

Although you are now on the first half of page one results, PPC is still favorable to you in terms of keeping you updated about newer and highly relevant keywords that buyers are using to make purchases. Keeping a PPC campaign running, is always a good idea because it grants you not only top but double visibility on page one. The more exposure of your product on the Amazon website, the better.

# Expert

# Latest PPC Strategies ‚Äì 3 Types Of Bidding

# Dynamic bids ( Down Only)

The strategy is to opt for a setting in your PPC campaign where you only go down on the bids. Lowering your bids in real-time when your PPC ad may have fewer chances of converting sales. Once you have selected this option, there is no raising it back up again, it only goes down.

# Dynamic Bids (Up and Down)

This strategy is concerned with a dynamic setting. Either you raise your bids (by a maximum of 100%) in real-time when your keyword may be likely to convert to a sale or lower your bids when your keyword is less likely to convert sales. It depends on the situation of your campaign, which strategy you should go for.

# Fixed Bids

As the name suggests, your exact bids and any manual adjustments you set remains throughout the campaign, and it will not readjust your bids based on the likelihood of a sale, as it would in the above-mentioned strategies.

My wife and I are doing our first big move and are renting a 26ft Penske truck to do so.

I'm a high school senior from South Korea, and I've been teaching myself how to code. 

The idea was to create a ""dual-brain"" challenge. With your right hand, you play a classic game of Tetris (Arrow Keys + Space), featuring the '7-bag' system for fair piece distribution. With your left hand (A/W/D), you control a player at the bottom who has to dodge the very blocks you're dropping. It gets chaotic pretty quickly!

You can play it right in your browser here:¬†**\[**¬†[**https://splitris.online/**](https://splitris.online/)¬†**\]**

I wasn't planning on adopting yet. But in a corner, away from the others, there was a long-haired gray cat with a bent ear, one eye permanently closed, and a clear leave me alone attitude. His sign said, Doesn't like to be touched, has been here for 9 months.

Obviously, I fell in love immediately üòÇ

I adopted him that same day. I named him Sir Grunts, for obvious reasons. The first few days, he hid behind the refrigerator. Then he moved from hiding place to hiding place, like a grumpy ninja. But he never scratched or attacked me. He just watched... from afar.

Little by little, he came closer. First to 3 meters. Then to 2. Until one night, while I was working late, I felt a weight on my legs: Sir Grunts had decided that I was acceptable!

Today, I can't sit on the couch without him climbing on me and purring. Sometimes he still has his noble indifference, but he's a total sweetheart. He follows me around the house, sits next to me while I read, and even brings me his toys as gifts. ü•π

I just wanted to share this because sometimes difficult cats just need time... and a chance üíõ

Maybe you can brew a gallon of iced tea or cold-brew coffee which you can then use to craft individual cocktails. Maybe you measure out a pitcher of cocktail mix, then freeze it in handy portions for later mixological convenience.

a little background as to what she has done
- told me she should be the most important person in my husbands life
- wanted my husband to make her coffee and breakfast every morning when we lived with them and would throw a giant fit if he didn‚Äôt, and then would get extremely jealous if he made me food
- said she wanted to quit her job and raise my baby
- thought it was fine to say that she thought her and my fil should be able to name the baby
- texted me that i was distant and want making enough time for them when we moved out because i was doing school full time and working and i was also pregnant last year
- would bother me to see her so she could ‚Äúsee my belly‚Äù not me apparently just my belly when i was pregnant
- kept asking my husband for money when we moved out even though we had alot of bills and things to pay for, she only stopped now that we have a baby
- kept texting me when i moved out asking where i was if i was at work and where my hand was like every day, and she would only text me to ask me those things
- keeps asking to use my work discount even thought ive told her multiple times it will get me fired but she still asks and tells other family members of theirs that they can also use it and she asks for them
- keeps giving me clothes that are ‚Äútoo big‚Äù for her
- kept asking that she wanted to stay with us for a week of me with them after having the baby even when i said multiple times i wanted to have privacy in my apartment alone, and then proceeded to be angry at me when i didn‚Äôt want visitors for awhile so i could rest, mind you i tore so i felt terrible and disgusting and extremely tired
- told me i needed to share my baby ( she wanted to babysit) less than a week after having my baby
- said she and my fil should be able to take my baby on vacation in a few months right after i had my baby
- kept telling my i should use formula because i wouldn‚Äôt produce enough even though i started multiple times i was going to breastfeed
- would walk off with my baby to her room and try to close the door when we went to their house
- she make me feel like im rude if i hold my baby, and has said no when i ask for him back
- they demand weekly visits or even ask to see us multiple times a week, which could be cultural ig, but didn‚Äôt care before we had a baby. and the thing is they expect us to host them and have a clean apartment and stuff while at have a new baby. they literally just want to come and hold him and leave
- texts my husband every day and that gets mad if he doesn‚Äôt respond immediately 
- she also asked me if we had done it since i gave birth like 4 weeks postpartum and was asking about our birth control plans
- also keeps asking if we are going to have another baby because she wants a girl even though im tryna finish college
- i did ask her to give me space and told her that she overwhelms me and i feel like she doesn‚Äôt respect me, to which she proceeded to text me every day after that and ask to see us even more and got upset when i said no and stopped texting her back
- she doesn‚Äôt listen or seem to respect what i say so i feel like i have to go to extreme measures of not texting her back or not letting her hold my baby because she doesn‚Äôt respect me, and my husband said im acting like im in high school and that we should be mature enough to have a conversation, but when i try she completely does the opposite of what i ask",4,1753358855.0,motherinlawsfromhell,3,1.0,False

Third, if this was Trump's first term, I could see Cameron Collins's case about not wanting to get into foreign wars and eliminating overreach and Trump is the candidate for that and that's why he donated to him. But this isn't his first term, it's his second term, and you don't get that pass anymore. Anything he says now is just spin and damage control. There's the bed you made, go lay down.

Finally...I'm really glad ""Brew Ha Ha Productions"" appears unaffiliated with my local coffee shop, also called ""Brew Ha Ha,"" because I really like their coffee and their cafes always felt very inclusive and progressive and I wasn't looking forward to finding a new spot.

Small talk used to be something I could avoid. Now? It‚Äôs at the coffee machine. The elevator.¬†

Here are skills that helped from [Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king)

**1. Preparation is the key**One small trick I learned: prep 2‚Äì3 casual topics in advance. It could be something I watched, weekend plans, a local event. When my brain goes blank, I have something to fall back on.

2. **The 1:1:1 Method** This one saved me during awkward moments: ‚Ä¢ Say hi to **1 person** ‚Ä¢ Ask **1 question** (e.g., ‚ÄúAny fun weekend plans?‚Äù) ‚Ä¢ Share **1 thing** (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to survive Monday without caffeine‚Äù) Do it once a day. Low-stakes, high payoff.

**3. Following up matters**¬†

¬†If starting a conversation feels hard, try this: don‚Äôt start one. Just listen carefully. Pick up something the other person mentioned, and follow up later. That won‚Äôt let the conversation die awkwardly either.

**4. Behavior first, comfort second** Waiting until I ‚Äúfeel ready‚Äù never worked. And honestly, the silence in those moments? Painful. So I started with just a ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. I stopped overthinking what to say and began treating small talk like a simple greeting, not a performance. Turns out, acting confident is often the first step to actually becoming confident.

If small talk makes your skin crawl, you just need a few tools. I also read [Fine Art of Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-fine-art-of-small-talk-by-debra-fine), which gets a deeper understanding of small talk. I highly recommend it if you're trying to rebuild your social muscles post-WFH.",0,1753358290.0,office,0,0.5,False

Until the next message that came through from Amber was a picture of my boyfriend, Derek, and her in bed together.

They were undressed, and Derek was behind Amber, leaning over her, while she was on all fours. It was very obvious from the picture of what they were doing.

\[What is this?\] I had no idea how to respond to this. I felt like my heart was in my throat, and I was doing everything I could to fight back the tears.

He told me that he was working. But what‚Äôs this?

I can‚Äôt help thinking how many of those times he slept with her and then came home and slept with me.

I feel so gross. I heard his car pull into the drive.

A wild plan came to my mind.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

OAKLEY

I sit in the darkness of the livingroom of the home I share with my mate, the beta of the moon river pack, Derek Wright. It's late.

Probably after midnight. I can't bring myself away from the window to check the time as I watch for his homecoming. I am praying to the moon goddess that nothing bad has happened to him and that his phone just died.

Hoping he just got caught up in his work and that's why he didn't contact me to let me know he would be late.I pull myself out of my thoughts of horrible things happening and decide to get changed for bed. I put on my comfy, soft pink pajama pants and a plain black night shirt. I pull my long blonde hair into a bun and brush my teeth.

Once I have completed all my nightly, before bed routine, I find myself back in the darkness of the livingroom. I sit in the window seat and stare out the window.Haven, my wolf, has been pacing in my head, a feeling of unease coming from her. I don't dare to ask her what is wrong because I fear her answer. I also cannot ask her to stop pacing, despite the headache it's beginning to give me, because I understand why she is pacing.I try reaching out to Derek through the mind link for what feels like the hundredth time only to be met with silence.

If we were marked and mated then I would be able to feel him, feel his emotions. I would know if something was wrong. But Derek insisted we wait. He won't tell me why or when but just that he is waiting for the right time.

Everyone knows that we are fated mates. It's not a secret. As soon as we discovered we were mates he insisted I move in with him. I attended beta training with his mother. She treated me like I was a daughter and also said I was excelling at beta training.I was so lost in thought that I nearly jumped out of my skin when my phone dinged, signaling a text message. I pick it up to see a message from my half sister, Amber.

When I was little my mother was killed in a rogue attack protecting the alphas wife. My dad was devistated. For a few years it was just us but he decided to take a chosen mate, Bailey. For a few years everything was good. She was kind to me and treated me like a daughter. Until she had Amber. After that, whenever my dad was not around they would treat me like I was their slave. Bailey would tell me that I could not say anything to my father because I would destroy his happiness and it would make me selfish. I didn't want to see my dad upset again.

I remember what it was like when my mom died and how he could barely function at first.I'm a little surprised that she is texting me since we barely speak to each other. She is probably at a party and is drunk. Why else would she text me? Deciding I could use this as a temporary distraction I open up the message.Amber: hello big sister.Oakley: what do you want?Amber: is that any way to talk to your sister?Oakley: if you don't have an actual reason for texting me then goodbye.Amber: oh, but I have a reason.Amber: I just wanted to thank you.Oakley: for what?Amber: for sharing your mate with me.Oakley was confused.

Until the next message that came through from Amber was a picture of Derek and Amber in bed together. They were undressed and Derek was behind Amber, leaning over her, while she was on all fours. It was very obvious by the picture of what they were doing.

I wasn't even sure how she was able to get a picture like that without having someone else take it or setting up a camera.Oakley: what is this?I had no idea how to respond to this. I felt like my heart was in my throat and I was doing everything I could to fight back the tears. Haven was howling in agony in my head.Amber: oh don't be so surprised.

I am far better then you. In everything according to Derek. That is why he will be taking me as his chosen mate and rejecting you.I didn't even bother responding. I knew she was just trying to get under my skin. And it was working too. I felt awful. My mate, my fated mate, was cheating on me with my own sister. And now I understood why he wasnt marking me yet.

Because I would feel every indiscretion. Every time he cheated I would know. But as long as we were not marked I would have no idea. All these times I thought he was just working late. I wondered how many of those times he slept with her and then came home and slept with me. That made me feel so gross and angry. I knew I couldn't stay here any longer.I heard his car pull into the drive. I hurried to the bedroom and got into bed.

There was no way I was going to confront him right now. I needed a plan. I needed some time to think.I could hear Derek come into the house. I hoped he wouldn't come to me because I am not sure how long I could pretend to be asleep and keep it together. It was taking everything I had to not cry and give myself away. I didn't want to hear his excuses.

Haven is sulking in my mind. Going back and fourth between wanting to claw his eyes out to painfully howling.I can hear his heavy footsteps as he gets closer to the bedroom, the floor creaking under his weight.

He comes into the room and pauses for a moment. I don't move, I won't risk him coming to me. After what feels like an eternity, which was probably only seconds, he makes his way into the bathroom. I can hear the shower come on and I breath a sigh of relief, releasing my breath that I don't even realize I was holding in. I was glad he went to shower because I could smell my sisters scent mixed in with his. He was careless this time it seems.

That or I was just to blind to notice. Maybe I was even in denial.

A few times I when I was paranoid and thought he was cheating I had expressed it to him and he always claimed he would never do that, that the fated bond was sacred.""Does he know that Amber sent that picture?"" I think to myself.

Then I am doubtful about it. I decide that I should probably try and get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a really long day. I have a lot to do.

I tossed and turned all night. Knowing that the past year of my life has been nothing but a lie. I wondered who else knew.

I waited for Derek to get up and leave for work. I did not want to even look at him. I knew I would start to cry. I was still not ready to have any conversations with him. As soon as I heard his car pull away I crawled out of bed.

I know the turmoil of emotions I was feeling would not help me to make any good decisions but I also knew that I could not stay here any longer.I headed to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee. Just the thought of eating anything made my stomach turn.

I leaned over the island in the kitchen while I waited for the coffee to be finished and spaced out. I was trying hard not to think about my current situation but thoughts of the past kept coming back to me.

Were there signs of his indiscretions? Was I naive?

I felt so stupid as I thought about all the little red flags that I just ignored. The aroma of coffee hit my nose, pulling me from my thoughts. With a sigh I retrieved my cup, add some creamer to it and then headed back to the bedroom to get dressed and pack up all of my belongings.

I had no idea what I was even going to say to anyone.I put on a pair of blue jeans and a pale pink, form fitting T-shirt.

One of the benefits of being a werewolf was that our bodies were always in shape. Even if we didn't work out we metabolized everything much faster. However, being the daughter of the head warrior of the pack, I was very much in shape.

I grew up learning to fight and keeping up with physical fitness.I went through the house, room by room, gathering all of my belongings and putting them on my bed so I could pack everything. I made sure to leave behind anything Derek had given me. I did not want any reminders of his fake affections. I pulled my duffle bag out of the closet and my suitcases out from underneath the bed. Once I had everything packed I put them by the front door.

My phone buzzed a few times while I was packing. I ignored it because I wanted to get things done quickly. I picked it up to see some missed text messages. One from my dad asking why I was not at training, one from Bailey saying she needed to speak with me, one from Amber saying her mother wanted to talk to me and one from Derek saying he might come home for lunch and that I should consider wearing something revealing.

That last text made my stomach churn and I resisted the urge to vomit. Slipping my phone into my pocket, I grab my bags and head out to my car. I do not want to be here when Derek¬†[arrives.As](http://arrives.as/)¬†I close the trunk after putting my bags in a car pulls up at the end of the driveway. It's Bailey and Amber.""Hello sister."" Amber says in a sickly sweet tone. I have to use all of my self control to not punch her in her stupid face.

All I can see is the picture she sent of my mate and her in bed together. But before I can open my mouth to say anything Bailey speaks.""We need to talk Oakley."" She says.""I don't have anything to say to either of you."" I respond, walking towards the driver side of my car.""Well you might not have anything to say but you will listen."" Bailey says as she steps between me and my car, blocking my path.""What do you want?"" I know that I will not get out of here until they say whatever it is they want.""There is no need to use that tone with me you ungrateful brat.

I am your fathers mate and you will treat me with respect."" Bailey snaps at¬†[me.It](http://me.it/)¬†takes everything in me to not roll my eyes at her. I just stand there waiting for her to continue. When she realizes I am not going to respond she continues on.""Amber will be with Derek now and you will accept his rejection when he rejects you.

You will also not tell anyone that he was cheating on you and that the rejection was your idea. You will not tarnish Derek and Ambers reputation. She is more suited to be a beta's mate then a nobody like you."" Bailey said.I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

There was no way it was going to happen like that. I also knew that there was no way I was going to be able to stay at my dads because they would make life a nightmare for me. I would be treated like a maid when my dad is not around.

I thought Derek was my savior but it turns out I was wrong. And there was no way I was going to impose on my best friend, Erica, when she had just found her mate, Billy, from a neighboring pack. I was super happy for her.I didn't respond and Bailey grabbed my face by the cheeks, squeezing just hard enough for it to hurt but to not leave marks.""Do you understand?"" She asked, looking me dead in the eye with a look of anger in her eyes.I knew that if I said no she would do something bad right then so I decided to just pretend to go along with it for now.

""Yes."" I gritted out between my teeth.

I decided right then that I was going to leave the pack. I would stop at the bank and take out all of my savings and be gone before anyone knew. I would call my dad when I got to my destination. I didn't want him to talk me out of what I was planning on doing. I knew it would hurt him, my leaving without saying anything to him, but I needed to get out of there.""Good."" Bailey spits out as she lets go. The both of them get into Baileys car and drive off. I sigh and get into my car. Haven was trying hard to get out and attack them but I held her back. One thing that a lot of people didn't know was that Haven was massive and strong. She was bigger then a normal wolf. She was more the size of an alpha wolf with pure white fur. I didn't shift in front of anyone. Amber and Bailey were always jealous of Haven so I wasn't allowed to shift in front of them. Though they claim that their wolves are scared of her size but Haven has spoken to their wolves and so I know the truth. My dad told me to be careful who I shift around. He said that a lot of people out there might be intimated by Haven.I start up my car and head to the border of the river moon pack, dreading what I was about to do. It was not something many wolves did.""We can do it. We are strong enough to get through it."" Haven whispered in my mind.

As soon as I got across the border I spoke the words I never once in my life thought I would have to say.""I, Oakley Simpson, reject you, beta Derek Wright, as my mate."" A searing pain goes through me as I feel my end of the bond snapping.

I hear the agonizing howl of a wolf and felt bad for his wolf, Aries. I knew he was not at fault. I also did not know that Derek was in wolf form.""Do the rest."" Haven said.The next part I know will be painful, more so mentally then physical.""I, Oakley Simpson, reject the river moon pack as my pack."" I say with tears in my eyes. I hear the howls of many wolves who felt the bond of a pack member snapping from the pack.

The only way a member leaves the pack is to reject the pack or die and they had no idea which it was. Most pack members leaving are announced before it happens so everyone knows to expect it.""We need to go before they start looking."" Haven says sadly.

I know this is all just as painful for her as it was for me I hear my phone buzzing and look down to see Derek calling me. Hitting the ignore button I put my phone on the passenger seat and head off towards my destination. Everything is painful now but I will get through it and move on to a better, brighter future.",1,1753358273.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

(Could This Be BPD?),"I was in a relationship with a girl who constantly canceled plans last minute, told me I didn‚Äôt love her, and insisted I‚Äôd get tired of her soon. She‚Äôd push me away, tell me to find someone else, and then complain that I didn‚Äôt come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was ‚Äútoo messy.‚Äù

Any time I opened up emotionally, she‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll just leave.‚Äù

She often played jealousy games telling me people were asking if she was single  then blocked me on WhatsApp and texted that she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her after we broke up.

Later, my ex invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday and said she missed me more than she expected. Then asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I ‚Äúchose this,‚Äù that I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She never let me take pictures of us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. When I got emotionally vulnerable, she‚Äôd vanish. Once she even suggested I should try dating apps  and after the breakup, I found her using them.

One time, she said she wouldn‚Äôt go to a party, so I went to church. Out of nowhere, she changed her mind and insisted I go to church anyway. I offered to meet her earlier to spend time before the party she refused. I still brought her chocolate and waited outside. Her sister brought me in, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Later that night, she casually said, ‚ÄúShould we download an app and find you a hot girl?‚Äù

After I was robbed and nearly lost contact with her, she didn‚Äôt check in  just said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt text you unless you text me first.‚Äù

Eventually we did go to the movies after a long back and forth. She said we should ‚Äújust be friends,‚Äù but we held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn‚Äôt want me close to her family. When I said we never went out because she always flaked, she got mad. One time she gave me chocolate and cuddled ‚Äî minutes later, she brought up breaking up again.

So many hot and cold moments like this. Constant confusion and mixed signals.

Eventually I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and later said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic.‚Äù Then messaged saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. She said she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I told her I loved her, and she said she had gone somewhere and wished I‚Äôd gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday. I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom called me again asking if I loved her. Then invited me for coffee.
We started talking again. She told me her dad was angry at me, which triggered me emotionally. I vented online. She saw it, told me I used her, said she was insecure, that she prayed for me every day  then blocked me and disappeared.

To this day, I still don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

Could this be BPD behavior  or am I just making excuses for her?
Was I really the one who ruined her happiness?

**check-in experience**\- the checkin experience at the IGI airport for PE was super fast. it didnt even take one minute, since there was not a single person in the line. no difference for the immigration or security. boarding was quick and efficient, and the less crowding of lines is really nice. 

on my way back, at the DPS airport, the baggage drop at economy check-in didnt take long, but thats not a valid arguement, because more often than not, i have seen people lining up in the baggage drop line at the IGI airport without having done their web check-in or whatever. 

**seat experience**\-  im sorry to say this but the PE seat was just a normal seat in a different colour. it was not wider (obviously, since its a 3-3 configuration so there wouldnt be any space left for expansion), the legroom was just a slight improvement, and since i was at the very front (bad desicion), there was a partition between the PE and business class, so i couldnt stretch my legs. the TV was off centre, but i feel the recline was a bit better.  

comparing that with the enormous legroom in the emergency exit seat, i couldnt even touch the seat in front of me even with stretching my legs completely. the recline was normal, but the tv came out of the side, which was strange, but it worked. somehow it felt better than the off centre tv screens of the PE. 

**food and service-** PE takes this one. i had both the chicken meals available on the menu (yes there was a menu), and both of them were amazing. the drink selection was quite limited, but i suppose i dont mind that (i wanted a gin and tonic, but settled for a vodka coke). 

the food on the return journey was NOT good. i had the chicken meal which was a chicken curry and rice, though tasty, but the quantity was so shit. it was a 30-70 curry-rice split. 

**ammenities**\- PE gave me a face town (cold), the headphones were much nicer (they were proper headphones, and quite comfortable)

**extras-** every time i asked for water, i had to wait an avergage of 20 minutes in both PE and economy. this was really disappointing. the movie selection on the flight was excellent.  

  
**worth it?-** short answer- no. it was an 8 hour flight, and i felt much more comfortable in the emergency exit. i was travelling alone, which may or may not be a factor. i will be travelling on PE again in a few months (\~4 hours), with my family, and the lesser legroom with better ammenties might end up being a much nicer experience, but the 3k emergency exit with its legroom bordering that of a lie flat business class, outperforms a 9.5k PE in terms of comfort, leading to a better overall experience.

What is it?,"The White House has recently made a significant announcement regarding cryptocurrency policy, stating that President Trump supports a de minimis tax exemption for small Bitcoin and other crypto transactions. This policy aims to simplify the use of digital currencies for everyday transactions by potentially exempting transactions under $600 from capital gains tax. The announcement was made during a press briefing by White House secretory Karoline Leavitt.

why this matter: The current tax situation is completely broken for actual crypto payments. Nobody wants to track and report every tiny purchase, and the IRS doesn't have the resources to chase down coffee transactions anyway. This creates a weird situation where crypto payments are legal but practically unusable for normal stuff. Small swaps and transactions under $600 become much simpler to handle and businesses won't worry about customers creating tax headaches

the potential issues are that people might break down large purchases into small 600$ multiple transactions. And you still need to track down taxes on transactions above 600$, so the complexity would still remain.

This could be the difference between crypto staying a speculative investment versus becoming actual digital cash. Right now, using crypto for payments is a tax compliance nightmare that most people avoid. Remove that friction and suddenly crypto payments make sense. 

It feels like a sensible crypto tax policy proposal. A de minimis exemption acknowledges that some crypto transactions are just... transactions, not investment activity.

Anyone else think this could finally make crypto payments viable for normal stuff? Or are there downsides I'm missing?",2,1753357885.0,CryptoMarkets,2,1.0,False

In the fourth year of her marriage to Atticus Peterson, Wynter Montgomery discovered she was pregnant.

She went to the hospital to register for prenatal care, but when the nurse checked her documents, she was told her marriage certificate was invalid.

Wynter froze. ""That's impossible.""

The nurse pointed at the seal. ""This stamp is irregular, and the registration number doesn‚Äôt match our records.""

Refusing to believe it, Wynter rushed to the county clerk‚Äôs office‚Äîonly to hear the same verdict.

""Mr. Peterson is already married. His legal spouse is listed as Luciana Montgomery...""

Luciana?

The name hit Wynter like a thunderbolt, leaving her mind reeling.

Luciana‚Äîher half-sister, and Atticus‚Äôs first love.

Years ago, Luciana had left Atticus at the altar, fleeing abroad to chase her dreams.

Yet now, she was legally his wife?

......

Wynter stumbled out of the office like a ghost, her vision swimming, her steps unsteady.

Only when she collapsed into the backseat of a waiting cab did the tears she‚Äôd been holding back finally spill over in silence.

Four years ago, she had married Atticus in Luciana‚Äôs place to spare both families the scandal.

At first, Atticus had been distant, cold.

But Wynter never complained. She cared for his every need with unwavering devotion.

Gradually, day by day, he began to let his guard down.

He allowed her to disrupt his rigid routines.

Listened to her silly jokes with a patient smile.

Even trusted her with confidential work files.

Eventually, Atticus softened toward her.

He gave her a black card with unlimited spending, took her to every Michelin-starred restaurant in the city.

Once, when she craved peanut brittle from a bakery across town in the dead of night, he drove there himself, returning with an exasperated chuckle. ""You‚Äôre impossible,"" he teased, pinching her cheek. ""My little glutton.""

Wynter had thought she‚Äôd finally won his heart.

Then, two months ago, Luciana returned‚Äîterminally ill with cancer.

That same night, her father, Raymond Montgomery, called a family meeting.

His voice was grave as he addressed Wynter. ""Your sister has six months left at most. Her greatest regret is never marrying Atticus. So, you‚Äôll step aside‚Äîtemporarily. Once the wedding is over, and after she‚Äôs gone, Atticus will still be yours.""

Her stepmother, Carmen, pleaded through tears. ""She‚Äôs your sister. Just bear with it this once!""

Luciana sobbed hysterically. ""It‚Äôs my dying wish. Please, let me have this.""

Wynter couldn‚Äôt believe what she was hearing.

Her eyes burned as she choked out her reply. ""You forced me into this marriage like a puppet. Now you want to hand Atticus to her? What am I to you? I refuse!""

Her father ignored her protests, locking her in her room until she ""came to her senses.""

On the third day, she heard Atticus had smashed a coffee cup in front of Raymond in fury.

By the thirteenth, headlines blared Atticus‚Äôs public declaration: ""There is only one Mrs. Peterson‚ÄîWynter Montgomery.""

On the twenty-eighth, Atticus froze all business dealings with the Montgomery family, demanding they return his wife.

A full month passed before her locked door finally opened.

Chapter 2 - A Heart Shattered by Lies
But in the next second, she heard his hoarse voice say, ""Wynter, I'm sorry.""

""Your parents were insistent‚Äîthey even got down on their knees to beg me. For the sake of our families' long-standing friendship, I had to go along with your sister's act.""

""But trust me, it's just for show. You'll always be my only wife.""

At that moment, Wynter felt her heart plunge into darkness, every breath laced with searing pain.

After a stunned pause, she gently touched Atticus's hollow cheek, swallowing her tears. ""You did what you had to do.""

Later, she watched helplessly as Atticus slid a diamond ring onto Luciana's finger in front of a crowd, giving her a lavish wedding.

Later, he still treated her with the same attention as before.

Except the time he spent with Luciana grew longer‚Äîfrom occasional visits to nights stretching into days.

When Wynter confronted him, he calmly explained, ""I don‚Äôt love her. I just want to be there for her during her final days.""

Wynter believed him.

Until the truth hit her like a slap.

......

By the time the car stopped outside Peterson Corporation, Wynter had steadied herself.

She clutched the fake marriage certificate tightly in her hand.

Upon reaching the top floor, she ran into Atticus's secretary.

The secretary's expression tightened at the sight of her.

""Mrs. Peterson, what brings you here?""

""I need to see Atticus.""

""He's in a meeting right now. He can't‚Äî""

Ignoring the secretary, Wynter marched to his office door.

Just as she was about to push it open, Luciana's voice drifted out.

""Atticus, look me in the eyes and tell me the truth."" Luciana tugged at his tie with one hand, pressing the other over his heart. ""Has this ever really let me go?""

Atticus's throat moved, his breath hitching at her touch, yet his voice was cold. ""You're delusional.""

""Am I?"" Luciana laughed softly. ""You only married Wynter to force me to come back, didn‚Äôt you? The moment I returned, you made it official with me.""

""And then there‚Äôs your diary.""

""You said you let Wynter take my place to make me regret leaving‚Äîmmph!""

Before she could finish, Atticus grabbed the back of her neck.

All words were swallowed by a kiss that was almost brutal.

His eyes burned as he growled through clenched teeth, ""Yes. I never let you go. So, Luciana, how are you going to make it up to me?""

Wynter stood frozen outside, her body numb as if submerged in ice.

She remembered how Atticus had held her just days ago, kissing her hair as he whispered, ""Wynter, your sister is in the past. You're the only one I love now.""

How pathetic.

His so-called devotion had been nothing but lies.

Their marriage had been a farce from the start.

Wynter closed her eyes, forcing back tears.

If this was Atticus's choice, then she would let him go‚Äîlet him be with the woman he truly loved.

Dazed, Wynter stumbled into the elevator.

By the time she regained her senses, it had stopped at the basement level.

A cheerful intern approached her. ""Are you here for Luciana Montgomery's art exhibit? This way.""

Only then did Wynter realize she hadn‚Äôt pressed a floor.

Mechanically, she followed the intern into the gallery.

Chapter 3 - The Scar That Tore Her Heart
Wynter's gaze lingered on one of the oil paintings.

The canvas depicted a man's bare back, muscles sharply defined, with a distinctive scar near the lower back‚Äîunmistakable to her.

She had traced that scar's outline countless times in the dark. She knew exactly whose back this was.

Luciana had painted numerous portraits of Atticus, each signed with dates that seared Wynter's vision.

June 20th‚ÄîAtticus stood in the kitchen, bathed in golden light, stirring a pot.

Her third day of confinement. She'd been starving herself in protest, stomach cramping until she blacked out, while he cooked soup for Luciana.

July 1st‚ÄîElegant hands folded a silk nightgown embroidered with irises, his wedding band glinting coldly.

Day thirteen. She'd slit her wrists in defiance, blood soaking half the bedsheet, while he meticulously arranged Luciana's wardrobe.

July 15th‚ÄîHe walked beneath a canopy of trees, umbrella in hand, the painting's edge hinting at interlaced fingers.

Day twenty-eight. Her father had chained her to the bed, forcing surrender, while she writhed in feverish sheets. Meanwhile, he strolled through morning light, hand-in-hand with Luciana.

Each painting drove a needle deeper into Wynter's heart.

That entire month of darkness‚Äîhe hadn't been fighting for her at all. He'd been with Luciana the whole time.

His grand gestures‚Äîshattering china before her father, public declarations, cutting ties with the Montgomerys‚Äîall smoke and mirrors.

Wynter's nails bit into her palms, yet she felt nothing.

She turned away abruptly, exiting the exhibition.

---

Wynter scheduled an abortion for the following week, then visited the family estate to collect her late mother's belongings.

Her father met her with a plane ticket.

""Carmen and I agreed. Luciana should spend her remaining time with Atticus.""

""Leave in ten days. Consider it a vacation.""

Wynter studied the ticket, lips pressed thin.

The message was clear: they wanted her gone so Atticus and Luciana could play house undisturbed.

""Wynter, don't misunderstand‚Äî"" Carmen's eyes were red-rimmed, her worn-out excuses grating.

""I'll go.""

She was done with Atticus.

Done with this family.

Her father blinked at her compliance, mistaking it for defeat. His voice softened.

""Luciana's farewell gathering is in three days. Be there.""

""Fine.""

---

Home again, Wynter hauled out a cardboard box, purging every remnant of Atticus.

The birthday mugs.

Their first movie tickets.

The ridiculous photo booth strips she'd begged him to take.

The front door clicked open as she sealed the box.

Atticus froze at the sight, his chest constricting. He strode forward.

Chapter 4 - A Heart No Longer Begging
Wynter kept her head bowed, her gaze fixed on the floor.""Luciana‚Äôs moving in soon, right? I‚Äôm just clearing my things so she won‚Äôt be bothered by them.""Atticus seized her wrist, pulling her roughly against him.

I've been deep in the crypto world for a while, and I remember how incredibly overwhelming it was at the start. So, I spent the last few months creating a comprehensive guide to help new investors get started the right way. My goal was to put everything a beginner *actually* needs to know into one place, so you don't have to spend weeks piecing it all together like I did.

This isn't just a basic overview. It's a full guide that walks you through crucial topics like:

* Setting up your first wallet: I explain the real difference between hot and cold storage and even compare popular hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor so you can make an informed choice to keep your assets secure1.
* Your first purchase: A step-by-step walkthrough on how to buy crypto on an exchange without getting hit by surprise fees1.
* Real investment strategies: I break down practical, long-term strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and how to approach the ""buy the dip"" mindset without getting burned1.
* Crypto for retirement: A deep dive into Crypto IRAs, explaining the tax advantages and how you can potentially use digital assets to build long term wealth1.
* Risk management: Learn how to set stop loss and take profit orders to protect your capital and trade with a plan, not just emotion1.

I've put a ton of value and research into this, covering the security, strategy, and even the tax implications that trip up most beginners.

I want to make this accessible to as many people as possible, so I'm offering it for just **$4.99**. Honestly, I think it's a steal for the amount of time and potential mistakes it could save you.

If you're interested, you can grab it here: [https://ko-fi.com/s/6a8968acd0](https://ko-fi.com/s/6a8968acd0)

We have a 1 yr old daughter and are due any day with our son. On top of this, my husband just started a brand new job after being at the same retail store for over 5 yrs. He loves this new job and plans to retire from it. I‚Äôm so happy for him. This new job has obviously meant a change in our routines which is fine by me, the routines themselves actually haven‚Äôt been bad for me. We wake up earlier but that just gives me time to get things ready before our toddler wakes up. I pack my husband‚Äôs lunch the night before and pre-set the coffee pot to start in the morning. I‚Äôve also premade breakfast sandwiches so each morning I microwave a sandwich for him, pour his 2coffees (1 in a mug for while he‚Äôs getting ready and 1 in a travel mug for his drive), and set his travel mug and lunch near the front door. Then after I get off of work, I pick up our daughter, come home and cook dinner. I also put away the leftovers and clean the kitchen afterwards. These are mostly things I did before the new job but the difference was that he usually got home the same time or after me so it was a big more chaotic and he would still be stressed from his day. Now he gets home and has 15 minutes or so (depending on traffic) to relax before I get home with our daughter. The reason I‚Äôm feeling unappreciated is a collection of small things he says (or rather doesn‚Äôt say). He was playing Xbox when I finished dinner last night so I set his food next to him on the couch while I fed our toddler. He didn‚Äôt touch it until after she went down for bed and by then it was cold and no longer tasted as good. As the only one of us that typically gets the chance to eat the food hot, that gets under my skin. He didn‚Äôt eat dinner at all besides one bite. Then this morning I couldn‚Äôt find his travel mug and had to run out to the car to get it. Obviously it needed to be washed out since it sat out there and he told me I was making him wait instead of going to get the mug sooner. I feel it‚Äôs at the least his responsibility to bring in his mug so I can clean and refill it each day. Then not even a thank you, I love you or anything and he just left for work. As soon as the door closed, I broke down. These aren‚Äôt the only occurrences like this, just what‚Äôs currently fresh and bothering me. It‚Äôs also only been our routine for 4 days and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that. Is this going to stick and become our routine for the rest of his career? Or is it being new a reason to relax because we are both getting adjusted? Please take everything I said with the knowledge that I only have my own perspective to share. My husband does other things for me, he just remodeled our bedroom a couple weeks ago and has more home projects planned. I don't want to portray him as lazy, I just don‚Äôt know how to feel about this situation. Thank you!",8,1753357406.0,relationship_advice,11,1.0,False

and another question,, is it normal too to hear the same noise from what we hear when tv channels have no network signal (?? lol) as a default background noise?? apparently other ppl around me can hear it too when theyre close to me when im wearing hearing aids.

‚ÄúNails‚Äù has one of the longest and most insanely stupid rap sheets in the game. And on a personal note, I had a friend in college who interned for him. This is sometime around 2007. And I have it from a direct source that the man is insane. 

His first run-in with legal trouble started on the way home from John Kruk‚Äôs bachelor party, when he drove himself and passenger Darren Daulton into a tree and had his BAC measured at 0.179. 

And oh boy he was just getting started. There are several allegations of sexual harassment, steroid use, paying an escort with a bad check, and betting on baseball, all of which I believe. But let‚Äôs focus on the problems that have been validated in a court of law. 

He filed for bankruptcy in 2009, with two multi-million dollar properties placed in foreclosure. He was accused of vandalizing them on the way out. In 2010, in relation to bankruptcy proceedings, he was found to have hidden and sold assets, and repeatedly acted in a ‚Äúfraudulent and deceitful manner,‚Äù later being accused by federal prosecutors of having hidden or sold $400k worth of assets. One day after appearing in court on bankruptcy related issues in April 2011, he tried to buy a stolen car and was arrested on grand theft auto charges. The bankruptcy fraud got him house arrest. 

While on house arrest in June 2011, he was arrested for grand theft auto, identity theft, false financial statements, and possession of cocaine, ecstasy, and HGH. The drug charges were dropped in a plea deal. This got him 3 years in jail when finally sentenced in May 2012. 

In the interim, after some solemn reflection he turned his life around and never had problems with the law again‚Ä¶

Just kidding. 3 months later he was charged with indecent exposure for hiring maids in Craig‚Äôs list and whipping it out when they came to his house. That got him 9 months in jail. 

July 2012, more bankruptcy stuff got him 6.5 months in jail, 500 hours community service, and $200k restitution. 

He only spent 6.5 months in jail and was released in June 2013. 

In the 12 years since, he‚Äôs been much better behaved. He was only arrested once, in May 2018, for drug possession and uttering terroristic threats when he held a gun to an uber driver‚Äôs head for refusing to change destinations‚Ä¶ and they say a leopard never changes his spots.

An Unexpected Winter Adventure,"Last winter, after one of the biggest storms my town had seen in years, I woke up to a world transformed. My driveway was completely covered by a thick, solid sheet of ice‚Äîno amount of shoveling would break through it. I remember staring at it, coffee in hand, wondering how to tackle this frozen monster. Usually, I‚Äôd rely on good old-fashioned ice picks or wait for the sun to soften things‚Äîbut this time, I was tempted by a rebellious thought: ‚ÄúWhat if I used my mini chainsaw?‚Äù

The Spark of Curiosity
My mini chainsaw was bought months earlier, mainly for pruning the wild fruit trees on my property. It was light, powerful for its size, and frankly, a lot of fun to use. But I‚Äôd never imagined using it on ice. Still, the stubborn sheet on my driveway felt like a challenge demanding innovation. I figured, why not? After all, the chainsaw‚Äôs spinning chain cuts through wood fast enough; surely ice wouldn‚Äôt be much harder?

Gearing Up for Battle
Before diving in, I suited up like I was preparing for a small expedition: goggles to protect my eyes from flying ice shards, thick gloves to keep my hands warm and safe, and boots with solid grip. I also cleared off the fresh snow layering the ice, so the saw wouldn‚Äôt immediately get bogged down.

I remember how cold the air felt with each breath, and how the sun‚Äôs weak rays bounced off the sparkling ice. The chainsaw roared to life‚Äîa sharp contrast to the quiet winter morning‚Äîand with a bit of nervous excitement, I made the first cut.

The Moment of Truth
The chainsaw bit into the ice smoothly, surprisingly smooth‚Äîalmost like slicing through butter. Ice chips exploded outwards in every direction, glittering in the sunlight like tiny diamonds. I had to pause frequently, wiping the bar and chain clean to prevent clogging.

What fascinated me was how fast the cuts were compared to the slow grind of a manual saw. But I also noticed the chain dulled quickly; it probably wasn‚Äôt designed for frozen water. The cool air and ice fragments created a frosty mist around the saw, and I thought about how delicate, yet powerful, the tool was.

Lessons Learned from the Ice
Safety Is Never Optional: One gust sent shards flying almost at eye level. It reinforced the importance of goggles‚Äîeven when it feels safe.

Sharpen Often: Ice dulls the chain faster than wood, so expect to sharpen mid-task.

Gas Over Electric: My gas mini chainsaw handled the cold dampness better than I imagine an electric one would.

Work Small: Trying to conquer thick ice in one go quickly overheats the saw and risks blade pinching.

Cleanup is Key: Ice droplets everywhere mean slippery spots and potential hazards.

A New Winter Tool in My Arsenal
By the end of the morning, my driveway was clear. What started as a simple experiment turned into a satisfying win against nature‚Äôs frozen obstacle. I even carved a few ice blocks for my cooler‚Äîa practical bonus!

This mini chainsaw didn't just cut through ice; it cut through my doubts about unconventional solutions. It‚Äôs now part of my winter toolkit, a reminder that sometimes it pays to think differently‚Äîand suit up for the adventure.",0,1753356908.0,Tools,2,0.33,False

Sharing real patterns I discovered and happy to show the tool I made if anyone's interested.

Hey fellow introverts,

For years, I could never predict which social plans would leave me feeling drained for days and which left me recharged. After a team lunch wiped me out for half a week, I started tracking my social energy like a science experiment.

I learned a few surprising things‚Äîlike how the \*type\* of interaction (not just the people) changes how fast my social battery drains. Coffee chats with one person? I bounce back in 6 hours. Group meetings with the same people? Need 2-3 days to recover.

Eventually, I put together a simple tool to help me spot these patterns and plan recovery upfront. It's still in beta, but it's made a real difference for me.

Has anyone else tried tracking their social energy? What patterns have you noticed? I'd love to trade ideas/tips. If you're curious to see my approach, the tool's at introenergy.app ‚Äîno pressure, just happy to swap feedback with fellow introverts.

When I saw my stepsister's text message, I was completely confused.

Until the next message that came through from Amber was a picture of my boyfriend, Derek, and her in bed together.

They were undressed, and Derek was behind Amber, leaning over her, while she was on all fours. It was very obvious from the picture of what they were doing.

\[What is this?\] I had no idea how to respond to this. I felt like my heart was in my throat, and I was doing everything I could to fight back the tears.

He told me that he was working. But what‚Äôs this?

I can‚Äôt help thinking how many of those times he slept with her and then came home and slept with me.

I feel so gross. I heard his car pull into the drive.

A wild plan came to my mind.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

OAKLEY

I sit in the darkness of the livingroom of the home I share with my mate, the beta of the moon river pack, Derek Wright. It's late.

Probably after midnight. I can't bring myself away from the window to check the time as I watch for his homecoming. I am praying to the moon goddess that nothing bad has happened to him and that his phone just died.

Hoping he just got caught up in his work and that's why he didn't contact me to let me know he would be late.I pull myself out of my thoughts of horrible things happening and decide to get changed for bed. I put on my comfy, soft pink pajama pants and a plain black night shirt. I pull my long blonde hair into a bun and brush my teeth.

Once I have completed all my nightly, before bed routine, I find myself back in the darkness of the livingroom. I sit in the window seat and stare out the window.Haven, my wolf, has been pacing in my head, a feeling of unease coming from her. I don't dare to ask her what is wrong because I fear her answer. I also cannot ask her to stop pacing, despite the headache it's beginning to give me, because I understand why she is pacing.I try reaching out to Derek through the mind link for what feels like the hundredth time only to be met with silence.

If we were marked and mated then I would be able to feel him, feel his emotions. I would know if something was wrong. But Derek insisted we wait. He won't tell me why or when but just that he is waiting for the right time.

Everyone knows that we are fated mates. It's not a secret. As soon as we discovered we were mates he insisted I move in with him. I attended beta training with his mother. She treated me like I was a daughter and also said I was excelling at beta training.I was so lost in thought that I nearly jumped out of my skin when my phone dinged, signaling a text message. I pick it up to see a message from my half sister, Amber.

When I was little my mother was killed in a rogue attack protecting the alphas wife. My dad was devistated. For a few years it was just us but he decided to take a chosen mate, Bailey. For a few years everything was good. She was kind to me and treated me like a daughter. Until she had Amber. After that, whenever my dad was not around they would treat me like I was their slave. Bailey would tell me that I could not say anything to my father because I would destroy his happiness and it would make me selfish. I didn't want to see my dad upset again.

I remember what it was like when my mom died and how he could barely function at first.I'm a little surprised that she is texting me since we barely speak to each other. She is probably at a party and is drunk. Why else would she text me? Deciding I could use this as a temporary distraction I open up the message.Amber: hello big sister.Oakley: what do you want?Amber: is that any way to talk to your sister?Oakley: if you don't have an actual reason for texting me then goodbye.Amber: oh, but I have a reason.Amber: I just wanted to thank you.Oakley: for what?Amber: for sharing your mate with me.Oakley was confused.

Until the next message that came through from Amber was a picture of Derek and Amber in bed together. They were undressed and Derek was behind Amber, leaning over her, while she was on all fours. It was very obvious by the picture of what they were doing.

I wasn't even sure how she was able to get a picture like that without having someone else take it or setting up a camera.Oakley: what is this?I had no idea how to respond to this. I felt like my heart was in my throat and I was doing everything I could to fight back the tears. Haven was howling in agony in my head.Amber: oh don't be so surprised.

I am far better then you. In everything according to Derek. That is why he will be taking me as his chosen mate and rejecting you.I didn't even bother responding. I knew she was just trying to get under my skin. And it was working too. I felt awful. My mate, my fated mate, was cheating on me with my own sister. And now I understood why he wasnt marking me yet.

Because I would feel every indiscretion. Every time he cheated I would know. But as long as we were not marked I would have no idea. All these times I thought he was just working late. I wondered how many of those times he slept with her and then came home and slept with me. That made me feel so gross and angry. I knew I couldn't stay here any longer.I heard his car pull into the drive. I hurried to the bedroom and got into bed.

There was no way I was going to confront him right now. I needed a plan. I needed some time to think.I could hear Derek come into the house. I hoped he wouldn't come to me because I am not sure how long I could pretend to be asleep and keep it together. It was taking everything I had to not cry and give myself away. I didn't want to hear his excuses.

Haven is sulking in my mind. Going back and fourth between wanting to claw his eyes out to painfully howling.I can hear his heavy footsteps as he gets closer to the bedroom, the floor creaking under his weight.

He comes into the room and pauses for a moment. I don't move, I won't risk him coming to me. After what feels like an eternity, which was probably only seconds, he makes his way into the bathroom. I can hear the shower come on and I breath a sigh of relief, releasing my breath that I don't even realize I was holding in. I was glad he went to shower because I could smell my sisters scent mixed in with his. He was careless this time it seems.

That or I was just to blind to notice. Maybe I was even in denial.

A few times I when I was paranoid and thought he was cheating I had expressed it to him and he always claimed he would never do that, that the fated bond was sacred.""Does he know that Amber sent that picture?"" I think to myself.

Then I am doubtful about it. I decide that I should probably try and get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a really long day. I have a lot to do.

I tossed and turned all night. Knowing that the past year of my life has been nothing but a lie. I wondered who else knew.

I waited for Derek to get up and leave for work. I did not want to even look at him. I knew I would start to cry. I was still not ready to have any conversations with him. As soon as I heard his car pull away I crawled out of bed.

I know the turmoil of emotions I was feeling would not help me to make any good decisions but I also knew that I could not stay here any longer.I headed to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee. Just the thought of eating anything made my stomach turn.

I leaned over the island in the kitchen while I waited for the coffee to be finished and spaced out. I was trying hard not to think about my current situation but thoughts of the past kept coming back to me.

Were there signs of his indiscretions? Was I naive?

I felt so stupid as I thought about all the little red flags that I just ignored. The aroma of coffee hit my nose, pulling me from my thoughts. With a sigh I retrieved my cup, add some creamer to it and then headed back to the bedroom to get dressed and pack up all of my belongings.

I had no idea what I was even going to say to anyone.I put on a pair of blue jeans and a pale pink, form fitting T-shirt.

One of the benefits of being a werewolf was that our bodies were always in shape. Even if we didn't work out we metabolized everything much faster. However, being the daughter of the head warrior of the pack, I was very much in shape.

I grew up learning to fight and keeping up with physical fitness.I went through the house, room by room, gathering all of my belongings and putting them on my bed so I could pack everything. I made sure to leave behind anything Derek had given me. I did not want any reminders of his fake affections. I pulled my duffle bag out of the closet and my suitcases out from underneath the bed. Once I had everything packed I put them by the front door.

My phone buzzed a few times while I was packing. I ignored it because I wanted to get things done quickly. I picked it up to see some missed text messages. One from my dad asking why I was not at training, one from Bailey saying she needed to speak with me, one from Amber saying her mother wanted to talk to me and one from Derek saying he might come home for lunch and that I should consider wearing something revealing.

That last text made my stomach churn and I resisted the urge to vomit. Slipping my phone into my pocket, I grab my bags and head out to my car. I do not want to be here when Derek¬†[arrives.As](http://arrives.as/)¬†I close the trunk after putting my bags in a car pulls up at the end of the driveway. It's Bailey and Amber.""Hello sister."" Amber says in a sickly sweet tone. I have to use all of my self control to not punch her in her stupid face.

All I can see is the picture she sent of my mate and her in bed together. But before I can open my mouth to say anything Bailey speaks.""We need to talk Oakley."" She says.""I don't have anything to say to either of you."" I respond, walking towards the driver side of my car.""Well you might not have anything to say but you will listen."" Bailey says as she steps between me and my car, blocking my path.""What do you want?"" I know that I will not get out of here until they say whatever it is they want.""There is no need to use that tone with me you ungrateful brat.

I am your fathers mate and you will treat me with respect."" Bailey snaps at¬†[me.It](http://me.it/)¬†takes everything in me to not roll my eyes at her. I just stand there waiting for her to continue. When she realizes I am not going to respond she continues on.""Amber will be with Derek now and you will accept his rejection when he rejects you.

You will also not tell anyone that he was cheating on you and that the rejection was your idea. You will not tarnish Derek and Ambers reputation. She is more suited to be a beta's mate then a nobody like you."" Bailey said.I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

There was no way it was going to happen like that. I also knew that there was no way I was going to be able to stay at my dads because they would make life a nightmare for me. I would be treated like a maid when my dad is not around.

I thought Derek was my savior but it turns out I was wrong. And there was no way I was going to impose on my best friend, Erica, when she had just found her mate, Billy, from a neighboring pack. I was super happy for her.I didn't respond and Bailey grabbed my face by the cheeks, squeezing just hard enough for it to hurt but to not leave marks.""Do you understand?"" She asked, looking me dead in the eye with a look of anger in her eyes.I knew that if I said no she would do something bad right then so I decided to just pretend to go along with it for now.

""Yes."" I gritted out between my teeth.

I decided right then that I was going to leave the pack. I would stop at the bank and take out all of my savings and be gone before anyone knew. I would call my dad when I got to my destination. I didn't want him to talk me out of what I was planning on doing. I knew it would hurt him, my leaving without saying anything to him, but I needed to get out of there.""Good."" Bailey spits out as she lets go. The both of them get into Baileys car and drive off. I sigh and get into my car. Haven was trying hard to get out and attack them but I held her back. One thing that a lot of people didn't know was that Haven was massive and strong. She was bigger then a normal wolf. She was more the size of an alpha wolf with pure white fur. I didn't shift in front of anyone. Amber and Bailey were always jealous of Haven so I wasn't allowed to shift in front of them. Though they claim that their wolves are scared of her size but Haven has spoken to their wolves and so I know the truth. My dad told me to be careful who I shift around. He said that a lot of people out there might be intimated by Haven.I start up my car and head to the border of the river moon pack, dreading what I was about to do. It was not something many wolves did.""We can do it. We are strong enough to get through it."" Haven whispered in my mind.

As soon as I got across the border I spoke the words I never once in my life thought I would have to say.""I, Oakley Simpson, reject you, beta Derek Wright, as my mate."" A searing pain goes through me as I feel my end of the bond snapping.

I hear the agonizing howl of a wolf and felt bad for his wolf, Aries. I knew he was not at fault. I also did not know that Derek was in wolf form.""Do the rest."" Haven said.The next part I know will be painful, more so mentally then physical.""I, Oakley Simpson, reject the river moon pack as my pack."" I say with tears in my eyes. I hear the howls of many wolves who felt the bond of a pack member snapping from the pack.

The only way a member leaves the pack is to reject the pack or die and they had no idea which it was. Most pack members leaving are announced before it happens so everyone knows to expect it.""We need to go before they start looking."" Haven says sadly.

I know this is all just as painful for her as it was for me I hear my phone buzzing and look down to see Derek calling me. Hitting the ignore button I put my phone on the passenger seat and head off towards my destination. Everything is painful now but I will get through it and move on to a better, brighter future.

Energy tanks.

Brain fog.

Suddenly, that to-do list is a cruel joke.

This is not just you.

Millions deal with the exact same thing.

You can blame lunch, bad sleep, or too much screen time.

But there is a deeper reason most people never hear about.

**Meet your stress hormones**

Cortisol is the ‚Äúget it done‚Äù hormone.

When you are under stress, your body releases more of it.

That is great for running from bears.

Not so great when your boss is just sending emails.

The problem?

Your cortisol and testosterone fight for the same resources.

More stress means higher cortisol.

Higher cortisol means less testosterone.

Your body literally turns stress into lower energy and less motivation.

**What cortisol steals from you**

* Morning drive fades faster
* Motivation and mood drop
* Gym recovery takes longer
* Sleep gets lighter and more restless
* Fat stores creep up in weird places
* Brain fog becomes the default

Most guys do not realize it is not just ‚Äúgetting older‚Äù or ‚Äúworking too hard.‚Äù

It is the hormone war that happens every time you grind through a stressful week.

**Why this battle is so brutal in 2025**

Chronic stress is everywhere.

Pandemic aftermath.

Work from home.

The ‚Äúalways on‚Äù phone life.

More stress means cortisol levels stay high, day after day.

Over time, that makes your body put testosterone on the back burner.

No wonder energy, mood, and drive are in freefall for so many guys.

**How to fight back (without jumping straight to meds)**

* Prioritize real sleep (not just scrolling in bed)
* Lift weights, move more, but do not overtrain
* Get morning sunlight. Your hormones love it
* Try actual breathing or mindfulness, even if it sounds corny
* Watch caffeine timing. Afternoon coffee can spike cortisol
* Natural adaptogens like ashwagandha have real research for lowering cortisol
* Check your vitamin D and magnesium, both matter for hormone balance

No magic bullet, but small habits stack up fast.

**When to get serious**

If the crash gets worse.

If sleep, mood, or gym progress stall out for months.

If stress feels unmanageable.

See a doctor. Get bloodwork.

You might need more than lifestyle changes.

But most guys can win a huge part of this battle just by lowering stress and supporting their hormones naturally.

Today, I had the chance to meet Mr. Hussein Al-Sharaa (who introduced himself as Abu Maher), the father of President Ahmad Al-Sharaa, in the Mezzeh neighborhood. We shared a brief but engaging conversation over a cup of coffee. I was immediately struck by his gracious demeanor, humility, and broad intellect. He spoke with clarity, balance, and a deep understanding of the issues at hand, thoughtful and objective in every word.

Mr. Al-Sharaa Sr. is clearly a seasoned economist. He offered critiques of the ‚ÄúJawhara‚Äù and ‚ÄúQasioun‚Äù projects, voicing concerns about the monopolization of investment. He expressed hope that national priorities would concentrate on dismantling displacement camps and ensuring the safe return of those who‚Äôve been uprooted. He also spoke passionately about revitalizing agriculture and livestock production, referencing studies he had personally conducted in the field.

Although we didn‚Äôt discuss the President directly, he made it clear how proud he was of the liberation. He emphasized the heavy price paid in lives and blood, and concluded with a firm stance: going back is not an option. There will be no surrender, he said, no matter the cost, because the freedom that came at the sacrifice of millions of lives is not something that can ever be given up.

1m81v8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m81v8p/the_night_i_died_my_husband_of_25_years_was/,"The night I died, my husband of 25 years was watching fireworks with our children","# The night I died, my husband of 25 years was watching fireworks with our children. I called for him. I called his phone, hoping he would come.

""I'm busy,"" he said. ""Stop your whining and just come join us!""

""Matthew,"" I breathed out, my voice barely above a whisper.

""Is that Mom complaining that we're leaving her out again?"" I heard my son say. ""God she's annoying.""

""Dad, just hang up. She's going to have her tantrum one way or the other. Why let it ruin the night?"" I heard my daughter snark.

The phone dropped from my hand as my consciousness wavered and then finally collapsed.

Hours passed, and my family didn't even notice that I had not only not arrived for the fireworks display but had also stopped calling or texting.

When the display ended and my family gathered their belongings, they noticed I wasn't in the crowd.

""She's still having a tantrum,"" my daughter, Anna, said, rolling her eyes. ""She's probably at home sulking.""

""She's just being petulant,"" my son, Alex, said. ""Because we didn't wait for her to come.""

""I'll deal with her when we get home,"" Matthew, my supposed loving husband, said as he closed the trunk of his car once he'd stowed the picnic blankets and food I had carefully and lovingly packed for our family outing to watch the annual fireworks display our city put on for Founder's Day.

The three of them drove home expecting me to be there waiting.

They were surprised when they got to our house and saw that none of the lights were on.

""Even if she goes to sleep before us, Mom always leaves a light on,"" Alex said, frowning in confusion.

""She's being childish,"" Anna said. ""She didn't get her way because we asked her to go grab something and she wasn't back when we were ready to go.""

And that was true.

Before we planned to leave, Anna and Alex asked for a specific drink we could only find at one store across town. They insisted they had to have the drink at the fireworks display, as it was their tradition. I had forgotten to buy the drink, so I had to go out and get it for them.

It's not like they are incapable of driving. They both have licences and they each have their own cars. But my supposedly loving husband, with whom I had raised our two children, giving up my position at a law firm in the city to stay home with, argued that I had neglected to get it in all my preparations for the evening's event. Therefore, I was responsible for rectifying it by going across town during rush hour to retrieve this precious drink.

And so, because I had devoted my life to the happiness of my husband and children, often to the sacrifice of my own happiness and comfort, I got into my car and headed out, asking only that they wait for my return before leaving for the fireworks.

I never made it to the store.

On the way, a terrible accident was on the highway ahead of me. I maneuvered around it but was blindsided by a truck that had decided to speed around the accident site and had hit my car, forcing it off the road and down an embankment. I lost consciousness as my car rolled to the bottom of the embankment and landed against a tree.

By the time I came around, the sun had set. My vision was blurry, and my left leg felt like it was on fire. The car's roof had collapsed somewhat, and the car had come to rest against the tree, and I was still strapped into my seat. I heard nothing around me but the sound of traffic on the highway above. I didn't even see any flashing lights of any emergency vehicles. Was it possible that not one driver had noticed my car get hit by that truck? Had the truck driver not reported that he'd hit a car and thrown it down the embankment?

With much difficulty and much pain, I very carefully undid my seatbelt, using my left leg to brace myself against the middle console. I pulled at the cracked sunroof and dragged my broken and bruised body through it, managing a couple of nice, deep gashes courtesy of the shattered glass.

Thankfully, my phone had been in my pocket while I was driving, so I tried to retrieve it once I got away from the car and lay on my back in the dirt disturbed by the rolling car.

Above my head, I could see that the fireworks display had begun. I didn't know how much time had passed and how much of the display was left. I pressed Matthew's contact on my phone.

""What do you want?"" was how he answered when he picked up. ""We waited until we couldn't wait any longer. Where are you? It's ten minutes back and forth and you never bothered to show up. You didn't even come here to meet us. You know this display is important to the twins and I and you couldn't even manage to get everything prepared correctly.""

I was trying to stay conscious as he berated me for something that was out of my control.

""You've disappointed the twins by conveniently forgetting their favourite drink, and then by being petulant and immature and not even bothering to come home in time to leave with us. Now the display is almost over and you still haven't shown up,"" he continued.

""Where is she?"" I heard Anna ask.

""Who cares anymore?"" Alex said. ""Just tell her we're busy and to meet us here or whatever. She's probably mad we didn't wait for her.""

""I'm busy,"" Matthew said. ""Stop your whining and just come join us.""

""Matthew,"" I breathed out, my voice barely above a whisper. I was trying to get him to hear me. I was trying to get him to hear that my life was ebbing out of me. I didn't know it, but one of the cuts on my legs had sliced a small cut into a femoral vein and nicked the artery. I was bleeding out but all I felt was cold and tired.

""Is that Mom complaining that we're leaving her out again?"" I heard my son say. ""God she's annoying.""

""Dad, just hang up. She's going to have her tantrum one way or the other. Why let it ruin the night?"" I heard my daughter snark.

My consciousness collapsed, and slowly, my life ebbed away. I died, alone, at the bottom of an embankment, unseen by the world above.

""I can't believe she's being so childish,"" Alex said as they walked into the dark house. ""I mean, fine. Don't show up to the fireworks. She made her point. But to make it look like we aren't even welcome in our own home? So stupid.""

""What do you expect?"" Anna said to her brother. ""She's immature and just playing one of her stupid games. I bet she's sitting in the living room, just stewing. And I'll also bet that no matter how upset she is, which is dumb, she's still got our bedtime snack ready and waiting.""

Every night before the kids went to bed, I made them a snack. Something light, but filling and healthy. Some fruit and cheese and a cup of warm milk, sometimes hot chocolate, just to send them to sleep with full bellies and warm thoughts. Tonight, however, I hadn't made their snack. I hadn't warmed milk for them. I hadn't come home because my now-dead body was at the bottom of the embankment.

Matthew turned on the foyer light as they entered the house.

""Amelia!"" he shouted. ""Stop this petty game! You couldn't even turn on a light? How childish are you? If I had known I had married a child I wouldn't have had to have children!""

The twins looked at their father.

""You know I don't mean I didn't want you to be born. I'm making a point that I don't need to raise another child when I've raised the two of you already,"" he explained. They smiled and nodded.

Alex and Anna were the apples of their father's eye. They could do no wrong. When they were young and would fight over a toy, Matthew's instinct was to blame me for not getting each their own toy, and then immediately would go to get the other twin an identical toy. This had ruined entirely the lesson I had been trying to teach them about learning to share with others. All they knew was that if they complained enough, their father would buy them what they wanted, while their mother was the mean one who kept all the fun away from them.

When Alex was close to failing his junior year of high school, Matthew blamed me for not tutoring him enough, or if I wasn't smart enough to help him, then I should hire a tutor who was. Intelligence wasn't my problem. I was quite capable of helping Alex with his homework. Whenever I tried to sit down with him, he would immediately stop listening, talk over me, and insist I didn't know what I was talking about. He refused to listen to me and my explanations of the concepts in his junior law course. He told me I was stupid and knew nothing about the laws.

He didn't notice that I had written the textbook his school used. It was under my maiden name, but that didn't change the fact that that text was mine and I knew those laws inside and out. And Matthew never corrected either of the twins when they told him I was stupid.

Matthew and I had met in college when I was a freshman and pre-law. He was in a business program and some of my pre-law classes overlapped with his business law classes, seeing as us pre-law students would likely wind up working for and with some of the business students as legal representation in their businesses.

Our courtship had been one you'd only read about in fairy tales. The whole 'swept me off my feet' type of love. The 'foot popping' first k1ss.

Matthew was handsome. Many of the girls in my class, and his, wanted to date him. I won't lie. I did too. But I knew I was just one of many who was interested in Matthew Davenport.

I didn't pursue him. I didn't throw myself at his feet (not intentionally, anyway). I would say hello to him if our paths crossed on campus, outside of class, or at parties we both attended. I watched from afar as my classmates, and his, vied for his attention. I would smile to myself as I watched some of the tricks and tactics other girls tried to get his attention with. My friends and I often laughed together at some of the antics we had watched our peers put themselves through.

Matthew was a bit of a mystery. Everyone knew he came from a wealthy family. Everyone knew he was expected to take over his family's business after he graduated. And Matthew was a serious student. He did, however, struggle with some of the law classes he had to take, and therefore my professor assigned me as his tutor. As the top student in the business law class, it only made sense.

""I don't get why I have to learn all this when I can just hire you when you become a lawyer and you can deal with all this stuff!"" He cried, exasperated, one night during a tutoring session where he was having trouble with two similar concepts with very different results.

""You need to know this because if you're the one running the business, you need to know if the issue will be a detriment or an asset if it becomes a legal issue. This is the type of stuff you don't want to come across in business. You need to be able to recognize the problem before you have to hire a lawyer.""

I explained the difference once again.

I tutored Matthew for the entire semester. In return, he often treated my roommates and I to dinner, replaced a couple of pieces of broken furniture and even bought us a new microwave when ours decided it no longer wanted to do its job.

We had never asked for any of it and even tried to decline the microwave.

""Honestly, it's the least I can do. I passed my law final thanks to you, and if I hadn't had you as a tutor, Amelia, I am one hundred percent convinced I would have flunked the whole class. So as a thank you, please accept the microwave,"" he'd said.

It was a top of the line model that was well outside our price range. But we did accept it, graciously, and invited him over for a movie night where he got to witness the first use of the appliance as we made popcorn.

Matthew was sweet, and kind. And while I admit I had a crush on him, I thought he was out of my league. I was happy enough to consider him a friend.

Fast forward three years, Matthew and I graduated. He completed his studies release Laude and I completed my pre-law undergraduate degree Magna release Laude. I had law schools vying for my application. Scholarship offers and bursaries were pouring in. My roommates and Matthew all helped me decide where to attend law school.

At the end of the year, before we all had to move out of our dorms or apartments, Matthew and his roommates threw a huge end of year bash off campus. Of course he invited my roommates and me.

""I can't not invite the woman who made business law less of a hellscape!"" He said as he handed me the flyer for the party. It was being held in a rather¬†exclusive¬†bar and rumor had it that Matthew had rented out the entire place just for the party. I couldn't say no. I wouldn't have ever been able to get into this bar otherwise.

The night of the party, my roommates and I helped each other get ready. We wanted to look our best though we all came from relatively humble backgrounds. My parents were divorced with my father off in some foreign country with his mistress and my mother making an honest living as a nurse in our local hospital. I had gotten into university on scholarships and had worked as a tutor for some extra cash. My mother still had my brother and sister to support, so I did my best to be as little of a financial burden as possible. Even still, she sent me some money occasionally, just to remind me that she was still in my corner. She told me all the time how proud she was of me, and I thanked her every time for the money she sent, usually trying to save it to either take her out to dinner when I graduated, or to use for something special for all four of us when I did.

Emma, Roberta, Callie, my roommates, and I shared a rideshare to the party. Even the driver was impressed when we pulled up.

""Nice place,"" he whistled. ""So I've heard. How'd you get so lucky to get an invite in here?""

""A friend,"" I said, sliding out of the car. We thanked the driver and headed to the door.

""Invite?"" The bouncer at the door asked.

""Invite? We were only given a flyer. And it didn't say anything about needing to bring it,"" I said to the large man at the door.

""The flyer was the invite. Everyone knows to bring the flyer. If you don't have it, I can't let you in. University class only.""

""We're from the university!"" We protested, pulling out our student ID cards.

""You could have had those made at any copy place,"" the bouncer said, unimpressed.

I blew out a breath in frustration.

""Danny, they're fine,"" a voice said. ""They're with me.""

I looked up and there was our knight in shining... Armani? Matthew Davenport in a well tailored suit looking every bit the import/export magnate he was destined to be.

""Apologies, Mr. Davenport,"" the bouncer said, stepping back. ""They didn't have their flyer.""

""No worries, good man,"" Matthew smiled. ""You were just doing your job. I appreciate that. We don't want anyone uninvited. But these four are definitely invited. Come on, ladies. Come in.""

Matthew grinned at us, the bouncer smiled and we thanked them both as we stepped into the bar.

The place was amazing. The interior looked like we had walked into a bar carved out of a glacier. Glass and lights created the illusion of ice and snow. Everything was bathed in blue light, and everything in the bar‚Äîall the tables, counters, chairs, sofas, and furniture‚Äîwas all white, creating the illusion of a bar literally frozen in ice. It was magnificent.

""It's an open bar, but be mindful, hmm?"" Matthew said over the music. I felt his hand lightly on my back. He leaned close to me.

""You clean up quite nicely,"" he whispered in my ear. I blushed. Throughout school I had dressed in comfortable, casual clothes, preferring loose sweats and jeans over suits, dress pants or skirts. I was there to learn, not for a fashion show.

""As do you, Mr. Davenport,"" I smiled. Matthew had dressed more casually in school, too. But usually in jeans or slacks, sneakers or loafers and t-shirts or button down shirts. Rarely in shorts or sweats unless he was playing football in the quad with his friends.

""Come to the bar. Let me get you a drink. I've got a signature cocktail,"" he said, guiding me towards the glass topped 'ice cube' in the middle of the large space.

Matthew indicated to the bartender that he wanted two of his cocktails and a minute later, a blue drink in a martini glass was in front of me.

""To graduation and what lies beyond,"" Matthew said, his smile making it all the way up to his eyes.

""To the future,"" I responded.

We clinked glasses and I took a sip of the blue drink.

It was sweet and delicious. It tasted of raspberries and lemon.

""This is good. What's it called?""

""The Amelia,"" he said, looking me straight in the eyes over the rim of his glass.

I stared at him. He'd named the drink after me?

Matthew led me to a couch in the corner, indicating to the bartender to send over two more in a couple of minutes. He sat me down and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders.

""You intrigue me,"" he said to me.

""How so?"" I asked.

""I know you have a crush on me, my buddy Tyler told me,"" he smiled at me. I felt my cheeks redden. Tyler was Emma's boyfriend, and no doubt she'd told him.

""But unlike every other girl in this school, you never put on an act. You never act like you're just here to get your MRS,"" he said. I frowned at him.

""MRS?"" I asked, unsure what degree that was.

""Mrs. Davenport. Some - a lot - of girls come to university looking for a husband, not a career. And a lot of the girls in our classes, well, you're not blind and you're not stupid. You've seen how girls act around me. I don't want to come across as narcissistic or selfish. I know I'm not ugly. I know I'm kinda good-looking. I'm lucky in that way, I guess. But the way girls around here throw themselves at people like me. They want my money. My family's money, our status, the things that people in my position are not entitled to, exactly. That sounds gross, but the perks, I guess, of having money.

""I'm not naive, Amelia. I know that in terms of birth, I won a lottery somehow. My parents have done well for themselves, and my grandparents have done well for themselves. I know I'm extremely lucky. I know I grew up in lucky cirreleasestances.""

""What does any of that have to do with me?"" I asked.

""You don't seem to care one way or the other whether I even look in your direction. And yet, when you were asked to tutor me, you didn't say no,"" he said.

""Why would I? A fellow student needed help, and I was able to help. So I did,"" I said.

""And yet, in all that time together, you never once made a move. You stuck to the topics at hand and got me through my exams, and not once did you even hint at, well, anything,"" he said.

""I'm not sure if you're trying to compliment me or not,"" I frowned.

My drink was empty, and the bartender had come by with our refills. I took a sip of my second drink.

""Compliment. Entirely. I promise,"" Matthew said, watching me over his own glass. I looked back at him, not letting him try to intimidate me.

""So, after graduation, I assume you're going to law school,"" Matthew said, changing the subject.

""Of course,"" I said. What was the point of being pre-law if I wasn't going actually to go ahead and get a law degree?

""Have you chosen which school yet?"" he asked, interested.

""I'm deciding between two. I have another two weeks before I have to put in my final decision,"" I said.

""What's the criteria you're trying to decide on?"" he asked.

""Distance, how much scholarship they're offering and whether they have the law program I want,"" I replied.

""Why is distance a factor?"" Matthew asked.

""I don't want to be too far from home,"" I replied. ""My mom is a single mom and she still has my younger brother and sister at home. I want to be able to go back home and visit, help her out a little bit, and be available if needed.""

""Ah. What about your dad? How old are your brother and sister?"" Matthew asked.

""My dad left us when I was sixteen. He's off in some other country with his wh0re,"" I said, and then slapped my hand over my mouth. Matthew laughed heartily.

""I love an honest woman,"" he said, joy in his eyes. ""So, how old are your siblings?""

""Kieran is fourteen and Alecia is twelve,"" I said.

""Fun. My brother is twenty, just started university and, according to my father, not doing much. He's basically the spare. My dad planned on handing the business to me, and I've been groomed my whole life to take it over. My brother is a bit more of a free spirit and doesn't really have any direction. Which is too bad, because he's really smart,"" Matthew said.

I had no response to that. My brother and sister were also pretty smart, but with Kieran just starting high school and Alecia finishing middle school, I didn't have anything with which to compare.

I spent the remainder of the night with Matthew close by. When I went to dance, he joined us. When I went to relax, he took me to his VIP spot and we sat with my roommates and some of his friends.

It wasn't until the night's end that I 'threw myself' at his feet. And I blame the alcohol, one hundred percent.

I had had at least four of Matthew's potent signature cocktails, and I hadn't had much to eat before coming out. Returning to the VIP area, I tripped up the steps and landed on the floor at Matthew's feet.

""Now you throw yourself at me,"" he laughed as he helped me get up.

""I think now is probably a good time for me to go home,"" I slurred.

Matthew helped Emma, Roberta, and Callie get me out of the bar and into a car.

""Make sure she drinks some water and maybe give her an Advil before she goes to bed,"" Matthew told my roommates. I grinned sloppily up at him.

""Thanks, Mr. Davenport, for the wonderful evening,"" I said, drunkenly. ""I just hope I remember it.""

Matthew chuckled as he closed the door and the car drove off.

The following morning, I did not feel well at all. My head was pounding, and my tongue felt like I had spent the night licking the lint trap in the dryer. I groaned as the sunlight streamed into my room.

I dragged my sorry butt out of bed, forced myself into a shower and, bleary eyed, wandered into the kitchen. Emma handed me a cup of coffee.

""Had fun last night, did you,"" she smirked at me. I groaned back.

The doorbell rang just then, which did no wonders for my head. I sat at our kitchen table and put my head in my arms.

""Amelia?"" Emma said, her voice confused and delighted. I looked up, and Matthew was standing in our doorway, a grin on his face and several take-out bags in his hands.

""Good morning,"" he said‚Äîway too cheerfully for this time of day, too cheerful for my headache.

""Hi,"" I groaned.

""I suspected you might be feeling a little under the weather this morning,"" he smiled, holding up the bags. ""So I brought my tried, tested and true hangover cure.""

I looked at the bags, oil and grease adorning them.

""Well, I suppose if I have a heart attack from all the grease, I won't have to worry about the hangover,"" I muttered. Matthew laughed.

I had to admit, though, the greasy food actually did make me feel better.

A few weeks later, we were all heading our separate ways, and I really didn't give Matthew much thought. I returned home for the summer, having chosen which school to attend in the fall.

I worked a summer job at our local library while my siblings enjoyed their summer off and Mom worked as hard as ever.

At the end of August, I left home again for a law school only three hours away. Far enough to need to stay on or around campus, close enough to be home in an emergency, or when I wanted to be.

I focused solely on my studies, not much on the world beyond law school.

Occasionally, I'd hear about Matthew and the Davenport's businesses and successes. But for the most part, it was information on the periphery. My world consisted primarily of law classes, studying, and ensuring Mom was okay.

After graduation, I worked incredibly hard at my articling job, hoping to be hired by the top law firm in the city. I had been snatched up by Hoffman, Givens, and Pratt as a junior law clerk after graduation and was encouraged to stay. I wanted to prove my worth.

She‚Äôd push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn‚Äôt come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was ‚Äútoo messy.‚Äù

Every time I opened up, she'd say: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll just leave.‚Äù

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would‚Ä¶ and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no ‚Äî and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn‚Äôt let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to a party ‚Äî so I said I‚Äôd go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside‚Ä¶ her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: ‚ÄúShould we download an app and find you a hot girl?‚Äù


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn‚Äôt even check on me. Just said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt text you unless you text me first.‚Äù

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should ‚Äújust be friends.‚Äù But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn‚Äôt want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking ‚Äî she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled‚Ä¶ then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic.‚Äù Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday  I didn‚Äôt go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

July 3 I started feeling achy in my legs like I was getting a fever. July 4 my doctor sent me a message about my latest UA. (Every 4 weeks since March.) I had a serious infection (>100,000 colonies) and he sent a prescription over. It was July 4, no pharmacy open. By 8 that night I was in bad shape. By 10 when my daughter got home I was incoherent, not capable of speaking much. Most things from that night aren‚Äôt from me remembering, it‚Äôs from her telling me. Took me to Methodist west. After my CT scan  they transported me to Methodist downtown with a urological emergency. 11 mm kidney stone blocking the ureter, urine going back into the kidney causing it to swell, mild sepsis. My liver was swollen also, I assume that was the sepsis because re: my scan on the 20th my liver is back to normal. Stayed in the hospital July 4-7. The 7th they put the stint in. The urologist wanted to keep me another night because of the sepsis. Whoever was the doc in charge of the hospital discharged me a few hours later. They couldn‚Äôt blast the stone then for fear of spreading the infection throughout my body. On the 14th at work I started leaking urine and burning. I didn‚Äôt have the stent with a string to remove it myself. The actual stent was falling out. Dr told me to pull it. Took the rest of my antibiotics while anxious that it was going to happen again before my appointment on the 23. They thought they were going to blast the stone after that follow up. 

The 20th at work my boss called back and said I can tell you aren‚Äôt feeling ok. You need to take care of yourself, go to the doctor. I did. He sent me to be admitted to the hospital again. UTI and kidney infection. Thanks to my boss insisting I listen to my body we caught it before sepsis set in again. Transported again downtown for another stent, then back to the west hospital because there were no rooms at the main hospital. Released me yesterday with a follow up on the 25th and surgery scheduled for August 5. The stone is too dense to break up. They are going to grab it and then clean up the many stones in my left kidney. Not sure what is going to happen with the many stones in my right kidney. 

I am a mess. I‚Äôve lost 14 lbs (I could stand to lose more) from the 4th - 20th. I can only eat a couple of bites or I throw up. All my joints hurt. I‚Äôve been taking the antispasmodic for my bladder but broke down this morning and took an oxycodone from my first round because my 18 year old daughter is having hip surgery this morning and I‚Äôm not going to miss being there for her. Read my results from my last blood work yesterday, kidney is functioning better but not near where it should be. 

I‚Äôm just exhausted. She told me no more coffee or pop. I said I don‚Äôt drink pop but I had cut out coffee after the first stone cuz that helped my dad. I looked at the oxalates - I don‚Äôt eat my foods high in those because of all of my food allergies. She said we will figure it out.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

Have you ever tried switching to a minimized window on macOS and‚Ä¶ nothing happens? Like you‚Äôre shouting into the void and the window just refuses to wake up? Yeah, personally, I‚Äôve been there.

Maybe you found yourself helplessly wandering the Dock, right-clicking every icon, desperately hoping to spot that sneaky minimized window. Or you opened Mission Control, hoping the magic grid would save the day, only to get lost in the chaos.

And let‚Äôs be honest, the classic Apple Cmd + Tab switcher is great for apps, but it‚Äôs practically useless for minimized windows.

The City of Columbia says a water main break on 9th and Cherry Street Tuesday afternoon was caused by corrosion on a buried pipe.

Utility spokesman Jason West said ""while it is part of the oldest pipes downtown, this particular pipe may be pushing 75-years old.  This was a fairly routine fix, from what I am being told,""

A boil water advisory was issued for nearly 30 businesses in the area until 1 p.m. Wednesday.

The break has been repaired now, a cement slab covers the hole, surrounded by construction cones still blocking off the area.

Colleen Rieman part owner of Hexagon Alley in downtown Columbia said she found out about the break after a call from employees saying the water was not working. She says the break impacted Tuesday trivia night and caused them to turn business out the door.

""Usually Tuesday's are a busier than they were last night we definitely turned some people away last night because of not being  able to have any food,"" Rieman said.

While the water main break was lifted, Rieman said Hexagon Alley would play it safe and use bottled water and bags of ice in hopes to return to normal operations Thursday.

""We bought ice this morning, we bought water bottles, we're just not serving any of our coffee, we're truing to figure out alternatives for the coffee but we're encouraging people to use our bottled beverages,"" Rieman added ""We don't have a stove we don't so it really hard for us to do the safety precautions for that so thats why we had to switch to the bottle water,""

For bathrooms, Rieman said businesses in the area stepped up to help.

""Last night we weren't able to use them so we asked our neighbors across the street let our customers use them but when they closed we kinda had to be like we just don't have a  bathroom for you,"" She said.

Businesses like Booches and Goldie's bagels were also impacted, however Sparky's ice cream got lucky.

Sparky's employee, Clara Strathausen saw the break and says the impact for them was minimal.

 ""A bunch of water going down cherry street i think it is,  only thing that it would have been is parking of course but our water didn't change colors or anything like that,"" Strathausen said.",2,1753355498.0,columbiamo,0,1.0,False

But my husband‚Äôs family turned out to be the complete opposite.

No one expects me to wake up early. In fact, when I felt guilty and started waking up early a few days, apologizing for being late, my MIL gently told me there‚Äôs no need.... ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing much to do at home, you can rest.‚Äù

In the beginning, she encouraged us to go on dates and would even scold my husband if he left me alone to meet his friends. When they found out I love filter coffee, my FIL went out and bought me the exact coffee powder and a decoction filter, just to make me happy. If she ever senses my husband being irritated with me, she actually takes my side.

She doesn‚Äôt let me cook, saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to cook when you move away anyway. While you‚Äôre here, I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù She never interferes in our matters or complains about me to my husband.

Even when we live in a different city, she never asks who‚Äôs cooking or doing chores. She just asks, ‚ÄúAre you both happy?‚Äù and tells my husband to cook if I‚Äôm late from work. Every time she calls, she asks about my wellbeing first. I feel like she's my mother. 

My SIL is equally kind. Me, MIL, and SIL are like a team. When we meet, we cook together, chat, and genuinely have a good time. Before marriage, I spoke to her, felt the warmth, and that‚Äôs one of the reasons I agreed to this marriage.

And my husband? He‚Äôs incredible. We haven‚Äôt had many discussions about dividing chores, but he just does them.. cooks, cleans, and handles almost everything around the house without making it a big deal.

After all the stories I had heard and read, I was prepared for struggles. But life surprised me with kindness.

I'll keep it short and direct.

I am from India, working in Corporate Sales in their coffee vending business. I'll be completing 1 year this September and this is my first job, post completion of my MBA.
I have done fairly well in my organisation, My managers and team is good. 
But I don't liked this job from the beginning, at that time I just don't wanted to be jobless, I am managing clients like Google, Hitachi, Wells Fargo etc, but our internal systems is poor, now they have increased monthly targets, but they always delay in Salaries and Allowances, I have yet to receive my last 2 month allowance, also there is a lot of travel involved as it is a field job, point to be noted this is one of the major FMCG company in India.
I don't want to do sales anymore.

I am thinking of transitioning into Business Analyts roles.
My first question is- is this transition possible?
Next If someone can guide me how to do it?
I have decent knowledge of Excel tools like - Data cleaning, Vlookup, Pivot, Pivot Graps
I have to learn SQL
Also where to find actual job as LinkedIn isn't working for me or guess due to poor resume.

I'm planning a solo trip to Taiwan this October for 13 full days, and I'm very excited! My main focus will be on i culture, nature, and, of course, food. I've previously traveled  to South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and Hong Kong.

I won't be renting any car or scooter during my stay (only bike or e-bike \^\^).

I understand that many trails in Hualien/Taroko Gorge might still be closed through the end of the year , so I'll be skipping that region for this trip. Also, I've read that  Sun Moon Lake  tends to be more for local tourists, and while I appreciate unique atmospheres, I've had the chance to visit some stunning lakes in Europe.

Here is my itinerary:

***Day 1: Taipei***

* Arrival at the airport at 7 AM  - Drop off bag at hostel. - Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall & Liberty Square.
* **Lunch** at Yongkang St.  and chill in a coffee shop while fighting jetlag

***Day 2: Taipei***

* **Morning**: National Palace Museum. *is it really worth visiting? The museum seems a bit too far from downtown*
* **Afternoon:** Taipei 101  - Elephant Mountain.
* **Night:** Night Market, *will it be worthy to go to Rahoe Night Market?*

***Day 3: Taipei - Chiayi***

* **Morning**: Dihua Street.
* **Afternoon**: Hopping on the HSR to Chiayi, I'm hoping to get there in time to see Hinoki Village

**Day 4: Chiayi (Alishan)**

* *Wondering if a stop at Fenqihu will be too much trouble and not leave enough time in Alish*an

***Day 5: Chiayi - Tainan***

* **Morning:**  train to Tainan - Anping Tree House before lunch
* **Afternoon: T**emples
* **Evening:** Sunset at Fort Provintia
* **Night:** YongLe Market - Shennong Street
* will use the city bike to move around

***Day 6: Tainan - Kaohsiung***

* Morning train to Kaohsiung
* Lotus Pond Lake
* Pier-2 Art Center

***Day 7: Kaohsiung - Kenting***

* **Morning:** Bus to Kenting

**Day 8: Kenting**

* Snorkeling/Diving ‚Äì I will be there on the National Day. Will activity centers be closed? I couldn't find the information

***Day 9  Kenting - travel back to Taipei or Taichung***

***Day 10: Taipei or Taichung or anything (night in Taipei)***

\*\*\*Day 11: Taipei (\*\*\*Shifen, Yehliu, night Jiufen tour) - hoping that everything will still be open on Monday

***Day 12: Taipei***

* Slow day in Wulai for hot bath
* **Evening:** Ximending

***Day 13: Taipei***

* Buying souvenirs (Dihua Street/Ximending) or revisiting places I want to see again.
* Evening: flight at 11:30pm

I would be grateful for any tips and advice! Honestly, I feel like this isn't a really effective route. I still have a day to plan but I'm not sure what to do. I have considered hiking in Yangmingshan (but it seems to be a struggle to do it on my own with public transportation), or staying a day in Taichung. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I haven't booked any hotels yet, so I am still flexible, but I have planned to stay next to the main train station each time.

You‚Äôve wandered in the wilderness long enough. Drinking Parklife Kool-Aid, performing daily Coffee & TV chants, and pretending that listening to 13 didn‚Äôt make you question everything. 

But salvation is at hand.

It‚Äôs time to come home.To the one true church.The Holy Empire of Rock 'n' Roll.The sacred, lager-stained altar of OASIS.

Let me introduce you to our glorious and benevolent leader, the Reverend James Hargreaves ‚Äì may his YouTube algorithm always bless your recommended tab.
Yes, that Hargreaves. The unhinged prophet who rises from the ashes of Britpop discourse every Tuesday to deliver another 48-minute sermon on why Be Here Now is actually good, and why Liam is the reincarnation of Christ with better sideburns.
He does not review albums ‚Äì he delivers scripture.He does not analyze b-sides ‚Äì he excavates relics of the sacred Blur Wars.He does not make content ‚Äì he builds a faith.


Now let‚Äôs talk about you, my Blur-loving brethren.
You were seduced by trumpets. Seduced by irony. Seduced by art school mumbling and too many chord changes. But deep down, you know you crave the truth ‚Äì big guitars, bigger egos, and the divine recklessness of the Gallagher gospel.

Ask yourself:

* Did Song 2 ever punch you in the soul the way Rock 'n' Roll Star did?

* Did Beetlebum ever inspire you to throw a chair at your cousin after seven pints of Stella?

* Would Damon Albarn ever start a fight with a tree? Exactly.

The Oasis lifestyle is not for the faint of heart.We don‚Äôt do subtlety. We don‚Äôt do conceptual.We do benders. We do brawls. We do biblical quantities of swagger.And when the Gallagher brothers inevitably reunited, the skies parted and Hargreaves ascended to Britpop Valhalla in a parka made of Noel‚Äôs tears.

So repent. Delete Think Tank. Smash your Vinyl Me, Please limited edition of Modern Life Is Rubbish.

Join the cult.Subscribe to the YouTube channel.Let Hargreaves' wisdom enter your ears like a distorted chorus of angels playing Definitely Maybe on loop.

As the scriptures say: ""Live forever or die in the Blur queue waiting for something to happen.""
Amen.Supersonically yours,

The Rules Are Changing.‚Äù,"Read: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m81e55/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/)

Believe it or not, I‚Äôve made it three whole weeks in this nightmare.

Three weeks of bone-deep whispers, flickering lights, and pale things pretending to be people. And somehow, against all odds, I keep making it to sunrise.

By now, I‚Äôve realized something very comforting‚Äîsarcasm fully intended: The horror here runs on a schedule.

The Pale Lady shows up every night at exactly 1:15 a.m. Not a minute early. Not a second late. She always asks for meat‚Äîthe same meat she already knows is in the freezer behind the store. I never see her leave. She just stands there, grinning like a damn wax statue for two straight minutes‚Ä¶ then floats off to get it herself.

Every third night, the lights go out at 12:43 a.m. Right on the dot. Just long enough for me to crawl behind a shelf, hold my breath, and wonder what thing is breathing just a few feet away in the dark.

And every two days, the ancient intercom crackles to life and croaks the same cheerful death sentence: ‚ÄúAttention Evergrove Staff. Remi in aisle 8, please report to the reception.‚Äù It‚Äôs always when I‚Äôm in aisle 8. It‚Äôs always my name.

The only thing that changes is the freak show of ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù after 2 a.m.

They‚Äôre different from the hostile monster I met on my first shift‚Äîmore‚Ä¶ polite. Fake. On Wednesdays, it‚Äôs an old woman with way too many teeth and no concept of personal space. Thursdays, a smooth-talking businessman in a sharp suit follows me around, asking for the latest cigarettes. I never respond. Rule 4 ‚Ä¶. is pretty clear:¬†**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

And the old man‚Äîmy ‚Äúboss‚Äù‚Äîwell, he‚Äôs always surprised to see me at the end of each shift. Not happy. Not relieved. Just... surprised. Like he‚Äôs been quietly rooting for the building to eat me.

This morning? Same deal. He walked in at 6:00 a.m. sharp, his coat still covered in frost that somehow never melts.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your paycheck,‚Äù he said, sliding the envelope across the breakroom table. $500 for another night of surviving hell.

But this time, something was different in his face. Less dead-eyed exhaustion, more‚Ä¶ pity. Or maybe fear.

‚ÄúSo, promotion‚Äôs the golden ticket out, huh?‚Äù I said, dry as dust, like the idea didn‚Äôt make my skin crawl. Not that I‚Äôd ever take it. That note from my first night still burned in the back of my skull like a warning: DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just looked at me like I‚Äôd said something dangerous.

Finally, he muttered, ‚ÄúYou better hope you don‚Äôt survive long enough to be offered one.‚Äù

Yeah. That shut me up.

He sat across from me, his eyes flicking toward the clock like something was counting down. ‚ÄúThis place,‚Äù he said, voice low like he was afraid it might hear him, ‚Äúafter midnight‚Ä¶ it stops being a store.‚Äù

His gaze didn‚Äôt meet mine. It drifted toward the flickering ceiling light, like he was remembering something he wished he could forget. ‚ÄúIt looks the same. Aisles. Shelves. Registers. But underneath, it‚Äôs different. It turns into something else. A threshold. A mouth. A‚Ä¶ trap.‚Äù He paused, hands tightening around his mug until the ceramic creaked.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something on the other side. Watching. Waiting. And every so often‚Ä¶ it reaches through.‚Äù He took a breath like he‚Äôd just surfaced from deep water. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when people get ‚Äòpromoted.‚Äô‚Äù He said the word like it tasted rotten. I frowned. ‚ÄúPromoted by who?‚Äù He looked at me then.

Just for a second. Not with fear. With resignation. Like he‚Äôd already accepted, his answer was too late to help me. ‚ÄúHe wears a suit. Always a suit. Too perfect. Too still. Like he was made in a place where nothing alive should come from.‚Äù The old man‚Äôs voice went brittle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know him when you see him. Something about him... it doesn‚Äôt belong in this world. Doesn‚Äôt pretend to, either. Like a mannequin that learned how to walk and smile, but not why.‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúEyes like mirrors. Smile like a trap. And a voice you‚Äôll still hear three days after he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù His fingers trembled now, just a little. ‚ÄúThis place calls him the Night Manager.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything at first. Just sat there, staring at the old man while the weight of his words sank in like cold water through a thin coat. The Night Manager. The name itself felt wrong. Too simple for something that didn‚Äôt sound remotely human. I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of every flickering shadow in the corners of the breakroom. The hum of the vending machine behind me sounded like it was breathing.

Finally, I managed to speak, voice quieter than I expected. ‚Äú‚Ä¶How long have you been working here?‚Äù He stared into his coffee for a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was smaller. ‚ÄúI was fifteen. Came here looking for my dad.‚Äù Another pause. Longer this time. He looked like the words hurt. ‚ÄúThere was a girl working with me. Younger than you. Two months in, she got offered a promotion. Took it. Gone the next day. No trace. No mention. Just... erased.‚Äù He kept going, softer now.

‚ÄúFound out later my dad got the same offer. Worked four nights. Just four. Then vanished. No goodbye. No clue. Just... gone.‚Äù Then he looked at me. And I swear, for the first time, he looked human‚Äînot like the tired crypt keeper who hands me my checks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I stopped looking for him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHis fate was the same as everyone else who took the promotion. Just‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù And then the clock hit 6:10, and just like that, he waved me off. Like he hadn‚Äôt just dumped a lifetime of this store‚Äôs lore straight into my lap.

I went home feeling... something. Dread? Grief? Maybe both. But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI still sleep like a rock. Every single night. It‚Äôs a skill I picked up after years of dozing off to yelling matches through the walls. I guess that‚Äôs the only upside to having nothing left to care about‚Äîsilence sticks easier when there‚Äôs no one left to miss you.

There wasn‚Äôt anything left to do anyways. I‚Äôd already exhausted every half-rational plan to claw my way out of this waking nightmare. After my first shift, I went full tinfoil-hat mode‚Äîhours lost in internet rabbit holes, digging through dead forums, broken archives, and sketchy conspiracy blogs. Evergrove Market. The town. The things that whisper after midnight. Nothing. Just ancient Reddit threads with zero replies, broken links, and a wall of digital silence.

Not even my overpriced, utterly useless engineering degree could make sense of it.

By the third night, I gave up on Google and stumbled into the town library as soon as it opened at 7 a.m. I looked like hell‚Äîraccoon eyes, hoodie, stale energy drink breath. A walking red flag.

The librarian clocked me instantly. One glance, and I knew she‚Äôd mentally added me to the ‚Äútrouble‚Äù list.

Still, I gave it a shot.

I asked her if they had anything on cursed buildings, haunted retail spaces, or entities shaped like oversized dogs with jaws that hinged the wrong way.

She gave me the kind of look reserved for people who mutter to themselves on public transit. One perfectly raised brow and a twitch of the hand near the desk phone, like she was debating whether to dial psych services or security.

Honestly? I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed her.

But she didn‚Äôt. And I walked out with nothing but more questions.

This morning, I slept like a corpse again. Three weeks of surviving hell shifts had earned me one thing: the ability to pass out like the dead and wake up to return to torture I now call work.

But the moment I walked through the door, something was wrong.

Not just off‚Äîwrong. It felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, gravity whispering your name. Everything in me screamed: run.

But the contract? The contract said don‚Äôt.

And I‚Äôm more scared of breaking that than dying.

So I stepped inside.

The reception was empty.

No old man. No sarcastic remarks. No frost-covered coat.

I checked the usual places‚Äîthe haunted freezer, aisle 8, even the breakroom.

Nothing. No one.

My shift started quietly. Too quietly.

It was Thursday, so I waited for the schedule to kick in.

Pale Lady at 1:15. The businessman around 3. Then the whispers. The lights. The routine nightmare.

But tonight, the system failed.

At 1:30, the freezer started humming.

In reverse.

Not a metaphor. Literally backwards. Like someone had rewound reality by mistake. The air around aisle five warped with the sound, like it was bending under the weight of something it couldn‚Äôt see.

Even the Pale Lady didn‚Äôt show up tonight. And that freak never misses her meat run.

No flickering lights. No intercom.

Just silence.

Then, at 3:00 a.m., the businessman arrived. Same tailored suit. Same perfect hair. But no words. No stalking. He walked up to the front doors, pulled a laminated sheet from inside his jacket, and slapped it against the glass.

Then he left.

No nod. No look. No goodbye.

Just gone.

I walked up to the door, heart already thudding. I didn‚Äôt even need to read it.

Same font. Same laminate. Same cursed format that had already ruined any hope of a normal life.

Another list.

**NEW STAFF DIRECTIVE ‚Äì PHASE TWO**

*Effective Immediately*

I started reading.

**1. The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**

Cool. Starting strong.

**2. If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**

Because babies are terrifying now, apparently.

**3. A second you may arrive at any time. Do not speak to them. Do not let them speak to you. If they say your name, cover your ears and run to the cleaning supply closet. Lock the door. Count to 200. Wait for silence.**

What the actual hell?

**4. If you find yourself outside the store without remembering how you got there‚Äîgo back inside immediately. Do not look at the sky.**

**5. Something new lives behind the canned goods aisle. If you hear it breathing, whistle softly as you walk by. It hates silence.**

**6. If the intercom crackles at 4:44 a.m., stop whatever you're doing and lie face down on the floor. Do not move. You will hear your name spoken backward. Do not react.**

**7. Do not use the bathroom between 1:33 a.m. and 2:06 a.m. Someone else is in there. They do not know they are dead.**

**8. If the fluorescent lights begin to pulse in sets of three, you are being watched. Do not acknowledge it. Speak in a language you don‚Äôt know until it passes.**

**9. There will be a man in a suit standing just outside the front doors at some point. His smile will be too wide. He does not blink. Do not let him in. Do not wave. Do not turn your back.**

**10. If the emergency alarm sounds and you hear someone scream your mother‚Äôs name‚Äîrun. Do not stop. Do not check the time. Run until your legs give out or the sun rises. Whichever comes first.**

I blinked. Once. Twice.

What the actual hell? April Fools? Except it‚Äôs July. And no one here has a sense of humor‚Äîleast of all me.

I stared at one of the lines, as if rereading it would somehow make it make sense:

""A second you may arrive tonight. Do not speak to them‚Ä¶""

Yeah. Totally normal. Just me and my evil doppelg√§nger hanging out in aisle three.

""Do not look at the sky."" ""Speak in a language you don‚Äôt know."" ""Run until your legs give out or the sun rises.""

By the time I reached the last line, I wasn‚Äôt even scared. Not really. I was numb. Like someone had handed me the diary of a lunatic and said, ‚ÄúLive by this or die screaming.‚Äù

It was unhinged. Unfollowable. Inhuman. And yet?

I didn‚Äôt laugh.

Because I‚Äôve seen things. Things that defy explanation. Things that should not exist. The freezer humming like it‚Äôs rewinding reality. Shadows that slither against physics. The businessman with the dead eyes and the too-quiet shoes who shows up only to tack new horrors to the wall like corporate memos from hell.

This place stopped pretending to make sense the moment I locked that thing in the basement on my first shift.

And that‚Äôs why this list scared the hell out of me.

Because rules‚Äîreal rules‚Äîcan be followed. Survived.

But this? This was a warning stapled to the jaws of something that plans to bite.

I folded the page with shaking hands, slipped it into my pocket like a sacred text, and backed away from the front door.

That‚Äôs when it happened.

That... shift.

Like gravity blinked. Like the air twitched.

The front door creaked‚Äînot the usual automatic hiss and chime, but a long, slow swing like a church door opening at a funeral.

I turned.

And he walked in.

Black shoes, polished like obsidian. A charcoal suit that clung to him like a shadow. Tall. Too tall to be usual but not tall enough to be impossible. And sharp‚Äîlike someone had sculpted him out of glass and intent.

He looked like he belonged on a red carpet or a Wall Street throne.

But in the flickering, jaundiced lights of Evergrove Market, he didn‚Äôt look human.

Not wrong, exactly. Just... off. Like a simulation rendered one resolution too high. Like someone had described ‚Äúman‚Äù to an alien artist and this was the first draft.

His smile was perfect. Too perfect. Practiced, like a knife learning to grin.

The temperature dropped the moment he stepped over the threshold.

He didn‚Äôt say a word. Just stared at me.

Eyes like static‚Äîglass marbles that shimmered with a color I didn‚Äôt have a name for. A color that probably doesn‚Äôt belong in this dimension.

And I knew.

Right then, I knew why the old man warned me. Why he flinched every time I brought up promotions.

Because this was the one who offers them.

From behind the counter, the old man appeared. Quiet. Like he‚Äôd been summoned by scent or blood or fate.

He didn‚Äôt look shocked.

Just... done. Like someone waiting for the train they swore they‚Äôd never board. He gave the tiniest nod. ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù he said, voice barely above a whisper, ‚Äúis the Night Manager.‚Äù

I stared.

The thing called the night manager stared back.

No blinking. No breathing. Just that flawless, eerie smile.

And then, in a voice that slid under my skin and curled against my spine, he said:

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans where one team is *favored* to dominate and the other is‚Ä¶ well, the Chicago Sky, which seems to be grounded more often than not. Let‚Äôs unpack this matchup with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had one too many coffees.

### Parse the Odds: Why the Storm is the Meteorological Marvel

The Seattle Storm (-268 moneyline) are about as likely to lose this game as it is to snow in July‚Ä¶ which, honestly, we‚Äôve all seen happen, but let‚Äôs focus. Their implied probability of winning? A scorching **72.4%**, per the books. That‚Äôs not just a favorite‚Äîit‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äôre pretty sure the Earth is flat, but also that the Storm will win.‚Äù The spread (-6.5) suggests Seattle should win by enough points to make a casual bettor forget they ever doubted them.

Statistically, this is a mismatch. The Storm‚Äôs offense (80.2 PPG) faces a Chicago defense that surrenders 86.5 points per game‚Äîlike a lockbox left open at a bank. Meanwhile, Chicago‚Äôs offense is the WNBA‚Äôs least potent, scoring just 77.6 PPG. It‚Äôs the basketball equivalent of trying to win a race with a pogo stick. Seattle‚Äôs defense, ranked third in the league (78.5 PPG allowed), is essentially a brick wall with a ‚ÄúNo Parking‚Äù sign for the Sky‚Äôs offense.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Inevitabilities, and Angel Reese‚Äôs Back

Chicago‚Äôs injury report reads like a tragic opera. They‚Äôre already without **Ariel Atkins, Michaela Onyenwere, and Courtney Vandersloot**‚Äîthree key contributors who might as well be vacationing in Bali. Now, star forward **Angel Reese** (13.8 PPG, 12.5 RPG) is listed as *questionable* with a back injury. Without her, Chicago loses its emotional engine and its first threat to break the WNBA‚Äôs all-time double-double streak. It‚Äôs like asking a pizza delivery guy to also solve quantum physics.

Seattle, meanwhile, is reuniting a key piece of its puzzle: **Skylar Diggins**, the ‚Äúhuman highlight reel,‚Äù is set to return from personal issues. Coach Noelle Quinn‚Äôs quote‚Äî‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt anybody like her‚Äù‚Äîis the sports equivalent of a middle finger to

## Conclusion
Keurig Dr Pepper‚Äôs Q2 2025 earnings underscore the company‚Äôs resilience and operational discipline amid economic uncertainty and tariff headwinds.

1m81e55,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m81e55/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/,Night shift at the Evergrove Market - Day 1,"My first shift at the Evergroove Market started with a paper sign:

""HIRING!! Night Shift Needed ‚Äì Evergrove Market""

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind‚Äîbold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn‚Äôt out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you‚Äù that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I‚Äôd read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true‚Äîwhich usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I‚Äôd been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends‚Äîjust me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn‚Äôt know my name. It wasn‚Äôt ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn‚Äôt anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I‚Äôd imagined.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,‚Äù I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying ‚ÄúEvergroove‚Äù and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight‚Äîjust a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you‚Äôre desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That‚Äôs when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

‚ÄúWhat d‚Äôyou want?‚Äù he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?‚Äù

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I‚Äôd said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not scared of staying alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done night shifts before.‚Äù I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn‚Äôt know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn‚Äôt have time to waste.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your average night shift,‚Äù he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn‚Äôt quite read. Like he was sizing me up‚Ä¶ or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

‚ÄúFill this out,‚Äù he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre good to start, the shift begins tonight.‚Äù

He paused‚Äîjust long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn‚Äôt.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn‚Äôt want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill‚Äînot from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn‚Äôt smile or nod welcomingly‚Äîjust gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been opened in decades.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be alone most of the time,‚Äù he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. ‚ÄúStock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.‚Äù

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times‚Äîno exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store‚Äîsignals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

‚ÄúSerious business,‚Äù I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. ‚ÄúWhat is this, a hazing ritual?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt laugh. Didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúIf you want to live,‚Äù he said quietly, locking eyes with me, ‚Äúthen follow the rules.‚Äù

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. ‚ÄúYour shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform‚Äôs in the back,‚Äù he added casually, as if he hadn‚Äôt just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly‚Äî10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn‚Äôt place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort‚Äîlike armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn‚Äôt leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again‚Äî10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside‚Äînone of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was‚Ä¶ strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans‚Äîbut barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then‚Äîsilence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath‚Ä¶ then blinked back to life‚Äîdim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or‚Ä¶ resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn‚Äôt know what I was waiting for‚Äîuntil I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren‚Äôt coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîit was, it wasn‚Äôt in a rush. And it wasn‚Äôt trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That‚Äôs when the footsteps‚Äîonce slow and deliberate‚Äîbroke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn‚Äôt think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace‚Äîanyplace‚Äîto hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now‚Äîpounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That‚Äôs how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed‚Äîmy fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn‚Äôt dare turn on my phone‚Äôs light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I‚Äôd have to stay hidden. I didn‚Äôt even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must‚Äôve dozed off‚Äîjust for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

A woman‚Äôs voice‚Äîgentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn‚Äôt 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that‚Äôs when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands‚Äîgray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn‚Äôt smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn‚Äôt answer.

Her smile twitched‚Äîjust a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for something.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ kind of something?‚Äù

She tilted her head‚Äîslowly, mechanically‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt used to the weight of it.

‚ÄúDo you guys have meat?‚Äù she asked.

The word hit harder than it should‚Äôve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. ‚ÄúMeat?,‚Äù I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stared.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you get a new shipment tonight?‚Äù she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that‚Äôs when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle‚Äîbut in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store‚Äôs delivery crate‚Ä¶Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, barely louder than a whisper. ‚ÄúYou can find it in the back‚Ä¶in the frozen section.‚Äù

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt breathe.

And then she said it.

‚ÄúThank you, Remi.‚Äù

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned‚Äîslow, mechanical‚Äîand began walking down the back hallway.

That‚Äôs when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren‚Äôt aligned with her body‚Äîangled just slightly toward the entrance, like she‚Äôd walked in backward‚Ä¶ and never fixed it.

As she walked away‚Äîthose misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum‚ÄîI stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should‚Äôve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly‚Äîno flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn‚Äôt want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I‚Äôd left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it‚Äîone of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape‚Äîget out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn‚Äôt leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup‚Äîbreathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

In the mirror‚Äîwedged between the glass and the frame‚Äîwas a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes‚Äîsteps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn‚Äôt have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

‚ÄúLet me out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bang.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming‚Äîscreaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn‚Äôt exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again‚Äîharder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn‚Äôt a person.

It was a creature‚Äîcrouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face‚Ä¶

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw‚Äîso wide I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn‚Äôt need eyes to know.

Then‚Äî

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store‚Äîshrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn‚Äôt even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

‚ÄúRemi‚Ä¶ in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ report to the reception.‚Äù

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

‚ÄúRemi in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ come to the desk.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt breathe.

But my eyes‚Äîmy traitorous eyes‚Äîdrifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward‚Äîcharging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn‚Äôt wait. I didn't think. Just thought, ‚ÄúScrew this,‚Äù and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws‚Äîreaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren‚Äôt far behind‚Äîhungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn‚Äôt see me.

It didn‚Äôt even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists‚Äîor claws‚Äîbeating against the other side. Screams‚Äîinhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once‚Äîrose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever‚Äîmaybe an hour, maybe more‚Äîwhile the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired‚Äîand too scared‚Äîto ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet‚Äîlike nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here?‚Äù he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. ‚ÄúNo shit, Sherlock.‚Äù

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. ‚ÄúTold you it wasn‚Äôt your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot an average night shift doesn‚Äôt mean you die on the clock, old man,‚Äù I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. ‚ÄúYou followed the rules. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôre still breathing.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. ‚ÄúCan I quit?‚Äù

His eyes didn‚Äôt even flicker. ‚ÄúNope. The contract says one year.‚Äù

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he added, casually, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a way out.‚Äù

I looked up slowly, wary.

‚ÄúYou can leave early,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif you get promoted.‚Äù

That word stopped me cold.

DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

‚ÄúPromotion?‚Äù I asked, carefully measuring the word.

‚ÄúNot many make it that far,‚Äù he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn‚Äôt respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

‚ÄúYou earned it,‚Äù he said, standing. ‚ÄúUniform rack‚Äôll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.‚Äù

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we‚Äôd just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if ‚Äúnot many make it to the promotion,‚Äù that could only mean one thing.

Most don‚Äôt make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should‚Äôve. I slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, hands gripping the wheel‚Äîknuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I‚Äôd be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down‚Ä¶

Forget the old-school image of bots clicking through spreadsheets while you sip coffee. Today‚Äôs RPA is being turbocharged by AI, cloud services, and new development tricks. Developers and business leaders are asking: What‚Äôs new in RPA, and why does it matter? This article dives deep into the latest RPA innovations, real-world use-cases, and tips for getting ahead.

# From Scripts to Agentic Bots: The AI-Driven RPA Revolution

Once upon a time, RPA bots followed simple ‚Äúif-this-then-that‚Äù scripts to move data or fill forms. Now they‚Äôre evolving into *agentic bots* ‚Äì think of RPA + AI = digital workers that can *learn* and make smart decisions. LLMs and machine learning are turning static bots into adaptive assistants. For example, instead of hard-coding how to parse an invoice, a modern bot might use NLP or an OCR engine to *read* it just like a human, then decide what to do next. Big platforms are already blending these: UiPath and Blue Prism talk about bots that call out to AI models for data understanding.

Even more cutting-edge is using AI to *build* RPA flows. Imagine prompting ChatGPT to ‚Äúgenerate an automation that logs into our CRM, exports contacts, and emails the sales team.‚Äù Tools now exist to link RPA platforms with generative AI. In practice, a developer might use ChatGPT or a similar API to draft a sequence of steps or code for a bot, then tweak it ‚Äì sort of like pair-programming with a chatbot. The result? New RPA projects can start with a text prompt, and the bot scaffold pops out. This doesn‚Äôt replace the developer (far from it), but it can cut your boilerplate in half. A popular UiPath feature even lets citizen developers describe a workflow in natural language.

RPA + AI is often called **hyperautomation** or **intelligent automation**. It means RPA is no longer a back-office gadget; it‚Äôs part of a larger cognitive system. For instance, Abto Software (a known RPA development firm) highlights ‚Äúhyperautomation bots‚Äù that mix AI and RPA. They‚Äôve even built a bot that teaches software use interactively: an RPA engine highlights and clicks UI elements in real-time while an LLM explains each step. This kind of example shows RPA can power surprising use-cases (not just invoice processing) ‚Äì from AI tutors to dynamic decision systems.

In short, RPA today is about *augmented automation*. Bots still speed up repetitive tasks, but now they also **see** (via computer vision), **understand** (via NLP/ML), and even **learn**. The next-gen RPA dev is part coder, part data scientist, and part workflow designer.

# Hyperautomation and Low-Code: Democratizing Development

The phrase ‚Äúhyperautomation‚Äù is everywhere. It basically means: use **all the tools** ‚Äì RPA, AI/ML, low-code platforms, process mining, digital twins ‚Äì to automate whole processes, not just isolated steps. Companies are forming Automation Centers of Excellence to orchestrate this. In practice, that can look like: use process mining to find bottlenecks, then design flows in an RPA tool, and plug in an AI module for the smart parts.

A big trend is **low-code / no-code RPA**. Platforms like Microsoft Power Automate, Appian, or new UiPath Studio X empower non-developers to drag-and-drop automations. You might see line-of-business folks building workflows with visual editors: ‚ÄúIf new ticket comes in, run this script, alert John.‚Äù These tools often integrate with low-code databases and forms. The result is that RPA is no longer locked in the IT closet ‚Äì it‚Äôs moving towards business users, with IT overseeing security.

At the same time, there‚Äôs still room for hardcore dev work. Enterprise RPA can be API-first and cloud-native now. Instead of screen-scraping, many RPA bots call APIs or microservices. Platforms let you package bots in Docker containers and scale them on Kubernetes. So, if your organization has a cloud-based ERP, the RPA solution might spin up multiple bots on-demand to parallelize tasks. You can treat your automation scripts like any other code: store them in Git, write unit tests, and deploy via CI/CD pipelines.

Automation Anywhere and UiPath are adding ML models and computer vision libraries into their offerings. In the open-source world, projects like Robocorp (Python-based RPA) and Robot Framework give devs code-centric alternatives. Even languages like Python, JavaScript, or C# are used under the hood. The takeaway for developers: know your scripting languages **and** the visual workflow tools. Skills in APIs, cloud DevOps, and AI libraries (like TensorFlow or OpenCV) are becoming part of the RPA toolkit.

# Real-World RPA in 2025: Beyond Finance & HR

Where is this new RPA magic actually happening? Pretty much everywhere. Yes, bots still handle classic stuff like data entry, form filling, report generation, invoice approvals ‚Äì those have proven ROI. But we‚Äôre also seeing RPA in unexpected domains:

* **Customer Support:** RPA scripts can triage helpdesk tickets. For example, extract keywords with NLP, update a CRM via API, and maybe even fire off an automated answer using a chatbot.
* **Healthcare & Insurance:** Bots pull data from patient portals or insurance claims, feed AI models for risk scoring, then update EHR systems. Abto Software‚Äôs RPA experts note tasks like ‚Äúinsurance verification‚Äù and ‚Äúclaims processing‚Äù as prime RPA use-cases, often involving OCR to read documents.
* **Education & E-Learning:** The interactive tutorial example (where RPA simulates clicks and AI narrates) shows RPA in training. Imagine new hires learning software by watching a bot do it.
* **Logistics & Retail:** Automated order tracking, inventory updates, or price-monitoring bots. A retail chain could have an RPA bot that checks competitor prices online and updates local store databases.
* **Manufacturing & IoT:** RPA can interface with IoT dashboards. For instance, if a sensor flags an issue, a bot could trigger a maintenance request or reorder parts.

Across industries, RPA‚Äôs big wins are still cost savings and error reduction. Deploying a bot is like having a 24/7 clerk who never misreads a field or takes coffee breaks. You hear stories like: a finance team cut invoice processing time by **80%**, or customer support teams saw ‚ÄúSLA compliance up 90%‚Äù thanks to automation. Even Gartner reports and surveys suggest *huge* ROI (some say payback in a few months with 30-200% first-year ROI). And for employees, freeing them from tedious stuff means more time for creative problem-solving ‚Äì few will complain about that.

# Building Better Bots: Development Tips and Practices

If you‚Äôre coding RPA (or overseeing bots), treat it like real software engineering ‚Äì because it is. Here are some best practices and tricks:

* **Version Control:** Store your bots and workflows in Git or similar. Yes, even if it‚Äôs a no-code designer, export the project and track changes. That way you can roll back if a bot update goes haywire.
* **Modular Design:** Build libraries of reusable actions (e.g. ‚ÄúLogin to ERP‚Äù, ‚ÄúParse invoice with regex‚Äù, ‚ÄúSend email‚Äù). Then glue them in workflows. This makes maintenance and debugging easier.
* **Exception Handling:** Bots should have try/catch logic. If an invoice format changes or a web element isn‚Äôt found, catch the error and either retry or log a clear message. Don‚Äôt just let a bot crash silently.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests for your bot logic if possible. Some teams spin up test accounts and let bots run in a sandbox. If you automate, say, data entry, verify that the data landed correctly in the system (maybe by API call).
* **Monitoring:** Use dashboards or logs to watch your bots. A trick is to timestamp actions or send yourself alerts on failures. Advanced RPA platforms include analytics to check bot health.
* **Selectors and Anchors:** UIs change. Instead of brittle XPaths, use robust selectors or anchor images for desktop automation. Keep them up to date.
* **Security:** Store credentials securely (use vaults or secrets managers, not hard-coded text). Encrypt sensitive data that bots handle. Ensure compliance if automating regulated processes.

One dev quip: ‚ÄúYour robot isn‚Äôt a short-term fling ‚Äì build it as if it‚Äôs your full-time employee.‚Äù That means documented code, clean logic, and a plan for updates. Frameworks like Selenium (for browsers), PyAutoGUI, or native RPA activities often intermix with your code. For data parsing, yes, you *can* use regex: e.g. a quick pattern like `\b\d{10}\b` to grab a 10-digit account number. But if things get complex, consider embedding a small script or calling a microservice.

# Why It Matters: ROI and Skills for Devs and Businesses

By now it should be clear: RPA is still *huge*. Reports show more than half of companies have RPA in production, and many more plan to. For a developer, RPA skills are a hot ticket ‚Äì it‚Äôs automation plus coding plus business logic, a unique combo. Being an RPA specialist (or just knowing how to automate workflows) means you can solve real pain points and save clients tons of money.

For business owners and managers, the message is ROI. Automating even simple tasks can shave hours off a process. Plus, data accuracy skyrockets (no more copy-paste mistakes). Imagine all your monthly reports automatically assembling themselves, or your invoice backlog clearing overnight. And the cost? Often a fraction of hiring new staff. That‚Äôs why enterprises have *RPA Centers of Excellence* and even entire departments now.

There‚Äôs also a cultural shift. RPA lets teams focus on creative work. Many employees report feeling less burned out once bots handle the grunt. It‚Äôs not about stealing jobs, but augmenting the workforce ‚Äì a friendly ‚Äúdigital coworker‚Äù doing the boring stuff. Of course, success depends on doing RPA smartly: pick processes with clear rules, involve IT for governance, and iteratively refine. Thoughtful RPA avoids the trap of ‚Äújust automating chaos‚Äù.

Finally, mentioning Abto Software again: firms like Abto (a seasoned RPA and AI dev shop) emphasize that RPA development now often means blending in AI and custom integrations. Their teams talk about enterprise RPA platforms with plugin architectures, desktop & web bots, OCR modules, and interactive training tools. In other words, modern RPA is a platform on steroids. They‚Äôre just one example of many developers who have had to upskill ‚Äì from simple scripting to architecting intelligent systems.

# The Road Ahead: Looking Past 2025

We‚Äôre speeding toward a future where RPA, AI, and cloud all mesh seamlessly. Expect more out-of-the-box *agentic automation* (remember that buzzword), where bots initiate tasks proactively ‚Äì ‚ÄúHey, I noticed sales spiked 30% last week, do you want me to reforecast budgets?‚Äù RPA tools will get better at handling unstructured data (improved OCR, better language understanding). No-code platforms will let even more people prototype automations by Monday morning.

Developers should keep an eye on emerging trends: **edge RPA** (bots on devices or at network edge), **quantum-ready** automation (joke, maybe not yet!), and greater regulation around how automated decisions are made (think AI audit trails). For now, one concrete tip: experiment with integrating ChatGPT or open-source LLMs into your bots. Even a small flavor of generative AI can add a wow factor ‚Äì like a bot that explains what it‚Äôs doing in plain language.

**Bottom line:** RPA development is far from boring or dead. In fact, it‚Äôs evolving faster than ever. Whether you‚Äôre a dev looking to level up your skillset or a company scouting for efficiency gains, RPA is a field where innovation happens at startup speed. So grab your workflow, plug in some AI, and let the robots do the rote work ‚Äì we promise it‚Äôll be anything but dull.",1,1753354975.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

They're both browning processes that create amazing flavors, but fundamentally different.

My understanding is that the Maillard reaction involves amino acids and reducing sugars reacting at relatively lower temps (around 285-330¬∞F), which gives us complex, savory, meaty flavors like you get on a perfectly seared steak or toasted bread.Think of that browned goodness on roasted coffee beans to. Caramelization, on the other hand, is just sugars breaking down at higher temperatures (310-500¬∞F, depending on the sugar), leading to those sweet, nutty, and slightly bitter flavors in caramel or properly caramelized onions. It's fascinating how different ingredients and techniques can really highlight one process over the other.

Does anyone have a favourite example of when they consciously utilized one over the other to achieve a certain flavor profile? Or any tips on controlling one versus the other in specific recipes?

The Rules Are Changing.‚Äù,"Read:¬†[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwk0ql/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/)

Believe it or not, I‚Äôve made it three whole weeks in this nightmare.

Three weeks of bone-deep whispers, flickering lights, and pale things pretending to be people. And somehow, against all odds, I keep making it to sunrise.

By now, I‚Äôve realized something very comforting‚Äîsarcasm fully intended: The horror here runs on a schedule.

The Pale Lady shows up every night at exactly 1:15 a.m. Not a minute early. Not a second late. She always asks for meat‚Äîthe same meat she already knows is in the freezer behind the store. I never see her leave. She just stands there, grinning like a damn wax statue for two straight minutes‚Ä¶ then floats off to get it herself.

Every third night, the lights go out at 12:43 a.m. Right on the dot. Just long enough for me to crawl behind a shelf, hold my breath, and wonder what thing is breathing just a few feet away in the dark.

And every two days, the ancient intercom crackles to life and croaks the same cheerful death sentence: ‚ÄúAttention Evergrove Staff. Remi in aisle 8, please report to the reception.‚Äù It‚Äôs always when I‚Äôm in aisle 8. It‚Äôs always my name.

The only thing that changes is the freak show of ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù after 2 a.m.

They‚Äôre different from the hostile monster I met on my first shift‚Äîmore‚Ä¶ polite. Fake. On Wednesdays, it‚Äôs an old woman with way too many teeth and no concept of personal space. Thursdays, a smooth-talking businessman in a sharp suit follows me around, asking for the latest cigarettes. I never respond. Rule 4 ‚Ä¶. is pretty clear:¬†**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

And the old man‚Äîmy ‚Äúboss‚Äù‚Äîwell, he‚Äôs always surprised to see me at the end of each shift. Not happy. Not relieved. Just... surprised. Like he‚Äôs been quietly rooting for the building to eat me.

This morning? Same deal. He walked in at 6:00 a.m. sharp, his coat still covered in frost that somehow never melts.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your paycheck,‚Äù he said, sliding the envelope across the breakroom table. $500 for another night of surviving hell.

But this time, something was different in his face. Less dead-eyed exhaustion, more‚Ä¶ pity. Or maybe fear.

‚ÄúSo, promotion‚Äôs the golden ticket out, huh?‚Äù I said, dry as dust, like the idea didn‚Äôt make my skin crawl. Not that I‚Äôd ever take it. That note from my first night still burned in the back of my skull like a warning: DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just looked at me like I‚Äôd said something dangerous.

Finally, he muttered, ‚ÄúYou better hope you don‚Äôt survive long enough to be offered one.‚Äù

Yeah. That shut me up.

He sat across from me, his eyes flicking toward the clock like something was counting down. ‚ÄúThis place,‚Äù he said, voice low like he was afraid it might hear him, ‚Äúafter midnight‚Ä¶ it stops being a store.‚Äù

His gaze didn‚Äôt meet mine. It drifted toward the flickering ceiling light, like he was remembering something he wished he could forget. ‚ÄúIt looks the same. Aisles. Shelves. Registers. But underneath, it‚Äôs different. It turns into something else. A threshold. A mouth. A‚Ä¶ trap.‚Äù He paused, hands tightening around his mug until the ceramic creaked.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something on the other side. Watching. Waiting. And every so often‚Ä¶ it reaches through.‚Äù He took a breath like he‚Äôd just surfaced from deep water. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when people get ‚Äòpromoted.‚Äô‚Äù He said the word like it tasted rotten. I frowned. ‚ÄúPromoted by who?‚Äù He looked at me then.

Just for a second. Not with fear. With resignation. Like he‚Äôd already accepted, his answer was too late to help me. ‚ÄúHe wears a suit. Always a suit. Too perfect. Too still. Like he was made in a place where nothing alive should come from.‚Äù The old man‚Äôs voice went brittle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know him when you see him. Something about him... it doesn‚Äôt belong in this world. Doesn‚Äôt pretend to, either. Like a mannequin that learned how to walk and smile, but not why.‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúEyes like mirrors. Smile like a trap. And a voice you‚Äôll still hear three days after he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù His fingers trembled now, just a little. ‚ÄúThis place calls him the Night Manager.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything at first. Just sat there, staring at the old man while the weight of his words sank in like cold water through a thin coat. The Night Manager. The name itself felt wrong. Too simple for something that didn‚Äôt sound remotely human. I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of every flickering shadow in the corners of the breakroom. The hum of the vending machine behind me sounded like it was breathing.

Finally, I managed to speak, voice quieter than I expected. ‚Äú‚Ä¶How long have you been working here?‚Äù He stared into his coffee for a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was smaller. ‚ÄúI was fifteen. Came here looking for my dad.‚Äù Another pause. Longer this time. He looked like the words hurt. ‚ÄúThere was a girl working with me. Younger than you. Two months in, she got offered a promotion. Took it. Gone the next day. No trace. No mention. Just... erased.‚Äù He kept going, softer now.

‚ÄúFound out later my dad got the same offer. Worked four nights. Just four. Then vanished. No goodbye. No clue. Just... gone.‚Äù Then he looked at me. And I swear, for the first time, he looked human‚Äînot like the tired crypt keeper who hands me my checks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I stopped looking for him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHis fate was the same as everyone else who took the promotion. Just‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù And then the clock hit 6:10, and just like that, he waved me off. Like he hadn‚Äôt just dumped a lifetime of this store‚Äôs lore straight into my lap.

I went home feeling... something. Dread? Grief? Maybe both. But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI still sleep like a rock. Every single night. It‚Äôs a skill I picked up after years of dozing off to yelling matches through the walls. I guess that‚Äôs the only upside to having nothing left to care about‚Äîsilence sticks easier when there‚Äôs no one left to miss you.

There wasn‚Äôt anything left to do anyways. I‚Äôd already exhausted every half-rational plan to claw my way out of this waking nightmare. After my first shift, I went full tinfoil-hat mode‚Äîhours lost in internet rabbit holes, digging through dead forums, broken archives, and sketchy conspiracy blogs. Evergrove Market. The town. The things that whisper after midnight. Nothing. Just ancient Reddit threads with zero replies, broken links, and a wall of digital silence.

Not even my overpriced, utterly useless engineering degree could make sense of it.

By the third night, I gave up on Google and stumbled into the town library as soon as it opened at 7 a.m. I looked like hell‚Äîraccoon eyes, hoodie, stale energy drink breath. A walking red flag.

The librarian clocked me instantly. One glance, and I knew she‚Äôd mentally added me to the ‚Äútrouble‚Äù list.

Still, I gave it a shot.

I asked her if they had anything on cursed buildings, haunted retail spaces, or entities shaped like oversized dogs with jaws that hinged the wrong way.

She gave me the kind of look reserved for people who mutter to themselves on public transit. One perfectly raised brow and a twitch of the hand near the desk phone, like she was debating whether to dial psych services or security.

Honestly? I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed her.

But she didn‚Äôt. And I walked out with nothing but more questions.

This morning, I slept like a corpse again. Three weeks of surviving hell shifts had earned me one thing: the ability to pass out like the dead and wake up to return to torture I now call work.

But the moment I walked through the door, something was wrong.

Not just off‚Äîwrong. It felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, gravity whispering your name. Everything in me screamed: run.

But the contract? The contract said don‚Äôt.

And I‚Äôm more scared of breaking that than dying.

So I stepped inside.

The reception was empty.

No old man. No sarcastic remarks. No frost-covered coat.

I checked the usual places‚Äîthe haunted freezer, aisle 8, even the breakroom.

Nothing. No one.

My shift started quietly. Too quietly.

It was Thursday, so I waited for the schedule to kick in.

Pale Lady at 1:15. The businessman around 3. Then the whispers. The lights. The routine nightmare.

But tonight, the system failed.

At 1:30, the freezer started humming.

In reverse.

Not a metaphor. Literally backwards. Like someone had rewound reality by mistake. The air around aisle five warped with the sound, like it was bending under the weight of something it couldn‚Äôt see.

Even the Pale Lady didn‚Äôt show up tonight. And that freak never misses her meat run.

No flickering lights. No intercom.

Just silence.

Then, at 3:00 a.m., the businessman arrived. Same tailored suit. Same perfect hair. But no words. No stalking. He walked up to the front doors, pulled a laminated sheet from inside his jacket, and slapped it against the glass.

Then he left.

No nod. No look. No goodbye.

Just gone.

I walked up to the door, heart already thudding. I didn‚Äôt even need to read it.

Same font. Same laminate. Same cursed format that had already ruined any hope of a normal life.

Another list.

**NEW STAFF DIRECTIVE ‚Äì PHASE TWO**

*Effective Immediately*

I started reading.

**1. The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**

Cool. Starting strong.

**2. If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**

Because babies are terrifying now, apparently.

**3. A second you may arrive at any time. Do not speak to them. Do not let them speak to you. If they say your name, cover your ears and run to the cleaning supply closet. Lock the door. Count to 200. Wait for silence.**

What the actual hell?

**4. If you find yourself outside the store without remembering how you got there‚Äîgo back inside immediately. Do not look at the sky.**

**5. Something new lives behind the canned goods aisle. If you hear it breathing, whistle softly as you walk by. It hates silence.**

**6. If the intercom crackles at 4:44 a.m., stop whatever you're doing and lie face down on the floor. Do not move. You will hear your name spoken backward. Do not react.**

**7. Do not use the bathroom between 1:33 a.m. and 2:06 a.m. Someone else is in there. They do not know they are dead.**

**8. If the fluorescent lights begin to pulse in sets of three, you are being watched. Do not acknowledge it. Speak in a language you don‚Äôt know until it passes.**

**9. There will be a man in a suit standing just outside the front doors at some point. His smile will be too wide. He does not blink. Do not let him in. Do not wave. Do not turn your back.**

**10. If the emergency alarm sounds and you hear someone scream your mother‚Äôs name‚Äîrun. Do not stop. Do not check the time. Run until your legs give out or the sun rises. Whichever comes first.**

I blinked. Once. Twice.

What the actual hell? April Fools? Except it‚Äôs July. And no one here has a sense of humor‚Äîleast of all me.

I stared at one of the lines, as if rereading it would somehow make it make sense:

""A second you may arrive tonight. Do not speak to them‚Ä¶""

Yeah. Totally normal. Just me and my evil doppelg√§nger hanging out in aisle three.

""Do not look at the sky."" ""Speak in a language you don‚Äôt know."" ""Run until your legs give out or the sun rises.""

By the time I reached the last line, I wasn‚Äôt even scared. Not really. I was numb. Like someone had handed me the diary of a lunatic and said, ‚ÄúLive by this or die screaming.‚Äù

It was unhinged. Unfollowable. Inhuman. And yet?

I didn‚Äôt laugh.

Because I‚Äôve seen things. Things that defy explanation. Things that should not exist. The freezer humming like it‚Äôs rewinding reality. Shadows that slither against physics. The businessman with the dead eyes and the too-quiet shoes who shows up only to tack new horrors to the wall like corporate memos from hell.

This place stopped pretending to make sense the moment I locked that thing in the basement on my first shift.

And that‚Äôs why this list scared the hell out of me.

Because rules‚Äîreal rules‚Äîcan be followed. Survived.

But this? This was a warning stapled to the jaws of something that plans to bite.

I folded the page with shaking hands, slipped it into my pocket like a sacred text, and backed away from the front door.

That‚Äôs when it happened.

That... shift.

Like gravity blinked. Like the air twitched.

The front door creaked‚Äînot the usual automatic hiss and chime, but a long, slow swing like a church door opening at a funeral.

I turned.

And he walked in.

Black shoes, polished like obsidian. A charcoal suit that clung to him like a shadow. Tall. Too tall to be usual but not tall enough to be impossible. And sharp‚Äîlike someone had sculpted him out of glass and intent.

He looked like he belonged on a red carpet or a Wall Street throne.

But in the flickering, jaundiced lights of Evergrove Market, he didn‚Äôt look human.

Not wrong, exactly. Just... off. Like a simulation rendered one resolution too high. Like someone had described ‚Äúman‚Äù to an alien artist and this was the first draft.

His smile was perfect. Too perfect. Practiced, like a knife learning to grin.

The temperature dropped the moment he stepped over the threshold.

He didn‚Äôt say a word. Just stared at me.

Eyes like static‚Äîglass marbles that shimmered with a color I didn‚Äôt have a name for. A color that probably doesn‚Äôt belong in this dimension.

And I knew.

Right then, I knew why the old man warned me. Why he flinched every time I brought up promotions.

Because this was the one who offers them.

From behind the counter, the old man appeared. Quiet. Like he‚Äôd been summoned by scent or blood or fate.

He didn‚Äôt look shocked.

Just... done. Like someone waiting for the train they swore they‚Äôd never board. He gave the tiniest nod. ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù he said, voice barely above a whisper, ‚Äúis the Night Manager.‚Äù

I stared.

The thing called the night manager stared back.

No blinking. No breathing. Just that flawless, eerie smile.

And then, in a voice that slid under my skin and curled against my spine, he said:

By Melanie Burton and Adwitiya Srivastava

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Prices of rare earths could rally further given growing demand for Western material, reflected in a recent deal by the United States that has shown its resolve to rebuild the sector outside China, the CEO of top producer Lynas Rare Earths said.

The U.S. Department of Defense this month agreed to a multi-billion dollar deal to become the largest shareholder in the Australian company's peer, MP Materials, the sole U.S. miner of the magnetic metals used in electronics, electric vehicles and aircraft engines.

As part of the deal, it offered a floor price of $110 per kilogram for the two most popular rare earths, a price nearly twice the current Chinese market level.

Lynas CEO Amanda Lacaze, who heads the world's largest rare earths producer outside China, said the MP Materials deal reflected the U.S. government's determination to break Beijing's dominance and to drive investment in its own industry.

""Can (prices) go above $110? Yes and I think the recent detail of the deal is that there would be an expectation for the government that that is likely to happen, because they have negotiated exposure to upside,"" she said.

After Beijing curbed exports earlier this year, automakers panicked over a rare earths supply bottleneck, though those concerns have started to dissipate as Chinese rare earths magnets began to flow again.

Japanese magnet makers had ""significantly increased"" their output over the past quarter due to the Chinese supply shortages, and Lynas was working with them to develop automotive customers outside their home country, Lacaze said.

Lynas beat estimates for fourth-quarter revenue by 10%, driven by higher selling prices across all rare earths products, and entered into a magnet manufacturing deal with South Korea's JS Link.

It received an average selling price of A$60.20 per kg, the highest since the July 2022 quarter, compared with A$42.30 per kg a year earlier.

Shares climbed as much as 4.2% to A$10.57, the highest level since April 5, 2022, compared to a 0.3% decline in the broader Australian mining index

[Pay Dirt: Trump Seeks Critical Minerals in Global Dealmaking](https://www.wmal.com/2025/07/23/pay-dirt-trump-seeks-critical-minerals-in-global-dealmaking/)

https://preview.redd.it/ywx9xtbbqsef1.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=85cead6ee30f6066c2f4ede9d8b19d7b37a7a612

**Tom Howell, Jr. | July 23, 2025**

([The Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/)) ‚Äî President Trump has positioned himself as a tough trade negotiator, peacemaker and champion for U.S. workers during the first six months of his second term.

Connecting all of them are the precious metals, minerals and other valuables that can be extracted from the earth.

Whether it is a U.S.-facilitated peace deal in Africa or the latest trade deal, hardly a day goes by without Mr. Trump or someone on his team bringing up the natural resources that fuel manufacturing and the president‚Äôs ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù dreams.

The resources offer an increasingly important fulcrum, or bargaining chip, in U.S. deals with the rest of the world.

‚ÄúThere is a strong trend toward a ‚Äòminerals-for-security‚Äô or ‚Äòminerals-for-aid‚Äô approach. A new U.S. trade deal with Indonesia, which is a global supplier of copper and other critical minerals, exemplifies this,‚Äù said Christopher J. Dolan, an assistant teaching professor of homeland security and public policy at Pennsylvania State University.

The intense focus on minerals and other coveted elements is an acknowledgment that American industry risks falling behind in military technology, artificial intelligence and other high-tech ambitions unless it gains market share and starts digging and refining at home.

A U.S. Geological Survey report said imports comprised more than half the U.S. consumption for 46 nonfuel mineral commodities in 2024. It was 100% reliant on imports for 15 of those minerals, such as gallium and manganese.

U.S. mining slowed in the final decades of the 20th century as labor and material costs grew alongside environmental restrictions, experts say, and companies looked abroad for minerals.

Mr. Trump is trying to strike deals that tap into foreign resources while spurring a mining boom at home through deregulation and permit reforms.

‚ÄúThey have tremendous copper, quality copper, and probably the most copper ‚Äî and we made a deal with Indonesia,‚Äù Mr. Trump said last week, extolling his latest trade deal to reporters huddled in the Oval Office.

The stakes are high and intertwined with global affairs.

Rare earths and precious elements are critical to 21st-century technologies: renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles, satellites, fiber optics and military uses such as precision-guided munitions and advanced radar.

Mr. Trump‚Äôs focus on minerals was apparent from the start of his term this year.

He talked about annexing Greenland, which has lithium and titanium used in smartphones, semiconductors and other technologies.

His push for Ukraine‚Äôs minerals, in exchange for America‚Äôs financial support against the Russian invasion, led to tense negotiations with Kyiv.

Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy struck a deal that gives the U.S. claims to minerals while helping Ukraine rebuild from the war‚Äôs devastation.

China produces most of the world‚Äôs supply of rare earth minerals used in electric vehicles, weapons systems and semiconductors. The seven rare earths are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.

Samarium, in particular, is used in heat-resistant magnets that are critical components of missiles and fighter jets.

The U.S. has rare earths but fell behind China decades ago when it seemed that importing the minerals would be more cost-effective than extracting and processing them here.

China gobbled up a majority of the export market and sometimes withheld the resources as a diplomatic tool.

During a trade spat this year, the U.S. said China was slow-walking permits to export the minerals to American companies.

A deal negotiated in London resumed shipments. China, in return, received relief on tech-export controls and visas for its students attending U.S. colleges.

Even a Trump-facilitated peace deal between factions in Congo and neighboring Rwanda had a minerals component.

The eastern Congo region has large reserves of valuable, rare minerals, including tungsten.

‚ÄúI was able to get them together and sell it, and not only that, we‚Äôre getting for the United States a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo,‚Äù Mr. Trump said.

This approach has potential downsides.

‚ÄúLinking humanitarian aid or peacekeeping efforts to mineral access might raise ethical concerns, especially if it looks to exploit conflict-affected nations for economic benefit,‚Äù Mr. Dolan said. ‚ÄúIt may also increase competition with other major countries like China, resulting in a new competition in Africa or other resource-rich regions or result in a disregard for environmental, social and governance and prolong unethical mining operations.‚Äù

Links between earthly treasures and geopolitical concerns are hardly new.

‚ÄúIt was true with oil for more than 40 years, until the shale revolution increased U.S. oil production enormously,‚Äù said Scott Montgomery, a geoscientist and lecturer at the University of Washington. ‚ÄúBut for those decades, ‚Äòforeign oil‚Äô ‚Äî meaning, above all, importing crude from OPEC countries ‚Äî defined a major national security and foreign policy concern.‚Äù

Now, the focus is on precious minerals. The White House hopes to kick-start U.S. production while using quick executive actions and bilateral relationships to secure resources abroad.

The Biden administration was concerned about precious minerals, though it worked more deliberatively and collaborated with multiple countries, particularly to speed the green energy transition.

‚ÄúThe Biden administration moved more slowly, was more process-driven, and was more collaborative and often behind the scenes. The Trump administration‚Äôs approach is quick, with little emphasis on process, and more focused on U.S. interests narrowly defined,‚Äù said Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

He said demand for certain minerals may decrease because the Republican-led Congress withdrew funding for some green energy projects in its One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order for agencies to speed the approval of minerals production projects.

The U.S. is tapping into rare earth minerals in promising projects such as MP Materials‚Äô Mountain Pass mining in California and Ramaco Resources‚Äô Brook Mine operation in Wyoming.

‚ÄúDeveloping \[these minerals\] at a high level again is already running into serious problems, with challenges from local people, including native groups, and from environmental rules,‚Äù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚ÄúThis helps explain the Trump administration‚Äôs attempts to expedite permitting, reduce regulations, and pursue other avenues to foster development.‚Äù

The Essential Minerals Association, a trade group, said it supports policies that will ‚Äúlessen America‚Äôs dependence on hostile nations,‚Äù but it recognizes that it doesn‚Äôt have deposits for every mineral necessary for its manufacturing. It would like the administration to collaborate with Canada and Mexico ‚Äúto help support those demands.‚Äù

The association wants the administration to be ‚Äúequally aggressive‚Äù in developing processing facilities alongside extraction and wants consistency in U.S. policies.

‚ÄúWhile we applaud the administration‚Äôs focus and investment in rapid domestic mineral development,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúit is imperative that Congress pass reforms that will provide the business community with certainty that they will not see dramatic shifts in our laws and regulations after every election.‚Äù

**""NioCorp is now empowered to accelerate field activities and other pre-construction work streams so that the Elk Creek Project can get out of the blocks that much faster once full project financing is obtained,""**¬†said Mark A. Smith, NioCorp CEO and Executive Chairman.¬†***""Early capital helps us get a jump in many different areas that in turn should help us accelerate bringing our products to market that much sooner. There is both an economic and a national defense imperative to getting strategic U.S. resources like the Elk Creek Project online as rapidly as possible.""***

**""Our success in raising equity capital also provides important support and momentum to our ongoing engagement with the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other debt finance providers as we continue to assemble our project financing,"" he said.**

Mr. Smith added:¬†**""With the intensive new focus and additional government funding by the Trump Administration to accelerate critical minerals mining, processing and supply chain development in the U.S., we feel a responsibility to accelerate our efforts to deliver multiple critical mineral products to market.""**

Among the initiatives that NioCorp intends to launch as it continues to advance the Project are these:

* Additional land acquisition
* Geomechanical field work
* Hydrogeological field work;
* Detailed engineering
* Early works / site preparation
* Infrastructure development
* Utility hookups
* Operational permitting
* Continuing build-out of the owner's team
* Other project advancement efforts

I personally think Coffee Dripper might be it, as the extra energy gives you a lot of opportunity to not take as much chip damage so that you need to depend on resting. And while resting definitely has it's place in climbing the Spire, upgrading cards is definitely the more desirable option, as it gives you more power, also reducing your average damage taken per combat. Also there are still alternative healing sources, it doesn't completely lock you out of getting healed like Mark of Bloom, it just prevents you from using the easiest access of healing 

Philosopher's Stone is in a similar boat, that the extra energy helps you dealing with the extra damage coming your way, but I think some combats can become quite dangerous with even just a single point of damage more per hit 

I think an honorable mention is Hovering Kite, because it basically is free energy without a downside. Sure it has a requirement to gain that energy, but a lot of good Silent decks want you to discard shit anyways. But it's Silent exclusive, so it surely doesn't quite count as being ""universal""  ",49,1753354028.0,slaythespire,68,0.93,False

Vet said he‚Äôs been in pain and was surprised no one noticed (I‚Äôm not surprised) so for the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve been going and seeing him morning and evening and just keeping an eye on him. I feel immense guilt regarding these dogs and 2 tortoises we have because they grew up in front of me and when I went low contact, I couldn‚Äôt see them as often as I‚Äôd like. Now 2 days ago, I went to see him and my mother, who‚Äôs an artist, was sitting in her studio with the dogs and was painting. She didn‚Äôt look up or anything (not that I cared) but continued painting and said casually and I quote ‚ÄúJuliet is probably dead, she‚Äôs lying there‚Äù. Juliet is one of the tortoises. We‚Äôve had them for 20 years. I looked where she gestured and there she was. Just lying there. Dead. Near the dogs. The sheer cruelty in the situation and I knew I had to get out of there. I put my hand on her shell and thanked her quietly and said my goodbye and left. An hour later my father calls me and says ‚ÄúJuliet is starting to stink, we‚Äôve told the help to bury her‚Äù. I said okay and hung up. I‚Äôve been in therapy for a while (EMDR) and we‚Äôve discussed strategies and one of them was to recognize the feeling and get out of there or hang up when my parents do their crap. So I did that with both interactions. That night this memory popped up. I was 4. We lived in my first house where I was born. It was a Sunday. I woke up and came out of the room and saw my mom was in the kitchen and my dad was in the living room reading his newspaper so I went to him and put my hand on his knee for him to notice and pick me up. I was so sleepy. He looked at me and then looked up (I now know he was looking at the clock) and then slapped me hard across my face. There was a coffee table there with a shelf underneath and I went through the shelf. My mom heard the sound and came out and asked my dad what happened and he said it‚Äôs almost 9 am and she‚Äôs not ready for school and my mom said it‚Äôs Sunday and went back into the kitchen and dad goes back to reading his newspaper. I‚Äôm trying to get out of the table and my sister is standing at our bedroom door and beckoned me to her and I went. I was 4 and must‚Äôve been dressing myself for school everyday. I‚Äôm not surprised what‚Äôs happening to our pets. Once they‚Äôre all gone, I‚Äôll go no contact. While they‚Äôre alive, I‚Äôll do what I can for them but I won‚Äôt be polite or anything with these motherfuckers. When my mother is dying the last thing I want to her to hear is my voice in her ears saying ‚ÄúDie, Bitch‚Äù. When my father dies, I won‚Äôt be present. ",2,1753353914.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Mental health challenges like OCD and social anxiety can be deeply disruptive, but effective help is available. In Los Angeles, a growing number of professionals are dedicated to treating these specific issues with care and precision. Whether you‚Äôre struggling with intrusive thoughts or overwhelming fear in social situations, finding experienced OCD specialists in Los Angeles or social anxiety therapists in Los Angeles can make all the difference.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. It involves more than a desire for order‚Äîit‚Äôs characterized by unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that are difficult to control. The good news is that with the right [**OCD therapy Los Angeles**](https://www.cbtherapyla.com/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/) providers offer, symptoms can significantly improve.

OCD treatment typically involves evidence-based practices like Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), a form of cognitive behavioral therapy proven effective in reducing compulsive behaviors. A trained OCD therapist Los Angeles clients rely on will guide individuals through gradual exposure exercises, helping them confront their fears in a structured and supportive way.

At the same time, social anxiety‚Äîmarked by an intense fear of judgment or embarrassment in public‚Äîis another condition that affects many Angelenos. Whether it‚Äôs speaking in meetings, attending parties, or even ordering coffee, these situations can feel overwhelming. [**Social anxiety therapists in Los Angeles**](https://www.cbtherapyla.com/anxiety/) provide targeted therapy to help clients build confidence and manage these fears with practical tools.

While medication may be part of the treatment plan for some, the core of both OCD and social anxiety therapy is often talk-based and behavior-focused. Sessions with an [**OCD specialist Los Angeles**](https://www.cbtherapyla.com/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/) residents trust typically involve identifying triggers, challenging irrational thoughts, and developing healthier coping strategies.

Los Angeles is home to a diverse range of therapy providers, many of whom offer flexible treatment options including virtual sessions. This makes it easier than ever to connect with the right [**OCD therapist Los Angeles**](https://www.cbtherapyla.com/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/) or a specialist in social anxiety, even with a busy schedule or transportation challenges.

Families and loved ones can also play an important role. Therapists often include family education as part of OCD therapy in Los Angeles, helping relatives understand the condition and support their loved one‚Äôs progress. Social anxiety therapy may also address how relationships are affected, improving communication and emotional safety within families.

Whether you‚Äôre seeking therapy for yourself or a loved one, taking the first step can feel daunting. But with the right guidance from social anxiety therapists in Los Angeles or experienced OCD professionals, long-term relief is possible. These conditions don‚Äôt have to control your life‚Äîrecovery and confidence are within reach.",1,1753353754.0,u_Naive-Pineapple553,0,1.0,False

For most people, it comes down to spending $150 on a continuous monitor versus $40‚Äì50 on a single-use test. While test kits do work, they‚Äôre less convenient.  
  
My take? If you're in a high-radon zone (check EPA's map), your lungs deserve the upgrade. Here's why:  
  
Long-term testing (3‚Äì12 months) provides the most accurate average radon level in your home. Prefer real-time data? A continuous monitor is the way to go. Why? Because radon isn‚Äôt evenly distributed‚Äîit‚Äôs like adding cream to coffee without stirring. If you only test one spot, readings will fluctuate dramatically as the radon (like the cream) gradually disperses.  
  
That‚Äôs why quality monitors track both short-term spikes and long-term averages. Our recommendation? Run the device for at least 30 days to gather enough data for reliable results.

1m80s2z,https://i.redd.it/k52bbchgusef1.jpeg,George (14) doesn't care if he has limited vision. He still wants to go outside.,"So George is continuing to recover well. He's being very affectionate, starting to become more vocal, and has started jumping onto the kitchen counter and the coffee table again!

He is also starting to show an interest in going outside again. Normally George just chills in the back garden, goes to my neighbour's house, or plays in the grass over the big fence. But of course, when he can't see out his left eye, I don't really want him in the grass over the fence since I can't watch him. And while he gets on with my neighbour's cats, they might sneak up on him on his left which will scare him and he'll smack them which he's done with his brother. 

I'm happy George is feeling well enough he's showing an interest in going outside and I'm glad he's not shouting to go outside because he's very demanding and will meow for hours before giving up.  But oh boy, I need to get back into the habit of making sure George won't run outside whenever I put the laundry on the washing line or when the dog needs to go out again. He's not shown an interest in going out for a while so I've not really had to focus on this too much. ",70,1753352929.0,seniorkitties,1,1.0,False

Stage 3, sometimes 4. We live in a big house and every room is filled with stuff and absolutely messy. She works with clothes so she says its just her job but she hoards everything, from used packages to my old childhood toys to vinyls to jewelry and etc. It's gotten to the stage where sometimes you cant even get in the rooms and the stove broke 2 years ago and she just wont fix it. 

She says we don't  need it, so i have been eating anything that doesn't require cooking like sandwiches and fruits and take out since then. 2 out of 3 bathrooms dont have a working toilet or hot water, a few windows are broken, a lot of stuff is moldy, the washing machine broke, every electrical appliance like toaster and water heater thingy for coffee are also now broken because the eletrical wiring is all messed up. Half the lights of the house just dont work because of ot and one time the outlet actually caught on fire but thankfully it was small and it died before i could even try to do anything. 

My mom just does not care. Its just me and her in the house, with her 8 dogs. 7 of them she got 2 years ago plus my childhood dog. I have 2 cats that i adopted 6 years ago, and now im in a constant state of anxiety because the dogs hunt and kill cats. Thankfully they dont go out of the house. Somehow she doesn't see the issue. My mom does her best in taking care of the dogs but honestly they're too lonely and sometimes we take a while to notice if they get sick or hurt. I don't care if its wrong of me, I refuse to take care of them because they're not my dogs, they're hers. They're also constantly fighting and we have to keep two of them separated because they're smaller and they'd get killed. I only managed to convince my mom to keep them separated because one of the 2 got attacked in the throat and almost died. 


I'm only explaining all of this because i need someone to tell me I'm not insane in thinking that she needs help and that I'm not exaggerating. Everyone I talk to just seems to think i should get over it and deal with her mess all by myself, as if its easy to clean up a hoarder house while the hoarder just keeps buying more stuff to clutter the house. She actually opens the garbage bags i throw out and puts everything back in place.

 I'm 20 years old, in college and I have pots, autism and adhd, things are already hard for me. In the summer my pots flares up a lot and I basically can't function as much because of it. I'm really prone to getting depression episodes where i become worse than my mom and my room starts to get so cluttered and dirty it looks like a level 7 hoarder room. I've been struggling a lot with my mental health since i was 12 and my mom just does not care. It's like I've been living with a roommate or a stranger who never had any responsability with me. I'm grown now but I still need more help than the average person. Its really difficult, she cares only about her stuff and her dogs. I don't know how to get through to her. I could live with my aunt but she wont let me bring my cats. My stepdad died and my dad abandoned me so I don't have a lot of people. I'm tired of trying and I'm tired of living in a place where i can't even eat warm food and I'm scared I'm going to become a hoarder like her",3,1753352900.0,ChildofHoarder,2,1.0,False

I feel crappy for this‚Ä¶But I HATE my boyfriend‚Äôs dog.,"I‚Äôve never hated an animal before. I‚Äôve disliked them depending on the animal and their temperament. But I think I legit hate my boyfriend‚Äôs dog. 

Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year now and I‚Äôve grown more and more into a deep dislike for his dog. 

For a little bit of context, this dog is a legitimate a**hole. She has bit several people in her life for invading her space. Nothing dramatic or scary, they were just in her space. Plenty of dogs know not to bite for the reasons she does. And she bit my daughter last October for doing nothing but reaching to grab something she dropped under the coffee table near her. The dog saw her before that and she was slow and quiet. So she was not startled. I let it go because I wasn‚Äôt going to be the girl that made him put his dog down or give her away. I wanted to like her. But after that it was a no. 
She‚Äôs a jealous thing that poops in my daughter‚Äôs room here all the time out of jealousy. She can very easily hold it. She only does it when my daughter has been here (I coparent) or if she‚Äôs not been given all the attention she thinks she deserves in a day. 

She refuses to eat her dog food because she only wants people food and that makes her throw up with too much obviously. I just can‚Äôt stand to look at her without feeling my chest tighten. 

I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a dog person. But I‚Äôm really not a THIS dog person. But I‚Äôm not going to be the jerk that sends her away because her behavior problems make me mad and anxious. But I want her gone. She‚Äôs older and clearly shouldn‚Äôt be around children. I know the small context I gave may not seem like much to be upset about. But I can‚Äôt stand her. I wish I could get over it but I have not been able to yet. ",2,1753352800.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.75,False
