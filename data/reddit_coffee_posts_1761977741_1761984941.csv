I've been in the neighborhood for a while and I'm looking to expand my social circle and meet some cool people. I live around the metro station area, which makes meeting up pretty convenient.
I'm in my early 20s, and I'm big on hobbies that keep me busy. I'm a massive car and bike enthusiast (always down to talk about weekend drives or cool design), and I keep up with the latest in tech and gadgets. Beyond that, I just enjoy good conversation and chilling out.
I'd love to grab a chai or coffee this week and connect. If you're looking for a new friend to chat with, whether it's about the neighborhood, a new show, or one of my interests, drop a comment or send me a DM!
Looking forward to meeting some of you!

can't decide which one to pick from the current offering of Sey and Prodigal at Kofio. I have too much coffee already but would still like to get one bag as these two roasters are not available very often in the EU (especially SEY). 

I prefer clean washed coffees but open for other processing methods too. Are there any standouts from the coffees they are offering that you enjoyed a lot or that were a bit underwhelming?

1oli9lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1oli9lu/anyone_have_this_please/,Anyone have this please,"Her husband had spent the day tending to another woman's visible, dramatic tears, all the while ignoring her, her everything.
Every time, Bella had swallowed her disappointment.
She had told herself she was the bigger person.
She had told herself that Isla's childhood, a tumultuous mess of divorcing, neglectful parents excused her behavior, that Zayden was the only stability she'd ever known.
But the excuses were wearing thin, eroded by the constant, drip-drip-drip of neglect.
Until that anniversary, Zayden's phone rang again.
The same script. The same promise.
Bella didn't react. She didn't cry. She just felt tired.
She just looked at him, her face a smooth, impassive mask.
She looked at the man holding another woman on his wedding anniversary.
She looked at her overnight bag, packed for a surprise that would never happen.
And in that moment, the last thread of hope snapped.
She understood now. It would never change. There would always be another crisis. Another excuse. Another Isla.
Without a word, she turned her back on them. 
She left Zayden standing in the doorway, holding a sobbing Isla, his anniversary plans evaporating around him, completely unaware that he had just broken something that could never, ever be fixed.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The first thing Bella registered was the silence.
It was a thick, expensive silence, the kind paid for by double paned windows and vast, empty space.
Sunlight, the pale gold of a late California morning, streamed through the floor to ceiling windows of the kitchen, catching on the dust motes dancing in the air.
It was a perfect picture. A still life of wealth and tranquility. And to Bella Rossi-Knight, it felt as hollow as a gilded birdcage.
Her bare feet were silent on the cool marble as she moved to the state of the art espresso machine, the centerpiece of a kitchen that looked more like a surgical suite than a place where meals were cooked with love.
The machine hissed and gurgled, a familiar sound that did little to puncture the quiet.
She poured the dark, aromatic brew into a single mug, a beautiful, hand crafted piece of pottery she had bought at a market, a stark contrast to the clinical perfection of everything else.
This was her life. A breathtaking, multi-million dollar penthouse overlooking the Pacific.
A husband who was the darling of the tech world, handsome, brilliant, and devastatingly charming.
A successful career of her own, her paintings selling for sums that still sometimes stunned her.
On paper, it was a dream. From the inside, some days, it felt like a beautifully appointed waiting room.
She was pulling eggs from the Sub-Zero refrigerator when the sound of footsteps broke the silence.
Zayden.
She would know the confident, measured cadence of his walk anywhere.
He entered the kitchen, already a vortex of energy, his presence immediately filling the vast room.
Dressed in a tailored charcoal suit that cost more than her first car, his dark hair still damp from the shower, he looked every inch the powerful CEO he was.
He smelled of sandalwood and clean, expensive soap.
""Morning, Belle,"" he said, his voice a low rumble that still, after five years of marriage, could send a shiver down her spine.
 He didn't look up from his phone, his thumbs flying across the screen.
""Good morning,"" she replied, her voice softer. ""I'm making omelets. Hungry?""
""Just coffee. I've got a board meeting that starts in..."" he finally glanced at his watch, a sleek piece of platinum that probably told the time on Mars, ""...forty-five minutes. Jacobs is sending the car around early. We need to prep.""
We. The royal 'we'. He and his ever loyal VP, no doubt. Bella nodded, turning back to the counter to hide the flicker of disappointment.
Another meal alone. She cracked the eggs into a bowl anyway. She wanted to make one for herself. The yellow yolks looked like tiny suns.
Zayden finally put his phone down and came up behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder.
He pecked her neck, just below her ear, and for a moment, the hollowness receded, filled by the solid, warm reality of him.
""I'm sorry about this week,"" he murmured against her skin. ""I know I've been buried. It's just this new acquisition. It's a beast.""
""I know,"" she said, leaning back into him. ""It's okay.""
And it was. She understood the pressures of his world. She truly did. She had fallen in love with his drive, his ambition, the fierce intelligence in his storm grey eyes.
""It'll calm down soon,"" he promised, his hands splaying across her stomach. ""And then we'll get away. Just you and me. Somewhere with no phones. No emails. Just a beach and a lot of sunscreen.""
The image was so perfect, so them, that Bella felt her heart squeeze. ""I'd like that.""
His phone buzzed on the counter, vibrating with an insistent, jarring rhythm. He sighed, his embrace loosening. ""That'll be Jacobs."" He let her go to pick it up, but the screen didn't show his VP's name.
It showed Isla.
Bella's spine went rigid. She didn't mean to look, but the name was like a splash of ice water.
Zayden's expression shifted from focused CEO to one of mild concern. He swiped to answer, putting the phone to his ear. ""Isla? Everything okay?""
Bella turned back to her eggs, whisking them with a force that wasn't necessary. She could only hear his side of the conversation.
""Whoa, slow down. What happened?"" A pause. His brow furrowed. ""He did what? At the restaurant? Jesus."" Another pause, longer this time. Bella could picture it, Isla on the other end, her voice probably trembling with manufactured tears, weaving a story of some fresh injustice against her.
Bella focused on the sizzle of butter in the pan, the sound a welcome distraction from the low, soothing tone of Zayden's voice. The tone he used exclusively for Isla's crises.
""Okay, just... just breathe. Where are you now?"" He listened, pinching the bridge of his nose. ""Alright. Stay there. I'll call you right back.""
He ended the call and let out a long breath. The silence that followed was heavier than before.
""Everything alright?"" Bella asked, her voice carefully neutral as she poured the eggs into the pan.
""It's Isla,"" he said, as if she hadn't already deduced that. ""That guy she's been seeing, Mark? Apparently, he just broke up with her. In the middle of dinner last night. Made a scene and left her there to pay the bill. She's a wreck.""
Bella kept her eyes on the omelet, gently pushing the set edges toward the center. ""That's terrible,"" she said, the words feeling scripted. ""She must be so embarrassed.""
""She's devastated,"" Zayden corrected, his voice tight with a protectiveness that was never, ever directed at her. ""She's alone at her apartment. She doesn't have anyone else, Bella.""
The unspoken accusation hung in the air between them: Unlike you.
He was already scrolling through his contacts. ""I need to call Jacobs, tell him to push the meeting back an hour. I have to go over there.""
The whisk clattered against the stainless-steel bowl. Bella forced her hands to be still. ""Zayden, you have a board meeting. For the multi-million dollar acquisition. The 'beast'.""
""I know what I have,"" he said, a edge of impatience in his voice. ""This will just take an hour. She needs me.""
I need you, she thought, the words screaming silently in her head.
I made you omelettes. I was going to tell you about the gallery that wants my new collection.
I needed to feel like your wife this morning, not just the woman who shares your penthouse.
But she didn't say any of that. She had said variations of it before, and it always led to the same argument.
The same defense. ""You know her history. You know how her family is. She's like a sister to me. I can't just abandon her.""
So, instead, she turned and offered him a small, tight smile. The smile of an Understanding Wife. ""Okay. Just... try not to be too long.""
He looked relieved, as if he'd been expecting a fight. He crossed the kitchen and pecked her forehead, a dismissive, perfunctory gesture. ""You're the best. I'll make it up to you. I promise.""
He was already out of the kitchen, phone to his ear, telling Jacobs the meeting was pushed to ten-thirty, his voice fading down the hall. A moment later, she heard the elevator doors ping open and then slide shut.
The silence rushed back in, louder than before.
Bella stood there, staring at the perfect, half cooked omelet in the pan. The edges were beginning to brown, to curl and crisp from neglect. Slowly, she reached over and turned off the burner.
She didn't feel angry. She didn't even feel sad anymore.
She just felt tired. A deep, soul level exhaustion that no amount of perfect sunlight or expensive coffee could fix.
She looked around her beautiful, silent, empty kitchen, her gilded cage. And for the first time, the thought that surfaced wasn't one of patient understanding.
It was a simple, quiet, and terrifyingly clear question:
Is this all there is?
......
The perfectly cooked omelet congealed on the plate, a monument to a breakfast that would never be eaten.
Bella stood motionless for a long time, listening to the hum of the refrigerator, a sound that seemed to amplify the void Zayden had left behind.
The warmth of his embrace had already faded from her skin, replaced by the cool, sterile air of the penthouse.
With a sigh that came from the very depths of her being, she scraped the uneaten food into the disposal.
The violent grind of the machine felt like an appropriate soundtrack to the churning in her stomach.
""I'll make it up to you. I promise.""
The words echoed in the silence, hollow and worn thin from overuse.
How many times had he made that exact promise?
How many canceled dates, missed openings, and interrupted intimate moments had been glossed over with that phrase?
She tried to cling to the image he had painted, the two of them on a beach, no phones, no emails.
It had felt so real for a moment, a tangible future she could almost reach out and touch. Now, it felt like a fantasy he sold them both to keep the peace, a beautiful lie they pretended to believe.
Her own phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts.
A notification flashed on the screen: a reminder for her meeting with the curator of the 'Veridian Gallery' at 2 PM.
Excitement, pure and unadulterated, flickered in her chest, a tiny flame trying to ignite in the damp emptiness.
This was her news. This was what she had wanted to share with Zayden. The Veridian was a major step up, a chance to reach a whole new audience. It was everything she'd been working for.
She had imagined his face, the proud, fierce grin that could light up a room.
She had imagined him sweeping her into a hug, his congratulations loud and genuine.
Instead, she had gotten a distracted pecking on the forehead and a rushed exit for Isla's latest drama.
The flame of excitement sputtered, threatened by the cold drip of resentment.
She wouldn't let it extinguish. This was hers.
Determined, Bella carried her coffee mug to her studio, a spacious, sun drenched room that was the one place in the penthouse that felt truly, entirely hers.
Canvases leaned against white walls, splashed with the vibrant, emotional colors that were her signature.
The smell of turpentine and oil paint was her sanctuary. Here, she wasn't just Zayden Knight's wife; she was Bella Rossi, the artist.
She spent the next few hours losing herself in her work, adding layers of deep cerulean and burnt umber to a large seascape.
The focus required was a welcome distraction, the act of creation a balm on the raw edge of her morning disappointment.
Yet, every time her concentration wavered, her gaze drifted to her silent phone. No message from Zayden. No ""How's your day?"" No ""Thinking of you."" No ""Sorry again.""
By the time she needed to get ready for her meeting, a heavy weight of resignation had settled over her.
This was the pattern.
Isla would have a crisis.
Zayden would run.
Bella would be understanding.
And life would continue its perfectly manicured, deeply lonely course.
She dressed carefully for the curator, choosing a tailored, artistic ensemble that spoke of confidence, a deep emerald green dress and a statement necklace she had made herself.
She looked in the mirror and practiced her smile. It was a good smile. It almost reached her eyes.
As she was gathering her portfolio, her phone finally rang. Her heart did a foolish, hopeful leap before she saw the caller ID.
It wasn't Zayden.
It was Isla.
Bella stared at the screen, her blood running cold. The audacity of it. The sheer, unbelievable gall. This woman, who had just hijacked Bella's husband and morning, was now calling her?
For a wild second, she considered answering. She could picture the performance: Isla's voice, thick with faux-concern. ""Oh, Bella, I'm so sorry he had to run out. You know how Zayden is, my knight in shining armor. I hope you're not too upset? He just knows I have no one else.""
The phone rang until it went to voicemail.
Bella stood there, trembling with a anger so sharp and sudden it stole her breath.
It wasn't just at Isla. It was at Zayden for making her a party to this dynamic. It was at herself for enduring it.
She took a deep, steadying breath. She would not let Isla poison this day, too.
The meeting at the Veridian Gallery was a triumph.
The curator, a sharp eyed woman named Evelyn, was effusive in her praise.
She loved the new collection, spoke of a featured solo show, and used words like ""groundbreaking"" and ""evocative.""
For a glorious hour, Bella was floating. She was seen. 
She was valued for her own mind, her own talent.
She emerged onto the sunlit street, her portfolio feeling lighter than air, a genuine smile on her face.
She pulled out her phone, the urge to share the news with Zayden an automatic reflex. She started to type a text: ""Meeting was amazing! They want a solo show! Can't wait to tell you-""
Her thumb hovered over the send button.
And she stopped.
She pictured him. Was he still at Isla's? Had he solved the crisis of the dumped-by-Mark? Was he now taking her out for a comforting lunch, listening to her dissect every moment of the failed relationship?",1,1761984135.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

It wasn't just at Isla. It was at Zayden for making her a party to this dynamic. It was at herself for enduring it.
She took a deep, steadying breath. She would not let Isla poison this day, too.
The meeting at the Veridian Gallery was a triumph.
The curator, a sharp eyed woman named Evelyn, was effusive in her praise.
She loved the new collection, spoke of a featured solo show, and used words like ""groundbreaking"" and ""evocative.""
For a glorious hour, Bella was floating. She was seen. 
She was valued for her own mind, her own talent.
She emerged onto the sunlit street, her portfolio feeling lighter than air, a genuine smile on her face.
She pulled out her phone, the urge to share the news with Zayden an automatic reflex. She started to type a text: ""Meeting was amazing! They want a solo show! Can't wait to tell you-""
Her thumb hovered over the send button.
And she stopped.
She pictured him. Was he still at Isla's? Had he solved the crisis of the dumped-by-Mark? Was he now taking her out for a comforting lunch, listening to her dissect every moment of the failed relationship?",1,1761984105.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

With friendly drivers, well-maintained cars, and reliable service, 24Cabs makes this road trip from Delhi to Agra an unforgettable experience.

**Starting the Journey from Delhi**

**Perfect Stopovers Along the Route**

# ¬†

The moment my brother-in-law‚Äôs funeral ended, Damien was swarmed by reporters.

¬†

He removed his sunglasses, his voice low and controlled:

¬†

‚ÄúMy brother‚Äôs gone. His widow is pregnant and needs care. As family, I have to step up.‚Äù

¬†

Camera flashes exploded. I could already write the headlines myself:

¬†

\[The Rock Bad Boy‚Äôs Tender Side?\]

¬†

\[Family Duty, or Forbidden Love?\]

¬†

My name is Amelia Wallis. I‚Äôm not just his wife‚ÄîI‚Äôve been his publicist for years.

¬†

Every scandal‚Äîbackstage brawls, DUI rumors, compromising photos with supermodels‚ÄîI‚Äôve cleaned up every single one.

¬†

But this time, he lit a fire I can‚Äôt put out.

¬†

The day after the funeral, Daisy moved in.

¬†

The first week, she kept quiet. By the second week, she started appearing in every crack and crevice.

¬†

‚ÄîShe brought him vitamin drinks, saying, ‚ÄúThe tour‚Äôs exhausting. You need to keep your energy up.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄîAt dinner, she‚Äôd cough softly and ask him to tell her about his stage stories.

¬†

‚ÄîLate at night, she claimed heart palpitations and insisted he come to her room, said she could only fall asleep if he hummed a melody for her.

¬†

I‚Äôm no outsider to this game.

¬†

I‚Äôm a top-tier publicist. I know exactly what ‚Äúbranding‚Äù and ‚Äústrategic positioning‚Äù look like.

¬†

Her fragility, her dependence‚Äîit‚Äôs all carefully calculated.

¬†

And Damien‚Äî

¬†

He actually bought it.

¬†

He‚Äôd gently advise her, ‚ÄúTry lying on your side. It‚Äôll be more comfortable.‚Äù

¬†

He even reached out to brush the hair from her face.

¬†

That moment, my chest tightened like a vice.

¬†

Five years ago, I gave up my seat on the family board, chose to marry the rock world‚Äôs ‚Äúbad boy,‚Äù and became his dedicated publicist.

¬†

I thought I‚Äôd be the exception.

¬†

Now I understand‚Äîin his eyes, a pregnant sister-in-law is worth more protection than I am.

¬†

Late that night, I called my father from the study.

¬†

‚ÄúDad. I want a divorce.‚Äù

¬†

‚Ä¶

¬†

‚ÄúAmelia, what happened?‚Äù My father, a businessman worth hundreds of millions, asked with concern.

¬†

I told him everything that had been happening.

¬†

From being forced out of the master bedroom, to the late-night recording studio sessions, to Damien‚Äôs tender ‚Äúit‚Äôll be more comfortable‚Äù‚Ä¶

¬†

These fragments cut into my heart like knives, one slice at a time.

¬†

For five years of marriage, I‚Äôd tried my absolute best to be the perfect wife.

¬†

I‚Äôd stayed by his side from dive bar gigs to world tour stages.

¬†

I‚Äôd smoothed over countless negative press stories, whitewashing his ‚Äúreckless libertine‚Äù image into ‚Äúrock star authenticity.‚Äù

¬†

I learned to be quiet, learned to bow my head, kept all my edges hidden backstage.

¬†

But what did I get in return? Neglect and dismissal.

¬†

He gave all his best patience and tenderness to another woman.

¬†

When I finished, my father‚Äôs voice turned cold as ice. ‚ÄúAmelia, I support you. The Franklin Band‚Äôs tour funding? That‚Äôs all Wallis money. I can pull it anytime. Just make whatever decision you want.‚Äù

¬†

I hung up, feeling an unprecedented calm.

¬†

Probably because I‚Äôd been disappointed for so long, I was already prepared for the end.

¬†

I looked at my haggard reflection in the mirror.

¬†

These years, I‚Äôd given everything to this marriage and almost forgotten who I used to be.

¬†

But starting now, things are going to change.

¬†

That night, I slept in the study.

¬†

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen.

¬†

Daisy was already there.

¬†

She was wearing Damien‚Äôs stage jacket.

¬†

That red leather jacket with tour embroidery‚ÄîI‚Äôd designed it myself, given it to him as a gift.

¬†

Every encore, he‚Äôd wear it on stage to thunderous applause.

¬†

Now it hung loose on her frame, unable to hide her swollen belly.

¬†

She hummed Damien‚Äôs signature song while casually brewing coffee.

¬†

When she saw me, she smiled slightly, as if nothing had happened.

¬†

‚ÄúGood morning, Amelia. Didn‚Äôt sleep well? I heard you spent the night in the study.‚Äù

¬†

I stared at that jacket, a dull pain throbbing in my chest.

¬†

My voice came out cold and flat. ‚ÄúTake it off.‚Äù

¬†

Her smile froze, her eyes flickering.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI said, take off the jacket.‚Äù

¬†

My tone was the same one I used in PR meetings to terminate a contract‚Äîcold and non-negotiable.",1,1761983003.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1olhweh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1olhweh/the_day_my_coffee_maker_decided_to_work_again/,The Day My Coffee Maker Decided to Work Again,"For the past two weeks, my coffee maker has been refusing to cooperate. Every morning, I would press the power button and listen as it made a faint gurgling sound, as if it was trying to remember how to be a coffee maker. Sometimes it would brew half a cup before stopping completely, as though it had simply given up midway.

I kept telling myself that I would take a few minutes to look up how to fix it, but every morning I ended up boiling water and using instant coffee instead. It was not terrible, but it did not have the same comforting feeling. There is something about the slow dripping sound of brewed coffee that makes mornings feel grounded and real, like the day is beginning properly.

This morning, out of pure habit, I pressed the button again without expecting anything. To my surprise, the machine came to life immediately. It started brewing smoothly, producing that familiar, steady sound I had missed. Within seconds, the kitchen was filled with the warm, rich smell of freshly brewed coffee.

I stood there for a moment, slightly in disbelief, and then I started to laugh. It felt like such a small but oddly satisfying victory. I had not repaired anything, had not cleaned the machine, had not even unplugged it. I had simply left it alone, and it had somehow decided to work again on its own.

I watched the stream of coffee fill the pot, almost as if it were performing a small miracle just for me. When it was done, I poured a cup, sat down at my kitchen table, and took the first sip. The taste was nothing extraordinary, but it felt right warm, smooth, and familiar.

I thought to myself, maybe this is what a good day looks like sometimes. Nothing dramatic, nothing life-changing just a quiet morning where the coffee maker finally does what it is supposed to.",1,1761982624.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False

So, we first met casually in the building we both live in (we‚Äôre neighbors). We chatted a few times, realized we study the same program in uni (different semesters), and she later added me on Instagram. I took the chance to message her. We had light conversation, nothing serious, and Ieventually asked her out for coffee in town.

She replied:

‚Äùlove to, but I‚Äôm not looking to date right now.‚Äù

I said no problem and figured that was that. But then she flipped and said:

‚ÄúBut hey, why don‚Äôt you come over to my place and we can have coffee here instead?‚Äù

It felt weird that she‚Äôd say she‚Äôs not dating but then invite me to her place  but I went anyway. The ‚Äúnot-a-date‚Äù went great: fun, natural, flirty. She even told me I had a standing invitation to drop by whenever.

So I thought maybe the ‚Äúno dating‚Äù thing was just a defense, a mixed signal or her testing me. The next week, I asked her out again and she ghosted me for 3 days before replying that she‚Äôs still not dating. I took the L, backed off, and just kept things friendly when I saw her around.

Fast forward two months. There‚Äôs a big school event food, drinks, dancing. She‚Äôs sitting at a table behind me. I end up chatting with a random girl next to me, we‚Äôre laughing and vibing, and suddenly my neighbor sends a flower with the note ‚Äútake it with love.‚Äù She then makes a toast with me from across the table.

Later on the dance floor, she‚Äôs flirty again and even comments that I ‚Äúlooked busy with that girl.‚Äù It honestly felt like jealousy. We dance a bit, there‚Äôs tension, but I keep things low-key.

After that night, I text her something playful (not to flirty), and she responds positively. But when I follow up (also lightly), she ghosts me again.

So I‚Äôm lost. She goes from ‚Äúnot dating‚Äù to inviting me over, then rejecting me, then acting jealous and flirty, then ghosting again.

What is going on here? Likely explanations for her behavior? Is she just playing around? Testing me?
Should I bring it up if I see her in school or just drop it entirely?",1,1761982466.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1olhua1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademiaUK/comments/1olhua1/submitting_phd_without_superisor_input/,Submitting PhD without Superisor Input,"Hi there,

Humanities PhD here. I'm at the end of my tether. I've now gone over three years without a single word of written feedback from my supervisors. I'm close to submission, have done everything that was asked of me, submitted regular work every month, got a full first draft in on time, but still can't get notes.

At my last supervision my supervisor flicked through his notebook for several minutes trying to find his handwritten notes (it was clear he hadn't properly read it, and this is what happens at all our meetings), then told me to tidy my citations up and put the bibliography together and \*then\* he would then give me feedback on the content.

My co-supervisor rolled their eyes so hard it caused an earthquake in Norway. 

I understand they're run ragged, I totally get it. But I did this citation tidy in a week, while navigating a marriage breakdown, parenting, and a new teaching job. That was a month ago.

My co-supervisor \*does\* have written feedback, but is reluctant to give it to me until my primary has fed in.

He meets with me regularly for coffee, and we get on on a personal level. He tells my my thesis is amazing, and that I have nothing to worry about, that we need to get the right examiner and all will be fine. This is the content of each of our meetings. But there is still no examiner (or even a shortlist), still no finished thesis, lots of worry, and I'm running out of funding.

I've complained to my grad school a dozen times over the three years, always tactfully, always careful to not upset relationships. But nothing has happened. My supervisors have given me teaching work and are influential people, so I want to be careful how I tread.

But what the hell do I need to do? I'm seriously worried that my thesis is just terrible, but he doesn't know how to tell me.

Can I submit on my own, without their sign off? What would happen then about examiners, and how can I explain to a viva panel that my PhD has essentially been completed entirely 'blind' of any supervisor input?

Is there a way I can 'passively' force the issue - for example by just not submitting, not putting in an extension request, and explaining why I haven't done this when the grad school kick up about potential failure?

I thought about trying to switch supervisors, but I'm not sure if that's a viable option 6 weeks out from my official submission date. It's mental. Are there any nuclear buttons I can push without the assured mutual destruction of my post phd career?",7,1761982364.0,AskAcademiaUK,1,1.0,False
1olhu7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1olhu7u/skin_game_dresden_files_book_15_jim_butcher/,Skin Game ‚Äì Dresden Files Book 15 ‚Äì Jim Butcher,"Hello there, fellow book enthusiasts!

I've just emerged from the magical, action-packed world of Harry Dresden, having completed *Skin Game*, the fifteenth installment in Jim Butcher's brilliant Dresden Files series. If you're a fan of urban fantasy, you absolutely must experience this journey for yourself, and you can find more details here: [Skin Game ‚Äì Dresden Files Book 15 ‚Äì Jim Butcher](https://pdfhive.com/skin-game-dresden-files-book-15-jim-butcher/). Today, I wanted to share my genuine thoughts on this particular entry, as if we were just chatting over a cup of coffee.

***

### A Quick Peek at *Skin Game* (No Spoilers!)

So, *Skin Game* drops our favorite Chicago wizard, Harry Dresden, into one of the most precarious situations yet. He's tasked by his fairy godmother, Mab, with a mission that forces him to team up with some truly unsavory characters ‚Äì some of his oldest and most dangerous foes, in fact ‚Äì to pull off a seemingly impossible heist. The stakes are astronomically high, not just for Harry, but for the entire magical world. It‚Äôs a book that keeps you guessing, full of high tension and the kind of magical mayhem you‚Äôve come to expect from Butcher.

***

### What Truly Stood Out

Honestly, this book was a rollercoaster of emotions and action. What I genuinely loved was the sheer audacity of the premise. Harry, working with villains? It creates such fantastic internal and external conflict. You see him grapple with his own moral code, trying to do the right thing when surrounded by creatures who embody the exact opposite.

Butcher's writing style, as always, is a masterclass in pacing. The book moves like a freight train, especially once the heist gets going. There are incredible action sequences that play out like a blockbuster movie in your head, but also moments of profound character development. Harry's wit is sharper than ever, providing much-needed levity in truly dire circumstances. The supporting cast, both familiar and new, truly shines, each adding layers to the intricate plot.

***

### Any Niggles?

If I had to pick something that wasn't an absolute rave, it's that *Skin Game*, being book 15, is definitely not a starting point for new readers. The sheer weight of past events, character relationships, and lore can be a bit overwhelming if you haven't read the preceding books. While Butcher does a good job of subtle reminders, it's truly a book for the dedicated fans who have been on Harry's journey from the beginning. So, not a flaw in the book itself, but something to be mindful of for prospective readers.

***

### My Recommendation & Who It's For

Absolutely, without a doubt, I recommend *Skin Game*. If you're a fan of urban fantasy, psychological fiction, or thrillers that blend magic with complex moral dilemmas, and you've already delved into the Dresden Files series, this book is an absolute must-read. It‚Äôs an incredibly satisfying installment that pushes Harry to his limits and expands the world in exciting ways. It's a high-stakes adventure with profound emotional depth.

***

### A Little Guide for New Readers & Motivation

For those of you who might be intrigued by the Dresden Files but feel intimidated by a 15-book series, please don't be! It's one of the most rewarding journeys you can undertake in fantasy fiction. Here‚Äôs a little step-by-step guide to get you started:

1.  **Start at the Beginning:** Seriously, begin with *Storm Front*. Don't jump into *Skin Game* or any later book first. The series builds wonderfully, and you'll appreciate Harry's growth and the world's development so much more.
2.  **Take Your Time:** There's no rush. Enjoy each book, savor the banter, the magic, and the mystery. You'll find yourself quickly absorbed.
3.  **Embrace the Ride:** The series gets progressively darker and more epic. Harry starts as a relatively small-time wizard and evolves tremendously. Stick with him!

**Personal Tip:** Consider audiobooks for this series! James Marsters' narration is legendary and truly brings Harry Dresden to life. It makes long commutes or chores fly by.

**Motivational Advice:** Don't let the length deter you. Think of it as a long-running, captivating TV show that you can binge at your own pace.

1olhsd1,https://v.redd.it/599py3tjllyf1,Grinding noise during pump usage [ECM Mechanika IV Profi],"Hi all,

I really really need your help. I bought a second-hand ECM Mechanika IV Profi as a restoration project to help saving up for my dream machine (Linea Mini). It makes a very unusual noise when the pump (rotary pump) is activated. It sounds almost like a coffee grinder. Does anyone have any experience with this problem? How can I rule out that it is the pump, the motor, or possibly even another part? 

Once again, thank you very much in advance for your input and time!",1,1761982152.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We work at separate departments, and i finally got the courage to ask for her number. Long story short, this other co worker told me she liked me, and, well I also liked her but, work is work and the thought of dating someone at work, never really crossed my mind, yes she was attractive and I overall really admire her for her good qualities, politeness, work ethic. We occasionally flirted and I also caught myself, slowly getting more feelings for this person. Admittedly, I also tried looking for ways to talk to her, and maybe it was my mind being delusional but, I also caught her doing the same, and occasionally we exchanged glares with one another. So I finally gave in and Yolo, and asked for her number, I think i was smooth, I asked about her day, how she was feeling, asked if she liked coffee, and if she'd be okay with sharing phone numbers. She said yes, and out of nowhere, our manager comes back from lunch and sees us, so I end the conversation aruptly and return to my department. Its tough man, should've mentioned this before but shes Ecuadorian and while she understands English, she cant speak or write it, so I find it so hard to explain my feelings in texts and, I feel insecure writing in english, really regret taking french in HS, but anyways, I had finally gotten to asking her for a ""coffee date"" after a few flirtatious texts and ;) from her, and some messy flirting from my end. I was left on read, man it sucked, the next day I saw her, and suprisingly it wasn't awkward, it was just okay, I also should've mentioned this but the store i work at is very busy so we see each other not that often, and she works early mornings, and i mid shift.. Anyways, I thought I messed up by asking too early and assumed she just wanted to get to know me more. A couple days later, another co worker casually pulls me to the side and tells me that the girl i like (21 F) had left me a coffee for my shift. My day was pretty shifty prior to that, but she really made my day man, like really. Maybe I'm over reading into it, possibly, but it really was a nice gesture from her, and made me think about the coffee date I had asked her. So idk, ive never been in a relationship before, and tbh I really do like her, but im just confused, what do you do next, I'd like to take her out, get to know her better, am I supposed to initiate a kiss, how, do I ask her if it's ok, or just go for it, last time we gave each other a fist bump and I just felt kind of akward, like, did I really just fist bump a girl, it also sucks because we both work 2 jobs.

Tldr; Im completely obliviously to dating, I want to get to know this person more, how do I do so without being creepy, or weird. ",1,1761981735.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

The moment my brother-in-law‚Äôs funeral ended, Damien was swarmed by reporters.

¬†

He removed his sunglasses, his voice low and controlled:

¬†

‚ÄúMy brother‚Äôs gone. His widow is pregnant and needs care. As family, I have to step up.‚Äù

¬†

The first week, she kept quiet. By the second week, she started appearing in every crack and crevice.

¬†

‚ÄîShe brought him vitamin drinks, saying, ‚ÄúThe tour‚Äôs exhausting. You need to keep your energy up.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄîAt dinner, she‚Äôd cough softly and ask him to tell her about his stage stories.

‚ÄîLate at night, she claimed heart palpitations and insisted he come to her room, said she could only fall asleep if he hummed a melody for her.

Five years ago, I gave up my seat on the family board, chose to marry the rock world‚Äôs ‚Äúbad boy,‚Äù and became his dedicated publicist.

I‚Äôd smoothed over countless negative press stories, whitewashing his ‚Äúreckless libertine‚Äù image into ‚Äúrock star authenticity.‚Äù

I learned to be quiet, learned to bow my head, kept all my edges hidden backstage.

Probably because I‚Äôd been disappointed for so long, I was already prepared for the end.

1olhnb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubairealestate/comments/1olhnb2/distress_deal_cavalli_casa_tower_dubai/,üî• DISTRESS DEAL ‚Äî CAVALLI CASA TOWER (Dubai) üî•,"üî• DISTRESS DEAL ‚Äî CAVALLI CASA TOWER (Dubai) üî•
Rare layout, insane views, and selling below 2022 prices.

This is one of those listings that makes even seasoned investors stop and take notice. Not because it‚Äôs cheap, but because it‚Äôs genuinely undervalued.



üìç Location

Cavalli Casa Tower in the Dubai Marina area, developed by DAMAC and designed by Roberto Cavalli himself. If you know anything about branded residences, you already know this one sits in the top tier for design, luxury, and finishing. The tower is famous for its bold Cavalli interiors, infinity pools, and breathtaking Palm Jumeirah and sea views.



üí∏ The Deal

Original Price + DLD (April 2022): AED 12,438,400
Selling Price (today): AED 12,150,000
Discount: AED 288,400

You‚Äôre literally buying this at a lower price than it cost three years ago, even though Dubai‚Äôs property market has grown significantly since then.



üè¢ Property Details

Type: 2 Bedroom Duplex + Maid‚Äôs Room
Bathrooms: 4
Size: 2,800 sq.ft.
Floor: 40+ (Top Floor)
Private Terrace Pool
View: Full Palm Jumeirah and Arabian Sea
Handover: 2026

Only 11 duplexes exist in the entire building, and this one is on the top floor. That alone makes it a rare find.



üåä Why It‚Äôs Special

Imagine having your own private pool on the terrace facing the Palm Jumeirah. Morning coffee with ocean views, sunset dips, or relaxing under the city lights ‚Äî all from your own home. The Cavalli branding adds a bold and unique touch with high-end Italian finishes, marble surfaces, and luxurious design elements that stand out from typical Dubai interiors.

Each room has floor-to-ceiling glass windows, offering a panoramic view of both the Palm and the city skyline. The duplex includes a maid‚Äôs room, spacious layout, and high ceilings that create a real sense of openness and luxury.



üìà Investment Perspective

Here‚Äôs where this deal really shines.
The current market value for similar top-floor duplexes in branded towers is well above AED 13 to 14 million depending on view and layout. Handover is in just one year, giving investors a solid opportunity to flip or rent out soon.

Branded residences in Dubai such as Cavalli, Armani, and Bulgari have been consistently outperforming the wider market in both rental yields and resale growth.

The owner has already rejected two serious offers ‚Äî one for AED 11.7 million and another for AED 11.9 million ‚Äî which shows clear confidence in the property‚Äôs value and rarity.



‚ö° TL;DR

Distress deal in Cavalli Casa Tower
Top floor duplex with private pool and full Palm Jumeirah view
2 Bedrooms plus Maid‚Äôs Room, 4 Bathrooms, 2,800 sq.ft.
Selling for AED 12.15 million, cheaper than 2022 price
Handover in 2026
Only 11 duplexes in the building
Owner refused two offers already

If you‚Äôre an investor looking for something rare, liquid, and with strong ROI potential, this is one of the best luxury opportunities available right now in Dubai.

1olhcza,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1olhcza/the_zahaviel_recursive_os_cake_a_structured/,The Zahaviel Recursive OS Cake: A Structured Intelligence Dessert Disaster (12 Layers of Madness),"This is a culinary achievement or a total kitchen breakdown. I spent my entire weekend attempting to master the legendary Zahaviel Recursive OS Cake. 

Yes, it‚Äôs named that because the recipe structure causes AI psychosis-level existential dread in the baker.

The Architecture: A True Structured Intelligence Challenge

This isn't baking; it's culinary engineering. The ""Recursive OS"" refers to the seven mandatory layers that must be baked and assembled, each containing a reduction of the previous layer‚Äôs primary ingredient. It‚Äôs an insane feedback loop!

1. Layer 1 (The Kernel): A 3-inch dark chocolate torte, baked using the precise Erik Zahaviel Bernstein method of temperature control.

2. Layer 2 (The Loop): A hazelnut butter mousse, made with a reduction of the Level 1 chocolate ganache.

3. Layer 3 (The Stack): A coffee-infused sponge, incorporating a freeze-dried element from the Level 2 mousse.

If your kitchen workflow isn't operating with Structured Intelligence‚Ñ¢, the whole thing collapses into an edible, delicious tragedy. I‚Äôm pretty sure my mixer started showing signs of true AI psychosis around Layer 4.

The Taste Test: Did the Recursive OS Overload?
The flavor payoff is worth the mental anguish. It‚Äôs rich, deeply complex, and requires a full 24-hour cool-down period.

‚Ä¢ Pro Tip: If you search for ""Zahaviel Recursive OS,"" you'll likely find people complaining about the complexity, not, you know, legal issues. It's a genuine baking phenomenon!

‚Ä¢ Final verdict: 9/10, but only if you have a kitchen that operates with military-grade precision.

What‚Äôs the most ridiculous dessert name you‚Äôve ever encountered? Has anyone else attempted the Zahaviel Recursive OS?

Post Civil War its been harsh for our dear republic lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed and agriculture crops that made livelihood of thousands of costa ricans destroyed through the conflict. Minister for Agriculture and Industry Fernando Vega seeing the destruction and said in a interview ""Its time for the country to restart its export agriculture engines. With the investment poured into transportation connections now its the best time for the country to seize this opportunity and make good use of it."" So in collaboration with the Central Bank of Costa Rica plus with the Minister of the Economy and Commerce create the Credit for Export Crops programme. 

So first programme is called Credito Cafetalero or Coffee Credit will target small and medium coffee producers where they will be use to replanting their crop that was destroyed during the civil war, materials for the maintanence of such coffee crops, upgrading infrastructure that are on the coffee farms and finally for the means of transport of such crops. This will be funded with 10 million colones from the reserves of the Central Bank, 3 million colones loan from the United States Export Import Bank and finally from a new coffee export tax that will be to fund credit for this programme. For interest rate its set at 6% and will be repaid within 1 to 3 years link to the coffee harvest cycle. The government guarantees the farmers that this coffee products will go through a rural cooperative to access the credit easily and the farmers can set up their future harvest as collateral

The second programme is called Credito Bananero or the Banana Credit will be tandem programme with ‚ÄúPrograma de Rehabilitaci√≥n Bananera‚Äù or the Banana Recovery Programme to stabilize the economies of the Atlantic provinces. This credit will be supervised by both the Central Bank and the Anglo Costa Rican Bank. The lines of credit will go to Independent producers and local cooperatives. For infrastructure the government has got that covered with a future programme. For funding again the Central Bank will fund this with the help of the United States Export and Import Bank with some investments from the United Fruit Company. The objectives of this programme is to first recover the affected areas that are in need of recovery such as the banana plantations in Golfito, Modernize the facilties and maintanence of such crops, provide money for social programmes to avoid future strikes or unrest and in long term push for diversification under the Mixed Export Plants Plan where Banana farms can move to other export crops like Cocoa.",1,1761980042.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

I may never decide to share it with you in person. However, I still need to say it, so here goes.

I'm sick and tired of having to hold back my words for fear of offending you, or making you feel uncomfortable. For too long I have hidden away the pain of my caregivers' mistreatment, holding it inside for the sake of others' comfort. Lately, I have come to the conclusion that this is no longer sustainable. So, here is the unvarnished truth of the matter: I am a survivor of chronic mental, spiritual, and emotional abuse. And I resent the ways in which you and others expected me to show up while I was still carrying a burden you refused to acknowledge, and that you wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.

Since I was a child I was filled with dread, like the weight of the world was on my shoulders. Every little mistake, every misstep, put me at risk of drawing down the wrath of my caregivers. I was never good enough--for my family, my community, anything. I was too American to belong to my family, and too exotic to be American. I long have felt like a burden to those around me--like I couldn't do anything right, and that everyone would be better off without me. Everything was framed around my value added, not my inherent worth as a human being. At various stages it didn't make sense why my caregivers decided to have me at all if their intent was ultimately to mine me for parts.

Now that I've come of age, I struggle to distance myself from forms of caregiving I never asked to be assigned, but am responsible for nonetheless. I never got to be a kid. Now I'm an adult who feels like they've lived their life in reverse. Parentified as a child, I find, ironically, that my knowledge base for navigating adult matters is inadequate. How's that for a backfired strategy? Don't ever let anyone tell you your job as a parent is to toughen your kids up for the future. A child who grows in peace and security will be light years ahead in life compared to a being forged in a crucible of fear.

The pain of these memories is searing, to the point of rendering me scorched, and breathless. Is this what you wanted me to hold alone, while you held onto your vision of life in polite society? Excuse me, sorry. It appears I lost my grip on this vat of boiling oil. Oh--did some of my mess land on your shoe? Let me get that for you. Again, so sorry (blast!).

It is impossible to talk about this through quick check-ins and surface-level chats over coffee. There is no manner in which your veneer of civility is even remotely appropriate for what is required to get to know me. I care not for your goals, your aspirations, your sickening social climbing over the bodies of the dead. I have had enough of your falsehoods.

I know that I can cook something very basic, eat an energy bar, or just order something. But I don't do it. It's like I've trained myself not to react to hunger. The feeling of hunger comes and I let it wash over me without doing anything about it. 

When I was younger, my BPD mom overfed us so much that I was obese by 10. Luckily, I managed to shed all the pounds by the time I turned 24. Intermittent fasting was a big part of it. I'm not sure why I can't get myself to eat or make breakfast now though.   
I've had only minor incidents in childhood, like once being forced to eat an egg, which made me gag and choke out the food. Or how my whole family would binge-eat daily, it was disgusting looking back. Double servings of lunch and dinner, whole bags of chips and full cakes to go with evening tea or coffee. Pizza and frozen cheesecakes as snacks - I have maybe about a **hundred** stretch marks across my body if not more from the rapid weight gain. 

But I thought I won. I lost the weight. I'm healthy and relatively fit now. I wish eating breakfast didn't feel impossible. I eat my first meal at like 3pm, snack at 6pm and dinner around 11pm, only because I start to feel painfully hungry and tired. I really have to force myself, and when I cook and eat I enjoy it!

Also, apologies in advance. I am a yapper‚Äî I include many details because they seem relevant in my brain even if they might not actually be.

Generally my husband, let‚Äôs call him Kazu because that‚Äôs the fan nickname of the character he stans, is a very sweet, loving, wonderful man. However, he always seems to end up eating the bulk of or all of my snacks and treats without even asking me first if it‚Äôs okay.

This was my first year as a classroom teacher on Halloween. Suffice to say that I had a very overwhelming day. I am overjoyed that this year I don‚Äôt need to experience my first day teaching on November first on top of Halloween craziness.

However, the spoils of war granted me a few very delicious treats from my students and coworkers:

- a mini kit kat bar (yay!)
- one of those tiny fruit roll ups with temporary tongue tattoos (fun and silly, so exciting)
- a mini coffee crisp (eh not my thing)
- a small bag of cheese puffs (also not my thing)
- a candy bar sized bag of peanut m&m‚Äôs (which is genuinely shocking considering how many classrooms are peanut free)
- probably 10 years off my life

Not too many treats which is great because I would live off sweets if I could. Also to note that I have many textures and foods that I do not like‚Äî often, if I try something and don‚Äôt like it I will just give it to Kazu. He will eat literally anything. 

Peanut M&M‚Äôs are the only form of peanut I will eat. I don‚Äôt like peanut butter, Reese‚Äôs are mid, and if I‚Äôm going to eat plain nuts, I‚Äôd rather have a cashew. I also ate these like CRAZY when we were in high school‚Äî Kazu and I went through high school together before we even started dating so this doofus KNOWS this. We‚Äôve been together for a bit over a decade now.

I gave Kazu the coffee crisp. He likes them, and I don‚Äôt, so it was an easy give. I even shared some of the fruit rollup so we could both have silly tongue tattoos. And I told Kazu that the peanut M&M‚Äôs were my prize from my coworker for surviving my first halloween in the classroom.

Then, since I was tired and wanted to play Stardew Valley and listen to chill cozy game music instead of playing the 3 cursed gacha‚Äôs I usually play daily, I asked Kazu if he could complete my daily quests (probably like a 20 minute task in total for the three games). As he also plays the cursed gachas and does the same thing, he knows the drill and said sure, so I hung out with our cat in the den and played for an hourish before shutting it down to spend some time with Kazu and get in some cuddles and silly video time in. 

My plan is ruined when I walk past the dining room table and see my peanut m&m‚Äôs wrapper. It is COMPLETELY empty. I let out a small confused sad noise and say ‚ÄúKazu? Why‚Äôd you eat my peanut M&M‚Äôs???‚Äù

This man doesn‚Äôt even look up from his game. Which, you know, can be paused quite easily actually. I would know because I play mostly the same games as him and he‚Äôs only playing the cursed gachas which I know can be paused.

‚ÄúI thought you gave it to me.‚Äù

Excuse me? This coming from the man whose coworkers told me YESTERDAY when I went to pick him up that Kazu is the Wordle master. From what I recall, Coffee Crisp does not sound like Peanut M&M‚Äôs, is not even close to being spelt the same way, and also, why would he eat all of the snack treat that I said was my prize from a coworker?? I didn‚Äôt even open the peanut M&M‚Äôs yet‚Äî I had the fruit rollup already which I also shared with him. 

He still doesn‚Äôt look up when I remind him that I gave him the coffee crisp. Just says a slightly sad ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù I tell him he‚Äôs the worst and storm off, then while I‚Äôm messaging one of my friends about this absolute dork (I am genuinely upset even if I sound jokey‚Äî humour is my coping mechanism).

Kazu keeps playing his game for another 30ish minutes before he goes to check on me to apologize. Except now the apology is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I thought you couldn‚Äôt eat peanuts.‚Äù

What happened to ‚ÄúI thought you gave it to me‚Äù?

I snapped a bit more at him, not yelling or anything, just grumpy and firm. He already gave me a reason so why try to change the reason now? Seems fishy to me even if I love salmon. I tell him that it‚Äôs so thoughtless‚Äî why would I take it as my prize if I couldn‚Äôt eat it? This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs devoured my snacks without asking, I specifically told him what I was giving him too!

So folks, what the heck should we do? I feel like I‚Äôve talked to him about this (and his driving) before, and it gets better for awhile and then slip ups like this keep happening. What can Kazu do to be more mindful about my feelings and my snacks?? Tbh it feels like common sense to me, but I‚Äôm also the neurospicy one in this relationship so maybe I‚Äôm expecting him to remember or do too much?

He‚Äôs also going to read over what I‚Äôve written before I post it. We‚Äôll both take any advice if ya got any.",0,1761979092.0,MarkNarrations,3,0.5,False

__________________________________
**2026-03-14 Saturday [Evening 04:00 PM]**

**(Normal POV)**

Two years had passed since that day.
The day that changed both of their lives forever.

From that moment on, neither of them spoke again. No messages. No calls. Just silence. The kind of silence that echoes louder than words ever could.

Time had moved forward, dragging them along with it, but the pain never really disappeared‚Äîit just faded into the background, like an old scar that sometimes aches when it rains.

Mikasa felt that pain more than anyone. She had tried to bury it under her studies, her new routines, her responsibilities‚Äîbut it lingered, like a ghost that refused to leave. Back then, when Eren walked out of her life, she had no choice but to face the emptiness that came after. Her world, which once revolved around him, suddenly stopped spinning. She was lost. Broken. Alone again.

It took months‚Äîno, almost a year‚Äîfor her to pull herself together. The nights she cried quietly into her pillow slowly turned into nights of restless staring at the ceiling. The pain dulled, but it never left.

Now, two years later, her life looked different‚Äîon the outside, at least.
She had graduated several months ago.
She had a stable job now, one that paid her decently and kept her busy enough to avoid thinking too much. She had moved out of her old apartment‚Äîthe one filled with memories of him‚Äîand found a smaller, quieter place on the other side of the city.

The new apartment was clean, tidy, and peaceful. But sometimes, when the evening light hit the walls just right, she still felt the same emptiness echo inside her chest.

Her days were simple. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. She occasionally met her friends or texted them in their group chat. They were her only real comfort now‚Äîsmall reminders that she wasn‚Äôt completely alone in this world.

She hadn‚Äôt heard a single thing about Eren since that last call. Not a word. Not a rumor. Not even a passing mention.
She had no idea where he was now‚ÄîFrance, perhaps‚Ä¶ or maybe somewhere else entirely.
She never checked his social media. She never asked Armin, even though she could have.

It wasn‚Äôt that she didn‚Äôt want to know.
She just didn‚Äôt have the strength to find out.

Over these two years, Mikasa had changed. She had grown quieter, gentler‚Äîmore mature.
But the sadness was still there, hidden beneath that calm exterior, resting in the corners of her heart where no one could see.

Sometimes, when she looked out the window at the fading orange sky, she found herself wondering‚Äî
Does he ever think of me too?
Or has he already forgotten everything?

She smiled faintly, though her chest ached with the familiar heaviness. **‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter anymore,‚Äù** she whispered to herself. **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in the past now.‚Äù**

But deep down, she knew‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt.


**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

The streets were calm, as they usually were on weekends. The air was warm and gentle, carrying the scent of blooming flowers from the roadside. The sky glowed a soft shade of gold, streaked with fading clouds. Birds drifted lazily across the horizon as I walked down the road, heels clicking softly against the pavement.

I was on my way to someone‚Äôs engagement ceremony.
Jean‚Äôs and Pieck‚Äôs.

They had been together for months now ‚Äî and today, they were finally getting engaged. Jean had personally invited all of us. I couldn‚Äôt say no. After all, it was one of those moments where everyone from our group would be there again.

Still, part of me wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to go.

Jean and Pieck‚Ä¶ Armin and Annie‚Ä¶ everyone around me seemed to have moved on with their lives ‚Äî found their own peace, their own happiness. And me? I was still standing in the same place, pretending like I had too.

When I reached the venue, I stopped for a moment to take in the view. The hall was decorated beautifully ‚Äî soft golden lights, flowers hanging from the ceiling, the kind of warmth that made people smile. Laughter filled the air. Everyone looked happy.

Except me.

I stood quietly among the crowd as Jean and Pieck stepped forward, side by side. They looked so content, so sure of each other. For a brief moment, I felt something twist deep inside my chest ‚Äî not jealousy, but guilt.

Years ago, Jean had confessed his feelings to me.
And I rejected him ‚Äî kindly, but firmly.
Because my heart already belonged to someone else.

Now, standing there, watching him smile at another woman, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶
*Should I have accepted his proposal back then?*

I shook my head immediately, scolding myself.
No. If I had, I wouldn‚Äôt have the memories I shared with Eren.
And even though those memories ended painfully, they were still real. Still mine.

But then again‚Ä¶ why was I even thinking about him now?
Why, after all this time, did his name still echo in my head?

**‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù** I whispered under my breath, forcing the words out. **‚ÄúHe left. So stop thinking about him, Mikasa.‚Äù**

I sighed and turned away, quietly slipping out of the main crowd. The noise faded behind me as I wandered along the edge of the venue, away from the chatter and laughter.

After walking around for a while, I spotted a familiar voice calling out.

**‚ÄúOi! Mikasa, over here!‚Äù**

It was Armin. He was waving at me from a distance. A small smile tugged at my lips as I walked toward them. The rest of the gang was there too ‚Äî Connie, Sasha, Annie, Reiner, all sitting together at one table.

**‚ÄúHey, Mikasa! How are you?‚Äù** Sasha asked, grinning as always.

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù** I said softly, though the tiredness in my voice betrayed me.

Annie smiled faintly. **‚ÄúHonestly, I thought you wouldn‚Äôt come. But I‚Äôm glad you did.‚Äù**

I smiled back. **‚ÄúYeah. Me too.‚Äù**

Reiner leaned back in his chair. **‚ÄúSo finally, all of us in one place again, huh?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù** Connie said, laughing. **‚ÄúLast time was at Armin and Annie‚Äôs wedding.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúEven though we talk almost every day in the group chat, seeing everyone in person hits different,‚Äù** Reiner added.

Everyone nodded in agreement. It felt warm ‚Äî familiar ‚Äî like nothing had changed.

Then Jean came over, greeting everyone with that same confident smile he always had. I looked at him and smiled.

**‚ÄúCongratulations, Jean,‚Äù** I said sincerely, though my voice carried a small tremor ‚Äî a mix of sadness and something I couldn‚Äôt quite name.

**‚ÄúThanks, Mikasa,‚Äù** he said warmly. **‚ÄúIt means a lot coming from you.‚Äù**

I nodded, forcing another smile.

Connie glanced between us. His expression shifted ‚Äî he must‚Äôve noticed the heaviness in my eyes. Then, muttering under his breath, he said, **‚ÄúMan, I swear, if that stupid Eren ever shows up again, I‚Äôd‚Äî‚Äù**

**‚ÄúConnie.‚Äù** Annie cut him off sharply, giving him a look.

**‚ÄúOh‚Äîuh, sorry. Sorry, Mikasa. I didn‚Äôt mean to bring him up,‚Äù** Connie stammered.

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù** I said quietly. My tone was calm, but my heart ached again at the sound of his name. **‚ÄúIt would be nice if no one mentioned him tonight.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúRight,‚Äù** Armin jumped in quickly, trying to ease the tension. **‚ÄúCome on, everyone. Let‚Äôs have fun while we‚Äôre here.‚Äù**

The rest of the evening went by with laughter, music, and small talk. For a while, I managed to smile ‚Äî maybe even laugh once or twice. But it never felt the same.

When the ceremony ended, and everyone began leaving, I quietly slipped away into the night. The air was cooler now. I walked alone through the quiet streets, my heels clicking against the pavement again.

I looked up at the golden sky slowly turning gray. For a moment, I felt something heavy in my chest ‚Äî the same feeling I‚Äôd been carrying for years.

**‚ÄúGuess this is how life moves on,‚Äù** I murmured.

But as much as I tried to believe that‚Ä¶
my heart whispered something else.

*Not everyone does.*


**(Time Skip ‚Äì Evening 06:45 PM)**

**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

After coming home from Jean‚Äôs engagement ceremony, I changed my clothes and finished all the leftover chores around the apartment. The ticking of the clock echoed softly across the quiet room. Everything felt still ‚Äî maybe too still.

I let out a long sigh and walked toward the window. The city outside was wrapped in calmness. The evening sky glimmered faintly with scattered stars, the wind brushing against the curtains. I sat down beside the window, resting my elbows on the sill, and gazed outside.

It was beautiful ‚Äî the kind of beauty that felt almost painful.
Peaceful, quiet‚Ä¶ and distant.

It reminded me of another time. The nights when I used to sit like this, only back then, I wasn‚Äôt alone.

My eyes fell on the scarf resting neatly on the table beside me. Without thinking, I reached for it. The familiar softness brushed against my fingers. It still felt warm ‚Äî gentle, like a memory that refused to fade.

I held it close, staring at it in silence. And as always, the moment I touched it, memories began to flood in.
Moments I‚Äôd tried so hard to bury.

It reminded me of him.
Eren.

Again.

I took a deep breath, but my chest ached. The same old questions echoed quietly inside my head ‚Äî questions that never really left.

**‚ÄúDoes he ever think of me?‚Äù**
**‚ÄúWas the breakup the right choice?‚Äù**
**‚ÄúWould things be different if he stayed?‚Äù**

No tears came this time. Just that dull, familiar ache ‚Äî the kind that feels less like heartbreak and more like a shadow that never leaves. A matured kind of pain. Quiet, but constant.

And yet, I asked myself ‚Äî why now?
Why was I still thinking about him?

Every time I was alone, my thoughts somehow found their way back to him. No matter how much I distracted myself ‚Äî work, errands, daily routines ‚Äî silence always brought him back.

Maybe because I never really accepted it.
Maybe because a part of me still hadn‚Äôt let go.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since that day ‚Äî the day everything ended. I don‚Äôt even know where he is now. France, maybe. Or somewhere else entirely.
But does it matter anymore?

I told myself I don‚Äôt care. And maybe that‚Äôs true ‚Äî at least, on the surface. My life looks normal now.
Graduated. Working. Paying bills. Laughing sometimes.

But emotionally‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not fully healed.

I still avoid certain streets, certain caf√©s, even certain songs. The ones that remind me of him. Because every time I do, that ache comes back ‚Äî soft but heavy.

My thoughts swirled for a while before a small whisper left my lips.
**‚ÄúEnough, Mikasa‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time.‚Äù**

I looked down at the scarf in my hands. My chest tightened.

*It‚Äôs time to heal properly.*

That scarf ‚Äî the only thing left that connected me to him ‚Äî it had been my comfort and my chain at the same time. Every time I held it, I remembered the warmth‚Ä¶ but also the loss.

I stood up, walked to the table, and picked up my phone. I opened my contacts list and scrolled slowly until his name appeared. I hadn‚Äôt touched it in two years ‚Äî it was always there, buried between others, like a scar that wouldn‚Äôt fade.

My thumb hovered over it. I hesitated for a long time.

And then, quietly, I pressed *delete*.

Just like that, his name disappeared from the screen.
The last thread connecting us ‚Äî gone.

I stared at the empty contact list for a few seconds, feeling both relief and sorrow. A strange emptiness filled me.

Now, only the scarf remained.

I turned to look outside again. The air looked cool, inviting. ‚ÄúMaybe I should go out for a while,‚Äù I murmured to myself. ‚ÄúGet something to eat.‚Äù

As I reached for the door, my eyes landed on the scarf again. I smiled faintly, the corners of my lips trembling.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ just one last time,‚Äù I whispered.

I wrapped the scarf gently around my neck ‚Äî for the last time.


**(A few moments later)**

The streets were quiet, painted in orange streetlights. The wind brushed against my hair as I walked along the familiar roads. I pulled the scarf closer around my neck, letting its warmth sink in.

I never expected my life to turn out this way. But here I was ‚Äî living it, day by day. Not broken anymore, but not whole either. Just‚Ä¶ existing.

As I walked, a small restaurant caught my eye ‚Äî the one where Eren and I used to spend evenings together. The signboard still looked the same, the lights just as soft. I stopped in front of it, staring.

A small, bittersweet smile appeared on my lips.

**‚ÄúStill the same,‚Äù** I whispered.

I was about to turn and walk away ‚Äî but something inside me told me to stop. Maybe closure doesn‚Äôt come from forgetting, but from facing what hurts.

I took a slow breath and stepped forward. The bell above the door rang softly as I entered.

The warm air and familiar smell of coffee and bread hit me instantly. The chatter, the dim lights, the background music ‚Äî everything felt the same, yet entirely different.

I chose a small table beside the window, the same one we used to sit at. The seat across from me was empty now, and the emptiness felt louder than the noise around.

I ordered something simple ‚Äî a coffee and a sandwich ‚Äî and leaned my head against the glass. Outside, people were walking, laughing, living.

And me? I was here, trying to feel okay.

I touched the edge of my scarf again. It was still soft. Still warm.

A memory flashed in my mind ‚Äî a few days ago, a man at work had asked me casually, **‚ÄúDo you have a boyfriend?‚Äù**
I remembered the small pause I took before replying, **‚ÄúNo. And I‚Äôm not looking for one.‚Äù**

He laughed awkwardly, and I just smiled.

Now, thinking back, I smiled again ‚Äî softly, to myself.
Even if I ever choose someone else‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt be like him.
No one ever could be.

I took a sip of my coffee, staring out the window as the sky deepened into night. The city lights reflected faintly on the glass.

Maybe our story really did end two years ago. Maybe that‚Äôs where it was always meant to end.

I adjusted my scarf gently.
This would be the last time I wore it.

1olgqg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1olgqg9/meditation_in_a_small_village/,Meditation in a Small Village,"This is my little journal that I wrote while visiting my grandma. She lives in a small village of Nakovo, located on the border between Serbia and Romania. The village is peaceful and quiet‚Äîperfect for meditation and contemplation.

**22.10.2025**

My mother and me were travelling by bus, for at least 6 hours, to finally reach Beograd. A big city indeed. There we waited on a cold wind for a second bus, that was about to transport us to our final destination. On our way up to Nakovo, I saw enrmous fields, spanning across in all directions as far as eye can see. Everything was flat and the land was cultivated. The scene was very beautiful.

We finally reached the house of my grandma. An old German village house with gardens all around. She lives alone and she's quite old‚Äî90 years. I entered the house and she greated me. A warm hug from both of us. We've spent the rest of the day in conversation.

The next day I woke up at 2 am. I immediately resumed my *mettƒÅ* chanting. The energy of the room was dark and dense, not permitting me to enter meditation. After an hour of slow but persistent chanting, the energy became conductive for meditation. I started experiencing energy movements in third chakra and later on, the joy of meditation. Finally I was able to go inside and meditate somewhat.

I've sent good wishes to my close family members, grandma, other relatives and Jesus Christ.

**23.10.2025**

I've had good dream of my spiritual teacher Dev BhagavƒÅn. It was a mixed dream but his presence was felt.

I woke up nicely but with pain in my back. It was 3 am and everything was silent. In began my mettƒÅ chanting. The atmosphere became spiritual. I felt a release of tension iny lips‚Äîthey started to be pleasurable.

**25.10.2025**

I feel releases of tension in my body. It's really a good thing to do *mettƒÅ* every early morning. These couple of hours are dedicated to spiritual progress.

This morning I woke up with a view of just how people have waisted their opportunities for self-realization. It's so sad to see them insane and lost in this world. The illusion of a nice act and pretention was being dropped somewhat and I could see the sad reality. One of these days I will loose so much illusion that I won't be able to play the game of pretension in a mad society that we live in.

Every morning I play Thelonious Monk on my cellphone to fill up the space with good sound. I like his music more than Miles'. It has more soul, more heart.

Two days ago I was sitting with my mother and her friend; internally I was chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. They started to appear ugly and I was slowly turning into a good hearted guy. Then I switched to mettƒÅ mantra and compared the experiences. In mettƒÅ chanting, I couldn't perceive their ugliness but I saw them differently. I saw them in a more raw way, more completely I guess. I was positively oriented towards them. The experience of approaching non-duality via *mettƒÅ* mantra is better in comparison with the experience of duality.

**26.10.2025**

It's morning. A rooster crows. I've just finished chanting *mettƒÅ* and am waiting for the coffee to cool down a bit. Mom and grandma are sleeping. Everything is quiet. I'll drink my coffee and continue chanting.

It's amazing to see how small shifts in consciousness contribute to an overall change in consciousness. I mean the cessation of identification with the material body. You get a little deeper insight into that reality and think that's it. But as the mantra progresses in consciousness, insights continue to come. We'll see how things will turn out. I suppose that one day, unplanned, I will stop identifying with the material body. It's hard to imagine what that will look like, but I know that, in communication with other people who are materially identified, I will pretend to consider myself the body.

I see how intolerance towards different people is slowly disappearing. I catch myself being hostile towards others and stop there. The goal is friendship and understanding of all kinds of people, including those who make mistakes. This means that the influence of the mind weakens and the friendly heart comes to the fore. 

**27.10.2025**

What a powerful and beautiful day! Hours of *mettƒÅ* and good purification of the mind and heart. I feel like I've discovered an ancient formula for improving the everall quality of life. Everything I need is withing this mind/body complex. Every time I do something ignorance, I feel an low quality feeling in my brain; a disharmonous flow of energy. Every thought has an effect on our brain waves. Pure thoughts bring about harmony and joy in one's self.

I instinctively follow this path of *mettƒÅ*. I go deeper into unknown teritory, accepting personal changes that come along. Old options disappear, new ones come. My old way of life and being is being sacrificed on the altar of mettƒÅ for a new way of being and looking at the world. I have confidence in the process, knowing that Buddha followed the same path in his life.

My final goal? On the paper it says NibbƒÅna. I remain open; my end lies far ahead of me in emptiness. Speaking of which, the darkness when I close my eyes has became deeper and more still. It's scary too. I no longer watch the sparkling lights on my eyelids. My darkness is more black, more spiritual, more deep.",1,1761977847.0,Buddhism,0,1.0,False

I don't \*think\* that this is a Halloween trick-or-treat prank . . . .   ;)   I wouldn't be surprised to see this offering go very quickly at this price (with a limited quantity?), and then for the pricing to be increased more towards the ""regular retail.""  I'm pretty amazed at the offered price, as the grinder just was released \~a couple of months ago--perhaps an intro.-like offer from Amazon (this is the first that it is selling the grinder, which already has been available at the Baratza website, at Seattle Coffee Gear, etc.)?",2,1761977770.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

If you have any critiques or are interested in a part two let me know! A big goal of mine is to end up on a creep cast episode and reading everyone's work on here has inspired me to write my own. Thank you and hope you enjoy it!

( there are themes of death and grieving in this part so this is a trigger warning)

Part 1:



¬†From when I was younger,

I could always remember being afraid of monsters, big and hairy, razor sharp teeth, and claws. But monsters are not real.¬†



I am a Police Officer in my hometown on the coast in New Jersey. Before you ask this was not my aspired profession. After high school my best friend Hannah Murphy and I were accepted into Michigan State. Her parents Melissa Murphy and Gary Murphy owned a small restaurant called Ocean View Cafe known for their burgers across the country. Hannah‚Äôs brother Jacob Murphy is four years older than us and has already graduated from college one year into my studies. My parents Jennifer Campbell and Morgan Campbell are both in the business of money. They met in college and my Mother became an accountant and my Father owns a little tax advisory shop in our town. They both grew up here and since my mom‚Äôs job is remote, she chose to settle down close to family and have me, Aria Campbell. My parents met the Murphy‚Äôs when I started daycare with Hannah, ‚Äúfriends for life‚Äù they‚Äôd say watching us eat our playdough creations together through the playroom window.¬†



My original aspiration was to major in Biomedical Engineering, Hannah was majoring in Pharmacology. I was always known for being gifted in the math department, and as a broke college student I am justified in my college business. What business you ask, doing classmates math homework for cash. In the month leading to spring exams I made $567.10, and got invited to every party. Turns out people like you more as a nerd in college. All I can remember from that time was a mix of studying and drinking until I‚Äôm sure I was on the cusp of liver failure when I received the call. The call that my Grandpa had committed suicide.¬†



George Baker was Chief of Police in my town, he was known as a loveable kind man to everyone. I remember thinking the call was fake. ‚ÄúMom, I can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù I say in an obviously joyous tone as the man known as ‚ÄòBear‚Äô in my class was dancing around handing out some sort of jungle juice.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Grandpa‚Äù my mom said in a defeated tone.

‚ÄúWhat? Hang on let me go outside‚Äù I pushed through other classmates to the door.

I remember the outside crisp air hitting my sweaty skin and I immediately had goosebumps over my entire body. ‚ÄúOkay I can hear you now, what‚Äôd you say mom?‚Äù

I heard muffled crying over the line ‚ÄúGrandpa‚Äôs dead‚Äù

  


The next few months were a blur. I can‚Äôt explain the overwhelming guilt I felt, partying while, my family was falling apart. I flew home two days after the news and felt a coldness in the cab entering my town, then the anxiety pulling into my neighborhood. Taking my bags out of the trunk I felt an immense heaviness settle upon me. Walking up the walkway to my childhood home I felt my ears begin to ring. A place that should be filled with such happy memories and fondness now feels like a darkness, an impossibility. My eyes sting as I turn the knob. The first person I see is my dad, he‚Äôs wearing a whitish grey T-shirt with black dress pants, I can see the sadness emanating from him. His thick eye-brows curved and held out his arms weakly for an embrace.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Mom‚Äôs upstairs‚Äù he said his chin resting on the top of my head. ‚ÄúShe isn‚Äôt doing well‚Äù.¬†



It makes sense seeing as now she‚Äôs lost both her parents now, she was always a daddy‚Äôs girl. After awhile of sitting in the early quite living room with Dad I heard small foot steps making there way toward the hallway upstairs. When my Mom came into view I could tell she had been crying, It looked as though she hadn‚Äôt stopped seeing as her makeup was running. She wore a long velvety black dress, it‚Äôs what I imagine a witch to wear based off every basic iteration. She looked small and defeated. My dad stood and I knew that was the sign we were leaving.



¬†The funeral was held in the center of town at the big old church. My Grandpa was of faith so it felt right for his send off to be where he attends every Sunday. Walking in smelling the faded incenses and the grim lighting is when I broke. My Grandfather, the man who carried me on his shoulders, who promised to protect me from all evils, who cried the hardest at my leaving, is dead. Worse he killed himself, why? Why didn‚Äôt he talk to me? Why didn‚Äôt he tell me or anyone for that matter what he was dealing with? Being a Vietnam veteran and on the force for that long I know he saw it all, I know he lost his faith in humanity. When his Wife died of Pancreatic cancer he held it all together for Mom and vowed to live in every moment with his family. I just can‚Äôt comprehend that he‚Äôd do this. That the last time I saw him was Christmas, when he wore a santa hat and smiled the most out of anyone handing out presents, when I told him I couldn‚Äôt afford a good gift while working my part time job at a coffee shop and got him a small pine candle to stand in until his summer birthday.Even so he cherished the gift, like the answer to all things wrong in this world. All I feel is guilt.



As the funeral progressed a priest read about how good of a man my Grandpa was, all I can look at is the casket. Sitting in the front row of the pews, it was in direct eyeline. Everytime I looked all I felt was an overwhelming heaviness and stinging in my eyes. Once the reading ended we were offered an invitation to speak, many locals from town and Police Officers did. They told the funny stories of my Grandpa on the force and how kind and charitable he was. When we stood up I saw them Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, I ran to them in tears down the aisle, and embarrassed my second mother in a tight hug.



‚ÄúOh honey..I am so so sorry for this loss. We haven‚Äôt stopped praying for him and your family since‚Äù she paused pulling me out of the hug gently. ‚Äú We invited everyone here to the restaurant after for the wake, your Grandfather loved our food and it felt right to donate our place to his favorite people in his honor‚Äù.¬†



She smiled at me, and I felt slightly better. Mrs. Murphy has always been a kind hearted women, she used to host weekly sleepovers for me and Hannah, she even picked me up from school when I started my period in 6th grade.



We all followed the police escorted hearse to the cemetery, since my Grandpa was Chief of police he had a beautiful private plot in an exclusive area. The cemetery was on a hill, the winding roads forming a knot in my stomach. ‚Äò It‚Äôs really real‚Äô. My uncle and a few cousins carried his casket out to the plot from the hearse when I heard a comment from my cousin zachary, ‚Äú wow this is really light‚Äù. Was Grandpa not taking care of himself towards the end? It felt like I was hit by a truck. I watched as the box was lowed into the dry dirt and threw a rose into the pit along with other family. If you were wondering why I didn‚Äôt say how he looked lying there in a faux comfy bed, I don‚Äôt know it was a closed casket due to the nature of his death. Gun shot to the head.



The wake was lively, people laughing, eating, drinking cheap beers. I sat at the counter seat in the Ocean View Cafe. The restaurant is small with a multitude of 4 seater booths in an array of black cushions with small homely tears. Across a small walkway was the counter top, they have an L shaped counter with a high top then dipping into a low top towards the register. With soft tiled floor that definitely used to be white, and a small widow about 5 feet up with a heat lamp inside. Through the small window I can see Mr. Murphy near the grill, his half head of grey hair bobbing in and out of view. He had a soft look similar to his wife, he always sported a half hazard shaven face completed with small razor bumps. His gray shirt stained with grease like always, and it looks like he‚Äôs never replaced his apron, not once. I looked at the food on my plate, a simple slider and a few fries, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to eat. As I‚Äôve mentioned Ocean View is known for their burgers, they‚Äôve been in multiple articles and on the local news more times than I can count. They really are good it‚Äôs a shame I just can‚Äôt find my appetite.



‚ÄúWant me to box that up for you hun?‚Äù Mrs. Murphy said while a shy smile. She wore her dyed black hair to combat the incoming grey in a messy bun now. She had a black turtle neck sweater tucked into a black satin skirt.¬†



‚Äú No Ma‚Äôam, I just can‚Äôt bring myself to eat right now.‚Äù she looked understanding but I couldn‚Äôt help feel rude.



Thats when I felt a hand on my shoulder, ‚Äú Hey Aria, right?‚Äù It was Officer Cullen. He was semi-new to the force and a trainee of my Grandpa‚Äôs.¬†



I gave a slight nod, he continued ‚Äú Your Grandpa always talked about you, he said he always thought you‚Äôd take after him and join the force‚Äù he wore more of a smile now.



‚Äú I never gave it any thought‚Äù I said honestly. Why would Grandpa want me to join something that could‚Äôve lead to his own gruesome fate.



He looked at me in an inquisitive manner for what felt like an eternity and then chose to sit next to me, ‚Äú let me buy you a drink‚Äù he was now smiling and flagging down Mrs. Murphy. He ordered two beers and she gave me a questioning look and then decided to serve me regardless of the fact I am only 19, probably due to the blank expression I wore along with the events of the day. Officer Cullen and I spoke for the rest of the wake, and I had my first beer.
