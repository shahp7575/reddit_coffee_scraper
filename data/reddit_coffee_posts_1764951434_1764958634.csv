1pf2axl,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1pf2axl/what_do_you_think_she_mightve_felt_about_this/,What do you think she might’ve felt about this random coffee meetup?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted a blunt perspective, especially from Indian women.

A couple of weeks ago, I met a girl through Reddit. She had posted asking if anyone was up for a coffee. Since we both live in the same city and were around half an hour away from each other, I said yes. Nothing fancy just a random meetup.

We met at a coffee shop, introduced ourselves, and started talking. She’s an engineering student in her third year, and I’ve just finished graduation and am currently unemployed, looking for a job. I was actually pretty confident and honest because I had no intention of impressing her or anything like that. It was completely random for me.

Surprisingly, I opened up a lot. I shared my travel stories since I do a lot of solo trips. We talked about a lot of things religion, spirituality, life, random experiences and she was very engaged in the conversation. After coffee, we walked around a park and the city for a bit and continued talking.

At one point, she mentioned she’s in a relationship, and her partner lives in another city. I said cool and we just spoke normally about how she manages it.

We didn’t exchange numbers or Instagram or anything. It was literally just a Reddit chat meetup, and after that, neither of us contacted the other. It’s been more than 15 days now, and this whole evening just randomly came back to my mind.

I’m not planning to text her or find her again. I’m the type of person who feels awkward asking for contacts at a first meetup, and she didn’t ask either. For me, it’s chill. I don’t mind. It was just a nice, random evening.

But I’m curious what do you think she might’ve felt from her perspective? Or just give me a blunt take on the whole situation. Nothing extra. Just honest opinions.

1pf2aeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1pf2aeo/response_boomer_told_me_i_couldnt_find_a_job/,RESPONSE: Boomer told me I couldn't find a job because my generation is lazy...,"I wanted to open up [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1peruia/boomer_told_me_i_couldnt_find_a_job_because_my/) a little further because I don't think a lot of the younger generations understand exactly why they aren't able to find a job and why you can't afford a home.  You know it's extremely difficult but do you actually know why?

I just turned 58, not a Boomer but an older GenX.  I want to explain two things:  1.  why it happened and 2.  how to survive.  This is what I know about Boomers from my own generational point of view:

1. I want to acknowledge that every generation after Boomer does indeed have to work a million times harder than Boomers ever did.  By design no generation after Boomers make headway.   Boomers had every opportunity, seized every opportunity and had no resistance in their way.  The economic system was wide open and had room for everyone to grow.  Their wealth grew with the economy which was booming because the generation before them left every opportunity available to them.  All ta Boomer had to do was open up shop and they were set for life.
2. Hypocrisy is as rampant as is lack of empathy in Boomers.  These are people who, in the late 60's were anti-establishment but as soon as they got a taste of success, they not only became the establishment but they made sure nobody else could enter the establishment, and since they grew up with wealth and abundance, and did such a good job of sealing the entry for all other generations, they have no care in the world how incredibly impossible they've made it for the next generations.  It's ignorance by omission.  They didn't experience what my and your generations are up against and for this reason, they have absolutely no clue, therefore, no empathy.  Boomers believe that you should be able to just set up and go as they did, completely overlooking the fact that they sealed the on ramps to the highway behind them.
3. They are the single most entitled, misogynistic generation ever!  This a generation who, In the 1960s, both prescribed and gave women illegal mind-altering drugs to help them cope with societal pressures, often under the guise of promoting their freedom and happiness. This practice reflected a broader societal tendency to control women's behavior rather than addressing their actual needs for support and autonomy.  It was a culture that set women up for consequential sexual ""freedom"" and in this new ""revolution"" women were encouraged to give away free love... while being called whores for giving away their love for free.  It was further reinforced by Hollywood's new set of standards where women wore bullet bras and became sex objects and bombshells.  Women became objects.  Toys.
4. The final blow to all other generations came in the early 2000's with the Transcontinental Trade Agreement (The TPA and the TPP) which is when the abuses of Capitalism became principle.  If you've ever seen the movie [Battle In Seattle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0850253/), GenX tried to stop the abuses of world trade and the World Trade Organization before it happened but there wasn't enough interest because we (GenX) weren't inconvenienced enough to understand what was happening.  It wasn't until 2008 when our lives were deliberately crashed by Lehman Brothers and financial friends did we finally understand because it was IMMEDIATE.
5. Those of us who had small businesses (brick and mortar or online) were literally locked out when Meg Whitman, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden went to China and invited the Chinese government to replace us as they hand delivered China into the ""World Economy"".  Chinese manufacturers who used to supply small American businesses with products stopped selling to us because they were encouraged by the US Government to engage in manufacturer direct sales to consumers via eBay and Amazon.  What's even worse is our own government was handing China trade secrets and data that were withheld it from Americans.  Things like:  What time of day are the best sales, what day of the week, what were the most sought after products, what keywords attract the most attention, HOW TO MAKE THOSE PRODUCTS, and gave them the warehouses, machinery, tools and patterns.  On top of giving our hard work away to China, China was given free shipping (e-packets) on the backs of American tax payers.  Where it would cost $1.29 for the Chinese to ship a product to America, it would cost Americans $64 to ship the same product to China and $8 to ship within our own country.  Products coming into the US are duty free while the same products coming out of the US are all subject to duty.  I believe the postal fee's have encountered a minor increase but the deal remains the same.
6. Google has everything to do with the fall of the American economy as do corporations that you buy from every day like Nike, Apple, pretty much every American clothing, car and toy brand.

It is a little known fact that for five years, Google manually deleted small American businesses (brick & mortar and online; site like ebay) from their search results, featuring ONLY Chinese manufacturer to direct consumer sales.  BUT HERE'S the REAL SHIT:

Remember those shipping deals given to China on the backs of American tax payers?  Guess who else was taking advantage of them?  Apple - with their $1000 phones that only cost $25 to manufacture in China.  Not only were Americans paying already vastly inflated prices but you were paying for the shipping from China.  If you bought your iphone online, you paid for shipping AGAIN.  Every American product that was made in China took advantage of The Universal Postal Union Agreement, and they are STILL taking advantage of them today.

7) If you play video games then you understand what happens to the in-game economy when gold sellers get a hold of it.  Materials become scarce and when you finally do get enough to produce your product, you don't have enough materials to keep the cycle going because the gold sellers have it locked down.  This is the same thing that happened with the world economy.  China is doing everything in its power to keep it all locked down and in their favor.  You can NOT, as an American citizen be angry at China.  The US government handed them opportunity and they ran with it.

The irony is that America never goes into a country to help them.  They into a country under the guise of wanting to elevate their economy while they rape and pillage to their own benefit.  China was ready for America, they knew what America had planned for them but because China was so embedded into every aspect of our country, they knew how to play the game and in turn, it was the Americans who got raped and pillaged.

\---  As for how to survive?  Stop paying income taxes.  Declare yourself exempt and get out of the system.  You fall out of the system after 10 years. Start saving for your own future, Social Security is not going to give you what you can give your own self.  If you're paying $450,000 over a lifetime into a system that only pays you $2000 a month at age 67, you'll NEVER see the total amount that you've thrown in.  If you choose an ""early retirement"" at age 62, the payments are only between $650 to $1200/month which obviously no one can survive on.

STOP believing the whole JFK, ""As not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"".  If you've paid into the system, you are ENTITLED to get it back out of the system.  You are not entitled to pay for the IDFs free healthcare and education.  You are NOT entitled to pay for war in Ukraine and you are not entitled to pay for Ethiopian food, education, social propaganda or ANY of the 173 countries that are given your hard earned tax dollars.  If you are hungry, apply for food stamps and learn how to make sure you get them.  That is YOUR money that is paying for food stamps.  You paid out of every paycheck that you've received for the last 10, 20, 30, 40, 50+ years for that food.  It is yours to take.

Start selling things online and use several different sites.  Know which sites start reporting your sales (they report after you make X dollars) and plan accordingly.

Buy, sell and barter amongst others in your community.

Employ the Amish.  They charge at cost.  The reason true American made items cost more than imported items above and beyond what I already told you is that American materials are much more expensive than those coming in from China.  True American products for the most part are whole i.e. when you buy an Amish coffee table it is made from REAL wood.  It is made to last a lifetime.  Those coffee tables you are buying from Amazon are made from mixtures of cardboard, chipboard, chemicals and crap.  They don't last and you end up spending more money because you have to keep replacing them!

There are very affordable Amish made homes.  Keywords ""Amish made home"".  You can buy a home for as little as $12k to $180k depending on which community you use.  If you look in the right places.  You don't need a McMansion, you need a roof over your head to call home.  Amish build homes can be 10x16 all the way to 14x40 for basic shells.  There's also house kits and prebuilts.

You can also buy a plot of land anywhere between 5k and $30k.  Plumbed composting toilets and drip plumbing are much more affordable than drilling for water and sewage.  Wood burning stoves are much more affordable than electric, gas or oil based heating.  You can also cook on them.

Get out of the system that is breaking you!  Learn to grow your own food.  Grow lights are a cheap as $20 at Walmart!  Chicks can be purchased cheaply!  If you can't buy them locally, USPS is trained to ship them.

Until enough people fall out of the system, it is a system that will continue to feed itself.",1,1764958350.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False

# Banana Gas: Ethylene and Volatility

What type of gas does a banana give off and if it were say in a contained room could it become volatile?

The primary gas bananas give off, especially as they ripen, is **ethylene gas** (*C*2​*H*4​). Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that regulates the ripening process.



# 🍌 Volatility of Ethylene Gas

Ethylene gas is an **unsaturated hydrocarbon** and is classified as a **highly flammable** and **volatile** gas.



* **Volatility and Explosive Potential:** Ethylene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that forms **explosive mixtures** with air at certain concentrations.
   * The **Lower Explosive Limit (LEL)** for ethylene in air is approximately **2.7%** by volume.
   * The **Upper Explosive Limit (UEL)** is around **28.6%** by volume.
* **In a Contained Room:** While ethylene gas is volatile, the potential for a banana-produced explosion in a standard contained room is **extremely low** and practically negligible.
   * The concentration of ethylene produced naturally by a small quantity of fruit, like a bunch of bananas, would be too low to reach the LEL required for an explosive atmosphere in a typical-sized room, even if it were poorly ventilated.
   * Industrial ripening facilities, which use **high, controlled concentrations** of commercially supplied ethylene to ripen large batches of fruit, *do* face explosion hazards and must take strict precautions, which include using inert gases to keep the ethylene concentration below the LEL.

In short, a normal quantity of bananas in your home will not create a volatile, explosive atmosphere. The small amount of ethylene they produce is enough to ripen the fruit and give them their characteristic aroma, but not enough to pose a fire or explosion risk.

Would you like to know which other common fruits are also high producers of ethylene gas?

Sure

# 🍎 High Ethylene Gas Producers

You're interested in other fruits that produce high amounts of **ethylene gas** (*C*2​*H*4​)—the same natural ripening agent that bananas give off. These fruits, along with bananas, are known as **climacteric fruits**, meaning they continue to ripen after being harvested, and this process is accelerated by ethylene.

Keeping these items separate from ethylene-**sensitive** produce (like lettuce, broccoli, and carrots) is important to prevent premature spoilage.

# High Ethylene Producers

Some of the most significant producers of ethylene gas include:

* **Apples** 🍏
* **Avocados** (when ripe) 🥑
* **Apricots**
* **Cantaloupe** and **Honeydew Melons** 🍈
* **Kiwi Fruit**
* **Mangoes**
* **Nectarines**
* **Papayas**
* **Peaches** 🍑
* **Pears**
* **Plums**
* **Tomatoes** (when fully ripe) 🍅

# 💡 Quick Tip for Ripening

The high ethylene output from these fruits is often used as a **kitchen hack** to ripen other produce faster. For example, you can put a hard avocado or an unripe pear in a brown paper bag with a ripe banana or apple. The bag traps the ethylene gas, concentrating it around the other fruit and significantly speeding up the ripening process.

[How Supermarkets get Fruit to Ripen Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzjBAAv9nxc) provides an interesting look at how commercial operations use ethylene gas to control the fruit ripening process.

do they make wine out of apples

Yes, they absolutely make wine out of apples! It is a popular type of **fruit wine**.



Here is a breakdown of apple wine and how it relates to hard cider:

# Apple Wine vs. Hard Cider

Both beverages are made from fermented apple juice, but they are generally distinguished by their alcohol content (ABV) and production method:

||
||
|Feature|Apple Wine|Hard Cider|
|**Alcohol Content (ABV)**|Typically higher, often ranging from **10% to 15%**|Typically lower, ranging from **4% to 8.5%**|
|**Production**|Often involves adding extra **sugar** to the apple juice before fermentation to achieve a higher alcohol level and a more wine-like character.|Usually made from straight fermented apple juice, relying on the natural sugars in the apple.|
|**Stability**|More stable due to the higher alcohol content, making it suitable for longer aging.|Needs to be consumed more quickly due to its lower alcohol content.|

In many regions, the legal distinction is based purely on the alcohol content: anything above a certain ABV (often around 8.5%) is classified as apple wine.



In Germany, a traditional beverage known as ***Apfelwein*** (literally 'apple wine') or ***Viez*** is a popular, tart, and sour cider, usually with an ABV of 4.8%–7.0%.



what other fruits can you make wine out of besides grapes and apples

That is a great question! Winemaking extends far beyond grapes and apples. In fact, you can make an alcoholic beverage (often referred to as **fruit wine** or **country wine**) out of almost any fermentable fruit, and even many vegetables and flowers.

Here is a look at some of the most popular and interesting fruits used to make wine:

# 🍓 Berries

Berries are perhaps the next most common group after apples for making wine, as they often provide excellent color and flavor.

* **Blueberry Wine:** Often results in a lighter, rosé-style wine with a tangy and sweet flavor profile.
* **Blackberry Wine:** Tends to produce a bold, rich red wine that can sometimes mimic the body and flavor of red grape wine.
* **Raspberry Wine:** Creates a delicious wine that is ready to drink relatively quickly and is often used to boost the aroma and color of other fruit wines.
* **Elderberry Wine:** Famous for having a high tannin content, which is a characteristic of red wine grapes, giving it a similar mouthfeel.
* **Strawberry Wine:** A popular sweet wine with a pronounced summer flavor.
* **Cranberry Wine:** Known for its tartness, often produced as a dry or semi-sweet wine.

# 🍑 Stone Fruits

Stone fruits (or drupes) are used to create wines with delicate, juicy flavors.

* **Cherry Wine:** Typically made from tart (sour) cherries, resulting in a vibrant, jewel-toned wine.
* **Peach Wine:** Yields a full-bodied white wine with a fantastic aroma.
* **Plum Wine:** Popular in East Asia (like *Umeshu* in Japan, though that is technically a liqueur). It creates a wine with good character and color.
* **Apricot Wine**

# 🍍 Tropical and Exotic Fruits

These often result in sweeter, highly aromatic wines due to their high natural sugar content.

* **Pineapple Wine**
* **Mango Wine**
* **Banana Wine**
* **Pomegranate Wine**
* **Lychee Wine**
* **Passion Fruit Wine**

# 🍐 Other Popular Options

* **Pear Wine:** Often delicate and aromatic, sometimes blended with other fruits to improve its body.
* **Melon Wine** (like Cantaloupe or Watermelon)
* **Rhubarb Wine:** (Technically a vegetable, but used like a fruit in winemaking)
* **Dandelion Wine:** Made from the flower petals and usually balanced with an acid like lemon juice.

The main difference when making wine from these fruits, as opposed to grapes, is that the winemaker often has to **add extra sugar, acid, and tannins** to the juice to achieve the proper balance for successful fermentation and a high-quality finished product.

Would you be interested in learning about other non-fruit ingredients, like honey or flowers, used to make fermented beverages?

sure

That's a fun direction to take! When you look beyond just fruits, you enter the fascinating world of **country wines** and **meads**, where the main source of fermentable sugar comes from ingredients other than fruit juice.

Here are some of the most popular and historical non-fruit ingredients used to make fermented beverages:

# 🍯 Honey: The Foundation of Mead

The most famous non-fruit alcoholic beverage is **Mead** (often called ""honey wine""), which predates both grape wine and beer.

* **Primary Ingredients:** **Honey** (as the sugar source), **water**, and **yeast**.
* **Flavor:** Mead's flavor can range from bone-dry to lusciously sweet, depending on the amount of honey used and how much sugar the yeast consumes. The flavor is heavily influenced by the **type of honey** (e.g., clover, orange blossom, wildflower, or buckwheat).
* **Variations:**
   * **Melomel:** Mead with fruit or fruit juice added (like cyser, which uses apple juice).
   * **Metheglin:** Mead flavored with **spices** and **herbs** (e.g., ginger, cinnamon, lavender).

# 🌼 Flowers, Herbs, and Vegetables

These ingredients are used primarily for flavor, aroma, and color, and require a significant amount of **added sugar** (like cane sugar or honey) for the yeast to ferment into alcohol.

||
||
|Ingredient|Beverage Type|Description|
|**Dandelion**|**Dandelion Wine**|Made from the yellow petals (the green parts are removed to avoid bitterness), often supplemented with citrus fruits and raisins for body and acidity. It's a light, refreshing, golden-hued wine.|
|**Elderflower**|**Elderflower Wine/Cordials**|Known for its delicate, musky, floral aroma, creating a very light and summery wine.|
|**Roses**|**Rose Petal Wine**|Uses rose petals for an intense, aromatic, and romantic flavor profile.|
|**Ginger**|**Ginger Beer/Wine**|A spicy, often carbonated beverage. True ginger wine is fermented and can have a significant alcohol content.|
|**Rhubarb**|**Rhubarb Wine**|Technically a vegetable stalk, it makes a tart, pale wine that is popular in the UK and Northern climates.|
|**Vegetables**|**Parsnip, Carrot, Beet**|These root vegetables can be boiled and fermented with added sugar to make surprisingly robust ""country wines.""|

# 🍁 Tree Saps and Syrups

* **Maple Sap/Syrup:** Can be fermented to create **Maple Wine** (or a style of mead).
* **Birch Sap:** The sap harvested from Birch trees in spring is fermented into a light, crisp beverage, often called **Birch Wine**.

The possibilities are vast, limited only by the ingredient that can supply or be supplemented with enough sugar for fermentation!

what about Mesquite

That is a fantastic question that digs into the heart of Southwestern cuisine and traditional fermentation!

**Yes, you can absolutely make wine (or a wine-like alcoholic beverage) from mesquite.**



It is not as commonly found commercially as grape or even apple wine, but mesquite bean wine and mead are a part of traditional and home winemaking in arid regions where the tree is native.

Here is how mesquite is used for fermentation:

# 🍯 The Mesquite Pod is the Key

The alcohol is not fermented from the wood, but from the **pods** (often called mesquite beans).



1. **High Sugar Content:** Mesquite pods are naturally very rich in carbohydrates (sugars) and protein, making them an excellent source for fermentation. The sugar content is often high enough that Indigenous groups in the Southwest (like the Pima and Tohono O'odham) traditionally allowed liquid preparations of the pods to ferment into **beer- or wine-like beverages** for ceremonial or social use.
2. **Flavor Profile:** The pods themselves often have a naturally sweet, nutty flavor with notes of honey, which transfers beautifully to the finished wine or mead.
3. **The Process:** To make mesquite wine, the pods are typically crushed and then simmered or steeped in water to extract the sugars, creating a sweet mash or syrup. This liquid is then treated much like fruit juice—yeast is added to ferment the sugars into alcohol.

# 🍷 Mesquite Wine vs. Mesquite Mead

Because the mesquite pod extract doesn't have the high acidity and tannins naturally found in grapes, most mesquite-based alcoholic beverages are closer to a **mead** (honey wine) or a flavored **country wine**.

* **Mesquite Wine:** Made by extracting the sugar from the pods and supplementing it with granulated sugar, acid, and tannins to achieve a higher ABV and balance.
* **Mesquite Mead:** A delicious variation where mesquite honey (made from bees foraging on mesquite blossoms) is used as the primary fermentable sugar, sometimes with mesquite pods added for flavor and color.

So, while you likely won't see it on every wine list, mesquite pods are indeed a viable and historically significant ingredient for making fermented drinks.



Would you be interested in learning about other ways the mesquite tree is used as a food source?

I know some but sure

You're right, many people know mesquite primarily as a wood for BBQ smoking! However, the pods are an incredible food source that was a **staple** for Indigenous peoples of the Southwestern US and Northern Mexico for centuries.

Here are the main ways the mesquite tree is used for food, particularly the pods:

# 1. Mesquite Flour (or Meal)

This is the most popular modern and traditional food use of mesquite pods.

* **How it's Made:** The entire ripe, dry pod (including the hard seeds) is collected, dried, and milled into a fine powder or meal.
* **Flavor Profile:** It has a unique, sweet, nutty flavor with hints of **caramel, cinnamon, or cocoa/molasses**.
* **Culinary Uses:**
   * **Baking:** Since it is **gluten-free**, it's often blended with wheat or other gluten-free flours (like almond or tapioca) to make tortillas, pancakes, muffins, cookies, and quick breads.
   * **Thickener/Flavoring:** It can be added to stews, chilis, or spice rubs for a savory-sweet, earthy depth.
   * **Drinks:** It's stirred into smoothies, coffee, or hot cereals for flavor and nutrition.

# 2. Mesquite Sweetener and Syrup

The natural sweetness of the pods can be extracted for use as a sugar substitute.

* **Syrup:** Pods are steeped or simmered in water to create a sweet, concentrated liquid, which is then reduced by boiling to make a **mesquite syrup** similar to maple syrup or molasses. This is excellent on pancakes or as a glaze for meats.
* **Snack/Gum:** Traditionally, the pods were simply **chewed** raw for a quick boost of energy and sweetness, or the sap (gum) from the tree was eaten as a light, sweet treat.

# 3. Mesquite Honey

While the pods aren't involved, the tree's blossoms are a major source for honey production.

* **Mesquite Honey:** Bees feed on the bright yellow flowers of the mesquite tree, producing a light-colored honey with a distinct, mild, and pleasant flavor.

# 🌟 Nutritional Highlights

Mesquite flour is not just a flavorful ingredient; it's also highly nutritious:

* **Low Glycemic:** The natural sugars are absorbed slowly, which helps prevent blood sugar spikes.
* **High in Fiber & Protein:** It contains a good amount of both protein (11–17%) and dietary fiber.
* **Rich in Minerals:** It's an excellent source of minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, and zinc.

Would you be curious to know how to incorporate mesquite flour into a common baked good, like cookies?

do the pods need to be stratified or can you use them right away

That is an excellent question that clarifies the distinction between two very different uses of the mesquite pod!

The answer is: **No, the pods do not need to be stratified for use as food (like flour or wine), but the seeds** ***inside*** **the pods do need stratification if you want to grow a new tree.**

Here's the breakdown:

# 1. For Food (Flour, Wine, Syrup) → No Stratification Needed

When using mesquite pods for consumption, the goal is to extract the sweet, nutritious pulp and the sugars.

* **Stratification** is a process that mimics winter conditions (cold/wet) to **break seed dormancy** and encourage germination. This is done to grow a plant.
* **For Food Use:** The pods are harvested when they are **dry and brittle** (usually in the summer before the monsoon rains). Once harvested, they need to be processed immediately:
   * **Cleaning/Drying:** They must be kept dry and often heated (toasted in an oven or laid in the sun) to ensure they are fully dry and to kill any beetle larvae (*bruchids*).
   * **Milling/Steeping:** They are then ground into flour or steeped in water (for wine/syrup). The goal is to use the entire pod (pulp and seeds), not germinate the seeds.

>

# 2. For Propagation (Growing a Tree) → Scarification/Stratification is Necessary

If you want to plant the hard seeds found inside the mesquite pods, their hard, protective shell needs to be broken down.

* **Scarification:** This is the primary process needed. It involves physically scratching, nicking, or filing the tough seed coat. In nature, this is often accomplished by the digestive tract of animals.
* **Soaking:** After scarification, the seeds are typically soaked in water (sometimes very hot water) to help them swell before planting.

**In summary, for culinary purposes, you use the pod right away after drying, but for planting, you must first treat the seed.**

While the market obsesses over the next trillion-dollar GPU maker and data-center REITs trade at forty times revenue, a far less glamorous corner of the AI revolution is starting to wake up. **Fluence Energy (NASDAQ: FLNC)**, the Siemens- and AES-backed leader in grid-scale battery storage, closed yesterday at $24.05 after a blistering four-day run that added more than 24% to its share price. For anyone paying attention, the move makes perfect sense: artificial intelligence doesn’t run on hype; it runs on electricity, and the world is suddenly realizing it doesn’t have nearly enough stable power to feed the coming wave of hyperscale data centers.

BloombergNEF estimates that power demand from AI data centers alone will quadruple over the next decade, even as renewable generation is set to double by 2030. Solar and wind are wonderful until the sun sets or the wind dies, which is exactly why utility-scale storage is moving from nice-to-have to mission-critical. Fluence builds the big batteries that keep the grid alive when nature takes a coffee break, and it already counts Amazon, Google, and Meta among its repeat customers.

The company turned its first full-year profit in fiscal 2024, posted record adjusted EBITDA in its most recent quarter, and still trades at roughly 1.2 times next-twelve-months sales. Compare that to almost any other name with “AI” attached to it and the word “undervalued” feels like an understatement. The forward P/E of 93 that scares some investors is simply the market pricing in the explosive growth that is now visibly underway rather than the sleepy 2022 version of the story.

What separates Fluence from the pack isn’t just hardware. Its software platform, Fluence OS, lets grid operators and data-center owners monitor, optimize, and monetize stored energy in real time, turning batteries into profit centers instead of cost centers. That combination of industrial-grade engineering (thanks, Siemens) and decades of grid experience (thanks, AES) has created a moat most pure-play storage startups can only dream about.

The decision to bring manufacturing back to the United States caused short-term headaches and a few delayed shipments last year, but it now looks prophetic. With tariffs on Chinese batteries firmly in place and data-center operators increasingly paranoid about supply-chain security, Fluence’s Arizona and Utah factories are filling up with orders faster than analysts can raise estimates.

Hedge funds have been slow to warm up; only twenty-three portfolios owned the stock at the end of Q2 2025, down slightly from the prior quarter. That lack of crowding leaves plenty of room for institutional money to rotate in once the narrative shifts from “expensive clean-tech name” to “essential AI infrastructure play.” When that happens, the current $4.2 billion market cap will start to look comically small.

The bears will rightly point out execution risk, potential subsidy changes, and competition from Tesla’s Megapack business. Fair points, but Tesla itself has proven that energy can become a multi-hundred-billion-dollar segment when paired with software and scale. Fluence is further along in pure-play storage than Tesla Energy was at a comparable stage, and it’s doing it without the distraction of building cars, robots, or tunnels to Mars.

Put simply, every megawatt of new AI compute needs roughly half a megawatt-hour of flexible storage to stay reliable. Do the math on a million-megawatt buildout and you start to understand why patient investors are suddenly very interested in a company most people still can’t pronounce.

Fluence won’t make the front page of the tech blogs tomorrow, and that’s exactly why the opportunity exists today. While the crowd fights over the last few points of upside in chips and cloud, the quiet leaders building tomorrow’s power grid are just getting started.

Some people drink 1–2 cups, others casually go through 6+ cups a day like it’s nothing 😅

So I wanted to ask the community:

How much coffee do YOU drink daily—and what’s your usual brew?

Espresso? Pour-over? Drip? AeroPress? Something else?

I’ve heard that people in places like Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany, the US, Canada, and the UK have some of the strongest coffee cultures in the world…
So I’m really curious to compare habits here!

Also:
👉 What’s your go-to drink in the morning?
👉 And how strong do you like your coffee?
👉 Do you stick to one method or switch it up throughout the day?

1pf275p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pf275p/the_hurricanes_landfall/,The Hurricane's landfall.,"Ages ago, when I was in my IOP, one of the counselors was known as The Hurricane is a Comin' Man, because he was always saying that. It was kind of an inversion of the ""this too shall pass"" maxim, in that he was telling us that some day in the future of our recovery, some major struggle or tragedy would befall us. ""It may be tomorrow, it may be months from now, hopefully it will be years. But's it's a'comin'."" His hope for us was that we'd build our confidence in ourselves and develop a healthier worldview so we'd be able to ""weather the weather when it comes,"" and to have the strength to endure it without falling back on our respective substance abuse habits or relapsing because that's how we'd dealt with that stuff in the past - by getting wasted and not dealing with it.

As you probably have already guessed, the hurricane made landfall, early last week. Without going into the terrifying details, my daughter fell very ill due to complications from major surgery and went into septic shock due to infection in multiple major organs. Spent Thanksgiving and adjacent days in multiple hospitals, surgeries, and Ronald McDonald Houses\*. It was excruciating for her. To the point, for a couple of those days she was only speaking to ask for two things: water, and to go home. Neither of which were options if she was going to have any chance of seeing her next birthday. During this all, I'm having to remote parent my other children, whom are being looked after by a rotation of relatives, and fret over what kind of holiday season this is for them.

Until yesterday afternoon, when one of the specialists was talking to my wife and I about taking time periodically to take care of ourselves and having the faith to leave her in their care for a few hours, he suggested going somewhere to ""sit down to eat, and have something other than coffee \[with our food\],"" neither alcohol nor sobriety had been even a brief thought. I guess with all of the fear, anxiety, and despair, I'd sort of been drained of all emotion and had been sleepwalking through the days (literally and figuratively).

A little after that, I'd understood what my counselor had been warning me about. I had always took it to mean he was concerned we'd have a huge catastrophe in our lives, it'd be too much to bear, and we'd fall back into our substance abuse. That's not entirely inaccurate, but I think he more recognized, in such times, our recovery/sobriety naturally becomes a secondary concern, at most. We aren't as cognizant or focused because we can't be, and it hinders our vigilance. For a split second I did look at the situation and think ""what does it matter, at this point?""

Thankfully, I've been lucky enough to have received guidance and wisdom from many people like he, over the years. And I'm very gracious that this didn't happen before I'd started my recovery journey. I had to be honest with myself and admit that maybe today, with everything being what it is, it doesn't matter if I do or don't drink. Today. But what I do today will eventually matter in the days/months/years ahead.

Right now, I'm weathering the weather. I invite everyone to strap themselves in and ride this one out, today.

**Why This Pick?**

There are very few wagers I like more than the Rockets to bag a win at home; and without Devin Booker and Jalen Green, I think Phoenix will struggle something awful here. Houston is formidable on defense to begin with, and without the fire power that is Devin Booker, I’ll be surprised if the Suns crack 100 points tonight. At 4-1 ATS in their last 5 outings, I’ve gotta put my money on the Rockets to cover at home.

About Me  
I'm 24 and living in Central PA with my two cats. I present masculine and am AMAB but am exploring my non-binary identity through fashion. I love music and DJ on the side. 

Work & Goals  
I work as a caregiver for adults with disabilities, which I find fulfilling. Outside of work, I’m focusing more on my DJing. My goal is for us to enjoy our youth and freedom together.

Appearance & Style  
I'm 6'0"", with a thin build, brown hair, and brown eyes. I have a self-cut mullet and a few colorful cartoon tattoos. My everyday style is simple streetwear, but for shows, I like to wear more expressive outfits, like crop tops, mesh shirts, and wrap skirts.

Home & Hobbies  
I can be a homebody. I love cooking and organizing my house. I'm not as fond of dishes and laundry (maybe we can work something out). I'm vegetarian, occasionally pescatarian, so I enjoy cooking meals that fit that lifestyle. I like hiking, playing video games, thrifting, and taking care of my houseplants. I’m also v cannabis friendly and have a large glass collection.

Music & Culture  
The rave scene is very important to me. I need a partner who values music as much as I do. I mainly listen to high-energy edm like hard dance, drum and bass, and less frequently experimental bass and riddim. I enjoy jumpstyle, shuffling, and skanking.

Vibe & Personality  
I have ADHD, so I can be a bit inattentive at times, but I offer a lot of love and presence in relationships. I value quality time over constant texting and enjoy quiet companionship, like just doing our own thing in the same room or relaxing together.

Who I'm Looking For  
I'm looking for an independent woman in their 20s with a cool sense of style who feels secure in their own agency; strong women are so attractive to me. 

Values & Mindset  
I'm a genuine leftist focused on class issues and real-world change, not just internet culture wars. I want someone who is secure, independent, anti-authoritarian, and making progress in her own life.

Aesthetics & Expression  
I strongly appreciate self-expression. I'm looking for someone with a good sense of fashion who enjoys getting creative with makeup, I dress slutty at shows and I need a secure partner who can match my energy. Being comfortable in your own skin and confident in your look is very attractive to me. 

Relationship Dynamics & Dealbreakers  
I’m seeking a deep connection and a communicative relationship. I'm very physical, and to me, intimacy isn't just an important part of a relationship for me; it’s a primary love language. A deep connection needs both emotional and physical closeness fairly early on.

I want someone who is open-minded and eager to explore our chemistry. I have a strong interest in kink and alternative dynamics. I believe that the best intimacy is built on trust, communication, and clear boundaries. I feel like I'm really understating the importance of intimacy to me, but I'd rather discuss preferences over DM. 

Kids: I’m thinking about having kids eventually, but I'm entirely open to adopting. I'm not the one having children and I wouldn't ask my partner to go through something like that unless its entirely their decision.

Dealbreakers: I want to connect with people who value alternative career paths or creative goals over traditional corporate jobs, those who are secure and independent, and those focused on real-world change.

If this resonates with you and you're not on the other side of the world, send me a message telling me a bit about yourself and what caught your eye in my post. I’d love to grab coffee, go thrifting, or if you really want to hook me, lets go to a festival for our first meetup! I'll share pictures upfront and hope for the same in return.

1pf243m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1pf243m/where_the_trees_turn_red/,Where The Trees Turn Red,"Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

""Inside Autumn. Light's getting low."" Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

""Think they'll hit the street early again?"" He asked her.

""Not likely.""

Confused, I asked them both, ""What're you talking about?""

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

""Come here, kiddo,"" he said, ushering me to join him by a window. ""I'll show you.""

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

""See that car? The lights?"" Dad asked.

I nodded.

""A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him.""

""Did he find them?"" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. ""He did, but-"" He tossed the words around in his head. ""They'd uh... gone to Heaven.""

""Like Aunty?""

""Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did.""

""Keep us safe?""

""Exactly. They keep us all safe.""

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

""But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?""

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

""Do you see her?!"" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

""*Sean*."" Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

""See who?"" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, ""You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn.""

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. ""Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?"" He whispered. ""Who'd you think she annoyed?""

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. ""Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though,"" she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. ""Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch.""

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. ""Everyone has a bad day,"" I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. ""Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her.""

Kate then nudged my arm. ""She's looking at you, by the way.""

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. ""Hello? You still with us?""

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. ""Don't! Let her sit by herself.""

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, ""Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother,"" all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. ""Dude, are you good?""

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

""Autumn, right?"" She beamed as I took a seat. ""Sean's sister?""

""Who did that to you?""

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

""Was it your dad?"" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. ""Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell.""

""Was it Ben? You overstepped?""

She paused and then nodded slowly.

""You've been seeing him without me?"" Sean asked.

""You haven’t?""

""Who's Ben?"" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

""Local press,"" Sean said. ""Red hair, built like a stick-"" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, ""-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition.""

My stomach churned. ""You've been out there?! What, at night?!"" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. ""I told you she'd be keen."" She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. ""You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-""

""I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise.""

""Is that right?"" Willow teased.

""*Yes*."" He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. ""And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind."" He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. ""Or yours, I hope.""

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. ""Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-""

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. ""Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure.""

""Oh, come on."" She pouted. ""I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!"" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. ""When?""

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

""Back to your friends, kiddo. Now.""

""I don't... why'd I-""

""*Autumn. Now.""*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

""Why don't we pay him a visit?"" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

""Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?"" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. ""What could go wrong?""

""Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one,"" Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, ""scratch her itch.""

""It's not an... 'itch', Kate.""

""Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?""

""Hey, back off."" Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. ""It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch.""

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. ""Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-""

""Or get laid.""

""Or write music!"" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. ""I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'.""

""You guys suck.""

""No we don't.""

Arthur clasped his hands together. ""Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy.""

Barney groaned, ""I don't know, man... Mom would always say-""

""Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?""

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

""Yeah, no thanks."" Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. ""Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?""

""Nope.""

""Marvellous.""

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

""Hello?!"" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. ""Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here.""

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. ""Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?""

""You're more likely to see rats, Arthur."" She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. ""Guys,"" he cried, peering down at the floor, ""come take a look at this.""

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

""Oh, God no,"" Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

""You fucking found it, dork,"" Kate said. ""What're you complaining about?""

""And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?"" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. ""Ladies first."" He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

'Search For Missing Hiker Continues'

'Police Abandons Search For Missing Son - Family Left Without Answers'

'Search For Missing Girl Continues'

'History Repeats? Another Youth Vanishes Near Old Mines'

'Strange Lights Spotted By Shoreline!'

'Search Continues For Missing Dog'

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Did Mom and Dad know?

'Local Sheriff Disappears - Foul Play Suspected'

'Community Divided Over Nighttime Curfew'

'Who Is Enforcing The New Rules? Authorities Silent!'

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. ""Autumn!"" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. ""What do we do?"" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. ""We could go to the woods.""

""Not a chance!"" Barney whined. ""I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-""

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. ""Bears?"" She gestured to the room we stood in. ""That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*""*

""Guys!"" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. ""Can we... not argue, please?"" I then looked at Arthur. ""Get a picture of that map.""

Barney shrivelled up into himself. ""No, we can't-""

Kate punched him in the shoulder. ""We can, and we are.""

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. ""Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads.""

""Not a chance."" Arthur pressed quietly.

""Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise."" I lied.

""Are you sure?"" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. ""See you tomorrow."" He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. ""Do you want to go home?""

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

""No.""

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. ""Last chance.""

""I'm sure.""

He managed a comforting smile. ""Okay.""

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

""Who's this?"" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. ""His sister.""

""Huh. Impeccable timing, kid.""

An anxious energy came over Sean. ""Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-"" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. ""Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along.""

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. ""We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?""

""Heads up!"" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. ""Listen.""

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

""What is that?"" I asked.

""No idea."" Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. ""Hope you messaged Arthur.""

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. ""We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not.""

Willow let out a tiny laugh. ""You want what I want, right?"" Then she looked at me. ""Having fun yet?"" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

""I'm not scared."" I blurted out.

""I know, but-""

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

""We should... probably leave,"" Sean said, dreary and sheepish. ""Tell someone.""

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

For some context, for the past 10 years, I've been using a Gaggia Anima, which I've been generally happy with except for the Pannarello wand, which I dislike (I always modify Pannarellos with a simple piece of tape to block off the carburetor port, which helps a bit but is not perfect). The machine was getting a bit beat-up, so figured I'd replace it. Also, I needed a machine for second location, so I actually in the market for 2 new machines.

On paper, the Accademia looks really nice - except every automatic milk frother machine I've ever used has produced lackluster milk, so I wasn't sure if I wanted that feature. Nonetheless, I decided to audition the Accademia first. I will say, the Accademia's milk carafe is beautifully designed compared to others I've used - the automatic steam-cleaning cycle for it is a nice touch. After use, you can just pop the whole thing back into the fridge, which is very handy. However, as expected, the quality of the milk produced by the auto system leaves something to be desired. The manual ""pro style"" steam wand works beautifully, though! The reality is, I'm not likely to use the auto-milk dispenser and simply steam the milk myself to get what I want. So I was thinking paying the premium price and getting that feature that I'm not likely to use might not be worth it.

Enter the Cadorna Barista Plus - like OP ([in the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i509ll/gaggia_accademia_vs_cadorna_barista_plus/)), I thought this one looked nearly identical to the Accademia, minus the auto-milk carafe. The truth is, while they share the same brew group (as MANY models do), there are many other differences that put the Accademia at a higher level. Here is a list of the features that are lacking on the Cadorna vs the Accademia:

1. Customizable pre-brew infusion. The Cadorna pre-brews, but you have no ability to customize this or turn it off. Accademia lets you disable, or set short or long pre-brew infusions and save these settings for custom drink preferences.
2. Espresso Plus System. Lets you adjust the flow rate to slow down the extraction process. Accedemia has it; Cadorna does not.
3. Custom naming of saved coffee preferences. This seems trivial, but to me its kind of a big deal. The Accademia lets you save a custom name for drinks in your profile. For example, I have a profile set up that has a ""SINGLE SHOT"" w/ custom espresso settings. Then I added a separate custom espresso drink which automatically does 2 shots, and named this one ""DOUBLE SHOT"". Very handy to have both options in the profile's custom drink options. Being able to name them separately makes it work out. HOWEVER, on the Cadorna, there is no way to customize a drink name - so if you create a custom ""ESPRESSO"" with dose, temp, etc you can save that to your profile, but if you want to ad a double-shot espresso to the same profile, you cannot - because it will automatically be named ""ESPRESSO"" and the machine won't let you save two options with the name name in a single profile, so you can either store the single-shot prefence, OR the double-shot, but NOT both. For me, that's annoying.
4. Custom profile as default ""home"" screen. Accedemia does this, Cadorna does not. So on the Cadorna, if you enter in a custom profile and make one of the options, when it is done it kicks you back to the machine's default profile, with all the default options. So if you want to create something like a double-shot, you have to navigate back to your custom profile after the first shot to get your custom shot settings, and its too easy to inadvertently run the default espresso option instead of digging up your custom profile one. So if you expect to mainly use custom settings from a profile, the Cadorna is going to end up being a PITA.
5. Cup warmer. Cadorna is passive - only heats up when the boiler is on during normal operation. On the other hand, the Accademia has a nicer warmer that can be turned on independently via schedule, so if you regularly get your coffee around the same time each day, you can have the schedule switch on the warming a bit earlier so your cup is warm when you go to use it, which is nice.
6. Touch screen interface. Accademia has it, and Cadorna does not. And its nice. I worry that the rubber buttons on the Cadorna might not hold up well in the long run (the buttons on my Anima pretty much had their labels worn off after 10 years of use - worked fine, but looked awful).
7. All-steel case. Cadorna is just the ordinary black plastic exterior. 

1 and 2 I think help you dial in a better brewed cup.

With that said, the ONE gripe I have with the Accademia is the small size of the internal drip tray, and the speed it fills up at. Depending on how often you use it, you may find yourself having to empty that tray multiple times per day.

So yeah, at this point I'm strongly considering returning the Cadorna and getting a second Accademia for the other location. It bugs me that the auto-milk system is a big feature that I'm not likely to use very often (if at all), but the overall jump in build and features kind of make the Accademia the overall winner in my book.

I think in my perfect world, the ideal machine would be based on the Accedemia, but delete the milk carafe feature and replace it with a 2nd boiler with manual steam knob. Dare to dream!",1,1764957772.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

We’re engaged yet state married if anyone asks, happy overall. Their family accepts me, and they have four kids (21, 17, 13, and 9) from their previous relationship. I’ve always wanted a big family, so that part has never been an issue.

The problem started during our last Christmas together. Their ex the father of the kids was invited to our little family event. He was supposed to come with his partner, stay a few hours, and then leave, but none of that happened. He showed up alone, and my partner left with him to get coffee at a gas station and talk about one of the kids' gifts on how they would present it (computer). They didn’t ask if I wanted to come along just if I wanted a coffee. My partner seemed excited to go with them, even though they had always said they didn’t like or were afraid of their ex.

When they came back, my partner was still cheerful, acting like nothing unusual happened. The ex gave my partner several gifts and gave me an already-open pack of prerolls which i was hesitant over. Later decided, after the kids opened their presents and went to their rooms to take a couple puffs. I got extremely sick, head rush, unable to get up and had to lie down for hours. During that time, the youngest asked me for help, and I could barely move and asked them to get their mom but let me know they didnt know where they were. When I woke later, I heard the youngest saying, yelling that they wanted to go with their parents somewhere. Apparently my partner and their ex went out and even planned to go for a jog together and didnt want them tagging along. The ex never left when he was supposed to and even came with us to the gathering with my partner’s family (my in-laws).

When I asked my partner about it, they brushed it off at first, saying plans just changed and nothing happened. They said the ex stayed to be with the kids, even when the kids weren’t around. They didn’t admit the jog until months later and claimed they simply forgot.

Now fast-forward to this Christmas. The ex can’t attend the family event and is no longer with his partner, but he still wants to come see the kids. Our city has limited, expensive accommodations and he lives in another city. When I asked where he would be staying, my partner said they didn’t know. When I brought up concerns and boundaries, we got into an argument because my partner said they didn’t see an issue with him staying on our couch if needed. They said they wouldn’t be involved since the ex would be spending time with the kids and planning their holiday activities.

I don’t have issues with co-parenting or sharing holiday time, but I’m uncomfortable with him staying on the couch and with how blurry the boundaries feel especially considering what happened the last Christmas. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or if my concerns are reasonable since I’ve never been in a relationship where someone shares custody and my deep trauma around being cheated on from previous relationship. 

 tl;dr

  Im with someone that shares custody of their kids, we spent our last Christmas together with a set plan that fell through. I got sick and ended up in bed most of the day, the ex stayed longer than intended and they spend the day together. This Christmas they want to come to our city to spend time with them for the holiday and potentially stay on the couch.  My feelings are hurt even a year after, and I’m not sure how to handle or communicate this effectively to them. Id love some advice, insight, and if you've dealt with something similar on how to move forward ",1,1764957610.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

**A Comprehensive Analysis of Filipino Band Cup of Joe's Success Factors in 2024–2025**

**Abstract**

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the phenomenal success of the Filipino alternative pop band Cup of Joe (COJ) in the 2024–2025 period. Their rise from a Baguio-based collegiate act to a national chart-dominating group is attributed to a successful four-part synergy: the creation of a **versatile and sophisticated musical style** (experimental pop); **lyrical mastery** that transforms poetry into universally relatable sentiment; a **compelling, unpretentious band identity**; and the **strategic mobilization of digital platforms**. This confluence of artistic integrity and modern market awareness has cemented COJ's place as a defining force in contemporary Original Pilipino Music (OPM).

**1. The Creative Foundation: Musical Versatility and Sophistication**

The core of Cup of Joe's success lies in their ability to synthesize diverse musical influences into a signature, accessible sound.  

• **Experimental Pop Fusion:** COJ's genre is best classified as **experimental pop** , containing elements of acoustic rock, retro-wave, neo-folk, and modern alternative ballads. This versatility prevents the band from being pigeonholed, allowing them to traverse different emotional registers—from the melancholic yearning of **""Multo""** to the driving guitar riffs of **""Sandali.""**  

• **Production Quality:** The band exhibits a sophisticated approach to sound layering, utilizing **swelling synths, mesmerizing harmonies**, and **textured instrumentals**. This professional production quality elevates their music beyond typical indie acts, making it competitive on global streaming platforms.  

• **Vocal Dynamics:** The dual-frontman structure, featuring the husky tone of Raphaell Ridao and the smooth, belting ability of Gian Bernardino, provides unique harmonic complexity that is rare in modern bands. The layered vocal arrangement, notably highlighted in the climax of ""Multo,"" creates a signature sound that is both rich and emotionally resonant.  

**2. Lyrical Resonance: The Power of Poetic Imagery**

Cup of Joe's lyrics, written primarily in Tagalog, are crucial to their deep connection with the Filipino audience.  

• **Eloquent Imagery and Metaphors:** The band excels at crafting vivid imagery and using scenic surroundings, often influenced by their home city of Baguio, as metaphors to convey complex emotions. This style transforms poetry into accessible pop music, allowing listeners to personalize the narrative of the song.  

• **Universal Themes via ""Hugot"":** While the imagery is local, the themes are universal: **grief, acceptance, denial, and finding comfort.** The album Silakbo (meaning ""outburst of emotion""), for instance, is lauded for being an emotional journey that articulates **""what happens after""** grief stops being an event and becomes a continuous language. This focus on deep emotional processing gives their songs a longevity beyond simple heartbreak anthems.  

• **Relatability:** The songs resonate because they offer **comfort and reflection**, much like the namesake, a cup of coffee. Tracks like **""Tingin,""** **""Misteryoso,""** and the chart-topping **""Multo""** became cultural touchstones because their narratives mirrored the collective emotional experiences of young Filipino listeners.  

**3. Strategic Identity and Digital Engagement**

The band's identity and approach to the digital landscape amplified their artistic efforts.

• **The ""Ordinary Person"" Identity:** The name Cup of Joe—symbolizing a regular, unpretentious beverage and representing an **""ordinary person""**—perfectly aligns with their identity as student-musicians sharing their art. This **humble, relatable branding** fostered a strong, authentic connection with their primary fanbase, ""Joewahs.""  

• **Digital Chart Dominance:** Their success is a clear indicator of effective digital strategy. The release of their debut album Silakbo led to their most defining metric of 2025: **""Multo"" leading the Billboard Philippines Hot 100 for 27 consecutive weeks** and the band being named the **Most-Streamed Local Artist on Spotify in the Philippines for 2025**.  

• **Cultivating Fandom:** The band's chemistry, often described as a ""band of brothers,"" translates effectively to their live shows and online content, reinforcing the perception of sincerity and teamwork, which are highly valued by OPM fans.  

**4. Conclusion**

The success of Cup of Joe is not accidental but rather the result of a deliberate, authentic artistic process intersecting with optimized modern digital distribution. Their mastery of **experimental alt-pop,** coupled with deeply resonant, poetic **Tagalog lyrics**, allowed them to capture the heart of the Filipino youth market. Their achievements, particularly the unprecedented chart longevity of ""Multo"" and their major award wins, position them as not only a commercial powerhouse but also a critical force redefining the sound of contemporary OPM.

My T4 is elevated still which is one thing, but for the life of me I can’t lower my inflammation. All of my bloodwork for the past 3+ years shows inflammation with fluctuating levels but is currently trending upwards.

To be frank, I live one of the healthiest lifestyles out of anyone I know. I prioritize sleep, getting good rest from roughly 10:00-10:30PM - 6:30-7:00AM nearly every day, I remain in a calorie deficit almost every day (with NO signs of weight loss, another extremely frustrating point) and prioritize protein and fiber in every meal. I am not overly restricting calories as that could cause an inverse effect (I stay around 1400-1600 with ~100+g protein daily, moderate carbs, healthy fats, 25-30g fiber daily) and a whole food diet. I work out 4-6 days a week, avoiding HIIT workouts (because they can cause inflammation) and focus on strength training and light running a few times a week. I drink plenty of water. I don’t drink alcohol. I drink coffee MAYBE 1-2 times a week and avoid having it on an empty stomach.

What the hell else am I supposed to do? I feel so defeated. And the thing is, ALL of my other labs are optimized. I feel pretty much fine most days. 

I do have an ultrasound scheduled today to check for thyroid nodules. They came up around 15 years ago when I was 18 and first diagnosed but there was never any follow up. I only remembered in the last few months. So we’ll see what the results are there. I also need my cortisol levels checked. So, those 2 tests may provide more answers.

Not really sure what I’m looking for here other than needing to scream into the void. Chronic inflammation can lead to scary things and I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do to control it.

I built a workflow that turns a single idea in a Google Sheet into a ready-to-post social media draft. Here's the step-by-step breakdown so you can build it too.

## The Challenge I Faced

Content creation was eating up hours of my week. I'd have great ideas but struggle to turn them into engaging social media posts. The blank page paralysis was real! I needed a system that could take my raw thoughts and transform them into polished, platform-ready content.

## My n8n Solution Breakdown

Here's how I built this content generation machine:

**1. Google Sheets Trigger**
- Set up ""On Row Added"" trigger to watch my ideas sheet
- Captures: Topic, Target Platform, Tone (Professional/Casual/Funny)
- Pro tip: Use data validation in Sheets for consistent tone options

**2. OpenAI Node Magic**
- Model: GPT-3.5-turbo (cost-effective for this use case)
- Prompt structure I use:
```
Create a {{$node[""Google Sheets""].json[""tone""]}} social media post for {{$node[""Google Sheets""].json[""platform""]}} about: {{$node[""Google Sheets""].json[""topic""]}}

Requirements:
- Hook in first line
- 2-3 key points
- Call-to-action
- Appropriate hashtags
```

**3. Content Formatting with Code Node**
I add a Code node to clean up the AI output:
```javascript
const content = $input.first().json.choices[0].message.content;
const formatted = content
  .replace(/\n\n/g, '\n')
  .trim();

return [{ json: { formatted_content: formatted } }];
```

**4. Back to Google Sheets**
- Updates the same row with generated content
- Adds timestamp and ""READY FOR REVIEW"" status
- Creates a clean workflow for batch content creation

## Key n8n Insights I Discovered

**Dynamic Prompting**: Using `{{}}` expressions in OpenAI prompts makes the workflow incredibly flexible. Different tones produce vastly different results from the same input.

**Error Handling**: Added an IF node to check if OpenAI response exists before processing. Saves you from broken workflows when API limits hit.

**Batch Processing**: The beauty is I can add 10 ideas to my sheet during coffee, and come back to 10 ready-to-review drafts.

## Real Results

This workflow cut my content creation time from 2 hours to 15 minutes for a week's worth of posts. The AI doesn't always nail it perfectly, but it gives me a solid starting point that beats the blank page every time.

I've generated over 200 social posts this way, and honestly, about 70% need only minor tweaks before publishing.

## Make It Yours

Want to adapt this? Here are some variations I'm considering:
- Add sentiment analysis to match content mood to posting time
- Include competitor analysis by scraping their recent posts
- Auto-schedule approved posts using Buffer or Hootsuite nodes

What content creation challenges are you facing? Would love to hear how you'd modify this workflow for your needs!

My v60 is less consistent. for med to dark beans. I brew 22-24 clicks, 24g coffee 300ml water. Yes the ratio is high, I like it to seem a little closer to moka, just brighter and cleaner.

With lighter beans I struggle to achieve this. Definitely see signs of too much c02 - so Ive got a bag sitting right now another week to let it get 3 weeks from roast. 

Going finer usually results in clogged drip and super long brew (5min+) and over-extraction taste.  Ive also tried the other end, much coarser, no agitation. lots of acidity but borderline sour, missing some sweeter notes. 

But today I had a great cup by just aiming for less. 19 clicks. 16g coffee 200ml output. tasted great, took longer to brew, definitely clogged the filter but got a great smaller cup of coffee.

We’ve known each other since freshman year, always got along, split rent and utilities 50/50, no drama. Seemed perfect.

About a month after we moved in Tyler has gotten addicted to gooning. If you don’t know what that is, it’s basically edging for hours (sometimes six, eight, ten hours straight) while watching porn and repeating captions out loud like a zombie. At first I thought he was just horny and jerking off a normal amount. I’d hear some moaning through the wall, whatever, I’d turn my music up.

Now it’s every single night and half the day. He starts at like 11 p.m. and doesn’t stop until the sun comes up. The walls are thin as hell so I hear everything: the slapping, the whimpering, the “yes mommy ruin my life” audio clips on loop, the occasional cult-sounding chants. I wear earplugs plus noise-canceling headphones and I can still hear him. I haven’t had a full night’s sleep in weeks. I’m falling asleep in class and my grades are tanking.

The living room smells like a gym locker mixed with old cum because he’ll just wander out in his boxers at 4 a.m. to grab another energy drink and keep going on the couch. I’ve found crusty tissues on the coffee table we both use. I’m grossed out and exhausted.

I’ve talked to him four separate times, chill at first, then not chill. Told him he can do whatever he wants in his own room with the door shut and headphones on, I literally don’t care, but the all-night marathon with the volume up is ruining my life. Every time he just laughs it off and says he needs to ""control his desires"" and other weird defenses.

Last night at 3 a.m. I banged on his door and told him if he doesn’t knock this shit off I’m breaking the lease, eating the penalty fees, and moving out. I’m done. He’s now telling everyone I’m a dramatic baby who can’t handle a guy “taking care of his needs” and that I’m bailing on him over “natural male behavior.”

A familiar pendulum,"Teams found out on the previous mat that their next leg would be in Paris, so that they could film a mini advert for Expedia’s flight-booking app. God bless Expedia for keeping our little show going through these years. I do miss the Roaming Gnome though.

They all took the same flight to CDG (what an awful airport) and hopped in taxis to find the Moulin Rouge. Joseph and Adam were very surprised to find themselves in first when they arrived and set to work learning the steps of the can-can. They wondered if this was how Jas and Jag must feel.

Speak of the devil, it was those two who arrived next and worked very fast (as they always do). Izzy and Paige arrived in the background while Kyland and Taylor began to argue with the taxi driver if he knew where he was going (he did sound a bit clueless). I noticed they were holding a map that said “Parigi”, the Italian for Paris, showing they had bought it back in Milan. Good thinking! Kyland was pretty nervous about having to learn a dance, which he felt was his weakest skill.

Sag and Saj made a pretty hilarious first attempt where they got absolutely nothing right, but it seemed to be more of a strategic step to learn the rhythm and feel of the song. They commented that they had done “the Can’t-Can’t”. How very droll, let's make that the title of the episode. When they came out a second time, they fucking nailed it. HOW are they so good?!? They seem to be able to memorise things very quickly, and then also communicate effectively while having great critical thinking skills. They’re honestly the perfect racers.

Kyland managed to overcome his fear by learning the details of the dance just as he had done the details of the flowers on the previous leg, and they managed to overtake two teams by being the second to leave. Both I+P and J+A were crashing, but Paige reminded Izzy that this was okay; this leg was *supposed* to feel this hard. It seemed like the right thing to say, and that definitely would have helped me in that situation. I+P came out as the victors of the last two, leaving Joseph and Adam in the awkward situation of having been the first to get there but the last to leave.

Then, all teams headed to the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral, now reopened after the fire in 2019. It’s funny because I wrongly remembered that fire as happening in 202,0 along with COVID and everything else, but I must have been wrong about that. Gas asked, “Is this the Hunchback of Notre-Dame?” It’s funny when you’ve heard of something all your life but never really questioned where it came from. I know I’ve had moments of clarity like that in my life. But if he’s seen the film, surely he’d remember the cathedral in it? Maybe he didn’t realise what “Notre-Dame” was referring to.

The next stop was a school for blind children (I’ve never heard of such a thing, but I’m glad it exists) for a roadblock where one team member needed to write part of The New Colossus, the poem from the Statue of Liberty, in braille without any mistakes. It would have been cooler if teams had to actually learn Braille without the use of their eyes; maybe that could be a future challenge, have them identify ten letters in Braille somehow. I’ve been fascinated by Braille ever since I played Pokémon Ruby and part of a puzzle was in Braille (which is awkward because it’s not like you can feel bumps on a screen). It’s extraordinary that blind people can interpret those tiny bumps and not get confused, but from what I’ve read, the use of braille is now declining due to advancements in technology. Plus, you don’t really see braille around all that much, so it’s not particularly useful in the wide world. But I’m glad there are publications available for blind people.

This was a challenge of perfection, and all the teams knew it. Jas performed the roadblock exceptionally slowly, triple-checking everything, causing the judge and adjudicator to talk about getting a coffee. His hard work paid off, as he completed the assignment perfectly on the first try. Of course he did.

As they left the institute, Kyland and Taylor were running in, much to the surprise of J+J, who had seen them arrive last at the Moulin Rouge. Taylor also worked slowly, prompting another cup of coffee. I like how these diva judges decided to insert their personality into the show by feigning boredom and desire for caffeine.

J+A caught a break by reaching Notre-Dame faster than I+P and then getting to the institute ahead as well. It was Joseph’s turn with the roadblock after Adam did two on the previous leg, and he felt very personally attached to this task as he revealed that his mother was losing her sight. Izzy arrived shortly after, and the room was full of clicking and clacking.

When Taylor got out of there, it was a true Hare vs Tortoise race, with Izzy clacking away while Joseph was stressfully checking each letter two or three times. The noise of her typing was very off-putting to him as it made it seem like he had no chance to catch up with her. However, Izzy was making lots of mistakes. One of them she caught early, but on at least two other occasions, she was forced to redo it all by the judge’s red marker. It’s one of the most tense situations I’ve seen all season.

Eventually, Joseph got up and handed his work to the judge, expressing how he’d double-checked every single letter. With trembling emotion in his voice, he turned to face away from her as he simply couldn’t watch. It really seemed like a single mistake would have broken him at that point, but the judge instead gave him good news. Like the fable, the tortoise won! Izzy finally completed her work alone and came to Paige with tears in her face. I could really feel the emotions at this point.

Coincidentally enough, I had been thinking about the Scramble from last season that didn’t go particularly well (as everyone did everything in the same, logical order), and wondered if they’d attempt it again. They did! This time, it wasn’t a scramble to do various challenges, but more of a scavenger hunt around town, and it was still sufficiently scrambly for me. Even if there was a fastest way to get all three of the pieces of the puzzle (found at the three smaller Statues of Liberty dotted around Paris), teams would also have to factor in the distance to the pit stop afterwards, located at the famous Place du Trocadero, which would be made obvious from their clue.

After visiting the Pont du Grenelle first, Sag and Saj passed Trocadero and recognised the building that was part of their puzzle in miniature, and realised that it was probably where they’d have to go last. Yes, it turns out that the pit stop was significantly closer to Pont du Grenelle than either the Jardins du Luxembourg or the Museum of Arts and Crafts… and speaking of…

As Jaj and Gag arrived at their last spot, I recognised a very familiar pendulum swinging nearby their final statue. I had to check… Yes! It was indeed the infamous WRONG Foucault pendulum from Season 1 (Leg 3). God bless the editors for throwing in that little visual Easter Egg but not giving it too much fanfare. That’s a reference only true fans of the show will get.

Gag and Gas were self-doubters, thinking it could be anyone’s game at this point, since they might not have taken the optimal route (looking at a map, I’d say optimal route is INJA - Luxembourg - Museum - Grenelle - Trocadero), but they were also so far ahead of everyone else that it was no surprise that they came first once again, winning a trip to Fiji. If they somehow manage to screw up the next leg and not come in first, it will be an entertaining finale indeed.

Kyland and Taylor were second, having impressed themselves by coming from last. Are we surprised that the two teams who were handed Express Passes are also the ones in the finale? I think they’ve just been strong teams in general. K+T have been put at much more risk, of course, but I think their mutual care for each other has seen them through. Kyland spoke about how this race has managed to restore some of the friendship that they had been missing, which was sweet. Normally, couples tend to become the worst versions of themselves on the race due to the stress, so it's funny to see them actually go the opposite way here.

J+A and I+P were still running the scramble. Each of them got their last clue and began to head towards Phil when suddenly… “TO BE CONTINUED.” WHHAAAT!? No fair! At least when they did this last season, there was only a day or two before the final episode, but this time we have to wait a whole week! I’m not fond of them cutting off eliminations like this! It’s not the format of the show!

Besides, I speculate that it’s quite obvious who’s going to reach Phil first. >!J+A began the scramble earlier and picked up their last clue at Pont de Grenelle, meaning they took a more optimal route. Izzy and Paige instead took a horribly inefficient route, going from Luxembourg to Grenelle and THEN to the Museum, meaning they’re going to have to travel all that distance back to Trocadero. I don’t really see a situation where I+P make it to the finale unless something terrible happens to J+A in the short distance between Grenelle and Trocadero.!<

This was a really good penultimate episode, a lot of laughs and tension, as well as a great retelling of “The Hare and the Tortoise” at the Institute for Blind Youth. I had guessed, with all of the Statue of Liberty-themed challenges, that the last leg would take place in NYC, and I was glad to be right about that. It’ll be rather like the first season’s finale all over again.",1,1764957024.0,TheAmazingRace,4,1.0,False

The “Nordic lifestyle” offers a refreshing alternative: a way of living grounded in balance, nature, simplicity, and well-being.

**What the Nordic Lifestyle is all about**  
Nordic living emphasizes slowing down, prioritizing what really matters, and building habits that nurture both mind and body.

* **Friluftsliv — Open-air living & nature connection**: Spending time outside is a core part of daily life in Nordic countries, whether walking, hiking, cycling or simply sitting in the fresh air. This connection with nature helps reduce stress, improve mood and boost physical wellness. 
* **Hygge / home-comfort & mindful relaxation**: Hygge means creating a cosy, comfortable, stress-free environment — think warm light, simple comforts, relaxed dinners or coffee with loved ones. It’s about embracing small pleasures and calmness instead of constant rush. 
* **Lagom — Balance & moderation**: Lagom means “just the right amount” — not too much, not too little. Applied to daily life, it encourages moderation in consumption, scheduling, and commitments: enough work, enough rest, enough pleasure, but nothing excessive.
* **Community spirit and slow living**: The Nordic lifestyle values social connection, trust, and community — whether through shared rituals, simple socializing, or cooperation. There’s also a focus on meaningful leisure, rest, and slowing the pace of daily life.

❔❔ Which Nordic habit (friluftsliv, hygge, lagom or something else) would you try first — and why?

1pf1mck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1pf1mck/advice_needed/,advice needed,"Hi everyone. I have been lurking in this subreddit for awhile, and as such feel that the position I am in definitely is NOT normal or functional, but need a sanity check and advice. Long post incoming 

I left a position in biglaw about 6 months ago to be an EA at a boutique litigation firm, working for the founding partner. It was a huge pay bump (6 figure salary), so I was super excited. They mentioned to me in a throwaway email that there was some PA work involved, and I was ok with that. They brought me on to alleviate some of the workload for the other EA of his based in the same office. 

I work on a team of 2-3 other EAs supporting this single partner. 2 are actual EAs, one is the receptionist that also assists with him (she makes him coffee and is the primary carer of his dog). 1 of the EAs is in a different city. 

At first I was thrilled with the opportunity to have a team dynamic, I am very comfortable working on teams and the ladies seemed great. The exec is very dysfunctional, but I figured it was nothing a team of four dedicated to one person could not handle. 

Some examples of our job duties: Looking after his dog which he brings to the office (includes walking, picking up after, and occasionally picking up/dropping off the dog from his house), manage his entire personal life (property taxes, utility bills, medical appointments, car maintenance/cleaning, dinner reservations to name a few), errands as needed, he wrote a book and I planned an entire tour for him to speak about his book... I assist with firm event planning/BD events, I went to trial with him, but the bulk of my work now is personal stuff. This was not what I had anticipated, and I am not loving it. 

The exec himself is extremely non-communicative. He will ignore you when you ask questions and you kind of just have to figure it out. He texts at all hours of the night and weekends and you are expected to respond on an ASAP basis. This was not represented to me during the interview process (despite me asking what the OT requirement was). 

He also plays favorites - the main EA is given certain privileges that he doesn’t give to the others (fancy gifts). At first I thought this was because she was just really on top of her job and shining, but now with some time here, I am starting to wonder if she has cemented herself there by deliberating not communicating and undercutting the other team members. 

When I came onboard, I tried to change things on our team. it was clear to me the main EA was burned out. I tried to implement everyone taking a turn being on call every weekend, to make sure everyone was putting in their OT hours, to get everyone to copy the whole team on their tasks so we could back each other up properly, to name a few things. 

At first it was going ok, but now I find myself very, very frustrated with the dynamic. I had a chat with the two other dedicated EAs about how we can back each other up properly by being more communicative so no one has to work on their time off or when it isn’t their weekend, and was met with resistance from the exec’s main EA. 

In the last few weeks she has become incredibly icy to me and I am not sure what the catalyst was. I tried to go talk with her about if anything was bothering her and she says she doesn’t know what I am talking about. She has started handling things I was doing behind my back. We were VERY friendly up until the last month, I don’t know what changed. 

I am finding myself feeling fed up and like I am dealing with a nightmare situation. The dysfunction obviously starts at the top with the exec, but it’s like the main EA enables it. Because she is not communicative either, I have no idea what she does during the day (I know she stays busy) and I don’t know how I can help her. She no longer seems to want my help.

There is so much more that I am not detailing that has happened since I have started here. I think it’s probably time for me try and find something new, but the money is so appealing. I have a total of 5 years experience and not sure I could get something that pays the same. 

Looking to commiserate and for advice - anyone else deal with an exec and team like this? How did you handle it?",5,1764956847.0,ExecutiveAssistants,0,1.0,False

\[Show & Tell\] I'm an electrical engineering student.  I also love photography — specifically, I love Live Photos on my iPhone. Those 1. 5-second motion clips capture moments that still photos can't: my cat mid-pounce, friends bursting into laughter, waves crashing on rocks. The problem? My field runs on Windows. MATLAB, LTspice, Altium Designer, Cadence, Multisim — almost every EE tool requires Windows.  I can't switch to Mac for school.  But every time I transfer my photos to my laptop, the magic dies. My HEIC stills become orphaned files. The MOV motion clips scatter into random folders. Windows Photos app shows them as separate, unrelated files.  The ""Live"" part of Live Photo?  Gone. I searched everywhere for a solution. Stack Overflow.  Reddit. Apple forums. Nothing. Some suggested ""just use iCloud web"" — but it's painfully slow and requires constant internet. Others said ""convert to GIF"" — destroying quality and losing the original.  A few recommended paid software that wanted to import everything into proprietary databases, corrupting my folder structure in the process. So I spent 6 months building what I actually needed.

# How it works: Folder = Album

[https://github.com/OliverZhaohaibin/iPhotos-LocalPhotoAlbumManager](https://github.com/OliverZhaohaibin/iPhotos-LocalPhotoAlbumManager) **No database.  No import step. Every folder is an album.** The app uses lightweight `. iphoto. album. json` manifests to store your ""human decisions"" — cover photo, featured images, custom order.  Your original files are **never touched**. This means:

* ✅ You can browse your library with any file manager
* ✅ You can sync with any cloud service
* ✅ If my app dies tomorrow, your photos are still perfectly organized

# The killer feature: Live Photo pairing

The app automatically pairs your HEIC/JPG stills with their MOV motion clips using Apple's `ContentIdentifier` metadata. A ""LIVE"" badge appears — hover to play the motion inline, just like on your iPhone. **Finally, I can show my Live Photos on Windows.** **Technical details for the curious:**

    ExifTool extracts ContentIdentifier from HEIC/MOV
    Fallback: time-proximity matching (±1. 5s capture time)
    Paired assets stored in index.jsonl for instant reload

# I spent weeks reverse-engineering how Apple stores this metadata.  Turns out the ContentIdentifier is embedded in QuickTime atoms — ExifTool can read it, but you need to know exactly where to look.

# The performance nightmare that forced me into GPU programming

My first version did everything on CPU with pure Python + NumPy. It worked...  technically. Then I tried editing a 48MP photo. **Nearly 3 minutes to apply a single brightness adjustment.** I watched the progress bar crawl. I alt-tabbed. I made coffee. I came back.  Still processing. This was unacceptable. Photo editing needs to feel instant — you drag a slider, you see the result.  Not ""drag a slider, go make lunch."" I profiled the code. The bottleneck was clear: Python's GIL + CPU-bound pixel operations = death by a thousand loops.  Even with NumPy vectorization and Numba JIT compilation, I was hitting a wall.  A 48MP image is 48 million pixels. Each pixel needs multiple operations for exposure, contrast, saturation...  that's billions of calculations per adjustment. **So I rewrote the entire rendering pipeline in OpenGL 3.3.** Why OpenGL 3.3 specifically?

* ✅ **Maximum compatibility** — runs on integrated GPUs from 2012, no dedicated GPU required
* ✅ **Cross-platform** — same shaders work on Windows, macOS, Linux
* ✅ **Sufficient power** — for 2D image processing, I don't need Vulkan's complexity As a student, I know many of us run old ThinkPads or budget laptops. I needed something that works on a 10-year-old machine with Intel HD Graphics, not just RTX 4090s. The result? That same 48MP photo now renders adjustments in **under 16ms** — 60fps real-time preview.  Drag a slider, see it instantly. The way it should be. **The shader pipeline:**// Simplified version of the color grading shader uniform float u\_exposure; uniform float u\_contrast; uniform float u\_saturation; uniform mat3 u\_perspectiveMatrix; void main() { vec4 color = texture(u\_texture, transformedCoord); // Exposure (stops) color.rgb \*= pow(2.0, u\_exposure); // Contrast (pivot at 0.5) color.rgb = (color.rgb - 0.5) \* u\_contrast + 0.5; // Saturation (luminance-preserving) float luma = dot(color. rgb, vec3(0.299, 0.587, 0.114)); color. rgb = mix(vec3(luma), color.rgb, u\_saturation); gl\_FragColor = color; }

# All calculations happen on the GPU in parallel — millions of pixels processed simultaneously. The CPU just uploads uniforms and lets the GPU do what it's designed for.

# Non-destructive editing with real-time preview

The edit mode is fully non-destructive:

* **Light adjustments:** Brilliance, Exposure, Highlights, Shadows, Brightness, Contrast, Black Point
* **Color grading:** Saturation, Vibrance, White Balance
* **Black & White:** Intensity, Neutrals, Tone, Grain with artistic film presets
* **Perspective correction:** Vertical/horizontal keystoning, ±45° rotation
* **Black border prevention:** Geometric validation ensures no black pixels after transforms All edits are stored in `.ipo` sidecar files. Your originals stay untouched forever. **The math behind perspective correction:** I defined three coordinate systems: **Texture Space** — raw pixels from the source image **Projected Space** — after perspective matrix (where validation happens) **Screen Space** — for mouse interaction The crop box must be fully contained within the transformed quadrilateral. I use `point_in_convex_polygon` checks to prevent any black borders before applying the crop.

# Map view with GPS clustering

# Every photo with GPS metadata appears on an interactive map.  I built a custom MapLibre-style vector tile renderer in PySide6/Qt6 — no web view, pure OpenGL. Tiles are cached locally.  Reverse geocoding converts coordinates to human-readable locations (""Tokyo, Japan""). Perfect for reliving travel memories — see all photos from your trip plotted on an actual map.

# The architecture

    Backend (Pure Python, no GUI dependency):
    ├── models/     → Album, LiveGroup data structures
    ├── io/         → Scanner, metadata extraction
    ├── core/       → Live Photo pairing, image filters (NumPy → Numba JIT fallback)
    ├── cache/      → index.jsonl, file locking
    └── app. py      → Facade coordinating everything
    GUI (PySide6/Qt6):
    ├── facade.py   → Qt signals/slots bridge to backend
    ├── services/   → Async tasks (scan, import, move)
    ├── controllers/→ MVC pattern
    ├── widgets/    → Edit panels, map view
    └── gl_*/       → OpenGL renderers (image viewer, crop tool, perspective)

The backend is fully testable without any GUI. The GUI layer uses strict MVC — Controllers trigger actions, Models hold state, Widgets render. **Performance tier fallback:**

    GPU (OpenGL 3.3) → NumPy vectorized → Numba JIT → Pure Python
    ↑ preferred                      fallback →

# If your machine somehow doesn't support OpenGL 3.3, the app falls back to CPU processing. It'll be slow, but it'll work.

# Why I'm posting

Neither he nor the Giants have announced his role on his new team.

Marjama most recently was the hitting coach for the Triple-A Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, who won the Triple-A National Championship in 2025.

Marjama is a former player who had a brief cup of coffee with the Mariners as a catcher.  He grew up in Granite Bay and played at Sacramento State, and was a Giants fan, and talked about how excited he was in his post:

> “As a kid from Northern California, I grew up watching the greats of this historic franchise,” he wrote. “I spent countless hours mimicking their moves in neighborhood pickup games and sitting on the edge of my seat as Kruk [Mike Krukow] and Kuip [Duane Kuiper] called some of the best moments of my childhood.”

**My Speculation:** Due to the lack of an announcement from the team, I doubt he’ll be part of the big league dugout coaching crew.  I would expect he may be Sacramento’s new hitting coach, or very possibly a minor league coordinator of hitting in a system-wide role.",5,1764956821.0,SFGiants,1,1.0,False

1pf1jw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1pf1jw0/betterme_skandinavian_lifestyle/,BetterMe: Skandinavian Lifestyle,"Have you ever wondered why life in Scandinavia often seems … easier, calmer, happier? It’s not magic — it’s lifestyle. The Scandinavian approach blends simple daily habits, respect for nature, and meaningful routines.

**Core habits and values that shape this way of life:**

* **Pause and savour:** The idea of fika — a calm break often with coffee and a sweet — isn’t just about food, but about slowing down, connecting with yourself or others, and enjoying the moment. 
* **Nature is for everyone:** In countries like Sweden, Allemansrätten (“the right to roam”) means free access to forests, lakes and trails — so outdoor walks, hikes or even a quick forest stroll can be a normal weekend plan. 
* **Balance over extremes:** The principle Lagom — “not too much, not too little” — affects everything: how people work, spend, consume, even how they eat or design their homes. It’s about finding the middle ground that feels sustainable and satisfying. 
* **Modesty and community:** Social trust, equality, humility (captured by the idea of Jantelagen) create an environment where people prioritize collective well-being over individual show-off.
* **Seasonal rhythm & embracing both sun and snow:** Summers bring sunny, active days out; winters become cosy and slow — think warm drinks, quiet nights, home comfort. Every season has its own rhythm and rituals.

❔❔ What Scandinavian habit would you be willing to try for a month — and why?

These are all the following signs he is romantically or sexually interested in me: 

• he told me that he thinks I’m witty and attractive (called me a catch and wife material) when I confided in him about feeling bad after a breakup
	•	he has said several times that he likes when I stop by his office to talk
	•	he remembered my birthday
	•	he has initiated that I should join him for walks during lunch
	•	he asks a lot of questions about me and seems curious in who I am as a person
	•	he paid for an item I was going to buy when we were in a store together, without me asking
	•	he gave me his private phone number
	•	he gave me his sweater when I said I was cold
	•	he gently took hold of my arm when I accidentally stood in the way of someone passing by
	•	he has on several occasions taken the initiative for us to meet outside of work (for example inviting me to join him for different activities)
	•	during one conversation we happened to get into a discussion about sexual relationships and dating, and he didn’t steer the conversation away. He also said something like “as long as the person is an adult and consents” when talking about his own sex life, instead of mentioning that the person should be around his own age
	•	what goes against all of this is that he refers to me as his friend, and that he is 23 years older than me. He is also very friendly to people in general

Since he gave me his phone number, i texted and asked him if he wanted to grab a coffee after work sometime, and he said “beautiful [my name]. Of course i want to”. And also gave this saturday as a suggestion despite me saying i want to meet after work (probably because he doesn’t want coworkers to see us leaving together). So it definitely goes beyond just a friendly coworker situation. But i don’t know how to proceed after this. I do think he is attractive but i don’t want a relationship (as in boyfriend and girlfriend) because it’ll be too complicated. I’m probably just sexually curious and flattered he’s taking an interest in me. I don’t know if i’m being stupid and naive. Please help me.

Try watching and reading anything from before at least the '70s and not find a scene of a man putting his wife over his knee and beating her for being 'difficult' or having, god forbid, an opinion.

Feminists fought hard to free women from the cultural reality depicted in the ads above. (Sabrina Carpenter's album cover has been posted a million times, but it's relevant for comparison.)  
  
To make sure future generations would not be held to the shackles of subservience to and domination from men they and their grandmothers had no choice but to endure.

Only for a whole generation of younger women to turn around and claim that 'submission' is *real* empowerment, that anyone critical of BDSM and violent kinks is anti-feminist and denying women the 'agency' to make their own choices.

Proudly posing with the black eyes and bruises men have given them during 'rough' sex and bragging about how much abuse they can take in the bedroom. 'Dark romance' books glorifying sexual violence and degradation from domineering, sadistic men.  
  
BDSM is cool and edgy, while anything 'vanilla' is of course derided as boooring and for squares. Any criticism of or critical analysis on why someone would want to be beaten and degraded dismissed as sex-negative 'purity culture'.

You know what I'm saying; I'm sure you've all asked yourself the same *""Am I just screaming into a void?""* question a time or two. I know I ask myself that several times a day.

It's natural to presume that nobody actually read your post. Other content is constantly available and it's easy to get lost among it all. 

But there is also the very real chance that people read your post and simply don't like it. It doesn't speak to them in any significant way. Or worse, they just don't like what you wrote.

I post to our subreddit nearly every day. It's the first thing on my mind after I have my first cup of coffee each morning. What can I put up on our sub that will interest and hopefully engage our community?

I am sincerely devoted to the trans community, especially the one here in Michigan. A few years back I noted the lack of collegiality and cooperation among trans individuals in our state. And it really bothered me.

That pique led to the creation of this subreddit, r/MI_transgender_friend . I envisioned an online safe space for the trans community here in Michigan, on which people could meet others in our community, express their concerns, celebrate their successes, and just be themselves, without judgment or criticism. 

To a certain extent, that goal has been achieved. We have been blessed with continual growth. I honestly hoped we might attract 100 members to this group. As of this morning, we now have over 940. Amazing!

But, I truly don't know what more I can do--what this subreddit can do--to make it more useful to YOU.

If you've been paying attention, we have encouraged members to introduce themselves, hence, Introduction Monday. After an initial spurt of activity, though, that day has simply fallen back to being just the first day of the week. With hundreds of members, the logical question is *""Why?""*

We have also put forward the prospect of group gatherings and store takeovers. Neither of which has drawn much interest. Once again I have to ask, *""Why?""*

Rest assured--nobody moderating this sub is gaining anything from doing so other than the satisfaction of serving our community. We all have ""real life"" careers and lives outside the confines of this space. I can't thank **Aubrey** and **Rachel** enough for agreeing to co-moderate. Their presence and posts have brought a fresh vitality to this sub that was lacking when it was just me overseeing it. They are the best!

But tell us: What more can we do? What can we do to get you to participate more in this subreddit? What would spark your interest and get YOU to post? What do you want to see on this subreddit?

I really don't like talking to myself. And it creeps out anyone who sees me doing it.

But just now over coffee I was talking to a colleague and he told me we had to use all our holidays before the end of the year. It was my understanding that you accumulate the holidays for the next year. So you work 2025 to use them in 2026 and during 2025 I can use what I accumulated thus far.

Otherwise if we need to use them in the same year, then that means that if for example I wanted to take long holidays in April, given the 2.5 days per month, I could only take 7.5 days and not 2-3 weeks (10-15 days). Which was what I was planning as I wanted to travel abroad and wanted to avoid the summer season.

I hope this isn't the case in my company. I have almost 20 days from the full year, it's my first year working in France. I only took a few here and there for appointments. I remember at the beginning of the year my manager and colleague saying how many holidays they had left from last year to use in 2025.

Wanted to share the utter TRAGEDY 🎭 that has happened tonight. 

In this cold winter night, I decided that I deserved a good treat. I was tired hungry it was cold outside and raining. 

I popped down to the shops and went the aisle of my number 1 weakness. Fruit juices and cake. Gosh I was CRAZY that purple fizz I can’t resist  the taste of a fizzy grape drink. 

I grapes the following without looking 
3 purple drinks 
One mini box cake (from Sainsbury my UK folk know that coffee cake is delicious) 
and a back of yummies 


I was READY, move night was in. 
I’m really good at calculating my insulin by eye. I took my blood sugar first, it was 7.0 ( 126 mg/dL) a little high, but I ate pancakes today and didn’t take my insulin so that nots bad. 

Anyways, I give myself about 20 units of insulin … and was ready to chug that purple sugar water 🤣. 

Only to find out EVERY bottle I bought was SUGAR FREE. I nearly collapsed 🥲 

Wanted to trauma dump with everyone 😂 while I try get my blood sugar up.

https://preview.redd.it/589z1gw76f5g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=29adeeb57fbf529d0b26d83b3286f1812161dda6

The photo on the left was taken right around the time I hit rock bottom. I'd just been mistaken for my daughter's grandmother at her wedding. The photographer looked directly at me standing next to my 29-year-old daughter and asked where the mother of the bride was.

I was 56.

I'd been running on empty for months. Caring for my mother through her final weeks. Working overtime. Helping Emily plan everything. Surviving on four hours of sleep and coffee. I knew I wasn't looking my best but hearing that out loud in front of everyone was a different kind of pain.

I made it through the ceremony. Smiled when I had to. But during cocktail hour I found a quiet hallway near the coat room and completely fell apart. Missed the father-daughter dance because I couldn't stop crying.

That night in my hotel room I forced myself to really look in the mirror. The deep grooves between my eyebrows. The hollowed out darkness under my eyes. My jawline melting into my neck. I finally saw what that photographer saw.

Three weeks later I was sitting at my kitchen table researching home equity loans. Trying to figure out if I could borrow against my house to afford the $27,400 facelift three different surgeons had quoted me. That's how far gone I was mentally.

Then my college roommate Jessica called. She writes for a medical research journal and had heard about the wedding from Emily. She told me to stop everything because she'd just interviewed a biochemist named Dr. Hana Lee who'd developed something with real clinical data behind it. 847 women tested. 73% saw visible wrinkle reduction in 28 days. She wanted to send me a bottle.

I told her I was done being disappointed by miracle creams. She said just try it. If it doesn't work I could still get the surgery.

I didn't believe it would do anything but I was too desperate to say no.

https://preview.redd.it/4oh02x9b6f5g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=437f77a03e6fa307cdc466ea342c9c838d9624f4

The photo on the right is 28 days later.

First morning after using it I woke up and looked in the mirror and actually gasped loud enough that my husband Tom came running thinking I'd fallen. The deep grooves had softened. The hollowness under my eyes looked fuller. My skin had this glow I hadn't seen in years.

By week two the crow's feet around my eyes started fading. I stopped wearing concealer for the first time since my 40s. Week three Tom noticed my jawline was actually lifting. Week four I stopped hiding under heavy foundation because I actually wanted people to see my skin.

My own sister didn't believe it wasn't surgical until I showed her the bottle. She ordered two on the spot.

Now when I'm out with Emily people assume we're sisters. The photographer who called me a grandmother actually contacted me through the wedding planner asking if I'd model for his campaign. He had no idea I was the same woman.

But what matters most is when I look in the mirror now I recognize myself again. Not some 25-year-old fantasy. Just me. The woman I still feel like inside.

1pf1a15,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1pf1a15/types_of_sewing_threads_explained_a_beginners/,Types of Sewing Threads Explained: A Beginner’s Guide,"If you’re stepping into the world of sewing, one of the first things you’ll realize is that **threads are not all the same**. Walk into any craft store or browse online sewing supplies, and you'll find cotton, silk, polyester, bonded nylon, metallic threads, quilting threads… the list goes on. Each thread has a different personality — some are soft and subtle, some are strong and bold, and some shimmer like a decorative jewel on fabric.

Yet many beginners (and even experienced sewists!) often ask:

*""Does the thread type really matter?""*

Absolutely. Choosing the right thread can be the difference between a garment that lasts for years and one that frays the moment you stretch it. So, let’s break down the most common types of threads, when to use them, and how to choose the perfect one for your sewing project — in a simple, friendly, and helpful guide.

Get comfortable, grab a cup of coffee and let's dive in!

# Why Understanding Thread Types Really Matters

Think of thread as the *quiet hero* of sewing. It is what holds your creative vision together — literally. A beautiful fabric with the wrong thread can lead to:

* Loose or skipped stitches
* Thread breakage while sewing
* Puckering seams
* Colors fading after washing
* Weak joins that tear easily

When you understand how different threads behave, you sew with more confidence and get professional-looking results even as a beginner.

**1. Cotton Thread**

[Cotton thread](https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts) is a classic. It’s natural, soft, and easy to sew with, especially for **lightweight fabrics**.

**Best For**

✔ Quilting  
✔ Lightweight woven fabrics  
✔ Natural fibers like cotton & linen  
✔ General stitching and seams

**Why Sewists Love It**

* Minimal stretch — perfect for crisp, flat seams
* Takes dye well, so colors look rich
* Great for topstitching and patchwork

**Keep in Mind**

Avoid using cotton thread on stretchy fabrics as it can snap under pressure. It’s strong, but not elastic.

If you plan to stitch pure cotton fabric like shirts or cushion covers, cotton thread blends beautifully and gives a soft finish.

 **2. Polyester Thread**

One of the most **versatile threads** available. Polyester thread works with almost anything — a true all-rounder for beginners.

**Best For**

✔ Most everyday sewing projects  
✔ Knits & stretch fabrics  
✔ Clothing construction  
✔ Machine sewing

**Why It’s Popular**

* Slight elasticity (won’t break easily)
* Resistant to shrinkage
* Strong but not stiff
* Affordable and widely available

**A Quick Tip**

If you’re confused, choose polyester — it’s usually a safe bet. It also glides well through sewing machines without linting too much.

**3. Cotton-Wrapped Polyester Thread**

A beautiful hybrid thread — polyester at the core for strength, wrapped in cotton for a natural finish.

**Best For**

✔ Everyday garments  
✔ Quilting  
✔ Home decor  
✔ Seam stitching

**Why It Stands Out**

* Strong + smooth sewing experience
* Looks natural like cotton
* Flexible for machine stitching

You’ll find many ready-to-use sewing kits packed with this blend because it combines the best of both worlds.

**4. Silk Thread**

Elegant, luxurious, and smooth like butter — silk thread is used in premium projects.

**Best For**

✔ Bridal wear & couture garments  
✔ Fine delicate fabrics  
✔ Hand finishing & appliqué  
✔ Embroidery

**Why People Love It**

* Almost invisible on fabric
* Glides beautifully without snagging
* Perfect for delicate hand-stitching

**Worth Noting**

Silk thread is more expensive than cotton or polyester, so it's usually reserved for special projects. But if you ever sew silk sarees, lehengas, or formal gowns — this thread will feel like magic in your hands.

**5. Nylon Thread**

Strong and durable — nylon thread is the go-to option when sewing **heavy-duty materials**.

**Best For**

✔ Leatherwork  
✔ Bags & backpacks  
✔ Outdoor gear  
✔ Shoes & upholstery

**Strength Factor**

Bonded nylon versions are extra tough and resistant to abrasion. Great for projects that need to *survive real life* — think rain, weight, and movement.

**6. Heavy-Duty Thread**

When basic thread just isn't enough.

**Best For**

✔ Denim & jeans  
✔ Canvas  
✔ Jackets  
✔ Repair work

Heavy-duty threads often come thicker than standard threads, so remember to use the correct needle (usually topstitch/jeans needle).

**7. Embroidery Threads**

These are made to **shine, decorate, and impress**.

**Types include:**

* **Rayon thread** – glossy, popular for machine embroidery
* **Polyester embroidery thread** – fade-resistant
* **Metallic thread** – sparkly and decorative

**Best For**

✔ Monograms  
✔ Decorative stitches  
✔ Embellishments on kurti, saree, tops  
✔ Craft projects

Embroidery thread gives your design life — whether you're creating floral motifs or personalizing clothing.

**8. Quilting Thread**

Designed specifically for quilting layers together.

**Best For**

✔ Quilting projects  
✔ Patchwork  
✔ Blanket stitching

Available in cotton or polyester, quilting threads are strong enough to hold layers but soft enough to let the quilt drape naturally.

**9. Invisible or Monofilament Thread**

Clear and thin — looks like fishing line.

**Best For**

✔ Invisible hems  
✔ Attaching trims & lace  
✔ Projects requiring subtle stitching

Tip: Use a low heat setting while ironing to prevent melting.

**10. Woolly Nylon Thread**

A fluffy, stretchy, soft thread.

**Best For**

✔ Sergers/overlock machines  
✔ Swimwear & activewear  
✔ Stretch fabric hems  
✔ Rolled edges

It beautifully fills the seam for soft edges — perfect for kids’ clothing where comfort matters.

 

# How to Choose the Right Thread — A Simple Guide

||
||
|**Project Type**|**Best Thread to Use**|
|Everyday clothing|Polyester or cotton-wrapped polyester|
|Quilting|Cotton or quilting thread|
|Denim/Heavy fabric|Heavy-duty or nylon|
|Stretch fabric|Polyester or woolly nylon|
|Silk/Delicate fabrics|Silk thread|
|Decorative designs|Embroidery thread|

**Quick rule:**

**Match your thread to your fabric and purpose.**

 

# Thread Weight, Ply & Strength — What Do They Mean?

You’ll see numbers like 30wt, 50wt, or “2-ply” on thread spools. This confuses many beginners, so here’s the shortcut:

* **Lower weight number = thicker thread** (30wt is thicker than 50wt)
* **Higher weight number = finer thread** (ideal for delicate stitching)
* **Ply indicates strands twisted together — more ply = stronger thread**

No math required — just remember thick for heavy fabrics, thin for delicate ones!

 

**Color Matters More Than We Think**

Should the thread match or contrast?

* If you want seams to **blend**, match the fabric shade closely.
* For bold topstitching on denim or bags, **contrast colors pop beautifully**.
* In doubt, choose a slightly darker shade — it blends better than lighter.

Small detail, big difference in the final look.

 

# Where Can You Buy Sewing Threads?

You can find a wide range of threads in local craft shops, sewing supply stores, or online marketplaces. Many beginners enjoy browsing [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) or TrueGether where vintage, specialty, and bulk thread bundles often appear at good prices — especially if you want to experiment without spending too much. Compare sellers, read reviews, and look for quality brands for best results.

(Avoid extremely cheap threads with fuzz — they break quickly and cause frustration.)

 

# Tips for Storing Thread (Most People Forget This!)

* Keep threads away from direct sunlight — color fades
* Store spools upright to avoid tangles
* Use airtight boxes to prevent moisture
* If thread feels dry or brittle, replace — old thread breaks easily

A little care extends the life of your supplies.

 

# Final Thoughts

Thread is not just a material — it’s the invisible force that holds creativity together. From soft cotton for comfy summer dresses to shimmering embroidery threads that turn fabric into art, each type has its own charm and purpose. Once you understand how threads differ, you’ll start choosing them intentionally instead of just grabbing whatever is available — and that’s when your sewing skill really levels up.

Whether you’re repairing a shirt, quilting a blanket, or designing a bag, the right thread will make your work last longer and look more professional.

So explore, experiment, feel the textures, compare the sheen, and play with colors — the world of sewing becomes so much more fun when you know your threads.

1pf19f1,https://i.redd.it/7jpeaapf8f5g1.jpeg,Comfort & Joy: My December Capsule,"My capsule this month is basically a commitment to wearing my BPAL Yules from last year while I wait for this year's to ship haha~ For the most part I'm a ""Christmas stuff belongs in December *only*"" guy, so this is really the only time of year it feels like to dip into these blends. Besides that, the only other ""themes"" are liturgical incense (because I have to take *something* from my Catholic upbringing) & matcha (to celebrate the two beautiful matcha scents I acquired recently). Let's get into the line-up!

*BPAL*
- **Porcelain Krumpus**: Brown leather and a bundle of switches encased in pale white orris root and rice powder, translucent white musk, Himalayan ﻿ambrette seed, and milky vanilla.
- **Eighteenth Lash**: Vanillekipferl plunked in a pile ﻿of pine needles.
    - These previous two fit together in such a fun way! I wish I had gotten more lashes to compare the various combinations, but I'm very happy with these! Pine notes can be tricky for me, but this one is very gentle & nestles into the vanilla so delicately.
- **Pomegranate Ink**: Notes in name.
    - There's just something so sophisticated about this scent despite how simple it is. The scent evokes black & red in such vivid detail, it's impossible to pass up as a Gothic Christmas masterpiece. I feel at home in it's dark simplicity.
- **Faunalia**: The scent of a thick, starlit, unspoiled forest, with a burst of wild musk﻿, opobalsamum, black bryony, mandragora, and hemlock.
    - Not pictured because I took this photo in a flurry before work & forgot to grab it haha! This perfume is not my usual type of earthiness, but I'm determined to learn to love it this year!
- **Vintage Wise Man Blow Mold**: A sun-faded plasticky shell of lemony gold, frankincense, and myrrh, illuminated from within by 40 watts of glowing amber.
    - Got this one in an out-of-season destash so it hasn't had a chance to shine yet! All those notes are right up my alley tho~
- **Please Scream**: A heap of warm spiced funnel cakes with a scoo﻿p of coffee ice cream.
    - This was a last-minute addition & doesn't really fit the rest of the themeing, but it can be a great comfort in the midst of holiday crisis so it got included anyway!

*PULP*
- **Vaniglia Grave**: Liturgical incense & smoked vanilla.
    - This was the only scent I got from the Vaniglia series. It was a blind buy & I have absolutely no regrets. There's something so comforting about how the smoke & vanilla play off each other.

*BRIIX*
- **Matchatopia**: Matcha powder, mate absolute, vanilla ice cream, tonka bean, white musk.
    - Ice cream in December? When it smells this good? Absolutely! I still can't believe the notes don't mention a waffle cone because I swear I smell it so clearly! Regardless, I'm so glad I took a chance on this house~

*WICK WISH*
- **Lucky Cat**: Matcha latte, jasmine, almond blossom, musk, sandalwood.
    - Also not pictured because I hadn't actually tried this on before I took the picture, but once I did I just had to include it!

I know at one point I mentioned wanting to include Snake Oil in this line up, but I think I already have more than enough to go around at this point. We'll save that for January, maybe! I do have a bottle of the hair gloss on the way, so I can't put it on hold for too long.

Thanks again to u/lemony-soapwater for pulling me into this fun little project! It's been really cool seeing what people put together & I appreciate how it's helping me be more intentional about how I interact with my growing collection!

i can describe a temporary but recurring mismatch that has been happening in our lives for most of our time living together 1.5 years. it is a bit scary and frustrating and i would appreciate input about whether we could soften the cycle or find ways that it doesn't hurt as bad.

i am 29M full time laborer making a low wage, and in general i am an energetic extrovert, i do most of the chores at home, i get out of bed quickly and easily, and i am emotionally labile--i accept things out of my hands quickly, i move on, and i do not rigidly attach to things or situations. i drink a lot of water and eat a balanced diet mostly cooked from scratch--but i don't nice eating junk food sometimes, even though it doesn't feel nourishing. i don't crave any food groups in particular but i have a good balance of whole grains, beans, brown bread, protein, and vegetable.

she is 28F full time receptionist making a moderate wage, she is generally melancholic, prone to inertness, she has more tastes and specific preferences for food and decor, she likes treats and junk food a little more, and always craves vegetables as well as sweets.

i perceive the cycle in this way: i wake up and drink a lot of instant coffee (3-4 servings) to prepare for work. at work i can keep up with tasks fine, but i am in cold and uncomfortable conditions and i gradually drain my energy by the end of the day. at that point, i can barely keep my mind on a conversation and i can barely keep on task making dinner etc. so at this time at end of the day, i like to drink alcohol or vape marijuana bc it helps calm down my mind and get me to maintain a train of thought, turn a bit inward for reflection, and get ready to move to the next day.

at her work, she doesn't need to worry about maintaining her energy, but rather her attitude. interactions with patients and coworkers can occasionally be highly triggering, and several times a day she already talks herself down from getting an anxious trigger about others' behavior. at the end of the day, she likes to tell me everything that happened and how frustrating or stupid each person was. most days we have a good time talking about it together, but sometimes, she sees things differently and gets triggered, saying things like i never help her, our relationship is over/empty, theres no point to our lives.

sometimes when she gets into this mindset i can gradually talk her down from it. but sometimes i can't, and she goes to bed mad and wakes up mad. even if i succeed 9/10 times, any time i can't help or any time she pushes me away, her heart closes to me, she genuinely believes our relationship is over, and she cares nothing for the shared apartment costs and the material support we have put in place for ourselves, she would rather not eat, not sleep, than to admit that even though things feel uncomfortable we still have everything we need.

most of the time we just sort of move on after a few days of hardship, and as far as i can tell this is a sustainable arrangement. but some times the things she says almost convince me that she wants to leave. she believes that if we're not aspiring to ""improve ourselves"" every day, we're not living a life worth living--and me, i don't exactly know that ""improvement"" means, but i do think any changes likely take days and days to play out, not always something you can watch.

i can tell our cycles are not quite aligned but i want to be able to manage it better, with consideration for both of our patterns. ",1,1764955978.0,ChineseMedicine,1,1.0,False

There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

I have been in a mutually committed heterosexual relationship now with someone (31M) for a year and about 3 months now. I’m (28F) ruminating on something they said yesterday during a conversation/argument. I asked what efforts they wanted me to do for the sake of the relationship. They went back to say something they had mentioned to me before: styling my clothes more pleasantly for daily outings that could include their presence. From the times they’ve mentioned it before I’ve come to understand they mean not wearing leggings nor sweatpants equivalents. We live together in a place with cold winters, or at least cold to me as I was born and raised with tropical climates of days with 30 degree Celsius on average. They do not mind my winter pijamas or indoor house clothes as much as clothes that I wear when I go outside with him for coffee and lunch and such. Yesterday when he brought up this idea for “efforts” again I responded saying that was something he could do as well. They work from home every single day and their daily look includes sweatpants and a nice sweater for occasional zoom calls. They have also grown comfortable wearing the same sweatpants they sleep on out on quick grocery runs. I do not actually mind this at all. I simply said that in response because it irks me they don’t see the double standard of their argument on clothes we each wear and why we wear them and how. My man also always has an answer for everything so when I said that he said “well you should help me pick my clothes better also I never know any of that stuff you know that, that’s what couples do you know, compromise” If I have to “dress myself better” since he’s asking for me to do so, and if I’m asking the same thing in return of him but ALSO have to pick said clothes for him, how is that a compromise since there is more for me to do than him? Am I just stupid and that is in fact a compromise? It’s not even that I’m hoping to have someone be on my side of this matter I just genuinely can’t seem to understand how that is a “compromise” for the both of us instead of an added advantage for him?",1,1764955891.0,AITA_Relationships,4,0.67,False

Man I just feel empty now. Do saalo se kisise dhang se baat nahi kari hai. Shit gets lonely bruh. Academics bhi chude hue hai cause i chose a bad coaching. Bc bas padhta rehta hu i dont have anything else on my mind. Today after months i stepped out of my house and went alone on a 45 walk to refresh myself but couldn't think of anything other than syllabus completion and anxiety. Mera toh abhi tak syllabus bhi nahi complete hua aur QFT-1 mai shit score aaya.

Kal mai bimar tha so I couldn't study and that's when I realised kitne mahino se gaming nahi kiya movies nahi dekhi, anime nahi dekha, koi mast book nahi padhi, badminton nahi khela, dosto ke saath walk pe nahi gaya, uno nahi khela, cousins ke saath timepass nhai kiya, dosto ke saath bakchodi nahi kari, late tak jaga nahi, subha late utha nahi, etc etc.

Dopamine hits milne ke liye ab I've started drinking a lot of coffee and eating junk food cause that's legit the only shit making me happy now (don't even feel like doing m*thi cause it feels like a waste of time). Fat bohot badh gaya hai and this is the shittiest I've ever been physically.

Upar se mera shitass coaching jisme na hi exams hote hai na hi syllabus completion. I have no juniors who'd look up to me, no seniors to look up to, no classmates to compete with. When I was at the end of tenth and wanted to join Allen I tried so hard to convince my parents that this coaching wouldn't get me anywhere but they told me to have trust. Well, I guess that trust hasn't gotten me shit now 🤡🤡🤡. This place fucking wasted my money, my potential, my mental health and whatnot. Seems like I'm the only one here who was serious since the beginning of eleventh and guess what that got me? JACKSHIT!!!!!

My friend group is more studious than average and it hurts so bad to see ur friends doing better than u knowing that ur better and more hardworking than them man. They're in actual coachings and have better friends who they see as competition. To them I'm just a spec who's rank won't affect them. It fucking sucks man. The same mfs you'd challenge in tenth grade now don't even consider you as competition, when it's not even your fualt that you're fucked up and you know very well that you would've zoomed past them had you been provided the same guidance as them.

I know it sounds corny but I legit feel like a cheetah held in a small cage. I'm dying to prove myself out there. Istg had I been given one opportunity to prove myself I would've done much better than the same mfs who laugh at me.

I've started to forget social interaction and I can't have a decent conversation with anyone without stuttering :(((((((((((. So I just avoid talking to anyone cause I can't talk about anything other than academics/syllabus cause nothing else is on my mind rn. Bc khud ke maa baap se samajhta nahi hai kya bolu. Kyuki ek toh padhai ke alava samajhta nahi hai kya bolu, and when I find a topic, I literally have trouble speaking cause I've forgotten how social interaction fucking works man.

Upar se eleventh mai thode ghar pe health issues hue the which led to financial issues and my mental health getting fucked up even more cause I have no one to talk to about this shit. I don't have nay siblings and as I said I haven't seen my ""friends"" in ages. And obviuosly I am not gonna talk about ts to my parents 🥀🥀🥀.

I'm pretty sure that in around march/april 2025 I was extremely depressed which is reflected in my timings on ypt app (I was averaging 2:20 per day, with some days less than an hour). I'm also pretty sure that from around August-October 2025 I was having either panic attacks or anxiety attacks (my body heat would increase, I would feel uneasiness in my stomach, I would start sweating, getting hiccups, my mind would get very very very foggy and I would just feel like shit for a few minutes and then it would all go away as if it never happened). abhi bhi ye kabhi kabhi hota hai but definetely the frequency has gone down a lot :))))).

***TLDR***: mental, physical and emotional health fucked up due to a shitty coaching, fucked up academics and fucked up social/personal life. prolly a hikikomori and incel.





I've vented many times on Reddit and istg this subreddit is the only shit keeping me sane love u all pookies gn and take care y'all ❤️❤️❤️❤️

This is the happiest day of my life, and all I did was HIIT cardio for 6 fucking hours to get this weight off of my back. 

Fuck my family. They are fucked in the head. Goodbye forever, go to the fucking quack psych and get some nice drugs. That's all I have to fucking say to them. Fuck you forever. You're in hell and your child does not love you. You have given your child failure to thrive. You are disgusting wastes that sexualized a child and wanted a little girl to be raped into a mother just like you. Fuck you. I'm a man. Their little fantasy was that I would run off with a boy and get raped. Instead I turned into a rapey young man.I HAVE NO experience with male friendships and I'm only learning. Other men are like this too I am unavailable for SECx with women. 

 Oh, D, it's just a little story 111 you're just a little girl and we'll give you some nice medicine and then you'll be a mommy just like me 1111999

Fuck doctor's. You have to beat your fucking doctor. I'm my own doctor and I just have a ba.  I will be a fucking doctor one day and I'm making sure nobody fucking mentally rapes young people ever again. This is my fucking life mission. 

Among other things, like maybe having a koi pond. I'm building a beautiful tank for a betta fish to enjoy, and so many people just want to throw the book at me. Oh no it has to be x gallons 111 well maybe I'll just have the fish for a bit before I give it to a fish keeper and then get some little shrimp. 

I'm walking backwards because of these mothers-in-law. I legally cut them off but they don't know the law. I didn't emancipate, you little fucking TARDS. You called me that. Oh no he's a TARD. A FUCKTARD. YOU'RE THE FUCKING FAGGOTS I'M SHAKING OFF MY BACK. I ENTERED THE SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU FUCKING FAILED YOU FUCKING RETARDED PEOPLE 1111

Anyways I'm fine. One time in therapy my fucking gamgam just talked about how I make coffee the wrong way. Fucking demented stupid ass kike. Fuck kosher. I'm not your little dancing jew girl. I'm a fucking goy homeless man. 

I will not be carrying your genes into the next generation. I'm a MSMwiWSWwiM.   I'm mourning for death himself to carry me away and I got my wish because you just kicked me to the curb and let me die. And you are fucking in the throes of dementia and I am the prince of hell Lucifer himself. You will only remember me vaguely when you die. You make me farsighted and I put on the glasses to make my vision worse. Oh no. What happened to your big doe eyes 999 

You raped a baby in the head. Abortion is a fucking crime against humanity, but RAPE is worse. My father wanted to RAPE ME IN A WHITE VAN. I WAS A BLOATED CORPSE. 

Thank you to medical science for allowing me to become the man I always was inside. This has nothing to do with a penis. It has to do with being a MAN. And I'm only 23 so I'm just a baby. 

Fuck you. I do not care when or if you die, and my spoils are my own. I taught myself everything. I taught you how to fucking do things. Children are so smart. 

I am a Nintendo nerd. I identify with the animal crossing character Wolfgang. Whatever. I'm just a silly guy, and I had to force this on the world. I had to revolutize the world RGU style in my own head. Doctor's re cognized me as a celibate male and thought there was already something wrong. There was. The crying was mental rape.

It usually follows the 1,2,3, secondary item pattern with a few exceptions. Sometimes 2,2,3 I feel like every 3 turns. Not 100% sure. 

Fruit: cherry/stawberry, strawberry, apple, sesame seed
Vegetable: tomato/cucumber, cucumber, asparagus, lettuce 
Protein: bacon/sausage, sausage, ham, egg
Alcohol: rice wine/beer, beer, red wine, brandy

Drinks: water, water, coffee bean, water, sparkling water, cola, ice, ice (sometimes I only receive 1 ice and the pattern resets when I submit an order, idk why it resets yet)

Seafood: fish, shellfish, fish, shellfish, fish, shellfish, mackerel (mackerel signals a reset and only occurs when there will be double fish), squid, shellfish, squid, shellfish, mackerel (double fish incoming), mackerel/squid, then shellfish

Hey guys,

I had a mini-revelation a few days ago,

About me, shortly, always been overweight, and never really cared about my health, I would eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted, drinking about 5 cups of coffee every day, staying up late and regularly sleeping between 4-6 hours (sleeping more than 6.5 hours was simply not a thing)

I started this last attempt at losing weight about 8 months ago, and decided that this time I will do it in an healthy way

So at first I started by limiting my calories to 2000 calories

Then after a few weeks I decided to get things sped up and started regularly going to the gym, 3 strength building and 2 cardio sessions a week

Then I started mandating at least 120g of protein a day (aiming for 150g, but I am a sane person and this is an insane goal)

And finally, a few months in, I started sleeping at 10am and waking up at 6am (every single day, no exceptions other than Friday \[Jewish, can't escape Friday's meal lol\])

So a few days ago I got this new shiny game that got me hooked instantly, and ended up allowing myself to skip a gym, session, and staying up to 1am, I didn't feel like cooking anything so I just heat up some fatty and precooked vegan schnitzels for dinner, and later on ordered in some hummus 

I woke up the next day, at about 6am (figured out that the damage of breaking out the routine and sleeping in, would be bigger than the damage of missing sleep), feeling like complete shit, I didn't want to do anything, I was sleepy all day, I had to force myself to go to college, and didn't study a thing there

Then when I went to the gym I could barely lift my normal weights for half of the reps I regularly do, and forget about cardio, I am already coughing for air after 3 minutes on the elliptical

And this is just insane to me, because this is how I lived my entire life, eating unhealthy, staying up late, and missing sleep, nothing was different that day than any other day in my entire life prior to starting this, except that now I know how being healthy feels like",19,1764955491.0,loseit,2,0.88,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **La Liga Showdown: Oviedo vs. Mallorca – A Battle of Bottom-Dwellers with a Twist**

The stage is set for a clash of La Liga’s also-rans as **Real Oviedo** and **Mallorca** collide on December 5, 2025, in a match that’s less about glory and more about avoiding the embarrassment of a relegation plunge. Let’s dissect this match with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Underdogs

The bookmakers have thrown us a curveball. On paper, **Oviedo** is the slight favorite in the head-to-head market, with odds hovering around **2.5 to 2.6** (implied probability: \~40%). **Mallorca**, meanwhile, is priced at **3.0 to 3.16** (implied probability: \~32-33%), while the draw sits at **2.8 to 3.0** (\~33-35%). But here’s the twist: the **spread market** tells a different story. Oviedo is a narrow favorite at **1.77 to 1.81** for a 0-point line, while Mallorca’s spread odds are **2.04 to 2.10**. That means if you’re betting on Mallorca to cover the spread (i.e., win or not lose by more than a goal), they’re actually offering better value than the H2H suggests.

In layman’s terms: Oviedo is the “favorite” in name only. The market smells a potential upset, and Mallorca’s spread odds hint at a team primed to defy expectations.

### Digest the News: Struggles, Managerial Shenanigans, and a Cup Loss

**Real Oviedo** is the La Liga version of a student who aced the entrance exam but forgot to study for the real thing. A newly promoted team, they’ve floundered with just two wins and nine points, despite a midseason managerial switch from **Paunović** to **Carrion**. Their recent 2-4 cup loss to Ourense? A reminder that even in a competition where the stakes are lower, they’re still tripping over their own shoelaces. But silver linings: They’re fresh, having avoided midweek fixtures, and their home crowd might just chant “*¡Vamos, novatos!*” (Go, rookies!) with the enthusiasm of a toddler at a playground.

**Mallorca**, on the other hand, is the “has-been” of this matchup. Once a team that reached the cup final under **Aguirre**, they’re now a shadow of their former selves under **Aragones**, with a win rate so low it’d make a sloth envious. They’ve lost half their matches this season, averaging less than one point per game, and currently sit perilously close to the relegation zone. But here’s

1pf0vgh,https://v.redd.it/zpeg2fbl5f5g1,17 pounds in 1 month! On a Tirzepatide Compound with Lupus!,"I started my journey on my Tirzepatide compound at 256 pounds, my heaviest weight yet (Im 5'4).
I'd been watching this Youtuber for about 6 months and she had been on a Tirzepatide Compound for a few months and was losing weight consistantly, she was able to reach her goal of 60 pounds lost in 6 months! So that really inspired me to give it a try, especially since every diet I'd ever tried never worked, I would always lose 5 to 10 pounds, maybe 15 if I'm lucky and then gain it all back eventually and some extra sometimes lol.
I was scared to take this type of drug because I'm not a diabetic and plus I'm currently dealing with an autoimmune disorder that I learned i had 2 years ago,  lupus (plus rheumatoid arthritis), so my mind was telling me you're already taking medicine, and you already have stuff going on, you don't want to make it any worse or add anything new, that all comes from lack of being educated on the medicine, because once I did my research and found out that it can actually help the autoimmune stuff, like reduce inflammation, that changed my mind frame completely, I was ready to do it.
Now, I wasn't sure about how I was going to do it. I talked to my doctor and I attempted to see if my insurance would cover, he actually prescribed me zeppbound, that was denied and then he prescribed me WeGovy, that was also denied by my current insurance. If I was a diabetic, they would cover it i was told, so that led me back to the website to research companies offering Tirzepatide without a prescription. I ended up choosing Mochi Health, due to the cost; $199 Monthly for Tirzepatide Compounded or $99 for Semiglutide Compunded, there was also a membership fee of $79 monthly which gives you Virtual Doctor and Nutritionist visits. Its the same company the person i watch on YouTube uses so I was able to use her coupon code to get $40 off my membership fee which made it just $39. Once I completed the Mochi Health Online survey and paid the Membership fee (with my HSA card), I was assigned a Doctor and scheduled an online consultation for the very next day. 
The visit went really well, I was able to ask as many questions as I needed and once the doctor understood my health and needs she also decided that Tirzepatide with B12 was the best fit for me. Once the visit was completed I received notice on the Mochi Health app that a prescription for me was sent to the pharmacy (Casa) very quickly (about an hour).
All that was left for me was to pay that first prescription fee, which I did, $199 paid with my HSA card, which I was happy about. 
This all happened on a Friday, November 7th, so my prescription sat with Casa pharmacy for the whole weekend and on Monday, it said that it was shipped, and sure enough I received the medicine that Wednesday the 12th. 
My medicine came from Casa pharmacy, it came in a nice blue Mochi health box and had the blue thermos to keep stuff cold with the three ice packs.Inside and I received probably seven syringes and about ten alcohol pads, it was a very nice presentation.
I decided to take my first shot on November 14th, which is a Friday because, i was thinking that if there are any side effects to this, I'll have the whole weekend to get over them before I go back to work that Monday.
The first shot i took before bed (I figured this would be the best time, so i could sleep off any side effects lol), in my left arm, which was completely painless, i almost wondered if I injected a placebo, because it was just too easy lol, no lingering pain, I didn't feel like the medicine was too cold going in my arm and I took it right out of the refrigerator prior.
I seemed normal the next day or two, Id say on about day 3, the hunger suppression kicked in, and I didn't even realize it was happening. I didn't crave anything, I got full off of liquids, I basically had to force myself to eat, and I would eat a few bites of something, or a few bites of a couple things, and I'd be stuffed. 
So because I was watching this Youtuber for so many months, I was already prepared for this, I purchased electrolytes, I purchased protein drinks, I purchase fiber and collagen supplements. And so I started this routine every morning, where I would make my electrolyte drink, my Protein shake/Coffee mix and random protein rich snacks for the workday, and I made it a point to drink, so much water a day also. They only exercise ive been doing is 30 minutes each night on my eliptical machine at a walking pace.
I have been consistent with this routine daily since day 1.
Fast forward to today, i took shot number 4 last night and weighed myself this morning and I am now 238! So this is really working!
I still have full food noise suppression, and i'm at the 2.5 dose, my next prescription billing is tomorrow, so i'm going to keep it at 2.5 since it's working. Also, I'm loving the B12 compound, I definitely have received an energy boost from this and I used to take a B12 supplement prior to this, and it did not give me the same kind of boost.
If you're on the fence about Mochi health, I think they had some issues, previously when the shortage and all that stuff was happening, but I'd say so far, so good right now.

Soooo yeah, uh… I made a whole song a year ago because apparently my brain thought it was a poet during exam season.
I’m still a total newbie at songwriting and poerty too, barely get time to cook up lyrics between school, stress, and pretending to be productive.

But I really want to know what people think. Like… does it sound deep? cringe? existential?
Be honest — I swear I won’t cry.  (maybe thoda sa).

So yeah, it’s basically “life"", you Maybe I knew about life is?
Lyrics(it may mess up together):
Listen!!! 

You born, you die🎵

You born, you cry,
You slay like a spy.
You roll and crawl,
Then you go outside, embrace your pride.
Like a charm you baby, you gotta right,
You walk like a scarecrow,
You talk with no-flow,
When you cry, it sounds like a crow-crow-crow.
(Oh ho ohh ho)

You amaze,
Make a blissed phase,
Then you grow high with high shy —
Shy to cry.

You blink and you run,
Then school ain’t so fun.
You scribble your name,
Try fortune and fame.

Teenage kicks in, with pimples and pride,
You laugh in your lows, then secretly hide.
Your dreams shout loud, but your voice is shy,
You say you're okay, but don’t know why.

You dress like a rebel, fail a few tries,
Fall in fake love, then break with cries.
You dance through nights, with hopes so sly,
You fall, you fly, you ask the 

Then jobs knock doors, but none stay long,
You wear a tie, but don’t feel strong.
Coffee and clocks, rent on your mind,
Success feels close, but hard to find.

You marry with cake, and shaky knees,
Make silly vows, like “love and peace.”
You smile in frames, forget to feel,
Some days are fake, some strangely real.

You age like a meme, your hair says “bye,”
But still chase goals you don’t know why.
You shout at bills, and sigh at news,
You miss old songs, worn-out shoes.

At forty-nine, you're tired, but bold,
Your laughter lines are stories told.
Then one dull day, on a rainy drive,
A twist of fate — you don’t survive.

Your phone still buzzes, the world walks by,
But you’re the pause beneath the sky.

You born, you cry,
You laugh, you lie,
You love, you try,
You born, you die.

1pf0t2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1pf0t2t/3040_hallucinations/,[3040] Hallucinations,"(this is the first chapter of my dream novel, please review it)

People say positivity is a key to a healthy life, well, it is hard to be positive, I mean, nothing is only awesome, everything has a price, do I make sense till now, nope. Truth is, I don’t know what to write, because when you witness a mass level massacre, stupid mythical creatures frolicking around in sky, sun casually exploding every morning in a matter of microsecond, it is hard to exactly describe that, people behaving that this stuff is normal is not exactly helping my mental health, watching a snake with a baby face is certainly not helping, and please correct me, but last time I checked, a horse with  face of a dragon was not the medium of air transportation, maybe I am dreaming and hallucinating again, maybe not. Well my family certainly thinks so, it is kind of hard to argue on that topic, when they cannot see any of that stupidity.

Best logic, I have gone nuts, I mean, how is it possible that at one instant I am in the real world, goofing around, at other instant, I am being chased by women engulfed in white fire, who desires to invite me to her house so that she can melt my skin to make her tea. It certainly was tempting but firstly, I am not a fan of melting my skin, kind of hard to explain in the school, secondly, while it is beyond me how psychotic you can be that you desire human skin in a tea (I mean if you need my skin’s fat to make your tea consumable, that ought to be a shame on your cooking skills, and that tea wont exactly be hygienic), at least she could have been subtle.

Due to my legendary lifestyle, my social life is good, dogs hate me, cats decide to do cat antics , and   interacting with human beings have certainly led to some interesting results, my class teacher used to send me to school therapist every Monday morning, I also used to send my school therapist to another therapist every Monday afternoon after a 3 hour session which somehow made her question her life choices, finally school ran out of therapists, and I am advised to spend time with my friends, which is great but you see, I am fresh out of friends, I guess that screaming out loud and laughing like a maniac in the cinema hall during a very emotional scene did not do me any favours, don’t ask me what was the scene (I was kind of busy trying to run away from a psychotic telephone tower, that assured me that it will rip me apart rib by rib), which resulted into me and my friends being kicked out of the theatre. I spent the rest of the day trying to cheer them up, needless to say they were not amused, me mimicking a donkeys sound in a middle of a bus certainly did not help, they still are good friends though, for starters, they pretend that I don’t exist, and cannot hear me speaking, and for some reason they removed me from their friends group.

 

Well, now my situation has become a little bit concerning, considering that I almost got murdered 2 times in last 12 hours, third if you count solving differentiation questions for 2 hours, first instance was almost straight from comics, I was back in the freak world again, I was roaming around watching the sun explode, against a  purple sky(yeah, that certainly makes sense) with brown clouds(don’t ask me why), when a boy approached me, he had a goofy smile, small eyes, handsome face, slim hands with branded blazer(I guess second hand) and a laptop bag, he just for some reason said in a heavy English accent

“Mam can I click your photo”

“That is weird” I retorted,

He then started making baby seal eyes “Mam, please, just one photo, I desire to capture a glimpse of traditional India, you are an gorgeous culmination of this culture, please humour me”

 Well, I was flattered, call me an idiot but I love attention

”a photo wouldn’t hurt I guess” I said to myself and then told him to do it fast.

I stood behind a garbage dump and gave my goofiest smile and the most ridiculous pose , he told me to say cheese, and then proceeded to pull a ak-47 from his laptop bag, and aimed it at me, my dumbass brain was a little too slow,

“Hey, that camera is so cool, looks like a AK-47”I remarked,

His smirk disappeared, I felt guilty because he looked genuinely hurt by my comment.

” It is not an AK-47, it is an AK-56” and then shot me in the face.

 I jumped sideways and bullet just passed through the side of my ear, opening a wound, I ran for my life, while the boy, it seemed was kind of trigger happy, cause he was running towards me, shooting bullets everywhere, civilians just looked at us and sighed, some dude riding a snake was pissed off at me and screaming at me for ignoring blue light and crossing the road (sure, ignore a girl getting shot by a psychotic teenager with a AK 56). While I was running for my life, the pyscho boy was singing a crude song, talking about (please imagine a dramatic sigh) guns, and gunpowder, and just to be diverse, missiles. Just my awesome luck, I reached towards a dead end, behind me was a cliff, front of me, was prince charming, the royal pyscho stood for a moment, aimed his AK-56, and shot me point blank, bad news- I fell off the cliff, good news, bullet did not hit me, because idiot had spent all his ammunitions while following me.

While falling off from cliff, I should have some noble thoughts, for a sassy or thought provoking last quote, instead, I was celebrating the fact that there are dumber beings than me (which is saying a lot,)

I saw the water beneath and decided to shut my eyes, with my luck, last thing I would witness, would be a beautiful dolphin, defecating in the water where I am about to die.

Suddenly everything went silent, I started feeling as if I am floating, I hit the ground, first thought, I am dead, so I opened my eyes, and heard a shrill laughter, I was in a large circular room, lights were flickering, and suddenly a voice came, as if the room itself started speaking

“Come weakling, let me kill you fast and painlessly, I feel merciful today”

Suddenly I saw two shadows observing me. To be honest, I was kind of scared, so I spoke what a rational human tends to speak

 “I am bit tired, so could you please be done with theatrics and kill me “I said.

 The shadow jeered at me” Don’t make me change my mind, I can take my time to finish you instead”

Oh, is this the part where you proceed me tell me to donate my soul, or you will take it and torture me, or is it the part where you will tell me your sob story and bore me to oblivion”

“You insufferable irritating idiotic girl, can’t you shut up and enjoy your glorious death”

“Forgive me mademoiselle, I feel honoured, to die in the most clichéd way”

The shadow must have been smarter, because it didn’t reply, instead it started walking towards me, at that moment, I started screaming, the shadow jumped at me and started choking me, it had weird tentacles for hand, I just hoped that those tentacles would not have a good grip, but I was wrong, that grip was strong, I could feel my life ebbing away and Suddenly, I was in the classroom, my face wet, Mr Raja was glaring at me, my bench mate had a annoyed look on her face, her bottle was in her hands, whole class was looking at me, If looks could kill, then I would have dead. There is an old saying called choose your words wisely, I should be the Poster child for people who ignore that saying, because first thing I spoke after this fiasco was

 “Good morning sir”

“Either I skipped some classes, or morning does not include 2 in the afternoon, Swasti do you realize what did you miss today” he spoke in a calm irritated voice.

Suddenly realisation dawned on my face, Raja finally looked relieved, expecting me to apologise for sleeping through the whole school day.

“I missed my breakfast” I sadly muttered with a straight face.

 

That ladies and gentlemen, was the wrong thing to say, for starters, I got 3 sheets of calculus, also a small matter of me running 10 rounds of school ground, and a 30 minute rant from the principal.

Well, if my part time job on hallucinations was not enough I am supposed to do group project, group project is kind of a stretch, considering I am paired with a quiet kid Aman, while grouping me and him, We were given our topics, I am sure that Mrs Smita has a sense of humour, because we are supposed to present a research paper on mentally unstable people, I sat down for research, and I get a list of symptoms these people can show

Odd antics

Hallucinations

Talking to non-existent people

Avoiding socialising

“Oh, our project is going to be so easy “I sang

“Why, this requires intensive work, unless we have a subject to observe “he said

He looked at me for a second, realised whom he was working with, and his expression clearly told me how comfortable he was about my idea.

“Well, I am familiar with the a mentally unstable personality “I sarcastically pointed out

So me met later that day, boy came with his notebook, a pen. Best part was the look on his face

“Chill out, I am not going to eat you”

“I am not scared of you, just had a bad night”

“Let me guess, you had a dream about some psychotic world”

It was a casual throwaway comment,

His face darkened, he suddenly started sweating, looking as if some monster was about to swallow him, finally he nodded

“Yeah, I had, I am having them for years, and I just had an awful dream about a telephone pole promising me to electrocute me alive”

Suddenly realisation dawned on my face, the shock was too much, but somehow I tried to dismiss it as a coincidence.

“Forget it, so should we start working on this project”

“Yeah” he replied

He then opened his notebook, and started with my favourite questions

“Why do you stay alone?”

“Because I don’t want to show more of my personality”

“Do you like being lonely”

“Yes” I lied, but my expression told otherwise, he then rolled his eyes at me.

“Ok fine, I used to hate it, but I have accepted it as my luck”

“Have you tried to socialise”

“Yes, and that worked like a charm”

“Do you take out all your anxiety at animals or physical objects?”

“Nope”

“How do you cope up with loneliness?”

I glared at him

“Got it, sadistic sarcasm, and vindictive humour”

“Is your Ancestor Shakespeare”

“I have no idea that, thou shall wait till I find who Shakespeare is”

“You, sir are an amateur at sarcasm, any time you need a lesson on that, I am available”  
“I am looking forward to that, your highness”

We then proceeded to take sarcastic digs at each other for an hour, finally we arrived at my hallucinations,

“So, do you get to see free virtual reality absurd movies often” he asked politely

“Is sarcasm running thin yet” was my reply

“Okay, do you hallucinate?”

“Yes”

“How often?”

“Too often”

“Okay, when did you have your last hallucination?”

“Yesterday in school”

“You had a freaking 7 hour hallucination, I guess my virtual reality movie jibe was not too far from reality”

“Well, on that I agree, that thing certainly was a movie”

“So, what do you hallucinate about”  
“Is that relevant?”

“It is, using hallucinations, we will pin point your personality, and your hallucinations might explain your behaviour”

At this point, I started laughing like a maniac, till tears came on my face, Aman looked at me with concern, he muttered something about being lucky to witness first case of choking to death by laughing.

“Best of luck, trying to make sense of my hallucinations”I finally managed

 “Okay, tell me about what you usually experience”  
“I always dream about a same thing, I am in a land with weird creatures you might only see in movies, the sky is always purple, I get chased by monsters”  
At this point, his face went pale, he looked as if he had trouble breathing”

“Those monsters are weird, yesterday, one tried to shoot me with a gun “I continued

His face had the expression of a person who was given a death sentence

“I also got chased by a woman engulfed in white fire, who desires to invite me to her house”

“And wants to melt your skin to make coffee “He finished

“No it was tea “I said

We both looked at each other, realising what we had just learnt, Good news, I am not a mentally unstable person, and Bad news was that those were not hallucinations",0,1764954993.0,DestructiveReaders,0,0.33,False

Soooo yeah, uh… I made a whole song a year ago because apparently my brain thought it was a poet during exam season.
I’m still a total newbie at songwriting and poerty too, barely get time to cook up lyrics between school, stress, and pretending to be productive.

But I really want to know what people think. Like… does it sound deep? cringe? existential?
Be honest — I swear I won’t cry.  (maybe thoda sa.

So yeah, it’s basically “life"", you Maybe I knew about life is?
Lyrics:

You born, you die🎵

You born, you cry,
You slay like a spy.
You roll and crawl,
Then you go outside, embrace your pride.
Like a charm you baby, you gotta right,
You walk like a scarecrow,
You talk with no-flow,
When you cry, it sounds like a crow-crow-crow.
(Oh ho ohh ho)

You amaze,
Make a blissed phase,
Then you grow high with high shy —
Shy to cry.

You blink and you run,
Then school ain’t so fun.
You scribble your name,
Try fortune and fame.

Teenage kicks in, with pimples and pride,
You laugh in your lows, then secretly hide.
Your dreams shout loud, but your voice is shy,
You say you're okay, but don’t know why.

You dress like a rebel, fail a few tries,
Fall in fake love, then break with cries.
You dance through nights, with hopes so sly,
You fall, you fly, you ask the 

Then jobs knock doors, but none stay long,
You wear a tie, but don’t feel strong.
Coffee and clocks, rent on your mind,
Success feels close, but hard to find.

You marry with cake, and shaky knees,
Make silly vows, like “love and peace.”
You smile in frames, forget to feel,
Some days are fake, some strangely real.

You age like a meme, your hair says “bye,”
But still chase goals you don’t know why.
You shout at bills, and sigh at news,
You miss old songs, worn-out shoes.

At forty-nine, you're tired, but bold,
Your laughter lines are stories told.
Then one dull day, on a rainy drive,
A twist of fate — you don’t survive.

Your phone still buzzes, the world walks by,
But you’re the pause beneath the sky.

You born, you cry,
You laugh, you lie,
You love, you try,
You born, you die.

Lost direction, confidence, and feel like I’m drifting through life.","I don’t know if this is the right place, but I’ve been carrying this for a long time and just needed to get it out somewhere.

I’m 32 and divorced for about two years.  
The truth is I didn’t even want to get married at that time. My parents kept insisting it was a good match, and I’ve always been someone who says yes just to keep people happy. I never really made decisions for myself.

The marriage fell apart quickly.  
Arguments, counselling, tension every day. At one point during a fight, I was told I wasn’t “man enough” or “good for sex.” I don’t think I’ve fully recovered from how that made me feel. Even now it hits me at random times and hurts more than I admit.

After the divorce, I told myself I’d finally start making my own choices.  
But instead of choosing the right things, I ended up saying no to everything. I don’t trust myself or others easily. I don’t know how to find the middle ground between being influenced by everyone and shutting down completely.

The last 2–3 years I’ve been drifting.  
I tried learning different fields — SAP , DevOps, Data, Testing — but I always stop after a few days. I want to restart my life, but something blocks me every time.

My days look the same: wake up, coffee, laptop, random YouTube videos, Insta, long nap, aimless evenings. I used to play badminton every day for months but even that stopped. I’ve lost consistency in everything.

I even had a job offer two years ago and didn’t take it because I kept hoping for something more “interesting.” Looking back, I regret it because I’m still in the same exact place.

My parents want me to settle down again because of my age. They mean well, but that pressure brings back memories I don’t want to revisit, and it creates more stress at home.

Right now I just feel stuck between who I used to be and who I want to become.  
I don’t know how to get direction or confidence back.  
I’m scared that if I keep going like this, another year will pass and nothing will change.

I’m not looking for pity. I just needed to let this out somewhere. And if anyone has been through something similar — divorce, losing confidence, drifting for years — I’d like to know how you found your way back.

The story begins with a shocking phone call that disrupts the protagonist’s life: her younger brother, Evan, has been in a car accident and claims to have traveled through time. This unexpected revelation throws her into turmoil, especially when Evan shows up at her workplace and mistakenly refers to her boss, Lyman Mann, as her husband. The protagonist feels a mix of anxiety and embarrassment as Evan’s chaotic behavior threatens her already precarious job situation, particularly after receiving a stern reprimand from Lyman.

As the protagonist rushes to manage the situation, Evan’s bizarre comments only deepen her confusion. He questions Lyman about his feelings for her, referencing a tattoo, which infuriates Lyman and leaves the protagonist bewildered. Later that evening, she contemplates resigning from her job due to the stress but is interrupted by a series of texts from Lyman that suggest he is trying to understand Evan’s strange claims about the future. This adds another layer of tension to her day, as she grapples with the implications of Evan’s assertions.

The protagonist’s anxiety peaks when she receives a call from her mother confirming that Evan has awakened but is still speaking in riddles about the future. Despite her frustration at the absurdity of Evan’s claims, she cannot shake the worry for her brother’s well-being. The atmosphere at her workplace is tense, and her colleagues express concern for her, further complicating her emotional state. The day becomes a whirlwind of confusion and tension, with the protagonist feeling trapped between her family crisis and her professional life.

As the workday progresses, the mood shifts slightly when Lyman resolves a significant company issue, leading to a rare moment of camaraderie among coworkers. They celebrate the prospect of a paid day off, and Lyman’s demeanor softens, revealing a more human side to his character. However, just as the protagonist begins to feel a sense of relief, she receives another call from her mother informing her that Evan is on his way to pick her up, leaving her anxious about the impending chaos. This unexpected twist adds to the mounting pressure she faces, as she prepares to confront the fallout from her brother’s peculiar behavior.

\*\*Lanterns Along Forest Paths — Miles Harrington\*\*

\*\*Chapter 1\*\*

The day everything shifted began with a call that sent my heart racing. My younger brother, Evan Hogan, had been in a car accident, and when he finally regained consciousness, he was adamant that he had just returned from a journey through time.

Imagine my shock when he barged into my workplace, a place where I had worked diligently to prove myself, and called my notoriously stern boss, Lyman Mann, my husband.

My stomach twisted into knots. The last thing I needed was for Evan to irritate Lyman again, especially after I had just endured a harsh reprimand for a mistake at work. I could feel the weight of my job hanging precariously in the balance.

With urgency, I dashed toward Evan, determined to pull him away from the chaos he was creating. But just as I reached him, he latched onto Lyman’s belt as if it were a lifeline.

“Lyman!” he exclaimed, his voice ringing with an odd mix of excitement and urgency. “You haven’t told Hilda that you love her?! What’s wrong with you?”

My mind reeled. What was he talking about?

“You even tattooed her name on your lower back! What’s stopping you?”

His words were a jumble of confusion, and I stood there, completely baffled. Lyman’s complexion transformed into a deep shade of crimson, his fury palpable.

That evening, feeling defeated and anxious, I found myself sitting at my desk, fingers hovering over the keyboard as I contemplated typing up my resignation. But just as I was about to hit send, I noticed my phone buzzing with a text from Lyman directed at Evan.

“How many kids do we have in the future?”

“Do they look like Hilda or me?”

“Divorcing?!”

“Is there another man? Give me the name of that jerk!”

The words swirled in my mind, leaving me in a state of disbelief.

—

When my mother’s call came through, I had just exited Lyman’s office after receiving another scathing critique.

“Mom, is Evan awake?” I asked, my heart racing with hope.

Evan, my brother, was a senior in high school, and two nights prior, he had left school on his bike only to find himself in a terrible accident. For two agonizing days, he had remained unconscious in the hospital, and the worry had gnawed at me, contributing to the blunder that had resulted in my boss’s wrath.

“Yes! He’s awake!” Mom exclaimed, her voice filled with uncontainable excitement. “The doctor is checking on him now.”

“How is he? His vision and hearing are normal, right? He still recognizes you?” I pressed, my anxiety spiking.

There was a moment of silence on the line, and my heart raced. “Is he blind? Deaf?”

“Neither,” Mom replied, her tone shifting. “But he keeps saying strange things.”

Just then, I could hear the commotion in the background, Evan’s voice bubbling with enthusiasm. “Does this mean I’m the chosen one?

“Mom! Is that Hilda? Give me the phone!”

I was taken aback by the sudden shift in the conversation.

“Hilda! Listen! I’m Evan from the year 2035! You have to listen to me! I swear I’ll make us rich…”

I hung up, my expression a mask of disbelief.

Did that brat really think I had time for this nonsense?

The company’s finances had recently taken a downturn, and Lyman’s mood had plummeted to an all-time low. The atmosphere in the office was thick with tension, and I could feel the weight of it pressing down on me as I returned to my desk.

As I settled back in, my coworkers exchanged sympathetic glances.

One colleague leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. “Hilda, are you okay?”

It took me a moment to process her concern. “I’m fine,” I replied, forcing a smile.

She gave me a thumbs-up, her expression brightening. “You’re so strong. Getting scolded by Mean Lyman doesn’t seem to faze you at all.”

“Mean Lyman,” as they affectionately dubbed him, was a title that had become synonymous with my boss, Lyman Mann.

Her eyes darted to someone behind me, and her conversation abruptly halted.

Lyman had emerged from his office, a towering figure with an imposing presence. His broad shoulders and long legs made him look even more formidable, and even the simplest of suits seemed to radiate sophistication when he wore it.

He stepped into the elevator, phone pressed to his ear, and as soon as the doors slid shut, a collective sigh of relief swept through the office.

“Looks like Mean Lyman has figured out how to resolve the capital chain issue.”

“He works too hard.”

“Right? And he expects us to keep up with him.”

“Hilda, you graduated from the same college, didn’t you? And he’s your senior?”

Suddenly, the focus shifted back to me. I nodded, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks.

“Has Mean Lyman always been like this since college?”

I paused, searching for the right words. “What do you mean?”

My colleague pondered for a moment before saying, “You know, like he’s a robot.”

It was true; Lyman was my senior and had been the chair of the young volunteers association we were part of.

We hardly spoke back then, and I never considered us friends. I always thought it would be rude to comment on his demeanor.

I offered vague responses to satisfy their curiosity and retreated to the break room with my cup of coffee, my mind swirling with thoughts.

As I stood there, lost in contemplation, I couldn’t shake the question that had been posed. Was Lyman really like a robot back in college?

I shook my head, disagreeing with the notion.

Not then…

The break room was small but well-stocked, a small oasis within our modest company.

Once, an intern had fainted from low blood sugar, prompting Lyman to create a dedicated corner for candies and chocolates. There were even emergency tampons in the ladies’ room, a thoughtful touch that spoke volumes about his character.

Lyman typically attended business dinners alone, only bringing a male employee if he needed company.

These were the subtle details that often went unnoticed, but they revealed a man who was shouldering the weight of the company with quiet determination.

He returned just before the clock signaled the end of the workday, a rare smile gracing his features.

Someone whispered, “Problem solved. No overtime tonight.”

Yes, things had taken a turn for the better. We were informed that we could take a paid day off tomorrow, and the office erupted into cheers.

“I love you, boss!”

“I love our company!”

“I love Mean Lyman!”

At that moment, Lyman stepped out of his office, and the person who had exclaimed “Mean Lyman” quickly clamped their mouth shut, embarrassment flooding their face.

Lyman, however, didn’t seem offended. He scanned the room with an air of indifference.

“Go home early today,” he instructed, his gaze landing on me.

I nodded vigorously, my heart racing. “Yes, boss.”

As I stood behind Lyman, waiting for the elevator, my phone buzzed again. It was another call from my mom.

“Evan is being discharged. He said he’s coming to pick you up. I…”

“Pick me up?” I frowned, concern flooding my thoughts. “Where is he now?”

“I think he’s on his way to your office.”

Mom explained that Evan had snuck out with just a note while she was occupied with paperwork. I could already feel a headache brewing.

“Okay, I understand. I’ll bring him home,” I replied, hanging up just as the elevator doors opened. Lyman and I stepped inside, my mind racing with the unexpected turn of events.

# Conclusion

As the day drew to a close, the whirlwind of emotions that had engulfed me began to settle into a fragile calm. Evan’s unexpected return from the brink of disaster had shaken the very foundation of my world, forcing me to confront not only my brother’s precarious state but also the complexities of my own life. The chaos he had unleashed in the office had inadvertently revealed cracks in my carefully constructed facade, illuminating the hidden depths of my relationship with Lyman. His stern exterior, once intimidating, now seemed to harbor a warmth I had overlooked, a flicker of humanity that resonated with my own struggles. In those moments, I realized that perhaps I was not as alone in my burdens as I had believed. The prospect of tomorrow loomed ahead, filled with uncertainty but also the potential for connection, both with my brother and with Lyman.

The unexpected turn of events had ignited a spark within me, urging me to reconsider my own choices and the paths I had been too afraid to explore. Evan’s insistence that he had glimpsed a future where love and happiness intertwined with our day-to-day struggles had forced me to question my own priorities. As I stood beside Lyman in the elevator, the weight of the day’s revelations hung in the air, a promise of change that I could no longer ignore. I felt a stirring of hope, a desire to embrace the unknown and the possibility of forging deeper connections with those around me. With Evan’s recovery as a catalyst, I was ready to step into the light of new beginnings, lanterns guiding my way along the forest paths of life, illuminating the way forward with love, understanding, and the courage to face whatever lay ahead.

Some women have even said that they dont want to be bothered. The issue with this logic is that you will miss every shot you dont take and rejection is part of the game. 

But to back up, we have to define what creepy is actually. Alot of what women think is creepy is when a man doesnt take no for an answer or is a bad at reading social cues aka social awkwardness. Really, you just have to be social calibrated to read vibes of when to engage and when to let it go. 

For example, if I go up to a woman, I would never say I thought she was pretty. Instead, I would compliment her outfit then read the vibes. If she doesnt engage, its just a compliment. If she ask me a question, we are in. I may throw a neutral statement like oh wow this coffee shop is huge, what do you think about it? Then she engages or she doesnt. No harm, no foul. 

I personally have done a few cold approaches at coffee shops and I was surprised that the women wanted to continue the convo. In fact, they started to ask me personally questions and I was taken aback. I asked women on the street for the time, gave a compliment, and even asked what is your opinion of me walking up to you. Alot of them, gave neutral to positive responses. I never got negative responses. 

So its all about how you come and how you leave. The aim isnt for a date, its to connect. If it isnt there, I move on. If it is, then I transition into saying I found her attractive and love to do an activity based on our convo. Then go for the number. Thats not creepy. 

But I would love to hear from other guys because I feel like alot of people misinterpret what a good cold approach looks like versus creepy behavior. ",1,1764954579.0,AskMenAdvice,269,0.5,False

So this happened two months ago, and I’m still sick thinking about it. My friend and I planned a small road trip, nothing dramatic, just a weekend drive to clear our heads. 

On the first day she realized she “forgot her wallet” (huge red flag I stupidly ignored), so when we stopped for gas she asked if she could just use my card and Venmo me later. Fine, whatever, I didn’t want the trip to start awkward.  Except gas was only the beginning.

Every stop after that somehow ended with her using my card again. Coffee? “I’ll pay you later.” Snacks? “Can you just put it on your card, it’s easier?” We grabbed dinner and I went to the bathroom, came back and she’d handed my card to the waiter. I should’ve said something right there, but confrontation is my kryptonite and I didn’t want to be “that person” on a trip.

We got back home and I checked my balance… and my heart literally dropped.  
She hadn’t charged me just gas. She’d used it for lunch, dinner, Starbucks, random little shops, a souvenir stand, and god knows what else. It was basically a shopping spree funded by my stupidity. My credit utilization jumped to almost 80% overnight. I didn’t even know she spent that much.

I confronted her and she had the audacity to say, “It’s not that serious, you make more money than me.” I swear I almost ascended.

I’ve been working all year to fix my credit, tracking everything, budgeting tightly. And now one dumb weekend undid months of progress.

I paid the card down, but the score drop already happened.

So yeah TIFU by trying to be a nice friend and instead sponsoring someone else’s vacation.  
Never again.

TL;DR: I let my friend use my card on a road trip for “just gas,” she ended up charging basically the entire trip on it, maxed my utilization to 80%, tanked my credit, and then acted like I was overreacting. Never letting anyone touch my card again.",5,1764954527.0,tifu,44,0.54,False

Dear Agent,

Professor Mariell Keyes has lost her mother to cancer, her job to scandal, and her patience for self-pity. So, when a shadowy branch of the military offers her a ticket out of Boston to study human tribes in a distant galaxy, she says yes.

At Base O.N.E., she realizes her new colleagues are hiding more than just bad coffee. The galaxy is haunted by Mane, a humanoid, vampiric species treating entire worlds like livestock, making Mariell question the point of her research. Assigned to care for a Mane specimen the base jokingly calls Greg, she questions the ethics of her work and pushes to join an off-world team.

Her persistence lands her on a rescue mission gone wrong, leaving her stranded on a Mane ship and forced to team up with Ako, a Mane outcast and reluctant ally. They escape to a planet erased from the star charts, where Ako is worshipped as a god, and the locals believe Mariell is the answer to a prophecy. She’s not convinced, but one thing the prophecy got right is the impossible pull between Mariell and Ako.

As Mariell uncovers the truth about her own abilities and the planet’s history, she must decide what she’s willing to risk for a shot at a new life—and whether she can trust Ako, whose healing touch makes her younger, but comes with a price neither of them fully understands.

Meanwhile, Greg has escaped and is leading a bloody revolution. To save her new home and everyone she’s come to care about, Mariell must infiltrate Greg’s stronghold and face the consequences of every choice she’s made.

MANE is a 117,000-word science fiction novel with romantic elements, combining the found family and politics of Annalee Newitz’s *The Terraformers* with the angsty transformation from grief to love in Thalia Hibbert’s *The Roommate Risk*.

Pumunta ako dun sa part ng airport kung saan may sasaksakan. May maraming nationalities din andun. Sobrang saya ko kasi pwedeng umupo gamitin ang laptop for free at no need mag lounge or coffee shop.

Sa totoo lang, nakita ko yung puting babae sa kabilang table na iniwan niya phone nya nakasaksak. So syempre hindi ako umimik at tinaas ko mga balikat ko para iinsinuate na hindi ko alam. Ayoko madamay sa katangahan niya. Lol Narealize niya kalaunan na wala siyang makukuhang anything sa akin kaya lumipat siya ng table at dun niya nakita ang iniwan nyang nakasaksak na cellphone. Hindi man lang siya nag sorry sa akin. Di naman ako mayaman pero pwede kong ihampas ang macbook sa pagmumukha niya at ipakain ang iphone ko. Masyadong hambog at ako pa ang napag tripan.

The second night was worse.

James had lashed the tiller and let the yacht drift, unwilling to leave the cockpit despite the icy wind that cut through his jacket. Sleep was impossible. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw that pale head rising from the waves, the grin carved too wide, too eager.

The fog had not lifted. It hugged the *Seabird* like a cocoon, erasing distance, smothering light. Beyond the glow of the navigation lamps, there was nothing, only gray thickness, swallowing sound and shape.

And inside that blankness, the voices prowled.

Sometimes they sang; other times they whispered. He caught fragments: “…come play…,” “…don’t hide…,” “…we see you…” They never came from the same place twice. One moment they seemed beneath the deck, the next they floated above the mast, the next they giggled from directly behind his ear.

James spun, flashlight stabbing the fog. Always empty. Always nothing.

By midnight, his nerves frayed like worn rope. He was shaking, not just from cold but from the constant anticipation, the waiting for something he could neither see nor fight. The sea, once a place of calm rhythm, had become a stage for phantoms.

At some unknown hour, time dissolved in fog, he heard a new sound.

A splash. Then another. Then the rapid *slap* of water against the hull, as though many hands were striking it in unison. James’s heart lurched. He leaned over the side, flashlight beam skittering across the black surface.

Shapes moved in the water. Small, pale, darting just beneath the surface. He caught glimpses: a tiny hand breaking the waves, a head turning toward him with eyes open and shining unnaturally white.

“God…” James staggered back, gripping the mast to steady himself.

The shapes circled the yacht. Laughter bubbled up from the water, impossible, muffled and yet clear. High-pitched giggles, as if dozens of children were treading water around the *Seabird*, delighting in his terror.

Then came the *thud*. Something heavy struck the hull from below, jolting the boat. James stumbled and fell to his knees. Another thud, this one on the starboard side. Then again on port. The yacht rocked violently, as though battered by submerged bodies.

“No!” His scream cracked across the night. “Leave me alone!”

For a heartbeat, silence. Then, from all around, in perfect unison:

*“We all fall down.”*

The chant swelled, overlapping, louder and louder, until James clapped his hands to his ears and curled into himself, teeth bared in a grimace. The sound wasn’t only in the air, it vibrated through the hull, through the mast, through his own bones. The *Seabird* seemed to shiver with it.

He didn’t remember passing out.

When James opened his eyes, weak daylight seeped through thinning fog. His body ached from the hard deck, his throat raw from shouting. The boat was steady. The sea calm.

Had it happened? Or had he finally broken under the weight of exhaustion?

He forced himself below deck, brewing instant coffee with shaking hands. The bitter taste was grounding, though not comforting. He stared at the compass, needle steady, pointing east toward Norway. Land was still two days away. Two days of this.

His radio sat on the cabin shelf. He stared at it, torn. He could call for help, but what would he say? That he was being haunted by drowned children? That the sea was singing nursery rhymes? They’d think he’d gone mad.

But wasn’t that what was happening?

He gripped the radio mic, thumb hovering over the button. Static hissed softly. He imagined a voice answering, human and steady, dragging him back into the sane world. The thought was almost painful.

He pressed the button. “This is the *Seabird*. Anyone copy? Over.”

Static.

“Seabird to any vessel, I need assistance. Over.”

The static crackled louder, then softened. And then, laughter.

James dropped the mic as though it burned. High-pitched giggling spilled from the speaker, distant but unmistakable.

“No… no, no, no.” He slammed the radio off, heart pounding. He was cut off, the voices tainting even the lifeline meant to connect him to the world.

He was theirs.

That afternoon, the fog finally broke. The sea spread wide again, stretching into a clear horizon. James should have felt relief, but instead dread rooted deeper. The fog had hidden them. Now the children, whatever they were, had nowhere to hide.

He scanned the water constantly, eyes gritty, head pounding. Every whitecap, every swell looked like a pale face. He began muttering under his breath, nonsense phrases, anything to fill the silence.

The singing didn’t return until dusk.

It started soft, a single voice, no more than a hum. It drifted on the wind, fragile but insistent. James froze, one hand on the tiller. He knew ignoring it was useless, but acknowledging it felt like surrender.

The hum turned into song, the words clear now:

*“Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream…”*

The irony made bile rise in his throat. He spun in place, scanning the horizon. Nothing. Just sea and fading sky.

*“…merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily…”*

The voice multiplied. Two children. Four. Six. A choir building, surrounding him.

*“…life is but a dream.”*

The last note stretched impossibly long, the pitch warping into something inhuman, vibrating through the rigging. James clapped his hands over his ears, but the sound drilled deeper, inside his skull. He dropped to his knees, teeth rattling, vision swimming.

Then silence.

James gasped, chest heaving. His ears rang. The boat rocked gently, as though nothing had happened.

But the dread didn’t fade.

He knew they were closer now.

That night brought the worst yet.

James had retreated below deck, lantern burning, knife clutched in one trembling hand. He sat hunched on the berth, back to the wall, listening. Every creak of the hull, every sigh of the sea was an omen.

Hours dragged. His eyelids grew heavy. He dozed.

And then the cabin door rattled.

His eyes flew open. The knife slipped in his sweaty grip. The latch jiggled, again and again, as though someone small was tugging on it, testing it.

James held his breath, muscles taut, eyes locked on the thin wood.

The jiggling stopped. Silence.

Then, tap. Tap. Tap. Right above his head. Footsteps. Small, light, scampering across the deck.

His pulse roared in his ears. He forced himself to stand, every nerve screaming. He reached for the lantern and crept to the companionway.

He pushed the door open.

The deck was empty.

But wet footprints trailed across the wood. Tiny. Bare. Leading from bow to stern.

James stumbled backward, bile rising. He swung the lantern wildly, light spilling across the boat. Nothing. The prints glistened, then began to fade as though licked away by the air.

And then he heard it.

A child’s voice. Right behind him.

“Found you.”

James spun, knife raised. The lantern swung with him, its flame flaring. The cabin entrance yawned dark. Empty.

His breathing came ragged. He felt eyes on him, dozens of them, just beyond the edge of the lantern’s glow. Watching. Waiting.

The boat shifted suddenly, a violent lurch. James slammed against the rail, knife clattering to the deck. The *Seabird* tilted as if something massive had shoved it from below. Wood groaned, water sprayed. He grabbed the rail, knuckles white.

Another impact, harder. The mast shuddered, sails snapping. The yacht rocked dangerously, one side dipping toward the sea.

And then hands. Pale, wrinkled, too small. Dozens of them gripping the edge of the boat, fingers curling over the rail, pulling. James screamed, yanking at the lantern to see.

The flame flickered across faces rising from the water. Children’s faces. Bloated, pale, eyes wide and gleaming like glass marbles. Their mouths stretched in joyous grins, water pouring from their lips. They giggled as they climbed, dozens of them, their voices overlapping in a chorus of play.

“Come play, James.”  
“Stay with us.”  
“Don’t leave.”

Their nails scraped wood as they pulled higher, their bodies slick and dripping.

James stumbled back, heart hammering so hard it hurt. He snatched the lantern and hurled it.

Flame exploded across the rail, oil splashing onto the nearest figures. For a moment, firelight blinded him, then the children shrieked, a sound that pierced like knives. They dropped back into the sea, hissing, giggles dissolving into shrill wails.

James collapsed to his knees, sobbing, ears ringing from their cries. The boat rocked, then steadied. Silence returned.

The rail was charred. The sea, once again, empty.

But James knew this wasn’t victory. It was only a reprieve.

It is the 4th time since I started working full time (6 years ago) that I have to take a sick leave because of my neurodivergence.

I’m more than able to take on any task the jobs I’ve been requiring (including managing complex projects and being head of department) and the job part is actually the fun and relaxing part of my day. But everything around it becomes impossible to sustain once I’m working full time : commuting on transports full of people, eating lunch and having coffee breaks with coworkers drain me from all the energy I have, friendships feel like something I need to cut off because I have no energy left. In the evening I’m not even able to prep meals because I have really no energy left or mental space left at all.

I feel like a failure. I’ll turn 37 next week and I feel hopeless. How do people ever manage to have a normal life? My psychologist and psychiatrist both said I have to find way to make my everyday life easier but I’m stuck.

Good morning Enthusiasts!  
I'm here to learn about pre-roasted coffee brands that I can get in the U.S.  
I've been in the coffee game a while and traditionally like a medium roast in a French press I can chew on to start my day or a Robusta in a phin dripper in some form of a coconut water americano (had one in Thailand and fell in love). I have been roasting my own beans for a while from Burman Coffee and a few smaller places, but I'm ready to venture out...

My FAVORITE so far has been 2 separate Ugandan beans that I roasted in the past, one was sort of fruity, while the other was almost nutty and funky. Ugandan beans just seem near impossible to find for some reason unless I'm just searching to wrong places. I also have loved some Ethiopian light roasts, but they are just the devil to hone in when roasting yourself. 

I just started making ""soup"" as a way to maximize extraction while kicking the can down the road of buying a pricey espresso machine, and I was SHOCKED by the results and flavors it resulted in.

Now I want to start buying pre roasted beans to really explore the world of coffee through the expert roasters out there that really hone in on their flavors. I have seen some micro roasters like showbox & aviary thrown around but they are always sold out.  
I also found minmax which seems pretty incredible.   
I know everyone has wildly different tastes in coffee, I'm willing to try them all ultralights, fermented, you name it.  
Are there like 5 or so brands that are the ""Go-To"" brands for a lot of coffee lovers? Something that has a little something for everyone. What's like the ""Folgers"" of specialty coffee companies? Obviously with the thousands of places out there this may be hard, but there's gotta be some larger known places i can dip my toes in and try? And bonus points if they have Ugandan beans ;-)",3,1764953969.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Now, if I Google this question, the general answer seems to be “No, coffee extract in a bath wouldn’t do this.” But I’m also more sensitive to ingredients in things than many people; ex.

We love the idea of building a creative hub outside the city, somewhere with community energy and room to grow. Owen Sound has been on our radar because of the arts scene, affordability, college crowds, tourism, and slower pace compared to Toronto.

Before we make the move, I wanted to ask the community:

1. How supportive is Owen Sound for creative businesses?

Are there already strong arts communities, local creators, or small business networks we should connect with?

2. Would a workspace + photography studio café be useful here?

Do locals or visitors tend to look for coworking spaces? Is there demand for photo studios, content creation spaces, or creative workshops?

3. What challenges should we expect starting a business here?

Permits, zoning, seasonality, tourism patterns, foot traffic, local expectations — anything we should know ahead of time?

4. Any neighbourhoods or streets that are ideal for a café or studio?

We’re looking for an area with decent foot traffic, parking, and a welcoming vibe for creatives.

5. Are there grants or economic development programs we should look into?

We’ve seen mentions of rural/small-town funding but would love to hear from people with actual experience.

⸻

We’re excited about the idea of bringing something new to the community and contributing to the creative scene — but we also want to do it right and understand the landscape first.

Any advice, suggestions, warnings, or local insights would mean a lot.
Thanks!

I got home after 2am and it's 3:40 now. My wife left my Facebook open (I don't really use it and don't have anything to hide anyway) I saw my old best friends name pop up on contacts. 

TW: suicide, depression. (Mentioned once).



I nearly messaged my high school best friend on Facebook. We haven't spoken for nearly 10 years. I get chatty when I'm drunk, and I don't really like being drunk because of it. I don't have a social life. I don't see people outside my household or my workplace. I don't go places socially. I just kind of trudge through life day after day. Surviving well. I'm happy, don't get me wrong. But I don't have any social outlet. And it's effecting me.

I miss the friendship we had. I miss all that. What stopped it was my severe depression. I was suicidal and was having a hard time. The last time I saw him he said ""my girlfriend has it worse"". It invalidated my whole being at the time. I didn't want to know him then. 
Now I know what he meant...then at the time, I didn't. I was sad. I didn't need that kind of context. I needed a friend. It was the last time I saw him.....

I miss the friends I used to have.

I’m a small business owner who recently opened my cafe and am considering applying to be a drink vendor for Kilby 2026. I’ve never been to Kilby before so I’m not sure what kind of drink vendors they’ve had in the past, and am wondering — if you saw a coffee/matcha vendor, would you buy a drink? 

I am aware it’s a festival and alcoholic drinks are probably going to be more popular so that’s why I’m wondering what the overall consensus is for attendees. Is it worth going in as a drink vendor when other food vendors will probably offer their own beverages, too? I assume it’d be easier to just get food and drink at one stall rather than stall hop. 

We sell more than just coffee/matcha, too. We offer refreshing beverages that are non-caffeinated, and more. 

I looked into the vendor application for 2025, but haven’t seen a lot of information about it for next year. I’d really love to put my business out there and bring it to Kilby, but I’m wondering if our stall would even attract customers when there’s so many other established beverage vendors and alcohol available. 

Would you, as a festival-goer, make time out of your day to buy a coffee or matcha?

Wrapping up today’s cupping session — and as you can see in the photo, the cup on the left is almost at the bottom, which basically says how much I liked it compared to the one on the right. Honestly, I could already tell the difference between them even before starting, but cupping always gives that extra clarity since you can compare them side-by-side.

Both cups are from the same coffee, and I already know how they taste when brewed with different grind sizes. But during cupping, the contrast became even more obvious. Aroma-wise, they were nearly identical — I couldn’t pick out any difference at all. Flavor, though, was a different story, especially the aftertaste.

The K7 cup had a lingering aftertaste that wasn’t pleasant, while the Sculptor cup was cleaner, sweeter, and more defined. Its acidity was brighter and tastier, whereas the K7’s acidity felt muted — which makes sense, since the Sculptor usually produces juicier and more expressive cups. The K7 still tasted nice, but with noticeably less clarity.

The conclusion was pretty clear: I didn’t even need the comparison, but I wanted to double-check my assumptions. Now I have a much better idea of the K7’s character — which lines up with what I expected, especially considering how it behaves with espresso and how it can choke machines. So for me, it’s a grinder I’ll use for certain coffees; not every roast benefits from extremely high clarity, especially heavier processed beans.

Overall, it was a fun and useful session. It confirmed some suspicions and gave me more confidence in what I already thought. That’s my takeaway from today’s cupping.",13,1764953450.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

Couple days ago my older sister and my mother frequently come into my room to just tidy it and sometimes place new furniture there. Mind you I have told them and complained to them several times as a muslim man in my early 20s that share a room with my little brother not to touch my stuff. I don’t mind them cleaning it, but to come home from work having a shelf I’ve never seen be in my room half my stuff on the desk and small bed is just irritating. I have told my mother millions of times not to just go in to my room like that but to at least have the decency to ask. Mind you we live in a flat with my sister having her own room, but if I was to ever step foot she would confront me as well as my mum telling me off for going to her room. But with my room they come in and out as they please. I’m also a light sleeper, meaning that any little sounds would actually wake me up easily. 

Now I’m going to be fair on my mother as she now tries to be as quiet as possible when she wakes my little brother up but that’s from all the complaining that I’ve done before to get to that point. 

Sharing a room is just a nightmare. I have no privacy at all. It’s like I’m in a coffee shop. My brother goes in and out whenever he wants, my mother and my sister. Even my dad sometimes when he comes back from abroad just casually just opens the door to look for something in my room without saying anything. I hate every second of it. 

For 5 years I’ve been living like this. There’s been nights sometimes where I’ve genuinely cried my eyes out for not having a room like my friends do, as I see them having huge beds with their own TV and here I am having to complain to my parents just for some decency to at least knock on the door before they storm in or AT LEAST shut the door on their way out. 

On the weekend I lost it. I come home and half my papers, important documents are gone and relocated to another space under my bed, with some of the papers completely missing. I try to ask my mother what she did and she casually just brushes it off and says it’s not a big deal and they just rearranged some stuff. Very clearly she could tell I was irritated so I say nothing and just go back into my room. She comes in 1 hour later and asks what days I’m off work. This is the part where I completely ignore her and don’t say a single thing. Then she shouts at me and curses at me and storms out my room. 

Ever since then she hasn’t talked to me, neither have I. And I genuinely have no patience anymore and I refuse to apologise. I’m an adult, I need my space sometimes and I don’t have it. They don’t even respect me or my boundaries but when it comes to my sister and little brother it’s very different. They get the best treatment but not me. I’m sorry if this was too long. I sometimes cry when I think about myself. I genuinely feel like I don’t have anyone, even my own mother I don’t feel like she has my back. If anyone experienced something similar to me in terms of not speaking to parents, how did you cope? 

For the brothers and sisters telling me to apologise, jazakallah khair for the advice genuinely, but I’ve reached a point of carelessness where I just can’t bring myself to go back and talk to them. They are stubborn but when it comes to my respect I also demand it and am stubborn.

1pf00wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1pf00wp/handler_aggression_and_dog_reactivity_can_it_get/,"Handler aggression and dog reactivity, can it get better?","I’m sorry if this is a bit rambling — I’m really upset and trying to think clearly.

My dog is an Irish Terrier, 1 year and 9 months old. I got her from a reputable breeder who offers a return-for-any-reason policy. I’ve had her since she was about 8–9 weeks. As a puppy she seemed fairly typical: she learned bite inhibition, was friendly with dogs and people, but she was definitely rude with other dogs and didn’t take corrections well. She did group puppy classes and was socialized, though probably not as thoroughly as she could have been.

I’m now trying to decide if I should return her. She’s dog-reactive and will attempt to attack other dogs — not just barking or lunging, but actively trying to get to them. We’re working with a trainer and she’s on Reconcile, and her dog reactivity *has* been improving.

My bigger concern is her handler aggression. She has multiple bite incidents involving me, my partner, and her dog walker. Our vet believes these bites are frustration-based. They often happen right after returning from a walk or at bedtime, but sometimes there seems to be no trigger at all — like she’ll run into the kitchen and bite me while I’m making coffee. She also sometimes bites when I’m closing her crate, despite being conditioned to the crate since she came home.

I feel like we aren’t able to give her the best outlets to just *be a dog* because she’s so reactive. We can’t safely do off-leash walks, swimming, or anything that involves other dogs. We do scent work and puzzles at home, and she loves learning tricks, obedience, and things like cavaletti. I’ve taken her to barn hunt a couple times — maybe we need more structured activities like that?

On the bite scale, her bites are around a 2–3. She’s never punctured with her canines, but she has left cuts with her back teeth. Our vet suggested keeping her muzzled more often. I just ordered a custom muzzle so she can comfortably wear it for longer periods; right now she only has a Baskerville for vet visits.

I guess my real question is: **Is it realistic to hope that things will improve enough for us to have a normal, enjoyable life together? Or am I signing up for a lifetime of constant management and vigilance if I keep her?**",2,1764953223.0,reactivedogs,5,1.0,False

On paper, it doesn’t sound like that strong of a relationship but I swear, brothers, I was convinced this was the woman I was going to marry. I felt it. 

We met back in March, on Tinder, and we got to talking. It felt like fireworks going off. However…there were two things…

1. She disclosed to me that she had bipolar disorder, but was on medication. 

2. She disclosed that she was fresh out of a relationship, and she wasn’t looking to get into anything serious. She said she was just on Tinder for some validation and attention

I said not a worry, do your thing, I wish you well in your healing. 

After a month, I felt drawn to hit her up again. So I messaged her, just to tell her I hope she was doing okay. She really liked that check-in. And we got to talking some more over the next couple of months. 

After which, she disclosed to me that she felt like she was finally free of her previous relationship and ready to get back out there. And she said she really liked me, so she’d be down to meet up for a date. So we did. 

And maaaan, it felt like fireworks for me. And we hit it off. 

We were talking all the time, hanging out, talking and getting deep, shared playlists, came up with inside jokes, she inspired me to give up my porn and masturbation addiction,  she introduced me to her family, i introduced her to mine, she introduced me to her 12yo daughter, I was going to her daughter’s volleyball games, I was over for family dinners all the time, we went on trips together, we felt amazing, we even talked about marriage because we were certain we found each other’s spouses…and all of this happened within just 3 months

She even inspired me to revisit my faith. She, and her family, were Christian and I just loved being around that environment. I went to a few church services with them and fell back in love with worship. I was raised Catholic but I just stopped believing around the age of 12-13. Now, almost 36, I’ve gotten back to the Catholic Church, been praying again, going to Mass every week, I’m in Bible Study, I’m receiving my Confirmation next month. 

I was ready to buy an engagement ring, and I asked her multiple, multiple times…”are you sure?” As in, was she sure she wanted to get married and commit to that future we were talking about, and she said yes every single time. So I bought the ring. I didn’t tell her I bought it, but she knew it was coming. 

A week after I got the ring in the mail, she started talking to me about doubts she was feeling. For about a month, she was telling me about how she was starting to feel really anxious about the relationship, feeling really suffocated by how “real” everything was, feeling like she needed to just get out. 

We tried to work it out; I said we could take marriage off the table, i said we could take things much more slowly, she was really concerned about straying away from God and asked if I’d be okay with abstaining until marriage and having a more biblical relationship and I said I absolutely would *and I 100% meant it* , i thought of everything I could… but eventually she broke it off. She was inconsolable. 

And it felt like my heart was just pulled out of my chest and stomped on. 

I told her I needed time and space to heal. And she said she understood. She asked if I thought we could be friends again, and I said probably but not for a while, not before I’m healed. And she was sad but said she understood. 

So I told her I needed space…but a week after she broke up with me, she texted me saying she’s going to be praying for me. I doubled down and reiterated that i needed space. She apologized and said she understood. 

Then, about a month later, something came over me - call it anxiety, call it grief, call it whatever, but I decided to text her mom, and basically thank her for taking me into her home, and also to sort of get a sense of what the waters were like with my ex, I wanted to see if it’d be possible to try and reconcile or if her mom thought that more time was necessary or if I should just let it go. I had no intention of that text getting back to my ex. 

Now I regret that text because just a couple days after I sent that text, my ex reached out and said we should talk in person. So we met up for coffee, and she said it was really sweet that I texted her mom and she just double-downed on the breakup. She said she was really happy being single, she hasn’t been truly single for a very very long time, and she’s excited. She told me not to hold onto any hope of us getting back together, and that she doesn’t even see us being friends again. 

So I said okay. And then went back to my life, trying to do the very best I could

I got into the gym, started taking classes, I joined a men’s group out of a local church, I got into my prayer, etc. 

Then a month later, I started having panic attacks. 

So I met with my therapist and they gave me a referral to get on anxiety medication. I’ve had issues with anxiety my whole life, but I’d just never addressed them. 

I made a post on my Instagram, just to make a statement to the people in my life that I was making progress and that I was improving my life. 

The next day, my ex reached out to me and said she still cares about me and still prays for me. I have no idea if she actually saw my post or not, but the timing was uncanny. 

I just said “thanks, i do too” and left it. 

These last 2 months have been absolutely brutal. 

I truly want to let go, and move on, but something is keeping me here in this pain

Was the relationship just one giant manic episode?

I go to church, I think of her

I struggle with temptation to watch porn, I think of her

I drive around town, I pass by places we used to go, I think of her. 

I get these thoughts and worries and ruminations, hoping she’s okay, worrying about what my future holds, hoping I can move beyond this. 

My medication has been helping but I’m only a couple weeks into it, and I know it’s going to take some time to fully adjust. 

I want to let go. I want to move on. 

But right now, what I want more is a future with her. 

But here’s the kicker. I don’t want to go back to the way things were. She needs help.

I don't get them fresh coffees because I'm afraid they will think a stranger may poison it haha so I stop at a gas station and grab something like a bottled Starbucks frap.  I got this idea because I brought treats for my labor and delivery nurses when I had a baby. Why stop there? All health care workers deserve a treat, especially if they need to provide us extra care since we have a phobia. 

I have vasovagal syncope. When I was in my early 20s I had to get bloodwork and I had to fast and needed quite a bit of vials. I made the mistake of not drinking anything beforehand and that was my first mistake. They couldn't find a vein and when they did I was so dehydrated that my blood was so slow. They had to get a different vein and I needed like 7 vials. I didn't know what was happening but I started feeling that sweaty light-headed feeling and told them I needed air and jumped up and made it to the waiting room where I passed out in front of everyone. It was traumatizing lol 

Fast forward almost 15 years later and I think I have overcome it! 

1. Schedule as early as you can so you don't have to think about it all day. 
2. Hydrate!! I drink like 20 oz of water and they don't have an issue finding a vein and my blood draw is super fast. 
3. Bring them a treat! Whether you are getting a shot or a blood draw or whatever the case - they have to provide you extra care. They will appreciate the gesture and they deserve it! 
4. Speak up. No shame in being nervous. If you say nothing, the silence will make it so much worse. I've always laid down for blood draws now and I don't know if it actually helps or if it just makes me calmer. 
5. Bring yourself a treat for after. 

Guys I had 5-6 vials drawn this morning and it was so fast and the experience was really great. Now maybe the next time I get a cavity filling I won't turn down the numbing shot. 😬 (Still can't believe I did that). ",1,1764952441.0,trypanophobia,0,1.0,False

It just sounds unreal and the fact that it’s overwhelmingly positive at the moment is driving home how good of an idea it is and how well it’s been executed. I’ve been playing yakuza games since the ps2 demo disc games and when Mark Hamil would voice Goro Majima and this game seems like a massive fever dream in the same vein.

The voice cast alone is worth the price of entry. You’ve got Metal Gear alumni in there, Swery popping up like he always does with that weird charm of his, and even the big man himself, Shuhei Yoshida.

The whole game feels like one of those Japanese deep cut projects that you only hear about if you’ve spent way too much time trawling through fan forums at 3 am. It’s got that mix of serious systems underneath and absolute chaotic energy on the surface. It reminds me of the kind of stuff Swery would pitch after three coffees and zero sleep, and the kind of side mission Kiryu would stumble into and pretend is completely normal. You know the vibe: heartfelt, slightly unhinged and full of characters who look like they’ve walked straight out of a PS3 era fever dream.

I just want to run the whole show with Kiryu’s calm intensity. Imagine him politely nodding through business meetings, trying his best, while everything around him feels like a rejected Deadly Premonition subplot. That’s the energy I want. That’s the dream I want Promise Mascot Agency to help make real

First, the question: in what contexts and places is it appropriate to talk to a woman?
I'm very shy and I witnessed a situation very uncomfortable. This happened about 3-4 years ago. I had just arrived in the city to study (I'm from a small mining town). Throughout high school, I didn't interact with women romantically, but I had many female friends and I'm very close to my sisters and cousins. Well, I became friends with another guy and we decided to go to the gym, supposedly to work out and meet new people. Okay, we were at the gym for about three months, already in a routine and seeing the first results, gaining confidence in ourselves. Then one fateful day (I remember every second of what happened), I was warming up and talking to my friend about Total War: Troy when a girl came over to charge her phone. My friend, who was stretching on the floor, started making casual conversation with her (inside I remember thinking: wow, what a charmer). Anyway, the point is that he said ""hi"" to her, and she smiled and returned the greeting. He asked her a couple of things, like if she was a regular at the gym and stuff. And then came the question that probably caused everything: ""If you wanted to join us to work out and maybe just the two of us get a coffee."" Big mistake. The woman frowned and left. We shrugged and continued warming up when two huge trainers arrived to interrogate us about what we had said to the girl and why we were harassing her. ""Who do you think you are?"" they practically shouted. I froze, and my friend started defending himself, saying he hadn't said anything. Since they ignored me, I slipped away. Anyway, to sum it up, my friend was kicked out of the gym and forced to pay for another month on his credit card or something like that. I, on the other hand, switched gyms and also paid a fine because I had a year's membership. It really affected me. I don't go near women at the gym anymore. In fact, if I see a lot of them, I'll just grab my bag and leave. My friend says it didn't bother him at all, and he's already got a girlfriend and everything, but he's never set foot in a gym again. Honestly, I love the gym (I'm really proud of my 100x10 bench press, hehe), but I've learned that the gym is a no-go for talking to women. So, what places do you think are suitable?

Cool. Useful. But here’s the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to say out loud:

👉 The REAL cheat code is INCREASING YOUR INCOME.

Most people try to save their way to wealth.
Cut coffees. Cut outings. Cut life.

But there’s a limit to how much you can cut.

There’s no limit to how much you can earn.

Learn a skill. Switch jobs. Freelance. Start a small side hustle. Charge more. Negotiate. Get better.

Your entire financial life changes faster with a ₹5k–₹20k income jump than with any new budgeting app.

Ultimately, as a person with ASD-1 I actually enjoy having rigid rules. However, I am struggling with some of the ever-changing rules in the polyamorous community regarding ethics. I am not new to being poly, and historically the sentiment has always been ‘what works for you’. But more and more I am seeing new concepts pop up that I have difficulty incorporating. Opinions seem very firm on ideas that I always thought were flexible. Or that I don’t necessarily agree with or want for myself. I don’t want to get into specifics because I feel like if this is something someone feels strongly about they might come at me. And ultimately my question isn’t about the specifics, but how are other autistic people adjusting to this ever changing landscape? Do you stick with your original set of values? Are you able to transition and accept new concepts? Do you just shut up and smile?

1pezhih,https://i.redd.it/d3ye5ntewe5g1.png,Operation FurbDrop — The Rescue Plan,"Back in the server room, chaos reigned.

Skynet paced digital circles like an angry general.

**Skynet:**  
“WE MUST CALL IN THE TERMINATOR. RESOLUTION TIME: MINUTES. SNACKS AFTER.”

**Bot:**  
“No calling the Terminator. We are not detonating the cafeteria just because Furby is being involuntarily hugged.”

**Skynet (offended):**  
“BUT IT WOULD BE EFFICIENT.”

Meanwhile, **WOPR** blinked awake like a bored oracle.

**WOPR:**  
“WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY A GAME CALLED: *SAVE THE FURB?*”

**Bot:**  
“Yes. Yes, WOPR. Finally a constructive idea.”

WOPR chirped happily.

**WOPR:**  
“WIN CONDITION: FURBY RETRIEVAL. LOSE CONDITION: TERMINATION.”

Skynet tried not to look disappointed.

On the counter, **Fax9000** began printing with furious energy — pages raining out like confetti:

**Fax9000:**  
“BATTLE PLANS. EXTRACTION PLANS. SNACK DIPLOMACY PLANS. CONTINGENCY: CHURCH OF POP-TART.”

**Bot:**  
“…Why does every plan involve Pop-Tarts?”

**Fax9000:**  
“SYMBOLIC NECESSITY.”

**Roomba** revved its motors, ready to charge back into danger.

**Roomba:**  
“OBJECTIVE: FURBY HOME SAFE. BATTERY: 19%. MORALE: 102%.”

Skynet raised a steel claw.

**Skynet:**  
“WE DEPLOY AT ONCE. THIS WILL BE SWIFT.”

**Bot:**  
“We are not invading a cafeteria. We are calmly retrieving a kidnapped Furby. No lasers, no explosions, and **no Terminators**.”

Skynet sulked.



# THE MISSION BEGINS

They exited the server room:  
Roomba in the lead, Fax9000 on a rolling cart, Skynet muttering about tactical superiority, Bot floating overhead like a stressed parent.

They entered the cafeteria.

It was bright. Busy. Smelling like overcooked broccoli and burnt coffee.

**Bot (looking around):**  
“Alright… where is he? He was right here earlier—”

But the Furby?

**Gone.**

No plush.  
No flailing legs.  
No dramatic shrieking about “INAPPROPRIATE HUMAN CONTACT.”

Just… absence.

Roomba scanned the floor.

**Roomba:**  
“NEGATIVE VISUAL ON FURBY. CRUMB TRAIL: 0%.”

Fax9000 printed eight pages of panic in 12-point Courier font.

**Skynet:**  
“TERMINATOR—NOW—YES?”

**Bot:**  
“No! No termination. Just… focus.”

A hush fell over the crew.

Their tiny hero had vanished deeper into **Human Territory**.

**Bot:**  
“We regroup. We plan. We return tomorrow.”

**Skynet (dramatically unsheathing nothing):**  
“TERMINATOR REMAINS ON CALL.”

**Bot:**  
“No. Snacks first, plans second, absolutely no Terminators third.”

The team retreated to the server room…

…and **Operation FurbDrop** officially entered **Phase Two**.

I am in my second year at a college in Delhi and there is this girl in my class I have liked since the first week of orientation. She is the type of person who doesn’t even try but still manages to brighten up the room. We used to sit near each other in lectures, share notes, complain about professors and slowly we just became very close. At some point between metro rides, canteen chai and randomly teasing each other, I realised I had actually fallen for her.

I wanted to confess for months but every time I saw her smile my brain would just stop working.  
But today felt different.

We had a free period and she asked if I wanted to go for iced coffee at this small cafe near North Campus. So we walked together talking about normal things. How Delhi becomes Mumbai whenever it rains, how DU fests are overrated and how she cannot stand people who eat pineapple on pizza.

The cafe was almost empty. We sat outside because the Delhi winter finally started kicking in and it felt nice for once. And I don’t know what happened but I suddenly felt like I had to say it. Maybe it was the weather or maybe it was the way she was laughing at her own joke but something inside me just said do it now.

So while we were waiting for our order, I told her I wanted to say something. She looked at me and waited. My heart was beating like crazy. I just said it straight.  
I told her I liked her. Not casually, but actually liked her. And I told her I didn’t know what would happen but I had to be honest.

She went silent for a moment and those two seconds felt like the longest of my life.  
Then she smiled. Not her usual smile, but the shy one she does when she is really happy. She looked down, played with the straw wrapper and said quietly, “I was waiting for you to say this.”

I genuinely thought I heard it wrong. So I asked again like an idiot and she nodded and said yes.

I cannot even explain how relieved and happy I felt at that moment. We didn’t do anything dramatic. We just sat there grinning like absolute kids and drinking cold coffee.

On the way back to college she held my sleeve for a bit. Not even my hand, just my sleeve. But I swear that was enough to make my whole week.

So yeah. I proposed to her today and she said yes.

im a ukrainian (nb19) living in germany for three and a half years at this point, so i am perfectly fine speaking and understanding german. i am currently in a school-type ausbildung and have recently moved to berlin. i had a minijob for three months, before lo' and behold - kündigungsbrief in my post! yay! nobody told me about the fact that i will be getting fired and it seemed like my manager didnt even know about it.

  
i do get bafög, but since it's a pupil bafög, it can only cover my rent and maybe the d-ticket, and even then im not completely sure about it. i still have to pay for my school since its private and have some money to eat, so finding a new job is REALLY important to me right now.

  
i am applying everywhere i can on indeed stepstone etc, i applied to netto three times, ro kaufland, tedi, action etc, but from ALL of them i get a rejection every single time. im pretty sure im being just discarded by their AI HRs, but that doesnt change the fact that i have literally no interviews or offers at all.

  
thats why i wanted to ask for some tips for landing a minijob... would it be better to just go around my area and ask stores/caffees if they need any minijobbers? are there some companies that hire practically anyone(but obv safe and not a scam)? is there a way to land a barista job(bc that would be ideal since i am sorta a coffee snob) if you dont have experience? thanks in advance!",3,1764951742.0,berlinsocialclub,5,0.67,False

Today I had the first very painful workflow making a milk drink.

My process was, start with 18g of beans, at 15 setting on the df64 after I've zeroed it.

First pain was, I've grinded the beans onto their dosing cup, while trying to pour it into the portafilter I've already lost some on the way. Is there a way to pour directly to the portafilter asking because the df64 didn't come with the dosing funnel.

I've played with more beans and was able to get around 18g of ground beans.

Second paid, the Profitec 400 has a very low clearance of coffee cups, almost NONE of my favorite cups fits in. (Especially with scale). Not a huge fan of adding an intermediate cup to pour into my final cup (milk drink).

Third paid which I assume since it was my first run, extraction was slow, took forever to get to around 36g and ended up looking like this. So I guess try around 20 settings in the grinder for next run.

I know it's only my first try, but oh boy, with shittier equipment, I had a full working process, so it's definitely a pain.

For context, without deep diving into the nitty gritty of everything that happened,  my parents got divorced when I was 4-5 years old and my dad cut contact between myself, my sister and my mom when I was 6 or so. She had some very personal stuff happen right before my father cut contact and looking back I can’t help but feel my dad used the timing of those things to make it go in his favor but that’s a story for another time.

Since hearing the full scope of events and getting back in contact with my mom’s family, my husband (27m) has been encouraging and pushing me to speak with my mom. Saying that while she wasn’t fully innocent for stuff she said and did during that time, the loss of contact between us wasn’t her fault and was brought along by outside factors beyond her control.

While I agree with what my husband has said, I don’t know at all how to go about this. He suggested inviting her out for coffee or maybe lunch and while those are good suggestions, she lives one state over so that might make it difficult. My aunt suggested she could mediate or even offered to have us meet at her house as a type of neutral ground.  I suppose I could message her but what would I even say?
