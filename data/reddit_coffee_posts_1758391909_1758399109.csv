1nm88az,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm88az,"25M, USA, Spokane County","Hi! The name's Jack. I'm looking for gals to go on casual dates with for the purpose of pursuing something more serious (gotta get a good read on people before committing). I currently work for a non-profit in town as a donation pick up driver (yes, I see many, many cool things). At least, that's what it says I do on paper, but I do much more than just picking up donations. At the end of the year, I am getting back into EMT work.

I'm always up for a cup of coffee or going out for a drink and a good conversation is always an enjoyable accompaniment to that.

Some of my other interests include:  
Hiking, backpacking/camping, hammocking, baking bread, watching really good movies that provide fantastic discussions (e.g. Shrek, Fiddler on the Roof, Peanut Butter Falcon) \[bad movies such as Birdemic: Shock & Terror or Airplane vs. Volcano are also a pleasure\], sword fighting, having long, solid talks with people, games (tabletop, RPG, and videogames), chess, folk/contra dances, and visiting museums and art galleries.

I'm a bit of a wandering soul, although not by choice. Grew up in China for ten years, then Canada for eight, and then made my way to the US. Never lived in any town longer than 5 years, although I'm hoping to beat my record here in Spokane. My parents were foreign workers in China. I myself grew up in a Baptist family. I made the choice to submit to God when I was in jr. high (summer of 2013), but had always accepted the faith of Christianity as a fact of life. I had a fairly significant deconstruction of my Baptist beliefs in 2023 and reconstruction into something different that I'm not sure how to put words to (not liberal theology just to make that clarification). I've been attending the Anglican church I am currently at for a short amount of time (less than a year), but I've found good people there, been able to have productive conversations about my beliefs there, and find much good health in the life of the Church.

Deal breakers for me are smoking (pipe tobacco and cigars are exceptions), weed, not wanting children in the future (I'd like to be a dad thanks), and having children of your own (but not be a dad that fast). I'd prefer to have a decent amount of crossover in interests, (3 or 4 shared interests) and being able to be outdoors with other people is pretty important to me so it would be nice to meet someone who enjoys being outside.

Looking for people between 20-30 y/o.

I'd be willing to relocate for the right person, but I would really like someone who is able to be a part of my community (as in already nearby)

I’m an UK/EU national who has been living in the UK for the past 10 years. I’ve been wanting to move elsewhere for a long time now, and I plan to do so within the next 2 years. I won’t go into the reasons for leaving, but what’s held me back is not knowing where to go next. I don’t want to return to my home country (Italy), so I’m looking for fresh options. Job-wise, if I stay within Europe or even the MENA region I can continue in my current role, so I am focusing on this part of the world for now. 

My priorities:

* Good air quality year-round (very important)
* Not car-centric: ideally a medium-sized city or town with large pedestrianised areas (also very important)
* Clean and safe 
* Amenities such as coffee shops, cinemas, libraries, bookshops
* International schools if not in an English-speaking country

Places I’ve considered so far:

* Netherlands (Breda, Utrecht, Maastricht): probably the most sensible option on paper. I am aware of the housing crisis but if I sell my property in London, I should hopefully find something decent in one of these cities. Upsides include subsidised international schools and possibly the 30% ruling. 
* Belgium (Ghent): visited once and liked it, but the high taxes worry me. I prefer Bruges but no international school there. 
* Austria (Vienna): really liked it when I lived there as a student 20 years ago, but not sure what it’s like now. I am also concerned about the political climate.
* France (Fontainebleau) 
* Luxembourg: never been and reviews online seem very mixed..

If anyone has suggestions within Europe or the MENA region that might fit my criteria, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences. I know this place probably doesn’t exist, but I thought I’d ask here in case anyone knows a hidden gem!

Two moths ago, they finally hired someone for that role — she(45F) was supposed to be my manager and had “years of experience.” I was honestly relieved.

But from day one, she refused to do a site tour, never took notes, and wouldn’t do tasks (“I’ll do it later” “You do it now and I will next time” — but when later or next time came she still would not do it). She didn’t know basic things like Excel, printing, or even copy-paste. Colleagues tried training her too, but we all agreed: she just didn’t want to work.

On top of that, she told me she had urinary incontinence, but she wasn’t managing it at all. Instead, she drank 6 coffees a day and no water, wore the same pants 2–3 days in a row (even though her chair was stained so her clothes were too), and barely went to the restroom (twice in a 10-hour shift). Every day the smell got worse, the bathroom smelled too, and the cleaning staff kept threatening to quit.

I was exasperated, so I complained to management every single day and my colleagues 2 or 3 times a week. Meanwhile, she kept blowing up our phones ( mine and our colleagues’) with dozens of calls and Teams messages asking the same questions we had already explained — without actually doing the work.

Eventually, management moved me to the bigger site and decided they’ll fire her once they replace her.

I never wanted her job, I just wanted her to actually do hers. My friends think I overreacted and basically got her fired, but honestly I felt like I had no choice.

So, AITA?

As the title says, I’m 43f (been with my partner for 20 years) and we’ve been through years of infertility treatments - multiple surgeries, a year of horrendous medication for ovulation induction, 9 rounds of IVF, 3 miscarriages which were devastating. We were lucky enough to have 2 kids out of it but it really took its toll on me mentally and physically. We’re older anyway due to it taking 8 years to first conceive - I had my son at 38 and my daughter at 40. We are just coming out of that all consuming baby/toddler phase and feels like we’re regaining ourselves a bit.

Anyway, I have severe pcos so rarely get a period but I recently got the familiar nausea at the thought of coffee, followed by the familiar weird rash I get when pregnant. Took a test and here we are. I’ve had a scan and am 7 weeks. All looking good with a heartbeat. But we have no idea what to do. I mean I’m almost 44, I’d have a 5 year old at 50. I’m tired, we both have decent jobs but live in a really high cost of living area so are in a 2 bed apartment which is already pushed for space. We gave all our baby stuff away. I’m tired. Pregnancy almost killed me last time and our daughter almost didn’t make it through the birth. We don’t have family close by so very little help and childcare for 2 already wipes us out each month. We’d need a new car, probably a new home! When I went for the scan I just lost my shit, all this trauma came flooding back and I just can’t do it. My partner is heavily leaning towards termination and I know 100% that’s the logical thing to do but I’m just so lost. I feel so much anger that this is happening now instead of 10 years ago when it could have saved a decade of heartache. I know I’m stuck in a pity party I’m just so overwhelmed with the situation and terrified of making the wrong decision.

If you can’t pass, you will have a generally happier life if you don’t transition.","I understand that some transgender individuals who don’t pass insist, “My pronouns are mandatory.” Respectfully, I’ll use “she” when I’m around them to keep the peace, but like most people, I’ll call them a man when they’re not there if they don’t pass as a woman. Respecting one’s pronouns depends on whether they pass. If one is a biological male and feel like they’re really a woman, all the power to them. It’s a tough road, and I support them doing whatever they can to be a woman. 

But they gotta pass as such. If they want to keep their original genitalia, I support that decision. Or if they want to get the full surgery, I respect that too.. But when people look at them, there shouldn’t be a question that they’re a woman. If they can tell they’re a man, they shouldn’t expect pronouns to be respected. 

How can we respect your pronouns if you’re not even respecting your own identity? If you won’t shave your  beard, why should anyone see you as a woman?

And then there’s some trans people who do everything they can to pass and never will. And that’s the brutal truth that no one wants to talk about. Look at Lily Tino—they got hormones, feminization surgery, and everything else possibly done to transition to a woman. No facial hair, girly hairstyle, and the hormones worked when it comes to their body shape. But the voice? It just sounds like a flamboyant nerdy guy. Face, jaw, even the eyes, look manly. Some people just don’t pass. If you’re a man in a woman’s body and can’t pass, you shouldn’t be trans. These people should deal with their gender dysphoria with therapy, and find a way to accept their body how it actually is. They’ll be happier than trying to pass and getting laughed at behind their back. People say, “If you don’t accept my identity, you’re out of my life.” Fine, but you can’t outrun human nature. As much as people like to say they don’t care what others think, it’s not true. It’s human nature to care what other others think. And when others think badly of you, no matter how much you try to say otherwise, that hurts.. You can act like it doesn’t , but when you’re grabbing coffee, pumping gas, or working, you face the public. What’s easier? Them seeing you as normal or as an obvious man trying to be a woman and mocking you, quiet or loud? A trans person who doesn’t pass is gonna have a shittier, sadder life than if they just accept their body. 

It’s a harsh reality, but that’s how it is.

A couple of months after the first time, it happened again because he left chocolate on the side and went to bed, so she had access to it all night and obviously ate all of it, which meant another very scary trip to the emergency vet, being terrified she would need extensive inpatient treatment or die, which was a very real possibility. 

We’ve had multiple scares since where the dog has almost eaten more chocolate or other food we both know is deathly toxic to a dog her size because he’s left them out completely unattended and just walked away or gone to bed, two weeks ago I noticed a container of food she definitely would have eaten open on a coffee table that he'd left out when he went to bed and we had a huge fight because he acted really nonchalant about it and kept making excuses as to why he’d done it. I told him that her safety is a hard line for me, he knows how serious I feel about this.

Last night it happened again, and the dog literally had it in her mouth, I walked past and noticed and managed to get it away from her just in time. Every time this happens I’m extremely upset with him, we fight, he apologies, swears he’ll never do it again and then he just … does it again. He can’t explain why. Like he actually doesn’t seem to know why he’s incapable of being careful. I've banned him from having dark chocolate in the house which feels like a ridiculous thing to have to do, but that hasn't stopped him from leaving other stuff out that could easily kill her. He's fully fully aware that all of these things are extremely dangerous, but he seems convinced he wouldn't actually ever be responsible for her illness/death even though we’ve just been really lucky so far.

It makes me feel completely crazy because there’s nothing I can do to stop him from putting her life and health in danger. Ever since that first scare I can’t trust him at all to take precautions because it literally does not occur to him to think about her safety, I asked if he thought about her at all when he left the food container out and went to bed and he said honestly, no. He loves the dog, but that isn’t enough to make him stop and think about her. I am a forgetful person, I am not perfect and do stupid things all the time but not something like this, repeatedly and knowingly, which we both know puts the dog’s life at risk. Even if I'm at a friend's house who has no pets, if I see a dangerous food for dogs I automatically go to pick it up and move it out of reach and then remember I don't need to. We both have ADHD, his is medicated.

It’s getting to the point that I’m genuinely reconsidering our entire future because I can’t continue to live with someone who would be so thoughtless about a beloved pet’s life, I genuinely don’t trust him to look after her when I’m out of the house. I also just don’t think I can have kids with someone I can’t even trust to take care of a dog. At the same time, I understand that he's not making these mistakes out of malice, and that he does love her. Am I overreacting?",5,1758398256.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.86,False

I never thought a coffee maker could be such a fuss-free experience, but this one proved me wrong. Brewing a solid 12 cups of coffee is a breeze with its simple one-switch operation. This is not a machine overloaded with high-tech gadgets, nor does it try to be overly fancy. Instead, it focuses on getting the basic task of brewing done efficiently. It’s not overwhelming for those mornings when your brain is half-asleep and all you need is a strong cup of coffee to kickstart the day.

**Ease of Use**  
One thing that stood out during my first use was just how simple it is to set up. You put your ground coffee in the reusable filter, pour water using the visible water window (no guessing games), flip the switch, and the brewing begins. This no-frills approach is something I appreciate. There’s no overcomplication, no menu to scroll through. Everything is manual and straightforward. Even my dad, who isn't exactly tech-savvy, managed to figure it out without asking any questions—now that’s saying something!  

[See Mr. Coffee SK12-RB deals on Amazon now.](https://eregy.com/p/b002yi49h6/)

**Grab-A-Cup Feature**  
Have you ever had to hover impatiently by your coffee machine, waiting for the brewing process to finish? This situation happened frequently before I got the coffee machine. With the Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature, it’s as if this machine read my mind. Mid-brew interruptions are no problem. I can pour myself a quick cup without spills or messes, and the process continues smoothly once the carafe is replaced.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning coffee machines often feels like more work than it’s worth, but I was pleasantly surprised here. The lift-and-clean filter basket makes cleanup a snap. Unlike other machines I’ve used, which require awkward dismantling, this one gets the job done with minimal hassle. That said, the white color does show stains a bit more prominently, so regular cleaning is key to keeping it looking presentable.

**Boons**  
- Straightforward manual operation, perfect for those who prefer simplicity.  
- Dual water window ensures precision and prevents overflow.  
- The Auto Pause feature eliminates waiting for the entire brewing cycle.  

**Pitfalls**  
- The white body stains easily and needs thorough attention to maintain its appearance.  
- It doesn’t come with advanced functions like programmable brewing or strength settings.  

**Market Rivals**  
I’ve owned a programmable coffee machine before with multiple personalization features, but honestly, I didn’t use half of them. Sure, other brands like Cuisinart or Hamilton Beach boast high-end models with fancy timers and intense brew strengths, but they also demand more attention and maintenance. Compared to its pricier peers, this coffee maker might feel a bit basic, yet it hits all the marks for purposeful, everyday use. Hamilton Beach machines, for instance, usually come with single-serve pods in addition to brew pots, but if you’re primarily brewing for a group, they don’t offer the same convenience as this large pot.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Discussing whether this product is worth its cost, I think it certainly provides great value for the money. A coffee maker with basic functions but excellent reliability is hard to beat, especially at this price point. Flashier machines might tempt you with additional features, but for me, practical performance outweighs unnecessary bells and whistles.

1nm7uo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1nm7uo4/explore_if_the_best_coffee_maker_by_cuisinart/,Explore if the best coffee maker by Cuisinart truly delivers,"The Cuisinart Brew Central 14-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker LK6565000C has become my consistent morning companion over the past few weeks. As someone who cannot function without the aroma of fresh coffee, this programmable coffee maker promised to deliver, and it hasn’t disappointed. From its sleek silver-and-black stainless steel body to its extensive features, there’s a lot to unpack about this drip coffee machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is modern, blending seamlessly with my kitchen appliances, thanks to its polished stainless steel exterior and silver-black color combination. It's slightly larger than my previous coffee maker, but its slim 5-inch width fits snugly on the countertop without taking up too much space. The backlit blue LCD is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, as it displays settings clearly even in low-light mornings. There's a glass carafe included with an ergonomic handle that stays cool, which makes pouring safe and comfortable. While it looks great and feels sturdy, its 7-pound weight does make it slightly heftier than I expected.

**Ease of Use**  
Getting started wasn’t daunting at all. Its fully automatic operation offers straightforward usability. With buttons that respond effortlessly, I quickly set the programmable 24-hour brew start. I often leave for work early, so I appreciate the convenience of waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee without lifting a finger. The water reservoir has a clear-view window ensuring you fill it precisely, preventing overflows. The addition of a charcoal water filter was a thoughtful touch as it removes water impurities while enhancing the flavor.

**Highlights**  
- Fully programmable 24-hour advance start  
- Adjustable auto-off and brew strength options: regular or bold  
- Self-cleaning mode with a ""time-to-clean"" indicator  
- Heating plate with temperature adjustments to keep coffee warm for hours  

[Check Cuisinart LK6565000C price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b0bpc31zdf/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
When tested, the performance of this coffee maker was impressive. It brews up to 14 cups in a single session, making it perfect for family gatherings or office settings. I often switch between the regular and bold settings depending on my mood, and the flavor results have been robust and satisfying. The brew-pause feature is handy on days I'm impatient—I can pour a cup mid-brew and still enjoy a drip-free experience. Plus, the adjustable heating plate has become my ally when I need a warm second cup hours later.

**Strong Points**  
- Large 14-cup capacity suitable for households and small offices  
- Brew-pause feature is a lifesaver for early sips  
- Digital display makes navigation intuitive  
- Durable stainless steel finish adds visual appeal to the kitchen  

**Areas of Concern**  
A couple of slight hiccups came up during my time using it. Here are a few points to note:  
- Despite the 14-cup capacity, the brewing process can feel slower when making large quantities.  
- Cleaning the metal coffee basket and water reservoir requires patience, especially to remove fine coffee residues.  
- The machine isn’t the quietest, with noticeable noise during the heating process.  

**Competing Products**  
Several coffee makers on the market compete head-to-head with this model, notably brands like Keurig and Breville. I’ve tried a Breville Precision Brewer before, which offers even more temperature customization and a faster brew time but came at a significantly higher cost. On the other hand, Keurig delivers single-serve coffee quicker, but you lose the larger capacity and the 24-hour programmable feature. The Cuisinart model strikes a balance by being cost-effective while still delivering the versatility of brewing options and larger output.

**Smart Spending**  
For anyone who drinks coffee daily and loves hosting morning brunches or needs office caffeine solutions, this machine lives up to its value. The price-to-quality ratio is solid, given how much it offers in terms of both capacity and programmability. It might not be the cheapest, but its durability and multiple features give proper justification for the investment. Not to mention, it looks far more premium than its peers in the same price bracket.

1nm7ph4,https://i.redd.it/03o2bz24jdqf1.jpeg,When The Past Came Knocking,"

Chapter 1
 In the third year of our marriage, Landon Siebert suddenly regained his memory.
 He remembered the woman he once loved but could never have—Victoria Gunther.
 Victoria wept as she begged me to give him back to her.
 Landon, unable to bear her tears, stood up for her. ""Coraline Palmore, if we're talking about who came first, you're the one who took her place.""
 I let out a sigh. A man hung up on another woman is just like chocolate smeared with dirt—you can only throw it away.
 ***
 Landon got into a car accident.
 Over the phone, his assistant spoke in a panicked rush, urging me to get to the hospital immediately, sounding like it was a real emergency.
 My mind raced with all sorts of terrible scenarios as I hurried there, my hands and feet growing cold with anxiety.
 When I pushed open the door to the hospital room, my hand was still trembling uncontrollably.
 Thank God.
 None of the horrors I'd imagined came true.
 Landon sat upright on the bed, looking a little worse for wear but otherwise unharmed.
 The weight in my chest finally eased.
 Only then did I realize, the room was far too crowded.
 Nearly all of Landon's childhood friends had gathered around his bed.
 When they saw me, a strange expression flickered across their faces, as if my arrival was somehow out of place.
 Landon glanced up at me, his brows furrowing slightly. ""Who told you to come?""
 In all our years together—one year dating, three years married—I had never heard him speak to me with such coldness. I froze where I stood.
 ""She was worried about you. Why are you being so harsh?""
 A gentle, soothing voice interrupted.
 A woman I'd never seen before stood up from beside Landon's bed.
 She was tall, with pale skin.
 She looked like a handful of fresh snow—radiant, delicate, and heartbreakingly beautiful.
 ""You must be Landy's wife, right?""
 She gazed at me from across the room, her eyes rimmed red. ""Please, I'm begging you—could you give him back to me?""
 A faint buzzing filled my ears.
 Strangely, my first instinct wasn't to ask who she was, but to look at Landon.
 He didn't look at me.
 Instead, his eyes were fixed on her, a mix of pain and joy shining in them—as if he were staring at a treasure he'd lost and finally found again.
 ""Why are you begging her?""
 Someone shouted, ""If you hadn't let go back then, nobody else would be standing next to Landy! Vicky, don't worry, you're the only woman I'll ever recognize for Landy!""
 It felt like I'd been slapped across the face, my cheeks burning.
 I stared at Landon, desperate for some kind of explanation.
 Our eyes met, and for a moment he looked stunned, then quickly turned away in confusion.
 ""I guess I should introduce myself,"" the woman said softly. Her gentle voice revealed that she was Victoria Gunther or Vicky, Landon's ex-girlfriend.
 They met in high school and started dating in college, but broke up after graduation because Landon's parents didn't approve.
 When she reached the emotional part of her story, Victoria threw herself into Landon's arms, choking back tears. ""If I'd known you'd end up like this, I never would've left, no matter what.""
Chapter 2
 I have no idea how I managed to walk out of that hospital room.
 When I finally came to, a steaming latte was sitting in front of me.
 Landon's childhood friend, Robert Cronin, was looking at me with pity in his eyes.
 ""So, what are you going to do?""
 After Victoria suggested breaking up, Landon got into a car accident while driving over to try to patch things up.
 He spent a month in the ICU, and when he woke up, he'd lost his memory.
 To be precise, he'd forgotten Victoria.
 The coffee I drank seemed to turn into a heavy stone, dragging my stomach down, sinking deeper and deeper, until my insides felt twisted and tight.
 I remembered the first time I met Landon.
 It was at an art exhibit, both of us pausing in front of a print of moonlight shining over snowy mountains.
 He turned his head and looked at me, and the first thing he said was, ""You look familiar. Haven't we met somewhere before?""
 Later, I teased him for using such a cliché pickup line.
 Landon just laughed. ""It wasn't a pickup line. I meant it.""
 Back then, I didn't think much of it.
 ""Coraline, are you alright?"" Robert asked, his brows furrowed in concern.
 I wanted to say I was fine, but the words wouldn't come—I couldn't even name the feeling.
 Suddenly, I asked, ""Does Victoria like sweets?""
 It was some time after we started dating.
 I was stressed, rushing to finish a script before the deadline, completely frazzled.
 Landon sat quietly beside me, working on his own tasks.
 Watching me fidget and squirm, he chuckled softly. ""You're so anxious. I know a great way to help you unwind.""
 Before I could react, his soft lips brushed against mine.
 In the midst of our kiss, he gently nudged a hard candy into my mouth with his tongue.
 ""So you've been planning this all along!""
 My cheeks burned red, breathless as I covered my mouth and accused him.
 Landon laughed, voice low. ""Sea salt lemon flavor. Do you like it?""
 Truth was, he didn't even have much of a sweet tooth.
 But he always carried a few candies with him.
 I used to naively think it was because of me—a little romantic quirk between us.
 Robert took a sip of coffee, reading me like a book.
 ""She doesn't really like sweets, but she has low blood sugar. Landy got in the habit of keeping some candy on him for emergencies.""
 My tongue went numb and bitter.
 I couldn't say a word.
 All those sweet memories I thought belonged to me and Landon—they were just echoes of his past with Victoria.
 The thought slithered into my bones like a venomous snake, gnawing away at any peace I had left.
 Robert didn't give me a moment to catch my breath.
 ""To be honest, you and Victoria share a few subtle similarities. Maybe that's why Landy was drawn to you in the first place.
 ""Now that he's got his memory back and he's secured his place at the Siebert Group, who do you think matters more to him—you or Vicky?""
Chapter 3
 The answer wasn't hard to guess.
 I watched Landon and Victoria in the hospital room with icy detachment.
 She hung her head, sobbing quietly, her grief palpable.
 Landon kept his eyes down, refusing to look at her.
 But the way his fists clenched at his sides gave away everything he was feeling.
 It was as if he needed to hold himself back just to resist the urge to wrap her in his arms.
 After breaking up with Landon, Victoria had disappeared and only came back to the States last week.
 Just catching a glimpse of her profile on the road today sent Landon spiraling—he lost control and ended up crashing his car into the center divider.
 That was all it took for his memories to come flooding back.
 She hadn't done a thing.
 Just the sight of her from the side had shattered my marriage and everything I'd ever felt.
 ""Landy, why won't you look at me? Is it because you can't forgive me, or... are you afraid?""
 Victoria's words cut through the silence.
 She got the reaction she wanted—Landon let out a cold, bitter laugh. ""Why would I be afraid? You're the one who betrayed me first.""
 ""I didn't know how badly you were hurt back then. I didn't know you'd forgotten me...""
 She wiped away her tears, then suddenly lunged forward, arms reaching to embrace Landon.
 He reacted instantly, breaking free and shoving Victoria away hard as he gripped her shoulders.
 With a loud thud, Victoria slammed into the bed's safety rail, her face twisted in pain.
 But she seemed oblivious.
 Her eyes were glued to Landon's chest, exposed in the struggle.
 ""How... how is this possible?""
 She reached out with trembling hands, her fingertips barely brushing his skin before she recoiled, unable to bear it.
 Landon's expression darkened. His voice was rough and tight. ""There used to be a tattoo here.""
 Now, all that remained was a jagged scar.
 Landon once told me he couldn't remember how he got hurt.
 Whenever I suggested getting it fixed, he would get moody—either change the subject or tease me, asking if I actually found him repulsive.
 Now I understand.
 That scar was a relic of their love—a piece of the past he couldn't let go of, no matter how much he'd forgotten.
 Instinct kept him from erasing it.
 As if she couldn't take it anymore, Victoria threw herself into Landon's arms, clutching his neck, her shoulders shaking with uncontrollable sobs.
 This time, Landon didn't push her away.
 He slowly raised his hands, hesitating before finally bringing them together on her back.
 In that moment—
 He looked up, as if sensing something.
 Our eyes met in the air, catching each other off guard.
 I don't know how long we stared before he pressed his lips together and looked away first.
 A heartbeat later, as Victoria's cries echoed through the room, I saw a flicker of emotion cross Landon's face.
 Without hesitation, he wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close in a seamless embrace, his palm firm on her back.
 Her heartbroken sobs rang in my ears.
 My own eyes burned with sudden heat.
 I stepped back.
 Robert's question didn't need an answer anymore—I already knew.
Chapter 4
 Landon's injuries weren't serious.
 After the necessary tests and observation period, he was cleared to go home.
 When we arrived, Sofia—the housekeeper who managed our daily life—was busy setting the table for dinner.
 Landon walked in ahead of me, his tall frame hesitating almost imperceptibly in the entryway.
 I followed his gaze.
 There, I saw the ornament he'd gone to great lengths to bring back from a business trip, a delicate snow-capped mountain scene, tiny and intricate, with swirling flakes that drifted down when you turned it.
 Landon had always had a thing for snow.
 Our home was filled with decorations inspired by it.
 It felt like just yesterday that he'd promised, with absolute certainty, to take me to Switzerland on his next vacation.
 He knew a restaurant there—mulled wine so rich and fragrant, and if you stepped out onto the balcony, you'd be greeted by a panorama of towering, snow-covered peaks.
 He said I'd love it.
 A dull ache crept into my heart, slow and relentless.
 All I could feel was irony.
 Dinner was one of Sofia's carefully balanced meals, with a mix of proteins and veggies.
 But I barely touched my food.
 ""Landy learned to cook just to take care of Vicky.""
 Robert's words echoed in my mind, over and over.
 But Landon had never cooked for me.
 Of course, by the time we met, he was already a CEO, his days packed so tight that even our dates had to be confirmed by his assistant, sometimes multiple times.
 After we got married, Sofia was naturally reassigned to look after us, handling every aspect of our daily lives.
 There was never a chance for him to roll up his sleeves and cook.
 Noticing how little I'd eaten, Landon shot me a questioning look.
 On impulse, the words slipped out. ""I've never tasted your cooking.""
 Landon wiped his mouth with deliberate calm. ""What, Sofia's cooking doesn't suit you?""
 He raised a hand, and Sofia responded, approaching cautiously. ""Mrs. Siebert, if you have any comments, please let me know.""
 Suddenly, I felt weary and uninterested.
 The words that had been on the tip of my tongue for ages finally tumbled out. ""Landon, let's get a divorce.""
 The spoon clattered against the porcelain plate, the sound sharp and jarring.
 Landon's tone was flat. ""Reason?""
 ""Do I really need one? You and Victoria...""
 ""I don't want to hear that name.""
 Landon cut me off.
 He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths.
 When he opened them again, he was back to being the composed, collected Landon.
 ""Corrie, I know what happened today is hard for you to accept. It's hard for me too.""
 He paused, his fingers on the table trembling ever so slightly.
 ""I'm sorry you had to see what happened in the hospital.""
 He sighed, exhausted.
 ""Suddenly regaining all those memories—of course, my emotions are all over the place. But Victoria and I are history. Mrs. Siebert will only ever be you.""
 I didn't know if he was trying to convince me or himself, or if he just wanted to make his promise sound stronger.
 He reached out, taking my hand, his warm fingers gently stroking the back of mine.
 Looking straight at me, Landon repeated, ""Mrs. Siebert will only ever be you.""
 In the soft glow of the lamp, his eyes were clear, like a shallow lake reflecting my uncertainty.
 For a moment, I remembered our past.
 I remembered our wedding—how his hand trembled as he slipped the ring onto my finger, his eyes reddening before he pressed a reverent kiss to my knuckle.
 I remembered the first time he came to meet my family, so nervous he could barely function, tipsy after my dad made him drink, giggling as he buried his face in my neck and whispered, asking if he'd passed the test.
 I remembered just this morning, when he'd acted all mysterious, promising a surprise for our anniversary—one that would make me fall in love with him all over again.
 Maybe he sensed my hesitation.
 Landon spoke solemnly, ""Corrie, you can't just write me off so easily.""
 My heart fluttered.
 I lowered my gaze.
 Maybe it was the earnestness in his eyes or it was the flood of memories breaking through my defenses.
 I didn't argue.
Chapter 5
 For the next few weeks, Landon was exactly the same as always.
 If anything, he seemed even more loving and attentive than before.
 He replied to my texts instantly, kept me updated on everything, and, for the first time in ages, picked me up from work every night, always with gifts and bouquets in hand.
 It felt like our lives had settled back into their old rhythm, moving forward along the path we'd always planned.
 That is, until one of his friends threw a birthday party and invited us to join.
 Standing outside the private room, I overheard the heated debate inside and felt a wave of discomfort.
 ""What's Landy's deal? Didn't he get his memory back? Why isn't he getting back together with Vicky?""
 ""Get back together? He's married now!""
 ""Married? Please. She just swooped in while he was vulnerable. Landy's feelings for Vicky were real—he was head over heels for her. I said it before, if he ever regained his memory, he'd regret it sooner or later.""
 ""Regret what? Victoria dumped Landy first. He was in the hospital for ages, and if she really cared, she wouldn't have ignored him. She couldn't make it overseas, realized Landy was easy to manipulate, and came crawling back.""
 A warm hand covered mine.
 Landon patted my hand and fished a piece of candy from his pocket.
 My stomach churned with acid.
 I turned my head away.
 Landon paused, then tossed the candy into the trash as if it were nothing, sighing, ""Don't listen to their nonsense.""
 He pushed open the door.
 The lively argument fell silent for a moment.
 Seeing me walk in behind Landon, a few faces flickered with discomfort.
 ""Landy, why'd you bring her?""
 The one who'd been defending Victoria spoke first.
 Landon took his seat with calm indifference, raising an eyebrow. ""Wilfred, if you can't keep your mouth shut, maybe you should go home and learn how.""
 Wilfred Donovan scratched his head, stiffening his neck. ""Landy, you're really just going to forget about Vicky?""
 Everyone's eyes landed, subtly or not, on Landon and me.
 Landon acted like he hadn't heard, focusing all his attention on my fingers, absently tracing them with his own.
 When he finally spoke, his tone was casual, almost dismissive, ""What does she have to do with me? Why would I care?""
 ""But—""
 Wilfred started to protest, but was cut off by the sharp sound of something shattering.
 Victoria stood in the doorway, backlit by the hall light, her expression blank.
 At her feet, a glass ornament lay in pieces, shards glittering and slicing into her bare calf, where blood began to bead and trickle down.
 Sudden pain shot through my hand.
 I looked down—Landon was still holding my hand, his grip so tight his knuckles had gone white.
 ""Landon,"" I pulled free, ""you're hurting me.""
 Landon jolted as if shocked.
 He let go immediately, voice hoarse as he apologized, carefully avoiding Victoria's gaze at the door.
 The tension in the room was suffocating, like a balloon stretched to its breaking point.
 No one dared be the one to pop it—
 Except Victoria.
 She suddenly crouched down, nearly falling to her knees, desperately trying to gather the broken glass pieces, as if she could somehow put them back together.
 Wilfred rushed over. ""What are you doing? Get up! The floor's covered in glass.""
 Victoria stubbornly evaded him.
 She knelt on the floor, head tipped back, her eyes searching for Landon, grief etched deep in her face.
 ""Landy, it's broken... The last gift you ever gave me is gone...""
 Landon looked away, avoiding her gaze with obvious discomfort.
 But his whole body was tense, muscles straining like a bowstring pulled to its limit, trembling slightly.
 Victoria let out a hollow laugh, as if she'd finally given up.
 She rose slowly, staggering—
 And fell straight into Landon's arms.
 He'd already reached his breaking point the moment she laughed.
 Face set in grim determination, he rushed forward, catching her just before she collapsed.
 Victoria's face was pale, but her eyes burned with fierce intensity.
 ""I knew you'd catch me. You promised, no matter what, you'd always come back to me.""
 Landon scoffed, ""Who do you think you are?""
 But his arms didn't loosen around her, not even a little.
 Victoria struggled, ""Then let me go!""
 Landon held her tighter, his voice urgent. ""Calm down! You know you have hypoglycemia, and you're getting yourself worked up.""
 He freed one arm and instinctively reached for his pocket, then paused, confused.
 Victoria didn't notice his odd expression, her emotions spilling over. ""Didn't you just say we're nothing to each other? So why do you still care?""
 ""Victoria, you were the one who ended things.""
 Landon's voice was low, as if reminding himself.
 ""I had no choice!""
 Victoria suddenly covered her face, sobbing.
 ""What was I supposed to do? Your parents didn't want us together.
 ""You expected me to just watch you give up being the Siebert heir, throw away your future, grovel for investment money at dinner parties, and drink until your stomach bled?
 ""I couldn't bear to let you sacrifice your life for me! Do you think I didn't suffer too?""
 The room was silent.
 It felt like the curtain had lifted on a stage, and the spotlight was on her—Victoria's monologue.
 ""When you had that car accident, I was terrified, scared you'd really...""
 She choked, swallowing the word.
 ""Your mom found me and said none of this would've happened if I hadn't been around.
 ""Do you know how long that haunted me? You don't know anything! You even forgot about me!""
 Victoria yanked up her sleeve, exposing her wrist, mottled with scars.
 ""Why, Landon? When I was drowning in pain over our past, barely sleeping a few hours a night with a handful of sleeping pills, hurting myself to numb the guilt—And you? You started a brand new life and married someone else, as if nothing happened. Why?""
Chapter 6
 The spotlight snapped onto me, harsh and unyielding.
 I felt like an actor who'd forgotten her lines, standing there with a blank face, trying desperately to keep my composure, to look dignified.
 But Victoria wasn't finished.
 She pushed Landon aside and strode right up to me.
 ""What will it take for you to give Landy back to me?""
 ""Vicky, that's enough,"" Landon cut in, trying to shield her. His eyes were wary, as if expecting me to lash out.
 ""Are you really happy, clinging to a man who doesn't belong to you?""
 Victoria's question was sharp, her expression fierce.
 I felt strangely detached.
 As she leaned in, I caught a familiar, cool scent.
 Landon had always been obsessed with this fragrance.
 He'd even invested in a niche perfume brand just to commission this custom scent.
 On our first date, the perfume he'd given me was this exact blend.
 I'd always thought it was just a personal quirk.
 But in that moment, I realized—Victoria was the one who truly loved it.
 And Landon's sense of smell was more loyal than his memory.
 The subtle aroma curled into my nose, and the nausea I'd tried to suppress came surging back.
 Unable to hold it in, I gagged softly in front of Victoria. ""Sorry, could you step back? You're making me sick.""
 ""Coraline, did you really have to be so cruel?""
 Landon's reaction was even more dramatic than Victoria's.
 He glared at me, disappointment written all over his face.
 ""And you.""
 I covered my nose, twisting away from both of them.
 ""You should keep your distance too. You both reek of the same smell.""
 I exaggerated a wave of my hand, raising my voice for everyone to hear. ""You guys don't smell that?""
 No one answered.
 I stared straight at Landon. ""It smells disgusting.""
 His face turned pale, then flushed.
 After a long moment, he pressed his lips tight and muttered, ""It's late. Let me take you home.""
 ""No need,"" I refused. ""Let's settle everything right here.""
 ""Ms. Gunther, you asked what it would take for me to give Landon back to you—""
 I let out a soft laugh. ""Actually, I've already asked for a divorce. He said no.
 ""Do you really think your past with him means so much? That your love was so grand? Then why did he forget you, marry someone else, and refuse to leave me now?""
 Victoria's expression faltered.
 Seeing her discomfort, I felt a wave of satisfaction.
 ""And another thing, Ms. Gunther—
 ""Maybe you've been overseas too long, so you don't know. Someone who tries to break up a marriage while it's still intact? We call that a homewrecker.""
 The words hung in the air for a beat.
 Victoria's face went ghostly white.
 My words hit her like a sledgehammer, knocking the strength right out of her.
 She swayed, nearly collapsing.
 Landon caught her just in time, scooping her into his arms.
 ""Coraline, did you really have to be so vicious? Can't you see she's not well?""
 Victoria squeezed her eyes shut, a single tear landing perfectly in the hollow of his neck.
 Landon shuddered, torn between pity and anger—
 And all of it turned on me.
 ""Coraline, what right do you have to call her a homewrecker? If we're talking about who came first, you stole her place!""
 Regret flickered across his face, his hands trembling.
 I grabbed a water glass from the table and hurled it at Landon.
 He didn't dodge.
 Gasps echoed around the room as the glass struck his temple, water splashing down his face and soaking his hair.
 A dark red trickle of blood snaked down his forehead, mingling with the water.
 We stared at each other, both expressionless.
 No matter how many times I'd told myself not to care, not to be hurt, not to let it get to me—
 My throat still burned with bitterness.
 I blinked, forcing back tears, clutching my phone.
 I switched on the camera and hit record, looking Landon squarely in the eye.
 ""Go ahead, Landon. Say what you just said again.""
 ""What are you doing?""
 ""Oh, I'm just so moved by your grand love story. I want everyone to feel it—especially your parents.""
 Watching his face twist with panic, I smiled sweetly.
 ""Maybe, if they see how tragic you two are, they'll finally let you be together.""
Chapter 7
 Landon's face was ashen, his jaw clenched tight.
 His chest heaved with anger. ""Coraline, don't push it too far!""
 ""Too far?""
 I laughed until tears stung my eyes. ""And what exactly isn't too far, then?""
 ""You swore to me she was just the past, but now you're tangled up with her all over again—how is that not too far?
 ""I did nothing, yet your ex-girlfriend gets to humiliate and accuse me and throw mud at my name—and that's not too far?
 ""Why am I the only one who's gone too far?""
 Landon's eyes flickered, but he said nothing.
 Victoria trembled in his arms.
 Wilfred was the first to notice something was wrong.
 He shouted, panicked, ""Vicky looks like she's about to faint!""
 Landon's expression shifted instantly; he bent down to check.
 Victoria's eyes were shut, her breathing shallow.
 Without another thought, Landon scooped her up and rushed out, almost stumbling in his hurry.
 From beginning to end, he didn't spare me a single glance.
 He stayed with Victoria at the hospital all night.
 By the time he came home the next morning, I was just about to leave for work.
 A fresh bandage was plastered over the spot where the glass had hit his forehead, making him look a little ridiculous.
 He still carried the sharp scent of hospital disinfectant, mingled with a lingering trace of that cold perfume—a sickly, unsettling mix.
 As we brushed past each other in the hallway, he grabbed my wrist.
 Goosebumps prickled down my arm.
 I jerked my hand free, my voice nearly breaking. ""Let go of me!""
 The movement was so abrupt that Landon's hand scraped against the edge of the cabinet, leaving a faint red mark.
 He stood there, slow to react, before finally mumbling, ""Corrie, about last night—I'm sorry. Vicky, she...""
 ""I don't want to hear that name.""
 I pointed to a stack of papers on the kitchen island.
 ""The divorce papers. I've already signed them. If you're fine with it, let's go file as soon as we can.""
 Even if the divorce agreement had come a little late.
 Landon's eyes followed my gesture, but his face showed no relief.
 ""So you've wanted to divorce me all along?""
 What a ridiculous accusation.
 I straightened up. ""Did you forget what you said last night?""
 Honestly, when I heard those words, the only thought in my mind was, I will never agree to divorce him. I'd never give up being Mrs. Siebert so easily.
 I wanted Victoria to be forever branded as the homewrecker.
 I wanted to hurt Landon and let him hurt me too, until every feeling was burned away, until all that was left was mutual resentment.
 No matter how badly he and Victoria wanted to reunite, I would always be the wall between them.
 Until, by chance, I caught my own reflection in the living room's floor-to-ceiling window—a blurred, angry face twisted with bitterness.
 Suddenly, I snapped back to reality.
 Was I really willing to turn myself into a weapon of revenge?
 Sacrifice my own life for a man?
 Was it worth it?
 Landon's lips tightened. ""I didn't mean what I said last night.""
 ""If you didn't mean it, doesn't that just prove it's what you really think deep down?""
 ""I've never wanted to divorce you.""
 Landon's lips tightened into a thin line as he turned away, his voice rough and low, like it was dragged out of his chest.
 I walked past him. ""Well, from now on, maybe you should start thinking about it.""

We met at a shared job when we were both in other relationships, mine being an 8 year relationship that was slowly dwindling to an end. Over the time we worked there, we got closer as friends and supported each other through each other's break ups, getting coffee or lunch, or sometimes a drink after work. I won't lie I was attracted to Jake, but I knew we both had other things going on. I ended up needing to move out of the place I was in, and after telling Jake about my new search, he told me he has an open room in his apartment (shared with his brother) that he offered if I needed. To make a long story short, I ended up moving in with Jake and not long after we were basically together non stop. 

That being said, we have gotten into arguments a lot more than I am used to in relationships. Jake has unfortunately had a lot of terrible exes, many of his relationships involved cheating or abuse with him on the receiving end. But I am not trying to fall into the same patterns of our last relationships. Recently we got into a fight that made us both question if we moved to fast, if we potentially needed more time to heal or if maybe we are just fundementally different.

The situation is that one day I went to the store by myself. While walking around I was stopped and complimented by a guy, we will call him Paul. He noticed one of my accessories that is unique and was remarking about it. Next to him, was his (obvious to me) wife. They both seemed very nice, but Paul did seem a little more extroverted. After chatting about random things like the area and hiking, they asked me about what I do for work and learned that I have considered starting my own business. They seemed excited, saying that Paul's wife has her own business and they have a lot of connections and advice if I ever want to meet for coffee and try to take the business idea further. While this whole interaction did seem a little strange, as a woman I always have to have my guards up when it comes to strangers, I felt that if I let the fear of unknown stop me that I would be missing out on an opportunity. So I exchanged numbers with Paul and honestly felt excited. Once home, I told Jake about this interaction and he was instantly suspicious. He was worried that I was being scoped out for a relationship or hook up, when I assured him it was a couple, he said that he wouldnt be surprised because polyamory ""is popular in this area"". Its worth noting for context that at the time I met Jake I was sexually open in my current relationship as an effort to save things. So that comment frustrated me, it felt like he was trying to throw my past at me. When I tried to defend myself he called me niaeve. We ended the conversation in order to not get more upset.  

Later the next day Paul called me while I was sitting with Jake, I hadn't actually saved his number so I was a little thrown off that he was calling, but again assumed it was probably him trying to make a genuine connection. I politely asked how he was doing, and then apologized and ended the call saying I had something to do. I could tell Jake was visibly frustrated and thrown off, saying that this call confirmed something fishy was up.

At the end of the day he thinks that the whole situation, and me giving my number away, is disrespectful because I'm in a relationship. However I feel that is unfair as there should be more trust and not an assumption of sexual intentions. I wonder if I am blinded by having such a long term relationship where trust had been built for so long, or if he is blinded by his bad relationships. We have since broken up because I am so unsure about everything. Am I the asshole? ",0,1758397673.0,AITAH,8,0.33,False
1nm7oyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1nm7oyn/complete_burnout/,Complete burnout,"I am so fucking burned out. Especially dating feels like such a chore. Every day swiping endlessly on all the relevant apps. Getting almost no matches despite so much effort put in.

I cold approach women in public when I get the chance (doing it for about 3 years now). Also trying to form connections at the gym. But only rejection, rejection, rejection. Sometimes I think I had a good conversation and I got a number. Only to realize that she is ghosting me or that she gave me the wrong number.  Or she suddenly is ""not ready to date at the moment""  or she will just cancel the first date without any explanation.

And even if I get to a first date. Most of the time we realize that we have nothing in common and the date feels completely flat. Or I think it went really well, but she is either ghosting or sending the typical text that goes something like ""you are a really nice guy, but...."". And then I have to write an understanding reply to not make her feel bad.

I hate everything about this so much. It is the same every fucking time. Because people act the same when they are not interested. This is one thing I learned from all this. Always the fucking same bullshit. On repeat. Endlessly. The ghosting, the flaking the really really bad excuses all the time. They are sooo lazy it is almost insulting.

""Sorry, I did not answer for the last 10 (!!!) days. I was really busy with work/studying"",

""sorry, I forgot about an appointment today. I need to cancel our date.""

""Sorry, forgot I need to work today I need to cancel our date""

""Sorry, I a friend is not feeling well and I need to visit her now.""

""Sorry, I have a headache. Can not leave the house today""

""Sorry, my dog is not feeling well. I need to cancel""

""I would love to meet up and get coffee but I need to study soooo much right now""

And the thing is. You know every single one of those excuses is bullshit. Because if you react kindly and say: ""No, problem let us just meet another time. Whenever you are more comfortable"" or  something like this.  They almost always ghost afterwards. Or if they do not ghost they will write several weeks later something like:

""Heyyy,, I just wanted to be fair to you (lol). I meet somebody else. Wish you the best""

And I am reading a variation of this fucking bullshit message for the 1000th time and want to puke instantly. But I of course answer politely, because otherwise I am the bad guy.

I just feel so unwanted, so unlovable, so excluded. People always they ""oh just put yourself out there. You will see it is not that bad and you will get used to the rejection"". Whenever, I see somebody write this I just know they are either a women or a good looking guy. Because of course some rejection is normal and you need to deal with it as an adult. Everyone gets rejected in some cases. But it is always about the amount of rejection in relation to the positive experiences and the ""wins"".

I think I am not overly sensitive. I can take a few rejections. But this non stop stream of endless rejection, lazy lies and just plain disrespect makes me feel even more like I am some unlovable freak. I am so hurt by this huge pile of rejection and I am struggling so hard to find any positivity or hope to keep trying.

I know this rant is probably all over the place. But I need to get this out somewhere. Hope you are doing better than me. Because man I feel like shit.",3,1758397652.0,ForeverAlone,0,1.0,False
1nm7ngt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1nm7ngt/the_adhd_reality_check_that_changed_everything/,The ADHD reality check that changed everything for me,"For years, I tortured myself trying to follow neurotypical productivity advice. Wake up at 5 AM (my brain doesn't turn on until 10). Plan your whole week in advance (I can barely predict what I'll want for lunch). Focus for 8 straight hours (LOL).

I kept thinking I was lazy, undisciplined, or just fundamentally broken. Turns out, I was just using the wrong operating manual for my brain.

Here's what actually works when your brain runs on chaos and hyperfocus:

* Work WITH your dopamine, not against it. That boring task you've been avoiding for weeks should be paired with something that gives you a tiny hit of satisfaction. I do my taxes while listening to true crime podcasts. I clean while blasting music that makes me feel like the main character. Your brain needs the good chemicals to function stop trying to white-knuckle through everything.
* ""Task switching"" is a superpower, not a flaw. Neurotypical advice says focus on one thing until it's done. But sometimes my brain wants to do 15 minutes of writing, then organize my desk, then research random facts about penguins. That's not failure.
* Use hyperfocus strategically, don't fight it. When you feel that laser-focus kicking in, drop everything else if you can. Cancel plans. Order takeout. Ride the wave. I've written entire presentations, deep-cleaned my apartment, and learned new skills during spontaneous hyperfocus sessions. It's irregular, but it's powerful. I think this is called flow.
* External accountability > internal motivation. Body doubling changed my life. Having someone else around (even virtually) makes boring tasks 10x easier. I do my admin work on video calls with friends, book cleaning sessions with my roommate, and use ""focus with me"" YouTube videos. My brain behaves better when it thinks someone's watching.
* Make everything visible. Out of sight = out of mind for ADHD brains. I have whiteboards everywhere, sticky notes on my bathroom mirror, and my gym clothes laid out where I'll trip over them. If I can't see it, it doesn't exist in my brain.
* Perfectionism is the enemy of done. My ADHD brain loves to start 47 projects and finish none of them because they're not ""good enough"" yet. Now I practice ""good enough"" completion. Send the email with typos. Submit the decent work instead of waiting for it to be perfect. Done is better than perfect, especially when perfect never comes.
* Build systems around your actual patterns, not ideal ones. I meal prep on random Tuesday afternoons when I suddenly feel like cooking, not every Sunday like the Instagram influencers. I pay bills immediately when I think about them, not on a schedule. I work in coffee shops because my brain needs background noise, not silence.

What ""normal"" productivity advice have you had to throw out the window? And what weird system actually works for your ADHD brain? Mine was keeping a to do list so I won’t go spiral out of control.

I would love to see a form of Wi-Fi 7 that offers dual band connection into two different networks, and then allowing me to set up my DPN Wi-Fi network. It would use the power of both a 2.6 GHz and a 5.2 GHz network connection, and then whatever network I am on it would utilize the speed from both. 

So, I sit down at a coffee shop somewhere, and I see that they have both 2.6 GHz and a 5.2 GHz Wi-Fi options. I jump on my computer, connect my Deeper device, and login manually to both of those Wi-Fi options. Then, especially if I am hardwired into my Deeper device, it would utilize both of those Wi-Fi options from the coffee shop. It seems like this could potentially increase my speed dramatically.

Is this even possible? Is this something that is already a possibility with any other devices? Definitely not moving away from my Deeper devices anytime soon, as they are amazing, but this is what I would love to see at some point down the road.

I am 19F and found out my father was a few days away from turning 18 when I was born, while my mother was 39. He turned 18 and married her. Mother was wealthy, he was an immigrant from Russia. Came here with his mother and siblings and used to work at my mother's family house. I didn't know anything about him. My mother and my uncle, so her brother, painted a very bad image of him for me. Cheater, party guy, immature and not a good dad for me. At that point I had no idea about his age. At 15 I found him and was surprised how alike we are. Same blue eyes, light brown hair and we are both tall and slim. So I had that wow moment. I texted him on IG and after a long while he agreed to meet me but me being 1 5 I had to bring an adult with me. I had no one except mom. My uncles said he doesn't want to see that spoiled Russian brat ever again. That he wasted and threw around my mother's money and slept around.

I told dad I have to take my mother and he agreed.

Well she allowed us to talk in a coffee shop while she waited outside but he kept glacing at her and coulnd't focus. The reason of their divorce was that he cheated on her with a woman his age, when he was 23. Mom said he was a serial cheater but I cannot blame him in those conditions

He was distant and cold with me. Not mean, but he didn't know what to tell me and me being 15 I took it as a rejection and texted him a long text about how horrible he made me feel. His reply was short: You cannot understand but I can't do this.

Its been 4 years and he reached out. He wants to reconnect. I hesitated but accepted and we are going to meet tomorrow. This time without Mom, as I am an adult, I was also told and 3 people confirmed that my dad got drunk one night and banged her head's against the table. He admitted this to me but said he was in a terrible place. Added that he doesn't want to speak badly of her but he was very angry. She took his phone, isolated him from his family. His mother died and he had no idea.

I have many information I still need him to confirm but I asked him if he hated me when I was born and he left me on seen. Now I am scared",14,1758397530.0,TwoHotTakes,8,0.85,False

I’m a 47-year-old INFJ (nonbinary, 4M) in London, hoping to meet an ENTP (42–58) for a coffee or drink - locals only.

A bit about me... I'm an actor, artist, and writer, with therapy training (currently paused). I have pay-the-bills work on the side which is much less vocational. Formatting documents 😂🤷 I love badly dancing around my flat, cats, psychology, esoteric rabbit holes, and asking “but why?” about absolutely everything. My gender's complicated, but and fine with respectful curiosity if you’re nearby.

Both my ex's were ENTPs, I have some good ENTP friends and you guys are just the best!  
I love your wit, curiosity, and playfulness. If you can make me laugh and like talking about weird shit, we’ll get on well. Whatever happens - whether it’s just conversation, a new friend, or more - I’d love to connect.

1nm7idj,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1nm7idj/a_person_without_the_digital_world_how/,A person without the digital world – how?,"Hi,

like everyone, social networks are slowly destroying me — and not only them. I just need to turn on the screen and immediately there are a million things my brain forces me to do out of habit. As soon as I get up, phone in hand... turn on FB to see what's new... I should already get up but I check IG too... half an hour wasted. This happens to me throughout the day... I want to stop.

I understand how these algorithms work. I understand that they trigger all kinds of emotions in a person so they'll stay glued to them. I know that and I still do it, day after day, and yesterday before falling asleep I got a pretty nasty depressive hit from thinking that when I'm older I definitely won't want to remember spending ages glued to dopamine-eaters where I don't even remember what I saw five minutes ago — and I don't want to experience that anymore. I want to do hard things I used to do as a kid... I want to find an entry in an encyclopedia that interests me and read about it... I want to learn how to be bored again, just sit and look out the window. I want to be able to do routine things without needing a secondary activity that ""artificially rewards"" me for it. I want to be a normal person, at least for myself, and not be a slave to this crap anymore. I really feel like a heroin addict and I'm afraid of what will happen if I deviate from what's socially accepted (like alcohol, for example). I don't want to be constantly tired. I want to learn to think for longer periods again and, above all, for days to finally last 24 hours and not just feel like a timelapse.

I'll write this post, watch replies for a day or two, delete my account on all platforms and agonizingly wait a month until the deletion period expires so I'll at least be psychologically free... I did that with LoL and I haven't turned it on since.

Why am I writing this post? I want to know if you have experience with life without social networks and generally with cutting digital content out of your schedule? Right now I personally can't even calmly drink my coffee in the morning without having my phone in my hand and that's not normal, it's sick. What will this month be like, when it'll probably be the worst? How not to fall back into it, God forbid? At the moment I'm in a new environment and I want to incorporate that change into it. But I'm afraid, since there are a lot of new contacts in my life right now, how will they react when I tell them I won't have IG or FB anymore? Won't they think I'm some weird idiot? Can I realistically function only on a phone and SMS? Won't I cut off a large part of my contacts this way?

In the end, I want to quit this addiction but I want to quit systematically and progressively; I don't want to be that abstinent who for the rest of his life can't even light up because he's screwed. How do I cultivate the personality I had five years ago, when reels seemed like total bullshit to me? I don't want to torment myself for a month only to have some bullshit pop up online and fall back into the cycle I was getting out of.

How would you advise me to start and prepare for the change? I'll probably have to get rid of my social media accounts because it's always the same, I'll uninstall... I wake up one morning with 15 extra minutes and doomscroll again.

Please, when I make posts like this, I really read the replies and try to actually change things; it's not just that I'm depressed, don't know what to do with my life, I'm an idiot, pity me (I just want a pat). So I'd appreciate anything that helps me with the above. :) /translate this but don't change it or the content... into English.. but as a person not as AI",2,1758397225.0,selfimprovement,1,1.0,False

I asked him if he hated me because of it and I think I messed up,"I lost the access to my initial account and I wanted to post the update (but have to tell the whole story again)

I am 19F and found out my father was a few days away from turning 18 when I was born, while my mother was 39. He turned 18 and married her. Mother was wealthy, he was an immigrant from Russia. Came here with his mother and siblings and used to work at my mother's family house. I didn't know anything about him. My mother and my uncle, so her brother, painted a very bad image of him for me. Cheater, party guy, immature and not a good dad for me. At that point I had no idea about his age. At 15 I found him and was surprised how alike we are. Same blue eyes, light brown hair and we are both tall and slim. So I had that wow moment. I texted him on IG and after a long while he agreed to meet me but me being 1 5 I had to bring an adult with me. I had no one except mom. My uncles said he doesn't want to see that spoiled Russian brat ever again. That he wasted and threw around my mother's money and slept around.

I told dad I have to take my mother and he agreed.

Well she allowed us to talk in a coffee shop while she waited outside but he kept glacing at her and coulnd't focus. The reason of their divorce was that he cheated on her with a woman his age, when he was 23. Mom said he was a serial cheater but I cannot blame him in those conditions

He was  distant and cold with me. Not mean, but he didn't know what to tell me and me being 15 I took it as a rejection and texted him a long text about how horrible he made me feel. His reply was short: You cannot understand but I can't do this.

Its been 4 years and he reached out. He wants to reconnect. I hesitated but accepted and we are going to meet tomorrow. This time without Mom, as I am an adult, I was also told and 3 people confirmed that my dad got drunk one night and banged her head's against the table. He admitted this to me but said he was in a terrible place. Added that he doesn't want to speak badly of her but he was very angry. She took his phone, isolated him from his family. His mother died and he had no idea.

I have many information I still need him to confirm but I asked him if he hated me when I was born and he left me on seen. Now I am scared",2,1758396904.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,0.75,False

One thing I’ve been noticing (and loving) since spending more time here is how fast the events scene in Saudi is evolving.

It’s not just about putting on a show anymore, it’s about how the whole experience ties into branding, storytelling, and even the way people remember the moment afterwards.

That’s the space I’ve been working in recently, and it got me thinking: how do you see branding and events connecting here? Do you think most events nail the story behind them, or is there still a lot of room to grow?

Would be cool to hear perspectives, whether you’re in marketing, design, government, hospitality, or just curious. And if anyone’s up for grabbing a coffee in Riyadh to swap thoughts, even better.

1nm7bc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1nm7bc1/githroat_issues/,GI/Throat Issues,"So for about a year and a half I’ve been having issue with burps getting stuck in my throat and then I can’t eat or drink without it coming up until I get the gas out of my throat. Which can take hours on some occasions. I had an endoscopy late last year and nothing was found. 

I had been able to get it all mostly under control by discovering slippery elm which helped almost instantly with these flares up, and diet changes where I eliminated coffee and a few other foods I noticed were definitely triggering it. But about a week and a half ago I had an extremely stressful situation and about an hour or so after the bad stress had died down, I got a horrific stretch of burps stuck in my throat that I couldn’t clear out or eat without regurgitating until the next day. 

Ever since then it seems like I have extreme sensitivity to nearly every food that can be a GERD trigger and can’t eat my normal portion sizes without the burp and regurgitation issues. The slippery elm suddenly doesn’t seem to be doing much either. Despite the fact that I’ve also been following a pretty strict GERD type of diet to try to heal it the past week or so, and normally that would do the trick in a day or two with the few really bad flares with the issues in the past. I got on Tagamet a few days ago from my GI Dr and have a stool sample coming up. 

The medicine has made the burping and holding food down issue a bit better, but now I’m suddenly getting bad pain in my upper abdomen when I eat or even sometimes drink.   It almost feels like the intestines are twisted is the best way I can describe it and it’s better if I stand up. I do take a lot of supps daily including vitamin d, b2, magnesium glycinate, saw palmetto, coq10, and d mannose. And I recently started a digestive health probiotic pill. A lot are for various other health issues, but not sure if any of these would have triggered it. Does anyone have similar experience / suggestions for what helped them?

1nm7aww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Investors/comments/1nm7aww/seeking_angel_investor_brick_mortar_business_ks/,Seeking Angel Investor - brick & mortar business [KS],"TL;DR: Project Porch is a compact, pickup-first café/bakery with a built-in personal gifting line (ready-to-gift treats and curated bundles), plus professional gifting as an additional revenue stream. A lightweight mobile layer triggers “start order” shortly before arrival so items are ready when guests walk in. I’m seeking an angel partner for a single-unit launch in the Kansas City metro, targeting 2026.

What it is (high level): Small-footprint café/bakery focused on speed, quality, and consistency across coffee/espresso and a tight set of baked goods and confections. Personal gifting is a core revenue line for in-store and shipped orders; professional gifting is an add-on for local organizations and events. Tech approach is a major POS and loyalty provider with a light mobile front end. A proximity signal triggers prep a few minutes before arrival to balance freshness with throughput.

Why this works: A pickup-first footprint keeps labor and build-out lean. Gifting smooths seasonality and lifts average order value. Proximity-triggered prep tightens promise times without overcrowding the bar.

Status and traction (kept high level): Operating entity is formed. Playbooks and SOPs for bar, bakery, gifting, and fulfillment are drafted. Menu architecture and training modules are outlined. Local channels are identified for early personal gifting demand with optional professional orders.

Model snapshot: Average ticket targeted around $8–$10. Day-one operations are sized for a single store with fulfillment capacity. Year-one revenue target is mid-$300Ks with a path to $1M+ by year three through gifting growth and repeat ordering. Capital uses include build-out and permits, core equipment, working capital, and the mobile layer.

What I’m looking for: An angel investor comfortable with brick-and-mortar plus a light tech layer. Check size is flexible; structure can be a convertible note or simple equity (open to a SAFE if preferred). Value-add around openings, operations, or local community partnerships is a plus.

Key risks and plan: Labor and training risks are managed with a tight menu, cross-training, and rigorous SOPs. Throughput versus freshness is addressed by tuning the proximity window and throttling during peak times. COGS swings are managed through consolidated vendors and disciplined price reviews.

Ask to the sub: If you invest in first-unit retail with a tech-enabled edge, I’d appreciate a conversation. I also welcome feedback on an appropriate single-unit raise size and whether a convertible note or equity makes the most sense at this stage. DM for a brief overview deck and a high-level P&L; I’ll keep specifics off-thread.

Mods: If direct asks aren’t allowed, I’m happy to treat this as feedback-only. Please remove if out of scope.",1,1758396724.0,Investors,0,1.0,False
1nm7avw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nm7avw/watermelon_coferment_tastes_unpalatable_help/,Watermelon co-ferment tastes unpalatable (Help),"I got some coffees from hydrangea recently, including letty bermudez, which I loved so much that I ordered some more to let it rest for 3-4 weeks after roast and freeze it to brew occasionally or share with a friend at some point in the future. I also tried the honey jurutungo, which was okay but a bit underwhelming. I wasn't catching the notes but I think it just needs to rest some more and I'll tweak my recipe a little next time, so I am still hopeful. For context, everything I got was roasted on sept 7th. 

The last coffee I got was the [nectar citrullus watermelon co-ferment](https://hydrangea.coffee/products/caturra-bourbon-nectar-citrullus-washed-monteblanco), and I tried it after letting it rest for 2 weeks. I followed my usual recipe but grind was a bit coarser as I knew the flavor might be intense. The beans themselves and the grounds have a very unlikable smell, and the aroma was very indicative of the taste of the brewed coffee. God, I feel like the strong earthy watermelon flavor  clashes with the other compounds in the coffee and I just don't like it. Its terrible. I want to know if others had a similar experience with this coffee or if I just need to let it rest more and that it might taste good later on. If not, maybe I just don't like watermelon in coffee. This was my first co-ferment, so I was a little bit let-down, but I am still excited to try others (maybe watermelon is just too unconventional for my taste). For context, here is my usual recipe:

SCA water 

Coffee chronicler switch recipe (followed exactly, 93\*C)

4.5-5.2 on the ZP6 calibrated to burr lock at 0, cafec t90 filter

For this coffee, my grind was on the coarser end (5.2, I almost always love how most coffees turn out at 4.5), and my temp was lighter at 90\*C.

Additionally, I want to ask about how to approach which coffees to buy going forward. I usually drink washed or naturals from a local roaster, so this was my first time trying highly processed coffees from a high end roaster. I am very pleased with the other 2 and made more orders from hydrangea. However, I want more suggestions as to which US based roasters are good (Don't want to pay tariffs, though I am sad about not being able to get from EU roasters and rogue wave/September up in CA).  I hate boring coffees, so I am willing to pay some more for higher quality but don't want to waste my money on stuff I might not like and I still have to stay within my limits. Although I enjoy washed coffees, I have a new-found excitement to explore more processed and experimental coffees so I may ride that wave for some time, but I am open to trying more washed coffees that are still interesting.

What I really love about these smart kettles is how precise they are with temperature control. If you're into pour-over coffee or specific types of tea, you know different beverages need different temperatures for optimal taste. These app-controlled kettles nail it every time.

Here's what I've learned from using one:

- You can schedule heating times (perfect for morning routines)
- Most apps show real-time temperature readings
- Some even maintain your desired temperature for up to an hour
- You get notifications when your water's ready
- Many have preset options for different drinks

The convenience factor is huge, but there's also the safety aspect. These kettles typically come with auto-shutoff features and boil-dry protection. Plus, being able to check if you turned off the kettle from anywhere in your house is pretty reassuring.

If you're interested in upgrading your kitchen game, I'd definitely recommend checking out the options available here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. I've found the prices to be pretty reasonable considering the tech you're getting.

One thing to keep in mind is that you'll need decent WiFi coverage in your kitchen for these to work properly. Also, make sure to read the app reviews before buying - some are definitely better than others.

I've been using mine for about six months now, and honestly, I can't imagine going back to a regular kettle. It's one of those things you don't think you need until you have it, then you wonder how you lived without it.

Has anyone else tried these smart kettles? I'd love to hear about your experiences!",1,1758395723.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nm6vkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nm6vkc/aith_for_getting_frustrated_and_moody_during_my/,AITH for getting frustrated and moody during my family holiday?,"More of a vent than any real serious revelation.

My grandad 81, is part Irish and he used to come here frequently as a young lad so he’s been talking about coming back for years. My nan wouldn’t let him but after she passed he still wanted to go and visit his nans old place so we set a holiday up for him. My mum is disabled and in a mobility scooter (extremely limited walking) my mums friend is very mobile very fit (65) and my grandad 81 is slightly hunched over and has chronic back pain and arthritis, wheezy chest and gets tired quite easily. Understandable of course, for his age he actually doesn’t do bad at all for his years but he’s 81 nevertheless. I tried convincing him to rent a mobility scooter whilst here  multiple times and he just flat out refused saying he can manage. I explained that we’re away for 4 days this isn’t the usual pop out for coffee or two games of pool then go home it’s going to be a hell of a lot more travel plus carrying your baggage occasionally. He said the baggage is only a rucksack and he will be fine. I moaned at him to take his walking stick (that he never uses) and he took it. 


From the airport to the accommodation I carried my bag and his bag because it was obvious early on it would be a lot for him. He hasn’t used his stick once, he used my mums briefly but said he didn’t like it. The first night we went to a bar had food and my grandads back was killing so I ended up sorting us a taxi to get home. 

He didn’t sleep well, my mum woke up with a terrible cold and flu type illness. We all went off without her into town and I have to decide where were going, how were getting there, getting the scooter on and off. So I find the place, then a place for coffee, then a beer. My mum meets us later and then nobody can decide what they want to do or where they want to go so my grandad finds a place on his phone I look it up and get us there via bus and walking. After that nobody can decide again what to do, grandad mentioned one area he wanted to go and we get there and he’s really struggling and fed up cause he’s just done in. Nobody wants to stay out and do anything so by 6pm it’s time to go home. 

My mums friend has gone off out to the pub on his own, he’s a lovely man honestly one of the nicest loveliest blokes you could ever meet. Very generous very kind top man. Just can’t say honestly we have tons in common and us going out together alone all night just doesn’t really make any sense.

Mums gone bed, grandads gone bed and I’m just sitting here pretty bored. I know tomorrow will be another day of everyone looking to me to plan where we’re going and how we’re getting there. I get very overwhelmed and frustrated and my mum and her friend can sense it. I’m not being rude or anything and I know my grandad can’t help his age not my mum her physical condition or flu but it does feel like I’m more of a helper than a holiday goer. I get asked, does the bus stop here, can the taxi stop here, where will this be? Where will that be? And I’ve never been here before I honestly don’t know either I just search on my phone.

I’m in a bit of a mood but not nasty or anything but I’m helping everyone out as much as possible. My mum noticed this and told me to relax and she is grateful. I would help them till the end of time I always help my family. 

Part of me thinks lighten up I’ll look back at this in 10-20 years and regret being moody. But the other part of me feels justified for feeling how I feel. AITH?

1nm6v6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1nm6v6x/i_read_this_at_18_im_rereading_this_at_31/,I read this at 18. I'm rereading this at 31.,"""'The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to feel so relieved. When you get your heart broken for the first time, you can’t imagine loving someone else again or having someone else love you. You worry about your ex finding love before you do, you worry about being damaged goods. And then it happens. Someone else loves you and you can sleep well at night.

The second time you fall in love with someone, it’s going to feel different. The first time felt like a dream almost. You were untouched, untainted by anyone. You accepted love with wide open arms and desperation. “Love me, love me, love me!” So you did. And then it fell apart and left you shocked to the core. You realized that people could be cruel and break your heart. You realized that people could stop meaning the sweet things they said to you just yesterday. So when you go into it again, you’re going to keep in mind everything that you’ve learned. You’re going to say, “Love me, love me, love me…until you don’t. In which case, I would like some advance warning. Thanks!”

The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to compare it to your first love. That’s okay. That’s natural. You’re going to be studying the new love with judgement and wariness. “My ex never liked broccoli. Why the hell does this one eat so much broccoli?!” Discovering that you have the ability to love multiple people who are different and feel different is initially very jarring. Loving an unfamiliar body will leave you disoriented and in dire need of a map. That’s okay too. That’s to be expected. Just ask the new love for directions.

The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to suffer from a bout of amnesia. You’re going to poke and prod at your lover’s body and be like, “Wait, how do I do this again? How do I love you? I think it starts with us having a moment together in some coffee shop, right?” It’s going to feel scary at first. Falling in love is sort of like riding a bike though. You never really forget.

The second time you fall in love with someone, you’ll be a more sane person. Your first love is when you get all of your insanity out. You behave like an insane monster because your mind is freaking out about all these new powerful feelings. By the second time, however, you have an idea of what works and what doesn’t. It’s by no means perfect. The insanity will make a cameo at some point. “Peek a boo. I’m here! Hope you didn’t forget about me!” But you can usually shoo it away after awhile.

The second time you fall in love with someone, you will hopefully have better sex. Do not quote me on this.

The second time you fall in love with someone will still be exciting and you might even talk about moving in together or marriage. It will feel more “adult.” You have no idea what adult love actually is but you think it involves making coffee for each other in the morning and maybe even getting a dog. “This is my dog, Xan. I got him with the second person I fell in love with because that’s what you do! The first person I was in love with would’ve killed a dog.” The second time will not be the first time. The first time is an insane magical life gift that you can never reclaim. But that’s okay. The second time is more real anyway. The second time can involve some amazing love.'""

1nm6uh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1nm6uh6/i_think_i_channeled_my_spirit_guides_need_advice/,I think I channeled my spirit guides. Need advice.,"I receive messages from my spirit guides regularly through symbols, numbers, visual signs in meditation and in my dreams. 

Every time I meditate I always do a voice recording on my phone just in case I pick up on any spirit sounds, static or anything else. Then I journal about it. 

To give a quick background: I started my spiritual awakening in 2020 when both of my grandparents (who raised me) crossed over within weeks of each other due to COVID. Although, I’ve always been “different” since I was a child. Speaking to animals and being made fun of for it. So I never fit in with the crowd (thankfully 🤣). 

During this time though, I went into a depression as I had just moved back to the United States from living in Japan for 10 years then lost my grandparents right after. A couple months after I started therapy, I started to improve and my grandparents came to me and showed me my path (which is to empower others and contribute to elevating the consciousness of our earth through teaching and healing). So that’s what I do and I’m very connected and openly intuitive now. 

For the first time today after inviting spirit in during my meditation (which I always do), I channeled spirit through actual audio. They were speaking through me. My voice, their message. I wasn’t  controlling my words just speaking and some of the symptoms I felt were :

- Nausea
- Heavily grounded like the Universe was literally anchoring my body in place
- Safety and an unexplainable amount of love
- Forgetting the message when I came back to the “3D” 
- Food does not taste good to me 
- Water tastes like magic and candy 
- Awareness: I knew what was happening and conscious of everything. I was in two places at once. 
- Foggy brain and extra sensitive to energy when returning to my physical self. 

I’m a healthy woman, physically active, I complete various tests with my care provider regularly and am very healthy for my age group. So I know my experience was very much connected to higher consciousness.

My third eye was so open that I had to drink some coffee to come back down to my human experience. I’ve been in a state of some fog like I have one foot in the astral realm and the other in the density of Earth.

For anyone who channels, I’m curious to know what best practices you have to remain balanced after you channel (or any other advice you have). 

Before I “travel” to the astral realm I always do a protection type of prayer to my angels and visualization so I’m able to travel and return safely. After, I hydrate a lot. And typically it’s all good. This was a very different experience though.

Always open to feedback. I’m certain this is the beginning of a new journey for me. 

Thank you in advance and sending lots of love to all of you. ",1,1758395632.0,Mediums,2,1.0,False

I know the kind sheriff asked not to steal anything from the lighthouse, but I couldn't leave that note behind. The red phone seemed important, so I snatched that up too.

A full moon was more than a week away, so I hooked up the landline phone and tested it out. It made phone calls just fine, but the real test would be during the fog. The weather forecast was clear for the next few days, so I decided to head back to the library and do some research. Pouring over documents related to sunken ships in our area, I tried to pinpoint what capsized vessel the note was referencing.

Only two matches came back for the coastal waters around our town: a private fishing boat which sank a few years back and a large cargo vessel named the Butterscotch. Apparently, the Butterscotch drifted too close to a rock formation during a thick bout of fog and ripped open a hole on her aft starboard from the collision. Although a search and rescue party was dispatched, the Butterscotch was pronounced lost with all hands on January 3rd, 1959.

A footnote for the document highlighted one curious detail: the lighthouse wasn't operational during Butterscotch's final moments before the collision. Perhaps it would have saved the ship and all lives on board.

The weekend came and brought fog with it. When I woke up and saw the ominous clouds drifting outside my window, the first thing I tried to do was make a phone call on the red landline. I was greeted with an error tone, indicating no connection. Seconds after putting the phone back on the receiver, it rang.

“Hello?”

A few seconds of silence, followed by more unsettling mouth noises similar to the ones I picked up on the recording devices.

“Who is this, hello?”

“Light… guide our way with light…”

The connection abruptly ended, leaving me baffled. A loud knock on the door almost made me jump right out of my skin. Who would be outside knocking, when the fog was clearly covering the entire town?

Peering out of the kitchen window, I saw my father standing there. He looked at me with serious, intense eyes. I threw my hands up, shrugging to show my confusion. He pointed at the door.

“What are you doing, you're exposed out there!”

I didn't know if he could hear me yelling at first, but he responded by walking over to the window and shouting back:

“Just unlock the door, JJ! I'll come inside.”

Looking at the deadbolt, I frowned and reluctantly did as instructed. I made sure I was standing well away from the cold, fog infested air when he stepped inside.

“Dad, you seem… normal? Does the fog…”

Walking over and taking a seat at the kitchen table, he held a hand up and hummed.

“Listen, I shouldn't have told you to poke around that lighthouse. I was just drunk and saying things when you asked me about that phrase.”

“You're kinda ignoring my question, dad. Are you immune to the fog’s curse?”

Staring off through the window, he continued humming in a low, gravely tone. It reminded me of some old sea shanty that would play in the background of a kid's cartoon about pirates.

“If you were smart, JJ, you'd stop this investigation of yours. Stop trying to understand the fog. The voices.”

“Then why don't you just tell me, since you seem to be in the know! What happened to my mother, my little sister? You said she was dead, how do you know that?”

Before he could answer, the red landline phone started ringing. I walked over to answer it, but my father shot up from his chair and shouted:

“Boy if you know what's good for you, I wouldn't pick up that damn phone!”

Flipping the man off, I picked up the phone and pressed it to my ear without saying hello. More throaty mouth noises, more pleas for a guiding light and distant ocean waves came over the line. One small voice spoke in a brief second, sending goosebumps rippling across my body. The unmistakable sound of my sister… she sounded sad and lost:

“Where is the light, brother?”

“Aria? Is that you?”

The line went dead. Slamming the phone back down, I turned to face my father with fury boiling in my veins.

“Explain all this to me, you piece of shit!”

“I don't need to anymore, JJ. Now that you've answered that phone, you'll soon find out for yourself.”

He shook his head and stepped back outside, walking off into the shifting white veil. I spent the day waiting for the phone to ring again, but it never did.

<—————>

Fog lingered on through Sunday morning, intensifying my anxiety and growing cabin fever. Sitting down with a bowl of cereal for breakfast, I stared out into the shifting veil, wondering when I could get out and enjoy the sunlight. A faint outline slowly became visible as I stared out the window. Standing at the very edge of the veil, the face of a young woman smiled back with pale, soggy looking skin. Her eye sockets were pitch black voids. I blinked and the apparition was gone. Did I hallucinate?

Setting my used bowl into the sink, I noticed something unsettling about the tiny rectangular window framed above the kitchen counter. Two, maybe three distinct handprints were outlined in the glass. I tried wiping off the film with some wipes, but it became apparent the handprints were on the outside. Somewhat impossible, since my kitchen window overlooked a fenced off yard. I know for a fact nobody had been through that yard since I moved in.

Taking a seat on the couch, I turned on the TV and tried to pass the day away. My living room only has one window, which I keep covered with a blind since it faces a busy street. While watching old re-runs, I would occasionally look over and see a shadow moving across the blinds, as if someone ran by the window outside. Growing agitated, I got up and pulled the blinds open to get a better look. Nothing. I decided to just keep the damn blinds open while watching TV.

Nautical twilight came and shrouded the poor visibility outside in an inky darkness. Eager to just end the day, I made a hot chocolate and headed to bed, ready to unwind. I almost spilled my hot chocolate when a thundering fog horn sounded from somewhere outside. It was like a ship had parked on the street outside and began honking at traffic. I didn't even bother trying to look out of any windows, since the fog made it impossible to see a foot ahead. Instead, I took out my cellphone and dialed my upstairs neighbor, David.

“Hey, did you hear that?”

“Uh, no? Hear what, JJ?”

“It was a ship's fog horn, I dunno. Seemed pretty loud and impossible to miss. You're home, right?”

“Yeah? I'm just finishing up dinner?”

I apologized for bothering him and ended the call. Night crawled by, leaving me unable to sleep. I didn't hear any more noises, but I could swear the vague outline of hands would wave outside my bedroom window from time to time. Sunlight graced our town Monday morning, allowing me to go back to work and continue my investigation elsewhere.

<—————>

Following a hunch I had about the note mentioning faith, I paid our town church a visit. Last time I stepped foot in that little wood cottage style building, my dad was sober and our family seemed partially functional. The building itself hadn't changed at all, bringing me back to simpler days when I walked among rows of wooden pews facing an altar.

Pastor Mark looked a touch more gray and wrinkled than I remember, but welcomed me inside with his arms wide open.

“JJ, what brings you in here on a Monday afternoon? The next service isn't until Wednesday morning!”

“Well, if you aren't too busy, I had a question about the fog.”

He gestured for me to sit on the pew closest to the altar. Picking up a Bible from the lectern, he took a seat next to me and opened up the book.

“I'll only be able to answer in ways that pertain to religion, but go ahead, ask away.”

“I found an old note in the lighthouse, it mentions that faith can protect the mind. Do you have any idea what that could mean?”

Taking out my phone, I showed Mark a picture. He studied the words for a few seconds, rubbing his neatly kept beard.

“That's an interesting find there, JJ. I'll say this, the Bible has many verses about having faith in the Lord. Most famous examples include the devil tempting Jesus when he fasted for 40 days in the book of Matthew. Another well known passage is Psalm 23:4. Are you familiar with that one?”

Shifting in my seat, I thought back to my family church days, but couldn't recall anything meaningful.

“I guess it sounds familiar, but I can't exactly recall.”

Closing the Bible, Mark stood and placed it on the lectern.

“Well, I do recommend you read up on that one. Anyhow, I'll say this: faith isn't just about believing the Lord will protect you, it's about accepting his guidance and knowing how to avoid temptation. No amount of faith and praying for protection is going to keep you safe from our town’s fog, JJ. I know that because my brother was a God fearing man, and the fog took his sanity. Maybe the note means we should have faith in the Lord that the fog will pass when it comes.”

Staring down at the polished floorboards, I let the sinking feeling of disappointment resolve before allowing myself to speak. I couldn't fault the pastor for lacking in answers, since everyone else probably did as well. Except for maybe my father, but that man seemed pretty tight-lipped.

“Okay, thank you pastor Mark. I'll try to make an effort to stop by during church services on Sunday, it's just been hard after everything that's happened.”

Stepping down from the lectern, Mark walked over and placed a hand on my back. He looked down, closed his eyes and began praying for me and my family. After giving him a hug, I left the church to continue my investigation elsewhere.

<—————>

I was working a slow Friday shift when the fog came out of nowhere. Huffing at the thought of spending another night in those uncomfortable sleeping bags, I began closing up shop. That's when a stranger walked through our front door. He took a seat at the bar and ordered a coffee.

“Hey, do you know how to get back on the freeway from here? I got turned around in the fog.”

“Uh, yeah, just follow main street all the way down. I'd recommend getting a hotel for the night, though. It's awfully dangerous out there, what with the low visibility and all.”

He gave a dismissive wave and took a few nursing sips from his piping hot drink. Looking outside, I saw what must have been a dozen silhouettes standing in the fog outside. I could barely make out their features, but I swore they had soggy white skin and dark voids for eyes; just like the face I saw at my kitchen table.

“Hey, uh, do you know those people?”

I pointed to the door, but the moment I took my eye off the figures to watch the man turn in his seat, they vanished.

“What are you talking about?”

Regarding me with a perplexed scowl, he continued sipping his coffee and scrolling on his phone. I almost wanted to beg him to stay, just for company, but the man had places to be and went on his way.

Stepping into the bathroom, I washed my face and prepared to unwind for the night. Water suddenly surrounded me, flooding the entire bathroom up to the ceiling. Panicked, I searched for the door, only to fumble around in the dark. I couldn't hold my breath anymore, so I closed my eyes and faced the realization of drowning.

Gasping for air on the bathroom floor, I stood up and spun around the room. The flowing sink was the only hint water had ever been present. Still struggling to control my breath, I staggered over to the sink and took a long hard look at myself. I was totally dry. Placing a hand on my heart, I looked down and took a moment to steady my lungs.

Glancing back up at the mirror, I saw a boney hand with long, soggy white fingers draped over my shoulder. I shouted and spun around, but nothing was there. Running out of the bathroom, I locked the front doors and turned off the neon open sign. Hiding away in the back room, I called up my dad on my cell phone.

“Dad, can you come down to my work? I'm freaking the fuck out right now!”

“JJ, I told you not to answer the red phone, now you're dealing with the consequences. What do you want me to do about it?”

“Just come keep me company, please! I won't bother you with any questions, I promise!”

“Fine, be over in a bit.”

Sitting there in the backroom, minutes felt like hours. Gluing my eyes to the front door, I began cursing under my breath while waiting for my dad to show up. When his figure materialized in the veil, I almost thought the apparitions were coming back to torment me again.

Jogging over to unlock the door, I let my dad in and locked up behind him. Taking a seat at the bar, he threw his coat off and sighed.

“Got any booze in here, son? Fog won't be passing until tomorrow morning.”

“Uh, yeah, I'll open a tab for you.”

Fetching a beer from underneath the counter, I handed it over and watched my father begin a long night of drinking. An idea popped into my head when he took the first sip. Maybe I could get some answers out of him if he was drunk.

<—————>

Nightfall brought eerie silence to our store. My father sat with his head buried in his arms, about ten beers deep. Tapping on his shoulder, he reeled his head back and glared at me with glossy eyes.

“I know I promised I wouldn't bother you with questions, I'm just wondering… isn't there anything you'd like to… y’know, get off your chest?”

He shrugged and mumbled something incoherent. When I cocked my head to signal I didn't understand, he leaned back and rolled his eyes.

“So what, J man, if your grandpa couldn't do his,” he hiccuped and took another sip of beer. “His job right. Man never took a day off, could you blame him?”

“Dad, what the hell are you talking about?”

Raising an unsteady finger, he pointed and smiled. His eyes were rolling into the back of his head with every wobbling motion he made.

“Boy, full moon's tomorrow, so if he wants you to know, you'll know, by God!”

Watching him rocking around in his seat, I realized he was correct. The full moon would be tomorrow. Finishing off the beer, he passed out on the bar. Knowing I'd probably need to clean his bile off the floor tomorrow, I slipped into my sleeping bag and prayed for a peaceful night.

<—————>

Fog lingered into Saturday morning. Fortunately, my dad sobered up and left before my boss could find out. I was stuck inside for most of the day, since the fog didn't dissipate until late afternoon. When I got home, I crashed on the couch, exhausted from my ordeal.

When I flipped on the TV, my heart sank a little when the weather forecast predicted more fog to roll in at around midnight. Making a nice cup of hot chocolate, I ordered a pizza to be delivered and tried to forget about it.

Nautical twilight approached and one look at the ocean confirmed the weather channel's prediction. A wave of white sat in the distant horizon, waiting to be swept up by the oceanic breeze and inland into our poor little town.

A full moon rose from the sky, lending twilight’s end a subtle nocturnal glow. Waiting by the red phone, I knew something significant would happen when the fog crept in. Which it did right around midnight, snuffing out the moon's gentle light.

Shrill ringing from the phone made my heart skip a beat. I let it ring several times, wondering if I should let it be. With a trembling hand, I picked up the receiver and pressed it against my ear. It took a minute to comprehend what I heard. A voice spoke through washes of static, spouting out coordinates like someone talking over a radio channel.

“Station 149, we need some guidance here. Visibility is bad, very bad. We're coming from the west, heading 009 by 028, are you receiving?”

I thought about responding, but thought better of it when a series of strange mouth noises seemed to do that for me.

“I repeat, station 149, we are coming in from the west, heading 009 by 028, can you activate your beacon? We can't see anything through this fog.”

“I don't know what you mean, who is this?”

My question went unanswered as more strange mouth noises gargled over the line.

“Station 149, please activate your beacon! We're sailing blind out here, this is the Butterscotch! Oh God, watch out!”

A loud crashing noise echoed through the phone, followed by distant screaming and wailing alarms.

“Butterscotch on an open channel, we've collided with a land mass and we're taking on water, please send help! Station 149, are you there? Hello, hello?”

Staring out of my kitchen window, I listened with a heavy heart as the man screamed and pleaded for help. When his final moments came as icy waters rushed into the ship, I closed my eyes and leaned away from the phone as he let out one last blood curdling scream for help.",1,1758395596.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I know the kind sheriff asked not to steal anything from the lighthouse, but I couldn't leave that note behind. The red phone seemed important, so I snatched that up too.

A full moon was more than a week away, so I hooked up the landline phone and tested it out. It made phone calls just fine, but the real test would be during the fog. The weather forecast was clear for the next few days, so I decided to head back to the library and do some research. Pouring over documents related to sunken ships in our area, I tried to pinpoint what capsized vessel the note was referencing.

Only two matches came back for the coastal waters around our town: a private fishing boat which sank a few years back and a large cargo vessel named the Butterscotch. Apparently, the Butterscotch drifted too close to a rock formation during a thick bout of fog and ripped open a hole on her aft starboard from the collision. Although a search and rescue party was dispatched, the Butterscotch was pronounced lost with all hands on January 3rd, 1959.

A footnote for the document highlighted one curious detail: the lighthouse wasn't operational during Butterscotch's final moments before the collision. Perhaps it would have saved the ship and all lives on board.

The weekend came and brought fog with it. When I woke up and saw the ominous clouds drifting outside my window, the first thing I tried to do was make a phone call on the red landline. I was greeted with an error tone, indicating no connection. Seconds after putting the phone back on the receiver, it rang.

“Hello?”

A few seconds of silence, followed by more unsettling mouth noises similar to the ones I picked up on the recording devices.

“Who is this, hello?”

“Light… guide our way with light…”

The connection abruptly ended, leaving me baffled. A loud knock on the door almost made me jump right out of my skin. Who would be outside knocking, when the fog was clearly covering the entire town?

Peering out of the kitchen window, I saw my father standing there. He looked at me with serious, intense eyes. I threw my hands up, shrugging to show my confusion. He pointed at the door.

“What are you doing, you're exposed out there!”

I didn't know if he could hear me yelling at first, but he responded by walking over to the window and shouting back:

“Just unlock the door, JJ! I'll come inside.”

Looking at the deadbolt, I frowned and reluctantly did as instructed. I made sure I was standing well away from the cold, fog infested air when he stepped inside.

“Dad, you seem… normal? Does the fog…”

Walking over and taking a seat at the kitchen table, he held a hand up and hummed.

“Listen, I shouldn't have told you to poke around that lighthouse. I was just drunk and saying things when you asked me about that phrase.”

“You're kinda ignoring my question, dad. Are you immune to the fog’s curse?”

Staring off through the window, he continued humming in a low, gravely tone. It reminded me of some old sea shanty that would play in the background of a kid's cartoon about pirates.

“If you were smart, JJ, you'd stop this investigation of yours. Stop trying to understand the fog. The voices.”

“Then why don't you just tell me, since you seem to be in the know! What happened to my mother, my little sister? You said she was dead, how do you know that?”

Before he could answer, the red landline phone started ringing. I walked over to answer it, but my father shot up from his chair and shouted:

“Boy if you know what's good for you, I wouldn't pick up that damn phone!”

Flipping the man off, I picked up the phone and pressed it to my ear without saying hello. More throaty mouth noises, more pleas for a guiding light and distant ocean waves came over the line. One small voice spoke in a brief second, sending goosebumps rippling across my body. The unmistakable sound of my sister… she sounded sad and lost:

“Where is the light, brother?”

“Aria? Is that you?”

The line went dead. Slamming the phone back down, I turned to face my father with fury boiling in my veins.

“Explain all this to me, you piece of shit!”

“I don't need to anymore, JJ. Now that you've answered that phone, you'll soon find out for yourself.”

He shook his head and stepped back outside, walking off into the shifting white veil. I spent the day waiting for the phone to ring again, but it never did.

<—————>

Fog lingered on through Sunday morning, intensifying my anxiety and growing cabin fever. Sitting down with a bowl of cereal for breakfast, I stared out into the shifting veil, wondering when I could get out and enjoy the sunlight. A faint outline slowly became visible as I stared out the window. Standing at the very edge of the veil, the face of a young woman smiled back with pale, soggy looking skin. Her eye sockets were pitch black voids. I blinked and the apparition was gone. Did I hallucinate?

Setting my used bowl into the sink, I noticed something unsettling about the tiny rectangular window framed above the kitchen counter. Two, maybe three distinct handprints were outlined in the glass. I tried wiping off the film with some wipes, but it became apparent the handprints were on the outside. Somewhat impossible, since my kitchen window overlooked a fenced off yard. I know for a fact nobody had been through that yard since I moved in.

Taking a seat on the couch, I turned on the TV and tried to pass the day away. My living room only has one window, which I keep covered with a blind since it faces a busy street. While watching old re-runs, I would occasionally look over and see a shadow moving across the blinds, as if someone ran by the window outside. Growing agitated, I got up and pulled the blinds open to get a better look. Nothing. I decided to just keep the damn blinds open while watching TV.

Nautical twilight came and shrouded the poor visibility outside in an inky darkness. Eager to just end the day, I made a hot chocolate and headed to bed, ready to unwind. I almost spilled my hot chocolate when a thundering fog horn sounded from somewhere outside. It was like a ship had parked on the street outside and began honking at traffic. I didn't even bother trying to look out of any windows, since the fog made it impossible to see a foot ahead. Instead, I took out my cellphone and dialed my upstairs neighbor, David.

“Hey, did you hear that?”

“Uh, no? Hear what, JJ?”

“It was a ship's fog horn, I dunno. Seemed pretty loud and impossible to miss. You're home, right?”

“Yeah? I'm just finishing up dinner?”

I apologized for bothering him and ended the call. Night crawled by, leaving me unable to sleep. I didn't hear any more noises, but I could swear the vague outline of hands would wave outside my bedroom window from time to time. Sunlight graced our town Monday morning, allowing me to go back to work and continue my investigation elsewhere.

<—————>

Following a hunch I had about the note mentioning faith, I paid our town church a visit. Last time I stepped foot in that little wood cottage style building, my dad was sober and our family seemed partially functional. The building itself hadn't changed at all, bringing me back to simpler days when I walked among rows of wooden pews facing an altar.

Pastor Mark looked a touch more gray and wrinkled than I remember, but welcomed me inside with his arms wide open.

“JJ, what brings you in here on a Monday afternoon? The next service isn't until Wednesday morning!”

“Well, if you aren't too busy, I had a question about the fog.”

He gestured for me to sit on the pew closest to the altar. Picking up a Bible from the lectern, he took a seat next to me and opened up the book.

“I'll only be able to answer in ways that pertain to religion, but go ahead, ask away.”

“I found an old note in the lighthouse, it mentions that faith can protect the mind. Do you have any idea what that could mean?”

Taking out my phone, I showed Mark a picture. He studied the words for a few seconds, rubbing his neatly kept beard.

“That's an interesting find there, JJ. I'll say this, the Bible has many verses about having faith in the Lord. Most famous examples include the devil tempting Jesus when he fasted for 40 days in the book of Matthew. Another well known passage is Psalm 23:4. Are you familiar with that one?”

Shifting in my seat, I thought back to my family church days, but couldn't recall anything meaningful.

“I guess it sounds familiar, but I can't exactly recall.”

Closing the Bible, Mark stood and placed it on the lectern.

“Well, I do recommend you read up on that one. Anyhow, I'll say this: faith isn't just about believing the Lord will protect you, it's about accepting his guidance and knowing how to avoid temptation. No amount of faith and praying for protection is going to keep you safe from our town’s fog, JJ. I know that because my brother was a God fearing man, and the fog took his sanity. Maybe the note means we should have faith in the Lord that the fog will pass when it comes.”

Staring down at the polished floorboards, I let the sinking feeling of disappointment resolve before allowing myself to speak. I couldn't fault the pastor for lacking in answers, since everyone else probably did as well. Except for maybe my father, but that man seemed pretty tight-lipped.

“Okay, thank you pastor Mark. I'll try to make an effort to stop by during church services on Sunday, it's just been hard after everything that's happened.”

Stepping down from the lectern, Mark walked over and placed a hand on my back. He looked down, closed his eyes and began praying for me and my family. After giving him a hug, I left the church to continue my investigation elsewhere.

<—————>

I was working a slow Friday shift when the fog came out of nowhere. Huffing at the thought of spending another night in those uncomfortable sleeping bags, I began closing up shop. That's when a stranger walked through our front door. He took a seat at the bar and ordered a coffee.

“Hey, do you know how to get back on the freeway from here? I got turned around in the fog.”

“Uh, yeah, just follow main street all the way down. I'd recommend getting a hotel for the night, though. It's awfully dangerous out there, what with the low visibility and all.”

He gave a dismissive wave and took a few nursing sips from his piping hot drink. Looking outside, I saw what must have been a dozen silhouettes standing in the fog outside. I could barely make out their features, but I swore they had soggy white skin and dark voids for eyes; just like the face I saw at my kitchen table.

“Hey, uh, do you know those people?”

I pointed to the door, but the moment I took my eye off the figures to watch the man turn in his seat, they vanished.

“What are you talking about?”

Regarding me with a perplexed scowl, he continued sipping his coffee and scrolling on his phone. I almost wanted to beg him to stay, just for company, but the man had places to be and went on his way.

Stepping into the bathroom, I washed my face and prepared to unwind for the night. Water suddenly surrounded me, flooding the entire bathroom up to the ceiling. Panicked, I searched for the door, only to fumble around in the dark. I couldn't hold my breath anymore, so I closed my eyes and faced the realization of drowning.

Gasping for air on the bathroom floor, I stood up and spun around the room. The flowing sink was the only hint water had ever been present. Still struggling to control my breath, I staggered over to the sink and took a long hard look at myself. I was totally dry. Placing a hand on my heart, I looked down and took a moment to steady my lungs.

Glancing back up at the mirror, I saw a boney hand with long, soggy white fingers draped over my shoulder. I shouted and spun around, but nothing was there. Running out of the bathroom, I locked the front doors and turned off the neon open sign. Hiding away in the back room, I called up my dad on my cell phone.

“Dad, can you come down to my work? I'm freaking the fuck out right now!”

“JJ, I told you not to answer the red phone, now you're dealing with the consequences. What do you want me to do about it?”

“Just come keep me company, please! I won't bother you with any questions, I promise!”

“Fine, be over in a bit.”

Sitting there in the backroom, minutes felt like hours. Gluing my eyes to the front door, I began cursing under my breath while waiting for my dad to show up. When his figure materialized in the veil, I almost thought the apparitions were coming back to torment me again.

Jogging over to unlock the door, I let my dad in and locked up behind him. Taking a seat at the bar, he threw his coat off and sighed.

“Got any booze in here, son? Fog won't be passing until tomorrow morning.”

“Uh, yeah, I'll open a tab for you.”

Fetching a beer from underneath the counter, I handed it over and watched my father begin a long night of drinking. An idea popped into my head when he took the first sip. Maybe I could get some answers out of him if he was drunk.

<—————>

Nightfall brought eerie silence to our store. My father sat with his head buried in his arms, about ten beers deep. Tapping on his shoulder, he reeled his head back and glared at me with glossy eyes.

“I know I promised I wouldn't bother you with questions, I'm just wondering… isn't there anything you'd like to… y’know, get off your chest?”

He shrugged and mumbled something incoherent. When I cocked my head to signal I didn't understand, he leaned back and rolled his eyes.

“So what, J man, if your grandpa couldn't do his,” he hiccuped and took another sip of beer. “His job right. Man never took a day off, could you blame him?”

“Dad, what the hell are you talking about?”

Raising an unsteady finger, he pointed and smiled. His eyes were rolling into the back of his head with every wobbling motion he made.

“Boy, full moon's tomorrow, so if he wants you to know, you'll know, by God!”

Watching him rocking around in his seat, I realized he was correct. The full moon would be tomorrow. Finishing off the beer, he passed out on the bar. Knowing I'd probably need to clean his bile off the floor tomorrow, I slipped into my sleeping bag and prayed for a peaceful night.

<—————>

Fog lingered into Saturday morning. Fortunately, my dad sobered up and left before my boss could find out. I was stuck inside for most of the day, since the fog didn't dissipate until late afternoon. When I got home, I crashed on the couch, exhausted from my ordeal.

When I flipped on the TV, my heart sank a little when the weather forecast predicted more fog to roll in at around midnight. Making a nice cup of hot chocolate, I ordered a pizza to be delivered and tried to forget about it.

Nautical twilight approached and one look at the ocean confirmed the weather channel's prediction. A wave of white sat in the distant horizon, waiting to be swept up by the oceanic breeze and inland into our poor little town.

A full moon rose from the sky, lending twilight’s end a subtle nocturnal glow. Waiting by the red phone, I knew something significant would happen when the fog crept in. Which it did right around midnight, snuffing out the moon's gentle light.

Shrill ringing from the phone made my heart skip a beat. I let it ring several times, wondering if I should let it be. With a trembling hand, I picked up the receiver and pressed it against my ear. It took a minute to comprehend what I heard. A voice spoke through washes of static, spouting out coordinates like someone talking over a radio channel.

“Station 149, we need some guidance here. Visibility is bad, very bad. We're coming from the west, heading 009 by 028, are you receiving?”

I thought about responding, but thought better of it when a series of strange mouth noises seemed to do that for me.

“I repeat, station 149, we are coming in from the west, heading 009 by 028, can you activate your beacon? We can't see anything through this fog.”

“I don't know what you mean, who is this?”

My question went unanswered as more strange mouth noises gargled over the line.

“Station 149, please activate your beacon! We're sailing blind out here, this is the Butterscotch! Oh God, watch out!”

A loud crashing noise echoed through the phone, followed by distant screaming and wailing alarms.

“Butterscotch on an open channel, we've collided with a land mass and we're taking on water, please send help! Station 149, are you there? Hello, hello?”

Staring out of my kitchen window, I listened with a heavy heart as the man screamed and pleaded for help. When his final moments came as icy waters rushed into the ship, I closed my eyes and leaned away from the phone as he let out one last blood curdling scream for help.

Baldur’s Pit

A real time, single-dungeon, 12 hour DLC for BG2, Baldur’s Pit focuses on the arts of healing and revival. Selected companions from BG1 and BG2 get a full refresh, complete with new dialog, new voice acting, and new Companion Quests! The action in this game is absolutely relentless. This is not a casual game for casual gamers. 

Choose your Companions from  Branwen, Jaheira, Aeris, Viconia, Ajantis, Kivan, Minsc, Quayle, Tiax, Yeslick, Canderous, Osprey, Dorn, Corwin, Glint and M’Khin as you contend with a relentless onslaught of Quests, NPCs and Monsters, where a single misstep can bring tragedy. 

Baldur’s Pit introduces new concepts in the BG franchise: 

1. There is no traditional Rest - the entire DLC is flagged internally as an active battle zone for the entire game, so it is impossible to use the standard rest button to refresh your party.

2. To offset the lack of normal location- and time-based rest effects, new items, locations and NPCs can provide rest-like effects. These include Coffee, the Nurses Station, Restrooms, and Nurses. 

3. The Waiting Room is a completely new type of location: the elapsed time increment counter in the waiting room increments only one round of game time for every full turn of game play, highlighting the plight of the NPCs, Monsters, and Players who are in that location. 

4. Quick Saves happen automatically once every 20 minutes, and are accompanied by brand new cut scenes advertising in-game products and concepts, while new Chapters start every in-game hour! 

5. For players carrying Charnames through from past games, new Items are available to provide Abilities that are traditionally associated with Healing classes. These items include the Boots of Navigation, Bracers Of Speedy Healing, the Clipboard of Organization, multiple different Books Of Holistic Wellness, the Stethoscope Of Diagnosis, and the PPE of Unlimited Replacements. 

6. New romance options are also provided, with in-game cut scenes and different dialog options made available for successfully  navigating the intense and fast-paced romantic relationships. Only the most veteran romance players can achieve the “Tu auras un peu de mort! Et tu auras un peu de mort! Et tu auras un peu de mort!”

1nm6r57,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm6r57,Authentic Moroccan breakfast for under $12 - beach picnic edition,"I prepared this traditional Moroccan breakfast for a picnic on the beach yesterday. Total cost: $12 for 2-3 people.

We sat on traditional woven mats right on the sand with the Atlantic Ocean as our backdrop. There is something magical about enjoying fresh bread and coffee while listening to the waves of the sea—it is a common weekend tradition here in Morocco.

Cost breakdown:

\- Fresh Moroccan bread (bread): $2.50

\- Local red cheese: $2.00

\- Mixed olives: $1.50

\- Croissant: $2.00

\- Mssemen (Moroccan flatbread): $1.50

\- Amlou (traditional almond butter with argan oil): $1.50

\- Cashews: $1.00

\- Coffee and milk: $1.00

The bread and masmen alone are incredibly filling and last for hours. Amlou is a traditional Moroccan spread made from almonds, argan oil, natural olive oil, and honey—it's like a healthier, more flavorful peanut butter.

We spent hours enjoying our meal while watching surfers ride the waves on the horizon. The salty sea breeze makes everything taste better, and the traditional clay pots preserve the authenticity of the food. It was a wonderful day spent at a modest total cost.

This type of seaside meal is common here on weekend outings and costs a fraction of restaurant prices, while being more satisfying and memorable.",7,1758395411.0,budgetfood,1,0.77,False

Seems to be something that runs in my family - my mom has had a crazy amount of cavities, several crowns, and some extractions, same with my grandma. My theory is that it's got to do with pH levels but I don't know. I don't drink sugary drinks other that coffee, if I drink soda or anything like that I always get diet and sugar free versions. Dentists' advice is always ""well if you drink something other that water, drink it fast"" which isn't always realistic not pleasant. But my teeth are deteriorating. Got my first crown at 31, have another tooth that should get a crown before something happens to it. Welp. 

Came across online ads for ""remineralizing"" gum with xylitol (but I feel like most gum is sweetened with that) and hydroxyapatite. I'm not really a gum chewer but I'd give it a shot if it had any benefits and could actually strengthen enamel. It's kind of expensive though - would it be worth it or is it a gimmick?

1nm6iwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1nm6iwh/10_reasons_why_youre_so_tired_and_how_to_fix_them/,10 Reasons Why You’re So Tired (And How To Fix Them),"Can’t seem to shake that drowsy feeling, no matter how many cups of coffee you drink? Here are the reasons you might not be able to stop yawning...

If you’re feeling fatigued, not to worry. There are plenty of tweaks you can make to your routine to try and zap tiredness. From upping your water intake to topping up your magnesium levels, these are 10 reasons to tweak your habits in order to get a better night’s slumber.

# 1. You’re not drinking enough water

It might not be obvious, but not drinking enough water can affect the quality of your sleep. “If you’re dehydrated, you may have a reduction in levels of essential amino acids, which you need to produce melatonin – the sleep-inducing hormone,” explains sleep expert Lucy Shrimpton ([sleepnanny.co.uk](http://sleepnanny.co.uk/)). However, drink too much, and you’ll fall foul of the night-time toilet run, as Lucy explains: “We have a decreased need to urinate at night to allow us six to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep, but if you drink a lot of water close to bedtime, your sleep may be disturbed because of a need to use the bathroom.” The optimal amount? The NHS ([nhs.uk](http://nhs.uk/)) recommends drinking six to eight glasses of fluid a day. Water, lower-fat milk and sugar-free drinks, including tea and coffee, all count.

# 2. You’re stressed out

If you’ve ever spent a night tossing and turning, ruminating about conversations you’ve had during daylight hours, you’ll know that stress plays a big impact on your ability to drift off. “Stress comes with a release of the hormone cortisol, which is a little like having adrenaline running through your body,” says Lucy. “This can make it extremely difficult to settle to sleep. This hindrance to sleep can lead to more stress and so the cycle continues.” The solution? Find a method of getting your worries out.

# 3. You need to get moving

Not moving enough can also affect sleep. “Numerous studies have shown that regular exercise helps people to settle to sleep more easily and experience better quality of sleep through the night,” says Lucy. “Also, a lack of exercise can lead to weight gain which can cause other sleep related issues such as obstructive sleep apnoea.”

# 4. You’re spending too much time ‘switched on’

Avoiding digital media can go a long way to improving our sleep. “It’s widely known that using a screen within two hours of going to bed can cause sleep disturbance,” says Liz Cooper, nutritional advisor at Bio-Kult ([bio-kult.com](http://bio-kult.com/)). “This is because LED screens, found on televisions, computers, iPads and gaming consoles emit blue light, which can affect our circadian rhythm, a process that responds to light and dark and governs such things as our sleep-wake cycle.”

# 5. You’re not eating enough protein

What we eat can also affect how we sleep, but avoiding sugar and your daily latte may not go far enough. “Getting the balance right with protein is equally important,” says Liz. “Low protein intake is associated with poor quality sleep, while too much protein can contribute to difficulty maintaining sleep. Try to incorporate good quality protein sources such as fish, turkey, eggs, pumpkin and sesame seeds and chicken. These foods also contain tryptophan, which is needed to make melatonin. Other than increasing tryptophan, sufficient protein may support folate and vitamin B12. These compounds have a role in melatonin metabolism and balanced circadian rhythm.”

# 6. You haven’t got the right micronutrients

Studies have also found an association between poor sleep and micronutrient deficiency. “Insomnia has been linked to low selenium and calcium,” says Liz. “It has been shown zinc to help in regulating sleep; and research has also suggested that low consumption of certain B vitamins can negatively affect slumber. This is because of their role in the production and release of some neurotransmitters and hormones involved in sleep regulation, such as serotonin, a calming neurotransmitter which can also produce melatonin. In addition, B vitamins found in eggs, meat, poultry, fish, legumes and wholegrains, may help in the relief of restless leg syndrome, where a person’s limbs move involuntarily, a condition which is often worse at night, stopping a person getting to sleep or waking them up repeatedly.”

We were in charge of this shitty little part of ramadi, 1/9 guys know. Well I was put in an MRAP with the Ma Duce. No big deal so I started prepping everything prior to departure.  I had this system, my 5'11"" self would take the receiver up first. So I'd get it up on the hood, crawl up on the glass and then grab the receiver and mount it up in the turret.  

Well I got on the glass and stumbled, some how fell back, feet rolled off the reviever and ate shit right off the hood straight to the rocks and moon dust. Laying there for a second, just enough time to say FUCK ME the receiver rolled off the hood and nailed me right in the hip socket.   Holy shit, I quiet yelled lol. Like my mouth was open but sound wasn't happening.  I laid there in the dark rolling around hating life,  managed to get up and hobble some circles around the MRAP and tried again. Departed shortly after.

I finally got it all set up and let me tell you, standing up in that turret for hours, hip all screwd up..   bro no. I didn't walk right for a while after that. 

Said mission consisted of me yelling at people from the turret, security, or posted up in an IP station. It was fucking GAY lol. Brought plenty of those canned coffees/ rip its and grizzly long cut.

I have a passion for old slides, photographs of people that have long forgotten about and abandoned. As well as old art that tends to get lost in time such as old advertisements, holiday cards, wrapping paper. I would love to some kind of coffee table book for people to enjoy of my finds but I'm not sure where this would fall when it comes to copyright. I'm most curious about old family photographs/random vacation slides, where the original photographer has likely passed and I would also have no clue how anyone would be able to track down for permissions. The antique stores over flow with abandoned film photos and slides for .25 a piece and I just find something so incredibly charming and beautiful about them. 

Would something like publishing a coffee table book with these slides and photos be feasible or against the law? I just think it's so cool and so human to look at these things. ",1,1758394742.0,COPYRIGHT,0,1.0,False
1nm6g13,https://www.reddit.com/r/digestiveissues/comments/1nm6g13/possible_gerdadvice/,Possible GERD/advice,"So for about a year and a half I’ve been having issue with burps getting stuck in my throat and then I can’t eat or drink without it coming up until I get the gas out of my throat. Which can take hours on some occasions. I had an endoscopy late last year and nothing was found. 

I had been able to get it all mostly under control by discovering slippery elm which helped almost instantly with these flares up, and diet changes where I eliminated coffee and a few other foods I noticed were definitely triggering it. But about a week and a half ago I had an extremely stressful situation and about an hour or so after the bad stress had died down, I got a horrific stretch of burps stuck in my throat that I couldn’t clear out or eat without regurgitating until the next day. 

Ever since then it seems like I have extreme sensitivity to nearly every food that can be a GERD trigger and can’t eat my normal portion sizes without the burp and regurgitation issues. The slippery elm suddenly doesn’t seem to be doing much either. Despite the fact that I’ve also been following a pretty strict GERD type of diet to try to heal it the past week or so, and normally that would do the trick in a day or two with the few really bad flares with the issues in the past. I got on Tagamet a few days ago from my GI Dr and have a stool sample coming up. 

The medicine has made the burping and holding food down issue a bit better, but now I’m suddenly getting bad pain in my upper abdomen when I eat or even sometimes drink.  It almost feels like the intestines are twisted is the best way I can describe it and it’s better if I stand up. Does anyone have similar GERD experience or ideas of what might be wrong/ suggestions for what could help? 

I do take a lot of supps daily including vitamin d, b2, magnesium glycinate, saw palmetto, coq10, and d mannose. And I recently started a digestive health probiotic pill. A lot are for various other health issues, but not sure if any of these would have triggered it? ",1,1758394682.0,digestiveissues,1,1.0,False

Dillema I have is that she was touchy with me in the past but I do not want to escalate too fast in case she is just friendly. 

When it comes to texting after work I noticed that she immediately reads my messages and then replies quite late. Could be a sign of her not being interested or could it be that she reads my message and then hides it so her husband does not see them. I say this because once I sent her a long message and next day she said ""please no more longer messages, my husband was home"", that night she replied very late saying she was busy etc. etc.

  
I know I will be told off by posting here, and people will tell me that if she wanted to she would give me signs. However he is her only partner, she never dated, I am sure she does not know ""the game"" as it is. She used to tell me as well that they dont sleep in the same bedroom.

A shining beacon of progress and civility! A metropolis where the citizens can walk the streets without a care in the world, knowing they are safe, sound, and secure. But for some, too much safety, too much soundness, and an overabundance of security can be… well, a little boring!

The Utonium residence, a colorful splash of mid-century modern architecture nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac, was experiencing a profound and unusual quiet. Inside, slumped on the living room floor, was Buttercup, the toughest fighter of the Powerpuff Girls. Her brow was furrowed into a permanent scowl, her arms crossed so tightly they looked like a pretzel, and a low, rumbling growl emanated from her chest.

For three solid weeks, not a single monster had attacked Townsville. No giant amoebas, no bank-robbing gangsters, no cross-dressing devils. The Mayor’s emergency hotline had been silent. Mojo Jojo hadn’t so much as plotted an evil scheme. The city was peaceful. Blissfully, agonizingly peaceful.

""Buttercup, sweetie,"" said Professor Utonium, kneeling beside her with a plate of freshly baked cookies. ""I made your favorite! Double-fudge destruction chunks!""

Buttercup glanced at the cookie, then back at the wall. ""Not hungry.""

Bubbles floated down, clutching Octi, her beloved stuffed octopus. ""Wanna play dress-up, Buttercup? We can be space princesses fighting evil moon slugs!"" She made a little ‘pew pew’ sound.

""Lame,"" Buttercup grumbled.

Blossom descended, a large, leather-bound book in her hands. ""Perhaps some intellectual stimulation? I've found a fascinating treatise on advanced quantum mechanics. It posits that multiple timelines could—""

""BOR-ING!"" Buttercup shouted, the force of her voice rattling the windows. She stood up and began pacing like a caged tiger. ""What's the point of having super strength if there's nothing to punch?! I need to punch something! I need to smash! I need to feel the satisfying crunch of a monster’s jaw under my fist!""

The Professor sighed, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Blossom and Bubbles exchanged worried glances. They had tried everything: games, movies, even a trip to the malodorous Townsville Dump so Buttercup could smash old refrigerators. Nothing worked. Her grumpiness was a thick, green fog that had settled over the entire house.

Later that evening, as the girls were upstairs (Buttercup was likely punching her pillow into oblivion), the Professor sat in his armchair, sipping lukewarm coffee and perusing the Townsville Chronicle. He scanned past headlines about bake sales and lost cats, his eyes glazing over with worry. Then, a small, peculiar ad in the classifieds caught his attention.

It was starkly minimalist. Just a simple, black-and-white drawing of a smiling face, almost childlike in its design. Beneath it, a single, confident tagline: “Smiling Friends. Guaranteed to make you smile.”

A phone number was listed below. The Professor stared at it. It seemed… unconventional. But at this point, he was desperate. He picked up the large, red telephone on the end table and carefully dialed the number.

The next morning, two figures stood on the Utonium’s manicured lawn. The first was Pim, a short, pink, vaguely humanoid creature with a single antenna-like strand of hair sticking up from his head. He was practically vibrating with positive energy, his wide eyes taking in the vibrant colors of the house.

""Oh, golly, Charlie, look at this place!"" Pim chirped. ""It's so whimsical! I have a really good feeling about this one. I can just feel the potential for smiles radiating from the very foundation!""

Beside him stood Charlie, a taller, yellow creature with a long, drooping nose and a perpetually tired expression. He took a drag from an imaginary cigarette. ""Yeah, it's a real trip, Pim. Looks like a-a-a… like a cartoon threw up, you know? Like one of those old, uh… one of those old shows my grandma used to watch. I'm just sayin', it's a lot. My eyes are kinda hurtin'.""

Pim adjusted his tiny, non-existent lapels. ""Well, let's stay positive! A client in need is a friend indeed! Let's go make a new friend!""

Pim marched confidently to the door and pressed the doorbell, which chimed a cheerful little tune. Charlie shuffled behind him, hands stuffed in his pockets.

The door swung open to reveal Professor Utonium, beaming with academic warmth. ""Ah, you must be the Smiling Friends! Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Professor Utonium.""

""A pleasure to meet you too, sir!"" Pim said, extending a hand for a vigorous shake. ""My name's Pim, and this is my partner, Charlie! We're here to turn that frown upside down!""

""Uh, yeah, hey,"" Charlie mumbled, giving a slight nod. ""Nice, uh… nice house. It's got that whole… Jetsons-but-on-the-ground kinda thing goin' on. It's… it's a choice.""

""Why, thank you!"" the Professor said, either missing or ignoring the backhanded compliment. ""Please, do come in.""

He led them into the living room, gesturing for them to take a seat on the plush, circular sofa. ""I hope you can help. It's my daughter, Buttercup. She's one of my three girls, and she's been in a terrible funk lately. Nothing seems to cheer her up. I must warn you, she can be a little… complicated.""

""No client is too complicated for the Smiling Friends!"" Pim declared, puffing out his chest. ""We’ve dealt with everything from closet-dwelling ghouls to, you know, that guy who wanted to end his favorite TV show. We can handle it!""

""Right, right,"" Charlie added, sinking into the couch cushions. ""Just, uh… just so we're clear, she's not gonna, like, throw us through a wall or anything, right? 'Cause the insurance for that is a whole… it’s a whole thing.""

""Oh, heavens no!"" the Professor chuckled. ""She's just a little girl!"" He then turned to the base of the stairs. ""Girls! Could you come down here, please? We have company!""

Three streaks of light—pink, blue, and green—shot down the stairs and hovered in the air. Blossom and Bubbles wore polite, curious expressions. Buttercup looked like she had just swallowed a lemon.

""Girls, these are Mr. Pim and Mr. Charlie,"" the Professor announced. ""They're the Smiling Friends, and they're going to help Buttercup feel happy again!""

Buttercup’s eyes narrowed. ""I don't need help,"" she growled. ""I'm not a baby.""

""Nonsense, dear,"" the Professor said reassuringly. ""I'm certain you'll be smiling by the end of the day!""

""We'll help too!"" Bubbles chirped.

""It will be a fun experiment in emotional recalibration,"" Blossom added with a nod.

Pim floated slightly on the balls of his feet, his enthusiasm infectious to everyone but its intended target. ""That's the spirit! Don't you worry, little lady! Pim is on the case, and my smile-o-meter has never failed me!""

Charlie looked from the flying, super-powered child to Pim and back again. He sighed softly. ""Uh, yeah,"" he said, pointing a thumb at Pim. ""What he said.""

Buttercup shot them a glare that could curdle milk. ""Fine,"" she spat. ""But this is gonna be stupid."" She reluctantly lowered herself to the floor, still floating an inch off the ground out of sheer defiance.

The Narrator chimes in: Ah, the first step to happiness! A fun-filled day of activities! Surely this will do the trick!

Their first stop was the Professor's attic. Pim had suggested they seek out happy memories among old belongings. The attic was a dusty, cluttered treasure trove of scientific gizmos and forgotten family heirlooms.

""Ooh, look!"" Bubbles squealed, holding up a faded photograph of the girls as toddlers, covered in finger paint. ""Remember this?""

""I remember I got more paint on Blossom than on the paper,"" Buttercup said, a flicker of something almost-not-miserable in her eyes before it was extinguished. ""Whatever.""

Pim rummaged through a box. ""How about this, Buttercup? Your first training helmet! Think of all the heroic thoughts you had while wearing this!""

Buttercup just grunted and kicked at a pile of discarded blueprints. ""It's all useless junk.""

Charlie, meanwhile, was idly poking at a box of old toys. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He pulled it out. It was a small, die-cast toy sports car, a sleek silver model with red racing stripes. He stared at it, his usual mask of ironic detachment slipping for a moment.

""Whoa,"" he said, his voice quiet. ""My… my uncle had one of these. The exact model. I remember he, uh… he never let me play with it. Said it was a collector's item."" He turned the little car over in his hand. ""He was a real piece of work, that guy. Kinda reminded me of Mr. Frog, actually. Just, like, always screamin' about something, you know?"" He pocketed the car and shrugged. ""Anyway. What's next on the, uh… on the fun-list?""

Next was a picnic in Townsville Park. Pim had laid out a perfect checkered blanket and was now pointing at the sky. ""Look, Buttercup! That cloud looks just like a smiling puppy! And that one over there looks like a happy little ice cream cone!""

Buttercup lay on her back, arms behind her head, staring blankly at the sky. ""It's water vapor, you weirdo. They look like clouds.""

Their day continued at Townsville's theme park, ""Thrill-a-delphia."" Pim insisted they ride the tallest, fastest rollercoaster, ""The Vomit Comet."" As they rocketed through loops and corkscrews, Pim shrieked with unadulterated joy, Bubbles giggled uncontrollably, and Blossom calculated the G-forces with intense concentration. Buttercup remained stoic, her expression unchanged, as if she were merely sitting on a park bench. Charlie, meanwhile, was pale green, his eyes squeezed shut, gripping the safety bar so hard his knuckles were white.

After the park, Pim suggested a calming yoga session. He wobbled precariously in a tree pose, sweat beading on his pink forehead as he chanted, ""I am… a happy… willow tree… bending with the winds… of joy… whoa!"" before tipping over. Buttercup executed a perfect, one-handed handstand with a look of utter contempt. Charlie had spread his mat out, lay down for the Savasana pose, and was now fast asleep, a soft, wheezing snore escaping his long nose.

Finally, as the sun began to set, they went to see a movie. Pim had chosen an animated feature called ""Barnaby Bear's Big Hug."" It was an hour and a half of saccharine songs and cloying morals. As the credits rolled and they filed out of the theater, Pim was wiping a tear from his eye.

""Wow!"" he exclaimed, his voice thick with emotion. ""That was just… that was awesome! When Barnaby shared his honey with the grumpy badger? Gosh, that just… that really got me.""

""Dude, will you calm down?"" Charlie said, rubbing his eyes. ""It was a kids' movie, Pim. The badger had no motivation. I didn't really like it that much, to be honest. The animation was kinda cheap.""

""I loved it!"" Bubbles sang, clutching a plush Barnaby Bear she'd gotten at the concession stand. ""The songs were so happy!""

Blossom turned to her green-clad sister. ""So, Buttercup? What did you think of today? Did you have any fun at all?""

It was the wrong question.

Buttercup stopped walking. She spun around, her face a thunderous mask of pure rage. ""Fun?"" she screamed, her voice echoing through the theater lobby. ""FUN?! The whole day was STUPID! Looking at junk was stupid! The clouds were stupid! The rollercoaster was okay, I guess, but your screaming was stupid! The bendy-stretchy stuff was stupid! And that movie… that movie was the STUPIDEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! NOTHING WORKED! I'M STILL NOT HAPPY! I just want to PUNCH something!""

A silence fell over the group. Passersby gave them a wide berth. Pim’s cheerful facade finally cracked. His shoulders slumped, his antenna drooped, and his wide eyes looked watery. ""But… but my smile-o-meter… it's never wrong…""

Charlie put a hand on his partner's shoulder, a look of pity mixed with relief on his face. ""Hey, it's alright, man. We gave it a shot. She's a tough case."" He turned to the girls. ""Look, uh… no offense, but I kinda think we're, we’re startin' to get on her bad side here. We should probably just call it a day."" He looked at Pim. ""We gotta go back to the office anyway. She's gotta fill out the, uh… the failure-to-smile paperwork.""

The Narrator chimes in: Oh dear! It seems our plucky little heroes from another company have failed! Whatever will they do now? A trip back to the office seems like a rather dull end to the day!

As the Narrator's voice faded, Charlie’s head tilted slightly. He glanced up at the ceiling of the lobby, a confused look on his face, as if he'd heard a fly buzzing near his ear. He didn't say anything, just shook his head and gestured for the girls to follow.

The Smiling Friends office was a small, unassuming building wedged between a pawn shop and a laundromat. As the five of them approached, the street was quiet.

""Okay, so it's just a, it's just a few forms,"" Charlie was explaining. ""Standard stuff. Section A is 'Reason for Unhappiness,' Section B is 'Activities Attempted,' and then there's a little box you can check if you, uh… if you feel we made things worse.""

Suddenly, the ground began to shake. A deafening roar split the air. From behind a skyscraper, a colossal creature emerged. It was a grotesque beast made of living garbage and scrap metal, with glowing red tires for eyes and a massive, rusty dumpster for a mouth. It bellowed again, sending cars flying.

The monster’s enormous, trash-strewn foot slammed down right in front of the Smiling Friends office. The facade of the building crumpled inwards with a sickening crunch of brick and glass.

Inside, at his desk, Alan was meticulously polishing a block of cheese, his headphones blasting heavy metal. The wall behind him imploded. He didn't flinch. Glep, a small, green creature, was sitting across from him, tapping away on his iPad. A chunk of ceiling landed on Glep’s desk. He didn't look up.

Alan finally took off his headphones. The sound of screaming and destruction faintly filtered in. ""Hey, Glep,"" he said calmly. ""Did you hear a noise?""

Glep looked up from his iPad for a fraction of a second and made a small, indifferent sound: ""Meh.""

Alan shrugged. ""Huh. Must've been a bird."" He put his headphones back on and returned to his cheese.

Outside, chaos reigned. People were screaming and running in every direction. The monster’s gaze fell upon the small group standing on the sidewalk. With a swift, clumsy motion, a giant claw made of rebar and old bicycle frames swooped down and snatched Charlie and Pim off the ground.

""WHOA! HEY!"" Charlie yelled, dangling a hundred feet in the air.

""AHHHH! CHARLIE! IT'S GOT US!"" Pim shrieked, his little legs flailing wildly.

The monster brought them towards its gaping, foul-smelling maw. In that moment, staring into the abyss of rotting food and rusted metal, Charlie went pale. ""Oh my god, Pim! Oh my god, this is it! We're gonna die! I'm gonna puke! I'm definitely gonna puke!""

But down on the street, something had changed. Blossom and Bubbles were ready to leap into action, but they stopped and stared at their sister.

Buttercup was looking up at the monster, at the pure, unadulterated chaos, at the imminent danger. And for the first time all day, a slow, wide, predatory grin spread across her face.

""Now this,"" she said, her voice filled with a terrifying glee, ""is what I'm talking about.""

She shot into the air like a green cannonball.

What followed was a beautiful, brutal ballet of destruction. Buttercup became a blur of motion, a verdant comet of fury. She delivered a lightning-fast series of punches to the monster's metallic gut, each impact echoing like a thunderclap. WHAM! BAM! POW! She flew up and grabbed its two antennae—a pair of bent streetlights—and tied them into a pretzel. The monster roared in pain and frustration, dropping a terrified Pim and Charlie.

Blossom swooped in, catching them with a pink energy field just before they hit the pavement.

Buttercup wasn't done. She zipped around the beast, dismantling it piece by piece, throwing tires into orbit and ripping off chunks of its garbage hide. For the grand finale, she flew straight up into the clouds, then came down in a power-dive, her fist glowing with green energy. She struck the monster square in the head with a punch that shook the entire city block. The colossal garbage beast teetered, its tire-eyes spinning, before it collapsed into a massive, stinking heap of junk, utterly defeated.

Buttercup landed softly amidst the wreckage, dusting off her hands. She was breathing heavily, her hair was a mess, and she was covered in grime. But she was radiating pure, unadulterated joy. She was finally, truly happy.

""Woo-hoo! Buttercup!"" Bubbles cheered, flying over with Blossom.

""Excellent work, sister!"" Blossom said with a proud smile. ""The Professor is going to be so happy you're feeling better!""

Pim and Charlie staggered to their feet, brushing themselves off. Pim rushed over to Buttercup. ""Wow! That was amazing! Thank you so much for saving us!""

Charlie stumbled after him, still looking green. ""Yeah, man… thanks. I… I genuinely thought I was gonna die. My whole life flashed before my eyes. It was mostly just me watching TV. It was really underwhelming, actually."" He took a deep breath. ""So… wait a minute.""

A strange, awkward energy settled over the group as the adrenaline faded.

""It seems,"" Charlie began, looking at Pim, ""that, uh… you know. It seems like we didn't really… do anything. To, uh… to make her smile.""

Pim’s brow furrowed in serious thought, his cartoony demeanor replaced by a look of genuine professional concern. ""Yeah, no, you're right, Charlie. Technically, the monster made her smile. A… a third party was the primary catalyst for the smile-event. So, does that… does that count as a success for us? Or…""

""I don't know, man,"" Charlie said, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Because, like, we were there. You know? Our presence led to this whole situation. If we hadn't been there, maybe the monster wouldn't have… well, no, the monster probably still would have shown up. But it grabbed us. So…""

""So, by being in mortal danger,"" Pim continued, talking over him, ""we inadvertently created the stimulus required for the client's emotional upturn. So, do we still have to do the paperwork? The failure paperwork? Because this feels more like a… like a circumstantial success.""

""Yeah, a circumstantial success, I like that,"" Charlie nodded. ""But does that mean we get paid? 'Cause the boss is real specific about the whole 'we have to be the ones who make them smile' clause. It's like, right there in the handbook. Page four, I think. Under 'No Proxies'.""

""But this is a grey area, Charlie! It's a total grey area!"" Pim insisted, his voice getting more serious. ""We need to consider the—""

The three girls had been watching this exchange in complete, baffled silence. Blossom and Bubbles just looked at each other, their heads tilted.

Finally, Buttercup had had enough. ""OH, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD!"" she bellowed, her good mood already starting to fray. ""SHUT UP!""

Blossom gave a nervous chuckle. ""Right! Well, we should probably be going now! Before… uh… before she turns grumpy again."" She grabbed Buttercup's arm.

""It was nice meeting you!"" Bubbles called as she and Blossom pulled a still-grinning Buttercup into the air. ""Bye, Smiling Friends!""

Pim and Charlie watched them fly away into the evening sky. Then, their gaze fell upon the smoldering, gaping hole that used to be the front of their office.

""I don't think the Boss is gonna be happy about this, Pim, he's definitely gonna dock our pay for this."" Charlie said with a heavy sigh.

The Narrator chimes in: It looks like the Smiling Friends won't be smiling when they see that repair bill! Hahaha!

Charlie looked up at the sky again, his expression calm but firm. ""Hey. No offense, man,"" he said to the empty air. ""But you've kinda been getting on my nerves all day.""

The Narrator's voice, suddenly flustered: Oh! Uh… my apologies. I didn't realize…

""Yeah, no worries, man,"" Charlie said, waving a dismissive hand.

A moment of silence passed.

The Narrator, regaining his composure: AND SO ONCE AGAIN, THE DAY IS SAVED! THANKS TO… THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!

**Basics**  
I am 27, brown eyes and brown hair that I generally keep short. On the bigger side but working on slimming down, and very active. I am currently doing my PhD while working in academia, and on my limited free time I like trekking/hiking and photography, usually while hanging out with my dog. I live in southeastern Europe, and I'd prefer to eventually close the distance with my PersonTM one way or another. I love nature, pop music and just chilling with some coffee and small talk (or a bit of good-natured gossip!). Not too big on voice/videocalls and generally prefer texting. I'd say I present mostly as a soft masc. 

**Pros**

* I'm a good driver and love roadtrips, be my passenger princess!
* Also a great cook, and working on pastries/sweets as well. Extra good at bbq :D
* Easy-going and not the jealous type as long as communication is open and honest. 
* A bit of a gamer and willing to learn new games to play with you.
* Handy! Can fix stuff around the house, the car, and so on. 
* Willing to try lots of different types of hobbies, currently making cosplay props with eva foam. 
* Animal lover, no exceptions (except a slight jellyfish phobia).
* Some friends tell me I have a calming aura (?)
* Also love the place I live at, and make a perfect tour guide. 

**Possible Dealbreakers**

* I have at least one more year until I finish my PhD, so no plans to relocate in the very near future. 
* Diagnosed OCD, and although in therapy and medicated I'm prone to anxiety. 
* Possibly somewhere on the asexuality spectrum and (also possibly) a stone top (under investigation). 
* I have a dog that loves people and other animals, but isn't fond of most other dogs.
* Work in a high stress environment and go through periods where work is my first priority. 
* Don't want biological kids, but would be open to adoption/fostering, especially older ones. 
* Drink and smoke socially, a few times per year (i.e. birthdays, celebrations, holidays). 

**What I'm looking for:**

* Someone mature and communicative.
* Monogamous and up for something potentially serious and long term.
* A slight preference towards fem presenting people, but every gender identity and presentation is welcome! 
* Maybe someone who'd be up for eventually relocating to somewhere sunny? 
* If not willing to partake, someone who'd respect my hobbies and the time I spend on them (lots of early mornings for hiking and birding).

Let's start by getting to know each other and see where it goes! Feel free to message me with questions about myself, or introductions about yourself. Promise I'm extra nice🤞

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder, but I’ve always felt like there’s something else going on – another reason why my brain just works differently from others.
Right now everything feels way too much, and I get overwhelmed so easily. In public, I sometimes feel like a possum just freezing — as if the things that overwhelm me would care if I actually dropped dead 😂
This is where the internet (and all of you) come in. I started looking into ways to cope and somehow stumbled onto fidget toys and ADHD coping mechanisms. And honestly, it’s incredible how much clicks into place. I’ve tried several fidget toys (and destroyed a couple on the first day, lol), but I also found my favorite little squishy things and fidget atoms. (Does anyone know where to get a tiny version of those atoms, like an inch or so?)
Now I don’t tear napkins into 300 little balls in restaurants anymore. I don’t tap my legs constantly. I don’t scratch the glue off the seams of my bags. I just play around with my little squishy blob, and it actually helps.
I even tried some earplugs thanks to recommendations here. It still feels a bit strange, but I think I like them. Haven’t tested them in “hardcore” situations yet, but at least at home they’re working.
By now I’m pretty sure I have ADHD, but getting diagnosed here literally takes years because of the demand. Still, it’s such a relief (and sometimes really weird 🫣) to read that so many of you experience the same things. It’s definitely a reality check — turns out I’m not a superhero with super-hearing just because I can follow every single conversation in a coffee shop. Would’ve been cool, though. But hey, you get what you get and you don’t get upset.
Thanks to all of you 😘",1,1758394234.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

1nm67yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/1nm67yr/the_last_warm_day/,The Last Warm Day,"I just went grocery shopping, probably on the last warm day of the year, before it gets cold, dark, and gray again.

I had already seen her on the drive into town to the supermarket. I thought, WTF, she’s gorgeous. Wow.

I sat in the car, ate a snack, drank a coffee, and looked around. I wanted a little bit of hustle around me, people, cars, life. I wanted to see life, because I don’t have one.

Then I realized: shit, it’s her after all. I saw in the rearview mirrors that she was sitting there with her friend. They were talking about some girly stuff, some total nonsense. They were giggling, and that made me happy.

They were talking about something totally banal, then they laughed and were excited. Then I looked ahead and, across the street, there were two more. Maybe a year or two older. They were doing the same exact thing.

I kept looking around, seeing life left, right, up, down, glanced briefly at the rearview mirror, then forward, to the right, watching everything. Who’s driving by, what are they doing, what kind of car is that, that’s a cool motorcycle.

Then I looked forward again, the two girls were giggling again, and one of them waved and said hello in an exaggerated high voice. Maybe she waved a bit sarcastically in my direction, I don’t know. I wasn’t sure, I had only looked for a very short moment. Did they mean me or was she telling her friend something? Or was she teasing me a bit?

Of course she had her phone in her hand, because otherwise they don’t have anything in their hands, except maybe a Red Bull. No idea, maybe they also took a photo of me, nice and zoomed, it was only like fifty meters maybe, and I was really happy earlier when I felt their joy for life, and that was so nice, because I don’t have it, because I’m always alone and I’ll never experience that, definitely not anymore at my age.

I never experienced it, because at that age nothing was happening for me, as always. Then I thought, that would be so nice, and then I immediately thought: they can be so nice, but they can also be total monsters. If they don’t like you and you just glance in their direction for a second, they might take a photo of you and post it somewhere and label you a creep and a pig or whatever, just because they don’t like your nose.

If you’re a handsome guy, you could stare into their eyes for half an hour, no problem. Then I realized how quickly they can destroy someone’s life.

They can be sugar-sweet and in the next moment a total monster, without thinking a second about what they’re doing, like a small child, without thinking a second about the consequences of their actions. And then I thought: you know what, you can’t do anything to me, you can do absolutely nothing. Post it, even if I only looked in your direction for a total of thirty seconds in the last ten minutes and then smiled because it made me happy to see that joy for life, then go ahead.

Someday you might hear from friends, from male friends or maybe from your brother or your cousin, that someone did that to them and they maybe still had something to lose, and then you’ll realize what you did or almost did. But you can’t hurt me anymore. You can publish everything about me. You can publish any lies, just write whatever about what that guy did or who he is. You can do nothing to me, I’m already at rock bottom and have been here a long time and I know there’s absolutely no hope left.

I’m mentally stronger than all of you combined. 95% of you would have killed yourselves by thirty at the latest if you had lived my life. I’ve been here forty years, do what you can’t stop doing.

Maybe you can laugh about it for a minute or two or five. Maybe you’ll regret it someday too, but you can’t take anything from me anymore. I have nothing left to lose. 

I’m alone.

It's been a mix of late nights, endless coffee cups, and moments where I felt like I was running without a clear map. But there's something about building something from scratch that keeps me going.  

A turning point was realizing the power of short-form content to build an early audience. I started using tools like CapCut for quick edits and, believe it or not, HypeCaster.ai really proved useful for turning raw ideas into engaging short clips. This setup has helped me promote my faceless content without the need for a big budget or production team. Yet, staying consistent is a challenge on its own, and I'm sure many of you can relate.

I’ve also experimented with Notion to organize my brainstorm sessions and Zapier to automate repetitive tasks. It's fascinating to see how integrating these tools together can streamline efforts and make the workload feel a bit lighter. I'm still figuring things out and I'm curious to know, what underrated tools or hacks have helped you stay consistent in your startup journey?

Professionally they’ve been the ones to mentor me, to fight for promotions for me, encourage me, give me different career growth opportunities. Put me in positions to succeed. Also I had told my director I was having a rough week because I had to put my dog down, he messaged me to look in the fridge it was icecream. And honestly this type of thing happens a lot not the rough week. But guys maybe giving me fruit snacks, or helping me carry things. Covering the tab or buying a drink. Getting me coffee.

They aren’t asking me for anything though, and most of them are in committed relationships. Also I want to add I’ve had women do similar things but just not as frequent, my female coworker brought me an entire book series I mentioned and I’m had them bring me back sweets when they went to lunch. 

My friend said that men are only nice to me because they find me attractive and they aren’t doing those things because they think I’m a genuinely deserving person but because they find me attractive.

The brand-new romantic comedy from the most famous digital streamer has just premiered and is already a big hit. It stars former Nickelodeon teen star Miranda Cosgrove in her second Netflix original movie (her first original for the streamer was “Mother of the Bride,” another recent success on the platform) and Pierson Fodé (of ""The Perfect Date"").
Synopsis
Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), a metallurgical artist, lives in rural Texas with her grandmother Bird and her sisters. She dreams of following in her mother's footsteps and becoming a professional artist. A responsible person, Dawn has spent a long time working in a local coffee shop to save up her private fund to study art in Paris. She gets accepted into the university, but without a full scholarship, her savings aren’t enough.
However, one of her sisters, who is a reality TV show fanatic, suggests she sign up for the hottest show of the moment, “Honeypot.” It's a competition where selected women are guaranteed $20,000 for the chance to win the keys to a single rich guy's heart. Conveniently, the show is supposed to take place in the City of Light—or so the contestants thought.
After being selected and getting the affection of one of the show’s producers, Dawn is ready to arrive at the home of the Eiffel Tower. But she is surprised by the production's prank, the primary reason for the movie's title, as it lands her in Paris, Texas, less than 100 kilometers from her home. Staying in the competition only for contractual reasons, she soon catches the interest of the millionaire of the moment, Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fodé), a handsome cowboy. Initially determined to be eliminated, throughout the challenges, typical reality show intrigues, and some moments outside the game, she allows herself to fall for him.
Review and Opinion
Home to many successful relationship reality shows, Netflix pokes fun at its own productions. From the start, “Honeypot” is presented as a self-critique, a proper parody of the reality show genre. The entire structure and the characters involved are stereotypes of the most common human types to expose themselves in front of the cameras: the rich and spoiled influencer, the old-school biker, the nerd, the free spirit, the forgotten celebrity, the alternative girl, etc.
The film was directed by Janeen Damian, who has experience in the romantic comedy genre, having also directed two other Netflix productions in the same style: ""Falling for Christmas"" and ""Irish Wish."" In ""The Wrong Paris,"" she includes all the common and pleasant elements of romantic comedies, making it quite predictable, which is no demerit. After all, when we watch movies or series of this type, we want an escape valve from our chaotic daily lives, where we have little or no control over what happens around us. The constant presence of Dawn’s family is an especially nice touch, acting as the viewer's voice within the film.
Especially her grandmother Bird, the emotional component of the plot, who repeatedly advises and encourages her granddaughter. Sometimes she interferes in the story in a way the most anxious viewer would want to do themselves. Miranda brings lightness and humanity to the film. It's perfectly possible to feel indignant with her about the ""villain's"" not-so-subtle advances on the handsome millionaire. She conveys the character's insecurities well and definitely makes us fall in love with her, too, an essential element for any decent romantic comedy. Pierson fulfilled what was necessary for his character, delivering someone who is attentive, caring, handsome, and very much in love with the protagonist. There could have been a slight bit more chemistry between the two characters (am I being nitpicky? Maybe).
With beautiful landscapes and an interesting cast, the film also stands out for the quality of its production, which is ideal for the romantic comedy genre. Despite this, the film's story could have been better worked out. At 1 hour and 4 minutes long, the extremely light story (a good sign) goes by too quickly. There could have been better development of the villain and the protagonist's confidante through dialogue between them and the protagonist. In my opinion, there could have been more candid dialogue between the main couple, giving a more solid basis for their romance. Some moments between Paris, Texas, and Paris, France seem to happen with a kind of “express love” without much emotional foundation. Maybe 15 more minutes of film wouldn't have hurt the production.
With a keen critique of the superficiality of influencers and the world of reality shows as a backdrop, and limited by the genre's formulas, it could have promised more than just a simple romantic comedy. It is a light and pleasant film for an afternoon when you just want to turn off your brain and disconnect from your busy routine with cute moments starring lovable characters. I think it was meant to be a single movie, but it could have a sequel that expands this wonderful universe, especially the relationship between Dawn and her family, particularly her sisters.

1nm63c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1nm63c5/ex_with_history_of_threatening_suicide_reached/,"Ex with history of threatening suicide reached out and I ignored him, he ended his life. I don't feel guilty.","I dated this guy from 2009-2013. We had big plans together. We saved up to buy our favorite home near our apartment in the city we loved. We worked at the same company (different locations in town). We planned marriage and children. 
Then I discovered his lies and cheating. It was immense. He had been trying to break into comedy and was really taking off, I did everything I could to support that. He was booking big shows, traveling, small appearances in tv shows movies commercials. I handles all his admin, travel, accommodations, taxes, and everything so he could focus on that. I basically held two jobs and only one paid but all my spare time and effort was for his career. He was on dating apps everywhere he went he was meeting up with women. Not just the apps, paid services. He had women who thought they were in relationships. He had a whole separate hidden FB account. He'd tell people I was his live in assistant if they found out about me, or his cousin by marriage who was crashing with him. 

When I found out, I left. No notice, no talking it out. Just packed and left while he was out of town. 

He begged for months, making up more lies and stories about how it was a prank or he got hacked. I never responded. He kept saying he'd take his life if I didn't come back. I called a wellness check and he blew up on me because that could ruin his career. So I told my friends what was going on. He told everyone that I was a crazy jealous ex making up rumors to ruin his career. That he left ME accusing me of everything he had been doing. When I'd show them proof, he say it's edited and all fake. 

He'd make dozens of fake profiles to dm me the most hurtful insults. He got me fired from my job by doing things like breaking into my car and taking fuses out so I couldn't make it to work, moving my car so I couldn't find it. When I got it re keyed he broke windows, throw old milk and garbage inside, and I'd wake up to the damage. All causing me to be late multiple times a month. I bought cameras and would call the police and give them footage, and even when he was in it he'd take me to court and have ""witnesses"" saying he was with them the whole evening and get away with it. There was no winning, his family are all lawyers and I was a college drop out with a family of addicts, he made it seem like I was doing it all to tarnish his reputation and then sued me for defamation on top of it. I had to leave social media. When I'd start a new job he'd ask around until he found it and make fake complaints about me trying to get me fired. He'd walk by and make sure I noticed, point at me or wave. When I'd start dating someone he'd find them on social media and feed them horrible made up stories to make them leave me. He did to my friends too until I was all alone. It was like he was bent on ruining my life. 

He got married and through his entire marriage, he was doing all that to me. On their honeymoon he sent graphic photos and videos telling me it should have been me but I ruined any chances of that. For TEN YEARS he kept this up, even when I moved and changed cars and changed my name, and left my city. He always seemed to find a way no matter how hard I made it for him. But at least it was more spread out when it was more difficult for him. He even hired a professional investigator to find me at one point, which I found out from his ex wife. 

So he ended up divorcing and around that time his ex wife reached out to me. We had coffee. It was uncanny, we looked a lot alike. He even talked her into getting some of the same tattoos I had, dying and cutting her hair like mine. Wearing similar clothing. She had never known what I looked like, he deleted everything. He described me totally differently to her. So one day when she did see me, in a tagged photo a friend of theirs posted, he convinced her that I was changing my looks to copy her even though I had never seen her before and didn't even know he was married. Together they had told a bunch of people how crazy I was for doing that. She told me they did this and now she realized they must have been thinking she was delusional for saying that because they knew she changed drastically for him, and I had always looked this way. She started changing after that, going back to her own style and natural hair color, getting haircuts she preferred, wearing clothes she preferred, and he didn't like that. 

It turned out that he was also telling her all the same stories, that I was crazy jealous and trying to ruin him. This continued their entire relationship and marriage because she was also getting fake accounts insulting her and no matter how much she blocked them, it would keep coming. They got more and more personal. Multiple times she left social media. He told her it was me, and I did this to everyone he was close with or dating. I had never once done that. 

At one point it got threatening to the point it frightened her, she made him move with her, she made lifestyle changes to look different and not be in the same areas out of fear. They hired an investigator because he told her he was going to ""take care of it"" and then said afterwards id never bother her again and that's when it stopped happening to her. She felt like he was her protector and safety. Then she used his laptop and saw all the saved passwords for all the fake profiles he had made, They all had messages to her, to me. He tried to lie and say that I did that, he hacked them with the investigator and needed them for proof for court and she believed him at first. But he started doing it again, perhaps because in her assumption, it made them closer because she felt like he was her only safety. It was saying things only he knew though, and she was sure it was him now. So she left him. He threatened to hurt himself and take his life, she made him go to therapy but ended up divorcing. 

She and I didn't keep up. After what we went through with him, it was so extreme and painful we needed to heal. I got back online, started making new friends and finding new hobbies. It was cleansing for me and I started feeling better. 

Five years after that, he got sick. From what people told me later, it was alcoholism and failing liver. He looked really ill. He was struggling in life and dating. He reached out and went on a few dates with a gal I had been acquainted with when he and I had still been dating. We were still connected through other friends but not closely, he didn't know that. She reached out to tell me that she went on some dates with him and the entire time, he talked about me. How horrible I was, how ugly and fat and dumb I was, but also got wasted and started telling her how much she and I looked alike and asking her to wear certain things she knew I did, like she could look like me at their next date. He even bought her dresses and tops I recently wore and posted photos of, so he was certainly looking at my profile. She ghosted him and felt extremely weird about the whole thing and thought I should know. 

He didn't have any luck dating when he got sick. He was arrested in a motel while out of the state doing one of his shows, for solicitation. He started dating a 65 year old drug addict who got him into using meth and fentanyl. He stopped drinking and was telling everyone he was sober but just traded it for drugs. Then he started DMing me. 

He didn't hide himself this time. I had him blocked. He made a new account, used his name and photo. He sent dozens of messages. Apologies without specifics. Telling me about his days. Just taking to himself in my inbox. I didn't see them because the were in my request folder and I didn't use social media very often. When I found them, I didn't read them all. I got the gyst, blocked him and left it at that. He did it again. More aggressively now tho saying he knew I saw him, he knew I was reading them. Saying I needed to talk to him or he'd find me and make it face to face. He told me he was sick and he wanted to apologize face to face. He said he needed me to get better. That my leaving is what made him sick, and coming back would motivate him to get well. His 65 yo gf found the messages and started DMing me calling me degrading names saying to leave her man alone. I blocked them both, no response. 

His last messages came through while I was not actively using and checking my social media. I was debating whether I should delete it or not. When I logged in, I saw the posts first. A few local people to him I was still friends with posting RIPs and sentiments. I saw the messages next. He was furious, saying I ruined his relationship once again, how he can never move on from me because we both make it impossible to. Then begging, pleading for me to respond and come see him and just talk. Then threats, threats he would get me fired, find me and ""make my life hell"", threats that he would take his own life if I didn't talk to him. 

No one would release his cause of death. I did not reach out to his family or make any mention of it online. I didn't acknowledge him at all in any way. I looked up his obituary, his cousins (his only living family is two cousins on the opposite coast). All his exes, all his friends, everyone asking what happened and assuming he had succumbed to his illness, but no confirmations, no denials.

Then months later his ex wife reached out. She still had my number. I didn't have hers. She told me she didn't acknowledge him online or attend his services, but she went to his grave recently. He was buried next to his mother and father in a burial plot that was bought at their passing when he was just a kid, to ensure they would all be together. She had been there before, with him, and he bought the plot next to his for her when they married. She sold it. She went to pay respects privately but it was difficult and confusing. She was still hurt and was no contact. She didn't get messages or any harassment or attempts to reach out and she was even more upset and confused about why I did and she didn't, when they were married for so long. I didn't tell her that he was threatening to take his life in the messages, I felt like she might blame me and I was selfish. I didn't want to be seen as the bad guy anymore, I didn't want him controlling my image still. 

But she guessed as much. She made a vague post about losing someone she used to be very close to, and how she resented him because he repeatedly threatened to take his life. That's when she confirmed that he did commit suicide, he left a letter. I have no idea what it said, I didn't ask, and until then no one mentioned it. I dont want to know. He took a fatal dose of drugs, prescription pills, and drank himself to death in a motel room after a show. 

His 65 yo gf had not reported him missing or in danger even after being unable to reach him and suspecting he was going to hurt himself. She had been fighting with him over the messages to me, and being stubborn she didn't wasn't reach out first. It was the motel who reported it. Now the gf was online trying to get as much attention as possible from his following, posting their photos together saying they were going to get married and age deserved his money and assets, but he had never posted or talked about her on his real page. And his fake page was deactivated. There was no proof they were even together. His final attempt to control the narrative and make someone look crazy. 

I will admit I was conflicted at first. Yeah, I felt like it was my fault. I felt like a bad person, from ""bad breeding"", wondering if there was truth in his insults. But I lived. I lived through the hell he put me through. I had struggled many times and considered that my life was at the point I couldn't bare it any longer. That it was irredeemable, unfixable. That he had pushed me into a corner there was no getting out of. And I got out of it. I lived, I changed it, I managed. He couldn't live with it. 

There's hundreds maybe thousands of people who he's spun tales to that make me out to be a monster, and it's probably going to continue affecting me somehow even after he's gone. I think his ex wife and I are the only people who actually know what he was like and how far he would go. And there's no use in saying anything now. What would it do, but possibly reinforce what he already laid down? He's dead. He will be forgotten, we will move on, and it doesn't matter. He pulled the wool over so many people's eyes and it doesn't matter. I don't know them anymore, it isn't affecting me now, and if it does in the future I can remove myself and move on. He can't. He died with the only people he truly loved (or something like that, within whatever capacity he had)knowing exactly who he was. And that's enough. 

So I don't feel guilty anymore. I'm not at fault for his actions, his illnesses inside and out. He made all those choices, he had to live with it and he couldn't. I'm not his savior, I was his punching bag. I protected myself from a monster, and now that monster is gone. And I feel free. ",5,1758393834.0,okstorytime,3,0.86,False

Has anyone actually tried this “Luckin Coffee pre-order service” that lets you order without a Chinese phone number or WeChat/Alipay? I keep seeing those “new user” promos at Luckin that make drinks basically free, but as a visitor I can’t get past the app/phone/paywall mess.

Menu looks legit (Americanos, Lattes, Flat White, Mocha, Oat Milk Latte, and all the coconut specials like Iced Coconut Latte, Coconut Velvet Latte, etc.). You can tweak sweetness from Regular to No Extra Sugar and choose Ice. Seems perfect for beating the lines and the language barrier.

Two things I’m curious about before I try it in Chengdu:

How smooth is pickup at the store? Do baristas recognize the name/code easily, or do you need to show them anything special?

Anyone successfully stacked this with the Luckin “new user” promos via this service, or is it just standard menu pricing + their fee?

If you’ve used it in Chengdu (or elsewhere in mainland China), would love a quick rundown—timing, accuracy on customizations (less sugar vs tiny sugar), and whether delivery riders found you without a local number.

I am a 27-year-old, overall healthy (not including mental health) woman. However, one weird thing is that I have always loved salt.

As a kid, I would pour some into my palm and lick it. Nowadays I just make my food salty, and if it’s not made by me, I add tons of salt to it.

Unhealthy, right? Turns out no.

Whenever I am at a doctor’s office for a check-up, I mention that my blood pressure is always low or right at the borderline of normal-low. They always say “consume more salt.”

But I do. Oh, how I do. This low blood pressure is despite my salt intake.

People who have seen me add salt to my food have looked at me with wide eyes. I’ve felt like my eyes are finally open and I am finally focused after eating an entire party-size pack of Salt and Vinegar chips.

So today, I wake up, take my thyroid med, drink 2 cups of coffee, and eat a banana. I made an appointment for a haircut, so off to the salon I go.

It’s all good so far. I’m a bit nervous because I don’t even remember the last time I got a haircut. Has to be before the pandemic.

For years I had the good ol’ at-home salon, where the hair was assaulted more than cut.

I got off at the wrong bus stop even though I know the place, because I’m an idiot. Then, I have what I believe is the world’s fastest haircut. I swear the guy only took like 2 minutes. Whatever, it looks okay, what do I know. Some people have automated some things after doing them for God knows how long.

I pay a lot of money for the 2 minutes + 20-something years of experience of the guy and take my leave.
It’s all good still.

Across the road, I spy with my little eye a blood donation bank. Some of you will guess what’s gonna happen now.

Well, I always have low blood count anyway, so in the last decade whenever I tried to donate, they checked my blood to see whatever count they were looking for and said no. Sorry. Eat red meat, come back in a few months.

Ever since I turned 18, I have tried to donate at least 3 times a year. That makes 27 attempts so far. Only one was successful.

I fill out the forms. No, I have not had sex in exchange for money. No, I have never touched someone who was HIV+. No, I have not had tattoos recently. I have not been to Congo, nor do I have a relative who had mad cow disease.

I complete the form, give it to the nurses, they pinprick my middle finger and take a drop of blood. They put it in their little machine at the table and we wait a minute.

What do you know, I have enough of whatever they were looking for to make a donation.

GREAT. I’m gonna donate again for the second time.

I tried to donate bone marrow, stem cells, etc. too, but they told me not to even try.

My chronic disease does not allow me to be a candidate.

Because of hypothyroid. You take one pill in the mornings and don’t eat anything for 30 minutes. Whenever you feel like it, you get your blood work to see if the current dosage you’re on is fine.

Someone out there needs a bone marrow transplant for leukemia or some other type of horrible shit, I might be a match, but no. Evidently, I have the plague. You’re gonna die because my marrow is going to make you have a lazy thyroid, which is so expensive and hard to manage that you’d better not receive the marrow at all!

Okay, rant over. I just want to donate everything donatable.

They check my blood pressure. I tell them it’s usually low. They say “haha you said that about the blood count too,” and I chuckle.

It is 90/70.

Like I said before, either low or borderline acceptable.

I go see the doctor in the back, he asks me when was my last dentist appointment, for what, which medication I take regularly...

Once it’s decided that I am good enough to take blood from, I lay down on the chair/bed thingy. They arrange it so I am mostly horizontal and put a line in. Next 10 minutes, my precious life essence is flowing out of me into a 480ml plastic bag on a device that gently cradles it back and forth like a little baby.

It’s done. I get up gently, I know that my blood pressure is dodgy at the best of times so I move slow and sit down at the form-filling area, drink the complimentary soda and chill.

I feel 100% fine. So I leave.

It’s all good still. I walk like 15 minutes, weather is good, I decide to eat something full of sodium and shitty to replenish me.

Great, there is a Burger King right on my way.

I’ve been on a diet for the last few months—lost 6 kilos hehe—but I have plenty of cheat days where I don’t go crazy and I believe I deserve it. I mean, I must have lost some calories since almost half a litre of blood got taken out of me. I should be in deficit, I lie to myself.

I’m right in front of Burger King and so are this mother and son. The boy is about 12 maybe, pre-puberty definitely but kinda tall. You know that weird time when you first experience horniness but you’re such a noob at it that you google “boobs”? Kinda that age.

Suddenly these little glass balls spread everywhere. The boy had a bag of marbles and they scatter.

The mom is bitching already, “I told you to…” something something… “It’s already…” something something.

I decide to help the boy because things happen, I’m happy for his new marbles and sorry for the unpleasant mom.

This is where I fuck up.

I crouch down and start collecting the marbles. Some here, some over there, some waaay over there. The glass catches the light and reflects it so well that finding all of them is no problem at all.

I help the boy put them in a secure bag, he is so embarrassed he can’t look up but I give him a hair shuffle and go into the King.

The second I enter and right in front of the kiosk, I realize ohhhhh noooo. I won’t be able to order myself because my head is all fizzy.

Better sit down a bit first, let my veins know it’s all okay, help them with getting the blood up, fight against gravity and all.

I’ll be fine. It happens when I crouch down and get up multiple times.

But it gets worse. I’m cold-sweating like a motherfucker, light is too bright and my head does not want to be held up.

I kinda try to make the young woman at the soft-serve counter notice me so I can ask for something salty.

I finally do.

They bring me something and next thing I know I’m opening my eyes to the fluorescents of Burger King and almost all of its employees and customers looking down on me.

When the fuck did I faint?

My immediate thought is my phone and my bag. I ask for both of them ffs. Not gonna let them be stolen, I’m broke.

Once they are secure with me where they belong, I pay attention to the two women scurrying to my left. One is a worker here, I know her face, and another takes my hand and gently says to the other woman that they are a doctor.

I think OMG JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES. Someone goes down, people gather, one person says “I am a doctor” bla bla bla.

I am that someone who went down!

She is so gentle with me, asking questions while still holding my hand softly. I like her.

I’m saying I’m fine, really, donated blood, my blood pressure is usually low, I was fine till now but helped a boy so I had to crouch down a lot. I’m sorry for the hassle, please don’t worry, I don’t need an ambulance, it’s okay etc.

But the ambulance comes and I’m like holy shit I was out for at least a few minutes then cause I have no memory of anyone calling 112 and people around me are impatient with how long its taking.

EMTs are also nice. The main one that talks with me doesn’t believe I haven’t taken any drugs but I hold no hard feelings. With the amount of shit they see everyday and the lies they are told , I totally get their point. I assure her that I don’t even smoke or drink let alone do drugs. Not even weed.

They help me walk to the ambulance, the air outside is nice so I let the wind wake me up.

They take vitals, keep asking questions mostly to gauge my coherence I believe. Ohh, I just turned 27 last month, I work from home, they tell me eat more salt and I do, bla bla bla.

Everything is fine. It’s just a post-blood donation thing. They ask me if I want to be taken to the hospital and I’m like hell no. I sign some shit and the Burger King manager takes me in, I order my brioche burger with Coke Zero.

They are kind enough to bring it to me and I eat the slowest meal of my life.

Head down to the side on the table, putting fries into my mouth one by one. I slowly come to life.

Like Lazarus I have risen again, but my burger does not appetize me so I keep to the fries and Coke.

In ten minutes, fries have woken me up.

Also, the same doctor who held my hand and waited for the EMTs paid for my order even though I argued. My head was still fuzzy so I could not argue a lot because I had to sit down.

After making sure I’m not about to drop like a sack of 78-kilo potatoes again, I thanked everyone and apologized, assured them I am okay and went to the park down the street to lay down on the benches.

I got free fries, and a restored hope in humanity in exchange for 480ml of old blood.

TL;DR: Impromptu decision to donate blood, my body, and crouching down made me faint.
People were wonderful about it and I am totally fine now.

Needless to say, we were worried about little Shadow meeting Magnus. But never did I ever expect what has happened. Magnus is a whole different cat with Shadow. He lets Shadow harass him day and night, biting his tail, eating his food, stealing his toys. He has shown a saintly level of care and patience for the little guy.

Have you ever felt like you're on the edge of something HUGE, but you’re just... standing still? Like watching an epic parade go by while you sip your lukewarm coffee? 🎉☕ 

That’s kind of how I feel about the current AI gold rush! We're literally living in a time where AI can help us work smarter, not harder. But here's the kicker: if we don’t upskill *NOW*, we might just be left holding a coffee cup as the parade rolls on. 

**Why you should hop on this train:**

- 🎯 **Skyrocketing Demand**: Companies are crawling all over AI skills. Seriously, every job post seems to mention some form of AI knowledge. Are you ready to grab that attention?
- 📈 **Flexibility Galore**: AI isn’t just for tech wizards anymore. Writers, marketers, educators... even my grandma can leverage it. (Kidding, but you get the point!)
- 🔍 **Future-Proofing**: The buzz around AI isn’t going anywhere. Think of it like investing in a great stock, but instead, you’re investing in your own skills. 

**How can we get started?**

1. **Find Your Flavor**: What aspect of AI excites you? Programming? Content creation? Data analysis? Pick it like you’d choose toppings on a pizza! 🍕
2. **Dive into Resources**: There are tons of great platforms out there. I recently checked out this program from Imagine Education that made grasping AI concepts super relatable and fun! (You can find it [here](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals)). Trust me; it’s worth checking out!
3. **Connect with Peers**: Join communities—like AiContentAutomators! Share insights, learn together, and don’t hesitate to ask questions. Remember, nobody knows it all! 
4. **Practice**: Start small. Maybe use AI tools for a side project or just to automate mundane tasks. You’d be amazed at what you can do!

But hey, let’s add some humor here: If you're thinking about avoiding the grind and chilling on the couch while the rest of us hustle, just remember—couch-fishing for compliments won’t pay the bills! 😂

In all seriousness, this is a pivotal moment. The world of AI is expanding so fast, and it can be overwhelming—but it’s also exciting! Just think of the perks that come with upgrading your skills. 🎉✨ 

So, what are your thoughts? Are any of you already diving into AI skills? What do you find most challenging or rewarding about it? 🤔",1,1758393269.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I packed, kissed him goodbye, and figured the worst I’d come home to was a sink full of dishes.

Day two, he texted: “Don’t worry, I’m building a hydroponic herb wall.”

Translation: he duct-taped mason jars to the living room blinds.

By the end of week one, he’d “gone off the grid” inside our own house—turned off the Wi-Fi to “reconnect with his inner caveman” and started whittling sticks from the backyard into “tools.” Our dog now refuses to fetch anything that looks remotely sharpened.

Week two: he decided to ferment his own kombucha. We don’t own the proper jars, so he used the pasta pot. It hissed like a baby dragon for three days and exploded at 3 a.m. The kitchen still smells like what I imagine a pirate’s laundry basket would.

Laundry? He wore the same hoodie until it achieved the texture of wet cardboard. He calls it his “armor.” The dog calls it a personal space violation and has taken permanent refuge under the guest bed.

I walked in last night to find him in candlelight, strumming an out-of-tune ukulele and quoting “Walden” like a man who’s seen the forest and will never return.

This morning, he whispered to me, perfectly serious: “The kombucha speaks now.”

I’m drinking my first real coffee in weeks, trying not to laugh—or cry. My house looks like a failed science fair. The dog and I are just… processing.

1nm5s4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1nm5s4w/reveal_the_truth_about_cleaning_and_co_allpurpose/,Reveal the Truth About Cleaning and Co All-Purpose Cleaner,"**Testing the Cleaning & Co. B0D1VR3NLQ: A Multipurpose Marvel**

My experience with the Cleaning & Co. B0D1VR3NLQ has been nothing short of eventful. As someone who constantly battles everyday messes in a busy household, I was intrigued by the powerful claims of this multipurpose cleaning gel. It's heralded as an all-in-one solution for kitchens, bathrooms, floors, laundry, and even furniture. Over the course of several weeks, I incorporated it into my routine, tackling everything from stovetop grease to muddy boot tracks. Let me unpack my thoughts on this cleaner.

**The Design of the Bottle Matters**

This might sound trivial, but I have to say I loved the compact and ergonomic shape of the bottle. The dimensions (6.85 x 3.66 x 3.62 inches) make it easy to hold, especially when you’re multitasking during cleaning sprees. The nozzle design allows for both precision application of the thick gel and the ability to squeeze out just the right amount when mixing it with water. Though the packaging is functional, some might argue it lacks a certain ""premium"" look. Personally, I prefer functionality over aesthetics when it comes to cleaning products.

**How Does It Perform?**

Performance is where the gel truly shines (pun intended). From greasy stovetops in my kitchen to grimy tiles in the shower, this stuff powered through each mess with ease. The clingy consistency of the gel is a standout feature. When applied to stubborn stains, it just stays put, breaking down the grime without sliding away. It even worked wonders on the notoriously dusty nooks of my patio furniture. And the best part? No residue was left behind on my tiles or counters.

**Strengths**

- Long-lasting pine scent that's invigorating without being overly strong  
- Works on various surfaces, from tiles to stainless steel  
- Gel formula clings to grime for deep cleaning action  
- No streaks or residue; surfaces dry spotless  

See [Cleaning & Co. B0D1VR3NLQ] price on Amazon.

**Refreshing Pine Aroma**

The scent of cleaning products often feels like an afterthought, but not with this one. A few minutes after using it, my home smelled like a pristine pine forest—delightful, to say the least. It didn't have the sharp, chemical tang that many cleaners carry, which is a huge win in my book. Even my coworker, who popped in for coffee, commented on the refreshed air. Imagine cleaning and getting a subtle air freshener for free.

**Limitations**

- The gel is a bit tricky to rinse off entirely unless you're using sufficient water  
- While versatile, some surfaces might still require specialized cleaners for optimal results  
- A tad pricier compared to generic cleaning solutions  

**Cling Power: Ideal for Stubborn Messes**

Its heavy-cling action changed the game for me when cleaning vertical surfaces like tiled shower walls. I applied a generous amount, let it cling for a few minutes, and with minimal effort, layers of soap scum and hard water stains slid away. This was oddly satisfying to watch! That said, I did notice that rinsing thoroughly is key; otherwise, small patches of the gel might stick around.

**Competitors**

While the gel impressed me, I couldn’t help but consider how it stacks up against similar products. Competing options like Method All-Purpose Cleaner and Mr. Clean’s Magic Eraser excel in terms of ease of application and fast-touch cleaning. The key differentiator is the gel’s incredible cling power and pine scent. Though other products might offer speed, they often lack the thoroughness this gel provides. That said, if quick sprays are your go-to, you may find this gel less convenient.

**True Value**

Considering its ability to replace several other products, I would say it offers excellent financial value. It’s versatile enough that I didn’t reach for my separate floor, countertop, or bathroom cleaners for weeks. While the initial price might feel slightly on the higher side, the fact that you need minimal product per use means a single bottle can last ages. The cost-to-benefit ratio makes it a worthwhile purchase, especially for households looking to simplify their cleaning routines.

1nm5oal,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomadFIRE/comments/1nm5oal/trip_report_kuala_lumpur_malaysia_16th_to_26th/,"[Trip Report] Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 16th to 26th August","I stayed in *Brickfields* (aka Little India), just south of the famous skyscrapers, for 10 days while working remotely. Sharing my thoughts here for anyone considering KL as a short digital nomad stop or solo trip.

# Location & First Impressions

Brickfields is a convenient base. It’s only a 5-minute walk to Central Mall and KL Sentral station, which connects you directly to the airport in 30 minutes for about £10. The area is busy and diverse, though honestly not as clean as Chiang Mai (where I was before this).

One of the coolest everyday things: hearing Hindu temple bells, the Muslim adhan, and Taoist chants all within earshot. KL is multi-faith in a way you can *literally* hear.

# Food Scene

If you like Indian food, you’ll be spoiled. Brickfields has phenomenal South Indian restaurants and some of the best Hyderabadi biryani I’ve ever had.

In Central Mall, there’s a hawker-style food court where meals run around £3. The Japanese curry rice and Malaysian grill stalls stood out, but some of the noodle soups tasted rubbery or stale.

Food delivery is cheap (under £2, even less if you take the “delayed” option) and the variety beats Thailand hands down: Malaysian, Chinese (dim sum, Sichuan, HK-style), South/North Indian, Thai chicken rice, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Korean, plus all the usual fast food chains.

Coffee and tea culture is fun to explore. Some of the Malaysian kopi has unusual flavors, but it’s worth trying them all.

# Accommodation (Riviera Apartments)

I stayed in a new high-rise block Riveria city still under construction. The pros: modern rooms, reasonable prices for the quality, insane views of KL’s skyline, and even Thean Hou Temple in sight. There’s also an included coworking lounge on the top floor that was a huge bonus.

The cons: cold pool and jacuzzi (no heating), a small gym with only 4 machines although access was included, and elevators that were always crowded since the building isn’t finished yet.

https://reddit.com/link/1nm5oal/video/ywj2e2am4dqf1/player

# Coworking (Colabs, Central Mall)

I worked from Colabs between Aug 17–23. A weekly pass gives you 7 working days, but note: they close on weekends and at 5 pm sharp.

Seating in the front area is uncomfortable for long hours, but staff kindly let me use the event hall most days, which had much better desks and chairs. If they hadn’t, I’d knock off at least 1.5 stars.

Being in a mall is convenient though: loads of food, Old Town Café upstairs, and that hawker area just downstairs. Only downside is mall air-con—it can be freezing if you’re in shorts and a T-shirt.

# Getting Around

KL has an extensive metro system and taxis are affordable (\~£10 to the Bird Park). I tried the bus once but found the system confusing—you need a Touch ’n Go card, and buying one was a hassle.

The city is roughly half cash, half card. It’s unpredictable which places take which, so keep both handy.

# Things I did

* **KL Bird Park** – a massive open-air aviary with free-roaming birds. Surprisingly good.
* **Thean Hou Temple** – visible from my apartment; beautiful and popular for weddings.
* **Museum / Arts District** – near the Bird Park you’ll also find the National Museum and Islamic Arts Museum. I didn’t make it, but they’re walkable.

# Observations

* KL is more affordable than it looks street food and Nasi Kandar canteens are cheap and filling.
* English is widely spoken, so communication is never a problem.
* You’ll notice more visible homelessness. Interestingly, KL is also one of the most blind-accessible cities I’ve seen, with lots of visually impaired people navigating independently.
* Morning walks in Brickfields mean bumping into local school kids one of those daily-life snapshots that make a place feel real. It calms you down for some reason.

Each has a packet of electrolytes in it. The first bottle lasts me close to 20 miles and by the time I get home i'm half done with the second bottle.

Just wanted to ask for some general advice. I am officially starting my 16 day fast, but this time I am also going to be working out everyday. I have done 10 days fasts in the past but that was without electrolytes and working-out, which was painful to say the least. I had no clue what I was doing back then. I was so pallid after it, my friends all thought I was ill. 

Anyways, this time I figured I will take electrolytes and work-out simultaneously while fasting. For people who did work-out while fasting, I am curious to see if working out accelerated the fat burning process and to what extent? Realistically, how much more would I lose if I am already burning 1800 calories by being sedentary? I know most of my weight loss constitutes mostly of water during fasts, but I want to know how much fat I would also realistically lose? I also routinely drink Black Coffee everyday, would that stunt my progress? Anyways, I will keep track of my progress and post it during this journey. Thank you!

I've rearranged all my kitchen cupboards and drawers in the past few hours and had a big ol' declutter and rearranged all the stuff on my worktops and made it pretty minimalist. If you are into organising, and finding little boxes and baskets to store things in, read on as I need help! 😏

I keep my medication in the cardboard box that it gets delivered in, which sits next to my tea/coffee/sugar cannisters in the kitchen. If I don't keep it there, I'll forget to take them, so they need to be out on the worktop, next to the tea stuff.

My parents don't know I have adhd or that I'm on medication.. and even though I'm a 40 yr old woman, I can't really be arsed with them finding out by somehow finding my pills and then asking me all about it and (all that comes with that!)... I reckon my Mom would open the box one day by mistake cus it looks like a parcel or something..

So..I'm looking for a smaller box to put my x2 bottles of Elvanse pills in. Maybe a little tin? Something subtle to everyone else! 

Also the cardboard box is a bit ugly anyway. 

Let me know if you spot anything please. I don't want to decant the medication into pill boxes, I just want something (not transparent) to put the two pill boxes in. Needs a lid too. ",1,1758392336.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

I was wondering if there are fellow Filipinos/Filipino Americans here in Astoria who would be interested in creating a fun and supportive little community for us.

I’m imagining simple but meaningful get-togethers like:
Coffee or brunch
Happy hours & dinners
Potluck parties (because food is love!)
Karaoke nights (because what’s a Filipino group without this, right? 😅)
Walks and casual hangouts around the neighborhood

The idea is just to connect, share laughs, enjoy good food, and build friendships.

All genders are welcome. Age-wise, I was thinking late 20s to early 40s might be the sweet spot, but there’s really no restriction—if you’re younger or older and want to join, you’re more than welcome. What matters is wanting to meet new people, make new friends, and create community.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, drop a comment or DM me and let’s make a first hangout happen! Tara na! 🙌",16,1758392310.0,astoria,6,0.83,False

1nm5f7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1nm5f7y/considering_going_caffeine_free/,considering going caffeine free,"i am a college student who started having caffeine from coffee when i was in high school. my current vice is energy drinks. since the school semester started back up my intake has also gone up. my parents dont let me drink energy drinks when i am at home and while i can obviously get them myself when i go out this past summer i mostly was just having one to three cups of coffee and that was it.

now im back at school and having probably three or four 200 mg energy drinks per day. im a senior in college and for the last two years this has been my routine. ive was also taking psuedoephedrine for the last two years nearly every day. i stopped this over the summer and have not taken it since. i dont intend to start again.

anyway my energy levels have completely plummeted in the last two weeks and waking up in the morning has become a TRIAL. this was not the case over the summer when i was having much less caffeine. im thinking that the caffeine is to blame for my exhaustion and considering cutting it out completely or at least reducing it to no more than 200 mg per day.

does anyone have any advice on starting this process? what will the next few days/weeks look like? is there a substantial difference between no caffeine and 200 mg? thanks in advance :)",2,1758392220.0,CaffeineFreeLife,3,1.0,False

	•	What neighborhoods or areas are best (and safest) to stay in for hotels? Ideally somewhere walkable to food, coffee, and good spots to explore.
	•	Any must-try restaurants, cafes, or bars you’d recommend?
	•	Things I should know ahead of time (weather, transportation tips, areas to avoid, etc.)?

Would love a mix of local gems and classic tourist stops. Thanks in advance!

1nm5dvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nm5dvf/the_last_warm_day/,The Last Warm Day,"I just went grocery shopping, probably on the last warm day of the year, before it gets cold, dark, and gray again.

I had already seen her on the drive into town to the supermarket. I thought, WTF, she’s gorgeous. Wow.

I sat in the car, ate a snack, drank a coffee, and looked around. I wanted a little bit of hustle around me, people, cars, life. I wanted to see life, because I don’t have one.

Then I realized: shit, it’s her after all. I saw in the rearview mirrors that she was sitting there with her friend. They were talking about some girly stuff, some total nonsense. They were giggling, and that made me happy.

They were talking about something totally banal, then they laughed and were excited. Then I looked ahead and, across the street, there were two more. Maybe a year or two older. They were doing the same exact thing.

I kept looking around, seeing life left, right, up, down, glanced briefly at the rearview mirror, then forward, to the right, watching everything. Who’s driving by, what are they doing, what kind of car is that, that’s a cool motorcycle.

Then I looked forward again, the two girls were giggling again, and one of them waved and said hello in an exaggerated high voice. Maybe she waved a bit sarcastically in my direction, I don’t know. I wasn’t sure, I had only looked for a very short moment. Did they mean me or was she telling her friend something? Or was she teasing me a bit?

Of course she had her phone in her hand, because otherwise they don’t have anything in their hands, except maybe a Red Bull. No idea, maybe they also took a photo of me, nice and zoomed, it was only like fifty meters maybe, and I was really happy earlier when I felt their joy for life, and that was so nice, because I don’t have it, because I’m always alone and I’ll never experience that, definitely not anymore at my age.

I never experienced it, because at that age nothing was happening for me, as always. Then I thought, that would be so nice, and then I immediately thought: they can be so nice, but they can also be total monsters. If they don’t like you and you just glance in their direction for a second, they might take a photo of you and post it somewhere and label you a creep and a pig or whatever, just because they don’t like your nose.

If you’re a handsome guy, you could stare into their eyes for half an hour, no problem. Then I realized how quickly they can destroy someone’s life.

They can be sugar-sweet and in the next moment a total monster, without thinking a second about what they’re doing, like a small child, without thinking a second about the consequences of their actions. And then I thought: you know what, you can’t do anything to me, you can do absolutely nothing. Post it, even if I only looked in your direction for a total of thirty seconds in the last ten minutes and then smiled because it made me happy to see that joy for life, then go ahead.

Someday you might hear from friends, from male friends or maybe from your brother or your cousin, that someone did that to them and they maybe still had something to lose, and then you’ll realize what you did or almost did. But you can’t hurt me anymore. You can publish everything about me. You can publish any lies, just write whatever about what that guy did or who he is. You can do nothing to me, I’m already at rock bottom and have been here a long time and I know there’s absolutely no hope left.

I’m mentally stronger than all of you combined. 95% of you would have killed yourselves by thirty at the latest if you had lived my life. I’ve been here forty years, do what you can’t stop doing.

Maybe you can laugh about it for a minute or two or five. Maybe you’ll regret it someday too, but you can’t take anything from me anymore. I have nothing left to lose. 

I’m alone.
