-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enhancing your outdoor living space can be both enjoyable and beneficial, especially when considering the charm and functionality of a propane fire pit coffee table. This piece of furniture marries the comfort of a traditional coffee table with the warmth and ambiance of a fire pit, creating a unique centerpiece for your patio or backyard.

One of the primary advantages of a propane fire pit coffee table is the convenience it offers. With a simple push of a button, you can ignite a warm glow that makes chilly evenings much more enjoyable. This feature sets it apart from traditional wood-burning fire pits, which require kindling and ongoing maintenance. Imagine hosting friends for a casual evening where you enjoy your favorite beverages around a cozy flame without the hassle of tending to logs and ashes. It’s a seamless experience that allows you to focus on what really matters: having fun with loved ones.

Another significant benefit is the aesthetic appeal. A propane fire pit coffee table comes in various styles, designs, and materials, allowing you to find one that complements your outdoor décor. Whether you prefer a sleek modern look or a rustic design, there’s something out there for everyone. This versatility not only enhances your patio’s overall beauty, but also serves as a conversation starter for visitors.

Beyond aesthetics, safety is a top concern when it comes to outdoor fire features. Propane fire pit coffee tables are designed with safety in mind. They are typically equipped with a protective glass barrier, ensuring that flames stay contained and reducing the risk of accidental burns or injuries. This makes them a safer choice for homes with children or pets. Additionally, propane burns cleaner than wood, producing fewer emissions and less smoke, which is especially beneficial for users who are sensitive to air quality.

A propane fire pit coffee table into your outdoor setup also adds versatility. These tables serve multiple purposes. During the day, it can function as a regular coffee table where you can place snacks or drinks while enjoying the sun. At night, it transforms into a warm gathering spot that radiates light and heat. The dual functionality means you can maximize your outdoor space without cluttering it with additional furniture.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-fire-pit-coffee-table  
  
Here are additional benefits to consider:

- **Easy Setup**: Unlike traditional fire pits that require digging and heavy construction, propane fire pit coffee tables are ready to use right out of the box. Just connect the propane tank, and you’re good to go.
- **Adjustable Flame**: Most units allow for flame height adjustment, which means you can personalize the ambiance according to your mood or needs.
- **Low Maintenance**: Cleaning and maintenance are easier compared to wood burning pits, requiring only occasional checks for propane levels and surface cleaning.
- **Year-Round Use**: You can enjoy your propane fire pit coffee table throughout different seasons, providing warmth in the cool months and a gathering place in warmer weather.

Cost-effectiveness is another crucial factor. While the initial investment in a propane fire pit coffee table may seem significant, it can lead to long-term savings. Propane tends to be cheaper than purchasing and storing firewood, and due to its efficiency, you may find that you use less fuel overall. This makes it a cost-effective and hassle-free alternative for your outdoor heating needs.

If you’re an entertainer, a propane fire pit coffee table is a must-have. It sets the perfect scene for evening social gatherings, family events, or romantic dinners under the stars. The light from the flames creates a warm atmosphere, making any occasion feel special. You can even roast marshmallows for s'mores or prepare supper with adjustable heating. The inclusion of a fire table creates a welcoming environment that invites friends and family to linger longer.

With so many benefits, a propane fire pit coffee table can transform your outdoor living space into a versatile, safe, and enjoyable area. So, why not consider this unique piece of furniture? You’ll create lasting memories and elevate your outdoor experience, making every moment spent outside a delightful one.

How to Choose the Right Propane Fire Pit Coffee Table for Your Home
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating the perfect outdoor space, a propane fire pit coffee table can be an excellent addition to your home. This versatile piece not only provides warmth and ambiance but also serves as a functional table for snacks, drinks, or gatherings. Choosing the right one, however, involves more than just picking a nice design. Here are several key factors to consider to ensure you select the perfect propane fire pit coffee table for your needs.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-fire-pit-coffee-table  
  
### Consider Your Space

Before diving into styles and features, assess your outdoor area.

- **Size:** Measure your space to determine how much room you have for a fire pit coffee table. A table that's too big can overwhelm your area, while one that’s too small may not create the desired focal point.
- **Layout:** Take into account existing furniture. Will the new table fit comfortably among your outdoor seating, or will it make the area feel cramped?

### Material Matters

The material of your propane fire pit coffee table will affect both durability and aesthetics. Common materials include:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-fire-pit-coffee-table  
  
- **Steel:** A strong and affordable choice. Look for weather-resistant finishes to extend its life.
- **Aluminum:** Lightweight and rust-resistant, ideal for easy movement and maintenance.
- **Wicker:** Offers a stylish appearance but ensure it is weather-resistant for longevity.
- **Stone or Ceramic:** Provide a luxurious look but might be heavier and less portable.

### Style and Design

Your propane fire pit coffee table should reflect your personal taste and complement your outdoor decor. Consider these design elements:

- **Shape:** Round, square, or rectangular? The shape can influence the flow of your space.
- **Color:** Choose a color that aligns with your existing furniture or outdoor theme.
- **Aesthetic:** Traditional, modern, rustic, or contemporary? Your selection should harmonize with your overall outdoor style.

### Fire Pit Features

Different propane fire pit coffee tables come with various features that can enhance your outdoor experience:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-fire-pit-coffee-table  
  
- **BTU Output:** Higher BTU means more heat. Consider what level of warmth you desire.
- **Flame Control:** Look for adjustable flame settings to control the fire's intensity according to your mood.
- **Safety Features:** Ensure it has safety shut-off valves and protective screens to keep flames contained.
- **Storage:** Some models offer hidden compartments for storing propane tanks or even cushion storage.

### Budget Consideration

Establishing a budget is crucial before shopping. Propane fire pit coffee tables can vary widely in price, depending on material, size, and features. Set a budget that aligns with your financial capacity, and remember to consider long-term costs such as maintenance and propane refills.

### Customer Reviews and Recommendations

Research is key! Look for online reviews to gain insights from fellow owners about performance and satisfaction. Sites like Amazon, home improvement stores, or dedicated outdoor furniture websites often provide customer feedback. Seek recommendations from friends or family who may have recently purchased a propane fire pit coffee table.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-fire-pit-coffee-table  
  
### Assembly and Maintenance

Some fire pit coffee tables require assembly, while others arrive ready to use. If you’re not comfortable with tools, you might want to opt for a pre-assembled model. Additionally, ask about maintenance: Certain materials may require special care or regular upkeep to keep them looking their best.

### Final Thoughts

By considering these aspects — space, material, style, features, budget, customer feedback, and maintenance — you'll be well-equipped to choose the right propane fire pit coffee table. Not only will it enhance your outdoor ambiance, but it will also create a cozy gathering spot for family and friends. Enjoying a backyard fire under the stars has never been easier!

### Conclusion

Embracing outdoor living spaces becomes a delightful experience with the addition of a propane fire pit coffee table. Its multifunctional nature not only brings warmth but also serves as an inviting centerpiece for gatherings with family and friends. Imagine sipping your favorite drink while enjoying the flickering flames illuminating your evenings. The ambiance created by these fire tables enhances your outdoor area, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and socialization.

Him and his girlfriend broke up and that threw him over the edge. He hasn’t been sleeping and he’s been staying up all night. He seems very stressed and worried leading up the a few days ago but what he told me is worrying me really bad. 

I was hanging out with my girlfriend a few days ago and he came up to me and told me to come outside and leave my phone inside. I was confused but did so anyway. We went outside and my dad looked me in the eyes and said that I need to be a man and listen. He said that he believes that cops in our town are watching us and are trying to kill us as to take my grandmothers life savings(we live with her) he told me that they are watching and he listening so I have to be careful. He said he told the people listening to him through his phone that he knows. He even told his therapist about these things and he called the cops to my house to make sure my father wasn’t going insane or something I don’t know. 

My grandma and my aunt are all in agreement that there is no threat to our lives and my dad is acting crazy. The point of all this is I’m scared and my dad really thinks this is happening and I dont know how to handle this situation. I’m only sixteen and this shit is fucking crazy so if anyone could possibly throw out some ideas on how to handle this I’d appreciate it.

His condition had been deteriorating rapidly for weeks. He hardly had control over his own body anymore, and he was so, so frustrated with himself. Alzheimer’s is such a cruel disease. 

His last day on earth, I held his hand and told him that I would be ok. That he didn’t have to keep hanging on for my sake and although I’d miss him terribly, I wanted him to be in a better place. The hospice nurse called to tell me he’d passed the very next morning. 

I strongly believe he was hanging on until I could say goodbye. He managed to get out the words “love ya” a few days before and they were the last ones I’d ever hear him say. I would do anything in the world to hear them just one more time. 

I miss you, Papa. I know that I wasn’t the perfect granddaughter and there are things I wish I’d done differently now that you’re gone, but I’ll never forget everything you did for me.

1hhm74t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hhm74t/did_i_fumble_the_barista/,Did I fumble the barista?,"
I (19M) met this barista (17F) that works in coffee shop connected to the books a million. She is new and I have gone in and seen her and chatted with her a few times. Things had felt really good, making a lot of good eye contact, conversation flowed well, and an overall good vibe. I wasn’t sure how to approach getting her number so I decided to leave a little message on a sticky note inside the cash tip I handed her. I did this so it wouldn’t be putting her on the spot as she is new to the job and I didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable.

Leading up to giving her the note, the conversation was good but I was slightly nervous because I’ve never done something like this while trying to get a girl. Once she handed me my coffee I pulled out the five containing the note and tipped her. It was a very not smooth ending because I said “oh yeah, tip” and set it on the counter and walked away. I forgot to say thank you or have a good day. Idk why but after that I was tweaking and felt like I messed it up really bad. Also I didn’t quite have the note sticking out of the cash and there is a chance she put it in the tip jar without seeing the note instead of unfolding the bill and reading the note.

that was yesterday at like 7:30pm and now it’s the day after at 11pm and she hasn’t added me on Instagram or texted me. I told my friend about it and he found her Instagram somehow. Idk what to do. I’m kinda scared to ever go back there. One of my friends said I should go back and bring it up. Another friend said leave it be and she’ll text you if she wants. And another friend said preemptively follow her on Instagram and message her. Idk what to do but I don’t think that last piece of advice was good at all.

I'm not the happiest owner of an Asus ProArt PX13 laptop, and the picture of what I've seen while reading lots of topics and YouTube videos is quite different from what I've got after buying this laptop.

My wife and I call this laptop a ""gym bro"" because it's powerful but dumb.

# Why Asus ProArt PX13?

I bought this laptop because I travel a lot and I really wanted to get something easy to carry and powerful that will allow me to easily edit videos or even play some games like RDR2. The ProArt PX13 seemed good to me.

# So let's start with pros and cons!

# Pros:

* Definitely lightweight and easy to carry
* Powerful for editing video or working with Figma, Miro, and other stuff
* Convenient keyboard: I personally like its sound and texture
* 3K screen

So the pros are clear: it's super powerful, it's lightweight, and it's designed for creators.

# Cons:

* Sooooo many bugs
* Terrible technical support from Asus
* Too many drivers and control panels
* The stylus broke on the first day and can't be repaired, so it's useless
* The power adapter is too big and most of the time inconvenient to use
* The laptop lives its own life
* They include the backpack in the package, so that means you pay for it even if you don't need it

I said I was trying to be unbiased, but to be honest, I am writing this topic to warn people who are looking to buy this product about the problems that I have faced. THIS LAPTOP HAS OFTEN BECOME A PAIN IN THE ASS!

So let's start with the beggining. 

# Backpack in the box

They really included the useless backpack in the box, and that means you pay for it. I have a better one, so I didn't really need a piece of garbage in my room. But okay, let's move on...

# Stylus

Stylus... It fell from a magazine table's height, and the changeable stylus head broke. I read a lot of topics, and nobody could repair or change it. I went to the Asus service center, and they said they can't help: I should buy a new one for $100. Other repair services couldn't help me replace the head as well.

**So basically all the additional stuff they put in the box is useless**

# Power adapter

It was my concern when buying this laptop. It's quite big and heavy, but it's not the real problem. The real problem is that they made the cable from the plug to the adapter too short. So in many places, like coffee shops or coworking places, the plugs are at table height. This means I have to leave this huge thing on the table because the cable is not long enough to put the power box on the floor.

This creates a lot of mess on my table. I don't like it.

# Drivers and control panels

That's a huge issue. After 3 months of usage, I still have no idea how to manage this device because I have too many different places to control:

* Windows power settings
* ProArt control panel (super inconvenient)
* Nvidia control panel
* AMD control panel

And you really have to pay attention to these, because if you don't, it's going to lag, or the battery life instead of 5 hours will drop to like 1.5. So you can't just ignore these things. I truly hate it.

# Bugs, lags and inconveniences

OMG, this laptop is truly a disaster. I previously had an Asus laptop designed for business purposes, and it was perfect. Now, almost every day, I have a challenge: sometimes USB doesn't work, sometimes it cannot wake up after sleep, sometimes it cannot rotate the screen after you use it as a tablet... So many tasks for me to solve. I didn't want to pay for that.

You probably think I should solve it with Asus's service center. I thought the same...

# Asus tech support

It is another pain in the ass.

Because I travel, I have to contact support in different countries. They always have different opinions on every problem, but there is one thing they all agree on: I should leave them my laptop for who knows how long (it's usually more than a week; once they said I should leave it for a month). So they don't give you any other device to use for this time. You just lose your own for an extended period. And also, they said that it's better to backup and delete all the stuff from the laptop.

So for me, that doesn't look like an option. And I always have to solve everything on my own. By googling, searching, and asking other people, etc.

# Overall opinion

To summarize, I wouldn't buy it again. It isn't worth it.

The product seems to be very raw. Even though it's lightweight and powerful, I would try something else on the market. For me, this laptop is the reason not to buy Asus products in the future.

I'd like to discuss your experience and opinion in the comments

I rarely check Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter... for the same reasons as most people who stay off these platforms. And I do not have a TikTok account.

Yesterday, I uninstalled this app called REDnote on my phone. It's a Chinese app, a combination of Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, and Pinterest. It can be informative but also destructively addictive.

I uninstalled the app last year because of the toxicity. This year, I went back to it again because I was bored and lonely, a decision I came to regret. Not only did I expose myself to online bullying again, but I realized that just like Instagram and TikTok, the chatter generated on this platform influenced me to make unnecessary purchases, like some makeup products that I probably won't use much, and coffee. Yeah, I bought coffee from a brand just for the free plush merch that came with the purchase.

Since I did not have any app to scroll through last night, I started a book that I really enjoyed. Today, I woke up feeling refreshed and grounded again. 

Ultimately, it was the negative online interaction--the bullying and harassment--on the platform that jolted me back to reality. Not only do I need to stay away from that wretched app forever, but I should probably reduce my YouTube and Reddit usage. I'll make this a goal starting from today. I need to spend more time reading, practicing the piano, and definitely exercising (I find it so hard to drag myself to the gym in my apartment, but I'll try!!!)

When I was tired, hungry, drunk, hungover, broke, I was always welcome to sit down to an All Star Breakfast with bottomless coffee and conversation. Went to a state college that had a shining beacon of hope ran by college students who served college students. Had a hot meal through the “Snowpocalypse” that devastated most of northern Georgia years ago when all the food on campus was picked clean and no staff able to make it in. Had an All Star Breakfast when floods tore through my neighborhood and I was without power for days. Had vague memories of drunk college buddies half naked eating a triple order of hash browns flirting with the waitress. Had a place to sit down when my Uber driver got arrested when I was on my way to a party, stranded on the side of the road carrying a 30 pack barely 21. Whenever I was called to my manufacturing plant at 2am to respond to machine downtime, I had a booth to take me in and serve me my comfort food after little sleep and mind shot from troubleshooting automated equipment.

To all of you who have helped me over the years by showing up at all hours of the day no matter what, it may not mean much to you but it has meant the world to me. Please never change Waffle House.

1hhlqig,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hhlqig/am_i_the_problem/,Am I the problem? ,"M 28, came to realize that I have an emotionally immature mother around college when I stopped coming home and she did everything in her power to get me to come home such as making weekly random doctors appoints that I “had” to attend - until I just stopped. 

Lived on my own for 7 years after college in NYC, but moved home because i’m changing careers and attending a 70 K nursing school in about a year so I want to save.


My mom’s a pretty vicious person - nasty as all hell at times (refer to her as a pitbul because once her rage starts there’s zero stopping it). She loves confrontation - store managers, family members, neighbors. Any situation where she can make herself the victim and use that as a means to say and do the most vile shit you’ve ever heard she JUMPS at it. She has trauma - her mother was an awful alcoholic, and so is my father always sneaking vodka. As a kid she’d slap, punch, kick us as punishment for talking back as we got older and started having different thoughts to her. Instead of bowing at her feet in respect, back talk was oddly common because bets were off when it came to arguments it was like a violent street fight so maybe it was a no respect lost for one another situation. All my siblings would lash out in defense. Because it’s all we witnessed - nasty explosive fights. 

Fast forward to now, I’m living in their finished basement as I have to save for school and my first home. But she uses this as a means to control me as I’m “never doing my job” and am a freeloading pig (her words). I work 60+ hours a week at a job that’s 2.5 hrs away (one way) and I make 6 figures, I take classes at night (which I’m getting all A’s in) and my fatal flaw is I’m not as neat as my mom would like. I’m not dirty, but in my being home for less than an hour of passing out the room does get into a bit of disarray from time to time. But she uses this as an excuse to unleash her rages. Say the worst things imaginable to me, tell me I’m never doing my end of the bargain (which idk what that means). I’ve begged her to try therapy because she’s always so angry and she mocks me “well it doesn’t do any help to you”. She can’t take any criticism in the slightest way and explodes ready for war if I ask her to talk about it. And when I say it’s sad that our relationships been a mine field she tells me it’s all my fault on how I treat her. 

It’s not just the room though, anything that can somehow be twisted in her mind that I do (not getting her something when I go get a coffee, basically anything) that I’m the worst child on earth. She shit talks me to my dad loud enough so I can hear it, and has zero remorse for the things she says and acts confused when I still feel hurt about them the next day when she’s got her full of rage and finally wants to relax. She genuinely gets upset that I don’t seek her out to have conversations with her during the day (and says that I’m a self absorbed fuck for it) even then every interaction is so fucking negative. But if I distance myself I’m a POS free loader. 

My sisters considering cutting her off because she uses daycare (that my mother offered to do) over my sisters head like a privilege ripe for the taking if she doesn’t act right - knowing my sister is struggling to afford it. Between saving for this massive expense I can’t justify paying rent and am just struggling. Would love some help. 

Sometimes it feels like she sees our relationship as a friendship that has to be 50/50 in all things. To an extent that’s totally fair. But fuck I just sometimes need a mom that’s willing to go the extra mile for me and not use it as a bargaining chip, but simply because it makes her feel good to make her kids life just a tad easier. Maybe that makes me spoiled idk. 

Thanks.

Mugshot - get rewarded from drinking coffee out of sustainable cups (at coffee shops or at home)

Greencart - get rewarded for sustainable shopping and buying organic.

EVEarn - get rewarded for charging your Tesla.

ST3PR - get rewarded for walking steps (synced using Withings with your mobile Health app)

Cleanify - get rewarded for picking up trash. 

More apps to come (goal of 100 by end of 2025).

If you aren’t scared of crypto, it’s a good way to earn something by doing very little. And all for a better cause.

I also became annoyed at myself because I didn’t look away. It’s like I was frozen, seeing him - he was very fit and attractive, and he looked so confident and raw in and out of the water. My body responded to what I was seeing which made me feel very conflicted. 

I still haven’t told my husband about this. Nobody knows, except Reddit, now. I am feeling some guilt around this, both that I’ve kept it secret and that I must have liked it on some level. ",3,1734584989.0,offmychest,4,0.8,False

Definitely not a regular, had extra cream. 

Was taking a left onto the Revere Beach Parkway from from Chelsea/Everett. Guy was in the left turn lane and held everyone up trying to get back into the center lane. Car in front of me, myself and the car behind me gave some very gentle, not aggressive*, honks to get him to move up and out of the way. Apparently I was either just the easiest target or was jealous of my car. Or maybe he just knew it was finally my time to fully embrace being a North Shore Masshole.

I can't wait to now be able to baptize other fellow drivers into full Masshole-dom. 

*Maybe a little aggressive.

If you didn't see the OP you can find it here: It took nearly 40 years, but [it finally happened. A fellow Masshole baptized me with a Dunks coffee spiked off my windshield this morning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/s/Y6moEVcsVP)

I remember it like was yesterday. This wonderfully, beautifully, angry man in a small blue Toyota Yaris took exception to multiple cars honking at him for blocking a left turn lane and decided I would be the beneficiary of his glorious rage.

I obviously never expected to see him again, what would be the chances?
This happened as you may recall, crossing from Everett into Chelsea, as I was heading to work in East Boston. A key detail is I street park often on a street which is very much not gentrified and very much long-time EB residents. A few days after the baptism I saw a small, blue Toyota Yaris parked on the same block and had a little chuckle to myself... what if? But no way. Right?

I've it seen a few more times over the past weeks, and each time the details have stuck out a little more. The creative body tape work holding on the front bumper, the other dings and dents, the stickers.... what if? But still, no way right?

But today, I saw him. I came back from lunch and pulled up to park and saw him with his driver's side window down talking to another resident. It was him. All that was missing was him screaming what I am sure were the most gloriously offensive insults at me the morning of the baptism.

My question is, what do I do now? I would love to thank him for welcoming me into the Fellowship of the Masshole and granting me now the right to baptize the next acolyte but I bet he doesn't even remember me. I feel like it would be awkward to just approach him? Do I write him a letter? If so I think I have a pretty good [template to follow here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_6cEOk7x4HA) with some obvious tweaks.

I think the best play is that I maybe just leave a Dunks gift card on his windshield next time I see it? I feel like he would know who it was from.

Thoughts? Suggestions?

[Any machine|Any grinder],"I had a Philips/Saeco super automatic for over 10 years, and from time to time, I noticed a funny aftertaste. I thought it was some water sitting in the brew group or maybe the tubes, and running a blank shot (pouring a shot using the bypass but not adding any coffee) would help. Some people call this ""burning"" a shot.

Recently, the machine broke down and I decided on the Flair 58+, to get more control and make better tasting 'spros. This machine is as simple as you can get. No boiler. No tubes. No brew group. Just a chamber where you pour water, and a plunger to press the water though your portafilter.

That funny taste came back! The espresso are way better, but that taste (it's a subtle aftertaste) would ruin it for me. I thought maybe it's certain beans, or how they are stored, but I finally figured it out. It happened to be the lubricant. It was far more pronounced right after cleaning and lubricating the Flair for the first time, but this let me eliminate all other variables.

Do you use any specific lubricant to minimize impact to the flavour? One that doesn't damage the O-rings?

I am thinking of trying vegetable or olive oil next time, but I'm thinking they could mess with the rubber O-rings.",2,1734584588.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

But it never takes long. You’re there in the quiet, a ghost of routine—your voice in the hum of the fridge, your touch in the creak of the floorboards you once teased me about.

For years, you surrounded me. You were a constellation in my life, something I built my orbit around. My furniture held the weight of you, my clothes carried the scent of you, even the spaces you didn’t touch felt touched by you somehow.

Now there is this silence. Unbelievable, heavy, endless. I thought peace would feel softer, like a blanket wrapped around me, but instead, it’s like standing in the vacuum of space. There’s no air here. No sound. Is this peace? Or is it just the boredom of a life stripped bare, without your chaos to color it?

I miss you. In ways I cannot say without unraveling. I miss the mornings when the sunlight wasn’t lonely, when it fell over two cups of coffee and the way you would linger at the window, lost in thought. I miss the versions of myself I could be when you were in the room—some of them messy, yes, but still, they were versions I loved for being loved by you.

But I know where we stand now. I know we’ve placed the last stone on this path and walked away in opposite directions. Even so, I keep looking back over my shoulder. I wonder if you do too.

The mornings stretch out like this, full of light and silence and memories. And I wonder, is this what it means to be at peace? Or is it simply the ache that comes with surviving your love?",2,1734584574.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,0,1.0,False

-wrapped a gift. 

Then day 4 took my first bath (don’t worry, didn’t submerge anything, had it wrapped just like if I was in the shower) which caused me so much pain…

The last few days I’ve been listening to my body, so if I try to do something like write or open a package and it starts to hurt I get help.

I’m not sure what’s worse, letting the pain happen and then taking the meds, or taking the meds before I do something that I know will hurt….

If I’m in pain I take breaks for hours at a time as well. I’ve been on my phone (always resting elbow on a pillow), or to take a break from holding it I will watch TV for a bit. I have a tiny keyboard I keep in my lap to use with my iPad to mix it up.

I no longer feel the need to elevate my arm.

Was told to “try to use your hand/arm as much as you can to sustain mobility” and “don’t lift anything heavier than a coffee mug”. It seems like this advice is giving me too much pain to function without needing Percocet.

1hhla3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/arizonasunshine/comments/1hhla3g/az_sunshine_lore/,AZ sunshine lore?,"First off, spoiler warning for anyone who hasn’t yet played Arizona Sunshine, Arizona Sunshine 2 or the DLCs

I just wanna get my head on straight and kinda figure out what the deal is with our star of the game, his life and everything going on. I just wanna put what I know down and get some insight from anyone else.

To start off, the protagonist’s name can kinda be found in the first game (I will be using information gathered from the remake instead of the og game) and you can find it at the very very start in a little lockbox. There’s a notice letter written to Mr T, the rest of his name is coincidentally hidden under a coffee stain, and this letter is found under a gold bar and literal hundreds of dollars.
In some dialogue in the sequel, around the airport, if you pick up a construction helmet and when you reach the quarantine wall. Mr T mentions that he and a few friends of his worked in construction and his friends even helped build the massive wall which he states “did jack shit”. So we know he has experience with construction, specifically roof work as he mentions to Buddy the dog upon inspecting a hardhat.
Now, he does state that his sister had cancer, you can hear this when picking up pill bottles in the second game as he states that they are similar or the exact type of pills his sister took while undergoing treatment and mentions how unbelievably expensive they were. 
Your first time in the sewers you can come across a prisoner’s slipper and Mr T mentions he did time for fraud and theft of charitable funds. I firmly believe this money he stole was form his sister as a newspaper you can find in the first game has the headline: “Local man steals money from sister’s cancer treatment” or something similar and then he was caught and served time, a result of this was his family resenting and hating him.
I like to believe that Mr T was a heavy drinker and kind of a scumbag, he never paid rent on time or did any kind of taxes which resulted in him needing money either for financial reasons or to pay for his addiction. It is not stated if Mr T ever served in the military but I like to believe he did and was dishonorably discharged or at least has hunting experience since he can handle firearms without any problems, including the mini guns you use in the sequel. (As someone born in AZ, it wouldn’t surprise me if he’s an expert in hunting or general shooting cause that’s all we have for entertainment)

Now, I’m not gonna sit here and recap the whole story of both games, it’s pretty laid out in terms of what the hell is going on but I will touch on the dlcs and my take on them

Starting with Deadman, you take on the task of launching a nuke to wipe out the freddies that overtook the state (maybe the whole world) and it ends with you reaching the refinery from the first game and being shot as you turn into a zombie, and then the Damned is about trying to get power on at the Hoover Dam (it’s called sth else but idc) and after you successfully do so, you’re flushed out into the water and left for dead because your captain is a grade a asshole. The MC of the damned mentions the refinery in the game and Deadman shows that it’s controlled by human military forces so I assume they take place around the same time if not back to back but my main theory is they take place BEFORE the main game and the nuke failed to land or something because when Mr T finds it, it’s overrun and there’s no humans, then the sequel shows Arizona to be just fine, no signs of explosion or nuclear detonation so it can’t be after the base game or maybe it is, I don’t recall them mentioning it and the devs made sure of not including a very strong timeline for the story but I assume we’re meant to piece it together.
Finally, I think the game takes place in Northern Arizona, more towards the Grand Canyon and the Hoover dam than anywhere else but it has the super stereotypical orange/red vibes that the west gets in media rather than the more green side of Northern AZ that Ive seen so it’s a cool little blend

This definitely wasn’t meant to be some kind of “I figured it all out” post, and I’m not really asking any questions, I just wanted to lay down what I have discovered so far after starting to replay the sequel and kinda inching my way through the secrets. Only question I have is if anyone who knows more could point out any flaws or give more information, I’d love to hear more about these games cause I love Arizona representation in games and these two definitely take the cake, so definitely give me your takes on Mr T as a character, where in AZ the game might take place and other cools things.

# On the roads of St. Augustine, Florida, Terra

The antique reproduction Indian motorcycle roared beneath Senator Malik Sabr as he expertly navigated the picturesque reproduction of the bay-front district.  Unlike most antique motorcycles, Senator Sabr's was an exceedingly rare example produced before the colonization of Mars which survived the intervening decades intact.  To him, the fact that it had survived so much and continued to serve was emblematic of Terra and all she'd produced.  Just so, he'd always appreciated the efforts various cities across Terra made to revive their beautiful places despite what must have been tremendous difficulty.  As a history buff, he was more aware of most that much of the scenery that looked thousands of years old only dated back to shortly after the Declaration of Sovereignty.  Still, it was no small pleasure as he turnned to ride his motorbike over the Pluto Compact Memorial Bridge to see the pleasure craft bobbing in their slips or tooling across the sparkling water in the marina through its transparent surface.  It was a decidedly peaceful scene.  Less pleasurable was the crowd gathered around the entrance to his destination, The Hall of the Fallen.

Rather, it was two crowds.  Where there should have been maybe a dozen or so people entering or leaving the memorial's columned entrance by way of the broad, shallow stairs rising from the road to the Classical hall jutting out over the waves in somber repose, there were people shouting at one another.  The dueling discordant chants rising from the opposing groups rather spoiled the mood of the memorial.  It was tense, almost on the verge of violence.  Whether from one side which had adopted variants of ""No Terran blood for xenos soil,"" or the other calling for the total extermination of the Axxaakk in disunified chants to that effect.  Both sides waved placards and had flags whos handles looked suspiciously like they were intended for clubs, and more than one taunt bubbled up over the chants.  In fact, if it wasn't for the two lines of hard eyed, hard bodied police officers separating the groups with quiet authority, they might have come to blows already.  Thankfully, the police had kept a narrow corridor up the steps clear.  Senator Sabr didn't fear for his safety, even as the pro-extermination faction spat threats and insults at him as he walked by.  He knew the look of the kind of fury that only comes from someone who's never seen combat when he saw it.

Once he'd passed by the stone columns, the protesters became muted, as if there was a solid wall between him and them, though he knew there was no such thing.  He had never thought of it before, but the place must have some way to dampen outside sound built in.  He breathed a sigh of relief and shrugged a little tension out from his shoulders beneath his riding jacket with the creak of well-worn leather and let the somber reflective mood of the place wash over him.  Hidden lights cast a golden glow across the whole of the cavernous stone hall, and made the walkways between the standing slabs of marble look somewhat imposing with their understated implications.  He took another deep breath, and plunged in directly in the middle. 

The slabs stretched up a good five feet above his head, and were inscribed from top to bottom, and across their entire six feet in length with the names of those who fell in service to The Republic, and where one slab ended, a gap of only four feet separated it from where the next began.  It was a weighty place.

He found his quarry midway down the hall, where the slabs ahead were blank, waiting in mute vigil for the names to be added to those behind.  In fact, one such name was being added as Senator Ethan Robert watched with shoulders slumped and eyes glazed.  A pair of sharply dressed workers maneuvered a large box containing inscrutable carving devises to properly align the new name, and used heavy duty suction cups to fix it in place before activating it.  The device hummed quietly as it did its work, and Senator Sabr's friend watched.  It went quiet, and the workers broke the seals, set the device on the floor, dusted off the newly carved name, and began the process again directly below the new name.

""We were supposed to meet for drinks two hours ago, Ethan,"" Senator Sabr said in a near whisper.

Senator Robert tore his eyes away from the somber and understated work with obvious difficulty and sighed, ""Sorry.  I didn't think it was a good idea for me to drink.""

""Coffee?""

Senator Robert blinked as if seeing Senator Sabr for the first time, ""Oh, Malik.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Everybody's been trying different things to cheer me up since…""

""Are you upset about glassing an enemy world, or their retaliation?""

""We don't actually know, Malik, we don't know how deep their reserves are.  What if our counter invasion barely scratches the surface of their territory?""

""Does that change what needs to be done?""

""Maybe.""

The workers dusted off another new name.

""You were right, by the way.""  Senator Sabr was treated to the deeply amusing sight of his friend turning and raising a sardonic eyebrow as he explained, ""Total War was inevitable with the Dominion of Axxaakk.  I was mistaken to think we could slap them hard enough to sue for terms, and they will need to be defeated utterly before they'll be willing to deal with us in any way other than on the battlefield.""

Senator Robert snorted, ""That's if we can defeat them.""

""Historically, the Republic has faced worse threats.""

""Such as?""

The machine hummed, filling the silence between the two friends.

""The Ants-But-Worse, they represented an existential threat.  A wave of all consuming giant insects unable or unwilling to communicate in any way.  The grubs of course, but you'll say they were nipped in the bud, and you'll be right.""

""I participated in the evacuation of three planets durring the grub extermination, you know.  And what came next.  Sure, we stopped the threat cold before it got very far into either the Republic or CIP, but it cost billions of lives.""

""Don't forget, I was RNI durring the invasion and the extermination.  Six Terran worlds glassed, and I don't even like to think about how many xenos worlds we turnned into the Glassed Gulf.  Had to be done though, you saw what happened if even one of those things egg sacs survived.""

Senator Robert shuddered and said, ""Yeah.  We end up making the Lost Boys.""

""Going back further, the worst war since the Corporate War, didn't you learn about the Alliance War?""

""I don't remember much, just that it's why the CIPpies never do more than shake their fists at us.""

The workers aligned the carving device once more.

""In terms of moral depravity, I'd say that the Tiānhé zhī Dùn was close to the Dominion, worse, since they were Terrans abusing fellow Terrans.  Slavery, mass starvation, brainwashing, mass killings, rampant sexual abuse.  The works. All of that, and they thought that every Terran should be under their rule.""

""We knew their measure though.  We knew what they could do, and how to beat them, so we did.""

""So we did, and so we will.""

""How many more names here will it cost?""

""How many will be forgotten forever if we refuse the bill?""

Senator Robert's eyes harden, his spine stiffened, and his eyes cleared, ""I shouldn't be here whining about how bad it feels to tell these men what is required.  Not when they volunteer without complaining.  Not when they go and do the real work.""

The workers started up the machine with a quiet hum once more.  It seemed to Senator Sabr that they too had more resolve in their shoulders than when he had first seen them.  He and his friend watched them work for a while longer.  They didn't need to say anything more.

# Aboard the Speaking Softly

Yoivedrill sat on the sofa of the Drillvee family's quarters with Mayvee curled up in his lap squeezing him about his middle with all four of her arms as if he might disappear if she let go, and Laivee huddled up against herself in the corner made by the opposite armrest.  He sighed and gently ran a hand over his youngest sister's head and softly said, ""It's not like I'm disembarking today.""

""But you're talking about leaving our ships for the Republic's.""

""Grandpa served in the Republic, they even have statues of him.""

""That's not the same, and you know it.  Grandpa did SAR work in a tug, what you're talking about is… it's.. It's crazy.  You said you were gonna join the *Naval Infantry,* and they *fight people.*""

Yoivedrill grunted as Mayvee squeezed him harder and he grunted, ""What do you think Uncle Brix is doing, Lai?""

""Fighting, but that's different.""

""How?""

Laivee slivered and hugged her knees tighter and explained, ""Because *Among the Star Tides We Rage* is one of our ships.""

""So was the *Mister Smee,* and she had Uncle Rodger on her.""

The younger girl flinched as if her older brother had slapped her and she mumbled, ""But he was a Terran on a Terran ship…""

""He was *our* family.""

Tears shone in Laivee's eyes as she mumbled, ""I know.  May his soul sail home, and his murdered ship's name find a new hull.""

""So why are you mad at me for wanting to do my part?""

""Why can't you just join a Justiciar or a Dreadnaught?  The fleet is split, all of the Star Sailors are at war already, and you won't have to,"" Laivee shook her head as if to dispel tears before continuing, ""have to fight the bad guys on a planet with no ship to protect you.  And their fleets are always split.  You'll be on a ship with no fathers, no mothers, no sons, no daughters.  Only brothers and sisters because everyone else got sent away, just like when we split the Fleets.""

Yoivedrill sat silent for a good minute or two before explaining, ""It's because of the Honor Guard.  They faught for us and the *We Sing* in the bad guy's own ships and if it wasn't for them, we would have never got away.  The bad guys still killed her, but we got away, you May, Mom and me, and one day we'll Commission *Among the Star Tides We Sing* again, and we'll make that true again.  But first, I owe a debt to the RNI.""

While her brother was speaking, Laivee scooched closer and by the time he was done explaining himself, she was leaned up against him and she whispered mournfully, ""Honor for honor.""

""Don't worry, I can't join until next year.  I'm not going anywhere until then.""  Yoivedrill could feel Mayvee's tears soaking through his shirt.  He pretended not to notice.

Far from the Drillvee family quarters, Traevee found herself embroiled in her duty as an ambassidor of the Fleets.  The Republic of Terra together with the CIP and Roma Nova had halted the Axxaakk advance, yet not without great cost.  The capitol world of the Kingdom of Jacuvia was in flames, and the Star Council had themselves lost a staggering fifteen planets.  That wasn't even to mention the strikes to Terran territory suffered.  Unfortunately, the Dominion of Axxaakk had recently fielded ships able to actually engage Terran cruisers and win.  This made securing the flank more than a little important.  To that end, Ambassador Sophia Laurent had arranged to visit the Draconian Empire.

The meeting hadn't gotten very far, the introduction of Third Princess Lac'xah, and her statement of her government's official position of local fortification. Traevee was looking at the cleverly disguised screen at the view of the capitol city of the Draconian Empire as she waited for the trouble to begin.  It didn't take long, Li Wei was explaining, ""While Pacifia cannot provide you with weapons, we have extensive experience in logistics and can produce the materials you require.""

""Silence barbarian,"" Third Princess Lac'xah snapped and turnned her narrow snout away from all three present Terran ambassadors.

Traevee turnned and regarded the four legged, two armed, jewel encrusted, reptilian princess and said, ""You ought not insult a host on their own ship, Princess, it is considered very rude.""

""I have not offered insult, the barbarian was making useless noise, Sailor.""

""Keep calling us barbarians, and we'll send you back to your palace without a shuttle,"" Ambassador Laurent said primly as she delicately sipped at some hot coffee.  Once again, Traevee was deeply jealous of the Terran ability to metabolize so much caffeine, and for it to be a stimulant rather than a relaxant.  ""Because that's what we'd consider barbaric behavior.""

""I have stated the policy of the Empress, I see no need for further discussion.""

""Unfortunately, you're at the rear flank of the Star Counsel,"" Ambassador Volkov explained, ""there's a chance the Assbags could surge through the Glassed Gulf to attack you from rimward and thus cut the Star Counsel off from the rest of the alliance.""

Third Princess Lac'xah tilted her head and examined the star map of the area in question before saying, ""We are less prepared for an attack from that direction.  But, wouldn't such an attacking force risk envelopment?""

""It depends,"" Traevee said, ""As formidable as the Republicans are, they cannot be everywhere at once, and if the enemy concetrates sufficient forces to such a flanking manuver, they may be forced to pull forces from the front line in the Kingdom of Jecauvia, the Star Council, and the various Terran frontier areas. ""

""This would increase the cost of our victory,"" Ambassador Laurent said softly.  Softly like the whisper of a dagger across a whetstone.  ""An increase in costs in terms of lost Republican servicemen and innocent civilians, and the Republic of Terra will have an accounting of all such costs.""

""The Fleets could not sail stars which are held by those unwilling to hold them against a would-be conqueror, nor would we suffer to have a supposed ally contribute nothing while we kill and dy to keep the war far from them, Traevee said somberly.

Third Princess Lac'xah seemed to calculate for a moment before she said, ""What further action do you recommend?""

""First of all, we need to free up more of our forces for the offensive.  You don't win wars by defense, after all.""

From there it was a discussion of how, when, and where forces would be committed.

# Upon the surface of the forge world Exznuvva

Weeks, it had been weeks since this allegedly habitable hellhole had been liberated by the Republican Army, and Pip and his people were still there.  Pip had served as a lieson between his own military and the RNI, but apparently the Republican Navy is very different from its Army, even its infantry element.

They had come rolling out of the beachheads established by the RNI like a single inexorable wave until every last military instillation, warrior, officer, and aristocrat had been destroyed, made casualties or captured.  It was a terrifying display.  Tanks, infantry in power armor, jets and helicopters overhead worked in perfect concert, or what seemed like it at the time.  Pip had seen enough mangled suits of power armor and burned out husks to know that the victory came at a cost, and Terrans were the types to think that one life was a steep cost.  They were also the type to not count the cost until it was already paid, and for that he was grateful.

Still, progress off of this ancestorless rock was painfully slow.  The Army had managed to gather up the Lutrae from across the planet into a single refugee camp, and were working on making sure that everyone was accounted for.  Pip tried to remember that he didn't want anyone left behind either, but he hated this place.  At least they got proper fish to eat and didn't have to rely on CRAYONS.  Plus, the Terrans were trying to make their accommodations at least not miserable even when they fell short of comfortable. 

So, it was in this spirit that he approached a soldier in power armor, probably a Human man from the lack of a tail and its general shape and size.  ""Any word on a transport, Corporal?""

""How the fuck did you learn RBC?""

""Fuckin' learned when I served with you.  You got an answer or just a thumb up your ass?""

""Fuck me sideways, I fuckin' wish.  Word 'round E-4 country is maybe next week if we can figure out where the missing thirty of your people went.""

""We're down to just thirty missing?""

""No shit.  Found like two hundred of you dudes, kids too, in some flooded tunnels yesterday.  Apparently they'd scrammed when the planet started shaking and the slavers stopped paying attention.""

There was a lump in Pip's throat as he said, ""Fuckin' A.""

""Fuckin' A,"" the corporal agreed.

""I could probably round up some volunteers for search parties to search those flooded tunnels.""

The corporal shook his helmeted head and explained, ""Not unless we can get Lutrae pattern power armor out here or printed up quick enough.  Them tunnels were sewers.  Your people got a new wing added to the field hospital, they were in worse than rough shape.""

""Ancestors,"" Pip swore.

The corporal grunted his agreement and looked at the display of a datapad in his hand before saying, ""These fuckers, they recorded your people as numbers.  Fucking numbers and nothing else.  They didn't even have the fucking decency to add a note, adult male, juvenile female, infant male.  We have to figure out how their fucking numbers work.""  The plastic of the datapad started to flex as he continued to speak, ""and they don't even fucking bother to record when they murdered one of you.  They just fucking changed your number and that's fucking it,"" the datapad began to crack.  ""What's got me right now is I figured out how to recognize the code for kids.  That last thirty, all kids.""

""Ancestors,"" Pip swore again.

The datapad snapped in the soldier's hand and he said, ""Yeah.  God or your ancestors or fucking Satan damn these fucks.  Damn them forever.""

Pip got the feeling that the corporal was done talking so he offered an agreeable grunt by way of agreement and scampered off to find someone else to ask about the other thing he was interested in knowing.  In the lee of a shattered building where the rubble formed a hollow, he found the perfect opportunity, a poker game.  Present were thee privates first class, a corporal, and a specialist, and most importantly, their helmets were off.  The privates were all Human men each a different skin and hair color.  Humans had so much variety.  The two E-4s present were a Doggo and Bigkitty, and their expressive ears made for terrible poker faces in Pip's experience, but that didn't seem to be helping the privates.  Odd.

""What's the buy in,"" Pip asked as he reached into his jumpsuit's pocket for the only thing it could be.

""Pack of cigs, but you dudes- oh,"" the Specialist began as the package thudded on the table.

""I like poker, I'm Pip.""

""Mark,"" the corporal grunted.

""Ira,"" the specialist added.

""Brian,"" one of the privates said and was quickly followed by his fellows.

""Steve.""

""Orion."" 

""Texas hold 'em.""

Pip nodded and pulled up a piece of rubble as the Terrans counted out some pebbles to serve as chips for him and Orion shuffled the cards.

""I don't see why we don't just put a bullet through anything with bones poking out its knuckles,"" Steve said, evidently resuming the conversation.

""Pluto Compact,"" Ira replied simply and tossed a couple of pebbles into the pot for the ante.

Steve anted up and mused, ""I don't recall the axebat dophin signing the Pluto Compact.""

""So we should become just like them?"" Orion asked, ""Want to build a couple of alters to Khorne or some shit?""

""Knorne is fucking dumb.  Raaa I like killing, I'm the god of killing.  Gimme skulls,"" Brian said teasingly.

""Shut the fuck up, you run orks,"" Steve scoffed.  ""I just don't figure why we bother saving slaving, kid killing scum.  They're bound to get to Strike Two at best.""

""Even the kids born as aristocrats who haven't hurt anybody?"" Pip asked quietly as he called.

Orion showed the first three cards, and Pip found himself with two pair, tens and twos.  The private looked at the cards and agreed quietly, ""Adult Axxaakk come from somewhere.  The enslaved ones, the fighting ones, and the ones giving orders.""

""That doesn't excuse the depraved shit those fucks do,"" Brian muttered darkly.

""So your solution is just shoot the lot?"" Pip asked.

""Not mine.  I don't know what should be done, but that's a job for the politicians.  I'm just a grunt with a gun,"" Brian answered as he raised.

""You know about the slave instructors?""

Every Terran around the pot narrowed their eyes, and Ira said, ""Mixed fucking bag there.  Some of them were downright cruel to your folks.""

""Some were workmanlike,"" Orion said as he called.

""Ours protected us.""

That was met with wide eyed silence.

""Of course, he did it within his limits, and it was mostly advice on how to avoid punishment, but he stuck his neck out for us anyway.  Plus, he helped the Advance Drop Scout with some info.""

""Do you know his numbers?""

""Serf Instructor twelve, thirty-two, oh thirty-four twelve.""

""Lanky guy?  Nervous eyes?""

""Yeah, we called him Twelves.""

""Fuck,"" Ira said.

""What?""

""One of the other POWs stabbed him yesterday, he was seen cooperating.  He's laid up in the field hospital,"" she explained.

""Any chance you could get me in for a visit?""

""We'll see what we can make happen,"" Mark grunted.

Pip let the subject pass and focused on taking away his new comrades' cigarettes away.

DIY quick and cheap:

Dye some old curtains or towels and embroider or iron on a new detail to make them unique. Can do this with old sweatshirts and the like as well. Just be sure to wash them prior to giving so they don't bleed dye into their wash!

Paint an old glass or mug you have and fill with dirt and a sprout or trimming from your favorite plant. (LPT - if you have a spider plant, cut a bit of growth off and put it in the glass of water with whatever you're trying to root, it will significantly improve your success rate)

Have an old mirror or tray? Paint it, or print some meaningful pictures and line the bottom with resin. Or turn it into a photo box! Use dried herbs, flowers, stickers. Whatever you have on hand.

Bake! Even with box mix. Sub sprite for eggs, milk and butter for vegan versions. Sub coffee for water to make chocolate cake mix richer. Add toppings to make it extra tasty. Use cookies as bottoms to cupcakes. Eta put chocolate kisses in on top of the cookies as a base for cupcakes, adds a flavorful twist and makes the mix go further.

Can make a princess privacy netting with some cheap colored tulle and some wire hangers. Use a bucket or trash bin to shape the wire hangers into a circle. Make curtains with the tulle to create a flowing mosquito net and string around the circle of wire. Add strings of feathers or beads. Can be hung from the ceiling or suspended from a curtain rod.

I stare down at the script resting on the seat of the chair in front of me, written by my lover. I hate to admit it looks pretty good despite my lack of input. It feels weird having my arms tied out in front of me to a chair's arms that I'm kneeling nude  front of. But it's one of Nora's favorite ways to restrain slaves, even when she's not around. She's even done it to Sarah, her favorite a couple of times.

Speaking of Sarah, I start as Slave Bubblebutt and I's Alpha Slave slaps her crop over the script, hollering ""Slave Zero! I can tell when you're daydreaming and not reading. We have a schedule to keep, Slave! You want to be petty about not getting any input sometimes, but you don't read the scripts when we set aside time for you to do just that! Read, young lady, I'm quizzing you on it! Every wrong answer is a stripe on your ass!"" 

I start to mmmph ""Yes, Alpha Sarah."" The top Slave for our session just says ""Pffft, shut up, numbskull. You seriously picked the wrong day to piss me off. Read, bitch!!""

I hold back an angry harrumph at my normally sweet Asian bestie's obvious bad mood. She's right, in our current respective positions, I don't want to piss off the normally calm exotic girl today. I try to focus on the script.

Slave Bubblebutt to my right tenatively mmmphs ""ulpa ara, tun da paye, weese?"" Alpha Sarah, turn the page, please? ""Certainly,  sweetie, would you like some water, too?"" Her voice is bright and chirpy now, no trace of her anger at me directed at the Thicc Milf. It pisses me off how patient and respectful she is to a stranger, even a slave. But me her best friend...on the other hand I should have known it was the wrong day to test her, not like Bubblebutt could've.

Bubblebutt mmmphs ""es Misswess Ara, no wawaa et."" I hear Sarah gently turn the page. ""Don't be frightened of me, sweetie. If you're a respectful slave, I'm a respectful Alpha. I apologize for Zero modeling bad behavior for you, she knows better. She will be a much better behaved slave from now on, I promise you."" I feel her scrutiny on me as she talks to Slave Bubblebutt. I want to turn and mmmph snark at her around the nerfball zippered in my mouth. I know today is not the day. I try to focus on Mistress Lara's script.


Captain's Log (Commander Gail's Voice over a screen of stars)

An Amazonian throne ship, an Amazonian troop ship, and a å N'Docc Regiment operating from an uninhabited, neutral system has seized a passing starliner. They're far from Alliance lines, but far from ours, as well. The Compact started approving routes deep in Neutral Space to prevent this sort of thing. Somehow the Alliance has gotten one up on us, again. A Princess Machit proclaims she is in charge, and will only negotiate with the Compact's greatest female warrior. Unfortunately, they consider that me, Commander Dora Gail of the SCS Perseverance.

It's almost certainly a trap to capture and enslave me, maybe the rest of the Perseverance crew, and claim the ship as their prize. The Brass was seriously considering sacrificing the hostages to prevent that. I told them the only way I'm not going is if they relieve and Court Martial me. Some of them seemed tempted to do just that. In the end Admiral Mendez fought for and recieved orders for me to go, with her usual admonition to be careful. I will, I don't want to die a Whipping Girl like Captain Rommie. But I'm not letting innocent people die because of a bounty on my ass. Into the breech.

Perseverance Bridge

(The Watch entering the Janus System, where the hostages are held, is tense. Dora Gail is seated in her Captain's chair looking tense as she scrolls through the intelligence on Princess Machit and her Military Detachment. ASSHO is unflappable studying the data on her XO's Master Status Console. Rachael Willis at the helm. Lt..Commander Kang Beom Seok at the Science Station. Saarya is seated to Gail's left, ready to offer the unique insight only a former Alliance slave could have about their enemies. Entering a system with a hostile force holding hostages, an enemy force of uncertain strength, Gail is bringing her A game to the Bridge watch, not just her Senior Officers but all around best people for the job. Nothing else will do in this situation.)

Kang: We're passing the outer planet and it's two moons. We're being tracked by two automated defense stations on each moon, with antimatter powered particle beams as the only weapons that have the range to reach us. With the recalibrations we made to the sheilds, we should be alright if a couple of shots hit us, if we get out of range before all four can launch a steady barrage on us.

ASSHO: (Peering at her Master Status Display) Lt. Commander Kang, I recommend a 4% recalibration for the ambient gamma radiation. There's an automated solar system drone hiding behind the class 3 comet at bearing  312 mark 71. It appears to be equipped with the Alliance equivalent of phased torpedos which can weaken our shields.

Kang: (looks flustered, turns to bark at his XO) Listen here, girl, I've pulled a 36 hour shift modifying  these sensors and I-(Realizes ASSHO is staring at him impassively, while Gail and the female bridge crew are glaring him down)

Kang: (Takes a deep breath, nods at Gail, ASSHO, and the rest of the bridge crew) Captain, XO, Ladies, please accept my humblest apologies for my outburst. I'm recalibrating for the ambient radiation as you recommended, XO. (He quickly turns back to his console, embarrased at his outburst)

(ASSHO is staring at him intently as he works) 

ASSHO:Lieutenant Commander, I'm doing my percieved duty to monitor ship crew and operations and make 
recommendations for greater efficiencey. Would you enlighten me as to what I did to offend you? (From most XO's this would be sarcastic, and they'd probably write Kang up for insubordination despite his apology. ASSHO is still learning how to be human. She really wants to know if she did something wrong) 

Kang (Turns his seat to face her) Nothing that you did, I'm tired and stressed, and reacted to your legitimate recommendation badly (When she nods to indicate she accepts that, he turns back to his station).

(Gail is watching this play out, and decides to address not just the bridge crew, but her entire crew)

Gail: Rachael, key the ships intercom for shipwide. 

(Lt. Willis adjusts the settings on her console)

Willis: Ready when you are, Captain.

Gail: (Clears her throat) All hands, this is the Captain. I'll give you a moment to pause what you're doing, if it's not critical.

(She pauses as Willis flys and navigates, Kang scans for and classifies threats, and ASSHO monitors all ship operations and information collected faster than a non modified human could)

Gail: This has been a stressful mission since we got this assignment, and I appreciate you're all under a great deal of strain. I've had Department Head meetings on how to mitigate this, I want you all to believe your senior Officers and NCO's are doing the best we can for you.

But this is a war, and we're a frontline warship. We're not just any frontline warship,  we're the Perseverance! Acorrding to Admiral Mendez and other Admirals, we're hands down one of the best ships in the fleet. I say we are The BEST ship in the fleet, with the best crew, but Ima little biased.

(Appreciative Chuckle from the Perseverance bridge crew)

The Alliance thinks to use our compassion and kindness to lure us into a trap. They think our values are a weakness that will allow them to win, eventually. They intend to take us and not free a single hostage, the Admiralty and I concur on that, if not much else, these days. Except maybe how awesome all of you are.

We will show them our weakness is a strength. We will try to negotiate in good faith, but when they show their true colors, we'll be prepared. We'll save the hostages and give them such a drubbing that the Alliance will never forget the name Perseverance. The Hostages are counting on us. Once again the Stellar Compact is counting on us. And I know with the best crew in the fleet, we won't let them down. Steady on, Perseverance, we've got this. All of you have got this! I'm proud to be the Captain of each and every one of you!.

(She signals to Willis to cut the feed, looks around at her Senior Officers)

Gail: How did I do, guys?

Willis (gives a thumbs up) You nailed it, Ma'am!

ASSHO: (In a flat voice but with a very small smile) I feel very inspired, Commander Gail.

Saarya: This is why the crew has so much faith in you, you treat respect as a two way street!

Kang: You have a remarkable way about you, young lady, I'd follow you to the gates of Hel.

(She takes a moment to enjoy the respect of her Senior Officers-and friends. Then her face turns serious.)

Gail: Steady on the Helm, Miss Willis. Send out a signal we're ready to parley when they are.

(Willis complies and looks suprised when the incoming message indicator starts blinking on her console almost immediately after her actions).

Willis: Incoming visual transmission!

Kang: A ship is moving out from behind a planetoid at bearing 315, Mark 60, 900,000 kilometers! The Quantum threat identifier tags it as an Amazonian throne ship!.

(Gail tries to maintain her calm as she gives orders. She may feel the same shock as her older, more experienced Officers, but it's undignified to show it as the ship's Commanding Officer)

Gail: Yellow Alert. Weapons tight, preplanned responses authorized to all stations for self defense. Put the transmission on screen. Into the breech, folks.

(Princess Machit appears on screen. She wears a more ornamented version of standard Amazonian Battle Leathers, Along with a jeweled tiara on her head. Two her left is a slender woman with nice C cup tits and a vibrant black bush, that's all that's visible of her, except her lovely hazel eyes, in the high tech slave suit covering her from head to toe (This is Slave Zero-Sheila Nguyen Connor).

To her right a shorter, thicker woman with big DD tits hanging out, and a more trimmed dark bush locked at attention in an Amazonian Slave rig (This is Slave Bubblebutt-Cindy Phu‌‌).

Gail: I'm Commander Gail Of the-

(Princess Machit waves her hand to cut Gail off)

Machit: I know who you are Commander Gail. The finest Warrior in your pathetic so called Compact, for a mere slip of a girl. You and your women prove our point, women can do anything better than men. This must be such a bittersweet achievement for you. Your Compact would have let you serve a few years in your pathetic Navy for some fanciful notion of equality. Then you'd be pregnant and serving some disgusting male, working a desk job or barefoot and pregnant as his domestic slave. Girl, this war is liberation for you and all the other women your chauvanist, male controlled Compact oppresses. One day you'll throw off their yoke completely and join us in creating a galactic matriarchy!

(Gail seethes at the  Alliance Propaganda, though some of it's lies have a grain of truth. She gets right to the point about freeing the hostages.

Mistress Nora, Alpha Slave Sarah, when Slave Zero reaches this point in the script, STOP! Indoctrinate her on the slavesuit and what's to be expected. Make it clear that Mistress Jasmine and Bubblebutt are in her chain of command as Domme and Alpha slave respectively. This is because a domme familiar with the suits needs to be able to veto the decisions of her regular dommes who aren't. And she needs to follow the lead of an Alpha Slave experienced with the suits, Cindy Phu, aka Bubblebutt.

I read the last paragraph after Sarah turned the script page for me. She waited patiently for me to read and for it to sink in.
I was a little suprised, but I got over the shock of it. I was new to the suits, it was a necessary safety precaution that Jasmine and Slave Bubblebutt had direct authority over me while I was in the Slave Suit, as they had the most experience with it from both ends. Still it was fucking humiliating to go from Chief Scriptwriter and Top Domme to lowest slave on a set I had come to think of as mine. Yeah, even with my consent.

""Sheila dear, this is not to humiliate you, but keep you safe, you know that, correct?"" I mmmphed ""Yep, Afa arqa."" She petted my latex covered head. ""My good girl! I knew you were smart enough to get it. We're going to go over the suit specs. But first I'm going to make clear how Bubblebutts authority over you works.""

""I'll ungag you both. You, Slave Zero do not have permission to speak unless spoken to by myself  or Slave Bubblebutt. She's not Slave Bubblebutt to you, though, she's Alpha Cindy. She will refer to you as Slave Zero. I know it's humiliating, but her authority over you must be firmly established over you for safety reasons.""
Sarah explained gravely as she unzipped my mouth, had me spit out the foam ball, then hydrated me with a bottle of water.

She moved to my right and did the same for Slave Bubble-Alpha Cindy- I might as well get used to addressing my new superior properly, I thought glumly.

Sarah told Slave Bubblebutt ""Alpha Cindy, please explain to Slave Zero your expectations for her as your Beta Slave when she's suited. I heard a really pleasant voice reply ""Thank you, Alpha Sarah. Slave Zero, can you hear and understand me?""

I hesitated, but Sarah had moved around behind me. I felt a warning tap on my bare butt from Sarah's crop. ""Yes Bubble Bu-"" I started to reply. Another warning tap from Sarah's crop. ""Yes, Alpha Cindy.""

""Good. Most of the time Mistress Jasmine will have one copy of your suit remote, and one of your dommes/Alpha slaves will have the other. We are then essentially equals, I don't think we'll get much chance to interact if it's not scripted.""

""But I will be overseeing some of your training and orientation sessions in the suit. Normally it will be Mistress Jasmine demonstrating to your superiors how to control you in the suit, what to check for to make sure you're safe and healthy, and basic maintenance and repairs on the suit. If there's a serious malfunction, there's a quick release procédure Mistress Jasmine will demonstrate to your Mistresses to get you out of the suit quickly and safely. Then tve suit has to be sent to à Service Center for repairs.""

""But I will have a say in your training, and sometimes I'll have custody of a remote. This is very important if we're left alone together, Slave Zero. You will obey me without question, whatever happens.
For example a suit malfunction, like a light electric shock without any électrodes connected to you  or your water Camelbak  leaking against your skin can be frightening and panic inducing, trust me, I know, dear.""

""If I order you to freeze and be quiet, you do it. I really don't want to have to lock you down  in the suit and inflate your gag when we're not shooting, but it's for your safety if you panic.

""If you feel a possible suit malfunction when we're alone together, let me know ASAP. I'll order you to stay still and tell me as calmly as possible what's wrong, what sensations you feel, etc. I'll notify our Dommes immediately, the information you share will help them troubleshoot the suit and get you out of it safely if they need to.""

""Panicking and being locked up and gagged in the suit is miserable, if Vivian, Slave Smelly Cunt, was here, she'd tell you. The dummy panicked and had to be locked down three times in the suit. Twice it was an easily patched water leak in her réservoir, and once she was being chafed by circuits with eroded padding. Easy fixes if she stayed calm.and followed orders. She made it hard on herself flailing around and panicking until we locked her at attention. Don't be a Smelly Cunt.""

She paused for breath. ""With me so far, Slave Zero?"" I replied ""Yes, Alpha Cindy."" She approvingly stated ""Good girl. Now if I have a suit malfunction, I'll contact our dommes, then relay to you what my sensations are and what you need to do if they can't get there quickly. If they need your help, do what they tell you. If not, stand quietly aside. If my Mistress or your Dommes have to lock you down, you'll regret it. I've spent a lot of time in those fucking things, I know how to punish you with misery without doing any permanent harm. Don't test me, slave, ever. Understood, Slave Zero?""

I dutifully replied ""Yes, Alpha Cindy."" Sarah said ""We're having a formal mid season bash, we're going to have Alpha Cindy as a server, without the suit's hoodpiece. You'll be fully suited in the kitchen under the control of Kitchen Manager Jules and her assistant Brianna. They'll be Mistress Jules and Mistress Brianna to you, of course."" I started to object that this wasn't in my contract when I consented to wear the suit...

Sarah had walked around to stare down at me. She anticipated my objection and held up a hand. She sounded professional, but a small smile played on her Asian lips. ""You're going to say your contract specifies that you only where the suit for shoots and training and orientation. This is going to be marked as a training and orientation session for you to help you get used to the suit. Don't worry, one of Dave's medical staff will be on duty tracking your vitals remotely. They can veto any command we give you or order you removed from the suit if they feel your safety is at risk.Mistress Jules will have a copy of your suit remote she can share with Mistress Brianna. As your direct supervisor, I'll have a copy of the remote, though I'm listed as a guest not your duty Alpha slave. Don't think I won't hesitate to intervene in disciplinary matters if I think it's warranted.""

Her grin got bigger. ""If you hadn't consented to wear the suit and signed a contract, it would have been Cindy in the kitchen in full suit. We probably would have given you a break and let you attend the party as an equal and a guest. But we have to get you trained up in the slave suit. Also this keeps our promise to Jules that she'll get you as her little ́Kitchen Slave.""
""Cindy does this all the time, since she's your lead and mentoress when you're both suited anyway, she deserves a break, we felt. I'm sure Jules and Brianna will appreciate your help."" That small, slightly cruel smile. She knew Jules resented me since I chewed her out about a late hot plate delivery, and Brianna followed Jules example. This is going to suck...

Sheila's perspective, later in the evening, outside the studio kitchen.

I'm  standing locked at slave attention in this stupid high tech slave suit, waiting for Mistresses Jules and Brianna to appear and give me my slave duties for the evening. Alpha Sarah and Alpha Cindy marched me here and Sarah locked me at slave attention with the suit remote she carried. She explained to me that this was how Mistress Jules wanted me to report as Kitchen Slave for the evening. When Jules and Brianna appeared I had to bow and greet them, in third person. And speak in third person, or refer to myself as ""it"" for the rest of the night as kitchen slave.

Alpha Cindy had her suit on but her girl parts were covered and she didn't have to wear the latex mask hood my head was snugged into. She also had custody of her own remote, in a holster at her hip, though she had to surrender it to one of my dommes, Dave or Mistress Jasmine if ordered. Sarah told me she was sure I understood that the concessions for her were because she had more experience in the suit, I had to learn to perform in it at it's most restrictive and humiliating, like it would be on set. I did understand. But it still was annoying.

I realize I spaced out, because I was startled when I saw Kitchen Manager Jules standing in front of me in her cook's whites holding up a copy of my suit remote. and smiling a wicked, gleaming smile. I would have jumped if the suit didn't keep me from moving a muscle, and the gag was fully inflated, keeping me silent. ""Daydreaming, Fuckface? Better get the lead out slave, Bri and I are going to run you ragged.""

Just then Bri propped up next to Jule's left, giving my exposed tits and pussy a-thirsty-gaze. ""Baby, forget the main course, you look good enough to eat in that suit."" I gulped as my young blond kitchen Mistress ogled me with impunity. I liked pretty girls, but there's something so demeaning about being groped and used against your will, even if the perptrator is sexy as hell.

Jules tapped her shoulder. ""Down girl, we're here to work."" I felt the light buzz of the suit releasing me. ""Bow and greet us, kitchen slave."" Jules decreed to me. I realized as I bowed that my liberty was very limited. I could bend at my waist to bow, but my arms were still locked to my sides and my feet locked in place. 

I bowed midway at the waist and groveled ""Slave Zero greets Mistress Jules and Mistress Brianna. Slave Zero is honored to serve as my superiors' kitchen slave. Slave Zero will perform all assigned tasks to the best of it's ability.""

I felt the buzz of the suit and realized Mistress Jules had locked me in my bow. I fought panic, and was grateful for my slave experiences with Ari and Nora. I could shut down panic and accept I had no control, waiting calmly for the decision of my betters. I tried to focus on blanking my mind to a receptive state.

Jules chose to ignore my greeting, a gesture that dripped in utter contempt.
I listened as she explained the remote options to Brianna and how she could partially limit my movement or freeze me in any position I got into. If I was stubborn and refused to do something. ""Lockdown mode"" default forced me to stand at  attention.

""All the punishment options on the suit are disabled besides lockdown mode. But we have the crops, floggers and other punishment implements Constance taught us to use. Also, I have a timeout spot picked for her right next to the ovens. We can shut off her water and suit cooling for a limited time. It will automatically come back on in a half hour at most, we have to restore it sooner if Mr. Henson's staff nurse tells us to. We have to call for her, she'll be in sickbay, to be in the room to monitor the slave if we shut off her cooling and water. I just found out from Mistress Sandy that we have to contact Alpha Sarah so they can conduct a discipline tribunal for her in the Ready Room to decide if she deserves that.""

Jules sounded eager to use her cruel, sweltering timeout on me. I really hoped my friends would look past whatever cruel pretense Jules came up with to use it on me. Please don't let Nora decide!

I felt a buzz and realized I was free to straighten up. ""Straighten up you fool, hurry up!"" Jules was impatient with my slow movement in the suit. ""Hurry up, you're going to help Bri in the deep sink."" She handed my young blond domme the remote.

Jules turned back in to the kitchen to order around her staff. Brianna leered at me a long moment. Then she got a serious look. She pressed a button on the remote and I felt the buzz all over my body that indicated she gave me maximum liberty in the suit.  ""Follow me, slave. I'll show you the basics of your job. Deep sink isn't hard, it's just mind numbing. Those piles of dishes look daunting at first, don't worry. I'll help you. This is actually my first time as a supervisor, so this ought to be interesting. C'mon.""

I dutifully followed my young supervisor, thinking that I had a lot of interesting things happen to me in my short life, and a lot of them suck... 

Sandy's perspective

I admired my party dress in the mirror. It was a white traditional Vietnamese Ao Dai that came down a little past my knees. I had a cute green Shamrock brooch on my right shoulder that read ""Kiss me, I'm half Irish."" in red lettering. On the left was a Pink lotus pin that said ""Me love my Master Dave long time."" Yes it was my idea, most of the girls thought it was too bawdy, Sheila thought I was demeaning myself and our Vietnamese heritage.  Even Dave said it wasn't appropriate for his girl to wear the lotus or the shamrock with such bawdy slogans.

""Listen, bro. You get your way in making me dress like a Miss Priss when I'm your arm candy for the evening. I can and will add my own personal touches. You wanna keep hitting this, let me be me."" He frowned deeply and folded his arms ""You're an even sassier little thing then your big sister."" I mirrored his posture and glared back. He smiled and folded me into a big hug. ""I wouldn't have you any other way, young lady."" I squeezed him back wishing we had time for a quickie.

Then my phone buzzed and Constance texted me that they needed me in the big bathroom in Dave's suite I started to think of as ""The Beauty Parlor"". This is where Sheila and the other girls primped and fussed over me when I made a formal public appearance with Davey. I had been showing Dave my party attire in his private dining room so at least it wasn't a far walk.

Dave hid a smirk when he read the text, he knows how much I hate ""The Beauty Salon"". I glared at him and he smacked my Daisy Dukes denim clad ass ""Run along, looks like your entourage wants to get started dolling up their little princess.""

I pecked him on the cheek then headed down the hall. I sighed. Sheila maybe a slave right now,  but she finally got her way about dressing me as a princess.

For background, when I was 6 and Sheila was 10, she wanted to dress me as a little princess for Halloween. Mom was delighted, even then she struggled to get me to play with girl toys and wear Sheila's hand me downs, I wanted to wear pants, t-shirts and overalls so I could roughhouse on the playground.

I tore off the costume three times, ""Saying I want to be a pirate, not a princess!""  They'd put it on me again and I'd tear it off again. Mom was about to forbid me from going trick or treating when she took Miss Priss, who of course was going as the prettiest princess she could dress up as.

Daddy finally laughed and said I could be a pirate if I wanted to. He even pulled out a pirate costume he got from the Spirit Halloween store. He said mom could take Sheila Trick or Treating, and he would take me. Mom relented, and all four of us went, we all actually had a lot of fun and made some fond memories.

Now I get costumed all girly every week, with Sheila fussing over me, somtimes just like she did when we were kids. My only consolation was she was the kitchen slave today, so she couldn't savor making little sister Sandy dress up.

But Constance and the other ladies made up for that. Constance wore a long blue southern gown with puffy shoulders, she even had a fan. Lara wore a fancy Gold Sari and a jewled choker. Sarah wore a long formal Hanbok red on top and blue on the bottom half, with pretty pink ribbons. Nora actually wore a hanbok similar to Sarah's, which was suprising. Normally she imitated Constance's Southern Belle chic when we all had to dress up for an occasion.

I thought about telling them to get out while I showered. But decided we're all big girls here, as steamy as we got on this set it seemed priggissh to worry about girls, most of whom I'd seen naked before, on video, if not in person, watching me shower.

Out of the shower, it's tempting to let Nora and Sarah dry me, but I don't want them to mess up their nice nearly  matching Korean outfits. After I'm try I put on a red velvet bra and red thong Nora hands me. Easy access for Daddy Davey....later in the night.

Lara blow dries my chair while I sit in the salon seat, as Constance marshals the other two girls to get my makeup stuff together. From puberty to seventeen I was a basic lipstick, mascara, eye shadow girl, if I was trying to catch a boy's eye. If I wasn't, or the boys just didn't care (A lot of them just wanted a go at ""Suck Slut Sandy's"" sexy mouth)  I just didn't bother with that prissy stuff.

I tried a little harder when I was trying to play a good southern girl at 17. I even asked my delighted mom for makeup tips and help. Her scraped up little tomboy finally wanted to embrace her femininity! But by then most boys said I was pretty enough without much makeup. My asshole ex Joey 
 said I was so trailer trash hot I didn't need makeup. I thought it was really sweet at the time. Now I look back and wonder what was wrong with that girl.

Now I have a team of make up artists led by a former  porn star. Assisted by a former professional dominatrix. Sarah and Nora are no slouches either, after 3 years of fetish Sci-fi under their belts. 

I let them pick color and tones for the most part, but I insist on bubblegum pink nail polish. It's my go to since adolescence, and I always got the attention of the boy I wanted when I wore it. Maybe it's just a luck thing, but hey.

Now I'm admiring my friend's handiwork posing in front of a full length mirror. ""Pretty as a picture, Sugar."" Constance assures me with her usual southern cliches. Lara says ""You truly look like young royalty, Sandy."" I reply, ""That's great, but I'm still a little trailer floozie inside."" My friends chuckle at my usual crudity, even dolled up.

Nora places a bejewled tiara on my head, and Sarah carefully adjusts it carefully. I want to throw the stupid, prissy thing across the room, but Dave spent a lot of money on it, I don't want to reject it out of hand. Sarah steps back and admires her handiwork. ""You're really beautiful, Sandy. I know you hate being dolled up, sweetie. But this is how Dave sees you even in your Gofer getup. I've never seen him let anyone into his heart like he has you, hon. People talk about the age gap, but you two seem like soulmates.

I saw my cheeks flush in the mirror. Davey and I...soulmates? I thought of the three men I loved erotically in my short life.

Joey made me feel pretty and desirable. For years he was just my dorky, loser frenemy, okay to hang out with, and always able to get us cigarettes, beer even some weed. I knew he had the hots for me, but always turned him down. Then he gets buff and hot Senior year, he could have any girl he wants. But this rich, handsome boy still wants little Miss mongrel trailer trash Sandy.

Of course, our time with Ari taught me I was just a prize to him. He let me get kicked down the ladder from his gf to his slave, once he had a white girl of his class. I was nothing but an object to him, even before I was tricked into slavery. Beneath his buff, handsome exterior, my first Prince was the same dweeby, self centered dork I grew up with.

Brian. Even now he makes my heart flutter. So strong, so handsome, so noble! Sure, he helped Ari do evil things, but so did I. I spent most of my time as a slave wishing for a second chance. Brian set the example for me on what to do when you get one. Be humble, help others even if it entails risk, see the good in people even when they can't do it themselves. I really wish we'd had more than that one beautiful moment in bed together.

Then Dave Hensen. Really cute for an older guy, really cute. But such a smug prick. I was pissed the bastard tranqued me when I swung at Sheila because I was worried about Logan. He seemed to have this smirking condescending attitude to women, even those he had leadership positions like my sister. Sheila told me when she first got here he was open about thinking women were irrational, delicate creatures who needed male protection, even from themselves. She said working with women closely for a few years had given him more respect for the female gender. I thought he'd just learned to moderate his views because a squad of cute little twats was helping him rake in what old rich dudes love, money. And the feeling he was undressing you with his eyes and fitting you for a collar whenever he looked at you.

Then I saw his soft side, the part he unsuccessfully tried to hide from us. Setting up that reunion with mom and Zoom call to Daddy in the hospital. The way he walked away wiping his eyes when mom and I shared that first tear filled hug.
He worked with Nora's Master to get her therapy, while keeping her star billing on The Perseverance. And facilitating her relationship with Sarah, because he knows it's good for her.

His paternal, protective attitude towards Lara, which didn't seem like his normal misogynistic bull. He apparently knew her as an exuberant but caring little girl, was impressed by her, and was glad she got back to being the humble, genourous person she is instead of a bratty, arrogant porn star. During our coffee chats it really felt like we were peers, instead of a boss with his female employees.

And his love and respect for Sheila. She told me the first year here, he was always trying to get into her panties, and they had a joking flirtation she thought wasn't so joking on his side. But I saw how he treated her with respect as a leader, and valued her input, if he couldn't openly admit he saw a mere woman as an equal.He never seemed jealous of her relationship with Lara either, rather encouraging it. He thought they were good for each other, just like Nora and Sarah.

Davey as my soulmate? The old, traditional misogynist who only late in life was starting to change his sexist view of women, and the bratty, independent feminist, who had a weak feminine spot for good men who were strong. It seemed unlikely. And yet here we were. Sarah and I smiled at each other. Once again, the usually quiet former Navy officer showed her insight and wisdom.

We were interrupted by a knock at the door. Flo, Dave's elderly female Chief of security, bellowed. ""You girls decent? Sorry to bother y'all, but there's an  message from Miss Katie that Mr. Henson wants y'all to take right away."" Constance shouted ""We're all decent in here, Flo, come on in!"" We traded looks as Constance opened the door for her. Had something happened to Layla? Here we are playing Dress Up while one of our leaders is taking all the risks and being humiliated to boot. I knew how guilty we'd feel if-

Flo had set up a laptop, and Mistress Katie grinned out at us from the screen with her usual ingratiating smile. It looked like she was wearing a turquoise southern evening gown with an opal between her breasts. ""My don't you gals look stunning! I always thought the story about Dave's stable of Disney Princesses was hyperbole. But looking at you ladies, I think they don't do you justice!

She took in our hard, serious faces. Her smile slipped a notch as she sobered a little. ""Don't worry, gals, Layla is fine. She's actually doing amazing as a new slave. Strong, resilient And she follows orders to perfection. I rent her out to women and couples who want a pet to walk while they hike. I always get rave reviews about what a good, obedient girl she is.""

""I just wanted you to know, she's going to be the entertainment at tonights party, along with my other slave, Smelly Cunt! I bet she's as excited to see y'all gals as you are to see her again.""

Slave Smelly Cunt. Former Mistress Vivian. Whom Dave suspects is not a volunteer. Looking at the puzzle pieces, I can see his suspicions being valid.

Katie stepped aside so we could see a tall, broad athletic female figure in one of the high tech slave suits. We knew it was female because the huge breasts and bristling yellow pubic thatch were exposed, and a pair pretty green eyes through her hood eyeholes. They were beyond desperation, to the look of a being just trying to survive in the moment, no thought of a possibly non-existent future. Those were the eyes I saw when I was forced to watch the vids I was made to do as a slave. I shuddered. Not a recall I liked.

The slave was standing tall with a crop in her right hand. In front of her was a bitch suited, pink hooded girl with large dark breasts hanging down. Layla, aka Slave Border Bunny!

Nora impulsively yelled ""Layla, girl, are you okay? Speak to us!"" The poor slave heard it as a command and lifted her hooded head mmmphing at her remote communication from her designated Mistress. We were shocked to see even though the hood was pink, it was a featureless blackout hood. Yeah, we blindfolded her to train Nora, but I got the impression Katie kept the slave in that thing for hours, maybe days.

Slave Smelly Cunt raised her suited arm and brought the crop down on Slave Border Bunny's ample brown butt. ""Silence Slave, bow your head."" Smelly Cunt commanded the slave, who immediately obeyed. Didn't take a deep thinker to figure out Smelly Cunt had been designated Border Bunny's Alpha Slave.

Katie was frowning at both of them. ""Smelly Cunt, I appreciate the initiative, but the slave heard a command from a superior and had to obey. Next time let me reprimand her, and decide if she needs to be punished. Got it, Smelly Cunt?"" She sternly admonished her slave. SSC emotionlessly replied ""Yes, Mistress Katie, I've got it.""

Katie's voice was softer when she addressed Layla. ""Dear, I know you were just obeying Mistress Nora, and you're happy to hear your friends again. But you're under our chain of command right now. You follow our orders. I trust your friends will refrain from giving you arbitrary commands that get you in trouble again."" She turned and her gaze seemed to pin a guilty looking Nora through the computer screen. Nora gulped nervously.

Her voice was a little shaky, but steadied up as she replied. ""My mistake, Mistress Katie, it won't happen again."" Katie nodded then turned on the high watt smile again. ""Oh, girls, I so wanted it to be a suprise, but I wanted to demonstrate what my girls can do with one of your betas. Dave insisited he didn't want you girls in the dark, all the stories about his misogony seem untrue, he really respects you ladies, a lot. Oh it's going to be a great party with my slaves and yours!""

We exchanged looks. We were glad we had a heads up she was coming, we could take precautions to protect Layla and Sheila, if it was needed. But I'd learned in this business that one obvious move was part of a bigger strategy, and could be a feint or misdirection. What game was Katie playing? And could we keep our brave, undercover leaders Layla and Sheila safe, while accomplishing the broader mission?

1hhksyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hhksyp/sudden_excruciating_headache/,Sudden excruciating headache,"Hello, 

I am desperately looking for advice on my situation. 

Four days ago, I experienced the most intense migraine that sent me to the ER. The pain was a 9 out of 10, causing me to vomit for a few hours before I decided to go to the ER for the first time in my life. The first hospital did a CT and then sent me to a bigger hospital immediately for an MRI. That hospital did the MRI, found some ""concern"", did a second MRI, and then a CT. I was told that the lymph nodes in my chest were swollen, which was the concern. I had been sick with a cold/cough for about a week at that point. The MRI found a 1.2 cm pineal cyst, but I was told that it was probably not significant, and I was referred to a neurologist for a follow up MRI in 1 years time. When I would cough, I would feel a pressure + pain spike in the place where my neck meets my skull.

A couple days later, while masturbating, I felt a pain rapidly (like over 4-5 seconds) develop to a 6 or 7 out of 10 from a 0. It went away after about 15 minutes. A couple days later (an hour ago), again while masturbating, I felt a sudden spike in the same area and a rapid explosion of pain. I writing this through gritted teeth. 

Maybe 5 or 6 months ago, I was having sex and when I was about to orgasm, I had a blinding explosion of pain that had me screaming on the floor. Two minutes later, the pain was gone. 

I've had normal intermittent migraines for years, in the past couple years they have been bad enough to be accompanied by vomiting. I mean serious enough that my thoughts turn to death. 

I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor, but the earliest is the 31st. 

The pain is almost unbearable, I'm scared, and I don't have an explanation. I quit smoking cannabis, increased my fluids, and decreased caffeine to 1 coffee per day as soon as I got home from the hospital. I'm taking Trintellix for depression. I don't know what other info to provide, but I have the documents the hospital  gave me. I'm more than happy to give whatever input is requested.

Any advice, theories, treatment...really any support or expertise is welcome. I'm mostly scared that this is going to kill me and I don't even know what it is. Feeling something like a rupture in your brain is terrifying let alone the actual pain that can last hours.

Please help. Thank you.",2,1734582584.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

She is new and I have gone in and seen her and chatted with her a few times. Things had felt really good, making a lot of good eye contact, conversation flowed well, and an overall good vibe. I wasn’t sure how to approach getting her number so I decided to leave a little message on a sticky note inside the cash tip I handed her. I did this so it wouldn’t be putting her on the spot as she is new to the job and I didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable.

Leading up to giving her the note, the conversation was good but I was slightly nervous because I’ve never done something like this while trying to get a girl. Once she handed me my coffee I pulled out the five containing the note and tipped her. It was a very not smooth ending because I said “oh yeah, tip” and set it on the counter and walked away. I forgot to say thank you or have a good day. Idk why but after that I was tweaking and felt like I messed it up really bad. Also I didn’t quite have the note sticking out of the cash and there is a chance she put it in the tip jar without seeing the note instead of unfolding the bill and reading the note.

that was yesterday at like 7:30pm and now it’s the day after at 11pm and she hasn’t added me on Instagram or texted me. I told my friend about it and he found her Instagram somehow. Idk what to do. I’m kinda scared to ever go back there. One of my friends said I should go back and bring it up. Another friend said leave it be and she’ll text you if she wants.
