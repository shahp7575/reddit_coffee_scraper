My name is Cam :) I'm 25 from eastern PA and would love to meet someone new and special! I'm sitting in my car waiting for work to start and listening to Billie Eilish so big vibing.

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Here's a little about me and what I'm looking for!\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\- I'm from NY so I have that accent with certain words still, very goal oriented and determined to get to a comfortable spot in my life. Also working on myself so I'm overall happier and more confident! Great progress so far and I'm excited for the future when I can look back and be proud of what I've accomplished.



\- I love coffee. Though this is a dream and I won't be able to do it. I would love to own a cafe and serve the best coffee I can possibly make to people! Every sip flavorful and clearly made with love and passion. But for now I'll stick to my espresso machines at home :)



\- Music is life. I've never been to a concert or anything but I want to! Some of my favorite artists in no particular order are : Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Boywithuke, Dean Lewis and Anson Seabra. The rest are rappers like Kendrick, Logic, Joyner, Eminem.. and the list goes on and on :D

\- 420 friendly but I don't really do it anymore it's been over a year.

\- Gamer and nerdy goober. I enjoy my freetime gaming with some friends. Right now I'm playing Minecraft, Elden Ring, Terraria, Valheim, League and Valheim! There are more but those are the main games. I have Dungeons & Dragons on Wednesdays and I'm so so excited to play it! My character is gonna be the goofiest bean I've ever played. I also enjoy making pixelart and painting miniatures I find online! I can show if you're interested but they're not amazing!

\- Personality wise I'm very open and happy. Confident about myself or at least I'm growing more confident each day. Can be a big flirt if the interest and attraction is there. But I love chaos (in moderation) just wanting to have fun talking and making jokes

\- Appearance : I'm 6'1 and have short dark brown hair. I'm noticing little grays in my beard so uh oh. Maybe it'll look good though! I try to keep myself presentable. I'm pretty slim/average weight but I've started working out more actively. Not gym rat levels, just trying to achieve a nice physique that makes me happy :) I also want to get some big tattoos done! 2 custom sleeves and a connecting chest tattoo. Probably more than that as well.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ what I'm looking for\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

someone I can be with on days off or freetime. Honestly I want my own lil gremlin. Just chaotic and funny. A goal driven person :)

\- A supportive partner. Sometimes I feel a little down and it would be lovely having someone there to fall back on. And being there for you as well.

\-Honest and Open communication about problems.

\- Honestly meeting another PC gamer would maybe be a lot of fun so if you're into that. <3

Thank you for reading! If any of me sounds fun to you. I'd love to chat \^\~\^

Every time i drank espresso at cafes in the past it was either bitter or served in a paper cup so tasted pretty underwhelming.

I love coffee and drank iced americanos as my daily go to from cafes to-go at least 4x per week for over a decade, so getting a machine both made sense in terms of cutting down the microplastic consumption and just the cost of buying americanos from cafes.

I tried:

- switching on and off 
- pulling out the cord

but the machine still doesn’t make the coffee! It grinds, and I can hear the water running inside it, but no coffee coming out. The water ends up in the tray. 

I can feel the upper left side of the machine getting pretty warm when it tries making coffee.

Any tips on how to fix this issue would be much appreciated!

I start modafinil in a few days. it’s taken years to get here. we still don’t really know what’s up, but I feel hope for the first time in a long time.

I’ve been trying to get help for my sleep issues for 3-ish years. I’ve had issues since I was a teen (I’m 24 now) but I always chalked it up to having a whack sleep schedule due to being super busy. but it’s gotten worse as I’ve gotten older, even though I’ve had periods of great sleep hygiene. for a long time, no doctors listened. I have severe depression and I am overweight. doctors (understandably!) assumed that was part of my issue. so testing and medication only ever looked into things related to that. I get why, it makes sense, but it never did anything, and my problems just kept getting worse and weirder.

even still, doctors turned away from me. after I did a nighttime sleep study that came back negative for sleep apnea, I asked my GP what’s next and she said nothing. I didn’t have the generic fat person sleep disorder, so in her mind, I was fine. my issues didn’t exist. my bloodwork was good, so I should quit complaining. I was always told “just exercise and you’ll feel better,” even though I told doctors that this health issue took away my ability to do exercise I enjoyed. I used to enjoy short-distance trail running multiple times a week. I was getting into hiking too, but I haven’t done either in over a year and I can’t fathom it now. going for a low-impact walk is all I can muster. it hurts to think about.

all the useless advice, too. oh, that’s the worst. “just drink coffee,” “have you tried energy drinks?” “I’ve heard adderall can fix that,” I’ve heard it all. I don’t know if it has to do with my sleep condition, but I have a high resistance to a LOT of drugs, prescription and otherwise. some of it is explainable; I am a redhead, so I have a high resistance to anaesthesia. but other things not so much. I have a VERY high tolerance to serotonin boosting drugs, so much so that >!a dose that should kill someone hardly affected me at all and left emergency doctors extremely confused!<. stimulants are the same too, and I’m sure folks here might relate. to feel any effects of caffeine, I have to drink so much in one sitting (1-2000mg) that it just makes me anxious, but still doesn’t keep me awake. I maxed out on adderall and felt nothing. vyvanse works, but it wears off in 3-4 hours instead of 8-12. I’m ashamed to admit that >!I have on-and-off abused street drugs just to stay awake!<. it is ridiculous.

what I’m saying is, it was so… weird to see this page. and see so many people describe things that are so relatable to me. because normally I talk about these things and NOBODY gets it. I find out that my common experiences are not normal. and it makes it even harder to live through, because you feel so alone. I don’t know where I’m at in my journey, but I feel like I’m making progress for the first time in a LONG time. my psychiatrist is finally a doctor who listens to me and advocates for me firmly, which has genuinely changed my life (she finally found me a depression medication that worked too, after 10 different medications and half a dozen psychiatrists). I have hope for once. maybe it’ll be ok.",1,1737937551.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

1iauxjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinballHelp/comments/1iauxjv/electrostatic_discharge_from_pinball_machine/,Electrostatic discharge from pinball machine,"Blew the solenoid fuse on my ""new"" Lightning pinball this morning. Replaced it and, thinking the static charge buildup is from the carpet (moving to concrete isn't an option), ordered rubber feet for each leg and also an outlet checker. Figured I need to make sure outlet is properly grounded. Those arrive in a couple days. For now, I thought maybe coffee coasters beneath each foot would help.

So with new fuse and coasters, I play again. Ball gets stuck since coasters aren't even. So I go to the left side of the machine to push it and help the ball roll out, and as soon as I push, it suddenly zaps my left leg. (Didn't hurt that much, just surprised me!) Machine replies to this zap with a funny Atari-like sound and freezes up.

Luckily none of the fuses blew this time; a restart brought everything back to life. However, I'm a bit paranoid now. I don't want any further zaps to damage the machine, so I'm leaving it unplugged. Other than rubber feet and outlet check, is there anything you guys do to safeguard against this?

I almost bumped in to him today when I turned the corner with cups of water to put out a fire in the cig trash can. Lol. 
He explained his keys weren’t working, I ended up needing to change his door battery. 
As I was making him new keys though, he asks me what days I’m working. I explained my days, and he’s says cool, I’ll see you tomorrow then. 
I tell him no, I gotta make sure his batteries aren’t dead. 
They were. I grabbed the wrong batteries because we didn’t have the ones we needed. 

I tell him to wait, and have to go on a hike for batteries. Once again, they did not work. I have to reach out to my manager , or MT man for permission to get keys and enter MT office as he’s off. He declines vacant room, and says he’ll just go with me instead. I said alrightyyyy. It takes a minute but I eventually here from my MT man, and he’s otp with me directing me as I’m getting in the elevator. This guest proceeds to come out of no where after sitting in the lobby. I didn’t tell him to come, I didn’t even speak to him when I walked off to the elevator.  He stuck his hand through the door to stop it, kind of smiled. 
I end up getting batteries , fixing his door, and I always let the guest enter before I fill out paper work and put screw back in door. I’m sitting on my knees , as I was going to screw back in the screw when he went inside. 
My goofy self says “ Thanks for your patience “ 
And he said, “ Thank you for your service” and chuckled and looked down at me for a hot second. 
Y’all. Y’all.  I was going to write my number down on a key but I got too flustered I forgot. 
I can’t make this up
Thank you for your SERVICE am I coocoo or that had induendo 






Original post:
For context: He has been checked in since March of 2024 and will be here through April 2025. He’s brought me ice cream, food on several occasions. I’ve run into him off property once on accident at a carnival. When his sister came to town, he introduced her to me. She kept joking about ringing the bell… teasing him almost… hahaha, before he actually introduced me to her they were exiting off the elevator and he said 
“ Speak of the devil “ when he seen me 
and she said , “ Oh she is pretty…” 

* While this is normal to meet guests family members due to the nature of our hotel, no one else met his sister. Nobody else on the team. And my coworkers made it a point to mention it to me. *

Shoot, he started a “ book club “ and would stop by my desk everyday for a month straight when he got back from work. The book club ended with him saying, “ I don’t read much.” And me saying, “ I can tell “ I realized he just wanted to chat. 

I was in the elevator and he proceeded to get on at his floor, and he asked me how my day was going, and then if there were cameras in the elevator and if they were working. I told him there were cameras and they were working. Cause that elevator was HOT AND STEAMY. 

He needed help in guest laundry room and proceeded to show me something on the app guests can use to do laundry on this phone. I turned to look, he turned to show me, and our arms full on touched. I sound like a school girl. However the reason this is a kind of odd is because  99.9% of the time when I touch a guest on accident we both immediately back away and apologize. It happens, not like this though. And we just stood there. For a solid 5 minutes. Talking about the app. Neither of us moved. Just kept touching. 

He went to go ask me what I was doing one weekend.. I said “ I’ll be here “ and he laughed and said, “ well me too then I guess “ before telling me about this dairy farm he wanted to go to for ice cream. The next day, he brought me ice cream from said dairy farm. 
—- 

with all of that being said, nothing has come of this. and I don’t think anything will, but then stuff like this keeps happening and it pulls me back in. 

recently went down to 2 days a week as I’m working at another site 5 days a week. This was brought up with my boss as he was asking me how it was going at the new site and asking how I felt about going part time at his site. 

I explained it’s going good, I definitely miss being full time but I’ve been ready for a change of pace for a while. 

This guest was in the lobby getting his coffee while we were having this conversation. 
 
He then approached the desk, needing his key remade, congratulating me on the new job and said, “ So this means I’ll see you even less then I already do? “ 

And I have no idea knowing what he meant by that. But damn did it make my heart race. He could have been relived for all I know. 

How do I move on from this?? Everytime I see him, even working two days a week my heart races. I blush so hard whenever he speaks to me. My boss will out right tease me. My AGM always refers to him as “ my friend. “ 

We have never crossed any physical boundaries. I’ve always tried my best to avoid that from happening. I’ve always said to myself if he wanted to ask me out he would.

I’m currently a first-year student in the exact college I wanted, and everything seems to have gone well for me. But my life hasn’t gone back to how it was before the college entrance exams. I’m dealing with depression, and everything feels so difficult. I haven’t been going to the gym to work out, I don’t clean my room, I barely eat meals, and even studying in the field I’ve always dreamed of . I have no social life at university; I spend all day sleeping, only drinking coffee.

I’ve never reached this point in my life before, but after the exams, I’ve become like this—especially during the time between the first-round results in June and the second-round exams in September . It was torture and one shock after another, and even after the second-round results in October and getting A+(99) in exams , I was still suffering and living with constant anxiety because having A+ (99) in exams in my country and especially my city is not enough . I gained weight during that time, even though I eat very little. My hair is falling out, my teeth are in bad shape, I haven’t gone to the barber, and my appearance has completely fallen apart.

I’ve tried multiple times to get back to my normal life, the way it used to be, and the way I want it to be. I even traveled , but I still can’t break out of this routine. It always ends up with me sitting in my room, not eating, not going out, just drinking coffee and sitting alone. Before the exams, I was social, had lots of friends, and went out often. After that period, I cut off everyone. I have no energy for friendships or conversations.

Instead, I’ve developed social anxiety and started avoiding talking to strangers or even friends. This has been my situation since the day the first-round results were announced up until this moment as I write this. On top of that, body dysmorphia has wrecked me. My face has changed, it looks worse, and I don’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore.

I’ve kept all of this to myself and never let my family know that something is wrong. I’ve tried not to make this a big deal for them, but inside, I’m exhausted. If anyone has gone through a similar experience, please tell me how you overcame it. I don’t want to stay like this.",1,1737937155.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Which led to me trying a bunch of things, many of which I was quite pleased with. However I then came across someone recommending Tale's recipe for ""Stall the fall."" 

It is really quite simple and I've been getting really robust, but we'll.seperated cups out of it with my setup. 

He uses 20g beans to 260g water, which a ratio I normally don't trend towards. But due to the super short immersion and drawdown, it isn't over extracted I find.

For the beans I'm using, I found much more pleasing sweetness and less funk by going 15g beans to 260g water.  But even as a starting point, he might be on to something here with other less ridiculously noted beans. (I do love them, but this is not the coffee to get your friends away from starbucks).

As for the method itself, he's closing the switch, dumping his full amount of water in first, then adding the ground on top. He then starts a 40 second timer and stirs to keep everything floating. 

At the end of the 40 seconds, you open the switch and keep stirring. This releases the brew super fast as the beans are not slowing it down yet settled in at the bottom like normal. You keep stirring through this until there's not enough water left to stir and then you let it do its drawdown, ideally before the 2 minute mark.

I wanted to share how I've started stocking up as someone who is new to this, and I call it ""soft-prepping"" or basically buying extras of the small luxuries that will be hard to spring for if prices truly skyrocket. 

Items including: shampoo, good smelling body wash, vanilla extract & spices, nice Maldonado salt, tampons, box hair dye, facial moisturizer, scented Epsom salt, sheet masks, makeup (backups of a few items), coffee, OTC medications, lice shampoo (anyone with elementary age kids should have a bottle under the sink at all times), laundry detergent, dish soap and melatonin. All of these items have relatively long shelf lives and won't draw vermin (my big fear when it comes to stockpiling food in my 100 year old house). 

TBH I can survive without all of this stuff and make do with cheaper alternatives, but if money gets tight I also know that these things are gonna help me feel like myself (or be good to trade if things get seriously wacky). I also want to point out that a lot of these items aren't especially expensive, but they are heavy/bulky, which means they are more expensive to ship. 

Just wanted to share in case it is helpful to others. I would love to know what would be on your list.

Lots of backstory so I'm sorry this is long; we went to the same high school but never really crossed paths. While in high school he dated this girl, let's call her Emma: Emma and my (now) boyfriend, who I'll call Charlie, dated for 4 years. I worked with this girl for a brief period of time at a local restaurant. I was never close to her, but I did know who she was. Emma and Charlie dated for most of high school and a year or two after high school. Their relationship was toxic, according to Charlie. They broke up and got back together multiple times, and officially broke up in March 2020. Also according to Charlie, the final breakup was really bad. Anyway, when I moved back from college to my hometown, I ended up on a double date with Charlie, one of his friends, and my friend. I recognized him right away, and he pointed out that we went to high school together. The date was fun and we started officially dating after months of hanging out.

I noticed multiple times when we were first dating that he often got calls from Emma. He would never answer them, but from what I heard from him and his friends, she reached out to him a lot. I wasn't super bothered because I kinda had to right to be, he wasn't ever responding. He told me at one point that he did talk to her on the phone and told her he was seeing someone and wanted to see it out. She stopped reaching out for a while so I thought we were past it.

A couple of months in I noticed a picture of Emma come up on his iPhone widget (ya know the ones that change around using photos in your camera roll) I knew my boyfriend's password and I looked through his photos. Now I know this is wrong, and I fucked up by looking, I should have talked to him about it. But I looked. I found an entire album of photos called ""She Doesn't Care About You"" There were pictures of them together, screenshots of pictures of her from Snapchat, and even nudes. I was horrified. I came clean and told him that I needed him to get rid of the pictures. He was defensive and said he purposely put them in a separate album when they broke up so he wouldn't see them and that he never looked at them. I still asked him to delete them. He was hesitant because it was ""a big part of his life"" so I didn't want to push. Weeks later, they were all still there. I told him it made me uncomfortable and he said he would go through and delete them later that night. He ended up accidentally sitting in the hot tub with his phone in his pocket and it broke. His phone wasn't backed up so all his pictures were gone.

Almost 3 years in at this point, hadn't heard from her so I thought we were good. Charlie told me he had to confess that Emma's mom had been calling him for a couple of days in a row so he finally answered and talked to her. She said Emma was still having a hard time moving on and she wanted to meet with him to get coffee. He wanted to check with him and I told him I didn't see the point in trying to get closure after they had been broken up for YEARS. He decided to respect my wishes and didn't ever go. I found a text from her on his phone the same week saying ""Your girlfriend is the Walmart version of me"" so I told him to block her. He felt that that was ""mean"" and ""dramatic"" so I blocked her from his phone. (Again I know that was not okay for me to do).

A year ago, Charlie got a call from a number he didn't have programmed into his phone, he answered and it was a girl saying they met at a bar and he gave her his number. He said he had a girlfriend and that she must be confusing him with someone else. I later discovered this was Emma's sister who called and made up a lie to try and get us to break up. I'm not sure of her intentions. 

That brings us to today. Emma called Charlie to ""apologize"" for how things ended between them. He answered the call in front of me because again, it came up as an unknown number. He just said it's fine and now isn't a good time to talk. When he hung up I asked who it was and he just said ""Who do you think,"" I said ""Emma?"" he said yes. I was taken aback because I had blocked her number years ago. I got upset because she will not stop reaching out to him. They broke up 5 years ago at this point. He ended up texting her telling her that he hopes she can move on and has a good life but that he doesn't appreciate her disrespecting his current relationship and girlfriend. She responded almost immediately and said ""Oh I wasn't trying to give you the impression I wanted to date you. I just wanted to say sorry for how I treated you when I was young. I'm happy for you and your girlfriend."" 

I'm so sick of her coming up after years of being with Charlie. I asked him to block her new number and show me when he does. He was upset by this and told me he believes she really won't ever reach out again so it shouldn't matter. I disagree and don't believe her. He has not been super trustworthy about all the situations that have happened in the past with her either, so I asked him to show me that he blocked her. He is frustrated that I am ""making a big deal out of nothing"" and overreacting. He didn't say I'm being an asshole, but he is reacting like I am being one. Should I have trusted that she wasn't going to ever reach out again? Am I an asshole for making him show me proof?",1,1737935763.0,AmItheAsshole,2,0.6,False

1iauc8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1iauc8r/temporary_crown_pain_when_chewing_drinking_hot/,"Temporary crown pain when chewing, drinking hot coffee and cool water","I got a temporary crown on a cracked tooth and a filling on the tooth next to it  on Thursday morning (today is Sunday so it’s day 4). Even though I’ve tried to chew on the opposite side, if any food makes its way over to my right side it feels like I cracked my tooth it hurts so bad. The first time it happened on Friday I thought that the crown must have fallen off or something. 

It’s also sensitive to my coffee which isn’t ever super hot as well as the cool water coming out of my fridge with no ice. The sensitivity could be coming from the filling but it’s really hard to tell. 

I’d probably let it go a couple more days but we are going to Disney world on Friday. When I asked her about eating she made it seem like I’d be fine to eat on it and wouldn’t have any pain. Before this, I was only a bit sensitive to cold and sometimes chewing on it and now I feel like I made a huge mistake getting this done before my trip. It was so much less painful to eat on it before the temporary crown and filling. 


Do you think this is normal? I’d hate to go in tomorrow for her to tell me everything looks fine and pay for the office visit but I obviously will if they thought they could do anything. ",1,1737935725.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I looked up book places (e.g. Bibliotheque, Book Club Bar) and they were packed on a Sunday afternoon. I've found a few tea houses but they charge through the nose (35$+ per person). Lower Manhattan is strategic because people come from all over (e.g. Brooklyn, Queens, UWS, UES, Jersey), so access to multiple subway lines + PATH is important. 

Something like a coffee shop with plenty of seating and not super loud (doesn't need to be trendy), a food court that won't kick us out, some sort of private room in a library, a cheap restaurant that is open in the afternoon and would be happy to have a few customers, etc.",1,1737935672.0,AskNYC,0,1.0,False

A week later, a beautiful woman appeared at my doorstep. She was strange, to say the least.","It streaked across the night sky, a shard of eternity slicing clean through the darkness. And there I was, staring out the kitchen window, hands submerged in soapy water, watching as something far grander than my little life decided to unfold. The view framed between the curtains looked like a painting brought to life, that fiery streak blazing its way across an endless, star-spattered canvas, as if the show had been cued up just for me.

I lived in an old house, weathered but stubborn, the kind of place that seemed almost stitched into the land itself. It had been my grandmother’s, then my mother’s, and now it was mine, though I often wondered if I was meant to want more than what they’d left behind. Out here, in the tame emptiness of Nowhere, USA, nothing extraordinary ever happened. This land was a monument to monotony, its cycles as predictable as the creak of floorboards under my feet at night.  

The days ticked by—the same cars kicking up dust on the gravel road, the same crops swaying under the same sun. Even time itself felt like it moved slower here. But tonight, the galaxy had reminded me the world was bigger than these four walls, bigger than the field stretching endlessly behind the house. And for the first time in a long time, I felt small in a way that didn’t crush me.  

This meteor shower wasn’t just an interruption. It was *the* interruption. The kind of cosmic performance that stops you in your tracks, makes you forget the pile of dishes you’ve been putting off, and lets you imagine something brighter, larger, and maybe even better.  Then my eyes caught it; one streak among many, but this one burned differently. A defiant, fiery thread, as though it had pulled free from the tapestry of the stars. 

It moved like it was alive, brighter than the others and wild with purpose. I found myself gripping the edge of the sink, leaning closer to the glass as though I could somehow touch it. I wanted to reach through the window, out past the night, and catch it in my hands before it disappeared forever.  

And then, impossibly, it changed.  

The streak jolted sideways, bending so sharply it was like the sky itself had flinched. My stomach dropped. Meteors didn’t do that. My breath hitched as the light folded into a dive, nosediving toward the earth with the precision of a hawk closing in on its prey.  

The streak disappeared behind the treeline at the edge of my family’s property, plunging into the forest with an unearthly kind of force. My heart felt like it was trying to hammer its way through my chest, beating louder than it ever had in this quiet, predictable place. 

For a moment, I braced myself, gripping the counter, waiting for the boom—the explosion. Surely, the ground would shake, the windows would rattle. Maybe a column of fire would rise into the sky like a signal from whatever corner of the universe it came from.  

But nothing came.  

No crash, no fireball, no tremor. The night remained as still as it had been seconds before. The only sound was the faint sigh of wind brushing through the trees, as though the forest had caught the meteor in its arms and hushed it back to sleep.  

 My body surged into motion, adrenaline igniting every nerve. I threw open the back door, the old screen slamming against the frame, and bolted into the yard. I didn’t stop to grab a flashlight or even think. The thoughts swirling in my brain pushed me forward faster than my boots could handle. The brittle crunch of grass and dirt underfoot echoed in my ears as I tore across the yard, the moonlight carving long, frantic shadows of my limbs against the ground.  

The cool night air burned against my throat with each breath, but I kept running, chasing the glow imprinted in my memory. That thing from the sky—whatever it was—had landed out there, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

My feet beat a frantic rhythm as I sprinted toward it, weaving between the familiar rows of wild grass. My chest heaved as I imagined it; a hunk of smoking rock, alien and unmistakable, something I could claim as mine. It could be valuable. No, bigger than valuable. It could be *legendary*.  

The field fell away behind me as I reached the forest's edge. The shadows deepened here, the moonlight barely making it past the thick canopy above. My steps slowed. I moved cautiously now, the dry grass transitioning into lumpy dirt and scattered stones beneath my boots. 

The clearing emerged ahead, a pale, circular space where the moon hung low, spilling its ghostly silver light over the ground. I hesitated at the edge of it, my rapid breaths fogging faintly in the cool air. Something here was wrong. I didn’t know how or why, but I felt it. The air had changed. It wasn’t just quiet; it was alive with tension, like the moment before lightning strikes.  

The woods were eerily silent.

Then the sky shifted.  

I tilted my head upward just in time to see them, a chaotic swarm of birds fleeing the treetops. Black shapes against the gray sky, their frantic wings beating like drums in an irregular rhythm. They weren’t just startled; they were scared. I could feel their panic in the air as they veered north, moving as a single mass away from the clearing.  

I swallowed hard, forcing down the nerves clawing at my chest.

After what felt like an eternity of trudging through the woods, I finally saw it, the source of the glow I’d glimpsed earlier. The faint red light flickered between the trees, pulsing like a heartbeat, drawing me closer with each cautious step. I pushed through brambles and uneven ground, my boots crunching on twigs, until I broke through a thicket and stopped dead in my tracks.  

It wasn’t a meteor.  

Nestled in a shallow crater of upturned soil and broken roots was something utterly alien. It gleamed under the faint moonlight, its surface smooth and metallic, reflecting the faint flicker of its own red beacon. The object stood at least twice my height, its sphere so unnervingly perfect it felt out of place against the chaotic wildness of the forest. Its surface shimmered faintly, like steel kissed by oil, shifting subtly as I moved closer.  

I froze, staring at the thing in utter disbelief. I’d seen meteors on TV, in books—jagged chunks of rock scorched by their plunge through the atmosphere. This was no lifeless hunk of space debris. It was *designed*. Built.  

A metallic pod, pulsing with purpose.  

My chest tightened as I edged closer, the soil beneath my boots loose and uneven from the thing’s impact. The air around it felt thicker somehow, weighed down by an unseen presence. 

Then it happened.  

With a hiss of air so sharp it made me flinch, a jagged seam split across the surface of the pod. For a moment, it was silent, the opening unmoving, holding its breath. And then, with a mechanical groan, a hatch folded open, spilling pale light across the disturbed ground.  

I stumbled back instinctively, my pulse hammering in my ears. My foot caught on a root, and I barely kept myself from falling flat. Heart in my throat, I scrambled behind the nearest tree, pressing my back against the rough bark like it might save me from… whatever *this* was.  

Peeking around the trunk, I squinted at the pod, the blinking beacon casting faint shadows that danced across the crater. The opening gaped wide now, glowing faintly from within. I swallowed hard, forcing my breath to stay quiet. My lips moved before I could stop them.  

“What the *hell* is that?” I whispered, the words barely audible, my voice cracking just the tiniest bit.  

The cold air fogged in front of me as I stood there, frozen, gripping the bark for stability. I didn’t know what to expect—not in the slightest.

From the open hatch, something began to spill—a dark, viscous substance that shimmered faintly under the moonlight. The fluid moved with unsettling intention, pooling across the disturbed soil before slithering upward, scaling the exterior of the pod in slow, undulating waves. It spread across the metallic surface like ink in water, coating the pod from top to bottom until the entire structure seemed to shift hues, the perfect sphere now cloaked in rippling violet.  

I stared, unable to move, my fingers digging into the bark of the tree. The slime pulsed, moving with a life of its own, its motion hypnotic and wrong all at once. Then, as suddenly as it had started, it shifted direction. The ooze began to retract, sliding back down the pod and pooling at its base once more with a wet, sickening sound.  

The red beacon atop the pod blinked once, then went dark.  

 Then, from inside the hatch, something began to move.  

A figure.  

At first, it was just a shape—a folded form, curled tight like an embryo in a womb. The light from the pod’s interior reflected off it, revealing a body of smooth, seamless silver. 

Slowly, impossibly, the figure began to uncurl, stretching its limbs with the eerie fluidity of liquid metal. It emerged, stepping out of the hatch with deliberate grace, its movements alien and mechanical all at once.  

My heart seized as the silver form straightened, standing tall and still as a statue. It had no eyes, no features to speak of, but somehow its polished surface gave off the impression of awareness. My stomach twisted into a knot as it tilted its head unnervingly, turning directly toward my hiding spot.  

“I can see you over there.”  

The voice cut through the air like a blade, cold and mechanical, layered with a deep, unnatural reverb that dug into my chest. 

“You’re scared, so the heat of your body makes you easy to see. I think they call it fight or flight.” 

The words sounded alien, a monotone growl paired with an echoing distortion that made my skin crawl.

It stood motionless for a moment, its featureless, silver head fixed in my direction, as if daring me to act. The air seemed to vibrate with the weight of its presence. 

My body, however, needed no prompting.  

Instinct took over.  

I ran.  

Panic surged through my veins as I tore through the woods, feet slipping on uneven ground and snapping twigs underfoot. 

I didn't dare look back.  

The forest blurred around me, shadows giving way to moonlight as I burst out of the trees and into the field, the open space offering no comfort. 

By the time I slammed the back door shut behind me, every part of my body was trembling. I locked it without thinking, leaning against the door and gasping for air, my mind reeling.  

I returned to the kitchen, I just stood there, gripping the counter and staring out the window. The yard stretched into the night, its emptiness giving nothing away. In the distance, beyond the treeline, the forest loomed silently, as if nothing had ever stirred within it.  

My eyes scoured the property for any sign of movement. Nothing. Not a glint of silver, no shimmer of violet ooze creeping toward the house. I wanted to believe I was safe, that whatever had stepped out of that pod was gone—or maybe, just maybe, had never existed. Once I was certain I hadn’t been followed, I forced myself to step away from the sink and head to my bedroom.  

Collapsing onto my mattress, I pulled the covers over me like they might shield me from the memory of what I’d seen. My mind replayed it against my will, the silver humanoid, the sound of its voice cutting through the woods, the way it had turned toward me without so much as a glance.  

“This is just a dream,” I whispered to myself, my voice small and unconvincing. “Just a weird, *weird* dream.”  

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing sleep to take me, hoping morning would bring the kind of clarity that only daylight can offer. But sleep didn’t come easily, and when it finally did, it was restless, fractured by vague, unplaceable nightmares.  

A week passed.  

At first, every sound around the house set me on edge—the groan of the old wood floors, the hum of wind moving through the chimney, the distant rustle of trees beyond the yard. I kept waiting for something to happen, for a knock at the door in the middle of the night, for silver fingers to tap against the windows, for… *something*.  

But nothing came.  

Life settled back into its usual rhythm, slow and ordinary as always. The days felt long but uneventful.

A week turned into routine. The silver figure stayed in the woods, or maybe it had vanished altogether, swallowed up by the same darkness that had delivered it. I stopped peering out the window so much. Stopped holding my breath at night, waiting for some metallic voice to call my name.  

One languid afternoon, I slouched on the faded couch in the living room, the hum of the old television casting a lazy glow against the walls. The screen buzzed with the muted chaos of a sitcom.

I wasn’t watching, not really. The cheerful noise was just a distraction, a barrier between me and the uneasy silence pressing against the edges of the room. My gaze drifted absently to a crack in the wall, the kind of crack that seemed to grow longer every time you noticed it.

And then, a knock at the door.  

It wasn’t loud, but in the stillness of the room, the sound cut through like a blade. I flinched, jolted out of my haze, a prickle of unease sliding down my spine. Out here, knocks didn’t happen. Not casually, anyway. My nearest neighbor lived a mile away from me, and even they only stopped by once a year—maybe twice if they were desperate for a tool.  

For a moment, I froze, staring at the door as though it might knock again on its own. My heart thudded faster, not out of fear exactly, but out of that strange mix of curiosity and dread you feel when something shifts out of place, when the expected rhythm of your life is disrupted. Finally, I pulled myself up from the couch, each step deliberate, my breath steady but shallow.  

I reached the door. Peeking through the peephole, I saw… her.  

A woman.  

Not just any woman.  

I opened the door cautiously, my grip still firm on the knob, and then—everything stopped. She was standing there, framed in the late-afternoon light like she belonged in another world entirely. She wasn’t just beautiful; she was *impossible*. The kind of beauty that makes you question reality itself, that warps the air around it. Her features were so precise, so flawless, that they seemed engineered—high cheekbones, luminous skin, and eyes that shimmered with a light that didn’t quite match the dim road behind her. Her hair cascaded over her shoulders in soft waves, the strands catching the sun just enough to make them seem unreal.  

And then she smiled. Not a big smile—small, subtle, almost knowing, like she already understood exactly what I was thinking. It hit me like a physical force, that smile. My tongue felt heavy in my mouth as I struggled to find words.  

“Hi,” she said, her voice as soft and smooth as velvet, with a musical lilt that tugged at something deep inside me. “I’m really sorry to bother you, but my car broke down just up the road.”  

I blinked, my brain stumbling over itself to keep up. “Oh, uh… did you need to use my phone or something?” My voice cracked—a humiliating betrayal—and I could feel the heat rush to my face.

She tilted her head, her smile deepening just a fraction. “No, actually. I was wondering if you might let me stay here for a few nights? Just until I can get someone to tow it into town. If that’s all right with you, of course.”  

For a moment, all I could do was stare at her, her words hanging in the air as my brain fumbled to process them. A strange woman, out here in the middle of nowhere, asking to stay in my house. Alone. Every rational part of me screamed that this wasn’t just unusual—it was downright bizarre. Alarms should have been blaring in my head. Red flags should’ve been stacking up like a tower. But there were no alarms, no flags. There was just *her*.  

Because nothing about her felt ordinary.  

I hesitated, my gaze flicking over her again, searching for some fault, some crack in the façade that might make sense of all this. But there was nothing. Only her perfect symmetry, her strange, steady calm, and the way her presence seemed to fill the space around her, like she was bending the world to suit her needs.  

I lived alone—had for years—and the idea of sharing my space, even temporarily, felt foreign. But then there was another thought, creeping in before I could stop it: *What if this was it?* What if she was the one? What if life, for once, was daring to hand me something extraordinary?  

I swallowed hard, clearing my throat as I tried to mask my hesitation. “Uh… yeah. I mean, why not? Sure. That’s fine.”  

The moment the words left my mouth, her face lit up with a smile so radiant it almost hurt to look at. Her teeth were dazzling, impossibly white and straight, like the glossy perfection of a magazine ad brought to life.  

“That’s so kind of you,” she said, taking a step closer. Her movements were graceful, deliberate, like she’d rehearsed every shift of her weight, every subtle glance. “Thank you so much for this. I promise I won’t be any trouble.”  

I stepped aside, my pulse quickening again as she brushed past me into the house. 

I lingered in the doorway for a moment, staring out at the empty road, half-expecting someone else to appear. A friend, a tow truck, anything to make this situation feel more grounded. But there was nothing. Just the fading daylight and the sound of her faintly humming to herself as she settled inside.  

I shut the door, the weight of it clicking into place behind me.  

This wasn’t how I thought my day would go.  

And yet, as I stood there, watching her impossibly perfect form moving through my living room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d just stepped into something I wasn’t prepared for. Something I couldn’t fully understand.  

But then again, when life hands you the unthinkable, who are you to question it?  

We exchanged the usual pleasantries, the kind that fill the quiet but don’t say much. Names, places, vague snapshots of our lives. I told her where I’d grown up—a small, overlooked city with nothing to its name but a few dying factories and a football team no one rooted for. She smiled politely, her attention fixed on me like I was reciting something fascinating. But when I asked her where she was from, she hesitated.  

“Oh, just a small town,” she said, her voice light and airy—but hollow, like an echo in an empty room. The words felt rehearsed, detached, as if she didn’t quite believe them herself. She didn’t offer more, and I didn’t press her, though the vagueness clung to me, gnawing at the edges of my curiosity.  

It wasn’t just the way she dodged questions. It was the way she moved through the house, like a ghost learning to haunt it. She floated from room to room with slow, deliberate steps, her gaze trailing along the furniture, the pictures on the wall, the leftover clutter I hadn’t bothered to tidy up. Her silence wasn’t shy—it was calculating. Like she wasn’t just taking in her surroundings but studying them. Like she was *studying me*.  

I tried to push the thought aside, chalking it up to my overactive imagination. But the first real crack in her facade came during dinner.  

I’d thrown together a modest meal—the kind of casserole that carried the taste of nostalgia more than actual flavor, lifted straight from one of my mom’s old recipe cards. A couple of beers sat on the table, condensation sliding down the bottles as we ate under the soft glow of the TV. The sitcom I’d left on earlier was still playing—some cheap, laugh-track-laden comedy about mismatched roommates. Background noise.  

At first, we ate in silence, the clink of forks on plates the only real sound between us. But I could feel her eyes on me, watching, observing, as if trying to decode something. Every so often, she’d glance away, but not before I caught the flicker of her stare.  

Then it happened.  

The first canned joke—a predictable gag about a character slipping on a banana peel—landed. I chuckled, barely thinking about it, the laugh more a reflex than genuine amusement. And then she laughed.  

But it wasn’t a normal laugh.  

It was loud, sharp, almost violent—a *guffaw* that reverberated through the room like the crack of a whip. My fork froze midair, and I turned to her, startled. She was staring straight at the TV, her face stretched into a broad grin that didn’t look quite right, her cheeks pulled just a little too high, her eyes just a little too blank.  

The laugh didn’t belong to her.  

It didn’t stop there. Every time I so much as cracked a smile at one of the sitcom’s tired punchlines, her laugh followed a beat behind mine, booming and hollow. It was never quite in sync, always just a second too late, as if she’d been waiting for her cue. I started holding my reactions in, just to test her, to see if she’d do it unprompted. She didn’t. The ripple of laughter only came when I made a sound, like some eerie mimicry of my own responses.  

By the third or fourth round of her strange, echoing guffaws, I couldn’t focus on the show anymore. My attention was fully on her, on the way her face twitched into that overly controlled smile with each laugh. It wasn’t just the sound that was wrong—it was everything about her in those moments. The way she barely touched her food, pushing it around her plate in smooth, absent gestures. The way her movements felt mechanical, deliberate, as if she were mimicking a routine she’d seen but never lived.  

I tipped my beer back, the bottle cold against my lips, trying to settle my nerves. Maybe I was overthinking it. Maybe she just had one of those laugh styles that didn’t match her appearance. Maybe she’d never grown up watching this kind of slapstick nonsense.  

But no matter how I tried to rationalize it, the feeling lingered—that creeping realization that whatever she was doing, it wasn’t natural. It wasn’t the laughter of someone who *felt* the humor—it was the laughter of someone who *wanted* to feel it, who was trying to piece it together, like an actor who hadn’t quite learned their lines.  

The TV droned on, the sitcom’s overblown laugh track filling the gaps in our conversation. I glanced at her out of the corner of my eye, my thoughts tangling in themselves. She looked perfect, just as stunning as when I’d opened the door to her earlier, her features serene and unbothered. But now there was something beneath that perfection, something rippling under the surface.  

Something I couldn’t name.  

I swallowed another sip of beer, the realization flickering momentarily before I buried it.  

*Don’t overthink it,* I told myself.  

Then her phone rang.  

It wasn’t loud, just a soft, mechanical chime, but it shattered the fragile awkwardness hanging between us. Her hand twitched, freezing for a fraction of a second before she reached into her pocket and pulled it out. The screen’s pale glow lit up her face, but her expression was neutral. Too neutral. She glanced at it the way someone looks at a crossword clue they’re not interested in solving. Then, almost as an afterthought, she turned to me with a practiced, apologetic smile.  

“Sorry, it’s my friend. I need to take this,” she said, her voice light and pleasant, as though the moment wasn’t strange at all.  

“Of course.” I nodded quickly, almost glad for the break from the strained air between us. I watched as she stood and stepped into the hallway, her movements as fluid and deliberate as ever. The faint sound of the ringing phone echoed through the house, growing softer as she drifted further away.  

And then it stopped.  

I turned back to the TV, grateful for the distraction, but as the seconds stretched into minutes, a strange realization struck me.  

I didn’t hear her speak.  

The sitcom continued its parade of jokes, each laugh track punctuating the silence like a metronome, but I couldn’t hear anything else. No soft murmuring. No hushed explanations to her so-called friend. Just… nothing.  

My stomach tightened.  

Setting my fork down, I tried to focus on the flashing images on the screen. Maybe she was just listening. That wasn’t weird, was it? Some people pause when they answer the phone, waiting for the other person to ramble on. But no matter how I tried to rationalize it, the silence pressed heavier on me with every passing second.  

I leaned back in my chair, my ears straining for any sound. The creak of a floorboard, a murmur too faint to decipher—*anything*. But all I could hear was the canned laughter and the low hum of the refrigerator humming from the kitchen.  

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to take deep breaths. Just let it go. Just let her be.  

Except I couldn’t.  

That night, sleep refused to come. I tossed and turned, my body restless, my mind circling the pieces of the evening like a moth trapped under a glass. On paper, nothing had gone wrong—but still, something gnawed at me. Disappointment. Unease. A creeping realization that the connection I’d foolishly imagined with her wasn’t forming. I’d let myself hope for something life-changing, something extraordinary, and instead, I was left with a feeling I couldn’t shake.  

At some point after midnight, I gave up. Frustration dragged me downstairs for a smoke, the house heavy with that peculiar after-midnight stillness where every creak in the floor feels deafening.  

I padded into the kitchen, the soft light from the porch filtering through the window. It wasn’t much, just enough to cast faint shapes into the dark room. But it was enough for me to see *her*.  

She was sitting at the kitchen table, hunched over slightly, holding the carton of milk in both hands. Her head tilted back, her throat moved with greedy, almost desperate gulps, like she hadn’t had a drink in days. The milk sloshed audibly as she drank straight from the carton, her body tense, focused, transfixed.  

I froze in the doorway. For a moment, confusion and irritation wrestled in my chest, neither quite winning.  

“Uh… what are you doing?”  

She stopped mid-sip, lowering the carton slowly. Her lips were streaked with milk, glistening in the dim light as she turned to look at me. Her expression was calm, unbothered, like there was nothing unusual about what she was doing.  

“I didn’t think this would taste so good,” she said evenly, her voice carrying the same strange rhythm I was starting to associate with her mannerisms. “Considering it comes from an animal.”  

I blinked, her words catching me off guard. “What are you talking about?”  

Her head tilted slightly, as though she were weighing how to answer. “I’ve never had milk before.” She held the carton up like it was some kind of trophy, her tone matter-of-fact, like this was the most normal confession in the world.  

I furrowed my brow, staring at her. “You’ve never had milk before? You said you grew up in a small town.” There was an edge to my voice now, disbelief mixing with unease.  

She shrugged like the conversation bored her, as if the specifics didn’t matter. “I didn’t think much of it.”  

“Well,” I muttered, trying to stifle the irritation bubbling to the surface, “small town or not, it’s rude to drink out of the carton in someone else’s house. You know that, right?”  

For a moment, she just stared at me, her head cocked slightly, her expression unreadable. Then, as though remembering the appropriate response, she nodded. “I’m sorry,” she said flatly. The words came easily, but there was no weight behind them. No real apology.  

Her affect startled me, disarming my annoyance almost immediately. She wasn’t defensive, but she wasn’t contrite either. It was like she’d said the words because that’s what people say in these situations—not because she felt them.  

“It’s… it’s fine,” I murmured, the tension in my voice softening. I turned away to grab the pack of cigarettes from the counter and lit one, inhaling deeply. Smoke curled around me as I leaned against the doorframe, my gaze falling back on her.  

She hadn’t moved. She just sat there, unnaturally still, her hands now folded neatly in her lap. There was something unsettling about her composure, the way she made no effort to mask the fact that she was watching me. Her pupils caught the faint light, reflecting it just enough to make them gleam in the dim kitchen.  

I took another drag. “You, uh, planning to go back to bed soon?” I asked, trying to hide the unease gnawing at me.  

She smiled faintly, her lips curling in that same strange, deliberate way I’d seen earlier. “I wasn’t tired,” she said simply.  

I exhaled slowly, the smoke hanging thick in the air. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but something about this moment—the milk, the stillness, her whole demeanor—felt wrong in a way that disturbed me more than I wanted to admit.  

I woke in the early hours of the morning, the house pressed under a suffocating silence. The faint glow of the moon slipped through the blinds, casting thin, pale lines against the ceiling. Something was wrong—I felt it in my chest, an ache of inescapable dread, sharp and oppressive, though I couldn’t explain why.  

The air seemed heavier, colder. My breath felt loud in the stillness as I slid out of bed and crept toward the bathroom. The floor creaked softly beneath my feet, each sound amplified in the perfect quiet.  

And then I heard her.  

As I passed the door to the guest room, her voice drifted out—low, steady, and chillingly precise, words delivered with an almost mechanical perfection. She was on the phone. Actually speaking this time.  

I froze in place, my heart thudding against my ribs. The door was cracked open just enough to let her voice slip through. I leaned closer, barely daring to breathe, straining to hear every syllable.  

**“The initial data transfer is complete,”** she said, her tone detached, clinical. **“The subject’s neural pathways have been mapped. Did you receive the biometric readings?”**  

Biometric readings? My stomach churned, my skin prickling.  

She paused, listened, then spoke again.  

**“Affirmative. The integration process will commence upon arrival. This dialect is… inefficient. We will adopt the local vernacular for the duration of the harvest.”**  

Harvest. 

The word rang in my ears like a warning bell.  

Her voice was calm, but there was something unnervingly final about it. No hesitation, no inflection. Just cold, calculated purpose.  

**“This planet is… bountiful,”** she continued, her tone unwavering. **“Rich in organic compounds, readily available water, and a diverse range of… biological specimens. A truly fertile ground for cultivation. The yield will be substantial. You all will thrive here. The harvest will be plentiful.”**  

My knees wobbled beneath me, the blood draining from my face. I clenched the doorframe to steady myself, feeling the chill of the wood under my fingers. Her words were wrong—too detached, too clinical to be anything but terrifying.  

She began pacing, her footsteps soft but deliberate, her shadow shifting across the faint light spilling into the hallway.  

“Are the preparatory measures finalized?”** she asked. **“The designated areas are primed for seeding? There is no turning back from this. This world is designated for reclamation. It is ripe for the harvest. Everything we require is already here, waiting for us to begin the reaping.”

She paused again, listening to whoever—or whatever—was on the other end of the line. When she spoke again, her voice sharpened, her tone carrying an edge of authority.  

“No. Physical transport is unnecessary. The energetic cost would be prohibitive. Why expend the resources when I can translocate you directly to the surface, ready for the harvest? It is far more… economical.”

“I have already established a primary vector. A… vessel, if you will. It is ripe for the taking. Ripe for the harvest.”

She said it so calmly, like it was nothing. But that word—*harvest*—felt like a blade slicing through me. I didn’t want to know what it meant.  

When she spoke again, her voice dropped, quieter but even more resolute.  

“Understood. Await the commencement of the harvest. The reaping will begin shortly.”

That was it. I couldn’t stay any longer. My legs moved on their own, carrying me back to my room as silently as possible. My heart was pounding so loudly I thought it might give me away.  

Once inside, I shut the door softly, pressing my back against the wood. My breaths came shallow and fast, my skin clammy with sweat. I slid down to the floor, my hands shaking uncontrollably as her words repeated in my mind.  

*""This world is designated for reclamation… ripe for the harvest.""*  

I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t. Her voice haunted me, replaying over and over as if my brain refused to let go of it.  

*""Ripe for the harvest.""*

I lay there, frozen in the bed, staring at the patterns of moonlight splashed across the ceiling. The shadows seemed to stretch and shift, alive with the weight of my terror.  

*""Ripe for the harvest.""*

I told myself to sleep. To pretend I hadn’t heard anything.  

But then, the floor creaked.  

The sound was faint at first, so soft I thought I imagined it. But then it came again. Louder. Closer.  

My breath hitched.  

The guest room door opened.  

The slow, deliberate creak of the hinges sliced through the quiet, setting my nerves ablaze. I clamped my hand over my mouth to hold in the gasp that threatened to escape.  

The hallway outside my room filled with the faint sound of her footsteps.  

I forced myself to move, inching out of bed and to my door. My fingers trembled as I turned the knob, easing it open just enough to peek through the gap.  

She was there.  

But she wasn’t *her* anymore.  

Its skin gleamed in the moonlight, a shimmering, metallic silver that caught the faint light like polished steel. Its movements were smooth, inhuman, head tilting unnaturally as if it were scanning the hallway.  

It stepped forward, it’s glowing silver form filling the narrow corridor, and turned its head toward my door.  

**“Ripe for the harvest.”**  

I slammed the bedroom door shut, my chest heaving, panic crashing over me in waves.

I ran for the window.  

My fingers fumbled with the latch, shaking so violently it took me three tries to get it open. The frame stuck at first, stubborn and unyielding. 

“Come *on*,” I hissed under my breath, yanking at it with all the strength I could muster. Finally, with a groan of shifting wood, it loosened, sliding open just enough for me to squeeze through.  

The chill of the night air hit me as I swung one leg over the sill, then the other. For a split second, I hesitated. It wasn’t a short drop. The ground below seemed farther than I’d expected, the slope uneven, littered with dormant grass and jagged rocks.  

But staying was worse.  

With a deep breath, I pushed off.  

The world blurred for a brief second before my legs hit the ground with a brutal thud. Pain shot through my body like a bolt of lightning, and I crumpled forward, clutching at my knees. A sharp, dry gasp escaped my lips. My mind screamed for me to stop, to assess the damage, but I couldn’t. Not now.  

Adrenaline surged, numbing the worst of it. My legs screamed in protest as I forced them to move, stumbling forward into the dark. Every step sent shards of pain ricocheting through me, but I didn’t care. I couldn’t stay still. I couldn’t let her catch me.  

The neighbor’s house. One mile away.  

I focused on that single thought, clinging to it like a lifeline as my battered legs carried me forward. The forest seemed endless, the shadows stretching and contorting under the faint moonlight, each one threatening to spring to life. Every rustle was her. Every flicker of movement was her.  

“Don’t look back,” I told myself. A mantra. A desperate prayer.  

By the time I reached his house, I was barely standing. The small, sagging structure sat quietly at the edge of the road, its porch light casting a weak halo against the dark. My legs wobbled beneath me, and my lungs burned with each ragged breath. I stumbled up the porch steps and pounded on the door, my knuckles wrapping against the wood with a frantic rhythm.  

Seconds ticked by like hours before the door cracked open, revealing him—the neighbor I’d only spoken to a handful of times. His face was bleary with sleep, his eyes heavy-lidded. But as he took one look at me, his expression shifted.  

He didn’t just seem startled. He seemed *alarmed*.  

I must’ve looked like a ghost—a pale, wide-eyed specter cloaked in terror. Words sprang to my lips, desperate to explain, but they tangled together in a cacophony of panic. What could I even say? What could possibly make sense of what had just happened?  

“There’s—something—I—” I gasped, clutching the doorframe for support. But the words refused to come out in the right order. How could I explain the impossible? How could I describe *her*—what she’d become, what I’d witnessed?  

He frowned at me, his brow furrowing deeply. “What the hell’s going on? Why are you out here at this hour?” His voice was sharp, layered with confusion and irritation.  

I opened my mouth to answer but stopped myself. What explanation could I give that didn’t make me sound insane?  

“Can I… stay here?” I finally choked out, my voice shaky, almost pleading.  

He squinted at me, clearly annoyed, glancing at the clock on the wall behind him. “It’s *four in the damn morning,*” he grumbled, rubbing a hand down his face. But then he sighed, his frustration melting into something softer. “Come on. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”  

I nodded mutely, stepping inside. Relief washed over me, but it was fleeting. The warmth of his house felt like a fragile barrier, something that wouldn’t hold if she decided to come looking for me.  

He led me to the living room, where a battered recliner sat in front of a coffee table covered in old newspapers and a half-finished puzzle. He shuffled toward the kitchen, muttering something about coffee.  

I collapsed onto the couch, my legs trembling uncontrollably. The room smelled faintly of smoke and yesterday’s dinner, the kind of comfortable, mundane chaos that usually felt grounding. But all it did now was remind me how far from normal my night had gone.  

He returned a moment later with a steaming mug, settling into the recliner across from me. His bleary eyes scanned me over, his disbelief evident. “So,” he started, taking a sip of coffee. “You gonna tell me why you’re limping like that?”  

His tone was casual, almost joking, but the question hung heavily in the air. I opened my mouth and closed it again, my jaw tightening.  

What could I tell him? The truth? That the beautiful woman staying in my house wasn’t a woman at all? That she was something *else*, something that spoke of reclamation and harvests and things I couldn’t even begin to understand? That she wasn’t just *silver* now, but that I’d seen her become something alien, something *wrong*?  

No.  

I couldn’t tell him that. Not without sounding completely insane.  

“I tripped,” I mumbled instead, staring down at the scuffed coffee table.  

He raised an eyebrow but didn’t push. I could tell he didn’t believe me, not entirely, but maybe he figured it wasn’t worth pressing at this ungodly hour. He took another sip of his coffee, leaning back in the recliner.  

For a moment, there was quiet—the hum of his fridge, the faint ticking of a clock in the corner. I wanted to believe I was safe here, that I was far enough away from her. But the image of her silver skin, gleaming in the hallway, burned behind my eyelids.  

I couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t far. That she was still coming.  

And for the first time, I wondered if running had ever been an option at all.

1iau8y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iau8y2/update_there_is_a_weird_guest_in_my_hotel_and_i/,[update] THERE IS A WEIRD GUEST IN MY HOTEL AND I NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT,"[\[FIRST PART\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ia0egw/there_is_a_weird_guest_in_my_hotel_and_i_need_to/)

Hi guys, I just wanted to start this post off by saying thank you for the comments on the last one. I really thought I might have been over exaggerating how weird this guy was. I told my sister about it yesterday as well once she got home and she didn’t think it should have freaked me out as much as it did. She said, “if the worst that happened was a bad phone call, then I think your day went pretty fine OP.” But reading all of your responses being equally weirded out by the guy made me feel a bit less crazy. I mean, today has been... a day. Kind of starting to feel crazy again, but you know, I’ll get into it.

As for if my manager ever updated me on anything the guy did yesterday… No? I mean she did text me about him today, but I’ll talk about that in a second. So I guess after I checked him into his room, he just stayed there all day. 

We have a passdown system here, so basically we have a log where we put all our notes for the day, including things like strange behaviors from guests. Usually it looks something like this:

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - guest had issues using the shower. Work order entered.** 

Or:

**Cops were called on lady in lobby, lady did not have a reservation and refused to leave. She is trespassed, if she shows up again, call cops. \[DESCRIPTION OF GUEST\].**

I think you get the idea. They are usually pretty short and sweet. There really isn’t a need to gum it up with information that doesn’t really matter. I was reading the passdowns from our overnight girl this morning though and it was a bit longer than her usual entries. I copied it here for you guys (a bit redacted, sorry, privacy policy stuff):

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] was in the lobby for a while last night. I asked if he needed help for anything but he said he was fine. I asked for his room number to make sure he was staying with us (he is). Called \[SECURITY GUARDS NAME\] and asked him to stand up at the desk with me. Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] went back to his room once \[SECURITY GUARD\] got here. Got a call from his room too, but I think his phone is broken. (\[OP\], can you have \[MAINTENANCE\] check it out in the morning?).** 

I read it after she clocked out so I wasn’t able to ask her more about the phone thing, like if she felt the weird breathing thing that I did yesterday. 

There weren’t any other notes about him in our passdowns, but one of my housekeeping girls today did text me saying that when she went to give him room service he was really weird. The thing about that is, the room has to be vacated for someone to do housekeeping. It's a safety policy thing. It’s been a while since I’ve read it, but basically it’s for the safety of our housekeepers. Well, Mr. Weird was in the room while she was cleaning. 

I’ll copy our texts here so you can see what she had to deal with. (Also, sorry but another note here. She doesn’t speak English, and I don’t speak Spanish, so our texts back and forth can read a little weird. We are just doing rounds of google translate to the other person's language and it doesn’t always go well.)

\[Housekeeper\] - Our guest in \[ROOM NUMBER\] is strange.

\[Me\]                 - Yes! I noticed yesterday at check in! How did he behave with you?

\[Housekeeper\] - He is standing in the room as I cleaned. He watched me as I cleaned.

\[Me\]                 - Ew! I’m so sorry! \[long apology about the situation\] He didn’t do anything else 

though? Just looked?

\[Housekeeper\] - He only looked as I cleaned. 

\[Me\]                 - I’m so sorry. 

\[Housekeeper\] - It is okay! I won’t enter that room again.

Then a bit of time passed, maybe 5 minutes?

\[Housekeeper\] - Can I tell you something about \[ROOM NUMBER\]? 

\[Me\]                 - Yes

\[Housekeeper\] - I left his room and I hear him talking. He sounds behind me. 

\[Me\]                 - He sounds like he is standing behind you?

\[Housekeeper\] - yes

\[Me\]                 - Do not go near his room again. 

\[Housekeeper\] - ok

I’m pretty sure she got an early lunch, and my housekeeping manager came down to talk to me about it. I told her what I knew, which isn’t a lot. That, apparently, he had requested housekeeping (but I really can’t find any notes about this literally anywhere), she had gone to the room and entered, then texted me that he was in the room when she was cleaning. I want to double down that the housekeeper that went in is 100% not the type to do that. All the housekeepers know not to go in the room if someone is in there, but her especially. So now I’m thinking, like, what did he say or do to get her in the room? 

The housekeeping manager said something about going up to tell him we would not be cleaning the room if he was in it, but he’s set to check out tomorrow so it shouldn’t be a big deal. I just told her we shouldn’t send anyone up to that room alone, but she thinks I’m being a bit dramatic about it. But I never got a message from her saying she went up there to tell him anything so maybe she decided against it. 

So about my manager's text. She sent it to me like halfway through my shift (it was actually during my lunch break), and it’s not all that weird on its own but, you know. In addition to everything else, it's pretty weird. She texted me and asked if he’d called the desk again. And obviously I was confused because she didn’t have anything in her notes about him being weird and calling the desk. I’ll copy these messages as well for you:

\[Manager\] - Did \[ROOM NUMBER\] call the desk again today?

\[Me\]          - Not yet. Why?

\[Manager\] - He kept calling last night, and I know he called during \[OVERNIGHT GIRL\]’s shift 

too. 

\[Me\]          - Oh, well he hasn’t called again. 

\[Me\]          - Did he say anything weird?

\[Manager\] - On the phone?

\[Me\]          - Yeah

\[Manager\] - No, I think the phone in that room is broken.

\[Me\]          - Did he say anything on the phone?

\[Manager\] - No, I think it’s the phone in that room. We just need to go in and change it. I texted 

\[MAINTENANCE\] about it and he said he would check it out. 

\[Me\]          - I’m going to tell him not to enter the room if the guest is in there. \[GUEST NAME\] 

really creeped me out last night, and \[HOUSEKEEPER\] too this morning. 

\[Manager\] - Just let me know if \[MAINTENANCE\] can fix the phone when he’s done. Text me if 

anything weird happens. 

I mean guys, I don’t know but this phone thing is really bothering me. Like really really bothering me because I checked the call logs and he called the front desk like 32 times. It looked like twice an hour every hour from around 3pm ish till 6am ish. That is crazy right?? I’m not crazy for thinking that's crazy? No one tried to call back and tell him to stop? No one went up to the room to tell him to stop? Because there is no way that 32 times is an issue with the phone. I mean unless some techy person on here can tell me some super obscure way that causes phones to call one specific number over and over again like that. I don’t know, I feel like it's really weird. 

Anyway, this is the most exciting part. I’m sorry it took so long, these other things were just a bit too weird to not include them. I saw him again. 

So I was going back to the kitchen to refill the coffee, and it was like almost the end of my shift so I was sort of losing hope that I was going to see him today. So I fill the little coffee container, and walk back up to the desk, and turn the corner. Who do I see? Mr. Weird standing right in front of the coffee station.

He wasn’t making coffee or anything, just looking at it. So I walked up beside him and tried to talk to him. Kind of went something like this. 

“Hello Mr. \[LAST NAME\], do you mind moving over just a bit so I can set down some fresh coffee for you?”

“Fresh?” Which is the first question I’ve heard him ask. Yesterday when he came to make the reservation to begin with he just said ‘I need a room’ or something like that. I don’t know, maybe I’m reading into it too much. 

“Yes Mr. \[LAST NAME\]. I just roasted a new pot of coffee, so I just went to the back to refill it here.”

And this whole time I was trying to like, observe him without making it obvious. A couple of comments yesterday made me think that I should like, maybe try to see if there is something off about him, looks wise. 

So another baby interlude here, when you are behind the desk and helping someone out, it's hard to fully realize the scope of how tall someone is. There's just space between you, so it makes a height difference seem less intense. I don’t know the science or psychology behind it, just know that's how it feels.

So I walk up to the guy, try to get him to scooch over while also trying to see if he looks ‘off’ somehow, and suddenly I notice that he’s like Really Tall. I’m not that short either. I mean, I’m only 5’8 but this guy is dwarfing me. Not like, “he’s 6ft omg!” but like, “This is freakishly tall and I have no idea how I didn’t notice yesterday” kind of tall. I don’t think it helps that he was standing so straight, like he had a rod up his back or something. It was freaky. 

And then, he looked at me, which he was not doing before and I fucking felt his eyes in my skin again. I’m sorry, I tried to keep cursing out of the post, mostly because it’s not really necessary but oh my god. I swear, I could feel his eyes in my skin. 

I… I really don’t know what else to say. I don’t know how to describe it. He was just… Looking At Me. Staring at me. I really don’t even have words close enough for how it felt when he looked at me. I felt so bad, did my housekeeper feel like this? Like, guys, did I somehow, inadvertently, send my poor housekeeper into this fucking guy’s room???? Because this staring is just… it feels awful. I feel awful. Like sick or something I don’t know. Like when you are so anxious you start to feel sick, even if nothing is really happening. That’s kind of, a little bit like what being watched by this guy felt like. Sort of. 

The really unfortunate thing is that his… fucking staring, god christ it was awful, sort of distracted me from trying to notice much else about him. I know I had mentioned in one comment that I would try to see if he looked as normal as I remember him and I really couldn’t tell you. I kind of felt… frozen. Or maybe more, paused? Like I couldn’t get myself to move. I don’t know. It’s really hard to describe. Maybe it’s just fight or flight (or freeze). 

Anyway, he stopped looking at me eventually. I set up the coffee for him, and like, apologized for staring (I kind of was staring at him), then went to hide in the back office. 

Saying I was recovering from him staring at me sounds a little stupid, but hey that's what I was doing. So I sat in the back and watched on the camera monitor. I’ll do that sometimes if I’m really not in the mood to be at the desk or if it's really slow. 

Well anyway, there he was on the camera. Standing in front of the coffee station, the funny thing is, he did not look as tall as he felt. He looked tall but not freakishly tall. Maybe my anxiety was warping the height in my brain or something. 

There really isn’t much more to tell you from there that isn’t the same as yesterday. I was looking at the camera, there was some camera fuzz, I looked under the desk to try and see if something wasn’t plugged in properly, and by the time I looked up, the guy was gone. The coffee station was messed up too. Like, coffee all over the table, coffee cups half filled, sugar packets kind of, everywhere. A huge mess that I had to clean in the last like, 30 minutes of my shift. So that’s cool. 

I looked back in the camera recordings again for when he was in the lobby before I hid in the back. It sort of just looked like we were having a staring contest when he was looking at me. He didn’t… move or anything. I kinda didn’t either. Looking at it from that perspective kind of tripped me out, I don’t know. On the camera it sort of looks pretty normal. Apart from having a staring contest. 

I didn’t tell my manager about it, I just wanted to get home and type this all up so I can get it off my chest. I also told the agent following me to text me if literally anything weird happened with him. Anything at all. Hopefully he doesn’t freak her out. 

Also a couple of notes for some of the comments. 

1. The only thing reported missing was a set of car keys that ended up being found later in the guest's room. I also didn’t notice anything missing from the desk, and housekeeping didn’t mention anything missing either. 

2. The only other ‘disappearing act’ situation that happened with him today (so far) was him being in the lobby and then being gone, but that could have been the camera malfunctioning, and also I was away from the desk to fill the coffee containers so he could have just walked up like normal.

3. I haven’t rewatched the ‘men in black’ episode of unsolved mysteries/buzzfeed unsolved yet. Felt like just coming home, changing into pajamas, and watching tiktoks in bed for a bit. 



Again, if any other front desk agents or anyone has dealt with this guy or someone like him, some help or advice would be really appreciated. He should be checking out tomorrow so I will update you if anything happens at that time. Hopefully not though.

Hi, I'm a 35 year-old nerdy guy living in New England. And yes, I made a dating site for myself.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

I want to replace the cabinet at the back wall with something that can serve the purpose of coffee bar, traditional bar, and storage. I’m thinking about the [IKEA Skruvby](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skruvby-sideboard-black-blue-70568720/) to do that and hold mugs and specialty glasses, which should open some overhead cabinet space for dry goods.

Are you tired of hiding your smile because of stubborn tooth stains? Many people struggle with discolored teeth that can make them feel self-conscious and reluctant to show off their pearly whites. The good news is that teeth whitening has become an increasingly popular solution for those seeking to restore their smile's natural brightness. Whether you're dealing with coffee stains, years of smoking, or just natural discoloration, professional teeth whitening treatments can effectively address various types of tooth stains and help you regain your confidence.

Understanding Tooth Stains and Whitening Options

Different Types of Tooth Stains

Not all tooth stains are created equal. There are primarily two types of dental stains:

1. Extrinsic Stains
- Surface-level stains caused by external factors
- Typically from:
  - Coffee and tea
  - Red wine
  - Smoking
  - Certain foods

2. Intrinsic Stains
- Stains that occur beneath the tooth's surface
- Caused by:
  - Aging
  - Medication
  - Tooth trauma
  - Excessive fluoride exposure

How Teeth Whitening Removes Stains

Teeth whitening works through a scientific process that targets both extrinsic and intrinsic stains. **Hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide** are the primary active ingredients that break down stain molecules. These powerful bleaching agents penetrate the tooth enamel, effectively dissolving and removing discoloration.

Professional Whitening Methods

1. In-Office Professional Whitening
- Most effective and fastest method

Effectiveness of Teeth Whitening on Different Stains

Extrinsic Stain Removal
Most teeth whitening treatments are highly effective at removing surface-level stains. **Professional whitening can eliminate 80-90% of external stains**, making your teeth significantly brighter and cleaner-looking.

Intrinsic Stain Challenges
While professional treatments can improve intrinsic stains, results may vary. Some deep-set stains might require multiple treatments or alternative cosmetic dental procedures.

Research Insights
According to a study published in the Journal of Dentistry, professional teeth whitening treatments showed:
- 87% patient satisfaction
- Average tooth shade improvement of 5-7 levels
- Long-lasting results with proper maintenance

So, here’s the backstory: My husband (30, M) and I (37, M)  at the time, made the move to upstate New York 4 years ago for his Army assignment. When we got there, he was an E4 Specialist in the Army, and we were still getting settled in. Things were fine, but I hadn’t really found my people yet. It’s a small town, and let's just say the locals weren’t exactly welcoming to two queer brown men like us. Plus, the Army wives? Yeah, they can be pretty cliquey.

Then, in late November, we met Sergeant DeGeneres (34, F), who transferred into my husband’s unit. She and my husband immediately hit it off. She invited us to hang out with her and her wife, Portia (29, F). Now, a bit about DeGeneres: she has a kid with an ex, but she doesn’t see the child much due to a custody thing. From what she told us, she still pays child support and occasionally does video calls. Trust me, this little tidbit becomes important later on.

Just a quick side note for non-military folks: at the E4 level, there are two ranks—Specialist and Corporal. Corporal is just a lateral promotion from Specialist. And anyone above E4, like Corporals and Sergeants, are considered Non-commissioned Officers (NCOs). NCOs have a strict code they have to follow—things like how to behave around lower ranks, what’s acceptable, and what happens if they screw up. They also have to keep an eye on lower enlisted folks, almost like mentors. So keep that in mind as you read.

Anyway, my husband was pumped about the possibility of us making friends with DeGeneres and Portia. Having queer friends to hang out with would mean we could actually be ourselves without worrying about judgment. The weekend arrives, and we all have an amazing time. My husband, of course, sees this as the perfect opportunity to push us to become regular friends with them. At first, DeGeneres and Portia were super chill, and they were just what we needed. So, naturally, we started hanging out with them a lot more after that.

The issue began in December when DeGeneres confided in my husband about problems with her pay. She hadn't been paid since arriving in New York because of a clerical error on the Army’s part. The base she had left didn’t file her transfer correctly, so the new base couldn’t process her pay until the issue was resolved. She was struggling financially—falling behind on rent, car payments, and insurance—and was using up what little savings she and her wife, Portia, had just for essentials like food and gas. DeGeneres even showed my husband screenshots of emails from her housing office threatening eviction unless she made a payment. Desperate, she asked my husband for a loan. My husband discussed it with me, as we follow the ""two yes, one no"" rule for decisions. After talking it over, we decided to offer her a one-time loan of $500, to be repaid once her pay issue was sorted. DeGeneres accepted, and we sent her the money via Cash App.

Three days later, DeGeneres came back to my husband, asking for another $500, this time in person. She repeated that she would pay us back once the pay issue was cleared up. My husband and I agreed to lend her the money, but I asked him to confirm with her via text that she intended to repay this second loan. She agreed, and we sent her the money. I also asked my husband to screenshot their text conversation and the Cash App receipts for our records. Always moving in the shadows, just in case. I didn’t think much of it at the time but wanted to be cautious.  Sometimes things get worse before they get better in financial situations.

Over the following year, DeGeneres and Portia continued making excuses about why they couldn’t repay us. They claimed things like “We’re saving for a trip,” “We need to treat our pets for flees,” and “We always budget $80 a month for Pokémon Go.” These excuses grew frustrating and insulting, especially considering how much money they were borrowing. As DeGeneres had started making smaller requests for additional money, such as for gas or to buy drinks at cookouts, even though we had been contributing food for those gatherings. At first, we thought these were just temporary struggles due to the Army’s error, but we soon learned that DeGeneres and Portia were living beyond their means and had poor financial management. By this point, their debt to us had reached $1,500. I told my husband that I didn’t want to lend them any more money and that we should insist on repayment before we moved in 6 months. I made it clear that I didn’t want to keep enabling them.  Hubby agreed but by this point, DeGeneres had been made my husband’s immediate supervisor and fearing possible retaliation, we decided I’d be the one to confront them.

In mid-September, I sent a message in our group chat, which included my husband, me, DeGeneres, and Portia. I said, “Now that you’re back from your trip to see DeGeneres’s family, we want to talk about the loans. They total $1,500, according to our Cash App records. We’re moving in a little over 6 months, and we’d like to have this paid off before then so we can use that money for our own move.”

DeGeneres replied, “You’ll get my tax return. Portia’s hours were cut, and we’re paycheck to paycheck again. Giving you my tax return is the only way we can pay you back.” Portia chimed in with a simple “?” which led me to believe she wasn’t fully aware of the debt. After discussing it, my husband and I agreed to wait until tax season for repayment. After that, DeGeneres started distancing herself from me, although she continued to be friendly with my husband.

At this time, we also learned that DeGeneres had begun the process of terminating her parental rights to her son, which would free up more money for her and Portia. However, this process dragged on, and to my knowledge, it still hasn’t been finalized. Despite that, DeGeneres continued asking my husband for more money, which we refused. I made it clear that any further requests should go through me, not him. This refusal led DeGeneres to start criticizing me to my husband, even attempting to convince him that I was a narcissist and financially abusing him by not allowing him to give her more money, at her own promotion ceremony to Staff Sergeant! My husband didn’t engage with her, simply relaying the conversations to me afterward.

Around the same time, I confided in a military spouse friend, Kat, whose husband was stationed nearby. Kat and her husband, Sergeant First Class Foster, introduced us to another couple, Regina and Sergeant First Class Hanks. Over coffee, I shared the full story of DeGeneres and Portia’s behavior, and Foster and Hanks suggested that we take the issue to the chain of command. They pointed out that DeGeneres’s actions not only violated ethical standards but could also be considered a form of financial exploitation, especially given her position in the military. After discussing it with my husband, we decided to wait until tax season before taking further steps.

In mid-January, DeGeneres messaged my husband, saying, “Once the child support is canceled and no longer taken out of my check, I will send you $200 a month until I pay off what you lent me. I was going to use my tax return, but I want to pay off a bill instead to have fewer payments. I haven’t forgotten to pay you, I just needed the child support to stop and for Portia’s checks to stabilize.”

My husband and I crafted a response together, saying we’d discuss it and get back to her. I then wrote a firm message expressing how hurt and betrayed we felt by the lies and excuses, and we told them that this was their final chance to repay us in full. If not, we’d report them to the chain of command and consider legal action. I didn’t send it right away because I wanted to wait until my husband was awake to review it, but there was a last minute change to his schedule and he wouldn’t be able to review it before going into work the following day. 

That following day, DeGeneres barged into the office my hubby shared with a few others, angrily telling him, “If u/OsoSabroso doesn’t like the changes to the deal, you tell him he can kiss my ass.” My husband remained calm and simply said “no,” though he was visibly upset when he relayed this to me at dinner that night.

We decided enough was enough and arranged to meet with the company commander. We scheduled an appointment and prepared with a dossier of evidence and transaction records. At the meeting, the commander was disappointed in DeGeneres and reassured us that he would work to get us our money back. In the following days, my husband was asked to provide a sworn statement. The commander also requested that I submit my own statement. As we were in the process of this, my hubby was asked if we knew of any other soldiers DeGeneres might have taken advantage of. This is where the commander and I learned from hubby that other soldiers had been taken advantage of by DeGeneres. These soldiers had asked my hubby to keep their confessions confidential because they too feared retaliation, but my husband passed along the information to the chain of command. The commander took it seriously and assured us he would work on getting our money back before we moved.

There were two complications: 1- DeGeneres was on medical leave and couldn’t be disciplined until she returned to duty. 2- Her leave was extended into early March, which was cutting it close to our planned move in mid-March.

Around this time, my husband was promoted to E5, and he asked me to pin him at the promotion ceremony. DeGeneres, who had been eagerly awaiting to pin him, was going to be furious when she found out. She had tried convincing him for months that she should be the one to pin him, probably in an attempt to love bomb and ingratiate herself on him. But by this time her honeyed words smelled like bullshit to both of us.  A few days after the ceremony, DeGeneres returned from her medical leave and she learned of my husband’s ceremony without her, she sent him angry texts, which I told him to ignore. I responded to her by explaining that I had limited contact with her due to her rude outburst in January and that my husband had chosen to prioritize my comfort by not inviting her. This made her even more upset.

While DeGeneres was angrily texting my husband and I, the commander, facility manager, and others in the chain of command found her, and pulled her into a private room to talk. She was handed a copy of all the proof we had printed out and I’m told by someone who was present in the room that the color drained from her face as she flipped through the pages and read the text messages and corresponding Cash App transactions. She tried to make excuses, promising to repay us all while ugly crying. The commander informed her that she had until the day we moved to repay us in full, or she would face severe consequences, including loss of rank and possibly being expelled from the military. He also told her that even if she did pay us back, the report would remain in her personnel file, which could jeopardize any future promotions.  That last point is what I assume broke her, because after concluding the meeting with DeGeneres the Company Commander called my husband.  Apparently in a last-ditch effort to save her ass, DeGeneres told the Commander that I was a narcissist and was financially abusing my hubby, and the Commander had to follow up on the allegation of abuse. I was with my husband as we were packing at the time when he took the call, he laughed and called bullshit on her claims. Hubby assured the Commander he felt safe at home and the only abuser was DeGeneres, the Commander thanked hubby and let him know to expect repayment by the day we leave.  

At this point we only have a few days left in NY and we’re patiently waiting to be paid as we finish arranging our move. The day before we hit the road, one of the command team that was present at the meeting with DeGeneres, asked to meet up with hubby and I for coffee. We meet with them at a local coffee shop, and we make small talk. Really nothing of any consequence was discussed until I was answering one of their questions, and the command member reached into their coat pocket and pulls out a blank envelope filled with cash and places it on the table and slides it across to my hubby and I, like we’re making a shady back-room drug deal. I trail off as I glance over at my husband, and he’s glancing over at me. I stutter and ask, “Is that from DeGeneres?” The command member replies “Yes and no. It is the sum of money she owes you but it’s not from her. It’s from me. I can’t discuss any more of the details of what happened that day with you, but DeGeneres heavily implied that paying you back in such a short amount of time would cause a lot of hardships for her and her wife. Realistically, I doubt she’ll be paying you tomorrow, if ever. I discussed this with my spouse, and we don’t believe you two should be punished for doing the right thing and helping someone in need. We can afford to give this amount to you. I only ask that you report to the commander that DeGeneres’s debt was paid in full.” I asked for a moment to talk it over with my husband and the command member gave us a few minutes alone. Ultimately my husband and I decided to refuse the money the command member was presenting to us. We could have played it safe, but as much as we were doing this to get even and our money back, we were doing it to protect other lower enlisted from the disgusting behavior being displayed by DeGeneres too. Accepting the money would be protecting her and letting her off the hook. We didn’t want that. DeGeneres is a predator, taking advantage of lower enlisted soldiers who may not know their rights in the army. We thanked them for their offer and left shortly after to continue our preparations.

The following day, we started our long road trip to my husband’s new installation. We had been on the road for a few hours, when my husband got a notification on his phone, it was a Cash App transaction, from DeGeneres. Surprisingly she paid us the full amount she owed; I can’t tell you just how shocked I was when my husband told me that. I swear my jaw must have been open and on the floor of my car for at least 5 miles before I came to my senses and told hubby to call the Company Commander and let him know we had been paid. That really put us in a great mood for the rest of the road trip, to have dealt some much-deserved justice to the villain of our story, especially after enduring the dozen or so bullshit excuses DeGeneres had given us over the past year.

The first few weeks at the new duty station were busy with unpacking, organizing and my husband checking into his new assigned installation. But we did make the time to call a few of hubby’s former coworkers and friends in New York. According to many of them, DeGeneres was miserable, and ***I love that for her***. DeGeneres claimed to miss my hubby but puts all the blame on me, because like the narcissist I believe she is, she can’t imagine that she didn’t always have my hubby under her thumb. **She can die mad.** In addition to the consequences I had already mentioned, she was ordered to stop any non-work-related communication with anyone E4 or below, she was also ordered to remove any lower enlisted member from her personal social media friends list. DeGeneres is incredibly mopey and low energy around the facility they work in everyday or irrationally pissed off, there is no in between. DeGeneres had to use Portia’s entire paycheck to repay us, so DeGeneres is in hot water with her own wife.

We've lived at the new duty station for 2 years now, we're settled into our routines, have family nearby and lots of real friends.  We occasionally speak to hubby's friends still stationed in New York and we have updates. Unfortunately Portia is still with DeGeneres, I had hoped that the situation ending as badly as it did would have opened her eyes but no luck.  DeGeneres has been medically discharged from the Army due to the  injury she had surgery for, earlier in the post. The shift to the civilian world has been very bumpy  financially for DeGeneres and Portia and they've been reaching out to people DeGeneres worked with for help, those who know about the drama won't help her and they've been kind enough to let new arrivals to that unit know not to give them a single cent either.  Some people never learn, but she's someone else's monkey now and out of our circus.",14,1737934723.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False
1iatza9,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1iatza9/the_last_millennial/,"""The Last Millennial""","By 2074, society buzzed with the energy of Generation Omega, the latest and most dynamic of the generational labels. They were innovators, dreamers, and trailblazers, shaped by a world where holograms were as tangible as physical objects, AI coexisted as near-equal partners, and Mars was no longer a distant red dot but a bustling colony. To them, Generation Alpha was passé, Generation Beta was quaint, and Millennials—well, they were ancient history.

Sitting on the porch of his modest smart home in what used to be Austin, Texas, 86-year-old Jordan Williams adjusted his augmented reality glasses, which had become more of a necessity than a convenience. His hand trembled slightly as he fiddled with the settings to tune into the latest hypercast—a 360-degree sensory stream that young people consumed like candy. He winced as the fast-paced, neon-drenched visuals overwhelmed him. With a muttered “Too much,” he shut it off.

“Can’t believe people call this entertainment,” Jordan grumbled, his voice raspy with age. “Back in my day, we had streaming services. Netflix and chill. None of this… sensory overload.”

His grandson, Milo, a sleek, carefree 20-year-old Omega with silver-dyed hair and a neural implant, walked out of the house. “Grandpa, you can’t keep living in the past. If you don’t adapt, you’re gonna fall behind even more.”

Jordan raised a bushy white eyebrow. “Fall behind? Kid, I’ve been behind since 2045. I’m not trying to catch up anymore. Just trying to keep up enough to not get locked out of my bank account.”

Milo chuckled. “You know, if you let me upload your consciousness to the cloud, you wouldn’t have to worry about that. You’d be a data-being, like Uncle Liam.”

Jordan rolled his eyes. “I’m not turning myself into some algorithm. I lived a full life. Flesh and blood. I don’t want to end up as a file in some server farm in Antarctica.”

Milo shrugged. “Suit yourself. But you’re the last Millennial who hasn’t upgraded. The others figured it out.”

Jordan sighed and leaned back in his chair, gazing out at the shimmering skyline, where drone highways intersected above a city that barely resembled the one he’d grown up in. A holographic ad materialized in the air before him, showcasing a young Omega couple laughing as they explored a virtual rainforest. The tagline read: “Don’t just live your life. Recreate it. *Virtually Yours*.”

He turned his face away. Ads weren’t supposed to target seniors anymore, but every now and then, they slipped through. The implication was clear: he and his generation were irrelevant.

Millennials had once been the voice of progress. They were the creators of meme culture, the masters of Twitter wars, the architects of streaming platforms and influencers who had reshaped modern fame. They were the first to grow up with the internet and the last to remember life without it. But that time was long gone.

Now, Millennials were the old guard. The Boomers and Gen X had been gone for decades. Gen Z had aged into retirement homes that were probably named something cringe like ""TikTok Manor"" or ""Snapchat Springs."" And Millennials? They shuffled around the periphery of society, their digital legacy all but consumed by the ever-evolving demands of Generations Alpha, Beta, and Omega.

Jordan’s greatest frustration was the loss of cultural dominance. He missed the days when Millennials were the arbiters of cool, the ones who shaped trends, created viral moments, and argued over pineapple on pizza like it actually mattered. Now, every cultural reference he made was met with blank stares or polite chuckles from the younger generations.

“Hey, Milo,” Jordan called out as his grandson prepared to leave. “Do you even know what Vine was?”

Milo frowned, his neural implant blinking blue as he accessed the cloud for an answer. “Yeah, it was like… super short videos, right? Kind of like a proto-hypercast? That was your thing?”

“*Our thing*?” Jordan scoffed. “It was revolutionary! We paved the way for all this nonsense you kids love. You’re welcome.”

“Right…” Milo smirked. “Well, thanks, Grandpa. But, uh, nobody cares about six-second videos anymore. It’s all about immersive storytelling now. Catch up, will ya?”

That evening, Jordan sat alone, flipping through a digital scrapbook on his glasses. Photos of his younger self at protests, memes he’d made during the early 2020s, screenshots of Twitter threads he’d once thought profound. He chuckled bitterly. It was like looking at an ancient relic.

“Why does it feel like we mattered more back then?” he muttered.

The truth was, they *did* matter more. Millennials had been the last generation to grow up believing they could change the world before the world outpaced them. Climate change, automation, the colonization of space—these had all been dreams and nightmares for his generation. For Generation Omega, they were facts of life.

The next day, Jordan ventured into town, a rarity for him. Most seniors stayed home, their needs met by delivery drones and caregiving robots. But Jordan craved real human connection. He shuffled into a coffee shop, its sleek interior filled with young Omegas tapping away on neural interfaces or chatting with AI companions.

He ordered a latte—“extra foam, like in the old days”—and sat near a group of teenagers who were laughing about some viral hypercast. When they noticed him staring, one of them, a girl with bright green cybernetic eyes, turned to him.

“Excuse me, sir. Are you okay?”

Jordan smiled. “Just reminiscing. You kids ever hear of a show called *The Office*?”

The group exchanged glances. One boy spoke up. “I think my great-grandparents mentioned it once. It’s, like, old-school, right? Laugh tracks and stuff?”

Jordan’s smile faltered. “No, no laugh tracks. Just… never mind.”

As they returned to their conversation, Jordan sipped his latte and gazed out the window. He realized something: every generation feels invincible when it’s their turn. But the spotlight doesn’t last forever. Millennials had had their time, and it was okay to let go.

For the first time in years, he felt a strange peace. He might not understand the world anymore, but he’d left his mark, even if the Omegas didn’t see it. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.

After recently getting to experience the joys of downtown coffee life in for a couple of days in Seattle WA, coming back to the 8 dollar cup of ice that is caribou is largely disappointing and am looking to upgradey home coffee game. Will probably be used 1 or 2 times daily and prefer lighter roasted beans. We mainly make milk/creme based drinks. Looking to spend a max of 1000$ between the two devices. 

Firstly I am looking for an espresso grinder as the moka pot does a decent job but espresso selection is otherwise terrible. 

I've come across the baratza encore esp at around 200 which seems to be one of the more popular starting points in the espresso game. But wouldnt mind spend more for some extra headroom and not buying another one.

As for the espresso machine itself down the line me and the lady largely do milk based drinks so a decent brother would be nice. When I looked at machines a few years back it seems the pressure(bar)was a lot more of an issue, but I don't see that being advertised as much in the searching I have done. 

The gaggia e24 with the brass boiler seems neat but I don't know how much the new brass boiler changes anything or if other companies are doing the same thing at that price point.

And it’s not just about traveling—it’s all over the internet, too. It feels like every time someone does something dumb, they’re automatically labeled as “an American,” whether they are or not. Americans get dragged for things that don’t even happen, like, “Why don’t Americans have self-checkout?” or “Why isn’t school mandatory in America?” or “Why do Americans drink gallons of milk in one sitting?” But if I ask something like, “Why do Europeans drink so much coffee every day?” I’m immediately called a “dumb American.” It seems America in constantly scruntized by lots of Europeans and Aussies while South Americans, North Americans, and Asians don't really constantly hate on other countries just to hate

1iatxjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iatxjo/i_taught_myself_to_lucid_dream_but_now_i_cant/,"I taught myself to lucid dream, but now I can't make it stop.","I didn’t always have the ability to lucid dream. When I was younger, I used to do all these rituals while awake to try and encourage my awareness of reality. I’d hold my hands out in front of me and count how many fingers were on each one, I’d look at the time and ask myself if it made sense, I’d observe my surroundings and check the books I stacked in a specific pattern were all in order. I even took to drinking strange teas, brewed from exotic leaves I’d purchased online, even if the taste made it difficult to finish. Nevertheless, it was only when I got tired of trying and abandoned this phase that I began to experience consciousness in my dreams.

  
  


At the beginning, I was elated to have unlocked this superpower. I’d compulsively record the events in my previously neglected dream journal, detailing every path I chose, person I chose to see and place I visited. I’d conclude each entry with a paragraph of lines, the words ‘*tonight, I’ll lucid dream again*’, written over and over to manifest more. When I obsessed over it however, it wouldn’t happen. It was only when I forgot about it that I’d stop what I was doing, sensing some strangeness around me, count my fingers and find six on one hand.

  
  


One of my favourite dreams, over a year ago now, I was at work in the cafe as always when I got a strange compulsion to look at my hands. It was a terrible shift, everything had been going wrong and each customer seemed to be looking at me. As I suspected, my hands were completely deformed before my eyes. I let out an exhale in a mixture of amusement at the sight and relief that I was in a dream again. As soon as I’d figured it out, I halted my breath and composed myself. I’d long since learned to conceal my awareness from the characters in my head. I had no reason to believe anything bad would happen if I said aloud that I was asleep, but there was an instinctive fear within me of letting anything find out.

  
  


After my strange display of checking my hands and sighing, my colleague, Eloise, gave me a tense look. I didn’t like the way she looked at me. Her eyes met mine and her expression changed, her head tilting forward slowly, so that she was looking at me from the corner of her eye.

  
  


“Andrea?” She drawled out.

  
  


“Nothing, nothing,” I exclaimed, waving my hands frantically, before she’d even said anything. “None of this matters, anyway.”

  
  


She didn’t seem to like that, opening her mouth to say something, but I shut my eyes and began to spin around. Just as I’d willed it to, the room was different when I opened my eyes. No more strange customers, no colleagues, just me and the ex-boyfriend I’d been madly obsessed with. For my own dignity, I’ll call him something similar, like ‘Miles’. My fanaticism over a relationship that ended isn’t something I like to share, but in my defence, our one-sided relationship was something I only ever planned to keep in my dreams.

  
  


Miles was a frequent visitor of my lucid dreams, at my request of course. In this dream, I served him a coffee and whispered that I was a fan of his work in music. I did my best to be respectful and secretive as to not blow his cover in public, even though we were completely alone. In my dreams he’d always become the famous singer he’d dreamed of being himself. It seemed to make sense in the storyline I’d like to create. He was as gracious as ever, expressing his thanks and then offering for me to join him for a drink, as though he’d forgotten me and we were strangers again.

  
  


“I can’t,” I said, smiling at him with as much charm as I could muster. “I’m still working.”

  
  


He looked around the cafe and motioned to the lack of customers, allowing me to admire the flawless beauty of his side profile. “I don’t see any customers.” He said, a mischievous tone to his voice as he rested his chin in his hands.

  
  


A little caught off guard, I looked around also. “Right, yeah,” I mumbled. “I didn’t think you’d be aware of that.”

  
  


“You didn’t think I’d know we’re alone?” He said, tilting his head.

  
  


I sat down opposite him, swooning. “No, no, I mean-- I don’t know.” I said, fumbling over my words. What I’d meant to say was that I didn’t think he’d be as aware of our surroundings within the dream as I was. After all, he was merely a character created by me, how was I to know he transcended the logic of dreams? The situations and the rules I produced seemed to occasionally flicker out of my control.

  
  


I held out a hand. “My name’s Andrea.”

  
  


“That’s a beautiful name.”

  
  


We proceeded to have a lovely conversation over coffee that we never seemed to drink, before he invited me to ditch my work and head out with him. My memory of the dream became foggy after we left, but I recall seeing a few old friends out in town that I smugly ignored in favour of gazing only at Miles. At some points, his hair and clothes seemed to change a little, much to my frustration, but I knew the dream was simply becoming unstable and that I was waking up soon. Whenever I noticed, I’d reach up to adjust his hair, muttering to myself that he wasn’t holding together. He’d flush at my touch and smile, like I was doing something romantic for him.

  
  


Knowing I had very little time left, I began to rush us home to get out of the public eye. Alone, I remember that he kissed me, that amongst the fog of a collapsing dream, it was the last and yet most vivid, intense moment. A kiss within a dream was my favourite feeling. Every sense, every cell in my body, seemed hyper-tuned to the moment. There was a warmness in my chest and a softness to his lips that reality just couldn’t replicate. Not that it ever would.

  
  


I remember awakening from these types of dreams with a euphoria that had me snuggling back into my duvet, trying to pull the dream back to me. I’d roll out of bed and think about different frames of the movie I’d made, reliving the feeling of him looking at me. With my morning coffee, I’d fill my dream journal with the story.

  
  


I tried to recall the start of the dream, before I’d become lucid. I’d been at work, doing my job as always, so what had tipped me off that it was a dream? The shift was going badly, sure, but that happened in reality every now and then, so why had something felt so wrong? The only thing that stood out to me was Eloise’s face. She’d given me an odd look and there was something about her face that was unnatural and wrong. But it was only once the cover was blown, once I’d counted my fingers, that I realised she wasn’t right.

  
  


It was an entire month after that before I became lucid again. During the next time, I was walking around a shopping centre with a few friends, old friends again. I seemed to revisit the past often when in my subconscious.

  
  


We stopped by a fountain when things escalated in our conversation. I don’t remember what we were talking about, the group hollering angrily about something that felt important in the moment, but it was when Lydia addressed me that I realised.

  
  


“Don’t you have any remorse, Andrea?” Was what she asked me, outraged.

  
  


Time seemed to slow to a stop, gears in my head shuddering to a rusty halt. “Oh.” I said, and I looked at my hands, the only living things in my fabricated surroundings. I had far too many fingers.

  
  


I laughed, freely. I was once again standing in the midst of my own creation, like a mad inventor. I turned around the survey the place, but when I looked back at Lydia, my joy was sapped away.

  
  


Her face had changed. It was still her, but her hair had thinned out and turned dull, her jaw was unnaturally wide, like the blood and fat from her face had drained and her skin had been vacuum-packed to her bones.

  
  


“Don’t do that.” She said, hauntingly. She began to slowly shake her head.

  
  


I felt myself frowning, confused by this tonal shift. I wasn’t sure what it was, but everything was frightening all of a sudden, dread weighing down on me like a weighted blanket. I turned to my other old friends, who stood, dazed, in my peripheral. When I tried to look at them directly however, they were gone.

  
  


I told myself I had no reason to be afraid, this was *my* dream after all. I closed my eyes and snapped my fingers in her unsettling face to make her disappear, but she wouldn’t. When I opened my eyes, she still stood before me, eyes sinking into her increasingly grey face.

  
  


“You’re not Lydia.” I said, slowly. When I’d said it, I meant that she simply wasn’t real, but she started smiling. It was as though she agreed with me.

  
  


She tilted her head to the side, the same way Eloise had in my cafe date dream. That’s right, she wasn’t Lydia at all, but perhaps she was something else entirely.

  
  


I closed my eyes, panicking a little. I simply kept them shut as I gathered myself. This was *my* dream, my creation. I was in control here, so how could it possibly turn into a nightmare? I willed her to be gone, for someone nice to be with me instead, but when I opened my eyes again, she was still there.

  
  


I snapped my eyes back shut instantly, so only an imprint of her figure flashed behind my eyelids. For a single frame, I’d seen a ghastly grin below wide, black eyes, one that stretched from ear to ear and arced unnaturally low.

  
  


*No*, I told myself. I wouldn’t subject myself to this while fully lucid. It wasn’t fair of my own brain to do this to me, knowing I was aware of myself. So I squeezed, scrunched my face up and shook my head, over and over and over.

  
  


And when I awoke I was in my bed. This was my method. When I’d realised I was dreaming within a nightmare before, this was my way of waking myself up, but I’d never had a dream become something terrifying while I was aware of it like that.

  
  


Climbing out of bed in the pitch black, I padded across to the curtains and opened them to try and figure out the time, where I was greeted by the blinding street lights and black sky. I looked down at the fabric of the curtain in my hand. I couldn’t really feel it and I wasn’t sure why I would look outside to check the time instead of just checking my phone. I hadn’t had to dodge the tangle of wires that usually blocked my side of the bed, either.

  
  


One, two, three, four, five, six, seven… Of course. I was still asleep. I smiled, glad I hadn’t lost my chance to have a nice dream and gazed down the street. It was unnaturally foggy outside and I didn’t like that, but it didn’t seem to change when I tried to make it sunny.

  
  


When I took in the stretching emptiness of the street, a face with a chilling smile flashed into my memory and I stiffly turned to look at my bedroom door. It was cloaked in darkness, so much that I could barely make out the frame of it. That familiar horror set into my core, paralysing me to the spot. I didn’t want to look at the door. Was it open? I wanted nothing more than to turn away from it, but something within me screamed warnings to not look out the window, either.

  
  


That same fear, the one I’d felt when I looked at Lydia-- at the *thing*\-- had me holding my breath. I closed my eyes, the only thing I could do to escape. It was here. I felt its presence. I knew my own brain well enough that I could feel when something was amiss; it was what had allowed me to begin lucid dreaming in the first place, after all.

  
  


With my sight taken away, I could only wait in silence for something to make a sound or touch me. I tensed, anticipating something brushing against me. I expected it so fiercely that I was beginning to force it.

  
  


Yes, someone’s here. Someone’s holding my hand, I was telling myself.

  
  


“Miles?” I said, quietly. “That’s you, isn’t it?”

  
  


Miles’ hand squeezed mine in response and I opened my eyes. I was still in the dark room, but now he was here with me. He was wearing the cap he often wore, back when we first got together, and he was smiling down at me.

  
  


“What is it?” He asked, rubbing his thumb soothingly over the back of my hand.

  
  


“Nothing, I just—” I stammered. “I thought something was here. Something horrible.”

  
  


He shrugged. “Just me.” He said, leaning down to kiss my forehead.

  
  


This time, he didn’t feel like some celebrity that I dreamed up or some other perfect version of Miles that he would be playing. It really felt like him and as though he knew exactly what was going on in my head.

  
  


I pulled him towards me and breathed in his chalky violet smell, as comforting and fresh as ever. “I miss you.” I said.

  
  


He stroked my hair and sighed. “I miss you, too,” He breathed onto the top of my head. “Where have you been, chick?”

  
  


Something was ringing in the distance, irritating me.

  
  


“Right here.” I said. “I’ll always be right here, waiting for you.”

  
  


When I looked up, he wasn’t wearing his hat anymore. His hair was wet. “Aren’t you going to answer that?” He said.

  
  


I gave him a puzzled look and listened out for the phone, afraid of who it could be. Ah, the ringing. It was my morning alarm. I was relieved it wasn’t that dreaded phone call again, but my morning alarm wasn’t what I wanted to hear, either.

  
  


“I love you.” I said, and I kissed him softly.

  
  


I’d never been so furious at my alarm as I was that morning, turning it off and shutting my eyes immediately to try and will Miles back to me. But a demented smile was all I could see, forcing me to let go and allow myself to wake up.

  
When I got out of bed, the first thing I did was count my fingers. Ten, as there should be. Although in that dream I'd wanted nothing more than to be out of it, being in reality meant I could no longer have Miles and the weight of that had my eyes watery as I made my coffee and I got ready for work.



It was on the drive to work that my phone really did ring. I knew better than to answer an unknown number, so I let it ring. My choice was further justified when the number tried me three more times.



I had ten fingers when Eloise said good morning to me and ten fingers when I stopped for lunch.



“What’s on your mind today?” She asked me, sidling up beside me.



I analysed her face for a second, looking for anything to cross-examine when I encountered her at night. “Nothing, really.” I said. “I just haven’t been sleeping well.”



“I thought so.” Eloise said, humming thoughtfully. “You look exhausted.”



“Thanks.” I muttered, with a half-hearted laugh.



“Seriously, though,” she reiterated. “Have some caffeine, or something. I’m not saying this to be mean, but I’ve been cleaning up after you all morning.”



I shot her a look of bewilderment. I had no recollection of being such a mess behind the counter all morning. I had the urge to double check I really was awake.



“Oh, I’m sorry.” I said. “I didn’t even realise.”



“That’s okay, I’m sorry to criticise you, it’s just that,” Eloise paused to check no one would overhear her. “Mallory’s been watching you.”



With an exaggerated roll of my eyes, I started picking at my nails. “I’m sure she has.” I grumbled. “She’s been looking for an excuse to fire me.”



“Don’t be silly!” Eloise exclaimed, giving me a light tap in the arm. “You know she can’t fire you, anyway, you’re invincible here. She might just have a chat with you if you get another order wrong.”



I held up a hand. “Woah-woah-woah,” I said. “What do you mean ‘invincible’?”



Eloise leaned back from me, her shoulders dropping. She opened her mouth and faltered. I began to piece together that she’d said something precarious before she even elaborated. “I just mean, with everything.” She said, quietly. “She wouldn’t do that to you.”



Mallory, my mother’s childhood friend, was talking enthusiastically to a customer on the other side of the cafe, unaware of her coworkers’ discussion of her. I knew she had given me this job to help me out, but I didn’t realise I was such a hinder to her business and that I’d left her trapped here with me. I’d already cost her customers by showing my face here, now I was making a mess of the job, too?



Eloise had left me to my thoughts at some point, catching onto the fact that she’d almost broached something dangerous. She busied herself with polishing and wrapping cutlery, as though that was an urgent task calling her attention.



When I left work, I snuck out to avoid a talk with Mallory. I hoped she didn’t figure out that I could hear her calling out to me as I walked out with my headphones on. I couldn’t avoid her stern lecture forever, but at least for today.



I knocked out by midnight, but nothing I dreamt about that following night stuck in my memory long enough to be of note. I only know that I woke up feeling even more tired than ever, afraid and paranoid that something had smiled at me again that night.



For a month or so, I was unable to keep up with the films my brain showed me. I’d simply be an audience member to the display my subconscious was able to come up with. If I ever managed to get ahold of myself, to realise I was dreaming, the cycle would begin.



The ‘cycle’, as I referred to it, was this torturous phenomenon in which my dreams and my reality began to blur together.



One of the most notable occurrences of the cycle was after a particularly troubling nightmare. I was with Miles, this time of my brain’s own doing and not my lucid actions. We were on a boat together, the pair of us soaking wet after swimming in our clothes. We were laughing away, enjoying each other’s company and the view of the sun dipping into the sea, when he started shivering.



Unaware that I was asleep, I began to swarm around him, wrapping him in my jacket and rubbing his arms to try and warm him up. He shut his eyes and seemed to go a little limp, slumped over in the boat, but his teeth continued to chatter.



“Miles?” I shook him, but he gave no response.



I couldn’t begin to explain why, but in my dream state, I figured he was past the point of no return. He was too cold to ever recover. His lips were blue, his lashes seemed to be glued shut with ice, his cheeks were gaunt and his clothes hung off him like a scarecrow.



Overheard, a gull began to dive at him, like he was a floating carcass, ripe for the picking. Although I did my best to swat it away, it wouldn’t relent, even trying to take some chunks out of me. Infuriated, I decided to solve the problem, gently pushing Miles backwards. He slid off the boat like a rag, as though his clothes were empty, teeth still chattering as he was submerged.



When I started crying, the gull landed on the boat, where Miles had been sitting previously. It started cawing at me with a disgusting scream, so I started swinging the oar of the boat at it. It dodged me again and again, deafening me with its wounded yowling.



At last, I managed to hit it, sending it with a splatter to the bottom of the boat. There it lay in pieces, black eyes flickering around and beak quivering as it let out little bird-like chortles.



Its eyes made me sick with terror. It was like there was something else in there, some parasite living alongside the bird that had now taken over its autonomy.



That all-too-familiar fear of something else being present turned me lucid. I was asleep and I hadn’t pushed Miles. This was just a nightmare. The bird got louder and louder with its pained screeches. Whatever it was, I stamped it out with an unbridled rage and awoke with a gasp that hurt my chest.



I was drenched in sweat, so much so that I considered the possibility that I’d pissed myself. The discomfort grew and my chest kept hurting as I lay in bed, surrounded by the dark, so I tried to roll over in bed. But when I turned over, I stopped dead.



There, in the dark, was a girl. She mirrored my position exactly, one hand under her head and the other under her chin, but she had large, black eyes and a tiny mouth and nose, like her head wasn’t fully developed.



Gradually, she began to open her mouth, where a black void laid within. It opened wider, beginning to distort her eyes, and my heart pounded so loud I was sure I couldn’t possibly be asleep.



Unable to move, I did the only thing I could think to do and shut my eyes, squeezing tight. I held strong for ten seconds and when I let go and looked, she was still there. So I tried again. I knew this would work, it always did, so I just kept squeezing. Checking, then squeezing.



After my fourth attempt, I opened my eyes to a bright room. With an uncontrolled sob, I snagged my phone from where it was plugged on the floor and checked the time. It was 08:43AM, meaning I was going to be late to work.



I ran to work, sweating and trying to tie my hair up, but when I arrived, there was only Eloise and Mallory in the cafe, sitting around a table. There was a third seat for me, so I had a feeling I was in some deep shit.



When I sat down, they were mid conversation. Mallory spared me a quick glance and then let out a groan, motioning her hand at me. “You see what I mean?” She said, pinching the bridge of her nose.



Eloise shook her head, disapprovingly. “I know, I’ve been telling her.” She said.



I looked between them, confused, before I realised I was sat there in my pyjamas, no shoes on and likely yesterday’s mascara smeared across my face.



“Please, just give me another shot.” I begged Mallory. “I can be a valuable employee to you, I swear! You can fire me if I’m useless, okay? You don’t need to keep me here just because you feel bad, but let me prove myself, please.”



“Did you run here?” Was all Mallory said.



“Yes, I—” I stammered, wiping sweat from my forehead with shame. But then I stopped.



The cafe was thirteen miles from my house and I had run here. No way in hell could I have done that. I checked my phone. 08:43AM. I counted my fingers.



When I woke up, the little girl was there again, so I forced myself awake. 08:43AM.



I wouldn’t do it again, I wouldn’t rush to work. This was a dream, after all. I sat up in bed and looked around. Nothing felt off. Ten fingers, but I wouldn’t believe it.



I wrapped my arms around myself and listened to the silence in my apartment. Any minute now, my brain would summon something. I waited, but nothing came.



It was only when I stopped waiting that there was a noise in the other room and the fear hit me. I had been trying to summon something, but nothing would come, so whatever was here now was no creation of mine.



“Wake up, please.” I said, out loud. “Wake up. Wake up.”



The noise in the other room had initially been a single tap, but it escalated into a scratching that seemed to scurry across the floor, towards my bedroom door.



I shut my eyes. “Miles?” I called out.



When I called out to him, the instance that followed was the first time I ever heard the thing speak to me.



The sound was gravelly and echoed in my head like it was speaking right into my ear. There were layers of higher, whistling octaves and deep, bass tones reciting the words: “He’s gone.”



Some weeks after this particular cycle, I decided it was time to call him. He hadn’t heard from me in over a year, but I’d reached my wits’ end. I’d spent my waking hours meditating, writing and medicating, but I knew there would be no end to my nightmares if I didn’t get some closure.



I listened to it ring with shaky hands. I had no idea how he would react, but I only prayed it wasn’t anger. I was the one who left him, so what right did I have to seek closure?



“Hello?” Came his voice, his soothing, safe voice, from the other end.



“Miles, hey.” I said, my voice wobbling in response. “I’m so sorry to bother you. I know it’s been a long time and I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but there’s something I really want to talk to you about.”



I stumbled over my words as I spoke, unsure of what to even say now that I had the chance to say it.



The line went silent for a little while. “Is everything alright?” He finally said.



My vision blurred with tears at the goodness of his heart to even ask. “Well, yes, sort of,” I stammered. “I just really need to speak to you. In person.”



He went quiet again. Just as I began to get antsy, he replied. “Okay.” He said. “Do you want me to come over?”



“Yes, please. Thank you,” I was practically wailing. “Thank you, thank you.”



“Don’t thank me.” He said, sharply. “I’ll listen to what you have to say, but this won’t happen again.”



I started nodding frantically, as if he could see me. “That’s fine, that’s fine.”



“Don’t expect anything, Drea.” He said. “You left me, remember?”



“No, I know—” I began, but the phone started beeping in my ear. I pulled it away to see that there was someone else calling me. “Hang on.”



I picked up and readied myself to start yelling at the unknown number to leave me alone, to go to hell, whatever curses and insults I could come up with, but I stopped short.



“Andrea?” It was Miles’ mother. I’d recognise that voice anywhere, after all the hours I’d listened to it scream at me.



“Hello?” I whispered.



I got up from my bed and looked out the window, as though expecting Miles to show up already and save me from whatever his mother was about to tell me.



“Have you heard from Miles?” She asked.



“Yes?” I mumbled. “I just spoke to him.”



“Was he driving to you?”



I swallowed, dryly, shielding my eyes with my hand. I couldn’t answer her. I stared into the palm of my hand.



“Andrea, answer me.” She began, her voice getting louder. “Did you tell him to drive to your house?”



“So what if I did?”



“He’s been killed, Andrea! My son is lying on a slate, freezing cold and full of water because you insisted on him coming to see you in these weather conditions! He drowned, slowly, painfully, because of you!”



I hung up the phone. Eight fingers on my hand.



Miles was fine, I told myself. This isn’t real. Nothing that feels this bad is ever real.



When I woke up from that one I was in a hospital bed, one hand held by my mother and the other by Miles. I broke my hand free of his and counted. No good.



I squeezed my eyes shut. Again. And again.



“Wake me up.” I whispered, staring at the white ceiling.



Miles took my hand again. “Why?” He asked. His hand was freezing cold.



His eyes looked darker than they usually were and I had to close my eyes and look away from him. I trusted him, up here in my head, more than anything. No matter how many times I stabbed him, pushed him, strangled him, he’d never be the one to hurt me. So what had changed now? Why now had the parasite begun to change the way he looked at me?



The next time I looked at him, water seemed to be streaming from his mouth. He started coughing.



“I’m sorry.” I breathed out. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”



He tried to speak to me, but no sound would come out aside from choked gargling. His eyes were bloodshot, neck veins bulging.



I continued, desperately. “I never would’ve left you there if I’d known there was a chance.” I cried out. “Please, believe me! I didn’t want you to die!”



“He can’t hear you, sweetheart.” My mother said, softly, from beside me.

  
Black hair fell to the floor from Miles' head in a clump as he convulsed, blood dripping from his nose that had become disfigured by his own nails clawing at his neck and face.



“He has to!” I exclaimed, thrashing free of her grip. “It’s not too late! Miles, I wish every day it had been me left behind in that car.”



There were many times that I poured my heart out to him, that I was sorry, that I wanted to die in his place, but he never seemed to get the chance to hear me.



At 08:43AM, after a long night of keeping awake, dosed up on caffeine and cocaine, I got in my car and drove. Every now and then, I’d catch glimpses of him in my mirrors. I’d remember the times we laughed, the times we sang at the top of our lungs, each one reflected back at me. I remembered the last time, our big fight. He’d been yelling, he’d knocked my coffee out of my hands, splashing it across my lap and across the seat. I’d screamed back at him.



Glazed over with rage and masked by the dark, he’d missed the car coming around the bend on the narrow road. I was angry when I grabbed that wheel, I remember that very well.



I pulled up at the bend and stared down the ditch over the dashboard. In that moment, in the few minutes that I questioned myself, my phone rang. I never picked up these anonymous calls, knew it would only be someone trying to hurt me, but for some reason, in my current state of mind, I answered.

  
I didn't even get a chance to speak before the voice on the other end said the word I'd grown used to hearing.



""Murderer.""



When I put my foot down and aimed for the lake, I only hoped I wouldn’t dream when I was dead.



The drive down to the lake was longer than I remember the fall being, the car banging over every rock as the ground fell away. One rock in particular jostled me so hard that I lunged forward and hit my head on the wheel. Something crawled down my forehead, so fast that it wasn't long before it reached my eyes and I saw blood.



By the time I hit the water, I’d almost changed my mind, but the cold rushing in sobered me up and set me in my decision.



Just as I’d dreamed it, I unfastened my seatbelt and crawled over to the passenger seat, exactly where I’d been that night, where I’d turned to see him bleeding out and completely motionless.

  
Alive.



It was when the cold water rose to my neck that I looked in the rear view mirror and saw it. The thing that my brain hadn’t invited in was watching me sink with its black eyes. But I didn't have the strength to even be afraid of it anymore.



Water filled my lungs and rattled me from the inside out. The pain was welcome, every nerve in my body reacting like electricity, but my physical reaction was to start madly clawing at the window, at the door, at myself, at anything.



In the flurry of bubbles and the sound of my own muffled voice screaming, I saw in my bleary line of sight the number of fingers on my hand.

From the desk of Dr. Richard Cephalo.

I could see why Sam had described it as a warehouse. From a distance, that's exactly what it looked like. It was a large, concrete building that bore the unmistakable brutalist architecture that almost all commercial property had in the area. It was only when I drove up to the chain-linked fence surrounding the area that I could see the sign over the entrance that read “Wellwood Sanitarium.”

On the list of things that I would not want to be doing at half past four in the morning, exploring an abandoned mental asylum in an attempt to discover the dumping grounds of a murderer was at the very top of it. If I hadn't been picturing the faces of Erica and my wife, I would have gotten back into my car and drove away, but desperation compelled me where courage failed.

I thought about calling the police for the hundreth time since I saw the location on Google, but once again thought about how useless they've been for the past year. I imagined them driving by the building, looking once at it, and then driving on. I wondered what I could tell them that would actually get them to go into the building. The more I thought about what I would tell them, the less sane it all sounded to me.

“Yes, I heard from some crazy homeless people that a guy called the Doctor is taking people off the street and doing... something to them. I was then assured by a lady high on black tar heroin that this place was somehow connected. Could you please waste your time and resources to enter this building and check it out?”

If I could bring them some kind of evidence, maybe then they'd actually open an investigation that wasn't just for the sake appearances. I was hoping to provide them a body since I still wasn't allowing myself the luxury of hoping they were alive.

As I hopped over the fence and started making my way to the entrance of the building, I once again reminded myself that this was to get justice for my wife, for Erica, for the others. I wasn't going to let myself entertain delusions of a rescue mission. It would be too painful when I found their rotting bodies. If I found them.

The doors of the building had been boarded up at one point, but I could see that one of the boards had been pried off of the structure and a window smashed in. The thought of the police entered my mind for the hundred and first time. I finally decided I would compromise with myself and pulled out my cell phone. I punched in nine, one, one and didn't call. I'd keep it ready to call out at a moment's notice though.

I stepped through the makeshift hole into the building, hearing the crunch of broken glass under my feet like some kind of industrial facsimile of snow, the sound echoing around the darkened corridors and making my heart race. The first strange thing I noticed was the lack of graffiti. In a city where even the inhabited structures would be marked with street art, this building had none of it. I thought back to how Sam, the homeless man from earlier in the night, had said no one goes in here, and felt sick to my stomach.

I turned on the flashlight on my phone, casting the glare up and down the hallways as I walked. Near the entrance, there was a glass case with a series of photos in it. They seemed to be different medical personnel that had worked in the hospital, names and titles printed beneath each image. I spared it a glance and continued on, not exactly sure what I was looking for.

After a few minutes, I came to a stairwell, leading both up and down. I ended up deciding I'd check upstairs first, climbing each step carefully and trying my hardest to listen to the stillness over the thumping of my heart in my ears.

When I graced the top of the stairs, I thought I was on the set of a horror movie. It was a grid like series of hallways lined with doors that were so close together, there was no doubt that they were cells. I glanced through the little glass window of one door and saw they were padded rooms. I couldn't help but think of being stuck in one of these cells, thrashing away with no one to listen to my panicked screams. I pushed the thought out of my mind and continued on, finding nothing but more of the same. I knew at this point I was putting off what I dreaded the most: going downstairs to the basement area.

I retraced my steps back to the stairwell and began making my way downwards. Each descending step I took were like the days ticking down to Armageddon, the end of days waiting in the looming darkness of the underground. When I reached the end, I saw two doors propped open and felt my heart jump into my throat. Someone had kept these doors open for a reason, and it was the first evidence of humanity I've found in this place. At least, I hoped it was humanity, feeling that it could just as well of been a demonic presence that seen fit to fix these heavy wooden doors open.

I passed the threshold and the baleful light of my phone struggled to illuminate the wide space I was in. The floor was dirty, covered in so much dust that it was almost like walking on dirt. I figured if I was going to find a body, it would surely be in here. Before I could venture too deep into this realm of nightmares, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. I turned off the light on my phone, crouching behind a gurney I was near. I could see a beam come from the stairs, looking like a searchlight hovering back and forth in the basement. It revealed more of the room to me, and I could see that it was full of discarded wheelchairs, crash carts and other derelict medical equipment.

I was certain I was about to be killed. I held my breath as I watched a silhouette wielding the light began walking up and down the breadth of the place. My eyes began to play tricks on me in high contrast of light and darkness, and I could of sworn I saw figures moving just outside the light and huddling in the corners of the room. The imposing figure with the flashlight suddenly spoke.

“You can't be down here, come on! It isn't safe and you're trespassing!”

As he stepped forward in front of me, I could make out the uniform of a security guard in the gloom. My heart began to settle down, just as my hiding space was illuminated and I stood up and raised up my hands to show I was no danger.

“Sorry, I'll leave right away, sir,” I heard my panicked voice say, echoing off of the walls and sounding much too loud in this empty place.

“Buddy, why would you want to be down here anyways? Come on back upstairs, I'll walk you to the door.”

Now that I could see the security guard a little better, I could see he was a middle aged man with salt and pepper hair, and a mustache sprouting from beneath a long nose. I almost chuckled, thinking he looked like a cartoonist's rendition of a security guard.

“Sorry, I was looking around here because I thought it looked cool,” was only excuse I could come up with, and it sounded stupid as hell to my own ears. However, the security guard seemed to agree.

“Hey, you don't 'have to tell me. There's just something about abandoned places that draw people into it. Still, I can't have the property owners being liable for someone falling through a dilapidated floor and breaking their neck.”

“No, I get it. I'm sorry, I didn't think about it.”

“My name is Stanley, by the way,” the guard said reaching out to shake my hand, which I took and replied by introducing myself as well.

“I'm Robert, good to meet you.”

“Well, Robert, let's grab a cup of coffee from my office real quick, and you can tell me what you were actually doing here.”

I immediately liked Stanley, and if there was anything going on in this creepy place, he would be an invaluable resource of information. He led me back towards the entrance, stopping just short of it and opening what I had taken for a maintenance closet. Inside, he flipped a switch and a light came on, illuminating a desk, a few chairs and a coffee maker that sat in the corner. He sat down his flashlight and began pouring grounds into the coffee maker followed by water from a gallon jug he kept under the desk.

“So why in the world would you come to an abandoned insane asylum at this time of night anyways?”

“Well, it's going to sound crazy...”

“Hey, you're in the right place for that,” Stanley said with a deep laugh.

“Maybe I am. My wife went missing a year ago and I heard this place could be connected to it.”

“That seems like a bit of stretch, Robert. Where did you get that idea?”

“From some homeless people, they had been convinced there was someone hurting people and that I'd find something here.”

“Sounds like an urban legend to me. Sorry to hear about your wife though, that's pretty rough. I lost my brother and sister a when I was a kid, so I know how something like that can hit you.”

“I'm sorry to hear that, what happened?”

Stanley sat a coffee cup in front of me and I took a long sip as he sat down across the desk from me and leaned back with a heavy sigh.

“It was a long time ago. I think I was ten years old. My little brother went missing and my older sister went out to find him. Never found out what had happened to them, just that they found their bodies out in a park a few weeks later. There's monsters out there, buddy. Monsters who don't think twice about killing women and children. I couldn't imagine what kind of sick thoughts run through their mind.”

“I know what you mean. I see a lot of that kind of stuff in my business.”

“Oh, what do you do Robert?”

“I'm a psychologist. Usually, my job is just talking and listening to people to get them to think through what's bothering them, but I also volunteer at prisons, and there's some real horror shows out there. Still, it's not the ones behind bars that scare me...”

“It's the ones who aren't,” he finished for me.

“Yea... Knowing they exist is scary. Like a sheep seeing the wolves that circle them.”

“Like the guy the homeless people told you about?”

“Yea, they call him the Doctor. They even have a creepy rhyme about him.”

“Sounds like a hell of a ghost story if I ever heard one,” he said with another small laugh.

“Yea, they say he targets red headed young boys and blonde haired women.”

“You know, my little brother had red hair and my sister was a blonde... maybe that's why I do it?”

“Do what?” I asked, suddenly confused and feeling all the warmth being sucked out of the room as a shiver ran down my spine.

“Oh, you know, Robert. Fix people. I don't like the Doctor name though. Doctors diagnose you. Now surgeons, they're the ones who work on you. They're the ones that do the fixing.”

I felt sick and tried to stand up, but my legs crumpled and I fell down against the floor, hard. The coffee cup I had been drinking from fell and crashed to the floor in front of me, my mind catching up to what had just happened.

“Don't fight it, Robert. It's okay, It's just a little something to keep you from moving too much,” he said with another short laugh, sounding genuinely comforting despite the sinister implications he was speaking of.

“It's true what I said earlier, Robert. I couldn't imagine what those sick fucks who kill women and children think about. I've never killed anyone. No, I don't hurt people, I fix them. And I'm going to fix you too, Robert.”

He stood up and reached under his desk, coming up with a black leather bag, like the ones old Doctors would carry when they made house calls. I fought to push myself upright, but my muscles weren't cooperating.

“It's a shame about Sam. He was just here, by the way. I was just prepping him for surgery when I heard you stumbling around in here. Now, you're gonna have to wait your turn but it shouldn't take long,” he said, digging around in the bag and coming up with a a bottle and a rag.

“Families get torn apart, Robert. They get torn apart by time, by tragedy, by monsters. I'm not tearing families apart, I'm putting one together. And you're gonna love being part of that family. Do you understand, Robert?”

I didn't like the way he kept saying my name, as if he was trying to get used to it, tasting it on his tongue and developing a pallet for it. He kept repeating it, each time making my stomach churn.

He started dousing the rag with the bottle, continuing to speak.

“I used to work here back in the day, Robert. I was an orderly. I was the one that would come in and subdue patients that got out of hand. They called it 'booty juice,' that shit we'd stick them with. We'd shoot them up through the ass, which is where it got its nickname. They'd go limp and calm down immediately, until it wore off and they freaked out again. You see, psychologists like yourself are going about it all wrong. The problem is in the brain, not the mouth and ears, Robert.”

He bent down with the rag, close enough that I could smell his cologne. Roses, lemons and cloves. He had a comforting smile, and I almost felt myself relaxing as he placed a hand on my shoulder. Almost.

“Don't do this, Stanley. Please don't do this...” I pleaded as my lips became harder and harder to maneuver against the effects of whatever he had slipped me. While I talked, I managed to dig one of my hands into my pocket, trying to get to my phone.

“Don't worry, Robert. I know you're scared, but like I said, I don't hurt people. I fix them.”

The rag was shoved over my mouth and nose. I held my breath and kept concentrating on my phone that gave a little buzz as the fingerprint reader acknowledged me and it opened. I pressed what I hoped was the call out button and then could fight it no longer. I inhaled and my vision began to darken at the corners.

“Go to sleep, Robert. Sleep and dream of your wife. Dream of freedom. Dream of your new family.”

My vision flickered, threatening to dissolve as my lungs demanded that I breath in. I could feel Stanley's large hand forcing the rag against my face. I also heard the faint sound of a busy tone, realizing I must of punched in some extra numbers by mistake when I went to call out. The police weren't coming.

Suddenly, the door was thrown open and I saw Sam rush into view. He was wearing a hospital gown and had blood streaming down his wrists. He barreled into Stanley, punching and kicking wildly. I began crawling out of the door, hearing a commotion of meaty thuds behind me, but not bothering to look back to see who was winning. I scrambled out into the hallway, my legs and arms barely working. I heard a mighty crash and splintering wood and silently prayed Sam was winning his fight.

My prayers went unanswered as Stanley grabbed me from behind and forced the rag back over my face. As my vision begin to vanish entirely, I could see a faint silvery glow coming from the entrance of the building. The morning sun was just outside my reach. I almost made it.

Then, darkness.

When I woke up, I was strapped to a gurney. I was back in the basement and I could see a bright light shining from the center of the room. There was another figure on a gurney there, and as the face turned towards me, I could see it was Sam.

“Sorry, mister,” he whispered.

Stanley walked in front of him, severing my view of his face. He was wearing a surgeon's gown and had the doctor bag in his left hand. He sat it down on a surgical cart next to him and begin to rummage around inside it while humming.

I saw something move in the shadows and slowly became aware of people lining the darkness. They barely moved at all, but I could see them there.

“Now, Sam, you have a very important decision to make. I need you to choose. Will it be the eye or the nose?”

I tried to wrap my head around what Stanley was doing, but all I could see was his back.

“I choose for you to go fuck yourself,” came Sam's calm voice.

I wasn't nearly as brave, so I started struggling against the binds that were securing me, my heart thumping hard as one of the figures in the dark started making its way towards me.

“Sam... it's time to choose. Will it be your nose or your eye?”

The figure closed in on me and I almost screamed. It was Becca. It was my wife.

“Okay, Sam, eye it is. Don't worry, it sounds worse than it is,” came Stanley's voice across the room.

Becca looked like some sort of ghost, he hair knotted and tangled, covered in grease. She had a vacant look in her eyes. I had been prepared for a dead body, I had been prepared for bones, but I hadn't been prepared for this. She said nothing as she began to undo my straps.

I could hear Sam screaming. I've never heard a human scream like that, high pitched and full of agony. I could hear a pinging sound, metal on metal. The first strap was pulled free and Becca stared at me with unseeing eyes, a little drool pooling at the corner of her mouth. I pulled the other strap free as quietly as I could and began working on my feet.

Sam's scream had changed. As the pinging sound continued, he began to sound more like a wounded animal than a person. It was becoming less a scream and more of a loud groaning sound.

Ping. Ping. Ping.

I freed my legs and quietly crept over the side of my gurney, feeling all my fear turn into white hot hatred. Stanley had told me that he couldn't fathom what went through the minds of those who killed people, but in that moment, I understood perfectly.

I silently walked over to Stanley who was too intent on his “surgery” to notice me. Sam had gone completely quiet now, the sound of his moans drowned out by the ringing of the hammer on the metal pin that was shoved into the side of his eye.

The doctor bag was on the cart just behind him, and I reached in, retrieving the rag and bottle from before. I tried not to even breath as I worked, dousing the rag in chloroform.

“See, Sam, nothing to be scared of. You're all better now,” I heard Stanley saying. He started to turn to the gurney I had woken up on.

“Alright Robert, it's your-” he stopped seeing me standing just behind him.

I screamed out, all my fear evolving into a rage I hadn't felt before and pressed the rag over his face while punching him repeatedly in the ear. He stumbled backwards, knocking over the gurney with Sam on it and giving out a muffled cry as I kept the rag against his face.

“Go to sleep, Stan! Just go to sleep and have nightmares of the hell I'm about to send you to!” I heard myself screaming in fury.

Stanley was a big man, but I had caught him off guard. My rage and adrenaline lent me strength I hadn't known I possessed as I battered him. His struggles became weaker and weaker.

When he stopped moving, I looked over at Sam. A trickle of blood was coming from his eye where Stanley had shoved the needle during his lobotomy. I felt tears welling up in my eyes, but they weren't tears of sadness. They were tears of anger.

When Stanley finally awoke, he was strapped to the same gurney that he had put Sam on earlier. He struggled against the straps and looked up at me.

“Don't kill me, Robert! I helped them! I fixed them!”

I didn't respond, I was too angry to. Instead, I grabbed a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the doctor bag and began dousing Stanley's struggling form with it.

“Robert, I helped them! I helped them!”

I pulled out my cigarettes, the same pack I had earlier that day when I gave one of the cigarettes to the crazy old lady outside the bar. I lit one and took a deep drag off it.

“You know, my wife wanted me to quit smoking. I always told her I would, but never got around to it. Especially after she went missing,” I whispered, glancing at my wife sitting in the corner among the other dozen or so victims crowding the edges of the basement. I could see her face catch the light very slightly, looking completely vacant, though I thought I saw the corners of her mouth turn up very slightly as I spoke.

“Robert, let me go. I'll turn myself in. You can call the cops. Just don't do this,” said Stanley quietly, though I wasn't listening. I was too busy staring at the face of the woman I loved. The woman he had kidnapped, lobotomized and held for a year.

“I think your little brother ran away from you because he hated you,” I said absentmindedly.

Stanley stopped thrashing and went still, his mouth opening and closing as he tried to form words.

“You know, I kept wondering how come I didn't call the police when I came here. I kept telling myself it was because I was worried about them not doing their jobs, just dismissing my call or something, but that wasn't it. I didn't call them because you'd end up in prison. I've seen what it's like for the people there, and believe it or not, they all acclimate to it.”

I resumed pouring the rubbing alcohol over Stanley's bound form, emptying the bottle and pulling out my lighter.

“I don't know if you'll acclimate to fire or not. Maybe you'll get used to it after a while, when you're burning in hell.”

“Robert, don't. Don't!”

I sparked the lighter and stood back, the fire spreading quickly as it ate the fumes from the alcohol. Stanley screamed as it consumed him, but I wasn't looking. I had seen all I had come to see.

There's forgotten places in the world, places where predators discard the bones of their prey. They leave them to rot into dust like offerings to the world so that their crimes would be forgotten. That was Stanley now, the notorious Doctor of Dallas. He was a burning sacrament to those he had “fixed.”

I led his victims outside to the early morning sun and called the authorities. I didn't tell them that I had lit Stanley on fire and they never found a body, so I guess I'm not going to go to prison for murder.

I didn't see Erica reunite with her mother, though I can imagine how hard that must have been for Mrs. Watkins. I hear that Sam is making a recovery at a long term facility in Houston. He's able to speak, at least. He's getting better every day.

As for Becca, I've been looking after her. She's home now, and the photos of her that used to look at me so accusingly have softened. She's getting better, though I know she'll never be the same. It's been a couple months and she's starting to talk now and again. It's small phrases, usually one word, though she said she loved me last night and I've never felt such hope in all my life.

I thought I'd put all of this behind me and keep living my life one day at a time. Yet, every time I go to the store, I find myself looking at the wall of missing people, and last week noticed something familiar. Blonde women and red headed children have started going missing again. Stanley's body was never recovered, so he could still be out there, “fixing” people with his obscene style of medicine. It keeps me up at night, but having Becca home is enough for me.

I mostly managed to move on, though I had a disturbing experience when I went down to the homeless encampment in Arlington. I was bringing them clothes, blankets and food since I found a new appreciation for the horrors they face. I saw the crazy cart lady again, and I gave her a whole carton of cigarettes for being the catalyst that led to me finding my wife again. I offered to get her more help, but she told me she prefers to live among her people.

I didn't push the issue, instead I just started walking back to my car where Becca waited in the passenger seat and smiled blissfully at nothing. As I was getting into the car, I saw a young homeless woman sitting by herself on the edge of the encampment, her sing song voice carrying to my ears...

He makes you sleepy with his doctor rag

He thumps away with his doctor hammer

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I’ve seen the same GI dr multiple times, and I have gotten both a colonoscopy and endoscopy within the last year. Colonoscopy showed internal hemmroids due to chronic constipation, and the endoscopy found that I had more bile reflux with only some acid reflux. I’ve been eating a bland diet, cut out coffee completely, and have been taking omeprazole and sucralfate. My acid reflux has definitely gotten a lot better but it’s still very much there. I mostly feel it in my throat and esophagus with some stomach pains and nausea. I have a lot of health anxiety and anxiety in general, and I’m very concerned that I have stomach cancer even though my endoscopy in July showed nothing. I had a biopsy done as well to get tested for cancer and h pylori and there was nothing. I’m extremely worried and just want this to stop. Any tips?

(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump imposed tariffs and sanctions on Colombia hours after its leftist president refused to allow two military planes carrying deported migrants to land, punishing a US ally for stepping even partially out of line with his immigration goals.

In a social media post Sunday, Trump said he ordered an emergency 25% tariff on all Colombian goods coming into the US, which will be raised to 50% in a week. Oil, gold, coffee and flowers top the list of exports, according to Colombia’s tax authorities.  
  
Trump’s action upended decades of warm relations between the two countries and may be devastating to the Andean nation’s fragile economy. Relations between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro had been widely expected to be strained, though the deterioration was swifter and more damaging than almost anyone anticipated.

“Petro’s denial of these flights has jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States,” Trump said in his post. 

Petro responded less than three hours after Trump’s post that he had ordered retaliatory tariffs of 25% on US imports. The Colombian government will help with the process of replacing more expensive US imports with domestic production, he said in a post on X, without elaborating.

Trump’s reaction shows how he sees tariffs as an economic weapon to be deployed against governments that may challenge his geopolitical goals. It sends a powerful message to the world, that not even old political allies are safe if they do not cooperate with him.

The actions were taken in response to two flights carrying a total of 160 people, part of a group of 350 Colombians scheduled for deportation, a person familiar with the situation said.

Petro initially welcomed the flights but changed his mind when it became clear the US was sending the migrants on military planes. Mexico canceled a flight of deportees before it took off, saying in advance that it would not allow a military plane to land, the person said. 

Latin American officials, including Petro, have also said they were dismayed by the migrants arriving in leg shackles and handcuffs. The US and El Salvador are working on an asylum agreement that would allow US officials to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to the Central American nation.

In a statement on Sunday, Colombia said it would offer the presidential plane to ferry migrants back. And Petro’s recently appointed Foreign Affairs Minister, Laura Sarabia, said that Colombia was open to talks with the US.

Colombian-US Trade

While most South American nations now do more business with China, the US remains Colombia’s top trading partner. 

Between January and November 2024, Colombian exports to the US reached $13 billion, a near 8% increase compared to the same period in 2023. Colombians in the US also generate strong cultural ties and remittance flows.

Colombia is the US’s fourth-biggest source of foreign oil, topping both Saudi Arabia and Brazil, according to the Energy Information Administration. The latest data showed Colombia shipping more than 215,000 barrels of crude daily to US ports.

About a third, or 29%, of Colombian exports go to the US.

Trump also called for a travel ban and immediate visa revocations on Colombian government officials “and all Allies and Supporters” as well as visa sanctions on party members, family members and supporters of Petro’s government. The US Embassy’s visa section will close on Monday, potentially canceling hundreds of appointments, the person familiar said.

Trump also said in his post that he would enhance customs inspections of all Colombian nationals and cargo on national security grounds. He added that under his executive authority, Treasury, banking and financial sanctions will be fully imposed. 

Trump delivered a fresh threat upon taking office to place tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on Feb. 1, which he said would balance trade deals and collect revenue to offset his domestic legislative proposals. While on the campaign trail, he considered creating a universal baseline tariff as a way to incentivize manufacturing and business in the United States.

Colombia has historically been one of Washington’s biggest allies in Latin America and a major recipient of US aid and military assistance. Yet as one of the region’s leading leftist leaders, Petro was already on the wrong side of Trump. Petro has courted China and slammed Israel over the death toll among Palestinians in its war with Hamas.

“Petro’s response to Trump was foolish and it was a fight he won’t win,” Sergio Guzmán, an analyst at Colombia Risk Analysis said. “Social media posts have consequences, and it will be a difficult moment for Colombia as it will have real repercussions on us.”

“It couldn’t come at a worst moment for the Colombian flower industry,” he said, given Valentine’s Day is approaching. 

The two countries’ ties were already at risk after last week, when guerrillas from the Marxist ELN group went door to door with death lists in a bid to seize total control of Catatumbo, a mountainous cocaine-producing region near the Venezuelan border.

As a result, Colombia could potentially face decertification as a partner in the war on drugs, putting it in the same rogue category as Nicolás Maduro’s Venezuela — even if the effect would be more reputational than financial.

The White House has said that it has arrested 538 illegal immigrants and had begun using military aircrafts to remove them within the administration’s first 100 hours.

I have an 8 year old who will be a rising 3rd grader when we relocate this summer. We're coming to the area to get a sense of different towns and I'd love help setting an itinerary. Ultimately, we want to choose a town where:

1.  We will have easy access to hiking/nature and be within 60 minutes of skiing.

2.  We will be no more than 35-40 minutes from downtown Portland.

3.  The school is friendly and has a reputation for engaged, happy teachers. We care less about test scores (we're moving from a great school with mediocre test scores)....but we want a nice, friendly vibe (to the extent you can figure out a school's atmosphere).

4.  We can afford about 1.1 mil for a house.  We're low key people and don't need a fancy house/neighborhood, so we may not spend our entire budget.  It's more important to us to live somewhere friendly and with access to nature.  We're moving from a city and are excited to have some green space!

Which towns would you explore?  Specifically, how would you arrange a day to get a sense of the various towns?  We're thinking Cumberland, Yarmouth and Brunswick all look good to the north, but I'm not sure how to get a sense of the different schools/vibes of these towns.

\- Apparently, having a protein shake after is good for growth and recovery, so I'll be drinking one after each workout. Should I drink one after cardio too?

however friday day 3 in a row of taking it i felt it within 35ish minutes and it made me feel like my head was floating got super anxious then it went away and i seemed ok,

if you do take daily do you just give up coffee any kind of caffeine and alcohol bevy’s 
and does it feel different each time you take it?

1iatf0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1iatf0x/restarting_keto_with_a_sugar_addiction/,Restarting keto with a “sugar addiction”,"Hello friends,

So I’m trying keto again after developing a chronic compulsion towards emotional/binge eating sugary foods. 

I have tried keto previously, but I did not approach it from a healthy standpoint and became incredibly afraid of food, which I believe is what contributed to my sugar addiction coming back with a vengeance. 

I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD, which also makes plenty of sense to me in regards to my issue with emotional eating and sugar addiction. 
Because of my compulsion towards stimulating myself with cheap sources of dopamine, I have decided to cut any and all negative sources of overstimulation entirely.

This ties into my second (committed) run with keto, but it’s honestly not the forefront of my motivation. I’m in a lot of mental and physical pain because of my cycle with compulsive eating (sugar) and restricting. And I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s a lifestyle change I need to make for the rest of my life if I want to be happy and functional, and it’s one I’m committing to in the long term.

Starting today, I’m adapting to a ketogenic, but higher protein-oriented diet to pair with muscle training later down the line; but right now I want to focus on adjusting to a clean cut, strictly ketogenic diet.
I decided to post here so that I can keep track of my progress and maybe seek help where it’s necessary. 

I also intend to pair this dietary change with plenty of walks and exercise.

I do have a few questions for anyone interested,

What is anyone’s go-to substitute for electrolytes without sugar, that is easy on a budget?

How does anyone manage living with people who keep buying trigger foods?

Are there any tips anyone has off the top of their head to manage fatigue during the first initial weeks that don’t include copious amounts of caffeine? (I have to exclude coffee, but will keep green tea)

How do you approach exercise when fatigued?
Is it difficult to build muscle while on keto in the long run?

Thank you ",12,1737933166.0,keto,22,0.81,False

1iatewr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1iatewr/how_i_got_my_mbb_offer/,How I got my MBB Offer,"Landing that MBB offer was nothing short of a wild roller coaster—absolutely not for the faint of heart. The moment we stepped onto campus, consulting recruiting was already in full swing. I was still figuring out where to get coffee in the student lounge when our Consulting Club kicked off their first intro session, and the on-campus employer events flooded our schedules almost immediately. Although I wasn’t entirely sure about the best strategy, I decided to go all in: I tried to attend every firm event and ended up scheduling close to thirty coffee chats for each MBB. It was exhausting, but it allowed me to figure out which people I really clicked with.

One lesson I learned the hard way: do NOT, for the love of all that is good, apply for a role in New York City unless you truly enjoy pain. I spread my applications across New York and Boston, went to exclusive partner chats and private events in New York—only to walk away empty-handed there. Meanwhile, Boston was a completely different story: everyone I met seemed not only brilliant but also incredibly friendly, and there wasn’t the same frenzy of people competing for a coveted spot. Moral of the story: if you can avoid the feeding frenzy of NYC, avoid it.

While juggling all these firm events and coffee chats, the Consulting Club organized weekly meetings that grouped us into case teams of about five students. Honestly, I didn’t get much out of my assigned group, but there were always people in our “freelance casing” Slack channel who were down to practice at the drop of a hat. If you’re prepping for interviews, don’t underestimate the importance of drilling your math skills—McKinsey’s calculations are notoriously more intense than BCG’s or Bain’s. I did about twenty practice cases, absorbed all the negative feedback, and put myself out there to connect with as many firm members as I could. It helped that a lot of people at each firm were genuinely willing to help me practice.

In the end, though, I realized the real test isn’t the case alone; it’s the fit. By the time you’ve put in enough practice, you’ll probably be capable of solving any case they throw at you. What truly matters is how well you connect with your interviewer. Be warm, be friendly, and show genuine curiosity about them and their work. If you’ve done your research, drop a casual reference to something that might excite them—it goes a long way in showing your personality and establishing rapport.

You should brace yourself for plenty of rejections, critiques, and tough feedback. That said, many consultants genuinely want to see you succeed if you’ve demonstrated dedication and a positive attitude. For those about to start the MBB recruiting journey—especially at Yale SOM—my best advice is to hit the ground running, build real relationships, practice relentlessly, and remember to be human in your interviews. When that final offer comes through, all the coffee chats, math drills, and sweaty-palmed networking events will feel totally worth it.",11,1737933157.0,MBA,9,0.76,False

I woke up early today, Sunday, and decided to go to the wholesale club to buy something we needed. I know they don't open till 8am. I get there early and am parked across the parking lot, playing with my phone and drinking coffee.

I see someone go up to the door and just stand there. Then another. Then multiple more. A few are sitting in their car.

By the time they open, there are at least 10 people lined up to get in. Why?? There are no sales. There is no shortage on their paper towels. 

Why can't they just sit in there car? It was about 20 degrees out. They would rather stand in the cold to be the first ones in vs myself, who came in a few minutes after.

I've been experiencing  tinnitus for years and always chalked it up to going to clubs and concerts a lot in my 20s. About 4 years ago it seemed to intensify.

I've always had ear issues. In childhood, I could'nt  go very deep in a pool without feeling like my brain was going to implode. I used to love jogging, but as I got older the pressures in my ears made me temporarily lose my hearing until my heart rate came down. It didn't feel great.

Back to current day:  Tinnitus and one-ear hearing loss is worsening. In the middle of the night, I am often woken by a tickle of drainage  in my ear. It's wet. The sensation of trickling water over your tiny ear hairs is enough to almost bolt me awake. Sometimes I keep swabs on the nightstand to dry my ear. I am a side sleeper and it happens more in my right ear but not exclusively. 

Very bad headaches - but in the morning, and not during the day as much, though I drink coffee and it goes away. Basically I wake up feeling not that rested and ""hungover"" though I didn't drink.

I went to a doctor and tried to explain all this -  which is hard to articulate -and he told me to try to really keep your ears dry when you shower, sounds like you are getting water in them. And that was the end of that. It was such an abrupt end to the conversation that I felt like I must be crazy.  I want to go to a new doctor, but I'm wondering if there is something else I should be looking for to mention.  Does this sound like a CSF even though the headaches dont start until I wake up and improve later in the day? ( or am I so used to it so I not realize what feels like ""sinus pressure"" is a daily headache.)

It has changed my sleep for the better and quite frankly has been shocking to me. I only drank ONE cup each morning around 930-10am so clearly I had what I beleive was an extreme sensitivity to caffeine that left me tossing and turning most nights with broken and poor sleep more often than not.

Still, occasionally, rarely, about once every 2 weeks or so I've been having a cup of decaf coffee just to prevent myself from relapsing with a regular cup. Sometimes the cravings for the taste just get to be too much. I'm still a work in progress as far as relearning how to sleep better consistently after so many years of poor sleep. So last night I happened to have a bit of a rough night and woke up starting my day feeling tired. I ended up getting a cup of decaf in the morning and I must say as the day went on I ended up feeling completely shot at some points, almost about to fall asleep at one point and just feeling that typical old feeling of being excessively drowsy. Now again, I did have a poor night of sleep last night, but I honestly don't think it was this bad.

I'm wondering. Considering just how much ONE single cup each MORNING affected me for years, is it possible even decaf and its average of 7g of caffeine are having effects on me throughout the day? TIA",5,1737932735.0,decaf,13,0.86,False

After recently getting to experience the joys of downtown coffee life in for a couple of days in Seattle WA, coming back to the 8 dollar cup of ice that is caribou is largely disappointing and am looking to upgradey home coffee game. Will probably be used 1 or 2 times daily and prefer lighter roasted beans.

Firstly I am looking for an espresso grinder as the moka pot does a decent job but espresso selection is otherwise terrible. 

I've come across the baratza encore esp at around 200 which seems to be one of the more popular starting points in the espresso game. But wouldnt mind spend more for some extra headroom and not buying another one.

As for the espresso machine itself down the line me and the lady largely do milk based drinks so a decent brother would be nice. When I looked at machines a few years back it seems the pressure(bar)was a lot more of an issue, but I don't see that being advertised as much in the searching I have done. 

The gaggia e24 with the brass boiler seems neat but I don't know how much the new brass boiler changes anything or if other companies are doing the same thing at that price point.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

My dentist is giving me both a bonded retainer (behind all my top and bottom insicors) as well as removable retainer for night time. 
Before Invisalign I struggled with plaque badly, especially behind my bottom front teeth. 
I worked very hard with my hyginest and now have an amazing routine and no plaque. (I realise to some this is standard but I'm proud of myself!) 
Anyway when I heard how hard permanent retainers were to clean around I wanted to decline it but my front teeth have moved a lot! And I feel like they would just move straight back... Like I had a lot of gaps and teeth in completely different places/ positions. It wasn't a small correction. 
So my question is... Is how do I avoid cavities or plaque with the bonded retainer? And also out of curiosity do they stain? As in when I drink coffee will there be horrid discoloured blobs where it's attached? (I'm already drinking coffee through a straw to try to minimise the damage it can do to teeth and also staining) 
Would be so grateful for all advice! ",1,1737932603.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I attend festivals as well. If anyone is from Indiana, I was at the latest Covered Bridge fest and 5 previous ones! I have my mobile store and I’m license to set up shop at festivals! I’m from a small part called Cayuga. I feel like If you’re from Indiana then everyone knows each other because it’s a tight community.

I was a 3rd grade teacher. I want to teach again but I’m not sure when. I love kids! My final moments being in my 20s as well, hitting the 30s real soon! I used to play basketball. I was the best in my team and I would always dunk 3s and slam dunk on everyone’s head. I still hoop in the park, I’m a monster! I’m sporty, I like tennis and football as well but basketball is my bread and butter. I try to stay active when I can, run the tracks and bleachers at my old high school!

I made my world famous freshly squeeze orange and berry punch you in the face with dragon fruit puree make you drink it all juice today! I love fruit drinks! I also love coffee in the morning! Here’s a riddle if someone wants to solve! Solve it and you will be in for a world of fun! Maybe pain! Riddle riddle! “She once was a Turchi who ball until she falls! Now she’s a king, to rule them all! She lives in a land, Cayuga with fam, boutique in Illinois, it makes so much noise! 23 and is a goat, but a falcon she once was!”. Good luck!

Moments later I knocked the cup to the ground, fortunately the coffee only managed to splatter on the top of the shoes (suede), a little on the textile, and the laces. They are small dots, but I am heartbroken. I got home after an hour and a half, and didn't try to do anything. I have the same model of sneakers, and I used to handle them very carelessly, I wanted to keep the new ones impeccably clean, but oh well.

Can anyone advise me on what I could use? I'm afraid that the suede will discolor if I use water, or any homemade concoction. I also don't know how to clean the textile parts. I would prefer to buy something dedicated, but I don't know what would be suitable. Please help 🙏🏻

Since around this time 4 years ago there's been a few occasions where I was convinced I had a UTI, so I went to urgent care/out of hours doctors in a panic (I am prone to extreme health anxiety, so sometimes I convinced myself it was even spread to my kidneys).

 My third time getting checked was at the start of this year,none of these 3 times was their testing showing anything wrong w the sample. Sometimes I get random symptoms but they usually go away (either I was dehydrated so I chug water, or I may be particularly anxious which makes me wanna pee).

Anyways, there's likely nothing wrong w me, but I still get convinced there is. Nowadays I compulsively check my urine when I go, for colours and smells (literally always looks perfect, never cloudy but anyways, and only smells if I drink coffee or have strong flavours like lots of garlic/spices). 

Back in 2021 there was even a time where I had to essentially do an at home pee sample nearly every time I went to make sure things looked okay in a non diluted bottle. (haven't done that since thankfully)

The main thing I do though (have been doing it since I went this year to the urgent care and they found nothing) is set a stopwatch every time I pee and see how long I can go between. Mind you, I drink tons of water to make sure nothing ever hurts or gets infected. So even if I did have frequency, it's probably because of that. But my frequency of urination is within normal ranges. 

anyways, sorry this is so long, i was just wondering if anyone else does the timing thing or has a similar experience. ty",3,1737931961.0,OCD,0,1.0,False
