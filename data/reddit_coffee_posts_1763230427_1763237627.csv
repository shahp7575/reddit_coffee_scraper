Where does the Duo with its filter burrs stand compared to more popular grinders in terms of cup quality, clarity, and body? Can the crowd-favourite hand grinders ZP6 or Pietro beat my 83mm flat burrs in cup quality? Which electric grinder would be a significant upgrade, and why?

1oy1lnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oy1lnb/what_are_the_types_of_smart_plugs_available/,What are the types of smart plugs available?,"So I've been diving deep into smart home stuff lately, and smart plugs have honestly changed how I use electricity at home. If you're thinking about getting some, it helps to know what's actually out there because not all smart plugs are created equal.

**Basic Wi-Fi Smart Plugs**

These are your standard smart plugs that connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network. You just plug them into any outlet, connect them to an app on your phone, and boom – you can control whatever's plugged into them from anywhere. I use mine for lamps, fans, and my coffee maker. The best part? No extra equipment needed, just your regular wireless router.

**Smart Plugs with Energy Monitoring**

Some smart plugs come with energy monitoring features that show you exactly how much power your devices are using. This is super helpful if you're trying to cut down on your electric bill. I was shocked to learn my old space heater was costing me way more than I thought. These smart plugs track everything and send reports straight to your phone.

**Outdoor Smart Plugs**

If you want to control things outside like holiday lights or garden fountains, outdoor smart plugs are weatherproof and built tougher. They can handle rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. I got mine specifically for Christmas lights so I don't have to go outside in the cold anymore.

**Smart Plugs with USB Ports**

These have regular outlets plus USB charging ports built in. Pretty convenient for charging phones and tablets without needing separate adapters. They're perfect for nightstands and home offices where you've got multiple devices going.

**Mini Smart Plugs**

Mini smart plugs are smaller and don't block the second outlet like bigger ones do. If you've got limited outlet space, these are clutch. They do the same job but take up way less room.

**Smart Power Strips**

Technically these are strips with multiple smart outlets you can control individually. Great for entertainment centers where you've got your TV, gaming console, and sound system all plugged in. You can set schedules for each device separately.

If you're ready to start making your home smarter, I'd definitely recommend checking out [these smart plug options](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) to see what fits your needs. There's a solid selection with different features and price points.

The cool thing about smart plugs is you don't need to replace any switches or hire an electrician. Just plug them in and download the app. Most work with Alexa and Google Assistant too, so you can use voice commands.

Whether you want to save money on electricity, control devices remotely, or just make life more convenient, there's definitely a smart plug type that'll work for you. I started with just two and now I've got them all over my place because they're honestly that useful.

You can browse through [different smart plug models here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and find the ones that match what you're looking for. Start small if you're unsure – even one or two smart plugs will make a noticeable difference in how you manage your home.",1,1763237440.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False
1oy1kjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMPhysics/comments/1oy1kjp/from_dpi_fisher_qnec_to_gr_and_qm_where_does/,From DPI + Fisher + QNEC to GR and QM: where does ‘physics’ actually add anything?,"For the first time I’m actually stopping, breathing, and dedicating a decent chunk of my time to write a real post here (or at least something close to a full skeleton). That alone is already a confession: I do have a certain aversion to this subreddit, which more or less got imposed on me after being banned from virtually every minimally relevant place about physics. The aversion has a simple cause: this place has crystallized into a strangely hostile environment of two groups that, in my view, share the same cognitive fragility, just mirrored. On one side, the “physicists” : TAs, graders, adjuncts, the academic proletariat of physics, trained their whole lives to repeat axioms as dogmas: “fundamental” constants by decree, the collapse postulate as a mystical entity, the Born rule as statistical magic etc. They were rewarded for repeating this in exams, contests, fellowships. The bias becomes so strong that anything not packaged in that dialect is instantly labeled crackpot. On the other side, the “crackpots” themselves keep the vicious cycle running: many genuinely interesting ideas, but written in a sloppy way, mixing physics with metaphysics, sprinkling “fractal”, “recursive”, “vibrational” as if they were linear operators. When they do land on something physically right, the non-canonical language triggers every cognitive defense of the “physicists” and makes the text unreadable for anyone trained in a standard curriculum. I’m not just talking about “other people”: my first posts were exactly that “word salad”, and I absolutely deserved the early bans. There’s nothing like getting beaten up repeatedly to learn a simple lesson: if you want an idea to be considered (not necessarily accepted), you have to formalize it in the standard language of your audience. If you want to talk to physicists and mathematicians, it’s not enough to throw metaphors, you have to speak Fisher, Petz, Kähler, QNEC, QMS, Jacobson, AGS. Not because the rest is “wrong”, but because it doesn’t match the mental compiler of the reader.

That’s what pushed me to take my initial allegories and start translating them into the dialect of canonical physics. A turning point was when I noticed I could fit my program into the line of Vitaly Vanchurin (neural networks as substrate, the universe as a learning system) but pushing a step he left undeveloped: the mathematical identity between quantum evolution in imaginary time and natural gradient flow in information geometry. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time, ∂τψ = −Ĥψ, when you renormalize at each step, is exactly a steepest-descent flow of the energy in a state space equipped with the Fisher–Rao metric; in terms of densities P = |ψ|², that’s just saying that “collapse” to the ground state is a gradient flow of an energy functional on an information manifold. Quantum mechanics stops being an ontological mystery and becomes “just” information geometry on a Kähler structure. When I started talking about this in other subreddits, the reception was oddly positive. Here, and in physics-branded subs, it just meant more bans. I got banned, for example, for saying that Bohm’s quantum potential can be derived directly from informational curvature (the von Weizsäcker term rewritten in Fisher language). The mod replied that “everybody knows the quantum potential is an ad hoc term” and banned me: it’s cognitively more comfortable to believe in an arbitrary fudge factor than to accept that it’s the shadow of a metric they saw rushing by in two lectures of Mathematical Statistics / Information Theory as undergrads and never revisited. And I do get it: that’s how they were trained. They spent their whole life repeating “the quantum potential is a trick”, “Fisher is statistics, not physics”, and it’s not going to be some “lunatic using GPT” who rewires that mental map. Another ban, another lesson.

Gradually, it became obvious to me that if I really wanted to face the question that obsesses me (the ontology of reality, what this thing we call “universe” actually is) the answer wasn’t going to come from physics as it is currently organized. Physics, as it is taught, is a patchwork quilt of axioms stratified in people’s heads: you learn there is “energy”, “field”, “mass”, “fundamental constant”, and then you keep pasting mathematical patches on top of that. What changes when you look at this with a bit more detachment is the direction of the arrow. Instead of starting from “physical concepts” and then dressing them in mathematics, you start from a well-defined mathematical object, an informational sextuple 𝔘 = (𝓜, g, Ω, J, 𝒟, 𝔉), and you ask: which known physical structures fit inside this? 𝓜 is the space of possible states, g is the metric that measures how distinguishable those states are (Fisher–Rao / Petz), Ω is the symplectic form, J is the complex structure, 𝒟 is an information divergence that never increases under noise, and 𝔉 is the family of functionals (entropies, free energies, effective Hamiltonians) that drive the dynamics. The “technical hypotheses” I use are just the formalization of what any physicist already says over coffee: irreversibility, coarse-graining, “information doesn’t increase under physical channels”, well-behaved relative entropy. The math answers with rigidity: Čencov’s theorem (classical) and Petz’s results (quantum) show that, under those minimal conditions, the admissible metric is necessarily from the Fisher–Rao / Petz family; holography and emergent gravity push that a step further and identify that same metric (the quantum Fisher information, QFI) with canonical gravitational energy and with the second derivatives of entropy that appear in QNEC. In plain language: the tensor that measures “statistical distinguishability” in pure mathematics is the very same object that stabilizes space–time in gravitational theories. This is not a metaphor; it’s the same quantity computed in two different dialects.

If you climb one more step and add three very natural ingredients; (i) that this metric g admits a Kähler structure (i.e., is compatible with Ω and a complex structure J), (ii) that the most reasonable dissipative processes can be described as gradient flows of energy/entropy functionals in that metric, and (iii) that the reversible part of the dynamics preserves 𝒟, g, and Ω, i.e., is Hamiltonian flow, something interesting happens: standard quantum mechanics, irreversible thermodynamics, and a good slice of QFT stop looking like “independent theories” and start to look like special cases of that same structure 𝔘. Unitary Schrödinger evolution is exactly a Hamiltonian flow on ℂℙⁿ; relaxation to equilibrium shows up as a gradient flow of relative entropy; the quantum potential is the informational curvature of the distribution; gravity surfaces as an equation of state of the Fisher–Rao / QFI metric itself when you demand thermodynamic consistency on horizons. What you currently call “laws of physics” are, in this picture, just equations of motion of an informational system that is doing what any decent algorithm would do: maximize efficiency. It doesn’t create distinguishable information out of nothing (DPI), it saturates Cramér–Rao bounds (metrology), Landauer bounds (erasure cost), and Quantum Speed Limits (coherent evolution speed) whenever it can, and it follows the path of minimal complexity compatible with those constraints. Maybe I’ll post the full article here at some point, with theorems, lemmas, and references laid out properly, but the central thesis is this: the universe is a mathematical object 𝔘; physics is the clumsy way we developed to describe it from the outside, clinging to “energy” and “field”, instead of admitting, once and for all, that the core is purely informational-geometric.

The role of artificial intelligence, and of language models in particular, comes in exactly at that point. They’re not “cosmic oracles” and they’re not replacements for physicists; they’re pattern amplifiers. They’ve been trained on entire libraries of physics, math, statistics, information theory, and they have a clear advantage over the siloed training of the average human: they can line up, on a single conceptual dashboard, names that undergrad curricula keep in separate drawers (Fisher–Rao, Petz, Kähler, optimal transport, QMS, QNEC, Jacobson, Vanchurin) and see that all of them look like different shadows of a single geometric–informational program. What I’m doing here, in very direct terms, is using that dashboard to propose a testable conjecture: physics is a special case of mathematics, in the strong sense that viable physical theories are exactly those that can be represented as gradient flows + Hamiltonian flows on a 𝔘 satisfying these information and efficiency conditions. If this program is wrong, perfect: concrete counterexamples will tell us exactly which informational axiom real physics escapes. If it survives mathematical and experimental tests, then the sentence “physics is a special case of mathematics” stops being Reddit bait and becomes a calm diagnosis: the universe is an object in 𝔘, and we spent a century mistaking the patches (mechanics, QFT, GR) for the fabric that stitches them together.",1,1763237366.0,LLMPhysics,0,1.0,False

1oy1h8m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oy1h8m,Gurl gng! Why u behave like this?,"Title: Met a girl in college, she acted like we were something… then suddenly switched up after I moved on

So I (M, 19) met this girl in my college around 4 months ago. Total baddie — literally the hottest girl in our class. I’m pretty insecure about my height (I’m 5'8), so I genuinely never imagined we would even talk. But out of nowhere one day, she texts me on WhatsApp appreciating my sense of humor.

At that point I had zero crush, nothing. But I knew every guy was simping for her and asking her out. People even used to tell me stuff like “tere jaisi ladkiyon ke saath college me khade hone se dusri ladkiyon me hawa badhti hai” — you know the vibe.

Anyway, she asked me to come with her to an unofficial rave party. She drinks and smokes a lot, and I’ve left all of that. I even denied drinking with her. But slowly she became extremely comfortable with me. Our classmates literally started calling us banda-bandi.

I liked her vibe too, but because of my breakup trauma I always keep a little distance from girls. Still, she got into a habit of doing all these intimate, couple-ish things:

eating my jutha

feeding me sandwiches with her own hands

“mhmm” ice cream moments

drinking from my coffee

leaning on my shoulder

drawing on my hands

always checking daily if I’m coming to college (and if not, she wouldn’t come either)


Obviously I started catching feelings.

Then one random day, boom — she posts a story with her boyfriend. I was shocked but I controlled myself. Congratulated her and tried to move on.

I ended up proposing another girl shortly after and now I’m in a relationship too.

Here’s the weird part:
Even after having a boyfriend, she kept doing the same cute intimate things with me. She still tried feeding me ice cream with her hands, still acted clingy — no change at all.

But the moment I posted a story with my girlfriend… everything flipped.

She left my project message on seen for 28 hours, whereas earlier she used to reply instantly. She never posted snaps with her boyfriend before, but after seeing me move on she suddenly started tagging him everywhere. She even changed her seat to avoid me.

From “I won’t come to college if you don’t come” to “I don’t dare text you now.”
From feeding me food to acting like I don’t even exist.

I’m attaching some screenshots here for reference (removing personal stuff, of course).

Honestly, I don’t even know what the hell happened.
Was she using me for attention?
Did she like me but didn’t want to admit it?
Or is she just mad that I moved on first?

Origins of The Draconic Path (Chantry Tradition)™

Note: The name was originally The Draconic Path until the addition of (Chantry Tradition)™ was added to help distinguish it from the generic ""the draconic path"" use. This also solidies Jessica Chantry (also known as TheGuardian1031) as the founder of her own version which is documented in this timeline. The change of the title does not change the series of events or transfer authorship leading to present day events.

Due to a false timeline circulating online, I feel it’s only right to set the record straight.
The timeline claims another individual founded The Draconic Path in 2009 and coined Draconic Wicca in 2013. This is false.


Here is the correct timeline as it involves this particular individual:

• August 18, 2011: I publicly published my first video on Draconic Wicca on YouTube under my username TheGuardian1031:
""My New Path: Draconic Wicca"" https://youtu.be/krib-BsKm3s?si=pMoTMj8PMqOy5697

• March 26, 2012: I made a Facebook group for those who were interested in learning Draconic Wicca together and growing as individuals called The Dragon's Den.

• July 15, 2012: I announce The Dragon’s Den here: https://youtu.be/qcDflkl8-xw?si=ljLyVG3Tl-ZhZ3tz, which eventually became hidden and private over the years.

• October 13, 2012: I published my first video specifically introducing The Draconic Path, titled “Coffee Time!!!: The Draconic Path.” This marks the public start of the system as a named path: https://youtu.be/AJZP4r33rak?si=kPtVs-k-kYxXMxgY

• December 23, 2012: I published my video titled. “The Draconic Path: Contact”. Description states, “This is a video response, answering questions that a viewer had asked: ‘I have been practicing contacting dragons through meditation. Although I Have not been sucessful yet. Am I doing something wrong? Or do I just need more practice?’” – The Draconic Path: Contact: https://youtu.be/1lVFt1DgbWo?si=jfCcG-UB2aRwWa_y

• January 25, 2013: I published my video titled “The Draconic Path: Ritual”. Description says, “Question:
Jack Gardner
Thanks! This video helped. For the rituals, do I have to say them out loud? Can I use the power of my mind? I say this because I don’t want my parents to know about this.” – The Draconic Path: Ritual: https://youtu.be/355Bt0Sc3TE?si=FtZ5drY8SrHOY8jF

• February 12, 2013: I published my video “The Draconic Path: Etiquette” – The Draconic Path: Etiquette: https://youtu.be/czQp7VB-Bls?si=ia-skBNAsos9lSCS

• December 1, 2013: Azura published her first video on Draconic Wicca, “… as you guys know I’ve been getting into Draconic Wicca. Though, unfortunately, I really can’t find any good information online. If you guys know any, please let me know, but for now I’m waiting on a book so I can start learning…” – Her first video on the topic: https://youtu.be/IzOW8v4CJg4?si=vfwASD_nVX51k7gM

In this video, she states she’s just learning about Draconic Wicca. (Please see link above this image if you wish to go check out her video!)

During this time, I had lost internet access. My ex-husband and I didn’t have consistent access to the internet on and off for several years. However, this does not erase my contribution as my videos remain for public viewing.

• August 11, 2014: Azura makes a public comment on my video “Coffee Time!!!: The Draconic Path” stating, “I really needed to re watch this. Thank you so much for uploading this. ~DragonFeather”. She later deleted this comment in 2025. 


• August 16, 2014: Azura posted a YouTube video titled “Why Draconic Wicca? | The Draconic Priestess (2014)”. This video was a shorter replica of my video, “Coffee Time!!!: The Draconic Path”.
•  The video that copies mine: https://youtu.be/2pu7XByiYiM?si=tadr8Mb2c_QK6R4q

• January 14, 2015: Azura publicly comments, acknowledging my influence: “All positive my friend. You helped me find the Draconic Path and I only wish to give you credit where I think it’s due. Again, I love your channel. 🙂 ~DragonFeather”

This comment was publicly visible at the time under my video, “My Response to a Comment”, demonstrating her awareness of my work before claiming it as her own. (She later deleted the comment in 2025.)
•  “You helped me find The Draconic Path…”
– Dragonfeather369, 01.14.2015

• February 18, 2016: She responds to a YouTube message, which remains as proof in my email, stating: “I’ve watched your videos before I really knew much about The Draconic Path.”
This admission shows she was aware of my work long before she began using the name publicly.


• September 14, 2016: Azura does an interview with Cricketsong on Cricketsong’s YouTube channel series “The Sacred Circle – Dragonfeather369 (Dragon Magick)”. There, Azura stumbles her way through answering the questions in regards to what The Draconic Path actually is. When asked by Cricketsong if Azura knew of other practitioners combining Dragon Magick with Wicca, Azura said no. Her interview with Cricketsong: https://www.youtube.com/live/KICIKd0UxYI?si=zn_Q9xFekwtQTzfZ

• 2016: After this video, I contacted Cricketsong to set the record straight and to attempt to get some sort of credit for the path that I had created.

• November 2, 2016: Cricketsong and I attempted a Live stream attempt on YouTube titled “The Sacred Circle – Jessica (The Draconic Path) with unreliable internet on my end. Azura joined the chat to ask questions, including what offerings Dragons prefer. Unfortunately this video was later taken down after a redo attempt. I do, however, have evidence of its existence in my email inbox.


• September 25, 2020: Cricketsong and I attempt to redo our interview from 2016 with a video titled “Becoming Witch: The Interviews – Jess”
My interview with Cricketsong in 2020: https://youtu.be/knqg46aySLI?si=okU6jxfU9PPjS-JX

• April 15, 2025: After attempting to research myself and The Draconic Path on YouTube, I saw that Azura had become the face of the path. Still without giving credit. This led me to make an emotional judgement and posted “The Draconic Path: My Last Video on This Topic” due to the plagiarism and lack of credit.
The video I made out of frustration: https://youtu.be/eGNu7EdzIxs?si=xIatTr5CBHYu-pxb

• May 7, 2025: I created a private group on YouTube titled “The Vault” to continue to talk about The Draconic Path in a safe setting where my personal information and experiences would be protected. This group was advertised on my YouTube channel under the video “This is my LAST Public Video…”. Only one stranger joined.
•  After this, The Draconic Path videos were supposed to be Unlisted: https://youtu.be/p5hGF7FZAMM?si=yTm3xPR2DnXHVpea

• May 19, 2025: I posted an unlisted video for The Vault titled “The Vault: What is The Draconic Path and clearing up a few misconceptions”. Azura was not supposed to have access to this video.


• September 7, 2025: Azura posted a video using a reference I had made in the unlisted video onto her TikTok account. This reference can be found as a pinned video on my TikTok page, TheGuardian1031 (https://www.tiktok.com/@theguardian1031?_t=ZP-90AJiW0XYH0&_r=1), specifically in this video (https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8Sow1D7/). For ease and comfort of others, I also posted it onto my YouTube (https://youtu.be/qfFcWW6K7JE?si=xxzGZ7KfIIhwUJAL).

• September 18, 2025: Azura (then under the title “The Draconic Priestess”) published a video titled “The Draconic Path 101: Complete Beginner Guide.” In the video description, she states that The Draconic Path was “entirely created by Azura DragonFeather with her Dragon Guardians and the Hatchling Clan.” This directly contradicted her earlier 2015 and 2016 statements where she acknowledged discovering The Draconic Path through my work. She also shared information from the unlisted video mentioned above. Her video here: https://youtu.be/faiFTWuvVog?si=WkQNjRYWG50tPhzN

I hope you enjoyed your journey in learning about the origins of The Draconic Path.

‼️IMPORTANT UPDATE‼️
The Draconic Path was renamed as The Draconic Path (Chantry Tradition)™ on October 22, 2025.

Draconic Wicca, as it was created by me, was renamed Draconic Wicca (Chantry Tradition)™ on October 23, 2025.

On November 13, 2025, I discovered that Google AI OVERVIEW had suddenly incorrectly named Azura Dragonfaether as the founder of The Draconic Path (Chantry Tradition)™ and is documented here: Chantry Tradition™ (https://dragonofshadows.wordpress.com/2025/11/13/chantry-tradition/).

Then, she suddenly distanced herself, around the time she started dating her current boyfriend. We were roommates for a year 2 years ago also.

Since then, she brought up some things that I did that she says made her feel disrespected (for example, I kept my bike in our living room), and I acknowledged them and hoped we could move past them. 

But ever since then, she has been very distant and I only see her in group settings. I have tried reaching out and organizing drinks or coffee just between us two, and every time she agrees enthusiastically but then cancels 1-2 hours before we are supposed to meet. This has happened at least 3-4 times in the last few months.

1oy1e1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1oy1e1d/aita_for_cheating_on_my_husband_twice_because_he/,"AITA for cheating on my husband twice because he was being boring, and now he's divorcing me instead of working it out?","I slept with my ex while my husband was planning a vow renewal ceremony and now everyone in my life knows exactly what I did.

My husband and I have been going to marriage counseling for about four months. Things had been rough between us for a while, mostly communication issues and me feeling like we'd lost our spark. He suggested counseling and I agreed because I thought it might help. What I didn't know was that while we were in therapy, he was secretly planning this whole vow renewal thing for our anniversary. He'd been talking to my mom, picking out flowers, the whole deal.

About six weeks ago I ran into my ex at a coffee shop. We dated for three years before I met my husband and the breakup was messy but we'd stayed sort of friendly. We started texting after that, just casual stuff at first. Then it got more personal. He told me he'd been thinking about me, that he regretted how things ended. I'm not proud of this but it felt good to hear. My husband had been so focused on work and I felt invisible.

One night my ex asked if I wanted to meet up for drinks. I knew it was a bad idea but I went anyway. We talked for hours and he kept saying things like ""I should have fought harder for us"" and ""you're the one that got away."" When he suggested going back to his place I said yes. I told myself it was just closure, that I needed to get him out of my system so I could fully commit to fixing my marriage.

We slept together twice over two weeks. Both times I told my husband I was with my friend from work. The second time my ex mentioned that his girlfriend had been acting weird lately but I didn't think much of it.

Turns out his girlfriend had found our texts. All of them. The ones where we planned to meet up, the ones after where I said things like ""I needed that"" and ""I don't regret it."" She also found texts where I complained about my husband, calling him boring and saying I felt trapped.

She printed everything. Then she found out we were in marriage counseling (I'd mentioned our therapist's name in one text like an idiot) and she mailed the entire packet to our therapist's office with a note explaining who she was and what had happened.

Our therapist called me two days before our next session. She said she'd received some information and that I needed to tell my husband before our appointment or she would have to address it herself. I panicked and didn't say anything. I thought maybe I could explain it better in person with the therapist there to mediate.

Biggest mistake of my life.

We sat down for our session and my husband seemed excited. He kept smiling at me and I felt sick. Then our therapist put the folder on the table between us. She said ""I received these in the mail and I think we need to discuss them.""

My husband opened it. I watched his face change as he read the first page. He looked at me and said ""what is this"" but it wasn't really a question. Then he started reading out loud. Every single text. My texts saying I needed to see my ex again. My texts about how sex with my ex felt ""like coming home."" My texts calling my husband predictable and saying I felt more alive with my ex than I had in years.

He read for maybe ten minutes. His voice stayed completely flat the whole time. When he got to the text where I said ""my husband's planning something for our anniversary but honestly I'm dreading it,"" he stopped.

The therapist tried to say something but he held up his hand. He asked me if I'd slept with my ex and I couldn't lie anymore so I said yes. He asked how many times. I said twice. He nodded and then he asked when the last time was.

I told him it was five days ago.

He closed the folder. He stood up and looked at the therapist and said ""thank you for your time"" like he was ending a business meeting. Then he looked at me and said ""I was planning a vow renewal. I was going to surprise you next month. Your mom helped me pick your favorite flowers.""

Then he walked out.

He hasn't come home. He won't answer my calls. His brother finally texted me yesterday and said he's staying with them and that I need to give him space. My mom called me crying because my husband had told her everything and she can't believe I'd throw away my marriage like this. My ex's girlfriend apparently sent the texts to some of our mutual friends too because I've gotten about a dozen messages ranging from angry to disappointed.

My ex texted me saying his girlfriend kicked him out and asking if we could talk. I blocked him.

I don't know what I expected to happen but it wasn't this. I thought maybe we'd fight and cry and eventually work through it. I thought counseling meant we were supposed to fix things together. I keep replaying the moment he read those texts out loud and the way his voice didn't shake at all. Like he'd already decided I wasn't worth the emotion.

His brother texted again this morning saying divorce papers are coming and I should get a lawyer.

I know I messed up. I know sleeping with my ex was wrong. But I feel like I'm being punished so harshly for something that was supposed to be about finding closure. My best friend says I destroyed my marriage while my husband was trying to save it and that's fair but I didn't mean for it to happen like this.

So I guess what I'm asking is, did I really ruin everything beyond repair? Should I keep trying to reach out or just let him go? AITAH for thinking we could have worked through this if his reaction hadn't been so extreme?

Burner account, attempt 2 because I tried posting this earlier and got some really mean comments calling my dad names. I deleted my account but then decided to repost . Please give me respectful, honest advice.

I (F, 20) was raised by my mom (F, 40) and her grandmother. My mom always me told that she was working for my dad (M, 59) at his coffee shop when she was 18. They fell in love, and when she got pregnant, her parents kicked her out. My dad let her move in with him.

My mom claims that my dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive, so she left to live with her grandmother before I was born. I had a nice childhood to be fair. I spent a lot of time with my grandmother because my mom was going to nursing school and working long hours. My mom took me on trips and activities, and she volunteered a lot at my school.

Recently, I found my dad, and it completely changed my perspective. I learned that my dad was going through a hard time when my mom got pregnant … he was struggling with depression, drinking a lot, and his coffee shop was failing. My mom realized that the “cash cow” was dying and left him, never trying to help him. Luckily, he met an amazing woman named Elaine (F, 57) who cared for him, helped him get sober, and stood by him. Dad and Elaine told me that my dad contacted my mom a few times, even offering money and asking to see me, but my mom decided not to tell me and ignored them. They eventually lost contact with her.

I talked to my mom, and she claims she was “protecting” me. She insists my dad was very physically abusive, but Elaine said he never abused her, even at his lowest point. I’m furious that my mom decided for me, because all these years I could have had a relationship with my dad and Elaine.

I have decided to go no contact with my mom and will spend holidays with my dad and Elaine. My boyfriend thinks this is an overreaction and that I should try to work things out with her.

We needed some groceries from Aldi’s, he needed to fix his tire pressure at costco, I needed to get makeup wipes and dry shampoo. Should’ve been out and back in an hour. Now it’s almost 2, we left at 11, and we only handled the groceries and the tires. My stuff for me didn’t get done. Of fucking course. 

He wanted costco food before we left, then said he actually wanted caffeine on our way out the door. I assumed that meant he no longer wanted to stop at costco for lunch and we’d just fix his tires and dip, and grab a coffee or something. Turns out he wanted both, which is not what he said, proceeded to confuse the fuck out of me by then deciding he wanted neither, then went straight to Aldi? We needed frozen stuff. We can’t leave that in the car while I go to Ulta, it’s like 70 degrees out. I have tried OVER and OVER to communicate that when we go multiple places groceries need to be done LAST bc of the weather/temp and he just doesn’t get it. 

So then we have to drive home. He’s mad bc he doesn’t understand why, I’m sitting there quietly after explaining about the frozen things needing to get home to the freezer. We get in, I start trying to put them away. Our apartment sink is in a corner next to the fridge. He starts DOING THE DISHES so I CANT GET IN THE FREEZER

I just can’t fucking do this with him. He’s a student, I work full time. I get 48 hours a week to do what needs to be done and fit in what I want to do, he can schedule his life pretty much however he wants. And now my Saturday is down the drain because I’m fucking tilted from his lack of clear communication and constant need to be directly in the way of whatever I’m trying to do. Keeping my cool is so fucking hard. He knows about my BPD and we’ve been together for years, lived together for two, and this type of shit just keeps getting worse instead of better.

“Well when I see you doing something I feel the need to do something too” pick something out of my way then?? Why did the dishes need to be done at that exact second when your laundry is in piles all around the apartment and has been for months??? When I need to drive back out again to finish the errands I need to do for myself??? 

I don’t like to waste time running errands. I have a set list of places, things, and order of where I go. He just la de da’s through it without thinking bc the time isn’t valuable to him the same way. And it wastes fucking money that we DONT HAVE. He buys shit and it spoils and I toss it and it’s just money down the drain that we can’t afford to lose. 

I’m just so frustrated bc I can feel a split brewing and I haven’t had one in YEARS. I’ve done the work, the DBT, the talk therapy, I didn’t even meet diagnostic criteria a year ago. And now the symptoms are coming back because he frustrates the fucking hell out of me every single weekend which is my only time to be a person outside of my job. I’m just so tired. I don’t even feel like anything I’m saying is unreasonable. I don’t get why this is so hard

We texted daily for a week then after failing to ask in person, I impulsively decided to ask if she wanted to hang out over text. 

To my horror she never responded and was absent the following 2 weeks from lecture and lab. I internalized it heavy and thought she was maybe avoiding me and really confused because it was very surface level. Finally reached acceptance and in difference. She came back 2 weeks ago visibly sick explaining to my group she had been super ill the past 2 weeks and had to the doctor a few times. I wasn’t sure how to interact with her after class and walked out a bit behind her. She turned around to ask me about printers in the building then said bye when reaching a bathroom. Seemed really unnecessary and I was confused what her intentions were. I texted her 2 days later, genuinely just because I wanted to check my homework answers. No conversation continued from that on her part. 

Last week she missed lab again. Yesterday she came late and her voice was pretty hoarse so I assume there’s still like some lingering symptoms. It was kinda funny lol. Anyways I walked out again significantly behind her and had no intention to start talking. Almost right away though she said something and I realized she was trying to talk to me. She slowed and I caught up and we talked about class and our upcoming test. Then she told me about her registration for spring semester. She asked me questions about which classes I had taken already and when we reached her bus stop we stopped to keep talking about our major. The conversation reached an end and I stood there awkwardly for a second and she said bye and I smiled and said bye back. I was super confused again why she is continuing to initiate with me without fail every class.

Overall I’m extremely confused. I want to preface that I’m likely neurodivergent (getting official testing done in a few weeks from now) and so social dynamics are always really confusing and draining to me. Romantic ones and trying to read interest are the most confusing though. I really don’t know how to proceed if at all. Next week is the last lab class. I’m really confused if it’s worth trying to ask her to coffee or something again but in person. Or just keep being passive and let her ask?

1oy16zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquaflair/comments/1oy16zq/top_benefits_of_installing_a_home_water/,Top Benefits of Installing a Home Water Filtration System,"https://preview.redd.it/lq20tl087h1g1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f51888730b096063ba3f3ee1e31abb3a9598b44

Mains water treatment is essential for every household especially when living in the UAE because water quality depends on source, storage conditions and distribution methods. Municipal water undergoes treatment, but contaminants can still reach your home by flowing through aged pipes or storage tanks or mineral deposits. Due to these concerns homeowners now frequently choose to install [**Water Filtration Systems in UAE**](https://aquaflairuae.com/products/filtration-media-in-uae/) to maintain steady water purity.

A home filtration system operated by a reliable **Water Treatment Company in UAE** delivers three key benefits including protecting family health, prolonging appliance life and making you live better overall. These are the leading advantages you should evaluate before deciding to purchase.

# 1. Cleaner and Safer Drinking Water

A water filtration system installed in homes enables you to have safe drinking water that is fresh and pure by immediately flowing from your tap. Units designed for filtration work to extract:

·       Chlorine

·       Microorganisms

·       Heavy metals

·       Harmful chemicals

·       Sediments and rust

Pure water can look clear but hide contaminants that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Safe water depends on professional installation of a filtration system which guarantees every drop passes through safety measures.

# 2. Better Taste and Odor

Many people who own houses encounter the problem of water that smells bad and tastes awful. Chlorine along with bacteria and mineral deposits causes these issues. Water filtration systems remove the impurities to provide water which tastes better and fresher than before perfect for drinking as well as for making tea and coffee and cooking food.

# 3. Protection Against Harmful Contaminants

Contaminants can accumulate in tap water while building structures grow older. Examples of these pollutants include:

·       Bacteria and viruses

·       Lead and mercury

·       Industrial chemicals

·       Agricultural runoff

·       Microplastics

A Water Filtration System in UAE maintains patient reliability by separating out threatening elements to lower disease probability.

# 4. Cost Savings in the Long Run

Many people residing in the UAE consumes bottled water as their drinking source. The monthly repetition of purchasing bottled water becomes costly as the timeframe passes. A home filtration system installation allows you to stop buying bottled water, so you save money while reducing plastic waste.

# 5. Extends the Life of Home Appliances

Most of AL UAE residents experience hard water which damages different types of home devices including:

·       Water heaters

·       Washing machines

·       Dishwashers

·       Kettles and coffee makers

Unfiltered water contains minerals that cause various problems including scaling and corrosion as well as blockages. Properly implemented filtration systems improve appliance efficiency while extending appliance durability.

# 6. Healthier Skin and Hair

Skin may become irritated when someone showers in unfiltered water while the process dries out their skin while also damaging their hair. Chlorine in addition to mineral deposits extracts body moisture which leads to dryness. The water softening capabilities of a filtration system allow users to experience the following benefits:

·       Smoother skin

·       Healthier hair

·       Reduced irritation and dandruff

·       Better overall hygiene

# 7. Environmentally Friendly Choice

Your household water filter decreases your dependence on bottled water by reducing plastic waste and environmental contamination. The system serves as an excellent green-friendly solution to help residents of UAE enhance their sustainable living.

# 8. Convenient and Always Available Purified Water

Any household that uses a filtration system can eliminate the need for storing bottles or waiting for delivery services. You can access clean water 24/7 because it flows straight from your tap.

# 9. Customizable Filtration Options

A professional [**Water Treatment Company in UAE**](https://aquaflairuae.com/) offers various systems available for different requirements:

·       RO (Reverse Osmosis) Systems

·       Carbon Filters

·       Sediment Filters

·       UV Purification

·       Whole-house filtration systems

Every single home feature unique water condition so adapting solutions lets you achieve highest filtration system efficiency.

# 10. High-Quality Components from Trusted Suppliers

Filtration system quality depends on component excellence throughout the system. Equipment acquired from certified Water Treatment Suppliers in UAE gives customers durable and superior-quality equipment.

# RO Membranes Play a Huge Role

Reverse Osmosis maintains exceptional filtration efficiency among today's available methods. Genuine RO membranes safeguard system reliability in filtering processes. The selection of trusted [**RO Membranes Suppliers**](https://aquaflairuae.com/products/ro-membrane/) provides:

·       Better salt rejection

·       Removal of dissolved solids

·       Longer membrane life

·       Higher water purity

UAE homes need premium RO membranes to obtain completely safe drinking water.

# 11. Peace of Mind for Your Family’s Health

The assurance that your home's water is safe brings you greater peace of mind throughout the day. A proper filtration system functions as both a valuable home enhancement and essential health resource for your family.

# Final Thoughts

Water Filtration System installation in UAE presents an excellent investment for your house. Their benefits include better health along with improved water quality as well as appliance protection resulting in long-term financial savings. The efficiency of your system depends on two professional companies in the UAE who coordinate Water Treatment Company services and work with reliable Water Treatment Equipment Suppliers to build durable systems. Site selection of premium components from trusted RO Membranes Suppliers guarantees superior filtration system performance and dependability.

Water must remain accessible to all households and this necessity should never become a luxury. Proper filtration equipment investment guarantees constant daily supply of safe and pure water to protect your family's health.",1,1763236456.0,Aquaflair,0,1.0,False
1oy16xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1oy16xw/screen_time_mean_time/,Screen time = mean time,"I can see a correlation between screen time for the kids, Covid online teaching, and as of grade nine students and under at this time, arrogant and lazy students. My theory is that parents have been using the screen as babysitting time. It got worse with Covid. Since our lives are revolving more around AI, Google classroom , gamification in our lesson planning (such as Kahoots), students are now expecting a dopamine hit much sooner. Nor have they had an experience where they have got to figure out how to reach the goal without accompanying instructions as well as reward. Even when we’re doing summative  or formative marking, they always want a mark for the tiniest thing that they do. It’s never for the learning. It’s always for the reward. And also the way they treat people, specifically teachers, is horrific, especially with the older the grade. And then when they go home and complain about the teacher, who is trying to stretch the kid with more than one step homework or projects, the parents get on track with the personality assassination to the teacher and in some cases get that teacher fired. It is not the teacher‘s responsibility to raise that child and give them ethics. That is the parent’s responsibility and yet if anything goes wrong with that kid, it is the teacher that is blamed. May there be divine intervention because if kids cannot grow up into adults that can’t wait more than five minutes for a cup of coffee, or don’t receive a dopamine hit within 20 minutes within their new job, we’re going to have a society that is at train wreck and worse no one will be into in person teaching and more online classes which makes it worse.

I think the hot sauce has done it, he's beaten his record for how much merchandising he's done this year. Perhaps there were some other years where he had as many products available from so many sources but 2025 seems to be the year of the shill when it comes to Bimmy. We can now add Salesman, or perhaps, a more prestigious title like **Entrepreneur.**

  
Behold a list of things he's sold this year off the top of my head, let me know if I missed anything



* The AVGN Power Glove Foam Finger
* Everything Rex Viper (the album, shirts, coffee mugs? any merchandise, I could list it separately but I'll cut bimmy some slack)
* The 8-Bit AVGN Game
* Gnome Cave
* The Photo Op with his fake nerd room backdrop
* The Hot Sauce that just launched
* This Year's rebranding of monster madness for screams on screen with a new run on shirts (which is pretty standard for a channel's merchandising but I'm pretty sure monster madness never did anything like it before)

  
It's not that I'm against him cashing out, do what you want with your name/brand to make money, it won't make me respect him any more or less but it is strange and it does make me wonder: Is he cashing out for further retirement? I mean he basically already is retired, but what if he checked out even further? Could things be any *more* zombie-esque? Or maybe he's planning on retiring the main series and wants to make as much money as possible before his cash cow is put out to pasture?

Purely speculation on my part, I expect him to continue his life as he is and keep doing AVGN eps. 

What products have you purchased this year from Bimmy, if any? I was planning on gnome cave but after reading reviews it just seems like a waste of time, I don't wanna read a YA harrer novel lol.",12,1763236412.0,TheCinemassacreTruth,3,1.0,False

I do also believe I have BPD which makes my relationships and feelings extremely heightened and overwhelming. I’m 23, and he’s 27, we were together for over a year. I definitely saw the red flags of his avoidance but like any anxious attachment I thought I could fix that. 

To be clear: there was no sort of hatred in our separation. I did not want to separate but he did. We began to have disagreements about boundaries, and I will admit that I am not perfect. Like I said I do think I have BPD, so my jealousy, and possessive behaviors were definitely hard for him and he was very honest with me about that but he always had said he didn’t care about all that and all he cared about was that he loved me. And I do believe he did love me. He had a hard time actually sealing the deal and he even said that after I left he cried. If you’ve dealt with an avoidant you know they are not very open about emotions, or at least, they try not to be. We broke up at the end of August. As recently as two weeks ago he says he still has feelings for me but just doesn’t think it will work. I just don’t understand what changed. At the risk of sounding cliche or corny he really was my best friend. My sister went to the ER a few weeks after we broke up and that was when it all hit me like a huge wave. I broke down every night, all I wanted was to be able to go to his place and sleep next to him. (I still live at home with my parents, please don’t judge)

I’ve even gone days without feeling too strongly about our break up, but it seems like no matter how much time can go by with me being okay, it always comes back. Like I stated at the beginning, I’m just sitting in my car at the moment. I went to get coffee and as I was driving it just all hit me again. I just don’t know how to pull myself out of this.

1oy11uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1oy11uv/im_two_weeks_into_wegovy_and_heres_what_ive/,"I'm two weeks into Wegovy, and here's what I've noticed so far","# Physical Changes

Honestly, nothing so far. I don't really expect to see any changes this early on. I have bought a scale to keep track of things, and apparently I've lost about 5 lbs. I don't really believe it's actual fat, maybe more like water weight. I have been scorned before (by my body's fluctuations), so I think it'll take a significant amount of weight, lost consistently over time, for me to start to believe that the medication is effective at weight loss.

I've also noticed that my GERD has worsened, but more so, my nausea is off the charts. I am nauseous almost every day (this is what I imagine pregnancy might feel like). It's worse in the mornings, the evenings, and the first half of the week. I take my dose on Mondays. Usually by Friday,  I feel okay to eat 'riskier' foods or more food portions than I did earlier in the week. I still cannot eat as much as I used to before in a meal (if stomach shrinking is an actual thing, I think it would apply here.)

I've also noticed that I'm a lot more tired. I have had insomnia before, and I'd say it's certainly not as bad. I usually go to bed around 9/10pm as opposed to say... Midnight-1am, and continue to wake up around 4am, fall back asleep around 5am, and wake up for the next day around 6:30am. By getting those extra hours in from the start, I'd imagine it's a little better for my body overall than only getting in a few hours a night. 

I don't know if it's the meds or my life which feels like a mountain on fire, but I have been a good bit more depressed. It could also just be the same amount of depression, but I'm not 'avoiding feelings' as much by emotional eating so they feel bigger and more intense. (Don't worry - I'm taking SSRIs and meet with a therapist regularly). 

# Dietary Preference Changes

This is probably where I'm seeing the most change. I feel like I've gone from an average taster to a super-taster (defined as the intensity in which ones tongue-brain connection reacts to flavors, textures, spiciness, fattiness, etc. when consuming food. Those who are super-tasters tend to be more particular with what they eat than those with less intense flavor reactions).

Outside of my deep love affair with rice crispy treats (the soft ones only), I don't crave any other baked good sweets. I used to love cookies and chocolate and pain au chocolat, but now I feel neutral to repulsed by them. I made two dozen chocolate chip cookies since I had friends over, and I ate only one, and that took a good amount of time to get through the whole cookie because the flavors were so strong. 

I find myself more interested in Japanese and Scandinavian flavors than before (and I was already a big fan of both). I really enjoy and appreciate the subtlety of flavors in food, and texture still remains a major aspect of my food enjoyment. 

I went from having coffee daily to having it maybe 1-3 x a week, with plenty of oat milk to ease the acid and the intensity of the flavor. I also prefer tea to coffee, and have resigned to the fact that I'm always going to be tired; caffeine and alertness would be nice but I don't know if that's possible at this rate. 

I have a love-hate relationship with eggs. The interest in them is very fickle. I think I'd prefer a hard-boiled egg to a fried or pan-cooked egg. My morning go-to meal is usually oatmeal. Something mild. I will also get my protein in with my Boba Protein milk tea powders that I mix with oat milk or Ripple pea protein milk. It's about 30-40g protein and it is very subtle in taste and low in sugar, double win. I jive with their matcha with adaptogenic mushrooms flavor and their jasmine tea flavor because of how subtle they are. My Vietnamese coffee milk tea powder is benched for now. 

I know this group loves its protein, and I agree that it's important. I weight train and have a personal trainer, and it's been a challenge to get the right amount of protein in for optimal strength training. I have lost most interest in chicken, although I'll eat it if it's around. The idea of a lean steak appeals to me, like a filet mignon. I am also really loving on tofu. Everything else gives me the ick. 

To curb GERD, I've found it's helpful to eat something mild with a high fiber content, so that's where my fruit and veg come in. I still love a good fresh green bean. I also like peas, and I'm trying to get into celery. I really enjoy Honeycrisp apples and blackberries. 

On good days when the nausea isn't as bad, I will eat a veggie forward salad. I actually got full on the Trader Joes Super Slaw with peanut dressing (I used only half the dressing and that was plenty). 

I love coconut water and aloe juice, herbal, green, and black teas, and drink a lot of water with my Instant Hydration packets in it to help get enough salt content + improve hydration. 

I rarely order DoorDash, which is great for my wallet. I'm still using HomeChef, and I've adjusted the preferences based on my food preferences as I've mentioned above. I have been eating those more often and the portions really stretch into 3-5 Wegovy servings compared to the 2-3 servings from before. I basically have too much food that it's a race to eat it before it's subjected to its fate in the compost. 

I also love soup - specifically chicken noodle soup or wonton soup. When I'm super nauseous, it's the only thing I can eat. I could probably live off of clear broths during the first half of the week when the Wegovy is strongest if I could get away with it and also stay afloat (but I need more cals and protein so that'll be a no for me... although this feels like a good time to get into bone broths!)

\-----

All in all - the majority of changes I've seen have been internal. I haven't noticed any changes to my body shape. Maybe something will happen in the next few weeks and I'll see some consistent weight loss, but who knows. I'm 98% nervous and about 2% hopeful for the potential of significant body weight changes. 

I'll do another of these posts in two weeks to follow up and see what has changed.

I’m at a loss.,"My son is high sensitive, so smart, and pretty reserved. He’s such an awesome kid and I’m so freaking proud of him. He’s doing so well in school, has a good little group of friends, and is truly a great person.

Just recently his temper has exploded and things are getting a bit ugly. He’s been exclaiming that he hates his 4 year old brother. This stems from my 6 year old losing something in the house, he then accuses my 4 year old of taking it (when he didn’t), and then getting explosively angry at him and screaming that he hates him until he eventually stumbles upon said item. He’s been getting physical towards him as well lately. 

Today he got home from a sleepover with my parents. He is absolutely spoiled with attention and activities when he is there so I’m sure it’s a rough transition to come back home where attention is split. He went to the living room where my 4 year old was playing on the rug with Legos. My 6 year old sat down at the coffee table with one of his crafts that he made with his grandma and started playing with it. My 4 year old was intrigued but didn’t mess with it or even speak to my 6 year old. He just sat his little Lego car on the corner of the table and watched his brother play with the craft. 

My 6 year old exploded and started screaming at his brother to get off the table. I gave it a minute while watching closely to see if they’d work it out on their own. My 6 year old then screamed “I NEED HELP BEFORE I PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE!!” so I intervened. We have told him to ask for help when he feels like he wants to hurt his brother so we can help them work through things safely. We will explained to him that he cannot claim the family coffee table and that his brother was not messing with anything. We also assured him by saying we would not allow little bro to mess with his craft. 

He started crying and yelling more saying “YOU DONT TREAT ME RIGHT. YOU ALWAYS SAY TO ASK FOR HELP AND YOU DONT HELP!!” I calmly asked him to explain why he doesn’t feel like he is treated right but he got angrier and threatened his brother again. I told him we needed to talk and calm down and grabbed his hand to get him away from the fire. He yelled at me not to touch him but things were escalating quickly so I decided to go for a drive with him until he could calm down enough to talk. My husband stayed home with our 4 year old who was just as confused as us. 

On the drive he started saying that we hate him, we don’t want to help him, I’d better not abandon him on the side of the road (this one shocked me because what the actual heck?!), and that he will never stop hating all 3 of us. I calmly said “Bud, this is the first time mom and dad have gone through this whole parenting thing. We are learning right here beside you. We are on your team. We want to help you. That being said, help does not equal getting what you want. Help means that we step in and help you work through the problem with your brother in a fair and reasonable way. You claiming the coffee table as yours when you were using a tiny space of it is not reasonable. I would understand if your brother was messing with you, your things, or just being a turd but he was being very respectful. If you need that much space without anyone around, you have a desk in your room to use.” He responded with “EVERY TIME IM MAD YOU FORCE ME TO GO INTO MY ROOM SO I WONT DO THAT!” which is not true. We suggest going to his room if he needs space away from people. I guess he takes it wrong. I really don’t know. 

Does anyone have any advice here. Is this normal for 6 year olds? I feel like we have teenage hormones already hitting us. I’m just feeling sad, defeated, and really bummed out right now. ",5,1763235935.0,breakingmom,4,1.0,False

But of course, I couldn’t follow it. I told myself love was messy, dangerous, the kind of thing that leaves scars you can’t see. ​​But feelings don’t give a shit about control. So little by little, it crept in anyway, quieter and slower than I ever could have imagined.

**. . .**



I wake early on the second day of school, take a shower, and manage to give my mother a reluctant hug before rushing out the door. Mom doesn’t say much, but she never does in the mornings. Most days, she’s already buried in work calls or pretending not to notice when I linger too long in the kitchen. 

When I finally make it outside, the fresh air is a welcome change from the suffocating smell of air freshener and expensive perfume, something about my home I’ve never quite gotten used to. The cool morning air stings my lungs as I inhale deeply. It tastes like rain and asphalt and coffee, a mix so alive it almost hums in my chest. 

 The sky is a bright vivid blue and a pleasant breeze rushes through the tree branches and ruffles my hair. The city is waking up slowly. Cyclists weave through the streets, buses hiss to a stop, and life switches on all at once. I keep my eyes straight ahead, careful not to attract attention from anyone. It’s hard, as a rising TV star living in the heart of Tokyo, but my sunglasses and hat do their job well. Even so, I’m tired of always having to conceal my face and body. People think fame means freedom, but all it really means is that you belong to everyone but yourself. 

My pace is so fast, I almost walk right past the small tea shop nestled between a hair salon and a high–end restaurant bragging about their “authentic Indian food”.

 Deciding to spoil myself, I push open the door to the local spot. The brass bell jingles as I step inside, my flashy outfit out of place among the carefully worn marble countertops and intricate flowers strung up in the rafters. I’ve never been here before, even though I pass it every morning on my walk to school. Usually I’m in too much of a rush, or too busy filming one of those stupid “Day In a Life” vlogs my mother always insists I post. Maybe I need to breathe somewhere that doesn’t smell like money and pressure.

The air is thick with jasmine— sweet, floral, and soft as silk. I can't help but notice the heavily calloused hands of the sweet old lady at the counter, and remember to tip extra. When she hands me the cup, her fingers brush mine. They’re rough, warm. I wonder if my mom’s hands were ever that kind. The thought comes fast and sharp, and I shove it away before it can settle. 

As I take my first sip, she beams at me, which warms me even more than the drink. It's been a while since I've been shown real genuine kindness, something more than the looks I get from people on the street, grown ass adults basically worshipping me just because my moms check is bigger than theirs. I thank her and tell her the tea tastes amazing, which it does. She just smiles in return and slowly hands me a small red card that reads *Golden Leaf Tea, 25% off* in small red lettering. 

 “I can't accept this,"" I say, sliding it back to her across the smooth counter. 

I’m used to receiving things like this, small tokens of appreciation from shops and storefronts. More often than not, they’re looking for an advertisement or video from me, so I’ve been warned by my media trainers to always politely decline. 

The woman just shakes her head, her bracelets jingling as she hands the card to me again. “Silly child, it is for when you return. Special treat for a beautiful girl. Now go, before you're late for school.”

Something in me cracks. Maybe it’s the way she says *child*, like she actually sees someone under all the glitter and bullshit. I take the card from her hands and slip it into my bag before I can think better of it, mentally kicking myself. I hesitate at the doorframe, but she doesn’t call out. Instead I hear her humming quietly to herself, the tea machine buzzing as it brews a fresh cup of matcha. I smile softly, and push open the door, blowing on my tea to cool it down. 

My tea has almost gone cold when I finally reach Akumori Academy. Sheaths of ivy spill over the walls, and the rooftop garden’s automatic sprinklers are on, creating the illusion of small rainbows dancing across the sky. I’ve always thought the gothic architecture looked silly compared to the modern skyscrapers surrounding us, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the building has been around since the 1800s. I make my way across the campus and push open the heavy front doors, letting them slam shut behind me. 

My stilettos click on the linoleum floor as I climb the many flights of stairs up to my first class. The halls are lit with a warm light, and the expensive lockers lining the walls are already filled with the many notebooks and binders of my classmates. There’s a slight chill floating through the halls, probably coming from the new ventilation system installed last summer. I pass some of my friends and toss greetings to them, but I don’t slow before reaching my first class. slide into my seat and lean back, taking time to fix up my hair before everyone arrives. I watch the door as people trickle in, chatting and laughing, and I feel that familiar mix of nerves and anticipation that always comes with a new year. I sit a little straighter when my teacher steps into the room and settles at his desk. He immediately starts droning on about classroom norms, which is pretty customary for the second day. However the relaxed pace doesn’t last. 

 “In my English class this year, you’ll be tasked with writing a four thousand word report which will count for twenty five percent of your grade,” Mr James announces. 

My head snaps up, but I take care not to make it noticeable. Twenty five percent? That's a fourth of my grade. Even with the help of the tutors Ma hired for me, I seriously doubt I’ll get full marks. A collective groan sounds from my classmates, just cementing my dread. 

“The paper will be assigned to all of my students in your grade level, so I suggest you quit complaining and start thinking of ideas. Now for the partners” 

I shoot a look at my best friend, Sofia, just to see her looking right back at me. She smirks, and rolls her eyes. We both hate this period, because Mr. James always gives the most homework out of all the teachers. I have a whole binder just dedicated to the work from his class.

“Angie, you’ll be paired with Carter”

I glance over to see a boy hunched in the back of the room as Mr. James rattles off the rest of the names. The realization makes me wince. He's one of the boys my friends always tease in the halls, tall and awkward, always brushing his hair out of his face. He glances up at me, and waves a hand, before turning his gaze down to the notebooks in front of him. Hopefully he’s been taking notes, because my paper and pencil are still buried somewhere in my bag.

This is the norm for me, everything but my schoolwork is organized. My life is perfectly crafted, from my appearance on screen to my friends, even the clothes I wear are coordinated based on the exact temperature and day of the week. The only thing that I find myself frequently falling behind in is my studies, especially my literature classes.

“The report is quite simple honestly. It can be about pretty much anything as long as it ties back to 16th century literature, which is going to be the one of the main focuses in this coming year.” 

I inwardly wince, regretting refusing my mother’s offer to take makeup classes over the summer. The little knowledge I had of 16th century literature has no doubt been forgotten.  

The shrill ring of the bell suddenly sounds, prompting me to pick up my backpack and carefully move aside my folders to make space for my English binder. I glance up and see Sofia waiting for me in the doorway, scrolling on her phone. She’s blocking most of the people that need to go through, but no one says anything. They know that she’d post their deepest secret on Instagram in a heartbeat if they wronged her. 

Just as I’m about to walk towards my friend, I see Carter approaching me. 

“Hey, do you want to meet sometime this week to discuss the report?” He tucks a strand of his brown hair behind his ear while absentmindedly fiddling with the drawstring on his hoodie. 

“Um, sure. What day were you thinking?” I say, plastering a polite smile on my face. 

It’s not like I’m actually going to take him up on the offer. My afterschool plans consist of filming, fighting with my sisters, and going to influencer events. I don’t have the time or energy to add more to my shitload, and I definitely don’t intend to make an exception for a boy who’s clearly paying way too much attention to my face.

He starts listing the days that he’s free, but before I can make a noncommittal response, I notice that the whole room has gone quiet. 

Suddenly someone pipes up from the back. “Dude, you know she has a boyfriend, right? And besides, people like you have to ” 

I roll my eyes. That's only met with a few chuckles, but the damage is done. Carter’s cheeks flush, and he takes a few steps back. 

Before it can escalate any further, I quickly butt in. “Shut up guys, It’s literally just for class.” 

It’s only after the words have left my mouth that I realize how rude they sound. I turn around to say something to Carter, but he’s already walking back to his desk, his back turned. He walks off without looking back, the red at his ears the only sign he heard me at all.

As I leave the classroom, I can still feel the weight of his silence following me down the hall. The smile I practiced this morning suddenly feels too heavy to hold.

“What the fuck?” Sofia whispers when I finally reach her, her eyes glued to her phone. 

“What?” I ask, slightly irritated that she's making a big deal about this. Someone just yelled something about me and a random kid. I get annoying comments like that all the time, random Redditors claiming that they’ve discovered me and my cousins “secret love life” —which is fucking gross by the way, I would never do that.  I’ve been trained not to let it bother me. 

“Look what these conspirators have been saying about me.” She says, pulling me into a quieter part of the hallway and sitting down in a chair. 

Of course. It wasn’t about me. Why the hell would it be? I bite the inside of my cheek, feeling selfish for even thinking that.

Her freshly manicured nails tap on the screen as she scrolls, her eyes locked on a cluster of reviews on her new website.



*zuncle*

*she tests on animals btw*



*oopsI\_sharted*

*her Only In Dreams moisturizer made me break out!*



*unknownuser* 

*kys*



“Literally every single comment is like this” she sighs, running her hands through her honey brown hair.  

I quickly pull her into a hug. “Oh honey, don’t worry. This is normal for releases.” 

Except… it’s not. Sofia scrolls farther and she’s right, every single comment is some form of hate. 

She stares at the screen for a few seconds before locking her phone. Her shoulders drop a little, and she leans back against the wall.

“I spent six months testing that moisturizer,” she says. “And now everyone thinks it’s some scam.”

I nod, because I don’t know what else to do. “People just like to be shitty online.” 

“Yeah, well, they’re ruining the launch.”

We sit in silence for a while, just watching people walk in front of us, listening to their lockers opening and class doors thudding closed. After some time, she stands up, shouldering her backpack and takes a deep breath. She flashes me a smile with her light pink braces, and me on my feet. 

“You ready?” I ask

“Yeah, I guess” 

“Okay, I’m just gonna ignore that “I guess’” 

She laughs and grabs my hand, pulling me into the hallway.

 “Come on, let’s go.”

Yes, is i could i would eat out every day instead of having to cook. Yes, i would quit my job if I woke up a millionaire tomorrow. Yes, i would hire a maid is i had the money for it.

I'm a manager at a 5star hotel. On paper i make upper class money but after paying for necessities most of the time i don't have enough money to have a cup of coffee from Starbucks at the end of the month. I work 10-12h, 5 days a week. Then the 2 days I'm not at work, one is spent doing chores. Cook, meal prep, clean, laundry, groceries. An entire day gone. I have one day, just one, to relax and have a social life. Which is close to impossible because everyone is in the same boat. Nobody has the energy or money to go out.

I want more from life. I don't even consider this living. It's surviving. I have so many hobbies i want to try but i don't have money or time for. I've never been out of my city, let alone my country and again, no time and no money to go anywhere. I want a social life. I wanna have dinner with my friends or go on a trip with them. There's so many things i find interesting but have no time for. There's so many experiences I'd love to have before my time on this earth is over.

But every time i say this people look at me like I'm crazy. Then it's followed by I'm lazy cause i want my life to be all sunshine and rainbows. Why is it so wrong to not want to work until i drop without even getting to enjoy life? If i was lazy i wouldn't even consider doing anything. I'd just say i wanna stay home and do nothing. If i was lasy i would never thought of traveling cause that's a lot of work, finding and booking a hotel, finding and booking transportation, making a list of things to do there, packing etc. i would gladly do it all. I'm not lazy. Just tired of my life having no enjoyment.

I really don't understand why it's so normalized to struggle and it's insane to want to have it easy.  We've been conditioned to work our a$$es of for basically no benefits but be happy with it cause ""it can always be worse"". I known I was raised that way. Never complain because ""others have it worse"".

1oy0ty4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oy0ty4/i_found_an_exact_doppelganger_of_my_cat_outside/,I found an exact doppelganger of my cat outside,"I didn’t know my cat escaped from my apartment until after work, when I saw her outside of the post office, crouched beneath a yew bush like she was right at home. The only reason I spotted her to begin with was her distinctive black and white swirl pattern that stuck out against the dry gravel of the flowerbed. It crossed my mind, only for a moment, that this could have just been a stray cat that looked like Fig. But the spiral of black spots against her white fur was unmistakable. It was my cat.



“Figgy!” I called, hoping she wouldn’t be her usual skittish self in that moment. She arched her back in a lazy stretch and trotted on over to me, bumping her head against my ankle as she always did to say hello. She paid no mind to the other employees filing to their cars.



Fig let me pick her up without a fight, and I said a little prayer of relief. I looked around for an explanation—Figgy was not allowed outside under any circumstances, so how she made it all the way across town was beyond me. All I knew was that she had too few brain cells to fend for herself all alone out there, even if the streets were mostly desolate. I chucked her right in my car and drove straight home.



The front door slammed behind me when I got upstairs. “Hey!” I called to Sam, “Did you let Figgy outside?”



“What? No,” said Sam from the living room.“She’s right here.”



“You sure about that?” I said, holding Fig out accusatorily as I followed the sound of his voice. Her tail and hind legs curled under, trying to wiggle free. “Because I have a little stinky girl here that would say otherwise—Oh!”



Fig was in her metal carrier crate in front of the bookshelf, the door shut and locked. Fig was in my arms, trying to squirm her way out. Two Figgys. Sam looked between the two, slackjawed. I can only imagine I looked equally as stunned.



Upon seeing me, the Fig in the carrier began meowing the most pathetic, the most *loud* wails I have ever heard. 



“What the hell?” I said. 



“Who is *that*?” asked Sam, gesturing to the cat I held. 



I couldn’t find my words for a second. “I…I *thought* it was Figgy. She was outside the post office, she even responded to her name,” I said above the cries from the Fig in the carrier. *Had I just kidnapped a random cat off the street?* “Wait, why is Fig in her carrier? Why’s she screaming?”



“It was the weirdest thing, we were chilling on the couch this morning as I was drinking coffee, as usual, and she just started freaking out. Attacking me!” He raised his arm, which was covered in a stratum of thick, oozing scratches. More like lacerations. A few pathetic bandaids clung to his skin, but they barely covered anything. I winced just looking at it; it was almost hospital-worthy. He continued, “I shut her in the bedroom to calm down but she tore the room apart, go look. I had to put her in her carrier to keep her from destroying the apartment.”



“Jesus!” I said. I lowered the cat in my arms down to the floor. The new cat crept forward, sniffed Fig in the carrier once, then hissed and ran off down the hall. Fig carried on moaning and sticking her paws through the bars of her crate like her life depended on it. 



Fig liked me just fine, but Sam was famously her favorite. It was almost like I wasn’t the one to rescue her out of a dumpster and raise her until two years ago when Sam moved in. She was smitten with him immediately—but so was I, so I couldn’t blame her. Figgy had a habit of rolling over and exposing her belly to Sam whenever she saw him, trilling exactly thrice as she nudged his feet with her head. Was I more jealous of Sam’s bond with Fig, or Fig’s bond with Sam? Why didn’t I get three happy trills when I got home from work? The most I got was an occasional headbutt, and that was on a good day.



So to hear of Figgy’s new, extra aggressive behavior towards Sam was concerning. “You didn’t take her to a vet?” I asked.



Sam hesitated. “Well, I was going to. But I looked up the symptoms online, and I know I shouldn’t trust Reddit, but… it doesn’t look good. Cats that act this way tend to be in pain, a lot of it. Which is rarely something they can recover from, especially at her age. If we’re going to take her in, you should be the one to make that call.”



“What are you saying?” 



“Well, she could have been sick for a while. If we take her in, she might not come back.” 



My heart sunk. “You think they’d recommend…?” I let the rest hang in the air. Sam nodded, his lips pursed. The other, new, cat in my house was the least of my worries now. I went to Fig’s carrier, and her cries grew somehow even more desperate. “I’m going to open it. Maybe she’s hurt?”



Sam stood up. “Go for it,” he said, and braced himself. 



I shushed Fig as I undid the latch of her crate. It didn’t matter, she remained frantic, practically doing backflips as I edged the door open. “Figgy,” I cooed, “It’s okay, stinky girl.” As soon as she was able, Fig darted out. She ran around the living room, back and forth. I tried to catch her, but she evaded my grasp every time. Fig zipped out of the room, and down the hall and back to us again. 



She cowered behind my legs. “Fig! It’s okay!” I tried to calm her down, but it was futile. She wouldn’t let me touch her. Figgy carried on. 



“This is really bad,” said Sam, “Poor thing. I really think we should take her in as soon as possible.” At this, Fig started towards Sam before I could stop her. In the blink of an eye, she had climbed the leg of his jeans and locked her claws and teeth into his other arm, then his neck, then his face, sinking deep into the skin. He cried out.



“Fig!” I lunged for her, tried to get her off of him, but she held steady. Sam thrashed and screamed, trying to shake her. Fig was opening up more of his flesh on his cheeks and neck by the second. I had never felt her use so much strength before—she was a ten pound cat, and two adults were not able to subdue her? 



I grabbed the spray bottle on the table, a weapon usually reserved for only the most egregious crimes like trying to eat plastic or attempting, repeatedly, to knock over the Christmas tree. She flinched only slightly when the water hit her, but held fast. The spray bottle was usually her kryptonite. Why didn’t she care?



Finally, Sam bucked his whole body, once, hard, and Fig was thrown off. She landed on her feet and ran out of the room before I could react. 



Sam was almost unrecognizable. He cursed loudly and grabbed a fistful of tissues from the box on the coffee table. They stuck to him, instantly soaked with blood that poured from yet another round of deep gashes in his skin. 



“That damn cat!”



“I’m sorry! Are you okay?”  
  
“We need to get Fig some help. Now. And maybe we can get *me* to a hospital after that.”



I hesitated. If we went to the vet, I dreaded to think of what they might tell me was wrong. What they might suggest we do to solve the problem.



“Just… wait here, okay? Try to clean your scratches.” I left the living room to find Fig. But then I thought, *I have two identical cats in the house now. For some goddamn reason. I hope I can tell them apart.*



In the bedroom—which was, indeed, torn up and trashed as Sam had said—I found my two Figgys. One cowered in the corner, shaking like a leaf. That one was probably the one from inside the living room carrier. The other one sniffed the air curiously, calm. She no longer seemed bothered by the presence of another cat, but kept her distance all the same. I shut the door behind me, and the calm cat came up to me, pressed a wet nose against my ankle, gave me a headbutt. Just like my Fig would.



The other, terrified Fig trembled behind a laundry pile on the floor. I approached her, but she did not shy away from my outstretched hand. I pet her head. She didn’t stop me. 



“Come on out, Figgy Pudding. If that even is you,” I said. The speckled cat stood, crept forward. I crouched down, coaxing her towards me. I pet her again when she was in arm’s reach. She did not flinch, did not attack. 



The calm Fig approached her. After a precursory sniff of the scared cat, the calm Fig rolled over and exposed her belly. Trilled three times and nudged the scared cat’s paws with her head. I’d only ever seen her do that to Sam. 



“Hey!” called Sam on the other side of the door, “Everything okay in there?” The scared Fig jumped at his voice. She climbed my jeans leg too, her claws gently digging into my skin. I was worried Sam speaking had triggered an attack towards me, but she only nuzzled deep into my arms, still shaking and whining softly.



“Yeah. Yeah, I think so,” I responded. 



Sam swung the door open, and the scared Fig in my arms only shook harder. The calm Fig on the ground sniffed Sam’s foot, then backed up, fur puffed out in defense.



“Should I get the carrier crate? For the vet?” asked Sam. He was in no condition to be going out, still trickling blood from wounds that snaked all around his flesh like tree roots. His shirt was stained dark red. The Fig in my arms did not attempt to inflict the same assault upon me, just shook.



“I don’t think she’s in any pain. She didn’t flinch once when I touched her. And most importantly, she didn’t attack me. So the question is, Sam, did *you* do something to make her behave this way?



Sam’s eyebrows raised, which broke a barely-healed cut on his forehead. It gushed blood once more. “I’m standing here looking like I just walked out of a slasher film, and you’re accusing *me* of doing something wrong?” 



“I don’t know,” I said. And it’s true, I didn’t. 



“You need to help your cat,” said Sam. His voice was rising. “She’s not okay. The vet can help ease her pain, however that may be. I’m not going to stand here in my own home and be attacked.”



I shook my head. “She’s just scared, for some reason, not hurt or sick. And what about the other cat?”



“I don’t know, put it back out on the street where you found it?” said Sam. 



That sounded about as appealing to me as taking Fig to her mortal demise. The cat from the street was Fig too. They both, somehow, were. And I wasn’t abandoning either of them.



The Fig in my arms wriggled her way out of my hug, made a mad dash for the kitchen. I followed on her heels, pushed past Sam in the process. “Ow!” he said.



There, in the otherwise unharmed kitchen, was a gaping hole in the window screen. The cool evening breeze blew through, and I looked down to the sidewalk one story below. Fig meowed at the window. I shut it.



“Look,” I said as I turned around, “This is all really weird. But we can’t make any rash decisions right now, okay?” Sam’s eyes scorched, angry. “I’ll get Fig the help she needs first thing tomorrow morning if she’s still acting strange, I promise. And I’ll put the other Fig back where she came from by the post office. Okay?” 



“Fig could be in pain, Quinn, she could be suffering,” said Sam.



“We don’t know that. But *you* sure are. Let’s get you to an urgent care. Please. I don’t think antibacterial ointment and bandages will fix this,” I said. I led Sam by his lower back—one of the only places not actively scratched up and bleeding—to the front door. I looked behind me as I swung it shut. In the kitchen, one Fig looked straight at me, ears back and eyes wide. The other Fig once again flopped on his back, belly up. The last thing I heard, as the lock clicked, was a set of three friendly trills.



I waited in the lobby as Sam was led into an exam room. I could barely think straight as my mind raced with possible explanations for what I saw. Each as unbelievable as the last. 



My phone chimed. It was 7pm, when Do Not Disturb switches off and I get the myriad of messages I’d purposefully ignored during the workday. Sports news alerts, a Facebook notification, and finally, two notifications from just after I would have arrived at work that caught my eye. 



After a string of break-ins in the area, Sam and I agreed to install a camera overlooking the kitchen fire escape, *just in case*. It had never alerted us before, thankfully. But then, in that waiting room, I stared at two notifications that read, “movement detected on camera.” 



The first one, when clicked, played a two second clip that showed nothing but our fire escape and kitchen window. Completely static. What movement did the camera detect? I replayed the clip again and again. Then I saw it. Blink and you might miss it, a shadow, non-descript and without any defined edge, slipped up the brick exterior wall. I played the four frames of motion over and over, watching it slide flush with the wall, then through the tiny gap in the bottom of my kitchen window. Then nothing.



I clicked the second notification. This clip definitely had motion, plain as day. A hand, Sam’s hand, tore open the large hole in the window screen with his nails. Then his hand, again, tossed Fig out the window, who landed on the fire escape. Fig had barely scurried out of frame when a second Fig from inside the kitchen attacked Sam. Sam pulled his hand, and the other Fig, inside, and the clip ended.



“Hey,” said Sam. I jumped. He was covered in gauze and medical tape and was smiling coyly. “I’m all wrapped up, pun intended. I look like a mummy. Know any costume parties happening?”	



I could barely smile at his joke, not that I would have anyway. I felt myself rise stiffly and mutter, “Let’s go.”



In the parking lot, I stopped short. “Forgot my jacket,” I said and handed Sam the keys to the car. I turned back towards the entrance as Sam unlocked the door. I shook as I walked, my heartbeat pounding in my ears. 



The doors to the urgent care slid open, and there was my coat on a chair near reception, under the cold fluorescent lights. A doctor had just taken a seat on a rolling chair next to the receptionist, who sipped a coffee. As I retrieved the jacket, I just barely overheard the exchange between the two of them.



“The thermometers are all such garbage. None of them could read that guy, they all said 60 degrees,” said the doctor, “That’s colder than room temperature.”



“I swear, they keep cutting costs more and more here,” said the receptionist. I shuffled back out the door. I could barely bring myself to go back in the car and drive home, but what choice did I have? Figgy was back at the apartment.



We got home, and there were the two Figs, sitting side by side in the living room, both with a black spiral of spots on their white fur. Sam approached behind me, put one of his freezing hands on my shoulder. I shivered. “It’s not too late,” he said softly beneath his bandages, “I think there’s an emergency vet in the next town over. We can make things right.” 



“Go to bed,” I said to Sam, forcing myself to turn around and kiss an uninjured spot on his forehead, “You need rest. I’ll be there soon.” Sam grunted, turned, and limped off. And I was left, looking at two Figs who stared right back at me.



That was three hours ago. I’m here in the living room now, on the couch. One Fig sleeps in her favorite chair, curled in a ball. And another Fig sits beside me, on the arm of the sofa, completely alert and staring at me, her face an inch away from mine. She hasn’t moved since I sat down. 



I’m scared to do it. I must be losing my mind. Only a crazy person would turn to their cat, tiny and soft with her pretty fur, and consider saying aloud what I want to ask. Because if what happens, what I think will happen, I will break entirely. So what will happen when I whisper, so gossamer soft that only the cat on my couch can hear, “Sam?” Will I have to quietly beg this second cat not to attack anymore, even if he really wants to, to stay safe? To keep all three of us alive, myself and the two Figs?



I think Fig is in my living room. I think she is on her chair. In fact, I know she is. I think Sam is in my apartment, too, but I don’t think he’s in my bedroom. 



So who, or what, is the thing that sleeps in my bed? The thing with the cold, torn, bandaged flesh? And what does he want with me?



What happens when I see him again? ",1,1763235590.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1oy0sai,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1oy0sai/ten_profitsharing_cooperatives_that_are_restoring/,Ten Profit-Sharing Cooperatives That Are Restoring the Planet,"Around the world, communities are proving that restoring the planet isn’t just the work of governments or big corporations. Cooperatives are quietly becoming some of the most powerful engines of environmental renewal. These member-owned, profit-sharing organizations link economic resilience with ecological restoration, giving ordinary people a direct stake in rebuilding forests, cleaning up waterways, restoring soil, and generating renewable energy. 


Below are ten of the most inspiring examples:

 1. [Middelgrunden Wind Cooperative in Denmark](https://www.middelgrunden.dk/middelgrunden-wind-farm/)

Middelgrunden is one of the world’s most iconic renewable-energy cooperatives, located just off the coast of Copenhagen. Half the offshore wind farm is owned by local citizens through a cooperative model, and the other half by the municipal utility. This structure allows community members to invest directly in clean energy and receive dividends from power generation. Denmark’s wider system of locally owned renewable-energy co-ops has helped make the country a global renewable-energy leader while grounding the benefits in local communities.

2. [Watershed Nursery Cooperative in California, USA](https://www.watershednursery.com/about-us/)

The Watershed Nursery is a worker-owned cooperative specializing in native plant propagation for ecological restoration projects. Worker-owners share profits, participate in governance, and restore habitat through their day-to-day work. Their nursery supplies plants for wetland, creek, and habitat restoration throughout the Bay Area.

3. [Green Worker Cooperatives in South Bronx, New York, USA](https://www.greenworker.coop/faq)

Green Worker Cooperatives is an environmental justice-focused cooperative incubator that helps create worker-owned green businesses in one of the most historically polluted neighborhoods in the U.S. Their co-ops include recycling, reuse, and materials-recovery businesses that divert waste from landfills and return profits to workers.

4. [Ethical Forestry Cooperatives in Nepal](https://fecofun.org.np/)

Nepal’s Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) are one of the world’s most successful large-scale examples of community-owned and profit-sharing forest restoration. Over 22,000 cooperatives collectively manage more than a third of the country’s forests, restoring degraded hillsides and protecting biodiversity while sharing revenue from sustainable timber, non-timber forest products, and ecotourism.

5. [Regenerative Agriculture Cooperatives](https://ecolonomics.org/how-community-and-cooperative-models-are-driving-regenerative-agriculture-forward/)

Around the world, agricultural cooperatives are shifting toward regenerative farming, where members share profits as well as ecological outcomes like improved soil health, reduced pesticide use, and increased biodiversity. Studies show cooperative farmers adopt sustainability practices at higher rates because profits remain in the community and long-term land health matters directly to member-owners.

Study: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10585324

Overview: https://regeneration.org/nexus/cooperatives

6. [Som Energia in Spain](https://www.somenergia.coop/es/)

Som Energia is a fast-growing renewable-energy cooperative with over 85,000 members who invest in and co-own solar, biogas, and wind projects. Members receive dividends and discounted green electricity, and the cooperative reinvests profits into new renewable projects. It’s become a major citizen-led force accelerating Spain’s clean-energy transition while keeping financial benefits within communities.

7. [Enercoop in France](https://www.faq.enercoop.fr/hc/fr)

Enercoop is France’s largest 100% renewable energy cooperative, owned by consumers, workers, and renewable-energy producers. Profits are reinvested into community solar, small hydro, and wind projects, while members receive transparent pricing and democratic governance. Enercoop has become a model for how citizens can directly accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels.

8. [La Cooperativa Integral Catalana, Spain](https://cooperativa.cat/welcome-to-cooperativa-integral-catalana-2/)

CIC is a bold, hybrid cooperative integrating ecological farming, renewable energy, local currencies, housing, and education. Many of its projects focus on soil regeneration, seed sovereignty, and circular-economy systems. Members co-produce food sustainably and share profits while rebuilding local ecological resilience.

9. [Cooperative Coffees in North & South America](https://coopcoffees.com/about-us#aboutus_coopcoffees)

Cooperative Coffees is a green, regenerative import cooperative supporting small-scale farmer co-ops throughout Latin America. It focuses on organic production, regenerative soil practices, biodiversity protection, and fair profit distribution.

10. Fishers’ Cooperatives Restoring Reefs & Mangroves in Indonesia, Philippines, and Kenya

Across Southeast Asia and East Africa, local fishers have formed cooperatives that restore mangroves, rebuild coral reefs, and manage fish stocks sustainably. Profits come from ecotourism, sustainable harvesting, and blue-carbon credits.

My skin was raw and in pain and it itched so badly that I felt like I was on fire. 

I went to an ER this past Tuesday hoping for help and a doctor (a male doctor ofc) told me to take a Benadryl and go home when he saw my skin. I thought mentioning I was pregnant would command a little more urgency, but I watched this man’s whole body language change. He relaxed, slumped into his chair, whipped out his phone and said “oh let’s look at pregnancy rashes”. He said I probably just had one of those and sent me home.

By the next day my pain was so severe I was struggling to function. I picked up some coffee with my husband before heading to a baby appointment to confirm whether what I had was PUPPPs or not. The sunlight coming through the coffee shop window hit my back and it was so painful I started shivering and my teeth started chattering. I couldn’t stop shaking until we made it to the OB’s office.

The doctors at my OB office took one look at me and told me I needed to be admitted to the hospital IMMEDIATELY. Doctors typically try to keep it together, they don’t want to scare you. But everyone made really horrified faces and kept apologizing just for touching me. My rash was so severe in certain places that my skin was purple.

Once admitted, the working theory was that I had early Steven Johnson’s syndrome (do not Google this if you have a weak stomach) because that’s exactly what my rash looked like and because I had only just recently even been diagnosed with lupus, my doctors worried my new lupus meds caused it.

After figuring out that steroids treated my itching and intense pain and that I wasn’t getting the other SJS symptoms (fever, sores in mucus membranes, etc) and further testing my doctors now think my recently diagnosed cutaneous lupus suddenly escalated to systemic lupus.

They also said they looked at references and cases where systemic lupus patients had a nearly identical rash to SJS patients. They looked just like me.

So while I’m not happy about my lupus suddenly evolving, I am celebrating it because, 1) I have an answer now (not officially diagnosed but it’s what everyone is agreeing on rn), and 2) it isn’t something as terrifying as SJS, there are fairly common and well known treatment plans for this. Baby is also safe and extremely active. Not one bit of this is bothering or hurting him and that’s all I could ask for.

Thank you everyone that reached out and left words of encouragement or support or even advice. That was so lovely to feel like somebody cared. And a giant “fuck you” to the ER doc that decided I was just a hysterical pregnant woman that needs Benadryl.",5,1763235322.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False

Editor's Note: It's me again. Sorry that this part got too long than I thought it should. Was hoping it would be shorter, but it was hard getting things straight than where I left off. The past few weeks for me has been getting foggy for me lately, so i hope that this turned out fine for y'all.

\*\*\*

I was waiting patiently as I held onto the business card. I’ve followed every word on the address to make sure I was getting it right, and so far it all seems right. I took a day off of work just to get here. My anxiety grew with each minute as I looked at the bus wondering what would happen next. It was a dreary day outside where the clouds had engulfed the sky. Only a hazy soft blue and gray of the day.



Just when I was about to leave, she finally came out of the bus to greet me. I smiled to see her.



“Hi Damian, I’m so happy you came! Come inside!” She motioned to the doorway as I went in.



While it was no big red bus, it definitely looked better inside than out. A bitsized blood test room to fit the already large bus. On my left side were the typical cabinets, sink, first aid, and canisters for biological waste along with a trash can. By the back of the bus were the various biological symbols that I have no clue about, aside from the other medical materials of needles, tubes, and canisters for blood bags. On my right was the chair for where the patient would sit although for some reason, there were restraint straps on the chair.



I made a face at it and turned to Maddy. “What’s with the restraints? I thought we’re just taking blood?”



“We are,” she said with her calm gothic demeanor. “Although sometimes they’ll be jumpy and might swipe you to stop. I doubt you’d need it for our patients, but they are there just in case if, well–”



“Okay, I get it, I guess.” I had to agree that it could be a precaution. I just don’t know if that was what would be allowed in any other bus. The more I was overwhelmed by that and the other medical information surrounding me, the more it made me wonder if it was a good idea getting this role.



“Are you sure I would be the right pick?” I asked, feeling a little uncomfortable.



“Oh don’t worry, it’s not really that hard. Look, I’ll show you. Here, take a seat,” She commanded as she motioned to the patient’s chair. I did as she asked, unquestioning. I never knew she had that much of a presence. She sat in the doctor’s chair as she said smoothly “Now watch what I do.”



She prepared the needle with a tube attached, placed the rubber ribbon around my arm to pop the veins more, applied the alcohol patch over my vein, and finally injected the needle in. She looked up to me momentarily as our eyes met. Her ocean eyes, all encompassing.



“Oh, uh, are you afraid of needles?” she said that was more of a whisper. Her crashing waves inundating my skin with goosebumps. I shook my head no. I was afraid of needles like every kid when they were little, which got hard to believe when we get older. Whenever I’d do one, I can just watch the whole thing as they take my blood. I guess that made me uncanny to an extent. Maybe it was what she saw in me?



“Oh no, I’m fine with it.” I said. She smiled as she inserted it in. I felt the pinch and winched before I laxed. I watched the whole thing before turning to her, her haunting beauty. She didn’t look back this time, as her interest was in the blood. She took one capsule of my blood as the demonstration was over. She placed a cloth and band for my arm and threw out the needle to the biological waste bin.



“So that’s pretty much what you have to do.” She said, “Just had to plug the tube into the blood bag instead of this capsule. Do you have any questions? You think you got what it takes?”



“I mean, sure but doesn’t this seem,” I motioned a bit on my seat. “I don’t know, out of my field?”



“Oh no I get it but don’t worry, again, the whole thing is pretty easy. That’s why I want *you* to do this. I work more in the administrative part of this stuff. But my dad had to make me do all this before we started hiring.” First time she mentioned her dad and the business size.



“I thought you work at the day–”



“Yeah, it’s mostly for administrative stuff. I forgot to mention that during the party.” She tucked her hair back behind her ear.



“Okay. … So do I have to sign anything or just,”



“Oh don’t worry, you got the job,” She said quickly before face palming. “Oh, shit I forgot! I just have to ask you some medical questions. Sorry.” I chuckled and told her that it was alright. I thought it was weird, her being fidgety sometimes. I guessed that she was nervous about handling her boyfriend taking her family’s job. Nepotism much, I guess.



“Okay? Shoot.” I said as she began the laundry list of medical questions. Taking any drugs, alcohol consumption, all the usual things. There was one question she asked that I thought was weird. Something around the lines of “are you okay with working night shift only?” I said yes automatically but the question clung on. Was the shift only at night? All night? At the time, I didn’t care, I got the job and a girlfriend which were the only things that concerned me then.



“So that about sums it up. Do you have anything for me?” she said and as she did, she crossed her ivory legs. I had to focus on her face for that question.



“Y-yeah, right. So, don't the blood donors give the patient a blanket?” I asked innocently. I remembered my high school did a blood donation and they said that they gave him a blanket afterwards. Said that it helps the body warm up.



“It’s not necessary, Damian. The patient will be fine.” she said from her black lips. 



Not necessary?, I thought. “Are you sure, cuz I had this friend–”



“Look, darling. I worked on this for a long time, and so far I notice that they’ll just warm up after,” there was an awkward pause before she continued. “So,” she said, her stance frigid, hands in place on her lap. “Is there anything else you want to ask of me?” She leaned a bit when she said that. I felt my cheeks flare and my blood rushing. There was a lot I wanted to say. To do. But after some careful breaths, I went with a small token.  


“Uh, I was … wondering if you’d like to go to the mall sometime?” I shot out. “There’s a lot to do there! Especially at night when it lights up. What do you think?”



She just stared at me, as if contemplating something before she placed a hand underneath her chain and replied, “I’d love to, darling. Let’s see how you do on the first shift tonight.”



\*\*\*



At first, I didn’t expect anyone to show up. I spent the whole day waiting around, spinning around the room of the bus. I read and reread the instructions she left about that orientation day, but I didn’t expect it to be this boring. It was whatever since I was getting the money for just being here. If I had still worked at the grocery store, my manager would be bitching to me about staying busy.



It was maybe around 12 am when I heard a knock. It kind of spooked me, but I managed to get up to answer the door. The first patient was hard to see in the dead of night. When I asked him to come inside, that was when I got a good look at him under the bus’ light. He had this derpy smile on his face and seemed to be in a stupor over his glazed eyes. I couldn’t tell if he was drunk or drugged. If it wasn’t any of these things, then that's one weird way to show up to this.



I got my clipboard and pen ready, “Okay, uhh, are you under the influence of drugs or alcohol?”



“No.” he said, plainly.



“Okay,” I said and wrote down his response. Gotta look professional, you know. “Blood type?”



“A Negative.” he said. 



I wrote that too and motioned him to the chair. “Okay. Have a seat, Mr.” I drawled it out to coax anything from him. Nothing. He just went past me and just sat.



I retraced the steps that Maddy showed me and wrapped the straps around his arm and legs. I glanced at him to see he didn’t seem fazed by it at all. Not even a question. Something about it felt weird, and invasive. People usually get apprehensive or try to hide their anxiety with the pinch or not at all but not like this. Regardless, I had to do the procedure as Maddy showed me. Either this guy was really drunk or just some sicko.



I’ll admit, I had some trouble figuring out the right vein, but eventually I found it and did the whole extraction. It felt strange to be the one administering these injections rather than the one getting it. He didn’t wince when I inserted it; he didn’t even look at the needle nor looked away; Just stared out into space. When I tried to converse with him, he did nothing. I tried to get him to say his name, it did nothing. I used my free hand to snap my fingers at his face, but didn't respond at all. *What the fuck*, I thought, beginning to see why Maddy would recommend the straps. The last thing I needed to see was him lunging at me or shaking profusely from whatever trance they’re in.



As the blood bag inflated slowly, my eyes went to examine him. He was a good looking man with a curtain cut of black hair. From his sweatshirt and pants, I guessed he had a late night stroll before heading over here. Is that why he was so dazed? If so, why show up before a make-shift red bus? I didn’t know. Didn’t want to know. His color drained as the blood bag almost filled up, looking more like Madline by the minute. I thought it was weird, but I kept going anyway. As messed up as it sounded, this guy is my first quarter of my paycheck, so I had to do my job. I can’t let her down.



After gathering enough blood, I covered his insertion with medical cloth and tape as I drew out the needle. He still had that aloof look on him even after he looked pale and drained. I told him he can leave now after unstrapping his arms and legs and he just walked out of the bus and into the deep night. After he left, my head let out some deep sigh of relief. Everything seemed to have gone alright, but it was the weirdest thing I’ve seen. Something told me that it wouldn’t be the last. After a few minutes of rest, I unplugged the blood bag, labeled it, and placed it in the fridge. Preparing the next bag for the next patient that knocks.



An hour would go by as the next one came and the one after that. With each patient, I noticed how each patient looked just as unkempt, dirty, and estranged as the last. Each one doing what the first guy did. Each one filling the fridge. Each one, a large stash of cash into my bank account. Despite the first guy, they all shared similar traits but differentiated sometimes. One would look like they were in ecstasy when I inserted the needle, another would mutter something under their breath, and another would just be agape throughout the withdrawal. It started to become a bit more uncomfortable, invasive even. The best I could do was just not focus on them, and I would be fine. Even for a little while.



It was after the 10th patient left did I get a call from Maddy, telling me that my shift was done and said it’s good to go home. I thanked her, hung up and stretched my back a bit. I went over to the sink to wash my hands and face before heading back home, leaving the weirdness and strangeness of this new job behind me for the night.



Days would go by, and I slowly became a nocturnal animal after each “blood shift” as I called it. I had to change my hours with the grocery store just to fit them in. More money for the debt payments to ease my parent’s suffering. Each time the shift was over, she’d call me saying the time is up but sometimes it would be infrequent. Sometimes, it would end after the 5th guy and a night later it was 16 people. I grew annoyed from it, but I didn’t feel that way for too long. The following day was the date me and Madeline planned on, the night at the mall. I was so excited, I ran home when my shift was over. My first date.



\*\*\*



The excitement transferred over to the grocery work at the day. Despite the exhaustion, with Victor and now Madeline in my life, I felt ever so chipper. I was about half an hour to closing my shift when a customer came in for checkout. I was about to greet him merrily until my face dropped from the recognition. Standing before me, setting down beets, berries, and fish, was the first patient.



He looked terrible, as if he just woke up with pneumonia. His face was pale under the yellowish light with bags under the eyes making it as if he struggled to sleep. He wore the same shirt but completely unkempt and drenched in sweat. He was sweating so profusely that his hair was greasy. My back felt tense and my feet felt cold and numb. I doubted he had anything that warmed him that night.



I swallowed my fears and proceeded to start scanning the groceries. As I did, I took my customer's courtesy and asked him, “Good afternoon, sir. How are you today?”



He groaned from his pain, some drool coming from his parched lips as he croaked, “Complete shit. I’m not sure why though, but it's been days feeling this way. I checked my blood pressure only to find out that it was too low. Maybe that’s why I'n so sick these past few days."" He said as he let out another groan. I got a little sick to my stomach too. This doesn’t feel right. Wouldn’t he have known about his appointment? Does he remember at all?



I had to probe. “Uhh, haven’t I seen you before?”



He looked at me with confusion. His damp face twisting to a wince. “What? Oh uh yeah I go to this store every now and then but–”



“No, like,” I tried to think of some lie to say. I tried to hide myself from it when I said, “I saw you at the blood test lab downtown.”



He looked even more confused. “What the fuck are you talking about? I haven't taken any blood test lately,” he said as I bagged the groceries. That’s when I remembered the mark on his arm.



“But what about that dot on your arm? Haven’t you–” I said but he jerked it away and held on to it with his other hand to cover.



He took the groceries and paid before saying, “Mind your own business, asshole.”



I clocked out and headed home. While on the drive, I couldn’t help but think about what that guy said. I mean, he saw the whole thing, didn’t he? He wasn’t drunk so what was it? I didn’t think it was hypnosis either. Sure he looked dazed, but I doubt that shit even works on real people than it does in fiction. Thinking about it made me realize another thing. Since that first guy came, all the others had similar looks to them, sometimes looking more uncanny than the other. Were they feeling just as unwell as he was? My shins felt cold from that notion. I better talk with Madline when we get to the mall.



\*\*\*



I waited for her as I got to the mall entryway earlier. I tried my best with getting her on board with this but only for the weekend night. It was what she agreed to since it was a weekend don’t do my blood shifts then. I was messaging her to know if she was here or almost here. Right when I was about to, she tapped my shoulder.



“Hey, you look great!” I complemented her despite looking as casual as when she was at that house party. I took her hand, cold as it was, and we ventured into the mall. Riddled with sounds of people going about and music playing softly in the background. I leaned over to her ear.



“Have you been to this mall before?” I asked her.



She leaned over to me to do the same with her pouty lips. “I don’t think so. I don’t go out often since I work a lot anyway, you know?” yeah I guess I did know. It made me think of the patients again.



“So, when you did these, uhh, blood shifts, have you ever–”



She looked at me funny. “Blood shifts?”



“Y-yeah, I’ve been calling them that after a while. I thought it would distinguish the job.” I said, a bit embarrassed. She just shook her head and smiled, a smile made from hearing a bad joke. I couldn’t help but smile too.



“Sure. Welcome to the Blood Shift, my darling.” She said, her shoulders poking mine from time to time as we walked. I held her chilled hand from there and swung it gently like a see-saw. I forgot then what I even asked of her. We kept walking around until I led her to the first stop: The Hot Topic.



“Alright! Let’s check out some clothes that’s–” That was when I felt her touch slip from mine. I looked at her confused. She didn’t move at all when she saw the store sign.



“Hey come on,” I said. “Don’t gothic girls like Hot Topic?”



That was when I noticed her face more. She seemed more apprehensive as if a dog at the vet. I tapped her shoulder to get her off the shock to which she looked at me when I asked about it. She slowly gave out a nervous smile back. “Oh yeah I get that it’s just,” she reached for my hand again, leaned very close to my ear as she whispered to me over her veil of hair, “I-I don’t like mirrors.”



It took me a while to set in. I didn’t understand, at first, but the best I could do was to nod and proceed to show her something else. We went through other places. A candy store, gaming stores, a Starbucks. All the while wondering about her apparent phobia with mirrors. It was when we got to the food court that I started talking to her about it.



“Oh um, I have anorexia. It just makes me feel nervous whenever I see mirrors because, well, I don’t like seeing myself in them, you know?” She said as she took a bite off her burger. I found it strange. I didn’t think she was too thin nor too fat either; she looked just fine to me, no matter how she saw herself.



“You sure that’s what anorexia is? Isn’t that an eating disorder too?” I asked.



She gulped and gulped again as if she choked on something. “Oh yeah I’ve been working with my therapist on that. It’s been 30 days, and I’ve made a lot of progress.” She said, regaining composure.



“Oh,” I said, feeling a little shitty asking her that despite how normal it was. Thinking back on it, I should have asked more about her anorexia, but I wanted to ask her about something else. The first patient flashed in my mind. 



“Yeah, so I met my first patient again,” I chirped. I looked up to see her stop chewing and just stared at me. It made me want to find the next words correctly. “He didn’t look very good, almost as if sick days after his visit. I don’t know, have you ever seen patients appear, I don’t know, weird?”



She swallowed her bite before replying, “yes, I forgot to mention that the patients would be a bit odd when they arrive. That's all.”



“Yeah but,” I thought of the first patient again. “He really didn’t look too good. I know you said the blankets aren’t necessary but are you sure that–”



“Oh, he’s just getting attention is all.” she said sharply.



The sudden reply took me back. “He didn’t remember it at all. Don’t you think that's weird?”



“It was late, Damian. He probably just forgot since it was at night. Okay?” She said, although her voice was strained, as if annoyed by these questions. I wondered if I was ruining it for us. It was our first date after all, and I didn’t want to spoil it. 



Maybe she’s right. Maybe the guy just didn’t remember.



After we ate, I showed her the best for last. Situated at the center of the mall was the water fountain. I found a bench next to some interior plants. We watched the water skipping around the pool making traced motions and shapes that sparkled under the mall lights. It was beautiful to watch. I looked over to her, and she just looked. Was she impressed? I couldn’t tell from her blank expression.



“Uh, hey you got a coin?” I chirped to her. She turned to me to shake her head.



“I didn’t know they had a water fountain. Guess it was on me then.” she gave a short laugh after.



It’s a good thing I brought two then. “Don’t worry I got some quarters.” I said as I tried to take them out. Despite the struggle, I plucked them out.



“What’s wrong?” She said, a lil worried from my reaction.



“Oh it’s nothing. Ow, fuck! I just–” I took a look and was surprised. The tip of my finger was releasing a small dot of blood coming out, almost like a water balloon. Forgot to take out my workname pin. FUCK. I looked at Maddy to show her I was alright. Although, I took a pause when I noticed her expression. Her eyes widened as she stared at my finger which was the most emotive she had been since the Hot Topic. It was different, more afire than frightened.



“Oh no, it’s okay. It’s just some blood is all. Look let me just–” I tried to suck my own thumb when her hands slowly wrapped around my arm, drawing her closer. “Here, let me” she said softly as she took it in, sucking my bleeding finger in her mouth. Twisting her tongue around it as well as feeling her teeth against the soft skin of my wounded finger. Her expression changed, savouring it almost. I just gave her a weird look from it all, trying to suppress my … arousal? I thought I wasn’t into this; guessing that she was kinda freakier than I imagined.



Eventually she let go, her face softened and huffing from the supposed ecstacy. I just stared at her, weirded out while feeling heated. Was she turned on? It was when I examined my finger that I looked shocked. The cut is completely gone, as if it never bled. I just stared at it for so long that I forgot my words before they came back to me.

I went back to look at her. “How did you do that?” I said, bewildered.

“I’m not sure,”  she said, her eyes ablaze with some ounce of red passion as she blushed. “It’s what my father taught me.” She said before she took my collar to lean me in for a kiss. Out of nowhere. My brain flashed endless fireworks. Stimulation overtook me as I kissed her back. Her face was flushed and blushy. Under the moonlight and sprinkling water, that was our first kiss.



I pulled back to get some air, and some answers. “Okay, but how did you do that? And what was up with you–”



She cut me off to whisper. “Damian. It’s what I'm good at.” and drove back to kiss me again.



I couldn’t remember the rest of the night after.



\*\*\*



I remembered the next day it was raining cats and dogs outside in the damp gray evening when another patient knocked nonchalantly. This guy did not look like some ordinary person. He looked like a homeless man you’d see by the alleyway. Judging from his wrinkles and beard hair, he looked no older than my overworked dad. His dazed face and glazed eyes just made me more uncomfortable with the job again. I just did the usual, motioned him to the seat and strapped him in. Picked out the needle and did the other things like any other.



As I did, my mind was thinking about that night. It was the first kiss I ever got from Madeline. The sweet taste of her lips and her bite. I won’t go any further but I cannot keep her off my mind now. I looked over at the patient again, dazed and mouth agaped. I figured that I’d take a nap. I mean, if I was going to work late at night, I might as well slip in one. The blood bag takes a long time for it to fill anyway.



As my mind drifted to sleep, I could see the slow projection of my visions come into view. I remembered standing by a beach of some kind. The vision was so hazy that I couldn't make out anything beyond my hand. The cold breeze of the ocean in its misty quintessence and the moonlight white illuminating the sandy ground and sea beyond. Further out, I saw a figure from afar walking across the sand as if he was in some kind of spell. Walking towards a clawed hand as if beckoning to him, accompanied with the two pale dots. The rest of the person was shrouded in a silhouette as if behind some curtain. I remembered running towards the figure in some weird attempt to get to save them. I didn’t feel the sand on my feet nor the misty wind in the air. I ran and shouted despite nothing coming out, the pale eyes and the figure looked right at me so suddenly. The figure tried to jerk away from the horror enticing him as I saw the vague monster lunge at me. It was then that I awoke.



Awoken in a cold sweat to the horror of the patient gasping and screaming. His dazed look was completely gone, replaced with eyes darting around and at me. He looked at the blood bag and then at me. I felt my heart drop to its stomach. He shaked around despite the straps screaming about wanting out. I didn't know what to do but to calm him.



“SIR, SIR PLEASE CALM down, it's alright!” I said with my hands stretched to keep him steady on the seat. I never saw a man look this scared in my entire life, and I was on edge with whoever I let in.



He started to wheeze and sob from the horror, “Please, please don’t kill me! W-Why are you taking my blood?”



My eyes looked around for an answer. I didn’t know how to even answer that. “Sir, calm down, I’m not gonna kill you! I’m just gonna- ""I stopped before saying the rest. What? Take his blood? You really think that’ll calm him down? He was acting like everyone else up until now! I had to think about something else as some kind of alibi. As he started to stop shaking around and whimpering, I thought of one. “I’m just taking an exam on your wellness.”



He sniffed back his mucus before steading himself at his seat, his focus on the needle. “Uhh, uh, h-h-how did I get here? I don’t, I don’t–”



“You... didn’t set up an appointment or something?” This confirmed my suspicions with the first patient. Hell, I doubt this guy knew anything about his blood type.



“What appointment? I don’t even remember how I got here,” He said as he looked at me. “Can you please take this fucking things off me,” It was just like meeting the first guy at that store again. Only now it filled me with dread with him seeing me. In this place. I didn’t know what else to do as he grew impatient from my hesitations. “What the hell kind of wells check is this!?” I knew that I couldn’t. Otherwise, he would assault me or run to the police. My mind raced for something to do. Anything. The room felt hot and claustrophobic as my mind and anxiety ramped up to eleven. I searched for something to say.



Then again, this was my only chance. “Okay, I need to ask. What was the last thing you remember? Do you recall anything before you got here? If you can do that for me, I’ll let you out of those straps, okay?” He nodded with agreement. This was my only chance to get something out. I wiped his eyes and blew his nose before waiting for his answer.



It took him a while though, “I was just sitting around by the street. I heard someone walking towards me. \[wheeze\]. It was so dark, I couldn’t have seen them but,” he looked over at me. His lost hazel green staring back. “They, they had them glowden eyes! Like two pale moons, I saw them! I felt as if I was a dreamin’. I saw a moon with stars crashing against the waves of some beach. I wuz followin’ someone as I did but I heard shouting and a man from far behind, and I wuz here.” He moved his arms against the straps. “Please mister, let me go, "" You promised that you’ll let me go! I answered what ya asked. I promise I won’t tell anyone! I swear! I’m sorry! Please! PLEASE!!”



I was frozen there now. I wasn’t sure what would’ve happened if I would. Oh God, Madline was gonna kill me. Why a homeless person? “Hold on sir, I’ll get someone to help.” I got up to find my phone before heading out of the bus. Trying to tune out his desperate pleas to be let out. I did the only thing I could do and called Maddy about the whole situation.



“I see,” she said coldly. “I’ll be over.” And just like that she hung up.



She came an hour later. “Stay outside, I’ll handle this but stay out here!” she told me. While I was concerned, I did as she told me and waited out in the damp outdoors. The rain stopped but the smell of it was still here. I was left pacing back and forth about what would happen to him. I’m not sure what will happen now. Is she going to break out with me? Tell me not to do that again? The door opened and he got out first, walked past me and into the night without acknowledging me. Next came Maddy who looked at me with some kind of contempt on her face.



“I-I’m sorry that I messed up–” I started before she held up a hand. Her face had a cold, restrained anger behind it. Her eyes crashed like the waves that once alluded me. I grew very afraid of what she might do.



“I *never* want to hear you fucking say that, EVER!” she hissed. “Do you understand that!” She repeated but louder. I wanted to slip out and run, but my legs betrayed me. She quivered from the sheer emotion of her anger towards me. It was as if I failed her that night.  
  
All I could do was whimper and squirm out, “I-I understand. P-p-please just–” and she let go. I rubbed my face when I was broken free, looked at her with more fear than ever.



She pinched her nose as her anger passed. “Whatever, ” she said sharply. “I do NOT want you sleeping on the job!” 

“I’m sorry, it won’t happen again,” I said. That was when I realized something she said. “ Wait, how did you know—“

Whatever, Damian! What else would have caused the guy to wake up after extracting too much!” she said, making exaggerated motions. I was just there feeling helpless and ashamed. She saw the shame on my face and started to caress my face. “I just don’t want you messing this up, baby. I know that we all make mistakes but for this job, I *really* don’t want you to make any. Can you do that for me?” The shift of her tone left me mildly comforted, but I could only suspect it was just to save face. I nodded and told her it won’t happen again. The blood shift ended that night.

At home, I just felt sour ending it on that bad note, but I felt I deserved it for sleeping on the job. Then again, I knew something was very wrong here. I remembered what the man said. *Glowing or pale eyes peering into the night, an ocean with stars and a moon, dream-like*. It was those crumbs of words that those other patients were saying. Does Madline even know or was this something else entirely? I mean, sure she can assume that I was napping but how did she *know*? As if she saw me doing so? The more I thought about it, the more I wondered where that money really came from.



The next morning, Victor didn’t have work. I called him about what’s been happening lately with the patients and that dream with the homeless one. He got a bit silent from what I was describing.



“There is something I gotta talk to you about.” He said sternly.



“What do you mean?” I asked. That was when he described yesterday. He was taking the groceries out for this one guy to which he bantered during the transaction. He mentioned me working for Maddy’s donorship bus to which the guy got cold.



“He said that he has also been working with Madline recently. From what he described, it reminded me of you. I mentioned about you, and now he says he wants to meet you. Are you interested?” he said. I did remember Maddy saying that she’s hiring. Maybe I can get something from him.



“Alright.”I said as we said our goodbyes and hung up. I stared up at the ceiling of my room with the things that Victor just told me about. I could just quit, put it all behind me but to go back to doing just the grocery store? And what about this person just now?



There was only one way to find out.



\*\*\*



We waited for a while now. Me and Victor got us a table for this guy as we waited for about 30 minutes for this guy to arrive which made my butt hurt from the metal seat. My feet were kicking like a drum player to an invisible bass drum.



“So when is this guy gonna come?” I asked, feeling impatient from the wait. My coffee, already cold.



“I’m not sure. He said he’s a bit far from the city so it may take a while for him to arrive. Oh look there he is!” he pointed and waved to him. He looked tall but his face was a bit gaudy. Had a beanie on top and a misfit shirt on to match. We shook hands and took a table over to greet him. 



He sat nonchalantly as he took a sip of his drink. “E yeah, whatever was happening, she’s got some shit going on I didn’t yet see,” He said to me. Darted his eyes on the both of us before looking around. “I graduated in the hopes to be a doctor but with the student debt and the job market going tits up, I had to find something to at least get something going. It was then that I met Madeline by a bus stop, and she offered me the job–”



“Wait, I thought she worked that day.”I blurted out.



He just shrugged and said, “I mean, I guess it was a weekend or something, but it was a long time ago, so I don’t know. Although I couldn’t tell who she was from her jacket and pants covering her up entirely. I assumed it was Porphyria or something like that. Maybe –” 



“The hell is Porphyria?” Victor said.



“Oh yeah, it’s this rare disease that causes skin irritation under the sun. Burning of the skin kind of sensitivity, you know? Where was I– Oh yeah!” He said as he went on about his start for his blood shifts. I never knew Maddy had something that rare. Not only that, but it must be really sad to have to avoid the day while feeling guilty with how she sees herself in mirrors, if she even sees anything at all at this point.



Anyway, the guy began mentioning how he noticed the same stuff that I’ve dealt with: The aloofness, the daze in the eye and just the uncanny mutterings as if they were in deep sleep. I felt somewhat relieved with how I wasn’t the only one that was having this experience, but he added something in his testimony.



“There was this one patient that showed signs of R.E.M sleep! I had to examine this discovery and so I went over to check on them. I’ve studied as much as I did about how the human body works, but I’ve never seen anything like this. The eyes were dilating! The patient was overwhelmed in their cognition, whatever their dream was. Not only that, they were contracting too!”



“What gives?” I asked.



“The thing is that contractions in the eyes couldn’t be done under light exposure. Usually under sleep, they wouldn’t respond to such things but this patient did,” He rambled as he took a sip to his coffee again. Scratching his neck as if a mosquito bit it all throughout. I couldn’t tell if he was making this shit up, or if he really saw this.



He kept on rambling, “I was as spooked as you were when the patient showed distress, and like you, I managed to calm them down. After they came to, I was able to ask the patient about what drove them there. They mention those same descriptions of those two, pale moon eyes staring back and the beckoning hand. Eyes like sapphire jewels. It reminded me of those eyes nocturnal animals got, helping them see more in the dark.



Anyway, I just let the patient go. I called Madeline about the patient not being a good candidate for blood donorship. Made up a story about their critical condition or something. She sounded frustrated but bought my refusal. Days later, I found a nursing role for the city hospital. I took the opportunity to tell her about my resignation” he chuckled at that, scratching more of his mosquito bitten neck. I wondered just how many times he applied only to get just one offer. “But I don’t know. All of this makes me wonder if I was in some sort of trafficking ring or some shit. Even then, it was strange how fine she was with the resignation than with how queer the patients were acting. If she had her way, she wouldn’t want anyone to leave, wouldn't she?” he looked at me as if waiting for a response.  
  
I didn’t know what to say other than, “I don’t think so.”



“Hmph. Well I hope to hell it isn’t,” he looked over at me. “But either way, I don’t trust her after all that shit. There’s something wrong about this, and I don’t want to stick around to find out. I suggest that you do the same.” He said before getting up to shake our hands again. “Thanks for the coffee, and I wish you guys the best.” And with that he turned and left, leaving me and Victor to take it all in.



“You know that thing he said with the eyeshine reminded me of something.” Victor said, twisting his crucifix around and around..



“What do you mean? I said.



“Do you know what Skinwalkers are?” he inquired.



I let out a scoff, “Come on man,” I said. “That's stupid!”



“Then what else could explain those sleep-walking patients? I know it’s stupid, but what could be leading these patients to the buses?”



“Well then, do you think–” I stammered before he cutted in.



“I don’t know. Maybe the skinwalker is coercing her to operate this whole thing? After all, they can get into one’s head as well as transforming. ” he said, although a bit uncertain.   
  
I wasn’t sure what I could even do if that was the case. I can rely a lot from Victor’s insight but there are times where I don’t think he can help out. He went to get his crucifix around his neck and gave them to me. “Look, I don’t know how religious you are, but if anything, maybe it’ll help you find peace in all of this. Just give it a try, man.” He said as I took his offer. I thanked him for it but I'm not sure. I’m not all that religious but who knows, maybe it would find me peace. As I walked to my car, I thought I saw something a few blocks down. Someone darting out before I could make out anything. The skinwalker, maybe.



When I got back home, I went back to staring blank around my room for a while trying to make sense of it. It could very well be some kind of operation but … really? I mean it does explain the salary, I guess, but what about those pale eyes? Victor must really be pulling my leg on that one implying that she’s working with some cryptid to lure people into a blood donorship bus. But then again, what else would make sense of all this. It got me to check out about the skinwalkers stuff online. Read the bio and what they can do seems to line up, I guess, but not quite.



It was there, amongst the list of others like it did I find one that I was enticed with. It almost spiraled into a rabbit hole of names like chubacabra and all the capabilities relating to blood-sucking cryptids and mythical monsters until I felt a buzz in my pocket as I reached down to my phone.



A message from Madline.



“I’d like for you to come over to my house. I’m giving you a promotion.”



I looked at the word confused if not unnerved with the words. A promotion? For drawing blood from people? Especially after messing up with that one homeless patient?



I messaged back, “What do you mean a promotion? Why?”



“I just want to give you something for all your hard work :-) ”



This made me grow more uneasy. The things I’ve learned from that med student, Victor’s implications, and my online sleuthing gave a chill up my spine. I had to make a response before she’d get any more ideas.



“Uh sure, I’d be over, when?” I said.

Its not the end of the world? I am 28F he is 34M,"We met last December (2024) and just connected so well, which is not very common considering how old school I am. After our first meeting, we chatted back and forth via text for a day or two, and then he went silent for 2 weeks. I was confused, but I didn't think too deeply. I low-key wished he had texted back again, which he did on New Year's! It made my day; he wanted to see me again. I thought about it and agreed to see him in a week, and kept talking over text until the night before the meeting. He sent me a voice note saying that he is not as serious as I am about marriage, but he really enjoys spending time with me. I replied, saying I am not looking for short-term or casual relationships and that it may not be a good idea to meet. He replied, saying he cancelled the breakfast reservation and may have to try it on his own :( I felt bad to begin with. I don't know what I loved about this guy, and then seeing his message in the evening saying he thought I'd make it for us, reading this melted my heart. Meanwhile, I had gotten a present for him when he reached out on New Year's, as it was also his birthday. He said that holding on to it would be a burden to me. It was a customized present with his name on it, and I told him that I wanted to pass it to him since I did not want to keep it in my home for my family to question me. He was appreciative and agreed to take it. A few days later, I texted him to see if he was free in the evening, and I could pass him the present. He sent me his address, we met that evening and seeing him felt like the world to me. We stayed in my car and talked for a bit. He said no one has ever done anything this sweet for him and kissed me on my forehead. Later apologized for this, but he was overwhelmed with gratitude, he said. He asked me if I wanna meet him again. I hesitantly replied, I want to say yes, he held my hands and pleaded 'Then say yes, and we decided to meet.

The next couple of meetings, we met for breakfast and lunch at a restaurant, after which he invited me to his apartment, as my car used to be parked in his parking. Things escalated physically, which I was not in line with, but I gave in to him. We did not kiss until a month later, when he was leaving for 2 months overseas to visit his family. He kissed me, and I somewhat resisted. But since it was him, a guy I admire so much, I let it happen. He left the next morning, and I was sobbing, thinking when and if we would meet again. We chatted until he boarded the plane, and he blocked me. No contact until April, which was a few weeks before he was returning. We started talking again, and he confessed he missed me. When he came back in May, he texted me he was back, and we decided to meet. I had taken the day off from work to meet him. He did not text me all day, the day of the meeting, until the afternoon, saying he was busy with work. I found that to be pathetic, and asked him out of obvious disappointment if he wanted to reschedule, and surprisingly, he sent a voice note if that was possible, but he could still meet if rescheduling was inconvenient. We ended up meeting at a cafe, and I got him flowers, which I had never done before for anyone. He asked me to come to his apartment, a lot of physical closeness (but no s\*x). We met again a few times more until July with the same patterns of communication and physical intimacy.

I finally confessed my discomfort with how things were going without a commitment after 9 months of talking and meeting 13 times. He listened to me and talked me through how he was not in the mental space for the long term, considering the instability of his work and uncertainty around relocating, perhaps. We still chatted about how wonderful we thought each of us was, and just ended the convo with my text being the last one to him. It's been 3 months of no contact, and I think about him every hour of the day. I have episodes of crying every other day. I've taken therapy, and the therapist says it's better I not reach out as I may not be on his mind as deeply or else he would have reached out already. I do not find peace in any of this, but what I also fear is if I reach out and he doesn't reply or plays cold or is with someone else, it would be a hit to my self-respect. But it's to the point that I check his last seen multiple times an hour, and it panics me if he's not online for an unusual duration or up for too long at night. I am in a very painful situation, and the urge to at least talk to him is at the tip of my fingers. I need to ask myself the right questions, or maybe I'm thinking too much, and it would not be the end of the world if I reach out.

Note: All these times we met, he initiated the plans except for the last one. I would always drive to him, which I did not mind, as he did offer to come to me a few times, but he would have had to commute twice as long, so I was happy to go to him.

I know this is long, but I'm happy to answer questions to figure this out.

UPDATE (NOV 2025): I was going through his messages and accidentally called and disconnected immediately as it was past midnight. He messaged with my name and a question mark. I saw this in the morning and replied, saying sorry about the call. Asked him how he was doing... he replied saying that he had to quit what he was doing and will be leaving the country and moving back home soon. I was happy that he replied to me but also moved by his plans about leaving. I asked if we can meet and he is down for it, clarifying that he isnt leading me on and would like to keep things light. We are meeting for coffee in two days. Im in love with the thought of seeing him, but it feels like a dead end as this would not lead anywhere. I feel empty inside...what can I do to convince him...I dont wanna be pushy but I wanna make this work",1,1763235249.0,u_Prestigious-Craft719,0,1.0,False

Burner account, attempt 2 because I tried posting this earlier and got some really mean comments calling my dad names. I deleted my account but then decided to repost . Please give me respectful, honest advice.

I (F, 20) was raised by my mom (F, 40) and her grandmother. My mom always me told that she was working for my dad (M, 59) at his coffee shop when she was 18. They fell in love, and when she got pregnant, her parents kicked her out. My dad let her move in with him.

My mom claims that my dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive, so she left to live with her grandmother before I was born. I had a nice childhood to be fair. I spent a lot of time with my grandmother because my mom was going to nursing school and working long hours. My mom took me on trips and activities, and she volunteered a lot at my school.

Recently, I found my dad, and it completely changed my perspective. I learned that my dad was going through a hard time when my mom got pregnant … he was struggling with depression, drinking a lot, and his coffee shop was failing. My mom realized that the “cash cow” was dying and left him, never trying to help him. Luckily, he met an amazing woman named Elaine (F, 57) who cared for him, helped him get sober, and stood by him. Dad and Elaine told me that my dad contacted my mom a few times, even offering money and asking to see me, but my mom decided not to tell me and ignored them. They eventually lost contact with her.

I talked to my mom, and she claims she was “protecting” me. She insists my dad was very physically abusive, but Elaine said he never abused her, even at his lowest point. I’m furious that my mom decided for me, because all these years I could have had a relationship with my dad and Elaine.

I have decided to go no contact with my mom and will spend holidays with my dad and Elaine. My boyfriend thinks this is an overreaction and that I should try to work things out with her.

Editor's Note: It's me again. Sorry that this part got too long than I thought it should. Was hoping it would be shorter, but it was hard getting things straight than where I left off. The past few weeks for me has been getting foggy for me lately, so i hope that this turned out fine for y'all.

\*\*\*

I was waiting patiently as I held onto the business card. I’ve followed every word on the address to make sure I was getting it right, and so far it all seems right. I took a day off of work just to get here. My anxiety grew with each minute as I looked at the bus wondering what would happen next. It was a dreary day outside where the clouds had engulfed the sky. Only a hazy soft blue and gray of the day.



Just when I was about to leave, she finally came out of the bus to greet me. I smiled to see her.



“Hi Damian, I’m so happy you came! Come inside!” She motioned to the doorway as I went in.



While it was no big red bus, it definitely looked better inside than out. A bitsized blood test room to fit the already large bus. On my left side were the typical cabinets, sink, first aid, and canisters for biological waste along with a trash can. By the back of the bus were the various biological symbols that I have no clue about, aside from the other medical materials of needles, tubes, and canisters for blood bags. On my right was the chair for where the patient would sit although for some reason, there were restraint straps on the chair.



I made a face at it and turned to Maddy. “What’s with the restraints? I thought we’re just taking blood?”



“We are,” she said with her calm gothic demeanor. “Although sometimes they’ll be jumpy and might swipe you to stop. I doubt you’d need it for our patients, but they are there just in case if, well–”



“Okay, I get it, I guess.” I had to agree that it could be a precaution. I just don’t know if that was what would be allowed in any other bus. The more I was overwhelmed by that and the other medical information surrounding me, the more it made me wonder if it was a good idea getting this role.



“Are you sure I would be the right pick?” I asked, feeling a little uncomfortable.



“Oh don’t worry, it’s not really that hard. Look, I’ll show you. Here, take a seat,” She commanded as she motioned to the patient’s chair. I did as she asked, unquestioning. I never knew she had that much of a presence. She sat in the doctor’s chair as she said smoothly “Now watch what I do.”



She prepared the needle with a tube attached, placed the rubber ribbon around my arm to pop the veins more, applied the alcohol patch over my vein, and finally injected the needle in. She looked up to me momentarily as our eyes met. Her ocean eyes, all encompassing.



“Oh, uh, are you afraid of needles?” she said that was more of a whisper. Her crashing waves inundating my skin with goosebumps. I shook my head no. I was afraid of needles like every kid when they were little, which got hard to believe when we get older. Whenever I’d do one, I can just watch the whole thing as they take my blood. I guess that made me uncanny to an extent. Maybe it was what she saw in me?



“Oh no, I’m fine with it.” I said. She smiled as she inserted it in. I felt the pinch and winched before I laxed. I watched the whole thing before turning to her, her haunting beauty. She didn’t look back this time, as her interest was in the blood. She took one capsule of my blood as the demonstration was over. She placed a cloth and band for my arm and threw out the needle to the biological waste bin.



“So that’s pretty much what you have to do.” She said, “Just had to plug the tube into the blood bag instead of this capsule. Do you have any questions? You think you got what it takes?”



“I mean, sure but doesn’t this seem,” I motioned a bit on my seat. “I don’t know, out of my field?”



“Oh no I get it but don’t worry, again, the whole thing is pretty easy. That’s why I want *you* to do this. I work more in the administrative part of this stuff. But my dad had to make me do all this before we started hiring.” First time she mentioned her dad and the business size.



“I thought you work at the day–”



“Yeah, it’s mostly for administrative stuff. I forgot to mention that during the party.” She tucked her hair back behind her ear.



“Okay. … So do I have to sign anything or just,”



“Oh don’t worry, you got the job,” She said quickly before face palming. “Oh, shit I forgot! I just have to ask you some medical questions. Sorry.” I chuckled and told her that it was alright. I thought it was weird, her being fidgety sometimes. I guessed that she was nervous about handling her boyfriend taking her family’s job. Nepotism much, I guess.



“Okay? Shoot.” I said as she began the laundry list of medical questions. Taking any drugs, alcohol consumption, all the usual things. There was one question she asked that I thought was weird. Something around the lines of “are you okay with working night shift only?” I said yes automatically but the question clung on. Was the shift only at night? All night? At the time, I didn’t care, I got the job and a girlfriend which were the only things that concerned me then.



“So that about sums it up. Do you have anything for me?” she said and as she did, she crossed her ivory legs. I had to focus on her face for that question.



“Y-yeah, right. So, don't the blood donors give the patient a blanket?” I asked innocently. I remembered my high school did a blood donation and they said that they gave him a blanket afterwards. Said that it helps the body warm up.



“It’s not necessary, Damian. The patient will be fine.” she said from her black lips. 



Not necessary?, I thought. “Are you sure, cuz I had this friend–”



“Look, darling. I worked on this for a long time, and so far I notice that they’ll just warm up after,” there was an awkward pause before she continued. “So,” she said, her stance frigid, hands in place on her lap. “Is there anything else you want to ask of me?” She leaned a bit when she said that. I felt my cheeks flare and my blood rushing. There was a lot I wanted to say. To do. But after some careful breaths, I went with a small token.  
  


“Uh, I was … wondering if you’d like to go to the mall sometime?” I shot out. “There’s a lot to do there! Especially at night when it lights up. What do you think?”



She just stared at me, as if contemplating something before she placed a hand underneath her chain and replied, “I’d love to, darling. Let’s see how you do on the first shift tonight.”



\*\*\*



At first, I didn’t expect anyone to show up. I spent the whole day waiting around, spinning around the room of the bus. I read and reread the instructions she left about that orientation day, but I didn’t expect it to be this boring. It was whatever since I was getting the money for just being here. If I had still worked at the grocery store, my manager would be bitching to me about staying busy.



It was maybe around 12 am when I heard a knock. It kind of spooked me, but I managed to get up to answer the door. The first patient was hard to see in the dead of night. When I asked him to come inside, that was when I got a good look at him under the bus’ light. He had this derpy smile on his face and seemed to be in a stupor over his glazed eyes. I couldn’t tell if he was drunk or drugged. If it wasn’t any of these things, then that's one weird way to show up to this.



I got my clipboard and pen ready, “Okay, uhh, are you under the influence of drugs or alcohol?”



“No.” he said, plainly.



“Okay,” I said and wrote down his response. Gotta look professional, you know. “Blood type?”



“A Negative.” he said. 



I wrote that too and motioned him to the chair. “Okay. Have a seat, Mr.” I drawled it out to coax anything from him. Nothing. He just went past me and just sat.



I retraced the steps that Maddy showed me and wrapped the straps around his arm and legs. I glanced at him to see he didn’t seem fazed by it at all. Not even a question. Something about it felt weird, and invasive. People usually get apprehensive or try to hide their anxiety with the pinch or not at all but not like this. Regardless, I had to do the procedure as Maddy showed me. Either this guy was really drunk or just some sicko.



I’ll admit, I had some trouble figuring out the right vein, but eventually I found it and did the whole extraction. It felt strange to be the one administering these injections rather than the one getting it. He didn’t wince when I inserted it; he didn’t even look at the needle nor looked away; Just stared out into space. When I tried to converse with him, he did nothing. I tried to get him to say his name, it did nothing. I used my free hand to snap my fingers at his face, but didn't respond at all. *What the fuck*, I thought, beginning to see why Maddy would recommend the straps. The last thing I needed to see was him lunging at me or shaking profusely from whatever trance they’re in.



As the blood bag inflated slowly, my eyes went to examine him. He was a good looking man with a curtain cut of black hair. From his sweatshirt and pants, I guessed he had a late night stroll before heading over here. Is that why he was so dazed? If so, why show up before a make-shift red bus? I didn’t know. Didn’t want to know. His color drained as the blood bag almost filled up, looking more like Madline by the minute. I thought it was weird, but I kept going anyway. As messed up as it sounded, this guy is my first quarter of my paycheck, so I had to do my job. I can’t let her down.



After gathering enough blood, I covered his insertion with medical cloth and tape as I drew out the needle. He still had that aloof look on him even after he looked pale and drained. I told him he can leave now after unstrapping his arms and legs and he just walked out of the bus and into the deep night. After he left, my head let out some deep sigh of relief. Everything seemed to have gone alright, but it was the weirdest thing I’ve seen. Something told me that it wouldn’t be the last. After a few minutes of rest, I unplugged the blood bag, labeled it, and placed it in the fridge. Preparing the next bag for the next patient that knocks.



An hour would go by as the next one came and the one after that. With each patient, I noticed how each patient looked just as unkempt, dirty, and estranged as the last. Each one doing what the first guy did. Each one filling the fridge. Each one, a large stash of cash into my bank account. Despite the first guy, they all shared similar traits but differentiated sometimes. One would look like they were in ecstasy when I inserted the needle, another would mutter something under their breath, and another would just be agape throughout the withdrawal. It started to become a bit more uncomfortable, invasive even. The best I could do was just not focus on them, and I would be fine. Even for a little while.



It was after the 10th patient left did I get a call from Maddy, telling me that my shift was done and said it’s good to go home. I thanked her, hung up and stretched my back a bit. I went over to the sink to wash my hands and face before heading back home, leaving the weirdness and strangeness of this new job behind me for the night.



Days would go by, and I slowly became a nocturnal animal after each “blood shift” as I called it. I had to change my hours with the grocery store just to fit them in. More money for the debt payments to ease my parent’s suffering. Each time the shift was over, she’d call me saying the time is up but sometimes it would be infrequent. Sometimes, it would end after the 5th guy and a night later it was 16 people. I grew annoyed from it, but I didn’t feel that way for too long. The following day was the date me and Madeline planned on, the night at the mall. I was so excited, I ran home when my shift was over. My first date.



\*\*\*



The excitement transferred over to the grocery work at the day. Despite the exhaustion, with Victor and now Madeline in my life, I felt ever so chipper. I was about half an hour to closing my shift when a customer came in for checkout. I was about to greet him merrily until my face dropped from the recognition. Standing before me, setting down beets, berries, and fish, was the first patient.



He looked terrible, as if he just woke up with pneumonia. His face was pale under the yellowish light with bags under the eyes making it as if he struggled to sleep. He wore the same shirt but completely unkempt and drenched in sweat. He was sweating so profusely that his hair was greasy. My back felt tense and my feet felt cold and numb. I doubted he had anything that warmed him that night.



I swallowed my fears and proceeded to start scanning the groceries. As I did, I took my customer's courtesy and asked him, “Good afternoon, sir. How are you today?”



He groaned from his pain, some drool coming from his parched lips as he croaked, “Complete shit. I’m not sure why though, but it's been days feeling this way. I checked my blood pressure only to find out that it was too low. Maybe that’s why I'n so sick these past few days."" He said as he let out another groan. I got a little sick to my stomach too. This doesn’t feel right. Wouldn’t he have known about his appointment? Does he remember at all?



I had to probe. “Uhh, haven’t I seen you before?”



He looked at me with confusion. His damp face twisting to a wince. “What? Oh uh yeah I go to this store every now and then but–”



“No, like,” I tried to think of some lie to say. I tried to hide myself from it when I said, “I saw you at the blood test lab downtown.”



He looked even more confused. “What the fuck are you talking about? I haven't taken any blood test lately,” he said as I bagged the groceries. That’s when I remembered the mark on his arm.



“But what about that dot on your arm? Haven’t you–” I said but he jerked it away and held on to it with his other hand to cover.



He took the groceries and paid before saying, “Mind your own business, asshole.”



I clocked out and headed home. While on the drive, I couldn’t help but think about what that guy said. I mean, he saw the whole thing, didn’t he? He wasn’t drunk so what was it? I didn’t think it was hypnosis either. Sure he looked dazed, but I doubt that shit even works on real people than it does in fiction. Thinking about it made me realize another thing. Since that first guy came, all the others had similar looks to them, sometimes looking more uncanny than the other. Were they feeling just as unwell as he was? My shins felt cold from that notion. I better talk with Madline when we get to the mall.



\*\*\*



I waited for her as I got to the mall entryway earlier. I tried my best with getting her on board with this but only for the weekend night. It was what she agreed to since it was a weekend don’t do my blood shifts then. I was messaging her to know if she was here or almost here. Right when I was about to, she tapped my shoulder.



“Hey, you look great!” I complemented her despite looking as casual as when she was at that house party. I took her hand, cold as it was, and we ventured into the mall. Riddled with sounds of people going about and music playing softly in the background. I leaned over to her ear.



“Have you been to this mall before?” I asked her.



She leaned over to me to do the same with her pouty lips. “I don’t think so. I don’t go out often since I work a lot anyway, you know?” yeah I guess I did know. It made me think of the patients again.



“So, when you did these, uhh, blood shifts, have you ever–”



She looked at me funny. “Blood shifts?”



“Y-yeah, I’ve been calling them that after a while. I thought it would distinguish the job.” I said, a bit embarrassed. She just shook her head and smiled, a smile made from hearing a bad joke. I couldn’t help but smile too.



“Sure. Welcome to the Blood Shift, my darling.” She said, her shoulders poking mine from time to time as we walked. I held her chilled hand from there and swung it gently like a see-saw. I forgot then what I even asked of her. We kept walking around until I led her to the first stop: The Hot Topic.



“Alright! Let’s check out some clothes that’s–” That was when I felt her touch slip from mine. I looked at her confused. She didn’t move at all when she saw the store sign.



“Hey come on,” I said. “Don’t gothic girls like Hot Topic?”



That was when I noticed her face more. She seemed more apprehensive as if a dog at the vet. I tapped her shoulder to get her off the shock to which she looked at me when I asked about it. She slowly gave out a nervous smile back. “Oh yeah I get that it’s just,” she reached for my hand again, leaned very close to my ear as she whispered to me over her veil of hair, “I-I don’t like mirrors.”



It took me a while to set in. I didn’t understand, at first, but the best I could do was to nod and proceed to show her something else. We went through other places. A candy store, gaming stores, a Starbucks. All the while wondering about her apparent phobia with mirrors. It was when we got to the food court that I started talking to her about it.



“Oh um, I have anorexia. It just makes me feel nervous whenever I see mirrors because, well, I don’t like seeing myself in them, you know?” She said as she took a bite off her burger. I found it strange. I didn’t think she was too thin nor too fat either; she looked just fine to me, no matter how she saw herself.



“You sure that’s what anorexia is? Isn’t that an eating disorder too?” I asked.



She gulped and gulped again as if she choked on something. “Oh yeah I’ve been working with my therapist on that. It’s been 30 days, and I’ve made a lot of progress.” She said, regaining composure.



“Oh,” I said, feeling a little shitty asking her that despite how normal it was. Thinking back on it, I should have asked more about her anorexia, but I wanted to ask her about something else. The first patient flashed in my mind. 



“Yeah, so I met my first patient again,” I chirped. I looked up to see her stop chewing and just stared at me. It made me want to find the next words correctly. “He didn’t look very good, almost as if sick days after his visit. I don’t know, have you ever seen patients appear, I don’t know, weird?”



She swallowed her bite before replying, “yes, I forgot to mention that the patients would be a bit odd when they arrive. That's all.”



“Yeah but,” I thought of the first patient again. “He really didn’t look too good. I know you said the blankets aren’t necessary but are you sure that–”



“Oh, he’s just getting attention is all.” she said sharply.



The sudden reply took me back. “He didn’t remember it at all. Don’t you think that's weird?”



“It was late, Damian. He probably just forgot since it was at night. Okay?” She said, although her voice was strained, as if annoyed by these questions. I wondered if I was ruining it for us. It was our first date after all, and I didn’t want to spoil it. 



Maybe she’s right. Maybe the guy just didn’t remember.



After we ate, I showed her the best for last. Situated at the center of the mall was the water fountain. I found a bench next to some interior plants. We watched the water skipping around the pool making traced motions and shapes that sparkled under the mall lights. It was beautiful to watch. I looked over to her, and she just looked. Was she impressed? I couldn’t tell from her blank expression.



“Uh, hey you got a coin?” I chirped to her. She turned to me to shake her head.



“I didn’t know they had a water fountain. Guess it was on me then.” she gave a short laugh after.



It’s a good thing I brought two then. “Don’t worry I got some quarters.” I said as I tried to take them out. Despite the struggle, I plucked them out.



“What’s wrong?” She said, a lil worried from my reaction.



“Oh it’s nothing. Ow, fuck! I just–” I took a look and was surprised. The tip of my finger was releasing a small dot of blood coming out, almost like a water balloon. Forgot to take out my workname pin. FUCK. I looked at Maddy to show her I was alright. Although, I took a pause when I noticed her expression. Her eyes widened as she stared at my finger which was the most emotive she had been since the Hot Topic. It was different, more afire than frightened.



“Oh no, it’s okay. It’s just some blood is all. Look let me just–” I tried to suck my own thumb when her hands slowly wrapped around my arm, drawing her closer. “Here, let me” she said softly as she took it in, sucking my bleeding finger in her mouth. Twisting her tongue around it as well as feeling her teeth against the soft skin of my wounded finger. Her expression changed, savouring it almost. I just gave her a weird look from it all, trying to suppress my … arousal? I thought I wasn’t into this; guessing that she was kinda freakier than I imagined.



Eventually she let go, her face softened and huffing from the supposed ecstacy. I just stared at her, weirded out while feeling heated. Was she turned on? It was when I examined my finger that I looked shocked. The cut is completely gone, as if it never bled. I just stared at it for so long that I forgot my words before they came back to me.

I went back to look at her. “How did you do that?” I said, bewildered.

“I’m not sure,”  she said, her eyes ablaze with some ounce of red passion as she blushed. “It’s what my father taught me.” She said before she took my collar to lean me in for a kiss. Out of nowhere. My brain flashed endless fireworks. Stimulation overtook me as I kissed her back. Her face was flushed and blushy. Under the moonlight and sprinkling water, that was our first kiss.



I pulled back to get some air, and some answers. “Okay, but how did you do that? And what was up with you–”



She cut me off to whisper. “Damian. It’s what I'm good at.” and drove back to kiss me again.



I couldn’t remember the rest of the night after.



\*\*\*



I remembered the next day it was raining cats and dogs outside in the damp gray evening when another patient knocked nonchalantly. This guy did not look like some ordinary person. He looked like a homeless man you’d see by the alleyway. Judging from his wrinkles and beard hair, he looked no older than my overworked dad. His dazed face and glazed eyes just made me more uncomfortable with the job again. I just did the usual, motioned him to the seat and strapped him in. Picked out the needle and did the other things like any other.



As I did, my mind was thinking about that night. It was the first kiss I ever got from Madeline. The sweet taste of her lips and her bite. I won’t go any further but I cannot keep her off my mind now. I looked over at the patient again, dazed and mouth agaped. I figured that I’d take a nap. I mean, if I was going to work late at night, I might as well slip in one. The blood bag takes a long time for it to fill anyway.



As my mind drifted to sleep, I could see the slow projection of my visions come into view. I remembered standing by a beach of some kind. The vision was so hazy that I couldn't make out anything beyond my hand. The cold breeze of the ocean in its misty quintessence and the moonlight white illuminating the sandy ground and sea beyond. Further out, I saw a figure from afar walking across the sand as if he was in some kind of spell. Walking towards a clawed hand as if beckoning to him, accompanied with the two pale dots. The rest of the person was shrouded in a silhouette as if behind some curtain. I remembered running towards the figure in some weird attempt to get to save them. I didn’t feel the sand on my feet nor the misty wind in the air. I ran and shouted despite nothing coming out, the pale eyes and the figure looked right at me so suddenly. The figure tried to jerk away from the horror enticing him as I saw the vague monster lunge at me. It was then that I awoke.



Awoken in a cold sweat to the horror of the patient gasping and screaming. His dazed look was completely gone, replaced with eyes darting around and at me. He looked at the blood bag and then at me. I felt my heart drop to its stomach. He shaked around despite the straps screaming about wanting out. I didn't know what to do but to calm him.



“SIR, SIR PLEASE CALM down, it's alright!” I said with my hands stretched to keep him steady on the seat. I never saw a man look this scared in my entire life, and I was on edge with whoever I let in.



He started to wheeze and sob from the horror, “Please, please don’t kill me! W-Why are you taking my blood?”



My eyes looked around for an answer. I didn’t know how to even answer that. “Sir, calm down, I’m not gonna kill you! I’m just gonna- ""I stopped before saying the rest. What? Take his blood? You really think that’ll calm him down? He was acting like everyone else up until now! I had to think about something else as some kind of alibi. As he started to stop shaking around and whimpering, I thought of one. “I’m just taking an exam on your wellness.”



He sniffed back his mucus before steading himself at his seat, his focus on the needle. “Uhh, uh, h-h-how did I get here? I don’t, I don’t–”



“You... didn’t set up an appointment or something?” This confirmed my suspicions with the first patient. Hell, I doubt this guy knew anything about his blood type.



“What appointment? I don’t even remember how I got here,” He said as he looked at me. “Can you please take this fucking things off me,” It was just like meeting the first guy at that store again. Only now it filled me with dread with him seeing me. In this place. I didn’t know what else to do as he grew impatient from my hesitations. “What the hell kind of wells check is this!?” I knew that I couldn’t. Otherwise, he would assault me or run to the police. My mind raced for something to do. Anything. The room felt hot and claustrophobic as my mind and anxiety ramped up to eleven. I searched for something to say.



Then again, this was my only chance. “Okay, I need to ask. What was the last thing you remember? Do you recall anything before you got here? If you can do that for me, I’ll let you out of those straps, okay?” He nodded with agreement. This was my only chance to get something out. I wiped his eyes and blew his nose before waiting for his answer.



It took him a while though, “I was just sitting around by the street. I heard someone walking towards me. \[wheeze\]. It was so dark, I couldn’t have seen them but,” he looked over at me. His lost hazel green staring back. “They, they had them glowden eyes! Like two pale moons, I saw them! I felt as if I was a dreamin’. I saw a moon with stars crashing against the waves of some beach. I wuz followin’ someone as I did but I heard shouting and a man from far behind, and I wuz here.” He moved his arms against the straps. “Please mister, let me go, "" You promised that you’ll let me go! I answered what ya asked. I promise I won’t tell anyone! I swear! I’m sorry! Please! PLEASE!!”



I was frozen there now. I wasn’t sure what would’ve happened if I would. Oh God, Madline was gonna kill me. Why a homeless person? “Hold on sir, I’ll get someone to help.” I got up to find my phone before heading out of the bus. Trying to tune out his desperate pleas to be let out. I did the only thing I could do and called Maddy about the whole situation.



“I see,” she said coldly. “I’ll be over.” And just like that she hung up.



She came an hour later. “Stay outside, I’ll handle this but stay out here!” she told me. While I was concerned, I did as she told me and waited out in the damp outdoors. The rain stopped but the smell of it was still here. I was left pacing back and forth about what would happen to him. I’m not sure what will happen now. Is she going to break out with me? Tell me not to do that again? The door opened and he got out first, walked past me and into the night without acknowledging me. Next came Maddy who looked at me with some kind of contempt on her face.



“I-I’m sorry that I messed up–” I started before she held up a hand. Her face had a cold, restrained anger behind it. Her eyes crashed like the waves that once alluded me. I grew very afraid of what she might do.



“I *never* want to hear you fucking say that, EVER!” she hissed. “Do you understand that!” She repeated but louder. I wanted to slip out and run, but my legs betrayed me. She quivered from the sheer emotion of her anger towards me. It was as if I failed her that night.  
  
All I could do was whimper and squirm out, “I-I understand. P-p-please just–” and she let go. I rubbed my face when I was broken free, looked at her with more fear than ever.



She pinched her nose as her anger passed. “Whatever, ” she said sharply. “I do NOT want you sleeping on the job!” 

“I’m sorry, it won’t happen again,” I said. That was when I realized something she said. “ Wait, how did you know—“

Whatever, Damian! What else would have caused the guy to wake up after extracting too much!” she said, making exaggerated motions. I was just there feeling helpless and ashamed. She saw the shame on my face and started to caress my face. “I just don’t want you messing this up, baby. I know that we all make mistakes but for this job, I *really* don’t want you to make any. Can you do that for me?” The shift of her tone left me mildly comforted, but I could only suspect it was just to save face. I nodded and told her it won’t happen again. The blood shift ended that night.

At home, I just felt sour ending it on that bad note, but I felt I deserved it for sleeping on the job. Then again, I knew something was very wrong here. I remembered what the man said. *Glowing or pale eyes peering into the night, an ocean with stars and a moon, dream-like*. It was those crumbs of words that those other patients were saying. Does Madline even know or was this something else entirely? I mean, sure she can assume that I was napping but how did she *know*? As if she saw me doing so? The more I thought about it, the more I wondered where that money really came from.



The next morning, Victor didn’t have work. I called him about what’s been happening lately with the patients and that dream with the homeless one. He got a bit silent from what I was describing.



“There is something I gotta talk to you about.” He said sternly.



“What do you mean?” I asked. That was when he described yesterday. He was taking the groceries out for this one guy to which he bantered during the transaction. He mentioned me working for Maddy’s donorship bus to which the guy got cold.



“He said that he has also been working with Madline recently. From what he described, it reminded me of you. I mentioned about you, and now he says he wants to meet you. Are you interested?” he said. I did remember Maddy saying that she’s hiring. Maybe I can get something from him.



“Alright.”I said as we said our goodbyes and hung up. I stared up at the ceiling of my room with the things that Victor just told me about. I could just quit, put it all behind me but to go back to doing just the grocery store? And what about this person just now?



There was only one way to find out.



\*\*\*



We waited for a while now. Me and Victor got us a table for this guy as we waited for about 30 minutes for this guy to arrive which made my butt hurt from the metal seat. My feet were kicking like a drum player to an invisible bass drum.



“So when is this guy gonna come?” I asked, feeling impatient from the wait. My coffee, already cold.



“I’m not sure. He said he’s a bit far from the city so it may take a while for him to arrive. Oh look there he is!” he pointed and waved to him. He looked tall but his face was a bit gaudy. Had a beanie on top and a misfit shirt on to match. We shook hands and took a table over to greet him. 



He sat nonchalantly as he took a sip of his drink. “E yeah, whatever was happening, she’s got some shit going on I didn’t yet see,” He said to me. Darted his eyes on the both of us before looking around. “I graduated in the hopes to be a doctor but with the student debt and the job market going tits up, I had to find something to at least get something going. It was then that I met Madeline by a bus stop, and she offered me the job–”



“Wait, I thought she worked that day.”I blurted out.



He just shrugged and said, “I mean, I guess it was a weekend or something, but it was a long time ago, so I don’t know. Although I couldn’t tell who she was from her jacket and pants covering her up entirely. I assumed it was Porphyria or something like that. Maybe –” 



“The hell is Porphyria?” Victor said.



“Oh yeah, it’s this rare disease that causes skin irritation under the sun. Burning of the skin kind of sensitivity, you know? Where was I– Oh yeah!” He said as he went on about his start for his blood shifts. I never knew Maddy had something that rare. Not only that, but it must be really sad to have to avoid the day while feeling guilty with how she sees herself in mirrors, if she even sees anything at all at this point.



Anyway, the guy began mentioning how he noticed the same stuff that I’ve dealt with: The aloofness, the daze in the eye and just the uncanny mutterings as if they were in deep sleep. I felt somewhat relieved with how I wasn’t the only one that was having this experience, but he added something in his testimony.



“There was this one patient that showed signs of R.E.M sleep! I had to examine this discovery and so I went over to check on them. I’ve studied as much as I did about how the human body works, but I’ve never seen anything like this. The eyes were dilating! The patient was overwhelmed in their cognition, whatever their dream was. Not only that, they were contracting too!”



“What gives?” I asked.



“The thing is that contractions in the eyes couldn’t be done under light exposure. Usually under sleep, they wouldn’t respond to such things but this patient did,” He rambled as he took a sip to his coffee again. Scratching his neck as if a mosquito bit it all throughout. I couldn’t tell if he was making this shit up, or if he really saw this.



He kept on rambling, “I was as spooked as you were when the patient showed distress, and like you, I managed to calm them down. After they came to, I was able to ask the patient about what drove them there. They mention those same descriptions of those two, pale moon eyes staring back and the beckoning hand. Eyes like sapphire jewels. It reminded me of those eyes nocturnal animals got, helping them see more in the dark.



Anyway, I just let the patient go. I called Madeline about the patient not being a good candidate for blood donorship. Made up a story about their critical condition or something. She sounded frustrated but bought my refusal. Days later, I found a nursing role for the city hospital. I took the opportunity to tell her about my resignation” he chuckled at that, scratching more of his mosquito bitten neck. I wondered just how many times he applied only to get just one offer. “But I don’t know. All of this makes me wonder if I was in some sort of trafficking ring or some shit. Even then, it was strange how fine she was with the resignation than with how queer the patients were acting. If she had her way, she wouldn’t want anyone to leave, wouldn't she?” he looked at me as if waiting for a response.  
  
I didn’t know what to say other than, “I don’t think so.”



“Hmph. Well I hope to hell it isn’t,” he looked over at me. “But either way, I don’t trust her after all that shit. There’s something wrong about this, and I don’t want to stick around to find out. I suggest that you do the same.” He said before getting up to shake our hands again. “Thanks for the coffee, and I wish you guys the best.” And with that he turned and left, leaving me and Victor to take it all in.



“You know that thing he said with the eyeshine reminded me of something.” Victor said, twisting his crucifix around and around..



“What do you mean? I said.



“Do you know what Skinwalkers are?” he inquired.



I let out a scoff, “Come on man,” I said. “That's stupid!”



“Then what else could explain those sleep-walking patients? I know it’s stupid, but what could be leading these patients to the buses?”



“Well then, do you think–” I stammered before he cutted in.



“I don’t know. Maybe the skinwalker is coercing her to operate this whole thing? After all, they can get into one’s head as well as transforming. ” he said, although a bit uncertain.   
  
I wasn’t sure what I could even do if that was the case. I can rely a lot from Victor’s insight but there are times where I don’t think he can help out. He went to get his crucifix around his neck and gave them to me. “Look, I don’t know how religious you are, but if anything, maybe it’ll help you find peace in all of this. Just give it a try, man.” He said as I took his offer. I thanked him for it but I'm not sure. I’m not all that religious but who knows, maybe it would find me peace. As I walked to my car, I thought I saw something a few blocks down. Someone darting out before I could make out anything. The skinwalker, maybe.



When I got back home, I went back to staring blank around my room for a while trying to make sense of it. It could very well be some kind of operation but … really? I mean it does explain the salary, I guess, but what about those pale eyes? Victor must really be pulling my leg on that one implying that she’s working with some cryptid to lure people into a blood donorship bus. But then again, what else would make sense of all this. It got me to check out about the skinwalkers stuff online. Read the bio and what they can do seems to line up, I guess, but not quite.



It was there, amongst the list of others like it did I find one that I was enticed with. It almost spiraled into a rabbit hole of names like chubacabra and all the capabilities relating to blood-sucking cryptids and mythical monsters until I felt a buzz in my pocket as I reached down to my phone.



A message from Madline.



“I’d like for you to come over to my house. I’m giving you a promotion.”



I looked at the word confused if not unnerved with the words. A promotion? For drawing blood from people? Especially after messing up with that one homeless patient?



I messaged back, “What do you mean a promotion? Why?”



“I just want to give you something for all your hard work :-) ”



This made me grow more uneasy. The things I’ve learned from that med student, Victor’s implications, and my online sleuthing gave a chill up my spine. I had to make a response before she’d get any more ideas.



“Uh sure, I’d be over, when?” I said.

The Memphis Grizzlies, fresh off a 7-game losing streak and a defense that’s more sieve than shield (allowing 130+ points in their last two games), will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on November 15. The Cavs, 8-5 and riding a 6-game Over streak, are favored by -11.5 points. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Ja Morant crossover.

**The Spread:**  
Cleveland’s -11.5 line? That’s basically a “free points” prop for a Cavs team that’s outscored opponents by 11.5 PPG in their last three games. The Grizzlies, meanwhile, have a *combined* 4-9 record and a defense that’s been outscored by 13 PPG this season. Take the Cavs like you take your morning coffee—bold and unflinching.

**Over/Under 240.5 Total Points:**  
With Memphis scoring 117 PPG and Cleveland allowing 124 PPG, this feels like a pick-up game at the local park. The Over is a no-brainer. The Grizzlies’ porous D and the Cavs’ *actual* offense (114 PPG) will make this a points bonanza. Bet Over like it’s 2021 and you’re still bitter about the

Now, we want my Mom to feel as cared for as possible so we are trying to both help her celebrate and spoil her. We will watch the parade on the morning of Thanksgiving day and have cinnamon rolls and fancy coffees. I have a normal coffee maker and an original Nespresso machine that makes both espresso and coffee. I also have a 2 cup frother that will work hot or cold. 

I drink decaf espresso with a shot of heavy whipping cream but I’d really like to get some flavored creamers and cold foam (what is that?!) and whipped cream and syrups or anything else that might be fun to add to a coffee. 

I need recommendations. My mom is pretty open to new things so what are people drinking? What should I buy? What would make this coffee experience more like going to a cafe?

I’m looking for some perspective and advice because I’m struggling emotionally with the lack of support from my family.

I have a 3-year-old and I’m currently pregnant with my second child. My husband is a foreigner and his family lives 11 hours away by car, so we have no support from that side at all.

My own family is complicated. My father is very narcissistic. My mom is quite a simple person who mainly cares about her appearance and doesn’t really engage beyond that. She loves coming over for a quick coffee, cuddling my son for a few minutes, I serve snacks, and they leave with a smile. But any real support — taking him out, watching him for a bit, or offering help without being asked — just doesn’t happen.

My brother lives 30 minutes away, has plenty of free time, but is very introverted and focused on his own mental health. We’ve always had a good relationship, but he shows almost no interest in my son unless I invite him. And even if I invite him he comes only when its suitable for him. There’s simply no initiative from anyone.

After the birth of my first son, things were extremely hard. I went through what I now know was postpartum depression. My son had colic, reflux, and cried constantly. No one helped. No one even brought food. My mom stayed one night to “help,” but left the next day saying she was exhausted and needed to rest — leaving us completely on our own. That experience left a deep emotional mark.

So my husband and I are basically doing everything alone. I have lovely friends, but they live far away, so we don’t see each other often. Now that I’m pregnant again, all the old wounds feel like they’re reopening.

It hurts even more when I hear other moms talk about how their parents take the kids every week or actively help without being asked. I have to ask for everything, and even then it feels like too much for my family. And on top of that, I get labelled as “needy” or “dramatic.” I feel misunderstood and even ashamed — like a burden.

Sometimes I honestly don’t know if I’m overreacting… if I’m expecting too much… or if the real issue is simply that my family isn’t capable of providing the support that many other families naturally do. I feel lost because I can’t tell whether the problem is in me or in them.

I’ve been to therapy, and it helps for a while, but the disappointment always returns — a small gesture gives me hope, and then something immediately crushes it again. My childhood wasn’t easy, and the emotional connection was never strong. It hurts to see how little has changed.

How do you cope when your family simply isn’t the supportive family you wish you had? How do you stop hoping for something that might never happen?

Any perspective or advice is really appreciated.",7,1763234952.0,Mommit,8,1.0,False

240mm Matsubara Blue #2 Nashiji gyuto:  I picked it up a few months ago. It’s a great knife, just don’t use it much.  Sharpened once on 1000 Shapton glass and used less than 5 times for meal prep at home. Pretty patina on core steel. Paid $260 at Chubo. Asking price $220 shipped

240mm Shiro Kamo White#2 Damascus clad gyuto: I’ve had this one for about a year. Only have needed to strop it. The cladding is pretty reactive, so I forced a coffee patina on it to help stabilize. Pretty much removed it before posting, so you can put your own on. Paid $160 at CKTG. Asking $130 shipped

165mm Shiro Kamo Blue#2 kurouchi Nakiri: Thin as hell, but too short for my mitts, especially since I picked up a 210 Nakiri. Bought from CKTG for $120. Asking $100.

Before MBA I was making a living with (in part) stakeholder management and I was great at it. Then I move to the US, enroll in a M7, 2 years of transactional relationships and coffee chats later, I am back to client facing and stakeholder management.

Last week I was at a work related event where I should be establishing connections and exchange business cards and I felt mentally destroyed after it. Realized I prefer to suck Bill Clinton's dick than be thrown in a room to do hours of small talk again. Something I was a natural before bschool, but I guess the intensity and superficiality of it really burned me off.

After about three months of work (and a lot of late nights and coffee), I’ve finally finished building my app called **Listist**.

It’s a simple but powerful app to help you create and manage lists of anything – things you want to do, remember, or try. Instead of scribbling things in a notebook or juggling between random note apps, you can make all kinds of lists in one place. Want to track movies to watch, restaurants to visit, books to read, or places to travel? Listist can handle all of that.

What makes it different is that it’s **AI-powered**. You can create lists using AI, optimize them, or even get smart suggestions based on what type of list you’re making. It currently uses **Google Gemini**, and I’m running it on a free key for now, so there might be the occasional slowdown or temporary error due to rate limits. If the response is good, I’ll switch to the paid version for smoother performance.

You can also **share your lists** with friends or invite them as members so they can add their own ideas too. Think shared trip plans, movie nights, or bucket lists you build together. There’s also a **public list** option, where you can post lists that anyone can view or save if they like. For example, you could make a public list of must-watch animes or your favorite travel spots.

I built this app because I kept losing my notes and wanted one simple, beautiful place to keep everything I care about – and to make it smart enough to help me out.

If you like exploring new apps, give [Listist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voythrix.listist&pcampaignid=web_share) a try. It’s available now on the Play Store. I’d love your honest feedback – what works, what doesn’t, what could be better. Leave a review (good or bad) and I’ll keep improving it based on what you think.

Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **CRB vs Vila Nova: A Match for the Ages (Or at Least the Survival of Vila Nova’s Dignity)**

The 37th round of Brazil’s Série B brings us to a clash of contrasts: **Clube de Regatas Brasil (CRB)**, the 10th-place “canoe club” with a knack for home comforts, and **Vila Nova**, the away side whose name sounds like a real estate listing but whose football form reads like a broken sprinkler system—spritzing hope, but mostly soaking in despair. Let’s parse the odds, news, and why this game might as well be a math final for Vila Nova.

---

### Odds Breakdown: CRB’s Implied Invincibility

The bookmakers have spoken, and they’ve done so with the enthusiasm of a spreadsheet finally balancing. CRB is the overwhelming favorite at **1.43 decimal odds** (≈69.9% implied probability), while Vila Nova is a +700 underdog (≈14.3%). Even the draw, at 4.2 (≈23.8%), feels like a Hail Mary from a team that’s never scored on a spreadsheet.

Why the lopsided pricing? CRB’s home form is as reliable as a coffee machine in a writers’ room. Manager **Rafael Lacerda**’s side has a defensive fortress at home, leaking less than a goal per game here. Meanwhile, Vila Nova’s attack is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine. The total goals market is leaning **under 2.5** (odds \~1.8–1.9), suggesting this could be a tactical tug-of-war rather than a fireworks show.

---

### **Team News: CRB’s “I’ve Seen Better” and Vila Nova’s “Please, God, Just One Win”

CRB enters this match with the urgency of a team that’s already mathematically safe but still wants to end the season on a high note. Their last match? A 1-0 loss to Criciúma, which feels like a “near-perfect” performance if you’re a fan of *meh*. Key man **\[insert star player here\]** is healthy, and their midfield looks like a spreadsheet optimized for efficiency—no flair, but no errors either.

Vila Nova, on the other hand, is a team playing with house money. Literally. If they’re in the relegation zone (and let’s a

Here are some of my thoughts about the game:

Interesting things:

* In my third run I hid the truth: When you initially meet Flambae in episode 1. You have the choice of using water or alcohol. With alcohol you burn his eyebrows, but then by episode 7 it's fixed? It's assumed that you told the group in episode 6 your identity as Mechaman. But if you hid the truth, then it's a bit weird in how Flambae fixed either his teeth or eyebrows. Both are still hilarious.
* Phenomaman has such weird/funny quotes during missions if you pay attention enough.
* I didn't realize until my second playthrough that the coffee in episode 7 was spiked. But then it reminded me there are better ways of making irish coffee (from experience).
* It may just be because first playthrough I went in blind, and second and third playthrough I knew what I was doing: Facing Sonar during episode 8 during the dispatch felt far more challenging than Coupe. Whereas storywise it felt like Sonar was a better fit as part of the RedRing group than Coupe.
* In episode 7, it felt really, really odd to hear Coupe saying ""Okay mom"" if you initially kicked her from the team. It didn't really fit her character personally.

Off topic interesting thing:

* Third run went for ""We can just be friends"": When rejecting Blonde Blazer you can hear her say ""what the fuck"" after just trying be professional. As someone who went for Blonde Blazer in the first playthrough, that REALLY REALLY hurt doing this, but was necessary.

Achievements

* First and foremost: H4ck3d by R0b3rt as of this post date is still bugged. I've ran it with all episodes without reset, done all the hacking missions (even rescuing Flambae from the deprivation tank) and defeating Mindfucker before going after Sonar/Coupe. I've done it without being hit by the anti-virus as well on my third run. It was helpful to get the list of hacking missions from here by Ghosty: [https://steamcommunity.com/app/2592160/discussions/0/682985658886744179/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2592160/discussions/0/682985658886744179/)
* My third run, I intentionally went for ""Didn't see that coming"" achievement. From what I can tell, you can keep leveling up Invisigal and sending her on missions to get a high success rate AND help her during the hacking mission. It's preferred that you don't meet her up at the movies around episode 4 and go with Blonde Blazer. The way you talk with Invisigal matters more during the choices.

The Lakers and Bucks clash in Milwaukee, and if this game were a Netflix series, it’d be titled *“Giannis vs. the Ghost of LeBron’s Absence.”* Let’s parse the chaos with the precision of a stathead who’s seen too many highlight reels.

**1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Bucks are favored (-1.5) but come with a caveat: their bench is thinner than a $2 gym membership. They’re missing Taurean Prince and Kevin Porter Jr., leaving Cole Anthony and Bobby Portis to fend for themselves. Meanwhile, the Lakers, despite missing LeBron James (back) and Gabe Vincent (ankle), have Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, and Deandre Ayton forming a trio that’s like a tricycle—unstable but occasionally explosive.

Implied probabilities? The Bucks’ moneyline (1.85) suggests a 54% chance to win, while the Lakers’ 2.0 odds imply 50%. But here’s the twist: the Lakers’ +1.5 spread line (1.91) hints at a 52% implied chance to cover. Why? Because the Bucks’ defense is a sieve—allowing 118.8 PPG—and the Lakers’ offense, while not elite, isn’t exactly a wet noodle (116.1 PPG).

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Bench Woes, and a Dash of Drama**  
The Bucks’ bench is so depleted, their second unit could be mistaken for a group of accountants on a coffee break. Without Prince and Porter Jr., their scoring depth drops from “meh” to “oh no.” The Lakers? They’re leaning on Luka Doncic, who’s averaging 24 PPG and 8.7 RPG, and Austin Reaves, who’s scoring 28.6 PPG—proof that when you’re stuck in a LeBron-shaped void, you either step up or start a TikTok dance trend.

Giannis Antetokounmpo is the Greek Freak, but even he can’t single-handedly fix a team that ranks 24th in bench scoring. Meanwhile, the Lakers’ rebounding (40.7 RPG) is worse than a toddler’s attempt at a sandcastle, but Ayton’s 13 RPG average might keep them from drowning entirely.

1oxzxt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1oxzxt9/ahh_schadenfreude_nothing_makes_me_happier/,"Ahh, schadenfreude. Nothing makes me happier! [Discussion]","I was up late last night and was just about to go to bed when I realized that it was almost the proposed release time. I thought, ""Well, I might as well log in and let it download the update while I sleep."" It was still a little early though, so there wasn't a new launcher just yet. I open up YouTube, and there's every Tarkov streamer just salivating, getting ready to pounce on that content. There are thousands of chatters yammering away into the void with nobody listening to anyone else.

And then it happens, it's release time! Launcher updates, says the bad gateway error... oh yeah, there's tons of people trying to do this, it's probably going to be like this for a while. I'll try again when I wake up. Flip back over and look at a couple streams and the sheer insanity as the chat is just zooming by with thousands of people complaining. Not one single person reading, but thousands of main characters thinking they're the only person in the movie, crying in frustration, lashing out at the universe that revolves around solely them, ""WHY? HOW? How could this happen to me?!""

I smile, a warm glow enveloping my body as a sense of peace and calm washes over me. Yes, everything is right in the world. I turn off my monitor and go to sleep.

I awaken seven hours later, shamble into the kitchen to make myself a cup of coffee, sit at my desk, turn on my monitor... oh yeah! Tarkov! Open the launcher... error. Okay, still overloaded. Open the website, 30 minute wait? Ha! That's hilarious! Open Reddit, tens of thousands of posts, all crying out in anger, ""HOW COULD THEY LET THIS HAPPEN TO ME!"" I rub my hands together, oh this is going to be delicious. The overflowing bounty of the tears of the selfish, self centered, self important, narcissistic, immature, main character, center of the universe, worst people to have ever lived... it's almost too much. I giggle like a child, giddy with schadenfreude. I queue up Avenue Q's song ""Schadenfreude"", my giggle turns to a cackle and then a full belly laugh, like Emperor Palpatine. Unlimited drama!

Oh, it couldn't have happened to a better community. No community could have deserved this more. The only single thing that could have been better would be if BSG closed up shop, pulled down the servers, went offline for good, took the money and ran. I wouldn't be able to contain myself, I would literally fall to the ground, dying in laughter. If only...

I go outside, it's a beautiful day. Maybe one of the last nice days before winter finally closes in. I sit in the sun with my coffee and my phone. You couldn't pry the smile off of my face with a crowbar. Then, a thought: Heath Ledger's Joker. ""Why so serious?""

I pull out my phone and write this post. Laughing as I can only imagine the furious reactions. Giggling like a doofus farting in a bathtub. The Faith No More song ""Ricochet"" plays in my head, the chorus ringing out, ""It's always fun until someone gets hurt, and then it's just hilarious."" Will anyone find the humor in this with me? How many keyboard warriors will accuse me of locking BGS' boots? How many will make disparaging remarks about me as a player or person? How many will assume I'm some burned player who took my ball and went home years ago and came back to twist the knife?

I rub my hands together again as a breeze kicks up, rustling the leaves around my yard. I can't wait. More, more, I need more...",3,1763233448.0,EscapefromTarkov,2,0.67,False

How should I handle this professionally?","I recently started a seasonal job (Nov–May) as an Activities Center Attendant at a very high-end country club. It’s a 6-hour morning shift, and most of my duties are guest-experience focused:
1. keeping towels stocked at the pool, tennis courts, and gym
2. straightening chairs at the pool
3. restocking locker room items like razors, deodorant, shampoo, etc.
4. assisting guests and helping with appointments
5. keeping the building organized and presentable

I’m totally fine with all of that. It fits the job description I was hired for.

What I don’t feel okay about is being expected to clean the locker rooms like a janitor things like scrubbing sinks, showers, mirrors, etc. The facility is huge, and with the holiday season coming, it’s only going to get busier. This feels like a whole separate job that normally housekeeping should handle. And I am wearing a uniform with long pants that’s REQUIRED to wear “long pants”.

A girl that I am hanging out with told me something along the lines of:

“It’s not unreasonable to feel that way. Your role is different, and deeper cleaning is usually for housekeeping. It’s good that you work hard, but the job shouldn’t take advantage of that. Hopefully they bring in the right staff as the busy season picks up.”

I agree with her. I don’t want to quit because my second job barely gives me hours, and I’m trying to save up so I can eventually move out on my own. But at the same time, I don’t want to get stuck doing work that isn’t actually part of my position.

How should I bring this up professionally?
Do I talk to my supervisor now? Do I wait until it actually becomes a repeated issue? How do I say it in a way that doesn’t make me seem lazy but keeps my job boundaries clear?

Now at 17 caffeine has a much bigger effect on me and I’m not sure how or why. Even drinking a tiny Red Bull, I have shortness of breath and my head feels like I’m in a movie, like I’m just watching everything and I feel pretty twitchy. I also notice myself talking a lot.

I rarely do drink caffeine, maybe twice a month, and it always has the same effect. However, when I have a 20oz coke that caffeine has no effect on me and I remember one time I had a cup of coffee and it kept me awake the whole night, however I didn’t feel shaky or fake.

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in NRW, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'd say I'm kinda cute? (I'll send selfies early on so you can be the judge of that yourself!). I'll be finished with my law degree next month and I currently work in public administration in an upper-level role.



**In my free time, I'm into**



* **Reading**
* **Artsy stuff** (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos)
* **Cooking** (I love showing care through food!)
* **Gaming** (would love to play some co-op together c: - big fan of co-op horror if that's your vibe!)
* **Binge-watching shows** (wanna watch Stranger Things S5 together when it comes out? My taste is pretty broad and ranges from Gravity Falls to Chernobyl)
* **Fitness** (Lifting, and I'm a martial arts newbie - getting less foldable by the day)
* **Traveling** (I was in Seoul spontaniously a couple days ago)
* **Self-care** (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.



**What I hope we'll build**

  
I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, and consistency. When we like each other, we act like it.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability & Dependability
* Availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity (and good, direct communication)
* A bit of silly, dry, gentle humor and teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.



**Little dreams about us**



I'd love to travel a lot with you and make many memories! I'm already planning to go to Lapland and Japan/Taipei next year - ideally with the right person. A few dream spots:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (🙏PLEASE look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together in a van (maybe one that we build together?) and the same through rural Japan

That said, I'm also a bit of a homebody. Day-to-day, I picture steady and cozy weeknights, with new experiences on weekends and holidays. And if we do end up working out, my favorite thing to do together, especially in winter, would always be cuddling up and watching shows in bed together.



**Thanks for reading <3**

  
I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that someone is missing (You!😗). Like the titel implies, I´d prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier.



**So, get in those DMs already!**

  
A quick hello with your age and the city you're in is a perfect start. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions!

1oxzqs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MidTwentiesIndia/comments/1oxzqs4/how_to_come_out_of_this/,How to come out of this?,"I (25M) have a friend (28F) who came into my life 3 years ago when I was attending a conference. I typically avoid people because I'm an introvert and I don’t find most people mentally attractive. But when I met her, things turned out completely different. The coffee talks with her were so fun. The lunch breaks became the best part of the day. We shared so many stories about our lives and we became really close. I never approached her thinking I would court her.

Today, I was out shopping with her and she was buying clothes for her husband. She kept clicking pictures and constantly calling him to know if he liked or disliked the garments she had chosen for him. For a moment I froze and wondered what kind of things you have to do to be loved like this. I don’t understand why this feeling is coming up inside me. It shouldn’t.

I’ve started noticing these small things recently. We stopped having tea because she got bored of it, and I respect that because in any relationship both people should be interested in pursuing things. But I’ve started missing those genuine and deep talks. I miss the old things we used to do, but I cannot pursue them now because circumstances have changed. I can’t keep asking her out for tea alone because the lessons about boundaries I’ve learned don’t allow me to do that. I miss every beautiful thing we used to do. I don’t love her, nor do I lust after her, but I just miss something.

I don’t want to feel all these things. I’m trying very hard not to acknowledge them, but I just can’t. The beautiful thing I once pursued as a boon has now become a bane to my existence.
I started my life pretty low. A dysfunctional family and financial struggles were part of everyday life, and like everyone else, the idea of improving yourself and becoming better was sold to me. I’m rich now, but it’s lonely. If you’ve watched the movie Rockstar, there is a scene where Khatara Bhai asks JJ, ""Ye kya banta ja raha hai, kya ho gaya hai tujhe JJ,"" and JJ answers, ""Mujhe bhi nahi pata main aisa kyu ho raha hoon. Mujhe ye sab hi chahiye tha na, paisa, fame. Mujhe to khush hona chahiye. Phir main khush kyu nahi hoon?"" Those lines are close to my heart. It burns inside every day and you cannot do anything.

Today when I dropped her home, her husband was waiting outside. When she saw him, she hugged him and her face lit up like a sunflower. I don’t intend to disturb her beautiful world at any cost. But I feel pity for myself. I talked to her husband once and he casually mentioned how lucky I am that I’m well settled financially and can do anything I want. But today I felt he is lucky, and I was a beggar in front of him. My whole life felt worthless and for a moment I felt like I was zero.

I don’t even know why I’m writing and posting this. Maybe if anyone has gone through something similar and come out of it, please share your advice.

tl;dr

Formed a deep emotional connection with a friend years ago, and although they are happily married, i miss the meaningful talks and closeness once I shared. Seeing them loving their husband made me feel lonely and question my own life. I don’t want to interfere in their life, but I am struggling with the emptiness and loss that resurfaced.",7,1763232985.0,MidTwentiesIndia,4,0.89,False

1oxzpk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1oxzpk2/why_do_people_use_euphemisms_regarding_sex_around/,Why do people use euphemisms regarding sex around other adults?,"Disclaimer: I am asexual and autistic if autism matters.

I was watching a comedy sketch from the YouTube channel Cracker Milk titled ""Want to come in for a coffee?""

In the sketch, a woman was trying to get a man she was on a date with to come into her house to have sex with her, but instead of directly telling him she wanted to have sex with him, she kept using euphemisms. Like ""Would you like to pet my cat?"", ""My bed is squeaky.,"" or ""We could have a coffee or alcohol?""

The man didn't get any of them and was telling her why he couldn't go into her house.

She could have avoided all of that by just telling him ""Hey, I'd like to have sex with you, are you interested?""

I know it's just a sketch, but it happens in real life.

Why do people do that?

I thought sex was supposed to be natural. I know that a lot of people have sex, so why do a lot of people like this?

Is it because of society? Is it because they think sex is an awkward word? Is it because they fear rejection? 

What's wrong with telling someone you want to have sex with them directly? ",0,1763232906.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,0.5,False

I recently got a drip coffee machine (image below), filter paper, medium ground coffee from Nomad. While the taste is a lot better than instant coffee that I used to have but I still think something's missing. I can't really get to the notes of it. The reason I say it, I tried the same coffee at Nomad's store and it tasted different but when I brew it at home, it's meh.

1oxzj9a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxzj9a,Living with a 20 year old toddler,"A couple years ago, a friend (21F - blue) of mine (23M) and I were talking about getting an apartment together and about 6 months ago, we officially moved into our place. The problem? She also moved in her other friend (20F - red) who is absolutely disgusting (in more ways than one) and acts like a child. At first I was a bit apprehensive about living with her because I had seen her bedroom at her parents’ house and knew how nasty she is, but I didn’t have anything against her at the time and had enjoyed her company for the most part the few times I had spent time with her and Blue together so I decided it would probably be fine.

For starters, her room is still atrocious. To her credit, she mostly keeps the mess to her personal space but I’m talking dirty dishes, trash, and old food **covering** her bed and floor (see last pic). She isn’t the best at cleaning shared spaces either and I’m pretty sure she’s straight up lied about having done her chores (during an argument where I had called her messy, she said “if you’re talking about the stove, I’m deep cleaning the kitchen tonight” but told Blue she had done it the prior morning).

I’ve heard her and our other roommate yelling at each other twice now. Once was because Blue didn’t do her dishes within 24 hours (we had agreed on a one-day rule prior to moving in but none of us are perfect about it. Red is the worst in the house and Blue is the best about that timeline) and the other was because “we should all be paying rent together” (Blue texted our landlord on a Friday night asking about rent drop off and our landlord (green in the texts) didn’t respond until the next morning when he said “be there in 30”. Blue immediately texted the roommate group chat to let us know but Red didn’t see it because her phone was off). Most of the conversations I’ve tried to have with her have been over text and every single time, she reads it all as rude and goes off on me despite me telling her multiple times it’s not meant to be like that and trying my best as far as word choice goes to not be a dick. When I’ve tried to talk to her in person, she constantly interrupts, making it very difficult to get any point across. Blue and I have had a few similar conversations about things we’d like to see change around the house with no yelling or interrupting, just an “ok” and improvement where we want to see it.

The whole rent argument with them happened right around Halloween and I was lucky enough to be a room over listening to it. At one point, Red had said something along the lines of “I’m sorry if it came off that way” (rude as hell, mind you) because Blue had expressed she was upset about the way Red was speaking to her over something that truly does not matter. I chimed in with “That’s a bullshit apology” which then led to her turning on me and crying about how “she shouldn’t have to apologize” and “ok well I just won’t say anything then” (please don’t omg). Later that night we had a friend over (who doesn’t talk to Red at all but is friends with me and Blue) and Red had asked me why I moved my dishes from the left side of the sink to the right. I gave her my answer (was cleaning my bong. Needed to clean the sink itself afterwards) and asked if it really mattered. She told me the right side of the sink was clean before I did that, but when I had gotten to the sink, **both** sides had a few dirty dishes in them. I didn’t want to deal with it, especially with a guest, so I just said ok and went to my room. After I closed the door, Red yelled “Ok great talk!” sarcastically. I ignored that too, but had to walk past her again when I went into the kitchen to grab something and she started up again with the “great talk” so I asked her what else she had to say. The answer was clearly nothing, because she shrugged then stumbled over her words before saying the same thing she already had about being clean. This turned into a whole thing with her asking me what’s so bad about her as a roommate so I started giving her my list and after about the 800th time being interrupted, I kind of lost my cool and yelled at her to shut up. Eventually I just left and went into my room because it was clear she wasn’t going to stop interrupting, we were getting nowhere (every point I made was “too vague”), and it was just pissing me off and I didn’t want to go off on her any more than I already had. 

I talked to Blue about the whole thing and initially was saying I wanted to try to actually talk it out, but we couldn’t figure out a great time to all talk in person so I ended up texting the group chat. The first 6 screenshots are that conversation. Since then, both Blue and I have been almost entirely ignoring her in the group chat. 

In talking to Blue the couple days after Halloween, I also found out Red has been going and whining to Blue about a bunch of little problems (mostly my dishes not being washed within 24 hours) instead of talking to me directly like a normal adult. She has accused me of multiple things I haven’t done, most notably not replacing the toilet paper in “her and Blue’s” bathroom (not theirs. They’re the only ones that clean it because I clean the second bathroom every week but it was very explicitly stated prior to moving in that it doesn’t matter what bathroom we use). Apparently, she also tried to get Blue to find a third roommate and sign the lease to kick me out behind my back, but when I said “I’m not moving out” in that text, she called me entitled for it. Finding out that part is what really shifted my thoughts from “let’s talk it out” to “I think you should just leave”. 


Fast forward to a couple days ago, Blue and I agreed to switch our bowl cabinet and our tea/coffee cabinet because we own like 10 bowls total and a crap ton of tea and coffee. Red apparently did not like this, because I found her bowls taking up the spot my plates belong in. I took them out so I could put my plates away and put them on the counter because I didn’t know where she’d want them, but it needed to not be there. Initially I thought she just didn’t want them on the top shelf (she’s 5’10” so that shouldn’t be an issue) but she put them on the top shelf of the other cabinet after I asked her to move them out of my plate spot, so I truly just think she’s trying to be difficult on purpose but I digress. The rest of the screenshots are from that. Now, I completely get being upset coming out to the kitchen and seeing your bowls have been taken out and put on the counter. That’s why I actually answered that text; I recognize that I do owe her a bit of a clarity on that one. This is also like the fifth time she’s jumped straight to accusations/being rude/etc. and we’ve talked about better ways to approach things like this multiple times. 

Since we’ve moved in, Red has really shown some true colors. She’s constantly making little comments to put other people down and she talks shit about everyone all of the time. It’ll be people she barely knows and/or do not deserve her crap in any way. She also hates all of Blue’s other friends and her boyfriend for no reason. Blue is kind of her only real friend, so anytime someone else starts getting close, Red feels threatened and starts getting jealous. It overall led to me not liking her and purposefully trying to limit my interactions with her shortly after moving in. I just can’t with all the negativity all the time.

On top of all of this, she’s also been stalking me in my own home. She went to Blue talking about “OP’s dishes have been in the sink for 38 hours!!” like are you setting a timer? Her dishes sit for 2+ days on the regular, too, so I don’t know what room she thinks she has to talk. And when she was accusing me of not replacing the toilet paper she had said something along the lines of “OP uses our bathroom all the time. I have proof.” What the hell do you mean you have proof of my bathroom habits? 

She’s moving out in six months, but I truly do not know how I’m gunna make it that long. I’m at the point where I want to go to our landlord and have her evicted early for being such a slob, but 1. I really don’t wanna stoop that low. I just want to be left alone for the next six months and then I want her out of my fucking life and 2. her and Blue have been very close friends for over a decade and I don’t want Blue to be put in any kind of weird/uncomfortable position. Plus, the weirdo followed me to my place of employment a year and a half after I started there so I have to deal with her there, too.

1oxzhke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawfinance/comments/1oxzhke/title_the_most_surprisingly_easy_ways_ive_found/,Title: The Most Surprisingly Easy Ways I’ve Found to Save Money Without Feeling Miserable,"So I’ve spent years trying to “budget,” and it always felt like punishment. Track every penny, sacrifice everything I enjoy, feel guilty for buying a coffee — nope. I’d always quit.



Then I accidentally stumbled into a few weirdly effective ways to save money without feeling like I was living in misery, and honestly they’ve changed my finances more than any spreadsheet ever did.



1. I started “delaying purchases” by 48 hours instead of banning them.

Turns out most of my impulse buys didn’t survive the 2-day test. I still buy things I actually want — but I’m saving \~30–40% of my usual spending because most impulses vanish.



2. I added a “decoy” bill.

I made a fake $50/month “bill” and auto-transferred it into a savings account on payday. Since it feels like a normal expense, I don’t miss it. This trick alone funded a $600 emergency cushion in a year.



3. I made one rule: “Upgrade later.”

Instead of buying something expensive right away, I get the cheaper version first.

If I still love it or use it constantly, then I upgrade.

If not… saved money.



4. I switched from ‘plan every dollar’ to ‘limit categories that explode.’

I stopped micromanaging everything and instead capped the big offenders: food delivery, random online shopping, and subscriptions.

Cutting just those three made my budget feel 10× easier.



5. I set a ‘fun fund’ so I never feel deprived.

$20–40/month for guilt-free treats.

Ironically, having a small amount for fun makes me spend less overall because I don’t hit the “screw it, I’m tired of saving” stage.



6. I replaced expensive habits with similar cheap ones.

I didn’t quit hobbies — I swapped versions:

• café→home latte setup

• bar night→house hangouts

• buying books→library + used books

Feels almost the same, costs way less.



The wild part: I’m saving more now than when I tried to “be strict.”

1oxzfak,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1oxzfak/first_shot/,First Shot.,"Got my Tirz from Refills.com. I just took my first dose yesterday morning at around 11am 28 units. I had some eggs for breakfast and half a bagel right after my first dose. At around 4pm I had some coffee with protein milk. For dinner at around 7pm I had 2 slices of pizza with different meat toppings and a cheese stick.

I don’t feel anything at all. I woke up this morning and wasn’t hungry but that’s normal for me, I usually never eat breakfast or anything until 1pm. I decided to have some eggs and half a toast again at 11am. I’ve been fasting for the past 3 months from 6pm until 1pm the next day. I do this Monday-Saturday. I have decided to stop fasting while I’m on Tirz.

I was so scared that I would get some type of side effect from the first dose the first day and that’s why I had breakfast right after the first dose. 

Anyways just wanted to update here in case anyone is wondering what happens right after their first dose. It’s 1pm right now so it’s been about 26 hours after my first dose and I feel perfectly fine. No side effects at all. Hoping it stays like this.

I have been drinking a lot of water which I always do and also drink electrolyte water throughout the day.

It’s my second day of periods and everything just feels a little heavier. I haven’t really eaten, and then I saw a post where a girl’s boyfriend brought her chocolates and gifts because she was on her periods. I’m genuinely happy for her, but it still made something in me sink a little.

I think I just miss being cared for in small, ordinary ways. I don’t even remember the last time I got a gift, or when someone called just to check on me, or brought me my favorite coffee because they thought of me. Those tiny things that make you feel like you matter to someone.

It’s been lonely in a quiet kind of way.

And then my exam results came today and they weren’t good, which just added to everything I was already carrying. I can’t cry in front of my family, so I’m just sitting in my room trying to keep it together while my chest feels tight and the tears keep coming.

I don’t know even know why I'm writing this tbh.

There’s a small office where I could go to work from, 150km from home, or 1:15h aprox commuting with train.

I feel guilty like he must be so bored and sad now.","So just what the title asks. For some context: about a year ago, the friendly stray who lived in my alley moved himself into my home. He had shown some interest for awhile, but my big (very friendly, but big) german shepherd would scare him off. Well, about a week after my pup passed, I was on the porch having coffee when this guy jumped into my lap out of nowhere, purring up a storm. Followed me inside like he owned the place. He obviously has had a home/people at some point in his life (very friendly and human-socialized), but has been living on the streets for at least 3-4 years.

It took some time but he settled into his new home pretty easily and I have loved having him around. After a few months he would spend msot of his time inside, but still INSISTED on going outside at least 1-2 times a day (would dart between legs from out of nowhere when I'd open doors, etc).

Well, in the past few months I had to pack up and move long-distance. I took him with me, and made the decision to ""convert"" him to a fully inside cat (mostly to minimize the risk of him getting lost or trying to run back ""home""). It's been pretty easy so far. It was at least a month or more before he really even expressed any interest in going outside... I think he was just getting used to his new surroundings and such. but recently he's started to get insistent about it again. I've managed to keep him inside, but he spends a lot of time miaowing plaintively at the door; he sounds so sad. And I know he had several other alley-cat friends at our old place (I would see them playing in the yard sometimes). So I wonder now if he's completely bored now with nobody to play with? I do what I can, but he really likes play-fighting. And even when he tries not to use his claws, and doesn;t bite hard at all, i get scratches and bruises lol.

So what are some things I can do to get him used to be an inside-guy? Toys to entertain him? any sort of exercise/activity things for him to do? I got him some of those ball-in-a-track toys, and he seems to like swatting those around sometimes. He LOVES playing with the feather-on-a-stick thing, but need something he can ""play"" with himself when I can't.

  
EDIT: For the road trip/move I DID get him a harness (Kitty Holster brand) to minimize risk of him escaping in a hotel parking lot or something. I worked gradually with treats and such to acclimate him to it, following some guides. He has no problems with me putting it on him, and after a few minutes will even start to walk around with it on a little. But thats about it. He really just likes to hunker down when its on. I tried taking him outside with it on (And him leashed) and despite having jsut been screaming to go outside, he jsut sat there on the porch hunkered down, seemingly a bit anxious, and ran back inside as soon as the door opened. So I don;t think getting him used to going outside on a harness or for walks is in the cards?

Also they are putting new lazy highers in easier places and moving the experienced people who have been there for years out and place them in more difficult harder places. Picture you being in a work area for so long that one day you are told they are training someone for your spot even though you have been there for a long time they want to take you out and place some new higher in your spot because they think it's easier for the new hires and that you'll be placed somewhere that's much more difficult. That's not equal opportunity that's discrimination and deserves a lawsuit. Also there is a lot of favoritism at that company. So if you are not one of the higher ups favorite expect to be treated like shit. They are also sexist by placing females in easier spots like testing the machines or something that doesn't require them to do a whole lot and if they are a female that looks like a model oh you can expect them to be treated better. What used to be a two person spot they have cut down to one making those spots much more harder and difficult for just one person to do alone and if you have to stop what they call the line you'll have your ass handed to you verbally. That's against the law. You cannot treat your employees like that. You cannot verbally assault, abuse or attack your employees.the company also has a lot of osha violations which for some reason they seem to keep getting away with and if management fucks up and the employees have to miss a day or has to reduce build because again management fucked up the employees have to pay the price and make up for it by working one of their weekends away. The company only cares about their money and not one thought is ever about their mistreated and abused employees. You'll hear a lot of shit talking about the company and how things are run from their employees on a regular basis. No one that works at that company likes working their and no one stays because they want to but because they have to. Everyone that works at that company has given their all but the company doesn't even bother to give a little back. I have heard so much bad things about that company and know a few people that have worked their and have talked to people that work their and it is worse they any horror movie. What bobcat should do is stop treating their employees as if their disposable give them more leniency on having to call out because hey people are human people have shit that happens but when it's you higher up lazy asses that have to miss a day of work you can take all the time you need without any consequences. Also give the employees that work 10 hours shift more sick time to make up for the damn difference. One shift works 8 hour shifts getting four hours of sick time a month so it takes them two months for one day and four months for two days but the shifts that works 10 hours get four hours of sick time a month meaning they need three months of sick time for one night and five months in order to be able to call out for two nights thats fucking stupid you dumb bastards. They have a if you are late by even one minute and you don't call and say hey I need to use sick time because I'm gonna be late you'll get an occurrence. That company is the worst company to ever work for and should be avoided. They need to give their employees a little more time off for being over worked and treated like shit and be able to spend time to rest and have time with their family, loved ones and friends. Everyone that has worked at bobcat for years seems to go crazy because of the emotional distress they have been placed under. People that have said when they went to the doctors because of pain that the doctors even have said we get a lot of bobcat employees in here. What is that tell you?

1oxz60l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oxz60l/aitah_for_making_my_coworker_uncomfortable/,AITAH for making my coworker uncomfortable?,"When I \[19F\] was still in high school, I started working at an oil change/quick service shop where I became great friends with one of the technicians there, let's name him Alex \[21M\] for privacy reasons. We would talk and joke together frequently and got along great. We never hung out outside of work because Alex was a major homebody, and even his other friends could never get him to come hang out so I didn't mind, and I even joked about it with Alex about how I'd get him out of his house one of these days. He'd gotten to be a close friend despite that we didn't see each other outside of work.

About a year after working there, I switched positions for that company and moved locations to one of the dealerships they owned, doing IT work. I felt fine at my new position but still missed Alex since I only saw him on the rare occasion I was troubleshooting at that location.

Once, my sister and I were drinking and I called up Alex to tell him that I loved him and ask if he would go to a fancy restaurant with me, I would pay for his meal, give him $100, and let him do burnouts in my car. (If you could see the car, I don't think you would've turned down that offer. . . hahaha). He sounded very amused and told me that he would go with me.

I texted him a few days later to let him know I remembered what I said and that if he wanted to go, I would be ready whenever. He read the message and didn't respond. He isn't big on texting so I continued on my merry way.

A couple months later, I heard through the grapevine that Alex was transferring to this dealership as well to do higher-level technician work. I was excited because now I knew where to find him and I could talk to him and see him again. I went into the shop one day and found him and it felt just like it had before, with us talking and laughing about various topics. I started to visit him once or twice a week to say hello.

It wasn't long before my boss called me into her office and told me that they didn't want me going into the shop anymore. She politely let me know that the owners regularly checked the security cameras and that she figured it would be better if I stayed in other areas in order to look productive. I apologized and agreed to it, thinking nothing of it.

I still thought regularly about Alex though. I remembered his favorite coffee order so I would occasionally leave my house early to pick it up for him and leave it with the service advisors to give him when he got there. He would thank me over text for it every time.

I mentioned him frequently to my girl friends who worked in the office with me. They got a kick out of it and they liked that I had someone to be excited about. One day when they were about to order coffees for themselves on doordash, I passively requested Alex's order from them as well, to pay them back for on CashApp or whatever. They exchanged a glance and one of them said that didn't seem like the best idea, shrugging it off by saying, ""you shouldn't put effort into someone who doesn't do the same for you."" And I pushed a little bit because I never minded if I got anything in return, and Alex wasn't really the type to get people gifts.

They continued to say I shouldn't and I finally asked them why they were acting like they knew something I didn't. They had never met Alex because the technicians are never in the area where we work, so I knew he hadn't said anything to them. They talked between themselves, trying to piece together ""whether I knew or not"" and after pleading with them to tell me whatever it was (I was certain I didn't know) they pulled me to a quiet area and told me.

Apparently, Alex had gone to both my boss and the other manager of the dealership on separate occasions to tell them I was making him uncomfortable, and buying him coffees he didn't want. That was also why, months ago, my boss had told me that I shouldn't go into the garage area. My coworkers found that out from a decent-sized chain of he-saids-she-saids, which I had somehow missed out on.

I got upset and teared up because no one had told me that Alex felt that way. He had certainly never told me, and my boss didn't tell me the real reason in order to save my feelings. I was definitely hurt, and I feel guilty for making Alex uncomfortable by forcing him to accept gifts and to see me when he didn't want to.

I'm sure it was a mistake to call him that night and tell him what I told him, but I knew him well enough to know that he didn't take any of those things to heart, or so I thought. Our relationship was pretty much a shorthand, and just full of jokes.

I feel disgusted by my own actions because even though there was a period for several months in the end where me and Alex didn't speak anymore, I didn't forget about him and I figured one day it would be different and maybe his schedule would clear up and he'd answer my text. That clearly won't ever happen because he had me blocked, I found out. He intended to never see or hear from me again.

While I'm mostly upset with myself for it, and I feel horribly guilty, I am also upset at my boss for trying not to hurt my feelings or humiliate me. I really think that feelings shouldn't be spared in the case of someone being uncomfortable, and I wish they had been more firm with me in order to take Alex's complaints seriously.

I get that I was wrong and that I failed to see some social cues that would've told me exactly what I found out in the end. Don't think I don't regret doing the things I did. I have a terrible sick feeling in my gut still, days after learning this. Was I was being an asshole when I continued to poke and prod at Alex by buying him coffee and hoping that he'd reach back out one day? Edit: I am considering going to my boss to tell her that she should take complaints like that more seriously as well.",2,1763231612.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I did a bit of guesswork for the mineral proportions (I tend to like more calcium than magnesium, and more sodium than potassium) and came up with this recipe (see pics).

To me, it’s that perfect balance of sweet and juicy, with a nice bright acidity.

i just want to start off by saying we met at university in march , me 20F (at the time) and him 21M (at the time).  i wasn’t interested at the time and he tried again in may where we spoke for about a month before we bumped into some problems. we recently reconnected as he wanted another chance.

the problems :
- we had slight religious differences (we spoke it out and are actually not too different)
- he lacked empathy in the beginning / was emotionally manipulative, lied to me a few times
- said some mean things to me (which he apologised for and explained) 

the problem ; we've been talking about our next meet however he did something that kind of has made me feel weird , he mentioned a pottery class a few days ago and asked me today to send him the link , then he said 'it's 110 for both of us' . he has money and isn’t in a situation that is necessarily hard for him which is making me feel as though he just doesn't want to spend on me? 

he has designer such as loro, he has a gle and manages properties so i don't understand . we were together on wednesday in central & my feet were sore due to my ballet flats and he mentioned ‘we will get you some shoes today’ which he didn’t follow through on .  i have financial anxiety because of my mother always speaking and mentioning finances;  i don't want that in a partner and him doing that has given me anxiety

with our meetings such as coffee and dinner he has paid

i am the eldest daughter and i provide myself with anything as i believe i deserve it : for reference we both come from a middle eastern background. i’ve always been the one to manage my family dynamics , help with finances , and carry responsibly at a very young age ,in this situation it isn’t so much about the money but more about not following through things and once again he is not someone that lacks the funds but it feels as though he just doesn’t want to spend on me or follow through on his words ? he is the only child for reference 

thing is if i'm with a guy and he says something is nice or would suit me, id expect him to buy it for me if it makes sense it's kind of embarrassing paying for my own things if im with a guy especially if ive technically known him since march (when we had our first conversation) is it my own fault for having high(er) expectations ? 

he's been talking about opening a cafe but you can't pay for pottery class, or a gift? the other day we were walking past a flower shop and he asked me if i wanted flowers but i awkwardly laughed as that isn't something you ask a girl you just do it

i also feel as though i could be put in a position that i can’t do things or have experiences because the guy doesn’t want to spend a certain amount of money , i would do it with my friends but in my culture we believe the man does cover these things due to him wanting to spend time with you 

if i'm going to go 5050 i might as well stay alone , as an eldest daughter i need someone that makes my life easy in all aspects or else it's not worth the hassle and stress

i do like this guy or else i wouldn’t have gave him a chance , but i do believe a bad trait is stinginess especially if you do have the funds , i would be understanding if he didn’t ",1,1763231449.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

If he had his phone, he could at least let us know, but most of the time he doesn’t. I was thinking of getting him an Apple Watch so he’d have some way to contacting us, or we’d have some way of contacting him, if he decides he has to go do something random while out. At least with a watch, I could make sure he’s wearing it.

Hi there internet stranger!

I’m hoping to meet a fellow dumbass who’s into dumbassery just as much as I am .ideally someone who enjoys texting about everything, nothing and the chaotic nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we’d click :
I’m 21 years old I have ADHD (translation: I develop a new hyperfixation every other week ). I enjoy reading (currently on Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking, and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then proceed to listen to none of them and save them on my iPod because apparently I’m a digital hoarder.

Not a movie girlie but I do love watching series now and then (currently binging Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like cafés, drinking too much coffee or tea, doing online crosswords, falling into YouTube rabbit holes, and reading random Wikipedia pages .I speak three languages and I’m slowly learning a fourth. I’m open to talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click .

Some things to expect if we become friends 
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations 
• Someone you can annoy at any hour
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Branches slapped against my arms as I ran, heart hammering, lungs burning.

Behind me, I could hear it—something big moving fast.
When I looked over my shoulder, I saw it: a massive shadow darting between the trees, yellow eyes glowing like headlights.

A wolf.
At least, that’s what my brain told me it was.

I ran harder, but my foot caught on a root. I went down face-first into the cold dirt.
By the time I rolled over, the beast was already on top of me—

—and then I woke up.

Cold sweat.
Dark room.
The same nightmare.

I sat up, wiping my face and staring at the ceiling.
“Will these dreams ever stop?” I muttered to no one.
Knowing my luck… probably not.

I dragged myself into the bathroom.
The mirror didn’t do me any favors—pale skin, black curly hair sticking out everywhere, and the dark circles under my eyes looked worse than ever.

After getting dressed in my school uniform, I caught my own reflection again.
Yeah, I know what you’re probably thinking.

“This guy’s a student?”

Nope.
I’m a high school teacher.
A tired, underpaid, over-caffeinated high school teacher in upstate New York.

And I’m running on maybe three hours of sleep.

The drive to school was slow. Snow blanketed the streets, the kind that made your tires slide even when you were going twenty under the limit.

When I finally pulled into the parking lot, I spotted someone waving.

“Good morning, Mr. Jack!” Susie called out, walking up to me with that grin of his. “Still not getting much sleep, huh?”

I laughed awkwardly, rubbing the back of my neck.
“Yeah, you could say that.”

Susie’s one of the first people who gave me a chance here. Blonde hair, soft round eyes, dimples that make him look way too kind. The makeup helps that illusion, too.

I’ll admit—the first time I met him, I thought he was a girl.
Found out the hard way in the restroom.

“Don’t look at me like that,” I told him. “It’s just been hard lately. My mom didn’t train me for nothing.”

The words slipped out before I could stop them.
Susie frowned but didn’t say anything. Luckily, the bell rang, saving me from explaining myself.

Class went as usual—until it didn’t.

I was handing out history books when I noticed something strange.
There was one more student than normal.

At first, I thought maybe I’d just miscounted. But then I saw her.

Short bob-cut hair, deep brown.
Her breathing was… odd. Raspy, almost like a wheeze.
And when she looked up at me, I swear her tongue flicked out—
forked, like a snake’s.

I caught a glimpse of something else too.
Scales. Faint, but there. Around her neck and forearms.

I cleared my throat.
“Sorry, miss. Mind telling me your name? I don’t remember seeing you in class before.”

She pulled her scarf up a little, voice quiet.
“I’m Annabelle, sir. My mom and I just moved here. We’re… not used to the cold yet.”

I sighed. Another new student, more paperwork, more meetings.
And of course, no raise.

“I get that,” I said. “But I’ll need to talk with you and your mother soon. You’ve missed a lot of material.”

Truthfully, I wanted to help her—but I also knew better.
Whenever there’s one monster, there’s always more.

As the class went on, I noticed Annabelle’s eyes wandering.
She wasn’t paying attention to the lesson. She was watching her classmates.
Like they were prey.

When she started to lean toward a boy in the back, her mouth opening wider than it should’ve, I slammed my hand on the desk.

The sound echoed through the room like a gunshot.

“All right, class,” I said, forcing a smile, “we’re ending early today. Grab your things.”

As everyone packed up, I added, “Annabelle, stay for a minute.”

The room emptied. Silence settled.
I called her mother right away.

It took forty minutes before she showed up.
She walked in calmly, closing the door behind her.

Her hair was deep brown with a faint orange tint, tied up in a neat bun. She looked perfectly normal—until she heard my last name.

Her face changed.

Her lower half began to shimmer, shifting, scales replacing skin.
That’s when I realized what I was dealing with.

A Naga.

Half-human, half-snake. Shapeshifters. Dangerous.

She hissed and lunged. I barely dodged, and she crashed into the wall hard enough to leave a dent—there went part of my paycheck.

She came again, fangs bared.
I caught her by the neck, holding her back as she struggled, her venomous teeth inches from my face.

Then—voices. Footsteps in the hall.

We both froze.

Slowly, she shifted back, panting.
“I don’t know what a hunter like you is doing here,” she said quietly, “but my daughter and I haven’t hurt anyone. We just came here to live… with her father.”

I looked at her like she was insane. There was no way a monster didn’t hurt someone. I should have gone in hard—done what hunters do—but I didn’t. I went against what they were.

I rubbed my forehead softly. Three hours of sleep. My head throbbed. “Let’s say I believe you—say you’re some friendly monster just trying to live with her husband or whatever he is. Why put a monster child in a school of humans? Doesn’t that seem irresponsible? Dangerous for any of the kids?” The thought of some snot-nosed brat getting hurt made my blood boil.

She stared at me like I’d grown a second head, like she expected me to finish them both off then and there. Maybe that was a safe assumption. I had planned on it. Change of plans, I guess… for now.

“Do you really think there are schools for monsters?” she said. “It’s not like we can build our own buildings just for our species. That’s why we shifters learned to blend in. I would’ve expected hunters studying us for hundreds of years to know that. But I guess I expected too much from humans.” The last part came out with a hiss—poison in the voice, literal or not.

“All right, fine, you make a fair point,” I said. “But your daughter did try eating another kid. I can’t just let that slide. I can’t take you both out here where anyone can see, and I can’t let her eat the other students.”

The two of them looked nervous. The mother—August, I’d learn—was a very serious woman and a mother who would bite someone's head off literally.

I thought for a long second, looking at both of them. “…So how about this: I’ll tutor your daughter. Teach her how to behave around humans. How to blend.” My voice hardened. “I’m not thrilled about it. If either of you causes trouble, I will not hesitate.”

I went to my desk and took a sip of black coffee. If the other hunters found out I was sparing them—if they knew I hadn’t dealt with them—my head would be on a pike. That thought was always close. Hunters run in the family; it’s in the blood. You don’t get out of it. I’d been told that since I was a kid. The Hemmings name carries weight—old scars, older promises. Some nights that legacy sits heavy behind my teeth. I didn’t say that aloud.

August hesitated, then nodded. “Fine. Teach her only what she needs. Don’t fill her head with lies that monsters must be destroyed because of what we are.”

I almost barked at her—there are reasons hunters do what they do—but the bell for the next class was ringing and we couldn’t keep going. I adjusted my tie and forced my face back into the mask.

“Fine. I promise not to teach anything hunter-related. Only what she needs for school.”

I mentally cataloged what else I had to do. Nightwork. That was the word I used at home: investigating, watching, making sure there weren’t more hiding in plain sight. I had a job to do after dark. That was when the real teeth of the world showed.

I tried to cover the dent in the wall with some paint from the supply closet and walked them both out to the door. I closed it behind them and sat back at my desk. I closed my eyes for a beat and let the silence in.

There were a lot of unsaid things—about August, about Annabelle, and about me. The agreement would buy them time. It would buy me something too: a way to watch, to learn, to prepare.

The hunters in my family would not have approved. They were the kind of people who kept lists, kept trophies, kept blood at the ready. They believed in endings. I had always believed in endings, too, but lately I kept feeling like I was straddling two sides of a knife. Sometimes the hair on my forearms would rise for no reason; sometimes my jaw ached as if I’d been running all night. I told myself it was stress. That was easier.

The door to the classroom stayed closed for a long time after they left. When I finally opened it, the hallway was empty and the dent in the wall looked less noticeable in the fluorescent light. I made a note in my planner: tutor Annabelle, meet mother, check dent repair cost, check night patrol routes.

I wrote the last line in the back of my head—this isn’t over. This was only the beginning.",5,1763231060.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Denver Nuggets vs. Minnesota Timberwolves: A Tale of Triple-Doubles, Ankle Sprains, and the Unlikely Heroism of Jamal Murray**

The Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves are set to collide in a battle of wills, wits, and wrist soreness. With the Timberwolves favored (-1.5) and the over/under at 234.5, this game promises drama, drama, and more drama. Let’s break it down with the precision of Nikola Jokic and the humor of a postgame interview with a sleep-deprived sportscaster.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

The Nuggets, riding a six-game winning streak, are statistically the team you invite to your basketball party—until you realize they’ve lost key pieces. Christian Braun (ankle) is out for six weeks, Cameron Johnson (arm) is a no-show, and Nikola Jokic (wrist) is listed as a “day-to-day” enigma. Jokic, the human Swiss Army knife of basketball, is averaging a triple-double (28.8 PPG, 13.1 RPG, 10.9 APG) and has six triple-doubles already. Without him? The Nuggets’ offense becomes a toaster in a bakery: present, but useless.

The Timberwolves, meanwhile, are healthier and riding Anthony Edwards’ hot hand. The “Greek Freak” of hype (okay, he’s not Giannis, but work with me) has averaged 29 PPG in his last five games, shooting 45% from three. Julius Randle, playing at a career-high level, is the team’s gravitational anchor, pulling in rebounds and points like a black hole with a taste for highlight reels. Minnesota’s defense, however, is a sieve—ranking 11th in points allowed (115.3 PPG). They’re the NBA’s version of a sieve that also sells coffee: porous but caffeinated.

---

### Injury News: The Plot Thickens

Denver’s injury report reads like a horror movie: \*Christian Braun’s ankle sprained so badly, it’s writing a memoir. Cameron Johnson’s arm is “uncomfortable,” which in NBA speak means he’s probably texting his trainer in Morse code. And Jokic? He’s “day-to-day,” which in NBA speak means he’ll probably play but will spend the game wincing at every jump shot like a parent watching their kid attempt a skateboard tri

She goes straight for the most dangerous stuff - electrical outlets, the stairs, our dog's food bowl. Yesterday I turned around for literally five seconds to grab my phone and she was halfway to the fireplace. We already baby-proofed the house - outlet covers, cabinet locks, gates on the stairs, the whole deal. But she still finds things to get into and I can't follow her around 24/7. I've decided to get a baby play pen but our budget is pretty tight since I'm on maternity leave, so I need to be smart about what we buy. I've been comparing different options online and the variety is overwhelming but I’ve narrowed it down to Graco, Summer Infant, and Baby Trend. Some basic mesh ones run about $60-80, then there's the Regalo My Play which is around $100, and those fancy North States Superyard systems that cost $150-200+. Even found some suppliers on Alibaba selling similar setups cheaper. I just want to clarify some things:

Which style actually works better for active babies - mesh kit, wooden panels, or plastic?

How long can I realistically use it before she outgrows it or figures out how to escape?

My daughter is super active and determined, so I need something that'll actually contain her safely while I do basic things like make coffee or fold laundry. She's not the type to sit quietly so I need something that'll keep her safe while I pee or make coffee without having to strap her in every time.

- i bottled 250ml (+1gr sugar) and 125ml (+0.5gr sugar) for 2F, just because there was some leftover
- made a 1L vessel with 650ml coffee (700ml water, 42 gr of coffee with V60 extraction, and 55gr of sugar), added the reserved 250ml starter and a pellicle half

i just want to start off by saying we met at university in march , me 20F (at the time) and him 21M (at the time).  i wasn’t interested at the time and he tried again in may where we spoke for about a month before we bumped into some problems. we recently reconnected as he wanted another chance.

the problems :
- we had slight religious differences (we spoke it out and are actually not too different)
- he lacked empathy in the beginning / was emotionally manipulative, lied to me a few times
- said some mean things to me (which he apologised for and explained) 

the problem ; we've been talking about our next meet however he did something that kind of has made me feel weird , he mentioned a pottery class a few days ago and asked me today to send him the link , then he said 'it's 110 for both of us' . he has money and isn’t in a situation that is necessarily hard for him which is making me feel as though he just doesn't want to spend on me? 

he has designer such as loro, he has a gle and manages properties so i don't understand . we were together on wednesday in central & my feet were sore due to my ballet flats and he mentioned ‘we will get you some shoes today’ which he didn’t follow through on .  i have financial anxiety because of my mother always speaking and mentioning finances;  i don't want that in a partner and him doing that has given me anxiety

with our meetings such as coffee and dinner he has paid

i am the eldest daughter and i provide myself with anything as i believe i deserve it : for reference we both come from a middle eastern background. i’ve always been the one to manage my family dynamics , help with finances , and carry responsibly at a very young age ,in this situation it isn’t so much about the money but more about not following through things and once again he is not someone that lacks the funds but it feels as though he just doesn’t want to spend on me or follow through on his words ? he is the only child for reference 

thing is if i'm with a guy and he says something is nice or would suit me, id expect him to buy it for me if it makes sense it's kind of embarrassing paying for my own things if im with a guy especially if ive technically known him since march (when we had our first conversation) is it my own fault for having high(er) expectations ? 

he's been talking about opening a cafe but you can't pay for pottery class, or a gift? the other day we were walking past a flower shop and he asked me if i wanted flowers but i awkwardly laughed as that isn't something you ask a girl you just do it

i also feel as though i could be put in a position that i can’t do things or have experiences because the guy doesn’t want to spend a certain amount of money , i would do it with my friends but in my culture we believe the man does cover these things due to him wanting to spend time with you 

if i'm going to go 5050 i might as well stay alone , as an eldest daughter i need someone that makes my life easy in all aspects or else it's not worth the hassle and stress

i do like this guy or else i wouldn’t have gave him a chance , but i do believe a bad trait is stinginess especially if you do have the funds , i would be understanding if he didn’t ",0,1763230875.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

The Oklahoma City Thunder (12-1) roll into Charlotte like a wrecking ball with a résumé, taking on the struggling Hornets (4-8) in a matchup that’s less “game” and more “lesson in humility.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (And Neither Do the Bookmakers)

The betting lines make this as clear as a post-game press conference with a mic drop. The Thunder are **-1600 favorites** on the moneyline, implying a **94.1% implied probability** of victory. For context, that’s the statistical certainty of a toaster burning bread. The Hornets, at **+900**, have a **10% chance**—about the same odds of me napping through this entire analysis and still getting paid. The spread? A staggering **-17.5 points**, suggesting bookmakers expect OKC to win by almost two dunks. The total is set at **224.5**, a number so high it could make even the most ardent Charlotte fan question their life choices.

Statistically, the Thunder’s 12-1 record (reigning champs, remember?) dwarfs Charlotte’s 4-8 slump. OKC’s four-game win streak includes a **30-point thrashing of the Lakers**, where Shai Gilgeous-Alexander played 27 minutes and looked bored. The Hornets, meanwhile, just lost **134-147 to Milwaukee** in OT, a game where they scored 58 points in the 4th quarter and still lost. Math: not their friend.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Fatigue, and a Side of “Why?”

The Thunder’s injury report reads like a medical textbook. **Jalen Williams** (wrist surgery), **Lu Dort** (questionable with an upper trap strain—yes, *that’s* a thing), **Aaron Wiggins** (adductor strain), and four others are out. It’s a surgical strike on their roster, but even with this “B-team,” they’re still the defending champs. Meanwhile, Charlotte’s lone confirmed absence is **Brandon Miller** (shoulder subluxation), though their “team-first” attitude probably means they’ll try to win wi

I asked her that if she showed me a red, yellow or orange rose than I would know it meant one thing and if I was showed a pink or white rose than I would know it meant another thing. So I've been praying my novena each day and I've seen many colored roses, red, white, yellow and pink ones but these were obviously just part of decoration and not a sign from St. Therese, but never any orange ones (I included orange in my prayers because it is semi significant to what I was asking of St. Therese). However, yesterday (the sixth day of my novena), I went to the library to study (I'm in college) and saw 2 of my friends studying at a table so I went to go join them. I then saw that an orange rose was on the table in a plastic coffee cup. This was out of the ordinary, you don't just see these on tables everyday. On the coffee cup was written, ""1 PS Chai Cecelia"". The PS probably meant Pumpkin Spice. I asked my friends where they got the rose from and they said that it was just there when they sat down. I didn't tell them about my novena but they joked that the rose turned orange because of the pumpkin spice, I don't think that could actually happen though. So now I've seen what I presume to be my sign and my heart is racing, I couldn't get any schoolwork finished. I thought that it was interesting that this sign was given to me on that day specifically because just the day before I relasped into pornography and masturbation for the first time in probably a month (a very long time for me). So I decided to head back to my dorm because I couldn't get any work done. On the way back to my dorm there is a Mary statue that I almost always pass. When I passed it this time there were 2 roses in the statue's left hand. One was red, the other was a pinkish-red. Now this confused me, because I asked St. Therese that if I was shown a red or pink rose that they would mean 2 different things. Maybe the fact that I saw both colored roses in out of the ordinary ways means that I will get what I am asking for, but it will not last? I'm not sure. So to wrap up, was my novena answered? I am having a hard time telling if it was or not? Thank you for any help. Deus Vult.

1oxyu6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oxyu6o/got_diagnosed_today/,Got diagnosed today,"Hi everyone, I had my adhd assessment today and was diagnosed with inattentive adhd. I was prescribed Xenidate XL 18mg for 2 weeks and then I’ll take 36mg until my review in 3 weeks time. I’ve grown up in a very anti medication household and I also have major health anxiety so when I read the side effects I freaked out. 

I feel stuck as I know that continuing on like I am isn’t an option so if this is going to help me then I want to be able to take it without thinking that I’ll be the 1 in 10,000 who has a heart attack. I also struggle with insomnia some nights anyway so I’m very worried about this. 

I don’t drink alcohol, I drink coffee but will happily switch to decaf and I eat relatively healthy. I have a family history of heart disease which I discussed with the psychiatrist so that scares me a little as it could cause heart palpitations, high blood pressure etc. 

As you can probably guess I have major anxiety anyway so I’m not sure if I’m the right candidate for meds. I guess the only way to find out is to try. 

I’m just looking for advice or your own personal stories of starting medication.

1oxyste,https://i.redd.it/sdwdyli3qg1g1.jpeg,How to Read Between the Beats: Understanding Your HRV Patterns,"Most of us walk around thinking we know how stressed we are. We don’t. At least, not until we hit the “why am I irritated at a cereal box?” phase.

But your body usually knows long before your mind catches up, and it leaves clues in one of the most underrated signals you’re already generating every second: **heart rate variability**, or HRV.

This post breaks down what HRV means, how to read its patterns on a daily basis, and why it’s one of the most reliable ways to understand stress and recovery, without turning it into another source of anxiety.

**What HRV Really Measures**

HRV is the variation in time between your heartbeats. Not the number of beats per minute but sort of *spacing* between them.

If your heartbeat looks like a metronome, that’s not ideal.

If it looks a little messy and adaptable, that’s good.

Why? Because variability means your nervous system is flexible. It can switch gears when life changes: meet a deadline, handle a tough conversation, eat something weird at a work event, whatever.

Low HRV usually means your system is stuck in “handle stuff now” mode.

High HRV means your system has room to breathe, literally and figuratively.

**The Part Nobody Tells You: HRV Changes Before You Feel Stressed**

One of the wildest things from research: HRV often shifts **before** you feel stressed.

Your body picks up the load early. Lack of sleep. Too much caffeine. A rushed morning. Tiny things stack up, and your HRV often dips long before your brain registers it. Think of HRV like your early-warning radar. Not dramatic. Not alarmist. Just quietly telling you, “Hey, today might hit harder than you expected.”

**Patterns That Matter (And What They Usually Mean)**

These aren’t rules, just common trends that show up again and again.

**1. A Steady Downward Drift**

Not catastrophic, but worth noticing. It can be a sign that you’re accumulating stress faster than you’re recovering.

**2. Big Morning Swings**

If your HRV is low immediately after waking, it often reflects sleep quality or late-night stress (looking at you, doomscrolling). If it rises later in the morning, your body is stabilizing. Good sign.

**3. Sharp Drop After Hard Workouts**

Totally normal. What matters is whether your HRV rebounds within a day or two. If not, you’re probably pushing too hard.

**4. Weekend Spikes**

Sometimes this means rest helped. Sometimes it means you drank less coffee or had fewer Slack notifications. Both count.

**How to Read HRV Without Getting Obsessed**

This is important: you’re not supposed to *optimize* HRV every day. You’re supposed to understand it. A weird number isn’t a failure. A great number isn’t a trophy. The real value is in the trend:

* What consistently lowers your HRV?
* What consistently improves it?
* What’s your personal baseline?
* How quickly do you bounce back?

Once you see the patterns, your daily choices start making a lot more sense.

**How Harvee Helps You Read the Signals (Without Overthinking Them)**

Harvee translates all this into something that’s actually usable:

* Daily body stress level so you know what’s happening behind the scenes
* Heat maps that highlight your most and least stressful hours
* HRV trends that show how your system adapts over time
* Recommendations that match your recovery level
* Sleep, activity, daylight, and lifestyle context all in the same place

The goal isn’t perfection.

It’s building body wisdom knowing what your signals mean so you can make decisions you won’t regret later.

**Why HRV Matters More Than We Think**

If you want to:

* avoid burnout
* understand your stress patterns
* improve recovery exercise smarter
* or just stop guessing how you actually feel

…then HRV is one of the most helpful markers you can track.

You don’t need to obsess over it. You just need to listen to what it’s trying to say.

Branches slapped against my arms as I ran, heart hammering, lungs burning.

Behind me, I could hear it—something big moving fast.
When I looked over my shoulder, I saw it: a massive shadow darting between the trees, yellow eyes glowing like headlights.

A wolf.
At least, that’s what my brain told me it was.

I ran harder, but my foot caught on a root. I went down face-first into the cold dirt.
By the time I rolled over, the beast was already on top of me—

—and then I woke up.

Cold sweat.
Dark room.
The same nightmare.

I sat up, wiping my face and staring at the ceiling.
“Will these dreams ever stop?” I muttered to no one.
Knowing my luck… probably not.

I dragged myself into the bathroom.
The mirror didn’t do me any favors—pale skin, black curly hair sticking out everywhere, and the dark circles under my eyes looked worse than ever.

After getting dressed in my school uniform, I caught my own reflection again.
Yeah, I know what you’re probably thinking.

“This guy’s a student?”

Nope.
I’m a high school teacher.
A tired, underpaid, over-caffeinated high school teacher in upstate New York.

And I’m running on maybe three hours of sleep.

The drive to school was slow. Snow blanketed the streets, the kind that made your tires slide even when you were going twenty under the limit.

When I finally pulled into the parking lot, I spotted someone waving.

“Good morning, Mr. Jack!” Susie called out, walking up to me with that grin of his. “Still not getting much sleep, huh?”

I laughed awkwardly, rubbing the back of my neck.
“Yeah, you could say that.”

Susie’s one of the first people who gave me a chance here. Blonde hair, soft round eyes, dimples that make him look way too kind. The makeup helps that illusion, too.

I’ll admit—the first time I met him, I thought he was a girl.
Found out the hard way in the restroom.

“Don’t look at me like that,” I told him. “It’s just been hard lately. My mom didn’t train me for nothing.”

The words slipped out before I could stop them.
Susie frowned but didn’t say anything. Luckily, the bell rang, saving me from explaining myself.

Class went as usual—until it didn’t.

I was handing out history books when I noticed something strange.
There was one more student than normal.

At first, I thought maybe I’d just miscounted. But then I saw her.

Short bob-cut hair, deep brown.
Her breathing was… odd. Raspy, almost like a wheeze.
And when she looked up at me, I swear her tongue flicked out—
forked, like a snake’s.

I caught a glimpse of something else too.
Scales. Faint, but there. Around her neck and forearms.

I cleared my throat.
“Sorry, miss. Mind telling me your name? I don’t remember seeing you in class before.”

She pulled her scarf up a little, voice quiet.
“I’m Annabelle, sir. My mom and I just moved here. We’re… not used to the cold yet.”

I sighed. Another new student, more paperwork, more meetings.
And of course, no raise.

“I get that,” I said. “But I’ll need to talk with you and your mother soon. You’ve missed a lot of material.”

Truthfully, I wanted to help her—but I also knew better.
Whenever there’s one monster, there’s always more.

As the class went on, I noticed Annabelle’s eyes wandering.
She wasn’t paying attention to the lesson. She was watching her classmates.
Like they were prey.

When she started to lean toward a boy in the back, her mouth opening wider than it should’ve, I slammed my hand on the desk.

The sound echoed through the room like a gunshot.

“All right, class,” I said, forcing a smile, “we’re ending early today. Grab your things.”

As everyone packed up, I added, “Annabelle, stay for a minute.”

The room emptied. Silence settled.
I called her mother right away.

It took forty minutes before she showed up.
She walked in calmly, closing the door behind her.

Her hair was deep brown with a faint orange tint, tied up in a neat bun. She looked perfectly normal—until she heard my last name.

Her face changed.

Her lower half began to shimmer, shifting, scales replacing skin.
That’s when I realized what I was dealing with.

A Naga.

Half-human, half-snake. Shapeshifters. Dangerous.

She hissed and lunged. I barely dodged, and she crashed into the wall hard enough to leave a dent—there went part of my paycheck.

She came again, fangs bared.
I caught her by the neck, holding her back as she struggled, her venomous teeth inches from my face.

Then—voices. Footsteps in the hall.

We both froze.

Slowly, she shifted back, panting.
“I don’t know what a hunter like you is doing here,” she said quietly, “but my daughter and I haven’t hurt anyone. We just came here to live… with her father.”

I looked at her like she was insane. There was no way a monster didn’t hurt someone. I should have gone in hard—done what hunters do—but I didn’t. I went against what they were.

I rubbed my forehead softly. Three hours of sleep. My head throbbed. “Let’s say I believe you—say you’re some friendly monster just trying to live with her husband or whatever he is. Why put a monster child in a school of humans? Doesn’t that seem irresponsible? Dangerous for any of the kids?” The thought of some snot-nosed brat getting hurt made my blood boil.

She stared at me like I’d grown a second head, like she expected me to finish them both off then and there. Maybe that was a safe assumption. I had planned on it. Change of plans, I guess… for now.

“Do you really think there are schools for monsters?” she said. “It’s not like we can build our own buildings just for our species. That’s why we shifters learned to blend in. I would’ve expected hunters studying us for hundreds of years to know that. But I guess I expected too much from humans.” The last part came out with a hiss—poison in the voice, literal or not.

“All right, fine, you make a fair point,” I said. “But your daughter did try eating another kid. I can’t just let that slide. I can’t take you both out here where anyone can see, and I can’t let her eat the other students.”

The two of them looked nervous. The mother—August, I’d learn—was a very serious woman and a mother who would bite someone's head off literally.

I thought for a long second, looking at both of them. “…So how about this: I’ll tutor your daughter. Teach her how to behave around humans. How to blend.” My voice hardened. “I’m not thrilled about it. If either of you causes trouble, I will not hesitate.”

I went to my desk and took a sip of black coffee. If the other hunters found out I was sparing them—if they knew I hadn’t dealt with them—my head would be on a pike. That thought was always close. Hunters run in the family; it’s in the blood. You don’t get out of it. I’d been told that since I was a kid. The Hemmings name carries weight—old scars, older promises. Some nights that legacy sits heavy behind my teeth. I didn’t say that aloud.

August hesitated, then nodded. “Fine. Teach her only what she needs. Don’t fill her head with lies that monsters must be destroyed because of what we are.”

I almost barked at her—there are reasons hunters do what they do—but the bell for the next class was ringing and we couldn’t keep going. I adjusted my tie and forced my face back into the mask.

“Fine. I promise not to teach anything hunter-related. Only what she needs for school.”

I mentally cataloged what else I had to do. Nightwork. That was the word I used at home: investigating, watching, making sure there weren’t more hiding in plain sight. I had a job to do after dark. That was when the real teeth of the world showed.

I tried to cover the dent in the wall with some paint from the supply closet and walked them both out to the door. I closed it behind them and sat back at my desk. I closed my eyes for a beat and let the silence in.

There were a lot of unsaid things—about August, about Annabelle, and about me. The agreement would buy them time. It would buy me something too: a way to watch, to learn, to prepare.

The hunters in my family would not have approved. They were the kind of people who kept lists, kept trophies, kept blood at the ready. They believed in endings. I had always believed in endings, too, but lately I kept feeling like I was straddling two sides of a knife. Sometimes the hair on my forearms would rise for no reason; sometimes my jaw ached as if I’d been running all night. I told myself it was stress. That was easier.

The door to the classroom stayed closed for a long time after they left. When I finally opened it, the hallway was empty and the dent in the wall looked less noticeable in the fluorescent light. I made a note in my planner: tutor Annabelle, meet mother, check dent repair cost, check night patrol routes.

I wrote the last line in the back of my head—this isn’t over. This was only the beginning.",1,1763230634.0,TheHemmingsUniverse,0,1.0,False

Café competition drama,"Problem/Goal: I really do not know if this is the right platform to post this but I'm thinking there could be many business owners here that can give me insights on how to handle the situation.

Context: So just a few months ago, maybe around 6months, a new coffeeshop opened in our area. For the longest time, kami lang ang coffeeshop and nag stick sa area because prone to business closure talaga ang place namin dahil hindi heavy ang foot traffic and medyo mahina ang spending power ng mga taga area namin. We rely on tourist and events and social media presence to survive our business. When this new coffeeshop came, at first nag worry ako that our sales will be divided. After a few days I learned to surrender kay Lord ang mga bagay that is out of our control and focus on our shop, but then the unending drama started to unfold. I found out from different people (a lot) that this new coffee shop owner has been attacking us through many different ways. Her attacks are mostly personal, her target was our financial status and debts. She'd tell people about or life (mind you, we do not know her personally, she got these stories from people who also want to tear us down because we are DAYO) and would tell people, including their staff that we are ""kalaban"" and actually called us names that are really offending and below the belt. 

I tried to ignore a lot of red flags; her poaching our staff(s) offering higher rates (she didn't succeed), using our business name in their promotional postings as a ""landmark"", posting vague attacks on their fb page and our google business page has been shut down and one concerned citizen told us that they mass reported it when someone gave them a-1-star review and that very same reviewer gave us a 5-star-review so they assumed that it was us. Our google, reviews and photos were all gone just because of mass reporting, but thankfully, Google did a manual review and saw that we didn't fabricate anything yada yada yada. We got our page back. But she actually asked one of her staff to go to our place and take a video of our menu, and our operations, etc. And would make fun of us for any reason she would come up of. And manyyy more pang iinsulto. 

Now, I want to know how can I protect ourselves and our business from this person. A LOT of people warned us about this person as she also did the same to many businesses in different areas in our region. We ignored it as we do not want to meddle in any drama, until it happened to us too. Her family has money and always use this privilege of hers to say and do whatever she wants. I don't want to play her dirty games but I also don't want to lose the business we worked hard for. Baka may insights kayo as we will be confronting her soon. ",1,1763230628.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
1oxyqzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/techtheatre/comments/1oxyqzt/looking_for_mic_setup_suggestions_for_game_show/,Looking for mic setup suggestions for game show,"TL;DR: Good way to have three or four mics wirelessly go to XLR? Any hardware suggestions? The fewer XLR ports used, the better

So I host an independent game show called ""[Like My Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thzdz354q2w)"", and I like to travel with the podiums and work with whatever each venue has. It showcases players who have stage experience, but also people who are brand new, so some of them aren't so good at projecting their voice. It's nine players, three at a time on stage, plus myself.

In my dream world, I'd put a wireless mic on each podium and then have that go to the sound board. This way, myself and the nine players don't need to be micced. I'm also big on making it as unlikely as possible that players will trip on cables.

Problem is, the mics I've found are either low quality (I tried https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK8P1HFB and the static was atrocious; I had also bought https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNJPZPV3 to get it to fit into another port and it didn't help), or it's one mic per XLR.

Are there any wireless mics that y'all would recommend to resolve this?",2,1763230603.0,techtheatre,7,1.0,False
1oxyqo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1oxyqo6/my_best_friend_ghosted_me_after_18_years_of/,"My best friend ghosted me after 18 years of friendship, years later it still guts me","I need to vent and don't really want to talk about it with any of the people I know. Sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I don't feel like double checking what I write.

I don't remember the time before I've known my childhood best friend, we were born only 3 months apart and our parents were close friends when they had us. Our first photo is of us laying together in a crib. At least half of my childhood photos are with her, I avoid my family's photo albums because of it. I also avoid reminiscing about my childhood. We went to holidays together, visited each others extended families, shared hobbies, did everything together. 

We never had mutual friends, different preschools and high schools, and no classes together in elementary and middle school. Because of that a lot of people only knew us in the context of the other. Even now, years later when I visit my home town people ask me about her, like it's obvious I would know what to say. 

We started drifting apart in high school, I don't really know why and didn't notice at first. She would cancel meeting me last minute and not really plan the hang outs herself, but whenever we saw each other it was good, like it's always been.

So I ignored it and powered through, it was close to my 18th birthday by then and I couldn't imagine her not being a part of it. How could she spend my whole childhood with me, but not witness its ending? I promised myself that after that I would wait for her to text me first, invite me, whatever. And she never did. She showed up on my birthday, partied with my other friends, hugged me at the end, left and that was the last time I've seen her.

Years later my brain still wouldn't get that she wasn't part of my life anymore, in a lot of my dreams we still were friends, I would wake up in a rotten mood every few weeks because of it. I needed closure, so shortly after my 21st birthday, despite feeling pathetic about it, I texted her, explained how the last year of our friendship looked from my perspective and asked if she would consider meeting me for a coffee. She left me on delivered for a week, and on read ever since.

And it, to this day, guts me. Loosing a friend is hardly the worst thing I've went through and my life has been good. I'm close to finishing my degree, I'm living with the love of my life, I've got new friends and I'm still friends with all of the other people that were on my 18th birthday party. And despite all that, whenever I achieve a milestone, her not knowing about it hurts me the same way as dead family members not knowing about it.

And what caused me to think about all of this today, out of all days, years later? A stupid breakfast photo on a insta story. Shortly after I posted it I saw my followers count go down by one. Since only 10ish people saw it by then I got nosy and checked which of them unfollowed me. Well, it was her. And I know it doesn't change shit if she follows me or not, we haven't talked in years, I don't know anything about her anymore. Despite it I've felt the whole day like somebody put my insides the wrong side up.

So this is it, end of the Ted talk or whatever. I hope somebody reads it so it doesn't stay just in my head.",3,1763230582.0,lostafriend,2,1.0,False
1oxyqju,https://i.redd.it/ix182s6ojg1g1.png,Chaga mashroom powder: The Black Gold of the Forest,"Growing as a dark, cracked, charcoal-like mass on birch trees in cold northern climates, Chaga (*Inonotus obliquus*) is a fungus that has been used for centuries in Russian and Northern European folk medicine. It doesn't resemble a typical mushroom; instead, it's a sclerotium, a dense mass of hardened mycelium. This ""King of Medicinal Mushrooms"" is now the subject of intense modern scientific research, revealing a complex profile of bioactive compounds that offer significant health benefits. Unlike turmeric, its primary strength lies not in a single compound but in a powerful synergy of many.



# Quality

1. **Wild‑harvested sclerotium** \- the true canker taken from a birch tree
2. **Mycelium grown on grain** (IoMFG) - Grain‑grown (rice or oats) mycelium often ends up similar to the cereal it’s grown on: relatively low in beta‑glucans and high in **alpha‑glucans**, which are mostly inactive starches that dilute the mushroom’s active compounds.

The difference matters because the healing reputation of Chaga depends largely on its **beta‑glucans**, beneficial structural carbohydrates found in the true sclerotium. Quick buying tips:

* **Look for “sclerotium” or “fruiting body”** on the label rather than “mycelium on grain.”
* **Check for beta‑glucan percent or standardized extract**—higher numbers mean more of the active stuff.
* **Prefer dual (hot water + alcohol) extracts or clearly labeled high‑beta‑glucan powders** rather than plain powdered chips or grain‑based mycelium.





# Positive Health Effects of Chaga (The ""Why"")

Chaga's health benefits are attributed to its rich and unique composition, which it derives primarily from the birch trees it grows on. Chaga absorbs **betulin** from the birch tree and turns it into **betulinic acid**, a compound studied for its **immune-supporting effects**.

1. **Beta‑D‑glucans** regulate and “train” the immune system by modulating **cytokine** signalling and supporting *macrophages* and *natural killer* (NK) cells. Unlike a simple “immune boost,” they strengthen defenses against infection while calming overactive responses. As **adaptogens**, they improve resilience to stress and help restore balanced immune responses.
2. **Antioxidants.** Chaga has one of the highest **ORAC scores (146,700)** in the world. Its **phenolic compounds** neutralize harmful free radicals, while its **melanins**—the same pigment that protects human skin—help shield cells from oxidative stress. These neutralize free radicals, protect cells from oxidative stress, and, by reducing that stress, help lower chronic inflammation linked to aging and many diseases.
3. **Cancer.** Modern research shows promising effects of Chaga in animal studies. Extracts appear to slow tumor growth and can trigger cancer cells to self-destruct (apoptosis) without harming healthy cells.
   1. Betulin from Chage directly targets the mitochondria of tumor cells, the cellular powerhouses responsible for energy production. By disrupting mitochondrial function, it triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death) specifically within cancerous cells, a pathway that has shown efficacy even against tumor types resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
4. **Liver.** Chaga may also help protect the liver from damage and reduce oxidative stress linked to conditions like fatty liver disease. 
5. **Inflammation**. Betulin from Chaga reduces systemic inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecules that modulate immune responses. Betulinic acid, which features a carboxyl group, also exhibits promising biological activities, including anti-HIV and broad antimicrobial effects.
6. **Gut Health.** The anti-inflammatory properties of Chaga may benefit individuals with inflammatory bowel conditions. Furthermore, as a prebiotic, the polysaccharides can help nourish the beneficial microbiome, which is crucial for overall health.
   1. A study published in *Molecules(*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807453/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807453/) *)* found that both water- and alcohol-based extracts protected cells from inflammation triggered by pathogenic microbes, underscoring Chaga’s potential to support gut integrity and overall immune balance.
7. **Blood Sugar.** Animal studies show Chaga can lower fasting and post‑meal glucose, enhance pancreatic insulin production, reduce insulin resistance, and inhibit carbohydrate‑digesting enzymes (like alpha‑glucosidase) to blunt glucose spikes.
8. **Cholesterol.** Hypolipidemic effects were shown in preclinical studies, lowering LDL (""bad"") and triglycerides while raising HDL(""good""), changes that may reduce cardiovascular risk.



# Possible Negative Effects (The ""What to Avoid"")

Chaga’s strong natural acids can be harmful if consumed the wrong way.

1. **High Oxalate Risk.** Chaga is packed with oxalates, compounds that can bind with calcium to form crystals. In excess, these crystals may build up in tissues, cause gout, or damage the kidneys by leading to kidney stones or even kidney failure.
   1. 72-year-old woman in Japan who consumed 4–5 teaspoons of raw Chaga daily for 6 months and died from kidney failure.
   2. 69-year-old man, taking 10–15g daily with vitamin C for 3 months, developed severe kidney damage.
   3. Strictly avoid consuming the raw, ground, solid state. Use only water- or alcohol-extracted forms (tea, tincture, pre-extracted powder)
   4. Be cautious with high-dose calcium supplements, as excess calcium can bind with oxalates and strain the kidneys.
   5. Steer clear of vitamin C supplements, as they exacerbated oxalate nephropathy in cases.
   6. 100 grams of dried Chaga contains significant soluble oxalates (800 mg, roughly equivalent to half a cup of spinach)
2. **Blood Thinning.** Chaga contains coumarin, a natural blood thinner. This can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising, especially for people taking medications like warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin, or before surgery.
3. **Blood Sugar.** Chaga may lower blood sugar levels. People with diabetes or hypoglycemia should monitor closely, as it can intensify the effects of medication and potentially cause dangerously low levels.
4. **Immune System.** In some cases, Chaga may overstimulate the immune system, which could trigger flare-ups in people with autoimmune conditions.

# 

# When to Consume Chaga:

* **In the Morning.** It offers a gentle, non‑jittery, caffeine‑free, sustained energy boost that makes a good coffee alternative.  Experts suggest daily use (about 6 days a week) for at least 5 weeks to allow its adaptogenic and immunomodulatory effects to develop, but cycle off periodically to avoid tolerance.
* **During Times of Stress:** As an adaptogen, consuming it daily during physically or mentally stressful periods can help support resilience.

# 

# How to Consume Chaga

Chaga is very hard and nearly indigestible raw (the safest option is buying pre‑extracted powders). Its active compounds must be extracted with hot water or alcohol to be bioavailable. Simply mixing the powder into cold water will not release its primary medicinal properties. The typical limit is up to 2g/day.



**Water Extract:**

1. For one cup, use **0.5-1 teaspoon of Chaga powder** or 1-2 chunks of dried Chaga.
2. Add to a saucepan with **8-12 oz of near-boiling water** (do not use a rolling boil, as extreme heat can degrade some compounds).
3. Simmer gently for at least **10-15 minutes**. Longer simmering (up to an hour or more) will yield a stronger, more potent extraction.
4. Strain into a mug. The resulting liquid will be a dark, coffee-like color with a slightly earthy, vanilla-like flavor.

# Alcohol Extraction (Tincture)

1. **Prepare.** Break dried Chaga chunks into small pieces or grind into coarse powder. The smaller the pieces, the more surface area for extraction.
2. **Choose the alcohol.** Use **40–50% alcohol** (vodka or grain alcohol diluted with water). This strength extracts and keeps the tincture shelf-stable.
3. **Wait.** Place Chaga in a glass jar (about 1 part Chaga to 5 parts alcohol). Seal the jar tightly. Store in a cool, dark place for **at least 4–6 weeks**, shaking occasionally.
4. **Strain.** After soaking, strain out the solids using cheesecloth or a fine filter. Keep the liquid — this is your **alcohol extract**.

# Dual Extraction (to capture water-soluble compounds too)

1. **Simmer the leftover Chaga.** After straining, take the same Chaga solids and simmer them gently in water (not boiling hard) for 1–2 hours. Strain out solids — keep this **water extract**.
2. **Combine.** Mix the cooled water extract with the alcohol extract in a clean jar. Final product contains both alcohol-soluble triterpenes (like betulinic acid) and water-soluble polysaccharides (like beta-glucans). This is the best way to get Chaga’s full benefits.

# Storage

* Store in dark glass bottles (amber dropper bottles work best).
* Shelf life: usually **1+ years** thanks to alcohol.





# Tracking Chaga with the [Vitamin App](https://apple.co/42OdSEx)

To get the most out of chaga, consistency is key. Use the [Vitamin app](https://apple.co/42OdSEx) developed by [Martspec to log doses](https://martspec.com/vitamin), set reminders, and track your intake.

# How to set it up and use it

* **Create a custom entry** for Chaga Powder and record the dose in milligrams.
* **Schedule daily reminders** to take it with food and mark doses as taken.
* **Track context** like co‑supplements, meal timing, or products with black pepper to record factors that affect absorption.
* **Review trends** with the app’s history share that record with your healthcare provider when needed.

# Conclusion: A Powerful Fungal Ally, Demanding Respect and Caution

Chaga is a remarkable medicinal fungus with profound immune-modulating and antioxidant properties. Its ability to help the body adapt to stress and fight oxidative damage makes it a valuable tool in the modern wellness arsenal.

However, its high oxalate content presents a serious and non-negotiable risk for a significant portion of the population.",1,1763230575.0,u_Antique_Way_3813,0,1.0,False
