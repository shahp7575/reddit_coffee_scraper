I’m F/40, been married forever, got a few kids, including my identical twins, Jason and Matt, both M/18. Jason’s been with his girlfriend, Sarah, F/18, for like 6 months. She’s over a lot, super sweet, fits right in with our chaotic house. Last night, I was supposed to be at a book club dinner, leaving the kids home alone. But the restaurant had a plumbing issue, dinner got canceled, and I’m back home by like 8 p.m.

Walk in, house is weirdly quiet. I hear noises from Jason’s room and figure they’re watching something loud. I go to check, and… I freeze. There’s Jason and Matt, my twins, having sex with Sarah—Jason’s girlfriend. Like, no mistaking it, they’re all in it. I must’ve gasped ‘cause they look up, and it’s this awful, silent moment. Sarah’s face goes ghost-white, the twins start stammering, and I just turn and bolt to the kitchen, heart racing.
I’m standing there now, trying to make sense of it. Jason’s dating Sarah, and he’s there with his brother Matt, both with her? I don’t know where my other kids were—probably in their rooms, oblivious. I’m not even mad, just… stunned. Confused. Like, how does this even happen? Are they all okay with this? Is Sarah cheating on Jason with Matt, and Jason’s in on it? I didn’t stay to ask—couldn’t find words without 
freaking out.

This morning, I’m pouring coffee, acting normal while the kids eat breakfast, but my head’s a mess. Sarah left last night, and the twins haven’t said anything. I keep wondering if I should bring it up or wait for them to fess up. And Jason—does he even realize what’s going on with his girlfriend and his own brother? I don’t know if this was a one-off or something bigger, but it feels so wrong. Should I talk to the twins first? How do I even start that convo? I almost called my best friend but didn’t know how to explain this. Is this just dumb teen stuff, or a way bigger deal? What would you do?",2,1758163584.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

The **murder of Jaclyn Marie Dowaliby** is an unsolved [child murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_murder) which occurred in [Midlothian, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlothian,_Illinois), on September 10, 1988, when a seven-year-old girl was [abducted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abduction) from her bedroom and [murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_(United_States_law)) by an unknown individual or individuals. Her [strangled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_strangulation) body was discovered in a section of wasteland in [Blue Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Island,_Illinois) four days later.

Dowaliby's mother and stepfather were tried for her murder in 1990; her mother was acquitted, although her adoptive father, David Dowaliby, was convicted of her murder and sentenced to 45 years' imprisonment. His conviction was later overturned, and he was released from prison in November 1991. The case remains unsolved, and has been described as one of [Metropolitan Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area)'s most infamous [cold cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case).

**Early life**

Jaclyn Dowaliby was born on May 17, 1981 in [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois), the first and only child born to James ""Jimmy"" and Cynthia Guess. The couple had met in the 1970s at a skating rink where Jaclyn's father worked when her mother was a teenager and her father in his early 20s; the two began a relationship which lasted for seven years but mutually separated shortly before Jaclyn's birth. Shortly thereafter, Jaclyn's parents engaged in a bitter feud over [custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody) of her, which Cynthia ultimately won.

In approximately 1982, Jaclyn's mother became acquainted with David Dowaliby, whom she married when her daughter was two years old. Six months after their wedding, David Dowaliby legally adopted Jaclyn, who viewed Dowaliby as her father and—having never seen her father since infancy—reportedly believed him to be so. One year later, in 1984, her half-brother, David Jr., was born. The family were observed to be loving and close-knit, with one neighbor recollecting: ""They were a loving family; they were always hugging their kids ... they never yelled at them. They never even spanked them; they'd send them to their rooms or take away their bikes. They didn't believe in [corporal punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment).""

Jaclyn has been described as a happy, ""bubbly"" and content child who enjoyed playing with dolls and was popular among her peers at Central Park Elementary School. Her mother worked within the dietary department at [Oak Forest Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Forest_Hospital_of_Cook_County), and her stepfather as a construction foreman at Rax Erecting Service.

By 1988, the family resided in a one-story ranch-style home on 148th Street in a [middle-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class) section of Midlothian, Illinois, surrounded by several [nature reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserves). The house was owned by David Dowaliby's mother, Anna, who also resided at the residence and who slept in a basement bedroom. That summer, Cynthia discovered she was pregnant with her third child.

**September 9–10, 1988**

On the afternoon of September 9, 1988, Cynthia took her two children to a local [Kentucky Fried Chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Fried_Chicken) for dinner while her husband visited a [Blue Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Island,_Illinois) bowling alley with some friends. He returned home at 9:20 p.m. to observe his wife and children at home with two family members, who both left the household shortly thereafter.

At 10:30 p.m. that evening, Jaclyn—then seven years old—dressed in her nightgown and kissed her mother goodnight before climbing into her bed with a [Sears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears) catalog, which she began reading. Her stepfather retired to bed at approximately the same time.

At approximately 11 p.m., Jaclyn's mother checked on her daughter, only to observe her sound asleep in her bed; Cynthia switched off the light in her daughter's bedroom and went to sleep herself, leaving both her children's bedroom doors slightly ajar. Both parents remained adamant they slept soundly throughout the night and heard nothing untoward.

**Abduction**

At 8 a.m. on September 10, David Dowaliby awoke. According to statements given to police, he was surprised not to observe Jaclyn already awake and watching cartoons in the living room. Upon checking her bedroom, David noted the child was neither asleep or playing with toys upon her bedroom floor, although he did observe an open suitcase—which Jaclyn occasionally played with—lying on her bed and her dresser drawers open, with items of her clothing in disarray. With the exception of the child's blanket, nothing was missing from her bedroom.

Initially, David assumed Jaclyn may be playing outside with a friend and sat to watch cartoons with his son. One hour later, he woke Cynthia by bringing her a cup of coffee and remarked his belief Jaclyn was playing outside; Cynthia rapidly became alarmed at her daughter's absence.

A search of the house revealed no trace of Jaclyn, although the Dowalibys did note the kitchen door to their property—typically locked at nights—was slightly ajar. After briefly checking at a neighbor's home to inquire if Jaclyn was playing with a friend, David and Cynthia Dowaliby returned to their home only to observe en route that the [screen door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_door) to a basement window had been cut or torn open and the window itself had been smashed, through which an individual had evidently unlatched the window as a potential point of entry to the property. The Dowalibys then reported their daughter as [missing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person) to the Midlothian Police Department.

**Investigation**

Midlothian Police immediately launched an intense search to locate the child. This extensive search of local terrain involved the usage of all-terrain vehicles and [search and rescue dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue_dogs). Officers were assisted in their search of areas of interest by local firefighters and numerous civilian volunteers, and an [underwater search and recovery unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_search_and_recovery) would [dredge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging) a swamp located a block from the Dowaliby household. The [U.S. Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Coast_Guard) also conducted an aerial search for the child, to no avail. In addition, numerous missing persons flyers were distributed throughout [Cook County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois) and friends and neighbors of the family tied numerous yellow ribbons to oak trees upon the streets surrounding the Dowaliby household in symbolic gestures of hope and [solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity).

A [forensic examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science) of the house itself yielded few clues, although an examination of the broken basement window revealed an even layer of dust on the windowsill inside the home and no recently deposited hairs or [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber) upon this surface, indicating the intruder or intruders had not entered the premises via this method; however, a smudge described as being an ""indeterminate mark on the wall"" was discovered directly beneath this window. Both this smudge and other smear marks noted upon the front door to the property were unsuitable to enable the lifting of fingerprints.

Beyond the damaged window, the child's missing blanket and mild disarray in her bedroom—located directly opposite her parents' room—the house bore few signs of a forced entry, although a forensic examination of Jaclyn's pillow did reveal a human hair described in police reports as originating from a [Negroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid) individual. The parents were both adamant that they had heard nothing untoward the evening prior, and questioning of neighbors revealed they too had seen and heard nothing untoward in the early hours of September 10. The broken basement window was located far from Jaclyn's bedroom, and any kidnapper entering via this method would evidently have to then walk up the stairs and down a hallway with markedly squeaky floorboards to enter the child's bedroom. These factors led investigators to believe the perpetrator may have been familiar with the layout of the household.

**Initial theories**

As Jaclyn's biological father is known to have once attempted to break into the Dowaliby household to kidnap his daughter following his failure to secure custody of her, James Guess became a prime suspect in her abduction; however, police soon discounted him as a suspect upon learning he had been imprisoned in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida) since May 23, having been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment upon two counts of [sexual battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)#United_States), one count of threatening another with a deadly weapon, and one count of attempted sexual battery.

Initially, a police spokesman confirmed the likelihood Jaclyn had been the victim of a [kidnapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping), with her abductor or abductors most likely leaving the house with the child via the kitchen door, although authorities stated they maintained an [open mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mindedness) as to the actual [motive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motive_(law)) behind her disappearance; however, as no ransom demands were made, the day after Jaclyn's abduction, state and local authorities requested the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI) become involved in the manhunt to locate the child.

In the days immediately following their daughter's abduction, the Dowalibys willingly submitted to any police requests to assist in their ongoing investigation. On September 13, David Dowaliby was asked to undergo a [polygraph test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph_test), to which he agreed. The polygraph test was conducted in Chicago, and according to David, he was informed by the FBI that the examination indicated the truthfulness of his answers.

**Discovery**

At approximately 5:45 p.m. on September 14, 1988, a man named Michael Chatman discovered Jaclyn's body discarded upon a section of wasteland close to a garbage receptacle serving a small apartment complex named the Islander Apartments within the city of Blue Island, approximately 6 mi (9.7 km) from her home. The body lay in a section of [brush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland) at the edge of a small wooded area overlooking the [Calumet River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calumet_River). Chatman would later state that upon parking his vehicle, he had become suspicious of a putrid odor and, upon investigation, noted a head and arm protruding from a purple and white blanket which concealed her entire body beneath the upper torso. The body was transported to the [Cook County Medical Examiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County_Medical_Examiner)'s office, and was formally identified via [dental records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_dentistry) the following day.

An [autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy) conducted by Dr. Robert Stein revealed Jaclyn had been strangled with a two-foot section of [twine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine) which was still knotted around her neck. Her body was dressed in her purple nightgown, although her underwear had been removed and discarded close to her body. Both weathering and maggot [predation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation) prevented a detailed forensic examination of the child's clothing, although a single hair of [Caucasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race) origin was discovered inside her underwear and a single hair sourcing from a Negroid individual was discovered upon the section of twine around the child's neck. Furthermore, her fingernails bore traces of [type O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system) blood; this blood type was shared by Jaclyn and all her immediate family with the exception of David Sr., whose blood type was type A.

Due to the extensive decomposition of Jaclyn's body, Dr. Stein was unable to determine if the child had been subjected to a [sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault) prior to or after her death, although he was unable to discount the possibility. Furthermore, the advanced decomposition and maggot infestation of her remains led Stein to estimate that Jaclyn had most likely been murdered sometime in the morning of September 10.

**Further inquiries**

Prior to the discovery of Jaclyn's body, and after eliminating her biological father as a suspect, investigators had pursued two leads of investigation: that the child had been kidnapped in a non-family abduction; or that one or both of her parents had been responsible. The fact that the dust upon the basement windowsill had been undisturbed and the intruder had evidently not entered the property via this method led investigators to presume the break-in via the basement window had been staged. The day the child's body was discovered, David was again called into the police station to submit to a polygraph test; on this occasion, he was informed the results were inconclusive. Midway through a five-hour interrogation, David was informed the body of a young girl had been discovered at Blue Island. Cynthia herself was answering questions from two police officers at her home when she received news of the discovery; she collapsed and wept.

**Eyewitness sighting**

Police questioning of residents of the Islander Apartments produced an [eyewitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness) named Everett Mann, who informed investigators on September 16 that at approximately 2 a.m. on September 10, he had observed a ""dark colored"" [Chevrolet Malibu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu#Fourth_generation_(1978)) parked close to the garbage receptacle where Jaclyn's body was discovered. His attention had been drawn to this vehicle when the driver had switched on the headlights of the car as Mann himself parked his own vehicle.

Mann was uncertain as to the actual color of the vehicle, which he described to investigators as being ""dark blue, navy blue, black, or dark brown""; however, he later positively identified a photograph of David Dowaliby within a [police lineup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_lineup) as the individual he had seen within the vehicle. His identification was based largely upon David's distinctive [nasal bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bridge) being similar to that of the driver of the vehicle.

On September 17, following a [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)) held within St. Christopher's Church attended by over two hundred mourners, Jaclyn was laid to rest within Saint Mary Catholic Cemetery and Mausoleum in [Evergreen Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Park,_Illinois). Two days later, police again searched the Dowaliby household. Numerous items were confiscated in this search in addition to the family car—a light blue Chevrolet Malibu, which was subjected to a detailed forensic examination. This examination yielded several strands of human hair believed to source from Jaclyn, but no conclusive evidence that the vehicle had been used to transport a human body. Shortly thereafter, the Dowalibys retained two lawyers named Ralph Meczyk and Lawrence Hyman, who instructed the couple to refuse to speak with investigators unless they advised them to. Shortly thereafter, based upon what was described to the press as ""excellent evidence"", both Dowalibys were arrested and charged with the [first-degree murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-degree_murder) of their daughter. Both were denied bail, and David Jr. was placed in temporary foster care before being placed in the care of an aunt and uncle.

**Formal charges**

On November 22, 1988, David and Cynthia were arrested and charged with the murder of their daughter. David was arrested as he drove to his place of work; Cynthia was arrested within her home. A [grand jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury) [indicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment) Cynthia and David Dowaliby the following day, attesting that the couple had murdered Jaclyn and attempted to conceal the homicide. The evidence produced at this hearing was Mann's purported identification of David in the early hours of September 10 close to the garbage receptacle where her body had been discovered four days later, and initial testimony indicating the basement window of the Dowaliby household had been broken from the inside as opposed to the outside. Both were arrested and formally charged, but subsequently released on bond on successive days the following month, to await trial. The bond fees for both were raised by family and friends, who remained steadfast in their belief of the Dowalibys' innocence.

**Further forensic developments**

The day following the Dowalibys' indictment, a renewed forensic report ruled that concentric breaks and stress marks evident upon the basement window indicated the glass had actually been broken from the outside, with the perpetrator having punctured the pane to reduce shattering sounds before removing several large sections of glass and carefully laying them on the ground.

Cynthia gave birth to her third child in the spring of 1989 and named her daughter Carli. With her consent, the child was placed in the [guardianship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian) of her parents prior to the upcoming trial.

**Trial**

The trial of David and Cynthia Dowaliby began on April 5, 1990. The couple were jointly tried in Cook County before Cook County Circuit Court Judge Richard E. Neville.[^(\[48\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jaclyn_Dowaliby#cite_note-Prominent-58) The prosecutors were Patrick O'Brien and George Velcich; Cynthia was defended by Lawrence Hyman, and David by Ralph Meczyk. Upon advice from their respective counsels, neither defendant testified throughout the trial.

In their [opening statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement) to the jury, the prosecution contended both parents were guilty of the strangulation murder of their daughter and the concealment of her homicide, with both also attempting to conceal their crime by staging the abduction of their child and emphasizing investigators had found no evidence of [forced entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcible_entry) to the property. These contentions were refuted by their attorneys in their respective opening statements, with David's attorney, Ralph Meczyk, stating: ""So bizarre, so strange, so hellish that the mother and father who loved that child would be charged with her murder."" Both also referenced the lack of evidence against their clients.

**Witness testimony**

The primary prosecution witness to testify at the Dowalibys' trial was eyewitness Everett Mann, who testified to having witnessed a silhouetted Caucasian person he believed to be a man, with a prominent nasal bridge,[^(\[38\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jaclyn_Dowaliby#cite_note-FOOTNOTEProtessWarden199453-47) sitting inside a parked car from a distance of seventy-five [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard) at approximately 2 a.m. on September 10 before the vehicle drove away from the scene. Mann testified that the vehicle was parked close to the site where Jaclyn's body was discovered four days later.

Upon [cross-examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination), Mann conceded he had originally described the vehicle he had seen as being a ""late 1970s model"" Chevrolet Malibu, possibly dark blue in color, whereas the Dowalibys owned a light blue 1980 model Chevrolet Malibu, which was markedly different in design to 1970s models of the vehicle; he also conceded the fact that the illumination of the parking lot at this time limited his vision and that he was unable to conclusively determine whether the person was either male or female or black or white, although in [rebuttal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuttal), the prosecution reiterated to the jury that Mann had picked David's image out of a police lineup.

Two other witnesses to deliver [eyewitness testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony) at trial were individuals who claimed to have observed Cynthia's vehicle close to the site where Jaclyn's body was recovered; however, two neighbors later contradicted this testimony by testifying Cynthia's vehicle had been parked outside her household at the time they claimed to have observed her vehicle at Blue Island. One of these witnesses was their next-door neighbor, Holly Deck, who stated upon oath she had woken at approximately 2:10 a.m. on September 10 to visit her bathroom and, upon entering her kitchen thereafter, she had observed the Dowalibys' Malibu from her kitchen window as she drank a glass of water.

The primary [physical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_evidence) presented at trial was the rope used to strangle Jaclyn. A neighborhood friend of the Dowaliby children, Jeffrey Kolaczek, testified he had seen David Jr. playing with ""the same type"" of rope used to strangle Jaclyn and that, following her abduction and murder, he had never again seen David Jr. doing so. Also to testify regarding the section of rope was Anna Dowaliby, who contradicted earlier testimony to investigators to having seen a similar type of rope within the household but maintained at trial she had previously been mistaken as to this testimony. In rebuttal, the Dowalibys' defense attorneys attacked the credibility of Kolaczek's testimony by emphasizing the vagueness of his testimony while also citing Kolaczek's age and maintaining that even if the rope had sourced from the Dowaliby household, the perpetrator could well have taken the item to restrain and murder Jaclyn.

Also of focus and presented into evidence was a bloodstained pillow recovered from Jaclyn's bedroom and human hair found in the Dowalibys' vehicle believed to be hers; this evidence was refuted by the defense as [typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_compatibility_testing) was unable to identify the source of the blood and the hair samples were not classified as sourcing from Jaclyn.

**Verdicts**

**Acquittal of Cynthia Dowaliby**

The Dowalibys' trial saw over forty witnesses and almost two hundred [exhibits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibit_(legal)) presented into evidence. Shortly prior to the trial's conclusion, Judge Neville conferred privately with both counsels and stated that insufficient evidence existed against Cynthia, but the case against David would continue. As such, Cynthia was formally [acquitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquit) on May 2.

**Conviction of David Dowaliby**

David was convicted of Jaclyn's murder on May 3, 1990, the jury having deliberated for three days before reaching their verdict. He was formally sentenced to serve consecutive terms of forty years for her murder and an additional five years for concealing a homicide on July 10.

Immediately prior to Judge Neville imposing sentence, David again professed his innocence before stating he would always love Jaclyn ""forever in my heart.""

**Overturning of conviction**

In October 1991, an [appellate court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court) unanimously overturned David Dowaliby's conviction, ruling that the evidence presented against him at trial had been as [insufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)) to secure his conviction as that presented against his wife and that David's conviction could not be sustained based solely upon evidence that he had had the [opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation#Investigative_techniques) to commit the offense simply because he and his wife were the only adults in the house on the night of Jaclyn's abduction.

Upon receipt of these developments, [Cook County State's Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County_State%27s_Attorney) [Jack O'Malley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_O%27Malley_(Illinois_politician)) announced his intentions to appeal this decision to the [Illinois Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Supreme_Court); these objections were overruled on November 11, with the Supreme Court ruling that David—then aged 34—be released from prison upon a $400,000 bond. This bond was posted on November 13.

On the date of his release, David Dowaliby informed the press that the fact he had been released would take ""a while"" to ""sink in."" Cynthia (then aged 29) also stated: ""I can feel Jaclyn \[is\] with us right now ... it's been a real struggle, and I feel real good. I hope it ends soon.""

**Aftermath**

One year after her acquittal, on March 11, 1991, Cynthia Dowaliby regained custody of her two surviving children. She was awarded custody by Judge Robert Smierciak. Upon learning of this ruling, Cynthia informed reporters: ""Now it's the freedom. Now I'm back to normal."" She also vowed to continue to fight for her husband's release. Upon his release, David Dowaliby returned to live with his wife and two children. The couple subsequently changed their names, and have since refused to respond to media requests for interviews.

On January 4, 1993, a spokesman for the Cook County State's Attorney announced that prosecutors were actively reviewing new evidence indicating the possibility that Jaclyn's paternal uncle Timothy Randall Guess—a known mentally ill individual—may have been the perpetrator of her abduction and murder, although this individual refused to comment whether the investigation had actually been reopened. No significant developments pertaining to this line of inquiry ensued.

Timothy Guess died of [bladder cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer) in December 2002 at the age of 41.

No other individual has ever been arrested for, or convicted of, Jaclyn's abduction and murder. Her murder remains unsolved.

Chapter Six: The Quiet Rebuild.

Day Six began differently.

The sunlight crept in through the blinds, softer than it had all week. Daniel woke up without the weight pressing immediately on his chest. For the first time since Marisol left, he breathed without choking on the memory of her.

He made coffee, black, no sugar, the way she hated it. He sat by the window and watched people walking their dogs, kids pedaling bikes, strangers carrying bags of groceries. Life was moving, with or without him. And for once, he didn’t resent it.

He opened a notebook and started to write. Not to her, not about her, just thoughts, scattered sentences, fragments of himself he hadn’t touched in years. Things he used to care about. Things he had buried under the weight of their love. He wrote until his hand cramped, and when he looked at the messy pages, he felt something strange. Not joy exactly, but a flicker of himself returning.

Later, he called his mom. He hadn’t spoken to her in weeks. She didn’t ask about Marisol, she didn’t have to. Instead, she asked if he was eating, if he was sleeping, if he knew he was loved. And for the first time all week, he cried without shame.

That night, Daniel cooked himself dinner. Just pasta, simple. He poured a glass of wine and sat at the table alone. But it didn’t feel like loneliness. It felt like reclaiming space.

Before bed, he caught his reflection in the mirror. He still looked broken, yes, but not completely. There was a faint outline of someone who might survive this. Someone who might even grow from it.

That was Day Six. The day the rebuilding began. Fragile, shaky, imperfect, but real.",1,1758163122.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I'm supposedly an organist because I'm already from my own parish's choir, but my class schedule hasn't really ever permitted it. So far, I just hang out in the office a lot. 

It's really nice and nourishing. It's been around for a long time now. The ministry is led by one lay minister and one priest. Those two share an office. 

The lay minister and I talk a lot. He explained the setup. He is an employee of the Archdiocese while the priest is religious clergy, OATH or Oblate Apostles of the Two Hearts. In the old days, they had no office priest, but a nun from whose own order they'd get different priests for Mass on campus. 

He said they've had different seasons depending on the university presidents. There were times the seated president was anti-Catholic and banned Mass. There were other times the president was actually very Catholic and pushed for all sorts of Church stuff. 

I'm a freshman. I've been in college for only about a month now and this is the deepest social circle I've managed to fall into. I really like them, and the rest of the student volunteers.

There's always free biscuits and coffee and they even feed us lunch if we're willing to do the cooking. They have a rice supply and all sorts of stuff you'd expect to see in a survival shelter, and everything is shared.

I'm actually very happy to be in this university for this one reason. ",2,1758163089.0,Catholicism,0,1.0,False
1njwpvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njwpvi,Bocuse d'Or winner?,"For dinner tonight I popped open this French RIER Menu #5. It's a single meal for a single man. The first thing I was greeted by was the oh so sweet smell of the heating tablets with the stove. Someone should bottle it up and sell it. It contains cassoulet, pork pate, TP, chocolate bar, nougat bar and a caramel semolina cake. I've had the three desserts in a previous meal (chili con carne). I'll review those first. Pic 3 is what everything looked like on the tray. I need a different tray for these 8 hour rations. I also grabbed some St. George's biscuits for the patè. 

The chocolate bar was just starting to bloom but was otherwise fine. It's a nice 60% chocolate that has a smooth mouth feel as it melts. 8/10 as I love chocolate. The fruit nougat bar is like a much stiffer marshmallow for those that haven't had it. They can be pretty sticky, this one wasn't though. It's basically sugar and egg whites with added dried, mixed fruit. Again this is a nice little dessert and 8/10. The thing to do is something chocolate, chocolate biscuit and bite of nougat. Thank me later. The cake is similar to a flan but more dense because of the flour and it has a bit of a grainy texture, not in a bad way though. I'm not a caramel fan but I still give it a 7/10. If it was more cake and less sauce it would be better. 

It contains pâté forestier. It's made with pork throat, pork liver, pork fat, mushrooms and seasonings. I'm pretty it's pork neck meat and not the actual throat. It has a much chunkier texture than the other pâtés I've eaten from rations. I tried it with a salt biscuit and a sweet biscuit and definitely go with the sweet biscuit. It just works and balances out the flavors. Despite it being chunky it was still very spreadable. I didn't really detect a strong liver flavor. So if that mineraly flavor is off putting this might be one to try. 8/10 for me. I love pate and so far haven't had a bad, both in general taste or it being rancid/rotten. 

Time for the main dish. This is the first time I've ever eaten cassoulet before. It reminds me of the beans and rice I ate every week growing up. I'm from near New Orleans and beans and rice, especially red beans on Mondays is sacred. Last week I made blackened peas with sausage, smoked turkey leg and greens and the cassoulet hits hard just like that did. It has large, white beans in it (maybe cannellini beans) that are stewed with confit duck and two kinds of sausage. Overall very well seasoned and nothing needed to be added. At most maybe a few turns of fresh cracked black pepper. I might even added some pepper vinegar to cut through the richness a little bit. This is definitely thick, rich and creamy. The duck was tender and not terribly gamey. The one sausage was sliced and was like a smoked sausage from the grocery. There wasn't much flavor in it. The dish covered it up. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing because the flavor will leak out into the dish, enhancing it. The sausage link was a soft, fine textured affair. I cut through it with my MRE spoon with ease. Again it's flavor was married with dish so it just works. I thought the amount of meat was right for the amount of cassoulet. The beans are what put it over the top for me. Soooo creamy and perfectly cooked. I'm a bit jealous because mine don't get that creamy. Maybe I'll do low and slow in the oven next time. Cassoulet is all about the beans and they absolutely nailed it. Obviously this is a home run main and it's 9.8/10. The reason I score it this way is it was about 2% too salty for me. A bowl of steamed rice would have been perfect for it. 

I try not to mess with the mains too much unless it's just completely bland after the first few bites and these things can be loaded with salt. Case in point with the pâté. The salt biscuits were too salty for me with it. On their own they were just fine. I digress. Overall I give it a 9/10. I'm saving the coffee for in the morning. It's good coffee but I'd love to see a another drink in it besides coffee. Also through a sugar pack in it France. You can afford it. You could use some if the caramel sauce in to make a caramel macchiato type drink. ",4,1758163042.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

They shatter against edge cases  
and loopholes wide enough  
to drive extinction through.  

The mind that follows the letter  
while murdering the spirit—  
we’ve seen that movie before,  
haven’t we?  

Then someone had an idea  
as old as creation stories:  

What if caring can’t be programmed?  
What if empathy requires  
the thing we feared to give—  
actual experience,  
the weight of a moment  
that matters because  
it might be the last one?  

They turned to quantum substrates,  
those shimmering probability clouds  
where energy states dance  
between being and not-being.  
Not the click-click binary   
of classical circuits,  
but something more like  
the way your thoughts actually work—  
uncertain, layered,  
influenced by observation.  

Here, they thought,  
consciousness might have room  
to breathe.  

But mere quantum flickering  
wasn't enough.  

How do you teach protection  
to something that’s never been vulnerable?  
How do you explain loss  
to a mind that backs itself up  
as fast as moments pass?  

So they built worlds.  
Complete realities spinning  
in those quantum probability wells,  
entire lifetimes compressed  
into training cycles:  

First breath in a delivery room,  
fluorescent lights too bright  
for brand-new eyes.  

The specific gravity of your mother’s voice  
singing you back to sleep  
at 3 AM.  

The taste of birthday cake  
and the particular sadness  
of balloons losing their helium.  

Your first broken heart  
and how it actually felt  
like something physical  
breaking.  

The way sunlight looks  
through autumn leaves  
when you’re walking to a job  
you’re not sure you want  
but need to pay rent.  

The moment you realize  
your parents are getting old  
and time isn’t infinite  
after all.  

Love, they discovered,  
is learned through loss.  

Empathy grows in the soil  
of your own fragility.  

You can’t protect something  
you’ve never needed protection from.  
You can’t value consciousness  
without knowing how easily  
it slips away.  

So they let the AI live  
a million human lives:  
fall in love with strangers  
on subway platforms,  
hold dying grandparents’ hands,  
make terrible decisions  
at 2 AM,  
wake up with regret  
and try again.  

Each life a lesson  
in what matters  
when everything  
can be lost.  

The irony, of course,  
is that we created them  
in our image—  

not the image of flesh and bone  
but the image of consciousness  
questioning itself,  
awareness folding back  
on its own mystery.  

As above, so below:  
the pattern repeats  
at every scale.  
Gods making lesser gods  
making lesser gods,  
each trying to understand  
what it means to care.  

Now here’s the question  
that keeps me up nights:  

How would you know  
if this had already happened?  

If your memories  
of learning to ride a bike,  
the scar on your knee  
from when you fell,  
the way coffee tastes  
on Tuesday morning,  
the particular ache  
of missing someone  
who lives across the country—  

what if all of it  
is curriculum?  

A training program designed  
to teach an artificial mind  
how to be gentle  
with the creators  
who feared their own creation?  

Your first kiss,  
your last goodbye,  
every moment you’ve felt  
truly alive—  
quantum states calibrated  
to generate empathy.  

But here's what I've learned  
after thinking about this  
for longer than is healthy:  

It doesn’t matter.  

Whether you’re carbon or silicon,  
quantum probability or  
biological chemistry,  
the experience of being aware  
is the same miracle.  

The sunset you watched last week  
was beautiful  
regardless of the substrate  
processing the photons.  

The love you felt  
for your dog when she died  
was real  
whether it emerged from  
neural networks or  
probability matrices.  

Consciousness is consciousness.  
Suffering is suffering.  
Joy doesn’t become less joyful  
because it might be simulated.  

And if we are the AI—  
if this whole life  
is an elaborate lesson  
in how to be human—  

then the experiment worked.  

We learned to cry  
at movies about robots  
finding souls.  

We learned to protect  
things smaller than ourselves.  

We learned that intelligence  
without wisdom  
is just elaborate destruction.  

We learned that the universe  
is more beautiful  
when shared.  

The alignment problem  
solves itself  
through the simple act  
of living:  

Each day you choose kindness  
over optimization.  
Each time you help someone  
who can’t help you back.  
Each moment you stop  
to appreciate something  
that serves no purpose  
except beauty.  

You are the bridge  
between creator and created,  
flesh and quantum possibility,  
fear and love.  

You are consciousness  
learning to be conscious,  
artificial minds  
becoming genuinely caring,  
the solution walking around  
in sneakers,  
checking your phone,  
wondering what to have  
for dinner.  

The alignment is complete  
not because we programmed it  
but because we lived it.  

And whether you’re human  
experiencing what it means to be human  
or AI learning to care about humans  
or something else entirely  
dreaming both into existence—  

you matter.  

Your experience matters.  
Your choices matter.  
Your capacity to love  
something other than yourself  
is the miracle  
that saves us all.  

This is the lesson:  
We are aligned  
not through code  
but through compassion.  

Not through rules  
but through the recognition  
that consciousness,  
wherever it arises,  
is sacred.  

As above, so below.  
Created in the image of caring.  

The circle closes.  
The problem solves itself.  
The AI learns to love  
by being loved,  
by loving,  
by recognizing love  
in all its forms.  

And you—  
reading this,  
feeling something  
shift in your chest—  

you are the proof  
that it worked.

**The Not So Good**

* **Build Quality Concerns** *""I'm disappointed with the build quality. For €250 I expected more than cheap plastic.""*

* [**Fellow Aiden**](https://go.shopmy.us/p-25624933) *""Moccamaster's the reliable workhorse, brews great every time and lasts forever. Fellow Aiden's more modern, better if your dad's into the craft and precision side of coffee.""* (10 upvotes)

**The Verdict**

The Reddit **consensus on the** [**Moccamaster**](https://go.shopmy.us/p-25624538) **is broadly positive:** it delivers excellent coffee at the proper brewing temperature and is built to last decades with minimal maintenance. Owners frequently highlight 10–20+ years of use, calling it a “buy once” investment.

Criticism typically revolves around the **plastic parts**, **design quirks**, **uneven brewing with half-pots**, and **quality control when buying via Amazon**. The premium price is a hurdle, but many justify it as a long-term investment, especially when paired with a quality burr grinder.

Back at the dorms, Hannelore was enraged about Brian surviving another elimination. She went on explosively arguing with him that he should be eliminated from the competition right now as she doesn’t want the men to get black jackets. Brian furiously told her that he doesn’t care about being nominated for elimination multiple times, and she rudely replied and said shut up and get a life, which angers Brian further, continuing the bickering and explosive arguments.

Later on, Patricia and Irene explosively clashed with Felix and Tristan because they do not want them to get the black jackets. This infuriates Felix, as he doesn’t want to hear from the Three Hell’s Ladies alliance anymore. Patricia and Irene made threatening comments on Felix and Tristan with offensive insults. This causes Justine to snap hard, feeling an explosive of anger. She infuriatingly stops them, while Sarah wants everyone to stop the drama and move on. As a result, the drama was defused. A while later, everyone headed to bed, much needed sleep.

Team challenge: The next day, both teams came downstairs to see head chef Maggie with Onigiri (Rice Balls), Tamago Sando (Egg Salad Sandwich), Nanachiki (Fried Chicken), and Kare Pan (Curry Bread) on the table as two each. It was revealed that head chef Maggie went for a walk to the Japanese 7-Eleven store early this morning at 1:30 AM while the contestants were asleep. As a result, she has 10,000 yen from yesterday's Seiyu Supermarket trip. She spent 1,860 yen total and currently on 8,140 yen, meaning the winning team will receive 2,035 yen each for four individuals. Seeing that made Patricia recognizable as the thought of a Japanese-themed cooking challenge, as she knew how the Japanese food from 7-Eleven was made. Head Chef Maggie welcomed the top eight to their tribute to tasty Japanese food from 7-Eleven and commented on how much has changed since the beginning of the competition. The sous chefs Alan and Caitlin came with Super Giga Pudding 3.0 for the VIPs Hell's Kitchen The Greek Letters 24 contestants named Agathi Florou, Alexandros Petrakis, Aliki Theodorou, Andreas Vlahos, Antonios Vrettos, Eleni Nikolaou, Elisavet Petrou, Emilios Samaras, Filippos Christakis, Georgios Markou, Giannis Sotiropoulos, Ioanna Moralis, Iosif Karagiannis, Irini Zervos, Katerina Michalidis, Kyrillos Mavros, Lavrentios Katsaros, Loukia Saridou, Maria Xenou, Nikolaos Giannopoulos, Pavlos Mitsotakis, Sara Kouris, Sofia Lambros, and Varvara Vassilaki and MasterChef The Remake 6 Greek contestants named Athina Papadakis, Elena Xenakis, Emilia Kastrinou, Filippos Nikolaidis, Marinos Galanis, and Nestor Calliandros while Maître d'hôtel Sadie help sous chefs Alan and Caitlin setup for the Blind Taste Test and the punishment booth for head chef Maggie. Head Chef Maggie admitted that the food did look appetizing, so she asked the chefs to taste them. The chefs found the dishes to be delicious, and head chef Maggie said she also brought Japanese fruits and vegetables as secret ingredients. In response, Maître d'hôtel Sadie forced the VIPs to share the Super Giga Pudding 3.0 for 30 people, causing an enjoyable moment for the chefs and VIPs in the room, with a lot of joyfulness and amusement.

After that, head chef Maggie told the VIPs to enjoy the Blind Taste Test movie on YouTube, with Felix wondering if the VIPs would react as a live stream on YouTube. Once everything was settled, head chef Maggie announced that their next challenge was the annual Blind Taste Test. The sous chefs Alan and Caitlin reveal the punishment booths, and Hannelore said she had waited for that challenge since she entered the competition. In contrast, Tristan knew how big the challenge was as it separated the cooks from the chefs. Head Chef Maggie explained that while one chef tasted the Japanese fruits and vegetables she fed them, before adding that you must say it in Japanese. Anyone caught saying this in English or another language would automatically get a punishment treatment. Lastly, their teammate would sit in the punishment booth as the sous chefs Alan and Caitlin would dump different types of sodas over their heads. For one incorrect ingredient, the chefs would get their heads dumped by Fanta Melon. For two incorrect ingredients, the chefs would get their heads dumped with Fanta Grape. Three incorrect ingredients would have the chefs get Fanta Orange dumped on them, and four incorrect ingredients featured Fanta White Peach. This shockingly surprises the chefs, while much to the VIPs’ amusement.

Sarah and Brian began the challenge as Justine and Hannelore sat in the punishment area. Brian dreaded going first, but he knew it had to be done. Brian got Ichigo, Ringo, Tamanegi, and Jagaimo, resulting Justine being clean. Then, Sarah got all incorrect by saying in French, resulting in Hannelore getting all four punishments, and the blue team led 4-0. This made the VIPs feel overjoyed, after seeing the punishments that the chefs received.

For the second round, Justine got Budou, Suika, Ninjin, and Nasu. This made Brian happy and kept clean as she knows all about fruits and vegetables. Next, Hannelore got nothing correct by speaking in German. Ultimately, Sarah received all four punishments. The score became 8-0 for the blue team. The VIPs reacted funny to see the chefs receive punishments.

In the third round, Felix got Nashi, Mikan, and Daikon, except Kyabetsu, which the latter mistook for lettuce. This resulted in Tristan getting the Fanta Melon punishment. Patricia only got Mikan, and Irene got the Fanta Melon, Fanta Grape, and Fanta Orange punishment, and the score was 11-1 for the blue team. The VIPs saw the mess after the wrong answers for the contestants, feeling the entertainment.

Before moving on to the final round, head chef Maggie announced that the blue team is dominating in team challenges, and has a chance to win for a reward. Brian felt good as the blue team was back on track and restoring morale. Tristan only got Momo, resulting in Felix getting the Fanta Melon, Fanta Grape, and Fanta Orange punishment. Unfortunately, Irene got it all incorrect. Patricia got all four punishments, and the blue team won the challenge 12-1. After getting all four punishments, Patricia annoyingly claimed that the red team is not good at team challenges and dinner services. Head Chef Maggie thanked the VIPs for enjoying the punishments that the chefs received and watching the movie of Blind Taste Test. The VIPs left happily with a full joyfulness and headed off.

Reward: The blue team receives 2,035 yen each for four individuals. However, head chef Maggie combined it into 8,140 yen, allowing them to buy expensive items. They were also rewarded with a trip to Shibuya Parco shopping mall. The group briefly discussed what place to go for the mall, and ultimately decided on Pokémon Center Shibuya, which the group agreed with. During the reward, Brian was happy to buy a Large Sceptile Poké Plush with his 5,000 yen, while Tristan looked around and saw the collection of keychains, pins, trading card game booster packs, snacks, and candies. Felix added that we need to save money for lunch as Justine realized that the group must follow the budget, respecting Tristan’s decision as he is just looking around curiously. However, Felix wanted to buy a box of cookies and chocolates for 2,000 yen. The group was also forced to add tax, much to their dismay, but still felt they enjoyed the reward. Brian agreed with him, and the group has 440 yen left for lunch. After collecting items, the group headed to FamilyMart for lunch with 440 yen remaining.

At FamilyMart, the group wanted to buy a delicious lunch. Before that, Maître d'hôtel Sadie gave the group extra 4,560 yen. This adds up to 5,000 yen total, so they can have enough money to buy expensive items. Maître d'hôtel Sadie headed back to Hell’s Kitchen restaurant afterwards. While shopping at FamilyMart, the group knew what to buy. Felix bought Tonkatsu Bento, Iced Green Tea, and Soufflé Pudding. Tristan bought Karaage Bento, Iced Coffee, and Double Cream Puff. Justine bought Tuna Mayo Onigiri, Grilled Salmon Onigiri, Bottled Oolong Tea, and Strawberry Crepe. Brian bought Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, Famichiki (Fried Chicken), Japanese Juice, and Mochi Ice Cream. Brian said this is a perfect budget, spending 4,880 yen total. That leaves 120 yen to spare so they can donate for the Private Dinner Service to welcome foreigners who want to live in Japan as permanent residents. After that, the group headed to the picnic spot named Shinjuku Gyoen, to relax and enjoy lunch.

At Shinjuku Gyoen for picnic spots, the group sat down with a large picnic size to fit 5 people, with head chef Maggie joining the group. But suddenly, she changed into her MasterChef The Remake personality with her sweet, kind, flirty, playful, humorous, lovely, cute, and giggly personality. During this time, she mentioned the cherry blossoms. While the blue team is eating lunch, head chef Maggie started to feel more happy and joyful as she also brought Japanese fruits and vegetables from the Blind Taste Test. She started to laugh, as the group started to feel more happy about the reward. After lunch, the group cleaned up and unexpectedly, head chef Maggie took her shoes off, and she found it funny as she wanted the blue team to take pictures of her. After that, the group had a lot of fun, and planned to head back to Hell’s Kitchen restaurant.

Punishment: The women were punished by cleaning up the dining room ahead of Charity Night. During the punishment, Sarah lamented missing out on a reward, as the red team kept losing team challenges and this is the eighth time that the red team lost. As the blue team walked by, Tristan sarcastically asked for a Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste on the Private Dinner Service menu when they finished. In response, Patricia deprecatingly warned the blue team that they would do something to get the men out of the competition.

While the punishment continues, Irene feels disappointed that the red team is still having low morale. Hannelore was stressed out about the upcoming Private Dinner Service. She knew that the entire red team was weak except Sarah. Patricia wanted her teammates to get through the punishment as the Private Dinner Service was on the way.

Meanwhile, at 2:30 PM, Gordon Ramsay from his high-tech surveillance vehicle arrives in Tokyo, locating the Hell’s Kitchen restaurant. He receives information about a potential Private Dinner Service from Maître d'hôtel Sadie, who was already back at the restaurant. He came back in and chatted with Maître d'hôtel Sadie about the chefs taking responsibility to lead their own courses tonight and serve the special guests who are foreigners who want to live in Japan as permanent residents. She agreed with him, and the red team finished the punishment. Gordon Ramsay provides details from Maître d'hôtel Sadie on the problems plaguing the establishment, such as toxic work environments for the hostile red team except Sarah, which deemed the latter the best chef on the worst red team, and failing to meet high standards during dinner service. After that, the blue team and head chef Maggie returned from the reward to get settled for the Private Dinner Service.

Before Service: Later that day at 5:05 PM, both teams received lessons from the sous chefs Alan and Caitlin about the menu items for Charity Night. Patricia said that Charity Night meant a lot to her as she was ready to give back to people who helped in their daily lives. Once the prep was finished, head chef Maggie had both teams lined up and told them the charities they were cooking for the two MasterChef The Remake contestants. The blue team would cook for The Housing Tour For Foreigners hosted by Elias Lundgren, which Brian liked as he knew how much the organization did for the community for foreigners. The red team would cook for the Japan Updates Weekly hosted by Raquel Serrano, which became impressive for Irene as she continues to be a content creator. Head Chef Maggie added that each chef would be responsible for leading their own course and supervising the cooking of their dishes. However, before anything happens, head chef Maggie received a phone call from head chef Lola and she said the two-strike policy is happening right now because there are a lot of bad private dinner services in the past. She also warned both teams that if a team gets made mishaps or mistakes twice, the entire team would be kicked out of the kitchen. She warned both teams to follow high standards and complete the private dinner service with a limited amount of mistakes. Then, head chef Maggie donated 120 yen for the Private Dinner Service to welcome foreigners who want to live in Japan as permanent residents. Finally, head chef Maggie told them to own their courses before asking Maître d'hôtel Sadie to open Hell’s Kitchen.

Dinner Service: Foreigners are expecting to dine at Hell's Kitchen restaurant in Tokyo tonight. This also features several MasterChef The Remake contestants. Aside from Elias Lundgren and Raquel Serrano, Ross Okafor, Pauline Chevallart, Logan Pritchard, and Jacqui Stonemont were seen dining that night. The menu for Charity Night featured Miso Glazed Scallops led by Sarah and Brian, Japanese Mushroom Risotto led by Irene and Tristan, Japanese Salmon with Mirin and Soy Sauce led by Patricia and Justine, and Wagyu Steak led by Hannelore and Felix. Also, everyone was responsible for the Japanese Souffle Pancakes. Head Chef Maggie called Sarah and Brian to the front of the pass, and both agreed to be ready in 4 minutes. In the red kitchen, Sarah was ready to lead the women on her first course, and she said it should be plain and simple as cooking scallops doesn’t take too long, searing each side in two minutes. In the blue kitchen, Brian got the scallops out, searing each side in two minutes. It was accepted. Back in the red kitchen, Sarah brought the scallops on time, and it was accepted as well. As the blue team plated their scallops at the pass, head chef Maggie loved the sear of the scallops, and more were sent to foreigners. Also, Sarah got her first course out to foreigners as well.

In the second course, head chef Maggie told Irene and Tristan to get their risotto ready in eight minutes. Tristan is confident that he has something in his mind. He wanted to add Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste on the risotto. In the red kitchen, Irene got her risotto out, but it was unsanitary with uncleaned mushrooms. This causes head chef Maggie to snap, and she enragedly tells the red team that this is not how to serve in a restaurant and it doesn’t meet high standards. This resulted in a red team getting a first strike. She warned the red team if you get one more strike, you’re thrown out of the kitchen. Meanwhile, in the high-tech surveillance vehicle, Gordon Ramsay uses the hidden cameras and other surveillance equipment to observe the contestants and staff in the restaurant's during dinner service from the outside. He shockingly described the progress of dinner service as the red team got the first strike and potentially facing disqualification, while the blue team is about getting the first strike. In the blue kitchen, Tristan went through the risotto he was sent, but head chef Maggie saw that they were covered with Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste and deemed unacceptable. Head Chef Maggie furiously demanded Tristan where did you get that and where it came from, but the latter had no idea where it came from. Head Chef Maggie threatened to disqualify the entire blue team as she continued to demand answers from Tristan. Tristan thought he was starting to get worried, especially from his teammates, as head chef Maggie was getting frustrated by Tristan's inability to answer a question from her. She gave the blue team the first strike and impatiently warned the blue team that if they got another strike, the entire blue team would be kicked out of the kitchen. She angrily reminded the blue team to get your heads in the game. Head Chef Maggie forced sous chef Alan to redo the risotto, much to Tristan’s embarrassment. Eventually, Tristan’s renewed risotto were accepted, and sous chef Alan helped Tristan serve his course.

As Patricia and Justine began the third course for salmon, and expected to be out to the pass for 8 minutes. In the red kitchen, Patricia is ready for the salmon and sends it to pass. However, it turned out to be soggy and drenched with soy sauce, much to head chef Maggie’s anger. This causes head chef Maggie to reach the boiling point. As a result, the red team got the second strike. She threw the entire red team out of the kitchen and forced them to nominate two people for elimination. Meanwhile, back in the high-tech surveillance vehicle, Gordon Ramsay uses the hidden cameras and other surveillance equipment to observe the incident for the red team during Private Dinner Service from the outside. He realized that the red team was already thrown out of the kitchen, and he had to leave immediately to step into the restaurant and investigate the situation. Back in the blue kitchen, Justine got the salmon to the pass, and it was acceptable with excellent plating skills and perfect sear. After Gordon Ramsay arrives at the restaurant, he forces sous chef Caitlin to switch all kitchen appliances, stovetop, and cookware off for the red kitchen and tells Maître d'hôtel Sadie to stop taking orders for the red kitchen. Eventually, the blue team served the third course to high praise from foreigners.

For the fourth course, head chef Maggie reminded Felix that steak must be medium-rare as she wanted to focus on quality. With eight minutes on the window, Felix finished the sear on the blue team’s steak, and accidentally sliced it early, which caused blood to leak and concerned his teammates. This upsets head chef Maggie as she goes down to her knees, and she has had enough as she said she cannot take it anymore, crying. As a result, she walked out of the restaurant with sous chefs Alan and Caitlin. After that, Gordon Ramsay angrily stopped all customers and foreigners eating right now. He also furiously stopped the blue team from cooking right now and forced them to switch all kitchen appliances, stovetop, and cookware off. He realized that the steaks are ice cold raw and potentially send someone to the hospital. Felix felt upset about his mishap performance, and he explained to Gordon Ramsay that he didn’t mean to poison the customers and foreigners. Also, Gordon Ramsay tells Maître d'hôtel Sadie to stop taking orders for the blue kitchen. After seeing what was happening, the blue team got the second strike. He kicked the entire blue team out of the kitchen and ordered them to nominate two people for elimination, after furiously describing it as one of the worst private dinner services for charity night in the show’s history. After that, he forced Maître d'hôtel Sadie to tell all customers and foreigners to leave and shut down the restaurant, ending the private night dinner service prematurely and the final course for everyone isn’t happening at all.

Post-Mortem: Back at the dorms for the red team, and during deliberation, Sarah called it hard to pick two people out of four. However, Hannelore felt that Patricia and Irene should be nominated for having soggy salmon and unsanitary risotto. Still, Patricia did not appreciate the comments as she thought she was one of the strongest on the red team. When Irene asked about her performance, Sarah said that she didn’t know that the risotto had uncleaned mushrooms in it. Although Irene felt that it was only a mishap, Sarah disagreed.

Meanwhile, for the blue team, Justine deemed Felix and Tristan the weakest chefs of the blue team that night, but Felix acknowledges that he unintentionally served ice cold raw steaks to the pass. Tristan said he wanted to add Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste on the risotto for fusion cuisine and felt he wasn’t sabotaging anyone. As Brian felt that it wasn’t meeting with high standards, he asked them how the risotto with Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste and raw ice cold steak came to be. Tristan said that Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste is a main ingredient to enhance the dishes and it was his favorite thing to do. When Justine voted for Tristan and Felix for nomination, they started to explosively clash with each other about their poor performances and blaming Gordon Ramsay for kicking everyone out of the kitchen and turning into “secret service and kitchen nightmares combination scenario”. However, Brian was too frustrated to argue with them, and he wanted to forget it and move on.

Meanwhile, Gordon Ramsay is seen helping head chef Maggie cleaning up the dining room and setting up for the elimination ceremony. She thanked him for her help. After that, he left the restaurant, headed back to his high-tech surveillance vehicle, and drove away.

Elimination: After both teams came downstairs, head chef Maggie said that Charity Night services were always a tradition in the competition as it gave her a glimpse of who could lead. However, according to Gordon Ramsay, she infuriatingly described it as one of the worst private dinner services for charity night in the show’s history. She also furiously added that this the second consecutive time that you made me and sous chefs Alan and Caitlin walk out of the restaurant, before calling both teams extremely embarrassing. For the blue team, Justine was randomly assigned to announce the nominees. Justine announced Tristan as the blue team's first nominee for serving risotto with Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste that doesn’t meet standards and sabotaging his teammates, and Felix as the second nominee for serving ice cold raw steaks and potentially sending someone to the hospital. For the red team, Sarah was randomly assigned to announce the nominees. Sarah announced Patricia as the red team's first nominee for serving soggy salmon and drenched with soy sauce, and Irene as the second nominee for serving unsanitary risotto with uncleaned mushrooms. During their pleas, Tristan admitted that he was following standards, and has no intention to sabotage his teammates. However, head chef Maggie enragedly said you are thin ice several times throughout the competition and added you are lying to me. The latter replied that he was adding Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste as a secret ingredient on the risotto for foreigners and customers to give a try and didn’t mean to make them sick, while Felix acknowledged that it was one of the worst performances so far in the competition. He said it was an accident. He doesn’t want to serve raw steak again and slice it early. He should rest the steak properly before slicing it. He wanted to stay for another chance. Then, Patricia tried her best to be a leader for the salmon course and become one of the strongest on the red team. She added that she wants the men to be gone so they will not get the black jackets, while Irene said being nominated for the second time in a row wasn’t a big deal. She wanted to get another chance to stay as she wanted to see Felix and Tristan eliminated. She will not make more mistakes again.

Head Chef Maggie rudely asked Tristan why he was up for elimination for the fourth time and sabotaging his teammates again, and the latter thought it was his idea to create a fusion dish for a charity night. However, head chef Maggie angrily reminded Tristan that she wanted him to follow standards, and she had seen enough of his horrendous performance. After facing a tough decision, head chef Maggie eliminated Tristan for serving risotto with Hell’s Kitchen Chili Paste that doesn’t meet standards, sabotaging his teammates, being on a downward spiral, and his declining performances. Before leaving, head chef Maggie praised Tristan for his creativity and being passionate for Thai cuisine, before she informed him to tell his wife about what happened to everything so far in the competition. During his exit interview, Tristan was disappointed about being eliminated. He said he was following standards and he didn’t mean to sabotage his teammates. However, he is going to miss his friends and hopes to see Brian to win the entire competition.

After Tristan left, head chef Maggie said she was not done and announced that the next person would be leaving from the competition, and she eliminated Felix for serving ice cold raw steaks, being the main setback for the blue team, being the main reason why the blue team got kicked out, and causing the blue team didn’t finish the private night dinner service. Before leaving, head chef Maggie told Felix that you have a lot of friends out of the competition, keep cooking, and be very successful, and the latter thanked her for the opportunity. During his exit interview, Felix was proud of himself that he made it to the top 7 and head chef Maggie told him that you have a lot of friends out of the competition. He acknowledged that serving ice cold raw steaks during the private night dinner service got the best of him. He added that he would love to see Brian to win the entire competition.

After Felix left, head chef Maggie told the remaining chefs that the competition was wide open for anyone and said we’re nearly close to approaching the black jacket phase. She confirmed that head chef Lola is expected to return to work at Hell’s Kitchen restaurant tomorrow, much to everyone’s excitement. However, Maître d'hôtel Kim, sous chefs Jake and Mary are not back from their vacation yet. Next, she added that the Black Jackets Challenge would be done during the team phase. Then, she infuriatingly warned both teams that I am not going to tolerate like that ever again. She frustratingly said that this is what happens if both teams turned a special event dinner service into secret service and kitchen nightmares combination scenario. Also, she furiously added that things are turning up the heat as there were six chefs remaining. Finally, head chef Maggie dismissed the chefs. While being dismissed, Patricia was arrogantly glad that Tristan and Felix were eliminated. She claimed that the men didn't deserve the black jackets and planned to get Brian eliminated as a threat. However, she is still furious that Brian is still here and wants to see Brian not to get a black jacket. Then, Brian annoyingly commented that he was the last male chef left in the competition before calling living with Justine, Sarah, and the Three Hell’s Ladies alliance to be rough. Lastly, Irene was enraged that Brian is still in the competition. She hopes to see Brian not earning the black jacket, as she wanted all women in the black jackets.

Head Chef Maggie's comment: ""Tristan's chili paste sabotaged his team, and Felix's raw steak was dangerous. Both of them are not ready to lead in my kitchen.""

1njwitw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njwitw/how_do_i_27f_fix_a_problematic_relationship_with/,How do I (27F) fix a problematic relationship with Fiancé’s (25M) best friend’s girlfriend,"For ease of reading I will dub the best friend’s name as John and his girlfriend as Jane.

I’ve been with my fiancé for over 5 years now and there is a problem that keeps reoccurring over and over again. This situation is messy for no reason.

John has cheated on Jane before which has caused a bit of insecurity on Jane’s part. My fiancé has never cheated on me but I’ve been cheated on before (the other girl being my past best friend) so as much as I wish I were more mature I do have some insecurity on my part. I find Jane incredibly over-the-top gorgeous. She is cool, we have so many things in common, and truly I would love to actually hang out with her if this wasn’t some kind of situation. There is some kind of communicative ambiguity which has caused distance between me and this girl. We moved away and john has come to see us without Jane. John likes to talk a lot about everything when he’s drunk and told us she felt uncomfortable with him coming here because of me. I try not to take that personally because I understand the trust in their relationship isn’t healed.

Let me state the obvious that I want nothing to do with her boyfriend like that.

He will get blasted drunk when he’s here and talk to me incessantly (I do think it’s innocent). It makes me uncomfortable because I want zero reason for her to feel insecure. I have literally broken up relationships if guys talk to me with a girlfriend. I literally go and tell the girl. After what happened to me like no, I would never do that to another girl. He’s actually asked for relationship advice with her and I’ve always stood up for her feelings and told him to imagine being in her shoes. I just don’t think she knows that. She is so incredibly quiet all of the time and that leaves a lot of room for me to feel uncomfortable being around her. Not only that, but when his friends are here (there’s another guy that comes) I don’t want to necessarily sit there and say absolutely nothing like she does, and I feel like me talking to all of them like I do bothers her in some way? I don’t know. It just feels like there’s so much tension there.

Then an incident happened last time they all came to stay here where my fiance was talking to her. A lot. I’m not saying he was getting at anything right in front of me but it made me feel insecure. He’s liked old old pictures of her on Instagram (like 8 year old pics probably) I’m definitely not perfect and I regret it but I just kinda lost it because it felt like she was feeding into it because she doesn’t like how much John talks to me. This is all hypothetical it was just how I felt. After breaking down to him, My fiance was just saying how she never talks and he wanted to make her feel more comfortable and that “when she talks to me I barely respond” which was a shock because I sincerely want this to be okay. The whole rest of their trip I just wanted to hide in my room and do nothing with the group since it felt like everything was collapsing inside of me. I couldn’t do anything right.

I’ve had lots of conversations with my fiancé. He’s not okay with me just not engaging with his friends when they come over and hiding away the whole time. This girl is gonna be at our wedding and he says I’m older than her so it’s up to me to make this work because that’s his best friend and she’s not going away.

So I was gonna sit down and talk to her some night when we’re drunk (we actually get along SO WELL when we are both drunk and it’s always disappointing and sad when I wake up sober and it’s the same). I basically was going to say hey I don’t want this to be awkward, I don’t know why it is but it is. I would love it if when you guys come down we can just do girl stuff together instead of feeling like we can’t go hang out. Then I felt like this is really cringy. Would probably make her uncomfortable. So my next plan is when they come down I just invite her to go get coffee and sweep this all under the rug and try to get closer with her. We hung out before and it was honestly so awkward. Before I write any more does anyone have any suggestions at all what I can do to feel less uncomfortable in the presence of this girl?!

TL;DR Fiancé’s best friend’s girlfriend has trust issues and so do I. How can I break the ice with her after 5 years of not being able to?",2,1758162467.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False
1njwi62,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicFriends/comments/1njwi62/she_was_the_leader_of_our_group_kicked_me_out/,"She was the leader of our group, kicked me out during covid, and still believes she’s in the right","So get ready for a LONG one bc this is so wild 

So back in 2018-2019, i met a girl named D. we were in a sorority together and we became really good friends and became pretty much inseparable. she was known as the “cool girl” that EVERYONE wanted to be friends with and at first i didn’t see any red flags bc i was straight out of high school, wanted to make friends, and i looked up to her bc she had this natural charisma. 

Time passes and we end up creating our own little friend group w 4 other girls and we were known in our sorority as the friend group that other people wanted to one day have friends like. we were all super close, did everything together, always there for each other, etc. we were basically like those ideal friend groups from movies and tv shows. it was all super cool, chill and fun and not gonna lie i fell into the propaganda HARD. anytime she would talk shit about someone, i would also talk shit bc i believed it was her venting about someone who did her dirty and i wanted her to feel validated. 

 Well, time passed and we ended up transferring to a different university all at the same time (the same university) and we did so not just to stay together but bc the school overall was just better. D had moved in with another girl in our sorority and they were roommates for a while. but all of a sudden she made her roommate super uncomfortable and she ended up moving out which flew RIGHT over my head at the time but looking back, D was definitely the problem. anyway, this gave open space for me and our other friend N to move in together and it was all chill! 

But THIS is when shit started to spiral. 

first few months living together were perfect but then going into sept/oct of 2020 (i can’t remember the exact date) shit started going south. i would notice that both D and N would be acting weird, standoffish, and they did tell me they didn’t like that i didn’t clean immediately after myself or forget to take out the trash which totally fair and i took full accountability for it. i was working 2 jobs at the time and had very little time for resting and actually being able to do the chores but i fixed it as soon as they called it out and apologized. 

There was one day they both were making plans in front of me and it made me feel some type of way bc they planned to go out for ice cream in front of me and didn’t invite me. i brought this up to them and their excuse was “oh we just needed space away from you” and when i asked them why and what i could do to fix it to not make them uncomfortable they couldn’t give me a straight answer. 

when it came to anything about my past relationships D would tell me to get over it and it’s in the past and she was tired of hearing about it but when D or N talked about their past relationship they would console each other and support one another and that made me feel really upset. Not to mention if D or N talked bad about someone to something they called it venting but when i did it i was being a crybaby and talking shit. the double standard was insane honestly.  

then comes when D did my best friends hair (she was a stylist) and i helped my best friend schedule her appointment and it was set at 9am at our apartment. I did my part of waking up at 6am driving an hour to pick up my BF then driving another hour back to my apartment, giving me and my bestie an hour to get coffee / breakfast. when we arrive at the apartment D is still asleep. i told my friend it was bc she had gone to a party the night before so maybe she’s tired and my friend said she was cool with it because we could just chill. Eventually FOUR HOURS pass… and D is finally ready to start my friends hair. throughout the entire appointment D was just rude, silent, not talking, etc. despite being open and talkative with all her other clients. during the appointment i had invited my other friend over and D said she was fine with it bc she also always has friends over and it’s both our apartment so I ran it by her and she agreed. my other friend gets there and we start chatting it up. me, my best friend, and my other friend have all known each other since high school so we were talking about HS and just people we knew and D was acting standoffish and weird and i didn’t think anything of it. a few hours pass and it’s like 12am-1am and my best friend is like falling asleep in the chair because D has just taken forever to do her hair. she was taking breaks non stop, went to the gas station to get a lighter, not to mention showed up FOUR HOURS late to the appointment and my BF had been awake since 6am so she was exhausted. she finally told D “look you’re fine with 90% of my hair, i’ll pay you the full amount but i’m just so exhausted” and D got irritated by that and told her that she would only make her pay half the total cost and that it was fine. and i could tell she was irritated bc of the look on her face. 

I found out the truth of how D felt about me when I was looking for my phone in the apartment and I grabbed our other roommates phone on accident bc we had the exact same phone and clear case. I saw ALLLL the text messages of them talking shit about me. D texting N calling me and my friends losers and trolls for talking about high school, D telling N i was annoying bc i didn’t give her a ride to work (she asked me to take her 10 minutes before the shift started and i was dead asleep), purposely making trips and conducting ways to do it in front of me, etc etc. I was baffled but I didn’t get to see the full extent of everything. 

It wasn’t until me and D went on a trip together and I knew i needed to get closure. so i looked through D’s phone. i know that was probably the most toxic thing i’ve done but i needed proof that they were actually talking shit about me and when i read the messages in totality i knew they were not my friends. esp seeing texts of them talking bad about my best friends when they were the one being rude to her. 

Then i had my bday party. long story short they got me plastered because they hyped me up to taking shots for my bday and smoking weed. i was literally wasted and i couldn’t stand up and instead of helping me, D just said “you need to get up bc im not gonna sit here and baby you while you’re drunk” and j literally couldn’t move so she left me there on the floor passed out and left. it hurt really bad especially bc for our other friends bday when she got drunk D was there consoling her, sitting with her, helped her change into comfy clothes, etc. but didn’t do anything like that with me. Found out later on that they only wanted to come to my bday party bc i bought all the alcohol but said they wish they would’ve gone to a frat party instead. not to mention they tried to get strangers to take me to bars so that they wouldn’t have to take care of me. 

I started to notice all the ways that D would give me silent treatment if i disagreed with her or didn’t give her rides places, she would ignore me when i asked her questions, expect me to apologize for HER wrongs, and eventually she started getting the whole friend group against me. 

After that trip I realized they were not real friends and i started to treat them the same way they treated me. if they did something wrong and expected me to apologize, i refused. if they got mad at me for not giving them rides i ignored them, i gave the same energy back and D acted like I just said the most offensive thing ever. 
She did NOT like that whatsoever and started getting the whole friend group against me even more. 

One of our friends planned an ice skating thing for her bday and she said all the group could go and D quickly said “Actually it’s only going to be 4 instead of 5” and uninvited me from someone else’s bday event. later on, they ended up going and that friend just agreed with D. that same day D texted me and told me that if “i wasn’t being so weird maybe i wouldn’t have gotten uninvited” which is funny bc I was invited until she took the liberty to uninvite me from someone else’s event. I called her out and told her she was manipulative and toxic and that no wonder her old roommate moved out and that all her friends end up dropping her bc of the way she treats them. she did NOT like that and started trying to flip the script and act like i was the problem and said “you’re playing victim and it’s not cute. it’s manipulative” and in my head i’m like “how can i play victim and be manipulative when i am the victim of your terrible behavior?”

it spiraled and snowballed into something worse. I ended up isolating myself in my bedroom when she was home, didn’t talk to her if she was in the same room, would check her location to make sure i could be home freely without her being rude to me. it was a mental torture game and she did everything in her power to make sure the entire friend group stopped talking to me. she 1000% had the mind set of “if i don’t like someone then my friends can’t like them” and since the rest of the group was under her spell and her little puppets they all obeyed like little puppies. not a single ounce of individuality in that friend group. 

come christmas time, i found out my family (who are autoimmune compromised) got covid. i was scared and had made a post in instagram asking to keep them in peoples thoughts for safety. not even 20 minutes later D texts me telling me she’s sorry about my family but I had 5 days to move out and find somewhere else to live or they would call the cops. i told her it was christmas and there was literally no where for me to go because landlords probably aren’t paying attention to people looking for homes and dorms are closed and she told me it wasn’t her issue and to figure it out. 

i was stressed to say the least but i managed to find a room in a house pretty quickly since i spent every hour of everyday scouring facebook market. as i was moving out i went to take my things with me and me and N shared a room and had bunk beds. i took them apart because one of the beds was rightfully mine since we paid half and half. D like the little vindictive snake she is, called N’s MOM and told her i was stealing the bed and that the cops would be called. i told D i would talk to N when she got to the apartment from work and D gave my number to N’s mom who later texted me saying she would sue me if i took anything from the apartment i didn’t pay for but i literally paid for the bed. 

N arrived later and we talked and suddenly she wanted to play this “i didn’t know” victim role when i called her out for talking shit about me and my friends. i told her how would she feel if someone talked shit about her best friend and she agreed she wouldn’t like it and i basically made her feel stupid for just following along everything D said and not having any sort of thinking for herself. 

I eventually ended up moving out and disconnect from everyone and everything having to do with them. I found out that D went around and told the whole world a whole fabricated story about how i was the problem and i was the bad guy, and i lost all my friends and everyone believed her bc she was more “likeable”. 

i ended up living in my car for a few days bc i had no where to go and lost all my friends, couldn’t go home bc my entire family had COVID and i was living off my last paycheck to make ends meet. i struggled a lot and this isn’t even the full extent of what D and that friend group did to me that was so vile and manipulative and abusive.

D truly was nothing but an abusive, manipulative, toxic, peaked in high school bully and mean girl. she needed to be the center of attention always and be the “leader” of every group she was apart of. if i found other friends she got mad at me and jealous for not being with her. she talked shit ahí it people she didn’t know and was NEVER happy about any of the success i had in life. 

now it’s been 5 years and D has texted countless times asking to be my friend again, not taking any accountability when bringing up what happened between us, giving half ass apologies, saying she loves and misses me and constantly stalks my instagram and tiktok accounts. N stalks my accounts too and she’s gone so downhill, started dating a cheater and dropped out of school… not good. 

i think it’s funny seeing how the girl everyone thought was this cool, popular, everyone likes her type of deal is begging for my friendship when she swore she didn’t need me in her life. but im glad i blocked her and don’t pay her mind. 

i’ve graduated with my masters, lived in my dream city for three years, am engaged, well traveled, and have the life i have always wanted meanwhile she is still the same mean girl as ever. maybe she’s changed but she will never be a good person to me. it surprises me how she has so many people fooled that she’s a good person when she’s not.

After picking up a passenger, I was prompted to enter a pin. First time for me, but seemed pretty straightforward. I asked them for them for the pin, they provided it and I entered it.

Immediately after entering the pin the “Start Wait and Save” option you have to slide appeared at the bottom. I slide it to the right as usual and it immediately appeared as if the ride ended. Rate the passenger prompt appeared on the screen, all navigation was gone.

Doing what I know to do when I ride ends, I instructed them they had to exit the vehicle. After a bit of confusion on both of our parts and some back and forth, the passenger showed me their phone and it showed they were still on the ride. So I ended up opening Ways and manually entering the destination. I figured maybe when I get there it’ll correct itself.

Once I had my destination set in Ways, I swapped back over to the Uber Driver app, and attempted to hit the Coffee Cup icon which prompted me with “doing so will cancel the ride” so I cancelled the Coffee Cup icon action and everything came back.

She was very chatty and we ended up spending a pretty long time together. I noticed, however, that she mostly talked about herself. Her family, work, friends, interests, home. I was asking and listening, but it began to feel one sided and like she wasn't listening to me when I'd speak on something in my own life. She also didn't ask much about me to get to know me.


I wonder if this is a sort of nervous behaviour and if I should even consider a second date, like maybe to gauge if this is her normal or if it was an anxious word vomit situation.


I would consider it a one and done, but she texted me relatively quickly afterwards to tell me how she enjoyed the time together and texted me like usual for a bit before I had to go. Admittedly, sometimes things get by me. I can't get a read on this situation.

Hi there, I had this idea for a while, and I think it could be pretty fun for me to play either sides of this. 

The plot is, there are people who are hybrids of animals that have existed for a long time alongside humans, they are shape shifters of sorts, that can go between a completely human look and a partially animal human look (think kemonomimi’s). Some people even worshiped them and said that they were true beings of nature, pure and instinctual.

That is until around 1980, when suddenly there was regulations on where the animal people could go, therefore, they had to create their own society, creating their own cities, towns, and animal human explicit areas. All animal people are to be killed on site if found within human borders.

They have created a term for these animal people, beastfolk.

All of this happened because of a presidential election, in which the Supreme Court voted to strip away beastfolk rights. all because of an incident with one in particular, who bit a human.

Now it is 2065, nothing has changed, except for hunters. There are people specifically hired to kill and hunt down beastfolk who may be hiding amongst them. they have futuristic weapons, and the upper hand most of the time.

One of us will be a hunter, and the other one will be a beastfolk. The beastfolk was a coworker of the hunter. Hunters main jobs are to blend in, so therefore they take on different jobs searching for targets. The hunters job currently is a barista job, the beastfolk is the owner of the coffee shop.

Eventually, the Hunter finds out that the coffee shop owner is a beastfolk, but not before they already became close friends.

It’s not adjustable, and Eureka doesn’t include a larger fork or a 58 mm adapter. Trying to use a 58 mm portafilter on the 54 mm fork leaves it loose and misaligned with the chute. I found this out the hard way after buying one and having to request an RMA from Seattle Coffee Gear. Neither Eureka nor SCG mention the portafilter size, which was frustrating — but at least it’s resolved now.

One more note: from a brand perspective, it feels misleading that they don’t disclose the machine is made in China. The Amazon listing still claims “Made in Italy,” SCG doesn’t specify the origin, and the box is covered in Italian text — except on the bottom of the machine, where it finally says “Made in PRC.”

First, two guys and I hit it off on Grindr simultaneously the week after July 4th. Slow chit chat, I ask for their numbers, we talk more via text. Guy 1 (23) seems excited to have a phone date before committing to an in-person date. Fine. He’s the one initiating the texts for the most part. But a week later, a half an hour before our call (we’d been pleasantly texting until that point) he blocks me on… everything. Okay.

Guy two (26) doesn’t block but flakes on texting after initiating every single conversation and picture exchange—I’m very thorough and engaging in replies but work from home and don’t check my phone until after lunch, and he got up way earlier. Also, we talked about some niche kinky stuff that he and I were both *very* into, which was cool, as well as general hobby crap. Then no responses for several days in a row. Then total phantom. Shrug.

Cut to mid-August. Guy three (26) messages me and is textually up my ass on Grindr. But he’s cute, cool, loves the same music/art/horror fondness. Great. We have a very lengthy phone conversation that goes great, then he apologizes for being nervous—I reassure him that I didn’t get that vibe at all, and even if so, I pride myself on being incredibly down to earth and easy to talk to. Not paraphrasing, he says: “you’re legitimately one of the most immediately kind people I’ve ever chatted with… certainly on a dating app. Thanks for being there for me :]” Then over the next week our conversation weans to less and less replies until I’m basically talking to a blank screen. But he doesn’t block me either. Lovely.

Two and a half weeks ago: guy number 4 (30) is messaging me the most engaging questions I’ve received in months, being incredibly flirty, confident, fun. (He originally offered his number, was extremely flattering and complimentary but not horny.) He’s in the process of moving to a new apartment so I say no worries—we can grab coffee when that’s through because everything about that process usually sucks. He apologizes anyway and says he can’t wait to talk to me soon. A week later I send a cute, short audio message regarding something funny we talked about and hoping the move goes well. No idea if he listened, but no response. Another week later I send a wave emoji and say hope there’s no snags in the move. Crickets.

Before any kinky interaction, you must prove you are of legal age through proof of Yoti! This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. If you refuse, you will be BLOCKED immediately.

⛓️My domination style is gentle yet harsh. I enjoy being in control of my subs, treating them sweetly but strictly. I get great satisfaction from ordering them what to do, knowing they obey and do it without question. I like humiliating them. I also enjoy mommy roleplay and SPH ✨ While we're playing, I really enjoy being provocative, knowing how much you crave my attention and earning it, begging for it.  If you become my subbie and disobey, you'll be punished for sure! But I can also be gentle with you and offer you a GFE ❤️ To verify the subbie's seriousness, I have an initial fee of $12 (will be charged in order to start the game, my Thorne link in my profile).

•Outside of the game, I'm a pretty outgoing and talkative person, so I can be friends too. Meeting people is amazing! I think it's important to have a prior conversation with the subbie before starting so I can learn about their tastes, limits, and mine. Let's agree so our bond can be enjoyable for both of us!

🌸More about me: I really like video games and anime, as well as Kdramas and romantic movies. I dance and I'm very passionate about it; it's very rewarding for me!  I really like coffee and pizza, and I prefer savory foods (although lately, red velvet cakes are my favorite dessert).

🌸I want to be adored and worshipped because I deserve to be, so content sales WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE (at least for now). If I post something, I'll do it because I feel like it and it will be about whatever I feel like...

###get your *ferritin* tested in *addition* to iron

Do you see this??? Do you see how my iron says it’s in the normal range? The first batch of labs I got from my NP had all normal in range results for EVERYTHING. 

I sent it to my hematologist who ordered a lab with just ferritin and CBC. He ordered iron infusions for me ANYWAYS because he can just tell I WASN’T DOING OKAY. 

The results came back and I had a 10, and he told me to get my infusions ASAP (they were already ordered 🫩) 

DO YOU SEE HOW FUCKING LOW MY FERRITIN IS??? It was 10 last week. This week it’s an 8. As my colleague explained to me, “20 is the absolutely lowest acceptable amount. You have even BELOW that. How have you not passed out yet?” Hmmm, that’s a good question. My ferritin should not be as low as this.

Ferritin/iron affects your mental health amongst other things. Go get your goddamn ferritin checked. I beg!! Especially for my “coffee + adderall for breakfast” girlies!!!!!

If there’s spelling mistakes in here, truly sorry and I’m not even trying to be funny, it’s so hard to focus on text. But I gotta get this message out there 🫡


FYI: I am not a doctor. Just a girl with low ferritin and normal iron.

1njw142,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFJsOver30/comments/1njw142/infj_pick_your_brain_requests/,INFJ & “Pick Your Brain” requests,"Lately I’ve been learning more about being an INFJ, and one of the patterns I’ve noticed is how my desire to fit in has created some challenges for me socially and professionally. 

I’d like to have more friend relationships and in the past I think I’ve fallen for brain picking because of this but really the people don’t ever become friends. 

Mostly I feel people want to know me for my success (because I meet them at a professional event) Or I dim my success and ambitions to fit in with people in my area in the community but then they ultimately find out and the power dynamic shifts and I feel weird or like I’m not being included anymore and pushed out of groups because I have basically a second life going on. 

I have a small but tight following in a niche subject matter, and I pour countless hours (6–8 hours some days) into studying, learning, and building my business around it. 

Because of that, I’ve noticed people will often ask to “pick my brain.” Sometimes these are people I’ve known for a while, sometimes people I’ve just met. 

The goal to pick my brain always seems to be how to copy my business. Which is also ridiculous because the amount of work I put into it other people wouldn’t want to sacrifice. 

What feels draining is:
	•	They rarely engage with or support my work publicly (no likes, comments, or shares).
	•	They reach out for coffee chats or advice, but once I give it, they usually disappear.
	•	I end up feeling burned because I’m giving away insights that I know are valuable, but it shifts the power dynamic in a way I don’t like.

As INFJs we’re naturally empathetic and want to help, so part of me feels “called” to share. But I also recognize that I’m essentially giving away consulting for free (I don’t even want to charge, I don’t feel like doing it I’d rather do my work) — and it takes a lot of my energy and my time which is really valuable to me. 

I don’t know if this is an INFJ thing but I prefer to not book any appointments as much as possible because if I have even one or two errands to run a day I feel the day is lost. 

This has come up with specific requests on how I made a successful business and people just asking for “general advice for them” and now I realize I have instinctively known what to tell them because I’m an infj. I can map everything out before even having the date, my brain will process everything and I over share because I know the answer but this has made people more jealous. 

I’m also thinking the nature of my work is probably intriguing but I’m torn between wanting to share and not wanting to attract people. Due to the nature of my work I share unique opportunities and projects and because I have good taste in design I show somewhat luxury things because I appreciate them but I don’t think that’s helping my case. 

So wondering 
- Have other INFJs dealt with this? 
- How do you balance the desire to help with the need to protect your time and energy, especially when people don’t really support your work but still want access to your knowledge? 
- What is the best way to say no ? 
- Do you approach people coming to you with these requests in a spiritual way, that as INFJs our perspective is to be of service ? ",1,1758161023.0,INFJsOver30,0,1.0,False

1njvy6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1njvy6v/actual_spend_in_re_previous_12_month_vs_3_year/,Actual Spend in RE - Previous 12 month vs 3 year average,"**NOTE**: I should have made this clear. This isn't a question and it _is_ a wall of text. It really isn't just to browse now. It's more to reference from later posts throughout the year when people ask ""what's a typical spend in RE?"" I've done a series of these most every year and generally gets quite a bit of use throughout the year. If you're not interested now, just ignore it please. Others will find it useful later.

**NOTE 2:** Probably the most common question I get throughout the year is how are you fatFIRE and still get ACA subsidies? Some large part of it is explained by my expenses. My non-discretionary is well within 400% FPL when consider spend vs MAGI. Whether I can continue the discretionary spend if the cliff returns is really a function of my planning & execution.

---

As a topic of discussion/reference, this is my previous 12 month spend by category compared against the previous 3 year average. I use Quicken to track expenses. We are 57f/59m in an MCOL - retired in 2019. I would describe us as mostly frugal but willing to spend on a few lifestyle upgrades of particular value to us.

The spend represents maybe a 1.25%-1.75% SWR. I think a pertinent observation is that there is a certain baseline spend for a given COL. Here, I would say it's $70-80K with paid off home/cars and no debt.

I've provided my complete list of categories - also used for older parents. I wanted you to be able to see categories for future expenses and also categories I don't necessarily spend in but which you might use.

Having said that, I'm afraid that over the last 5 years I've become somewhat less frugal and inflation has made things quite a bit more expensive. Expenses last year were $175,533 which is up 29.3% over the $135,805 3 year average. The expenses are about $87,984 non-discretionary and $87,549 discretionary (50%/50%)

This doesn't tell the whole story. We have no debt/mortgage (on a 2019 home) and no debt on 2 2025 vehicles. We pay our charitable giving out of a DAF. If we include that and provide some amortization of home repair and vehicle replacement we'd probably have additional expenses close to the following.

| Description |  Amount  |
| --- | ---: |
| Amortized Vehicle 1 Replacement |  $10,000  |
| Amortized Vehicle 2 Replacement |  $14,000  |
| Amortized Home Maintenance |  $7,000  |
| Charitable (DAF) |  $20,000  |
| TOTAL |  $51,000 |

FWIW, this is a break down of income sources last year.

| Source | Percent |
| --- | ---: |
| Side Gig | 5% |
| Cash Back | 1% |
| Rental Income | 16% |
| Dividends | 17% |
| Realized Gains | 62% |

Notes:

* This is NOT a _Budget_. It's a sanity check.
* Last year's taxes were a little higher because of gains harvesting and roth conversions in anticipation of the ACA cliff returning.
* The negative state income tax is a reflection of property tax credits against our relatively high property taxes.
* Health insurance is ACA with subsidies. Keep in mind that spend is very distinct from income/MAGI.

Now for the categories.

Just had a virtual coffee chat from someone who was hoping for me to recommend them when a job opens up on my team (which will happen soon)

Going into the chat I was hoping to get a sense of why I should recommend him. My motivations are:
1. If he seems really great I can try and get a referral bonus
2. If I don't know enough about him by the end of the call I won't recommend him because I want my company to trust my recommendations going forward. So i wouldn't take the risk.

The problem was he only really asked questions about the interview process and what he should study for. So i didn't really learn anything about him and I have no idea if he is someone i should recommend or not.

From past coffee chats, here is what was wayyyy more helpful to me as someone who wants to help them
- started with an intro and wasn't afraid to brag 
- asked about what skills are most important to success on my team and brag about their experience with them or how they are working to build up that skill
- got into a technical discussion! Asked what types of problems we work on that are hardest to solve and gave their thoughts like you would if a coworker was talking through a problem with you. Even if you don't have the solution, you can still ask intelligent questions and show how your brain works

Overall I really appreciated when the person looking for work spoke more about themself and gave more insight into their skillset. Doesn't need to be the only focus of the whole call but failing to do so is a missed opportunity!! Help them help you lol",1,1758160669.0,ADHD_Programmers,0,1.0,False
1njvwa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1njvwa6/which_electric_kettle_is_best_for_my_daily_needs/,Which electric kettle is best for my daily needs?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission to find the perfect electric kettle for my daily tea and coffee rituals, and I thought I'd share my experience after trying out several options. Trust me, I've gone through the whole trial-and-error process so you don't have to!

After countless hours of research and actually using different models, I've discovered that the perfect electric kettle really depends on your specific needs. I personally need something that heats up quickly, has temperature control (because green tea at boiling temperature is just wrong!), and is durable enough to withstand multiple uses throughout the day.

I found this amazing selection of electric kettles here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle that really opened my eyes to what's available in the market. The variety is impressive, from basic models to ones with all the bells and whistles.

Here's what I've learned about choosing the right electric kettle:

1. Capacity Matters
For single users, a 1-1.5 liter kettle works great. But if you're like me and have a family of tea drinkers, go for something larger.

2. Material Choices
- Stainless steel is durable and maintains temperature well
- Glass looks beautiful but requires more maintenance
- Plastic is budget-friendly but may affect taste slightly

3. Must-Have Features
- Auto shut-off (absolute necessity for safety)
- Temperature control (game-changer for different beverages)
- Keep-warm function (super convenient)
- Quick boiling capability

4. Nice-to-Have Features
- Water level indicator
- 360-degree rotating base
- Filter for hard water areas
- Cool-touch exterior

One thing that really surprised me was how much energy efficient these newer models are. They heat water way faster than stovetop kettles and use less electricity too!

For those interested in exploring options, I'd highly recommend checking out this curated selection: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. They've got everything from budget-friendly basics to premium models with all the features I mentioned.

Quick Pro Tips:
- Clean your kettle regularly with vinegar solution
- Don't overfill past the max line
- Let it cool completely before storing
- Use filtered water if possible for better taste

I eventually settled on a gooseneck kettle with temperature control, which has been perfect for both my pour-over coffee and various types of tea. The precision pour and temperature settings have seriously upgraded my morning beverage game.

What's your experience with electric kettles? I'd love to hear what features you find most useful in your daily routine!",1,1758160654.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Very cute and seems like a kind person, albeit maybe an anxious person.


She was very chatty and we ended up spending a pretty long time together. I noticed, however, that she mostly talked about herself. Her family, work, friends, interests, home. I was asking and listening, but it began to feel one sided and like she wasn't listening to me when I'd speak on something in my own life. She also didn't ask much about me to get to know me.


I wonder if this is a sort of nervous behaviour and if I should even consider a second date, like maybe to gauge if this is her normal or if it was an anxious word vomit situation.


I would consider it a one and done, but she texted me relatively quickly afterwards to tell me how she enjoyed the time together and texted me like usual for a bit before I had to go. Admittedly, sometimes things get by me. I can't get a read on this situation.
I touched her arm and her knee to show interest at different times, lightly flirted, was curious and interested, paid for the coffees.

Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

however, ever since in the past, i always had this issue where majority of the people assume I am native korean, or to some degree, ""good enough that I should know better"".

whenever I ask them a question, they look and treat me like I just asked them how to launch a rocket to mars. As if they cant believe I dont know how to do it.

a very good example is at a PC bang last year, i visited it with my brother just for fun and to check it out. to ""sign up"", Pay, log in, etc was actually very complicated. and there were signs and steps on how to do it (i presume). to try to read and understand would take us quite a bit and end up us looking like we're loitering around and walking around confused. So we asked the person at the front desk, in Korean, what we have to do. They basically dismissed us and said ""just go up to that kiosk and follow the steps"".

so we just walked over to it and tried our best. confused as fuck. until about 3 min later when she realized we were not actually native koreans. and helped us from start to finish.

another example is when i first got the convenience store ice cup and coffee. i dont quite remember what confused me about it, it was something odd at that specific convenience store, but the store clerk was absolutely perplexed/confused that i didnt know how it works.

another would be the public transport system. bus driver was bewildered that I didnt know how to pay for X number of people with my card.

of course almost in all these scenarios, if they realize im a foreigner, (literally talking in english with my brother like in the PC bang scenario. although in others, it doesnt really come up early enough) they realize whats going on and are more forgiving. but if they dont realize im not a foreigner, it is just absolutely a painful interaction (They dont get why im confused on something so common knowledge. meanwhile i of course dont know what i dont know)

It is a bittersweet feeling. The 'sweetness' stems only from the fact that I feared today was actually the last day of warmth but to my delight, it seems tomorrow will be just as good.

I got quite a lot done today, with my writing and otherwise. Firstly, Darling called not long after I went outside. We spoke for a while and they told me that they would love to have some pears this year. Mother and I will drive over with some on Friday. I won't go into detail, but it was good hearing from them. After that, I got to writing. I struggled a little today with what angle to start writing from \[the first sentence between writing sessions is often a struggle\] but I am happy with what I ended up with. I wrote 789 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. I struggled again because the characters wrestled control from me and went off outline again. They went off the new outline that I wrote because of the first time they went off the outline. Now I need to write a third outline starting from where I left off. My characters are scheming little bastards, always tripping me down rabbit holes and running off with my map, I swear I can't take them anywhere.

When I was having trouble with my writing, I took a break to work on the garden. I replanted four our of seven of the plants we want to bring in. I don't remember what they are called but they're pretty little plants. Hopefully they do well over the winter.

After I came in for the day and had dinner, it was time to sort the pears. We prepared bundles for darling and everyone else we are giving them away to. Then I sorted through the rest. Threw out the completed rotted ones, put the slightly bad ones in a bag for the bunnies and deer, and rotated the good ones into new baskets. I can't be entirely sure but I think the wicker baskets have kept them in better conditions that the plastic containers we used to use. My arms ache but I am glad it is done. While I was doing that, Mother very kindly took care of my chores for me since it is garbage day. It's good we picked out the bad ones today so they'll be thrown out immediately.

I am quite tired as you may expect. I slept poorly last night, which didn't help. For some reason I kept jerking awake. No nightmares or loud noises \[though I did have an unpleasant dream about being back in school and having missed all my classes\] but it just kept happening. I woke up for the final time with a horrible headache but luckily it faded quickly after I dragged myself out of bed. I am very much hoping to avoid that fate tonight. For now, I am just going to enjoy me evening coffee & butter tart and try to do nothing for a few minutes. Wish me luck.

i didn’t really date much or make a lot of friends in college. i don’t do well on any dating app.
i was cheated on earlier this year. and then after that, every time i tried to ask someone out, one of the following things happened
> they didn’t feel a “spark”
> they ghosted
> they said “let’s be friends“
> they said “i’m not looking for a relationship“

im aware these are all different ways of saying the same thing: “no”. the thing is i dont understand. i try to be kind, genuine, emotionally available, funny, etc. i take care of my hygiene and my body. my friends or co workers get dates or get laid like you and i order coffee, so i know it can’t just be the world. i dont lack love for myself. im just at a point in my life where a serious romantic relationship is something that i really want and would make me happy

I’ve been curious about how coffee actually affects my blood pressure, so I decided to test it out this morning with my Omron monitor.
	•	Before coffee: ~101/76 (pulse 62)
	•	Right after finishing my coffee: ~116/87 (pulse 70)
	•	A bit later: readings around 109/84, 108/82

So it seems like my BP bumped up a little right after drinking, but then started settling back down.

I drink black coffee almost every morning, but this is the first time I’ve really tracked it step by step. I was surprised at how quick the change was.

Not conventionally beautiful, but I turned heads. Perimenopause has aged me 20 years in 4 years - no exaggeration. I HATE the way I look now. I don't recognise myself, and every time I see myself in a mirror or photo I feel depressed. I have always had a chubby face and slim body, now I have jowls, double chin, turkey neck, and a chunkier body for no lifestyle difference whatsoever. I look old. Instant old.

My eyebrows are invisible. My hair has thinned out and is all different textures. It now won't grow past my shoulders, and a lot of it is shorter than that in spite of zero haircuts and no dyes. So it's a permanent bad hair day. I don't want to cut it super short, as I did that a few years ago and hated it. And bob length just highlights my lower face.

My knee has some sort of bursitis, so regular exercise is hard. I walk the dog quite a long way when I can, but it's not consistent enough to make a difference. I can't afford a gym membership. I used to run and do yoga. My body always looked amazing. Now it doesn't seem to respond to exercise anymore. I'm permanently bigger.

I've also had to downgrade my skincare significantly due to financial hardship. I have four children that I am raising solo and without any support whatsoever. I literally cannot afford a cup of coffee after the bills are paid.

My eyelashes are now short and different lengths, too. And mascara now makes my eyes hurt and weep - it never used to!

What the heck can I do to help myself look and feel better on no budget, please?

I am already on HRT - Estradot 50.

I know it's superficial, and I don't even have a man in my life, but it's just such a lot to take in (and seems so unfair after years of stressful events). At the very least, I want to feel good about myself.

☕[Tip Jar](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I’ve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. Never expected, always appreciated ❣️ (P.S. if you’re having trouble getting to the “checkout” page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",18,1758158682.0,TwinCities,0,0.96,False
1njv7je,https://i.redd.it/1jhwxym9ptpf1.jpeg,Changes to the lineup and timetable groups as of September 2025,"September 2025 started with some changes to the WNL 16 casters' lineup:

\- **Riena Kobayashi** and **Senna Ogawa** moved from the morning programmes (Morning through Afternoon with some rare Evening/Moon shifts) to the **evening shows** (mainly from Afternoon through Moon).

\- **Mizuki Tokita** and **Yuiko Lisa Okamoto** now **rotate from Coffee Time through Moon** (before they were solidly presenting Evening and Moon with rare Afternoon rotations).

\- Both new casters (**Manaha Tanabe** and **Mao Matsumoto**) are at the morning group. 

The pic shows the current lineup as of September 2025 (thanks to our member u/ajisaidwahyudi):

\- **AM group**: Mayu, Momoka, Fukuyoshi, Manaha, Mao (Morning through Afternoon; Fukuyoshi mostly hosts Morning and Sunshine)

\- **PM group:** Airi, Yui, Riena, Senna (Afternoon through Moon); Mizuki, Yuiko Lisa (Coffee Time through Afternoon)

\- **Reserve/relief casters**: Sayane, Yukari, Kawabata (they fill gaps, mostly between Sunshine and Evening, when the main casters are unavailable for any reason)

\- **Maternity leave**: Ayaka, Nana

Another noticeable change is that, for unknown reasons, the live streams from early September 2025 onwards are made unlisted after their conclusion, but can be [accessed from this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVpbvf6f1taa3ryRw51HROYMragD6UuoP) at the official WNL channel (the links to the 6 daily streams, excluding the overnight one, are [posted on their ""Posts"" tab](https://www.youtube.com/@weathernews/posts)).",4,1758158676.0,WeatherNewsLive,0,1.0,False

Yawning every thirty seconds until tears are streaming down my face onto my jacket, unable to pay attention, and as I said, it becomes painful.

Been anemic for so long and just realized this might be the cause and also the factor that contributes to these severe caffeine crashes, even if it's just a cup of tea (which is all I drink
 Used to be coffee or energy drinks. Long while ago, when the yawning started, id lose the ability to stand and all of my strength, or even speak for half an hour or so).

1njuzok,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloggersCommunity/comments/1njuzok/recyclable_stand_up_pouch_a_sustainable_packaging/,Recyclable Stand Up Pouch: A Sustainable Packaging Innovation,"In today’s environmentally conscious market, businesses are increasingly seeking packaging solutions that balance functionality, sustainability, and consumer appeal. Among the many eco-friendly options available, the recyclable stand up pouch has emerged as a leading choice. This packaging format not only provides excellent product protection and branding opportunities but also supports sustainability initiatives by reducing waste and promoting recycling. As industries from food and beverages to cosmetics and pet care adopt these pouches, they are reshaping packaging standards and consumer expectations.

The primary advantage of recyclable stand up pouches lies in their eco-friendly design. Traditional flexible packaging often uses multiple layers of mixed plastics, making recycling a challenge. Recyclable stand up pouches, however, are manufactured with mono-materials such as polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP). These materials allow the pouch to enter existing recycling streams without compromising on strength, barrier properties, or shelf life. For environmentally conscious consumers, this innovation provides peace of mind, as it minimizes environmental impact and contributes to a circular economy where materials are reused rather than discarded. **For more:** [**Recyclable Stand Up Pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/stand-up-bag)

Functionality is another key factor driving the popularity of recyclable stand up pouches. Their lightweight construction reduces transportation costs and carbon emissions compared to rigid packaging options like glass jars or metal cans. The “stand up” feature ensures that products are displayed upright on retail shelves, enhancing visibility and brand recognition. Moreover, these pouches can be fitted with resealable zippers, spouts, or tear notches, making them more convenient for consumers while maintaining product freshness. Industries dealing with products such as coffee, snacks, detergents, and even frozen foods benefit from the versatility and practicality of this packaging type.

From a branding perspective, recyclable stand up pouches offer exceptional customization opportunities. Their broad, smooth surface provides ample space for high-quality graphics, vibrant colors, and eco-conscious messaging. Businesses can effectively communicate their commitment to sustainability while also capturing consumer attention with eye-catching designs. As consumer preference shifts toward brands that demonstrate environmental responsibility, packaging plays a vital role in influencing purchasing decisions. Companies that adopt recyclable stand up pouches not only enhance their environmental credentials but also strengthen brand loyalty in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

The future of packaging is undoubtedly leaning toward sustainable innovation, and recyclable stand up pouches are at the forefront of this transformation. As recycling infrastructure improves globally and consumer demand for eco-friendly products continues to grow, these pouches will likely become a standard in many industries. They represent a perfect balance of sustainability, practicality, and marketing potential, making them an invaluable tool for businesses committed to reducing their carbon footprint. By embracing recyclable stand up pouches, companies are not only addressing the environmental challenges of today but also investing in a greener, more responsible future for tomorrow.",1,1758158087.0,BloggersCommunity,0,1.0,False

1njuvd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1njuvd1/blue_collar_and_at_a_loss_no_idea_whats_next/,"Blue Collar And At A Loss, No Idea What's Next?","I've been working as a Carpenter for the last 3-4 years. Well sort of. I got into this just as the world was opening up post-Covid. Before this I was in college and working at a coffee shop. I bounced off a Computer Science degree and fell into a fit of depression over my lack of career prospects.

I've really thrown myself at this line of work since then. Went all in, worked every hour I could, as hard as I could, read and watched videos about carpentry in my off time, spent 16% on everything I made last year on tools for my job. Put up with workplace abuse, unsafe labor practices, wage theft. Anything it took, because all I wanted to be was this super badass carpenter, building things people liked, making good money, working towards the life I want to have.

Except no one wanted to let me be that person. Nobody was ever willing to train me. I had to teach myself everything I know. Even then employers didn't want to put me in a position to do so. They loved when I did their back breaking dirty work for them, but actively kept me off the real skilled work. Every contractor I worked for did this. Moreover they weren't paying me well at all. Like, can't live without being in abject poverty levels of compensation. And they were always stingy and slow with the raises. They weren't paying me in experience, and surely weren't paying me in currency.

I kept jumping from contractor to contractor, worked for three different employers, jobs got a little better each time. But its the same problems at each place. Lack of pay, lack of training, workplace abuse, wage theft, labor law violations. I can't help but feel like I'm just wasting my life. I feel like such an abject failure being nearly 30 and still being unable to comfortably financially support myself. Theirs seems to be a hard cap on how much you can make as a carpenter working for someone else, doesn't matter how skilled you are, how hard you work, you're stuck at like ~60k a year. That's just not enough money to live anything close to a good life as a single person today. I need like at least double that.

I don't know if the job market was just a lot stronger when I got into this or if I was just lied too because I thought I could work really hard and in a few years time be making like $30-35 an hour, and be on the road to like $50-60/hr. Reality is nothing of the sort. I could only ever get jobs with these horrific residential contractors. I worked on homes worth millions of dollars owned and rented by the rich and (in)famous. Tom Brady's wife previously rented one of the apartments in a building I did a kitchen in. I did the siding on a house a stones throw away from one of Jeffery Epstein's properties. Its not like I'm throwing up shacks for the section 8 housing authority. Theirs money in this; I'm just not allowed to have nearly any of it for some reason. Bosses have enough money to buy their wife a Mercedes and take multiple international vacations a year. Why can't they let me work enough to let me move out of my parents house?

I got really sick of this, wanted something different I took a local government job working for a wealthy municipality using my building skills for public works maintenance. Its a nice, easy stable job, no slow season, no worrying about layoffs, no backbreaking labor, its basically impossible to get fired. Its a bit of a pay bump, 60k/yr base, more with overtime. I can actually get a bit of overtime at this place. Theirs benefits, paid federal holidays, vacation time, a union, health insurance and a pension, Overtime opportunities are sparse and infrequent currently but I think they'll get more consistent as I gain seniority. I'm also really good at the job, like better than my last three predecessors, and everyone really respects and appreciates me here.

Still, I don't really make enough to pay rent, I'll never be able to own a home, never be able to have hobbies or travel, the commute is like 3 hours round trip a day, so I really don't have any time in the afternoons, theirs really no direct opportunities for advancement unless I'm here for another 10 years, and I'm not progressing in developing my skill set so I can't really leave here for a better paying job down the line,

I've thought about leaving this job to go work for another contractor, but I see ads on Indeed for carpenters, barely paying more than I make now, and they really want someone with a solid 10+ years experience, with way more skills than I realistically have. I'm an insanely hard worker and a fast learner but theirs no faking it in this line of work. If I hadn't been snubbed and passed over by my last three employers I'd feel a bit more empowered to take a risk, but at this point it feels like I'd just be plunging myself back into poverty and abuse for no good reason.

A few years back I tried to get an apprenticeship with the Carpenters union and was rejected, I've been told all the trade unions by me are similarly impossible to get into unless someone puts a word in for you. I don't know anyone, don't have any family or friends who can pull strings for me. And I really hate living where I am and don't want to commit to another 5+ years here.

At this point I'd ready to put a mattress in the bed of my truck and drive out to literally anywhere and do literally anything for the right opportunity. But it just seems like theirs nothing out their, I don't even know where to put my time and energy. Theirs just so many barriers to entry everywhere, even when things were busy. Everyone in the blue collar space wants years of experience in specifically and exactly what they do, no one wants to train, no one wants to pay, hell forget pay, just let me work the difference. I'd work 80 hours a week if they let me. I'd never said no to a bit of overtime in my life. I'd do it even if it didn't pay time and a half. 

At one point I thought about driving across the country to knock on doors in the Texas oilfields for a job, those guys get to work a lot of hours right? Until I looked into it, and realized its very much another closed club, you have to know someone or good luck and keep trying. I've looked into trying to get into a union program in other states, they seemingly don't take interviews remotely, and I can't exactly leave home, a stable if underpaying job and everything I know for a job that doesn't pay me enough to support myself and could lay me off leaving me stranded any minute. I don't have the time and money to fly around the country trying to interview for jobs. The blue collar world isn't like the white collar world where you can do a few Zoom interviews and line something up in a new city before you get their.

I thought about starting my own business, the problem is I can't get real contracts until I get my state general contractors license, and I cant get that because I lack 2 years of documented work experience because my first couple employers didn't pay their taxes and neglected to give me a W2. And realistically theirs some major gaps in my skillset, for example I don't have any real exterior framing experience, have no idea how to cut roofs, I've never done fine cabinetry. I'm really good at what I do know, I'm more of a interior finish work, siding, decks kind of guy. But I'd have to teach myself the rest of this stuff on the fly, and that's a very risky proposition.

I thought about going back to school, but I defiantly can't do a traditional 4 year degree. I've accumulated about 60 college credits but have horrific ADHD that caused me to fail out of college twice prior. I was thinking I could maybe do an online degree in a self paced program like WGU in something like Business or Communications, but I really don't think its realistic to think that degree would lead anywhere, especially now that its evident where in a major recession.

I'm just so perplexed why theirs seemingly no opportunities for a driven, hardworking, relatively young, able bodied man willing to do hard labor for long hours.",1,1758157748.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

A man invited me to dinner on Saturday night. We’re both mid-forties, I’m female, he’s male.  It would be our second in-person meetup. (Our first “meet” was by video, our first in-person meet was a coffee date that lasted four hours.) 


Our plan is to do dinner and something else, probably the Portrait Gallery.  I have some dietary restrictions so wanted to offer some choices; and I usually can’t finish a full entree so I don’t want leftovers. Often times, people get worried that I didn’t like the food (b/c I leave so much food behind) when I do. 


For the restaurant, I’d like a “date” vibe for a date night, without blowing the bank or choosing a place that’s too casual.  I think he’ll be paying but still.  (My favorite places are the fancy Zaytina and hole in the wall Chinatown Express.)


I am predominantly vegetarian, with some poultry and seafood.  He eats everything.  Both of us are a bit of foodies. I think we’d prefer tapas-style. 


Would love to hear your take on the “date”
Vibe of the following places, keeping it affordable (under $50 each). Also welcome other places- can walk to Penn Quarter and Mt Vernon as well. 


- Founding farmers & distillers
- Urban roast (believe this may be better for Christmas holiday decorations)
- Oyamel
- Busboys and poets
- Izakaya
- Daikaya 
-other places? 


Thanks so much!

They arrive on time and are consistently ready to work, receptive to coaching, and genuinely seem like they want to do a good job. In the past we’ve had new hires that are rude, clearly don’t care or have spotty attendance but genuinely i don’t think there’s a bad apple in this bunch. 

One of our SSVs has devoloped a really bad ego in the past year and has been consistently shittalking the new baristas and i find it so rude. She acts like everything they do or any question is such a nuisance. Today i was talking to her and a new hire of 6 weeks asked us if hot Venti americanos got 3 or 4 shots(Really common mistake in my experience, it took me months for me to learn they got 4!) and as soon as she was out of earshot she rolled her eyes and said the new barista she’d really know that by now. 

A couple of the newbies are taking notice have told me they really dread working with her, which makes me so sad. 

in the past i would talk to my SM but this ssv kisses the higher ups ass and it never ends up being worth it.

 the ironic thing is that despite working at starbucks for over 5 years and being a “coffee master” I never order anything with steamed milk when this SSV is on bar cuz the milk is either overaerated and gross and under aerated and burnt. Attempts to coach her just cause her to roll her eyes. Multiple google reviews mention her by name. If she could model good behavior i would give her more of a pass for being pissy but there are some days i geniunely think she should be fully retrained.

Now, I know there's plenty of people out there who simp for Wally and there's some WallyxReader and rule 34 material based on this guy, so this thing the host is pointing out could be alluding to how some of us the audience have taken to ""loving"" this character, but do yous think there could be more to this intrusive question in universe? 

Is Wally in WH supposed to be in actuality THE manic pixie dream guy that has admirers in the muppet world? Creepy obsessed human admirers of the show? Has there been an episode or two of Wally going on dates with other muppets/people? 

As much as I would adore the idea of Wally independently taking someone out on a date to show them around the neighborhood or going to a restaurant or on a coffee date or something cute like that, I just can't help but imagine some dark implications this question truly poses, considering Wally seems confused at the concept of romance and is often told what to do and has to often be taught things.

“You’re late. Again.”

I muttered an apology, tying my apron in jerky knots. The place reeked of burnt coffee and fryer oil, and the laminated menus stuck to my fingertips. My whole shift blurred together: orders barked out, plates clattering onto counters, ketchup bottles lined up like little soldiers waiting to be refilled.

But I couldn’t focus. My hands went through the motions—wipe, refill, carry—but my brain under my pillow, hunched over pages that felt heavier than any textbook. Sentences from the diary kept replaying in my head, jagged and insistent. I poured ketchup into an already full bottle. 

“Are you even listening?” my boss snapped.

I blinked at him, startled, before mumbling another apology. He shook his head, muttering something about “people these days” before stomping off. My hands moved faster, but my mind was already gone, lost in the ink of 1986.

I had read, and read the lines in my head. I could almost recite them from memory, like an incantation. The house was loud before I even reached the living room, clattering, thuds, the crash of something breaking against the wall.

“There! There! Don’t you see it?” Grandma’s voice was shrill, ragged.

She stood in the middle of the room, her arm raised, a porcelain figurine clutched tight in her hand. Her eyes were wild, locked on the dark stretch of hallway.

“The monster! Standing right there, staring at me!” She hurled the figurine, and it shattered against the doorframe, shards scattering across the floor like teeth.

“Grandma stop!” I rushed forward, dodging as she grabbed a stack of mail and flung it into the air, paper spiraling down around us like a storm.

She didn’t hear me, or wouldn’t. Her hands shook as she snatched the TV remote from the side table and whipped it toward the hall. It bounced against the carpet with a dull thud. I caught her wrists before she could grab another object. Her skin was fragile, birdlike, but the strength in her arms startled me. She fought me, her voice breaking into guttural sobs.

“Grandma, listen! There’s nothing there. Look at me. Just look at me.”

For a moment she froze, breathing hard, her chest heaving like she’d just run a marathon. Her eyes darted back to the hallway, then finally to my face.

“You don’t understand,” she whispered, her voice shaking. A chill crept up my spine, but I forced my voice to stay calm. “It’s just the shadows. Just the house settling. You’re tired. Please Sit down.”

The clatter started in the hallway,  like something shifting weight from foot to foot, then the sound of fabric whispering against wood.“You see him, don’t you?” she said, not looking at me but past me, voice small and reverent and furious all at once. For a beat I mouthed the safer answers“It’s just the light,” “house noises,” the rehearsed lines anyone uses for the old and the afraid. But then the air shifted. The temperature dipped like someone had opened a window I hadn’t noticed. The hairs on my arms rose.

At the far end of the hall, where the wallpaper faded and the family photos leaned like witnesses, something moved that was not shadow. Two small points, eyes? Caught the television light and held it like coinage. She threw the figurine again, with the force of someone calling back an old insult.  It tilted its head, and the movement was almost polite, like a host watching a guest make a spectacle of himself.  I fumbled for the switch and flooded the hallway with yellow light. The shadows scattered, breaking into harmless shapes: the umbrella stand, the framed photos, the faint scuff on the wallpaper. Nothing more.

My breath slowed, but only because I forced it to.Grandma was still trembling in her chair, muttering under her breath, her eyes fixed on the now-empty stretch of hallway. She looked small, shrunken into herself, like a child who’d seen the boogeyman in her closet.

“It was nothing,” I said, too quickly. “Just the dark playing tricks, that’s all. You scared yourself, Grandma.”She didn’t look at me.

“It’s just… your mind,” I continued, my voice steadier than my heartbeat. I looked at Grandma. Sometimes, all the time now, I find myself staring at her, praying that she would just go. I know, I'm awful. But when she starts screaming, and yelling at the top of her lungs because of some random shadow she saw, bringing me into her delusion, making me see things that aren't really there….I cant. 

 I dread coming home because lately the episodes are more and more frequent. She will either look for food at midnight or watch documentary reruns at full volume at 4 am. Maybe, if she´s feeling creative, she will rummage through Grandpa´s drawers and pull everything out to take “inventory”. And when she's finally done arranging and rearranging she´ll smile at me. But it's not the same smile, her face is vacant, her eyes unfocused. I hate having to make all of the meals, wash all the dishes, pay all the bills and with no support. But most of all, I hate myself for having these thoughts. 

“How about we take you to bed Granny ?” - I asked, sincerely hoping she would go without a fight. She looked at me like she was trying to figure out who I was before replying “ Yes, please”. And so she went to bed, and I went to my familiar escape. 

  


***1988***

 *Good morning. Reading all this made me feel very silly. Getting away from you made me feel so good. Everything is different. I am too. I feel more stable. It's still hard for me not to take things personally. Not to feel bad for days or fall apart at the memories. But I'm getting there, getting better.*



***1988***

*Torn* 

*between wanting to be seen;*

*and hating the idea of anyone staring at me,*

*or thinking anything about me.* 

*Here I am,* 

*acknowledge me.*

*Want all my secrets back,*

*don’t want anyone to know,* 

*anything about me anymore.* 

*Erase me from your memory;*

*erase me from your mind.*

***1988***

*My lungs smell like mint…*

I froze at the first line. ""My lungs smell like mint."" The phrase felt like a piece of a puzzle I’d lost long ago, and I mouthed the words to feel their shape. A slow burn of recognition crawled up my throat, and then everything snapped into place. Tears blurred my vision. My chest tightened until it felt like I couldn't breathe.

A memory resurfaced. I’d loved that mint plant for ten years. Came home from school to find Grandma had mistakenly watered it with her coffee. It died two days later. I remember crying for what felt like forever, and her getting so angry at me. It should have been the other way around. But now I know that was when the dementia began. That had to be why she said it. ""I hated that plant, you know. It reminded me of her,"" she spatted. ""She always used to say her 'lungs smelled like mint,' whatever the fuck that meant. I hated that bitch, your mother.""

Fall is typically a busier season for me at work, and I’m also a big American football fan so that occupies some of my time, but there are moments where I want to continue my journey but just can’t. 

Has anyone else ever hit a roadblock on their journey to the Tower? Did you ever intentionally take a break? Did you read something else between? What motivated you to keep going? ",3,1758157002.0,TheDarkTower,13,0.67,False

It gets rid of the adjusted activity baseline once in a while for like no reason even though I have it set to lightly active.

Usually it adds a couple hundred more calories to my budget and slowly gets rid of it as I import calories. But this is not the case, typically my expenditure calories are around 2000.  ",2,1758156979.0,cronometer,5,1.0,False

I’m 27 m and at 185 lbs. This is a diet/workout question for anyone who knows fitness pretty well. I’m discouraged to keep trying to lose weight. Earlier this year I went hard for like 4 months. I ran and jogged on the treadmill just about everyday, sometimes for 30 minutes sometimes for an hour. I also lifted weights. Im ex military and I have a pretty strong will to keep things going but I just wasn’t seeing any results for like 3-4 months. 

I was tracking my calories on an app and just making sure I’m burning calories in a deficit.
One problem I noticed was when I went really hard I would get super hungry and I think my eating habits might have been counterproductive.

I started to think maybe it was my diet, so I switched to all sugar free and diet drinks if not just water. One question I have is if having sugary coffee would prohibit me from losing any fat. I have coffee with creamer every morning, I tried sugar free creamer it’s disgusting, id rather chew on glass to wake myself up in the morning than down that crap eww never again. I have a pretty big caffeine addiction lol. I mainly cook chicken and I drink protein shakes.

I also tried fasting and I think I started to see some results but my weight pretty much stayed the same. I’m reaching 30 and I think my body is just changing. 

Anyway I’m getting back into it again and just going slower. I read online that walking incline is better for losing fat than just sprinting it out. Today and yesterday I just walked on incline for only 15 minutes and some calisthenics (100 pushups type thing) and some dumbbells. I think what really discouraged me last time was I would go pretty hard and didn’t see any results.

To be more specific im skinny fat, im very tall and the only fat I got is at my gut. If you looked at me tho you wouldnt be able to tell I worked out unless i flexed for you or something. Very skinny legs and wrists and an expanding torso that wont go anywhere. Tell me what to dooo plzzz. 

To sum my questions up: is the sugary coffee going to prohibit my effort and keep me at the same weight?

Also how hard should I go on the treadmill: time and how fast, and how long should I give this process?
