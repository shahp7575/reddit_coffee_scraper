I was in Starbucks in Taiwan yesterday. I had my coffee in an indoor cup, want to get it out into a takeaway cup as we wanted to leave.

So I, wanting to practice and thinking back to my textbook, asked in such a mouthful of words:

你可以幫我把那杯咖啡放在外帶杯嗎？

Such an overcomplicated mouthful!

My Taiwanese partner casually walked past, overhearing this and corrected me. He said to the server:

可以外帶嗎？

And I just felt so stupid for wanting to try and use the grammar points (active voice 把 structure) from my text book when it could have just been so simple and polite.

So, that’s just my experience and I think it’s a bit of a warning about paying too much attention to grammar and text book usage can give you a bit of analysis paralysis - when just being simple will more than suffice and is even preferred.",1,1752214698.0,ChineseLanguage,0,1.0,False

Maybe we could build a theater where no employees are required. You just go to an iPad, choose movie. Go to the movie. Everything could be automated. Only employee needed is security guard and lots of security guard people would like that job because they could be allowed free pop corns and sodas. And coffee.

1lwzk3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lwzk3z/the_perfect_coffee_date/,The Perfect Coffee Date?,"So I haven’t been on a first date in years, and I’m going on one soon. I’m a little nervous because the girl is certainly a little out of my league, so I read a few articles and posts and synthesized them into a master plan for a perfect coffee date. I know I’m overthinking it, so please don’t comment that. It’s long so no pressure to read through it, but if even one ir two people (especially ladies) would read it and either confirm or critique it I would be greatly indebted to you. 

Coffee Date

Receive the date as a gift and an opportunity for a good time. Do not put pressure on yourself or the other person for it to go a certain way. Happy, positive energy; don’t  take yourself so seriously.
The coffee date is not a huge commitment, it’s for having an hour to two hours of fun interaction with a wonderful person. Don’t stress, be yourself: she already said yes to going out with you. 

Be Early, Be clean, Be Prepared. Lead the Date in the direction it needs to go. Don’t wait for her or wait until you have to make a move. Always direct it in a healthy, casual and pleasant way


Preparedness: New wallet: no shuffling with cash. Gas in the car. Gum, breath mints are your friends. Excedrin, water bottles. Get cash. Iron clothes if appropriate, SMELL GOOD! Buy fresh Handkerchief; a gentleman always has a (clean and fresh) handkerchief. No smoking. Be well rested. No caffeine after 10a the day before. Avoid excessive caffeine that morning. Get a hair cut. Be hydrated, feel fresh and be happy that you’re going on a date with such a wonderful girl! 

Clean: bring a small bag in the trunk of the car with Cologne, mouthwash, deodorant, Gum, hair product, moisturizer. 
No smoking
Wear clothes that 25% nicer than what you usually wear. Make sure,,, that your shoes are tied tightly and that your fly is up

Early: go in, check out the spot, feel comfortable, decide where you want to sit. think about what you’ll order later, order water, DONT LOOK LIKE YOU WERE WAITING. Text her 5 minutes before the agreed meeting time. Dont be standing there smoking. 

Greeting: if you’re outside, open the door. Outside can be good, but may cause awkwardness due to the transitional space. Inside is good, but awkward if the space is crowded. Stand up, and walk toward her enough that you’ll be retracing about 5 steps to go back to the counter. Greet warmly but not eagerly, try something casual and familiar such as “hey, there you are”, “hey there, hows it going?” Make good eye contact. DO NOT CHECK HER OUT ON ACCIDENT. Please please please don’t wear something low cut; I’m weak. Add on a reserved but genuine and classy compliment such as “oh, you look so nice”, “you look lovely” 
If she’s late, don’t comment on it, even as a joke. Be reassuring, but not like a high school guidance counselor. Above all, from the first moment she must know that 1. She is the only person in the room, 2. Her time is greatly appreciated and valued, 3. She is something special and worth being at your best for. 4. There is no pressure or obligation on her for anything: she’s already given you her afternoon.

Ordering coffee: allow her enough time to look at the menu, don’t talk to her while she’s trying to decided so that she’s spending her first moments with you in a state of greatly divided attention. Allow her to order first. Avoid pronouns when talking to the server about your date. Don’t refer to her as “and for her…” 
Order a coffee that you know you’ll enjoy, don’t try something new. 

If she offers to pay then charmingly say “listen, we can go Dutch on the next one if that’s what you really prefer, but you’ve already given me your afternoon; let me get this one.” Avoid using any terms that refer to anything monetary (I.e.  “let me pay”, “I’ve got cash”, “here’s my card”) prefer neutral terms(I.e I’ve got this, let me get this)
Pick up a few napkins as you walk to the table in case of emergency. Not too many, it makes you seem like a slob. 

As you wait for coffees you must confidently begin the small talk. Starting with the smallest talk. Reference something that you’ve already talked about over text, such as a crazy storm that came through. Ask how her day’s been going, or possibly tell a funny anecdote that happened recently, (within the past 24 hours.) avoid counting rehearsed. 

Show her to your table, and allow her to sit down first. Pull out her chair if you deem it necessary. Seat yourself somewhere where you can see all entrances but cannot be seen from the entrances(optional, if you have paranoia) 

Conversation must be paced slowly and casually. There is no pressure. Making her laugh is a home run, but don’t swing and miss. Sometimes you gotta just get off the home plate. Ask questions, don’t talk too much about yourself, don’t talk about traumatic events, don’t talk about your ex, don’t give yourself away for a cheap bid at being liked for your genuineness. Be an active listener, but don’t /seem/ like an active listener. Stay calm, enjoy the time together. 

Topics generally follow these categories and this order: 
Family: 
Occupation: 
Recreation:
Dreams: 

Know when to call it. Always always always quit while you’re ahead. Don’t wait until conversation is exhausted. Leave on a good note. Have a line prepared for when it’s time to go in case it doesn’t happen naturally. Don’t reference the long drive home if you have driven far, it will make her feel like a burden. Don’t reference the time on the clock, it will make her feel like a schedule item. Prefer something that highlights how generous she’s been with her time, and how much you appreciate her. This is very important, say goodbye once. Don’t awkwardly wave eight times. 

Leave her feeling that you are glad you went out with her and open to whatever wonderful possibilities there might be for the two of you. ",1,1752214619.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I found out 4 days ago and feel like a idiot. I have that weird feeling in my chest like having too much coffee. I definitely can’t sleep.

This is an update to a post I made at Christmas on in r/marriage but the bots are not into my update. I found my wife drunk in our car with her tennis coach one morning around christmas time: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hj3p6y/wife_didnt_come_home_last_night_found_her_drunk/

Things seemed to be going well. I showed her some reddit comments. We read ‘not just friends’ (she thought they were between stages 2 and 3 if you’ve read it). She deleted him and changed coaches. Our marriage and family has been good. I encouraged her to go on trips to places – ½ leisure, ½ work to decompress.

We’re on holiday now, and she asked me to update her Whatsapp (she’s rubbish at tech). I saw Tiktok open in the background with unread messages and my curiosity got the better of me. There were messages from that day, between the two of them. Banal stuff like holiday picks.

That night, I went through her phone while she snored. I checked his social media (I don’t have him on mine) and saw a picture of him at an iconic lake my wife had been on one of her trips. My heart sank. There was no date, but rocks, plants and electrical cables in his photo matched exactly one from my wife’s own photos from her trip. She had taken the picture for him.

I wrote her a letter saying I knew about him and her tennis coach. I would step aside and she could be with him. I asked for a 30 day separation to let everyone’s heads cool off. She had to leave the holiday for work travel anyway so it works. She did what you’d expect: silently staring at the paper for 3 minutes. ‘it was just some texts’. I told her I knew more and she needed to come clean. Over the next 24 hours I was treated to trickle truth par excellence, though no DARVO this time. I didn’t reveal how much I knew or how I knew it, so it all had to come out.

Definitely do trust your gut, do look through partners phone in middle of night, don't reveal how much you know or how you know it if you want to get to the truth.

As she tells it, she really did just have dinner with him and get too drunk at Xmas. She cut him out, but in May her new different tennis coach was sick and the boss paired them back up. She didn’t say no. They had a few dates and kissed. She was bored on her trip to the lake and he semi invited himself. They slept together that night.  She is awful at taking responsibility and just saying ‘I invited him along to have sex with me’. She paid for a plane ticket for him to see him on another trip for sex. She said its not about him, he’s just a kid that listens to her problems and is well put together. Its all on her.

She is desperate for reconciliation and is making some of the right noises. Therapy for her and a hall pass for me are my table stakes to begin that conversation. We have a good married and family life otherwise outside of this. We have two really happy young kids and she’s a great mother. She isn’t a fantastic or evil person she’s just sort of normal. Fallible, lovable but deeply selfish and can’t take responsibility for her actions. Can therapy fix that? For now, we are separated and everything sucks. The kids don’t know what’s going on.

I felt an incredible wave of warm satisfaction when it all came out. I’m not crazy. I was right. She had gaslit me for the better part of a year with this guy. She sort of snapped at me about ‘you’re right, you win’ when I was getting her to admit the truth. But then the realization I may have wasted 13 years of my life with this person, and my children’s lives have been destroyed because of her selfishness quickly puts that in perspective.
TLDR: Wife DID have an affair with her tennis coach and my family is destroyed. I am a broken man.

A few points from last time: I spent a few years retraining as a teacher, it wasn’t overnight. Qualifications, training placements and masters were had. Smaller kid is in a different site to older kid in terms of school. We are not based in the states. The way you think the world works may in fact, not be the way the world works.

* Won’t get scratched or stained easily  
* Can survive spills, muddy paws, and zoomies  
* Doesn’t need hacking or days of work to install  
* Works well in small spaces and doesn’t echo footsteps

1lwzdk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1lwzdk3/my_experience_at_the_2025_aa_international/,"My Experience at the 2025 AA International Convention in Vancouver, Canada","There’s a saying, “things got bad faster than I could lower my standards” and I had crossed that line. There was no more moving the goal posts. I had bottomed out. And so with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, a doctor, family and friends I set out to learn how to live sober. I went to many AA meetings. Probably averaging one meeting a day for several years. I read all the literature and learned the history of AA. I absorbed the maxims, Easy Does It,  First Things First and One Day at a Time (ODAT!). I worked the steps. I set up chairs and made coffee for meetings. Eventually I went to fewer meetings. The ones I did attend didn’t inspire me the way they once had, in fact they often left me depressed and irritated. After about ten years I stopped going to AA entirely and got on with my life. However, I remain a grateful member of AA, with fond memories of and gratitude to the people who were there for me when I needed them.
     When I read that the International Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous was going to be in Vancouver, Canada from July 3 to 6, 2025 I decided to attend. The International Convention is held every five years in a major North American city though the 2020 convention was cancelled due to the pandemic. This year’s convention marked the 90th anniversary of the founding of AA.
    Arriving in downtown Vancouver I saw many people with their AA name tags. It seemed that half of the people on the crowded streets were AA's. I was moved by the shear scale of the event. I heard that 35,000 people were there from 90 countries. Every demographic, it seemed, was represented though the majority of the delegates were white and of a certain age. 
      One speaker was an old timer with 60+ years sobriety.  It was a classic moment. ""I see I have run out of time but I have just one more story I want to tell."" These folks are known affectionately as anon speakers. They go on anon anon anon. Much of AA is story telling. What it was like, what happened and what it is like now, and many of these stories are incredibly moving and inspiring. There is so much healing power in story telling - healing for both the speaker and the listener.
   There were dozens of daytime events with a chair person and two or three scheduled speakers. Some examples of the topics were “AA in Penitentiaries”, “Dealing with Grief in Recovery” and “Tolerance and Trust”. There were sessions in Spanish and French as well as English. Translation was available through an app and headphones. There were booths with information about AA in prisons, the military and merchant marines and AA for people who are house bound. There was a display for Secular AA for those have a problem with the god part. There were smaller meetings 24 hours a day. There was also a full schedule for Al-anon, a program for family members of Alcoholics. Outside the Vancouver Convention Centre thousands enjoyed the fine weather, chatted and listened to street musicians.
   The highlight for me was the ‘Count Down’ at B.C. Place stadium where everyone stood up and the MC called out “Everyone with one year of sobriety sit down. Everyone with two years of sobriety sit  down” and so on. By the time they got to “Everybody with 35 years…”  the crowd was cheering and I and many others were still standing! As I sat down people around me patted me on the back and shook my hand. It was a moving acknowledgment of what AA could do.
     And now I am home again. Will I start going to AA meetings again? I don’t think so. Perhaps I will look into some on-line AA resources. Perhaps, but no matter what I choose I will remember the rooms and the people of AA as I trudge the road to happy destiny.

Often times when I approach I get rejected, or receive a number with no text back. When it’s a conversational place I can keep a good conversation.

Extra detail, my friends would say I’m an incredibly confident person, I’m very successful for my age, and I’m usually well dressed (no fashion model but far from slobbish) I’m in good shape 200lb with big arms and just shy of a six pack and I’m 5’10” I do have a high hairline but have a curly hairstyle I push forward to cover it

Could use any advice, even considering a dating coach at this point as I would like to be able to get back in the dating game.",1,1752213898.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1lwzb5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwzb5g/i_barely_survived/,I barely survived,"The alarm woke me shortly after the sun set and I pushed away the sleeping bag that covered my body, cautiously sitting up, reaching for the light to my left side. I wrapped my fingers around it and found the switch with my thumb. The camper lit up and I squinted, reaching for the hard case that contained my glasses, wiping them clean with the cloth I kept inside the case as well. I opened the canopy over the bed of my battered old 1984 truck. I stretched toward the sky and then stretched my legs as well, before walking into the building that housed the toilets.

After relieving myself, I washed my hands and stepped back outside. I walked back to the truck and retrieved my pack of cigarettes and thc vaporizer, taking a few hits off of the electronic device before tucking that into the key pocket of my jeans. I lit one of the little tobacco sticks and then opened the driver's side door of the truck and slipped behind the wheel, placing the key in the ignition, waiting for my phone to connect with the newer radio before backing out of the spot and leaving the Rest Area, turning right onto the highway.

I continued on the lonely road into the mountains, both stubbing out the cigarette as I entered a series of tight curves that forced me to put both of my hands on the wheel. It took me another hour to reach a small town. I pulled onto the exit ramp, my stomach rumbling in protest to the fact I hadn't eaten anything since early afternoon the day before. I found a small restaurant with an equally tiny lot, though there were a few spots still open. I pulled into one of them and cut off the engine and stepped out of the old truck.

I entered the building and was quickly shown to a table, the young server leaving a menu with me before moving away only to return with a cup for coffee and a little wire basket with creamer and sweetener packets in it along with a small glass shaker filled with real sugar. He returned again, a coffee pot in one hand, filling the ceramic cup while I browsed the breakfast dishes. It didn't take very long for me to decide on one of their breakfast sandwiches. The food didn't last much longer than the decision process had.

I paid the bill and included a decent tip, making my way back out into the lot, taking a few moments to walk a few laps around the blacktop, stretching my back again as well, and once I had limbered up a little I got back into the truck and continued out onto the road again, heading Westward through the mountains toward the valley where I had been born. I had been traveling for months and was daydreaming of spending time in a comfortable bed instead of the thin foam rubber pad I was using as a mattress as I pressed the brake, approaching another series of curves.

My engine roared as I pressed the accelerator, urging the rusty old truck up an incline, lighting another cigarette, rolling down the window to let the smoke escape into the air outside. I drove until the sun began to set and as my eyes began to close of their own accord I cranked up the radio, keeping myself awake until I saw a billboard advertising a motel twenty miles away. I pushed the pedal toward the floorboard again and lit a cigarette. I had to slam on the brakes when a deer ran in front of me, my heart hammering in my chest as I swerved over the center line and back into my lane.

There was no impact, but the adrenaline dump was making my hands shake as I pulled to the side of the road. I didn't kill the engine but sat there until the trembling in my fingers eventually stopped. I started to pull back onto the road but waited as a log truck rolled by. I waited, allowing it to get a decent head start on me before I entered the curves behind it. The moon was barely visible through the clouds and the thick canopy only made it harder to see. I turned on the brights just in time to swerve again to avoid the jackknifed truck sitting sideways in the road.

The hazard lights were flashing and the little orange triangles were already out as well, the lights on the trailer and coming from the cab casting everything in a strange yellow hue as I pulled over once again, pressing the button that activated my own hazard lights, then shifted the old truck into park. I reached under the seat to grab the large, metal flashlight from underneath where it was strapped next to my first aid kit. I tested the heavy torch, flicking the switch forward, and the bulb came to bright life as I had expected.

I stepped out, glancing around, and straining to hear just in case the driver was hurt. Nothing but the sounds of insects and other forest animals filled my ears, the buzzing of wings and the chirruping song of crickets interlaced with the croaking of tree frogs and hooting of owls.

“Hello..?” I called out, sweeping my light over the asphalt, the glimmer of broken glass reflecting back to me.

The only response I got was the normal noises along with the quiet ticking of the truck behind me as the engine started to cool. I felt a moment of fear, but became convinced that the other driver was hurt, and couldn't answer, so I did the only thing I could think of. I approached the truck, halting when I saw the state of the driver's side door. The thing looked mangled as I moved my light over it, bent and dented, small punctures in the paint and metal. They looked almost like bullet holes but that made no sense. There hadn't been enough time, and besides, no small caliber firearm had left some of those dents.

I could smell something in the air. Familiar, but I couldn't place it until I saw the blood smeared and pooled in the seat, I realized what that was. Iron. I retched and stepped back, and for a moment the thought of getting the hell out of there crossed my mind, and in retrospect, I should have. Instead I moved around to the front of the tractor trailer where I saw more gore and clear impact damage. The grille of the semi truck was nearly concave. I swept the beam of my light back and forth across the wrecked vehicle.

The sound of a branch snapping behind me had me spinning around, heart leaping into my chest initially, breath freezing in my lungs. I felt a little silly when a buck poked its head out from behind the small shrub that still hid its body from my view. I began to relax, and the animal stepped out further, and I trained the flashlight on the chest of the creature. It looked to be smeared with mud or something. As the thing stepped forward again I realized exactly what it was. Blood. Fear returned in a big way as the thing approached more, clearly not spooked by me at all.

I started to backtrack, and the thing continued to approach me. I didn't want to turn my back but if I didn't, it was going to catch up to me for sure, or I was going to trip. I turned and began to run toward my truck, and thankfully made it before the buck behind me caught up, but not fast enough to get to me before I slammed the door. I was quickly shown how wrong I was even as the thought that I was safe began to form in my mind. The thing rammed the door hard, and it dented but didn't buckle. I started to turn the keys.

The thing that looked like a buck rammed those antlers into the tire which exploded with a loud pop. I wouldn't be going anywhere. The thing stared at me through the window of the truck after puncturing my tire, and I got the feeling it was taunting me. When it started ramming the door again, I regained the ability to move, and started scooting across the seat toward the passenger side of the truck. I mentally counted down from three to zero as I scooted toward my exit, clutching the flashlight in one hand and the handle to the door in the other.

I pushed. Hard, and hit the ground running. The thing let out a noise that sounded like a bellow mixed with a grunt, but not entirely animal. There was something wrong about the vocalization. I began to run, blindly at first, into the trees, briars and other thorny shrubs tearing at my clothes and bare arms. I didn't stop, hearing the heavy hoof beats of my pursuer. Every time I turned, it would move to one side or the other, as if it were herding me somewhere. As I ran, I tripped over something and sprawled to the ground.

I lost my grip on the flashlight and it swept around in a half-arc to shine behind me. I glanced toward what had entangled my ankle and caused me to fall. I wish I hadn't. I saw a disembodied arm, and roughly a quarter of a torso. Ragged clothing clung to the ragged flesh, dried blood darkening the edges of the fabric where it had been shredded at the same time. I let out a cry before I could restrain myself. It wasn't as if I had escaped. I could hear that thing getting closer even as I struggled to my feet.

Any head start I had gotten had been negated by the fall, and by the time I was running again, that buck, or whatever was chasing me was closing in with every step. I was wearing down,but that thing didn't seem to be getting tired at all. That thought was followed by the feeling of antlers jabbing painfully into my lower back, pushing me forward. I stumbled and tried to maintain my balance, and while I stumbled, the animal headbutted me again. This time when I sprawled out, the flashlight flew from my hand.

I rolled onto my back instinctively as the creature moved to stand over me, and in that moment, I did the only thing I could think of. I made a fist and swung upward, my knuckles finding nothing but open air as it ducked backward. Even though my attack failed, it gave me the opportunity to scramble backward again, away from the beast. Its jaws parted and it let out another bellow, this one sending a chill straight to my bones. I managed to get to my feet as it took a step back and scraped at the ground with one of its front hooves, and that sound seemed off somehow as well. Like bone on bone.

I backed away slowly, not turning my back on the ting as it advanced toward me. I wasn't going to escape this way, having to carefully measure each backward step, but at least I would be able to see if the thing prepared to attack me again. I still wasn't fast enough to dodge when it did charge, closing the distance and lowering its skull almost impossibly fast. I felt the sharp pain under my ribs before I registered what was happening, body losing purchase with the earth, arcing upward before landing in a thorny bush.

I didn't have time to feel the pain, forcing myself to move even though simply breathing was painful. A beam of light caught my eye from the periphery of my vision. My flashlight! I scrambled toward it just as the thing that looked like a deer charged me again, this time its jaw opened and clamped down around the lower part of my leg. I let out another scream as the pressure increased and I literally heard my shin bone crack in the thing's mouth. I screamed out again and barely managed not to pass out from the pain.

I kicked at the deer's skull, heel connecting solidly with the top of his head over and over again until it released my leg. I scrambled away, and started moving again, trying to push myself backward. My ribs were definitely cracked as well and I barely got myself free from the tangle of branches that ripped at my skin before the thing closed in on me once more. I kicked desperately with my good leg while using my arms to continue scooting backward.

“Leave me alone!” I yelled, knowing that it was pointless, and even speaking made pain flare through my torso.

“Hello!?” came an incredulous voice in the distance.

“Help!” I cried, just a moment before the deer-thing bit down on my already injured leg again.

This time its blunt teeth closed around my knee joint, but before it could do too much damage, I heard the sound of a gunshot. The bullet whizzed past the thing, but that was enough to cause it to halt its attack on me. A beam of light focused on the blood-soaked animal and there was another shot. It jerked to the side as the wet sound of the impact reached my ears, sending a spray of blood into the air that filled the area with a foul odor. The thing looked down at me, and then toward the direction the attack had come from seemingly barely effected by being shot.

My bleary eyes turned in that direction as well as the person with the rifle advanced. The creature gave a sickening bellow and then bounded off into the forest. The man with the light and firearm approached me, and I almost broke down in tears out of sheer relief. The man knelt next to me and tried to help me stand, but after a few moments, realized that wasn't going to work. He lifted me and carried me about fifty yards back toward the road, then set me down.

“I'll be right back. I don't think it followed us.” the older man said, then jogged down the slight slope and out of sight, his flashlight beam bobbing into nothingness.

I barely clung to consciousness long enough to hear the siren of an ambulance wailing in the near distance. I blacked out only to wake up a few minutes later when the stretcher was loaded into the back of the truck, the transfer too painful to ignore even being in shock as I was. The paramedics questioned me, but I don't remember what I told them to be honest. I knew they wouldn't believe the truth.

I don't know what that thing was, but I don't drive alone any more.",1,1752213704.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The urinary frequency/urgency is the worst. When I brought up the urinary frequency to my gyno she seemed to brush it off when she mentioned that I need to lay off drinking so much water especially too late in the evening. She also mentioned caffeine - but I quit coffee months ago. The urologist is the one that mentioned vaginal atrophy and then It wasn’t until I came upon this subreddit that I realized these could all be perimenopause symptoms 

My primary care provider said I was “too young” to think about menopause 😑

We're in different country, and I am not sure if I still want to talk to her?","She was born, raised, and resides in South Korea. I am an US Citizen who migrated from South Korea more than 20 years ago. We're introduced by a mutual acquaintance of our respective fathers.

We were connected in late April. After exchanging photos and showing mutual interests, we agreed to start communicating. 

At first it was going great, and I could tell that she was an amazing person, from her hobbies, interests, her job, and her character in general. We even did a video chat after finding a right time for us, and I felt even stronger connection.

Then according to her, her work had some sort of staff restructuring, and she essentially became the manager for her team (without increase in pay or benefit, but that's besides the point). The response time became late, and now it usually takes her at least 4-5 days to respond. 

I actually got to meet her dad as he was in a middle of vacation, and my area happened to be his last stop before returning to Korea; This meeting wasn't planned, but my dad (who sometimes rushes into things) organized a nice dinner at a local restaurant when he heard about it. During the dinner, he confirmed that she was in fact, drowning in work. So I guess she was being honest with that.

This is on top of the time zone difference; She is sleeping while I am working all day, and we only have a small window of time by few hours before she gets to her work or during her break, which is around 11 pm for me.

IDK, unsurprisingly the initial excitement has gone down from both sides. It may have been unintentional on her end, and she definitely should prioritize her work, but I am not sure if I want to stay communicative with her. Because I knew this would happen, I was going to take a short vacation to Korea in Fall, so I can see her in person. But since she said herself that work is gonna keep her occupied until the end of this year, I am not sure if it's going to be worth the time and effort; Like, would she even have time for a simple coffee date?

I don't think it was anything I've said, as I have been super careful with my words, and immediately corrected myself/apologized if anything read weird after I hit sent. Her being busy could be part of the reason, but I am also willing to bet that she just doesn't see anything happening between us.",1,1752212746.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1lwz12o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwz12o,Success!,"This is my first time doing my own dip nails. I’ve been getting dip in a salon since January of this year, and I’ve been watching them closely. I wanted to do it myself because it didn’t look too hard, and I wanted to take my time making them perfect while being very gentle, unlike the salon techs. I think I did pretty well (I love them), although some of my layers are perhaps too thick. We’ll see how it holds up. I used Revel nail dips (colors Clear and Erica) and Modelones Top Coat (UV cured). Some things I noticed:

1. My right hand took 10 mins longer for my previous dip manicure to soak off than my left hand. What would cause that? I drilled off the top coat on both hands prior.
2. Regretting I soaked my nails in acetone on my coffee table without any towels and got acetone everywhere and ruined the finish on the table.
3. Wasn’t nearly as messy as I thought it would be (my dust collector did not arrive in the mail on time, and y’all scared the hell out of me about dip flu). In lieu of the dust collector, I dusted my nails off over a bowl. I made sure my living room was well-ventilated by opening windows and doors, and I wore a respirator from Harbor & Freight ($18), although it didn’t really feel necessary. 
4. Alternated between dipping in the powder vessel and pouring over (wasn’t sure which method I would like most at first). Pouring over seemed to create thinner layers. But I like dipping outright because it feels faster/easier.
5. I used a hand-file for everything after removal. But I nicked my cuticles a few times - ouch! Would a nail drill help save my cuticles, or maybe just more practice with a hand-file would help?
6. Took me 3.5 hours to do this whole thing including removing my last dip manicure. I used the Revel Nail Swift Soak bowl, and it helped remove within 20 minutes. I used a Purtato nail drill to take off the top coat from my previous dip manicure before removal.
7. I watched 3 videos on YouTube beforehand, just the top 3 in my “How To Do Dip Nails at Home” search, nothing special. I think these did help.
8. Tried to do the Apex method, but forgot a few times. It looks like I have an Apex though, right? Although there is a groove in some of my nails, which I think is from applying the base coat unevenly from too short strokes.

Anyway, thanks to this group for a large portion of my success. I couldn’t have done it without y’all!",4,1752212684.0,DipPowderNails,0,1.0,False

I'm trying to find a game for the life of me I cant remember. 

The game starts with you waking up with an alarm blaring. you go and press it and the human AI voice tells you something, maybe ""oh you're awake"" or something and you have to select a prompt on a terminal in the game. The ship so far has a way to walk left or right from your terminal in front of you, or you can access the terminal and load a simulation in a room just in front of you but down some steps. The room would on first load provide you a visual room that once you enter it is in a forest with I think a cliff that you walk on the edge and end up towards the end of this path that's a dead end that has a butterfly. you press on it and something happens.

Theres another room you can load after this thats either an apartment that now has this butterfly hanging on the wall, a tv on the left, a couch and small coffee table to your right. Along a hallway is tall floor to ceiling windows leading to a bedroom that can either have: nothing except a bed, a chair maybe and some voice mailbox or something electronic to the right of the room. It can also have a woman glitching when you approach but the apartment is dark, or a woman in a chair but as you approach her you end up being blinded by white light.

another room would be an office of some kind that you can fast forward time with some voice recorder. in a smaller attached room was a metal cart with schematics and on the wall was more schematics of the ship you would start the game in and come back to. 

I think the premise was about remembering what happened, at some point your terminal will get a weird bugged memory you can load but its just apart of the game and helps you ""complete it"". Some endings would just show some kind of celestial body in the background and I think... some doorway in space (actual door with a frame or just a door) and sometimes it can be different colors (the background colors or the celestial body).

  
I know this game was posted on youtube between 2014 to maybe 2024 at latest but I cannot for the life of me find it because I wanted to replay it.

*Norwegian Eliteserien | July 12, 2025 | Fredrikstad’s Home Court of Suffering*

---

### Key Statistics & Context

1. **Offensive Woes**:
   * Fredrikstad has scored a paltry **2 goals in 5 games** this season, slower than a sloth on a coffee break.
   * Molde, meanwhile, has managed just **1 win in their last 4 home matches**, a home record so shaky it makes a Jell-O mold feel stable.
2. **Injuries & Suspensions**:
   * Molde’s **Caleb Zady Sery** (suspended) and **Kristian Eriksen** (injured) are out, crippling their attacking options.
   * Fredrikstad’s defense, however, is intact, which is both a blessing and a curse—they’re not great at stopping goals, but they’re not great at *scoring* them either.
3. **Head-to-Head**:
   * Fredrikstad holds a **strong historical edge** over Molde at home, but history is a fickle friend when your offense is as dry as a desert.

---

### Odds Breakdown & Implied Probabilities

Using **decimal odds** from multiple bookmakers (averaged for simplicity):

|Outcome|Avg. Odds|Implied Probability|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Fredrikstad**|2.45|**40.8%**|
|**Molde**|2.70|**37.0%**|
|**Draw**|3.30|**30.3%**|

**EV Framework Adjustments** (soccer underdog win rate = 41%):

* **Fredrikstad (favorite)**:
   * Adjusted probability = (40.8% + 59%)/2 = **49.9%**
   * **EV = (49.9% - 40.8%) \* (1/2.45) ≈ +3.7%**
* \*\*Molde (underdog

1lwyudt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MidnightTiger715/comments/1lwyudt/im_losing_faith_in_my_job/,I'm Losing Faith in my Job,"For some relevant information, I got this job in 2021. I received this job on my parents' wedding anniversary four years ago. They told me that I needed a job, and I didn't want to disappoint them. I went in for two job interviews, one with the old manager, Enrique, and one with the most previous manager, Dona. My older brother, Keel, helped me get this job.

Keel was the main person training me for this job. Dona also helped me, and she was one of the kindest people that I've ever met. Keel was also helping Dona with her job. I had to learn how to brew coffee, run cash register, clean the coffee air pots, stock shelves, check product in, stock the cooler, etc. I have learned so many tasks over the four years that it seems insane, but it's just another day at work for me.

Over two years ago, Keel left the company. The reason? He was working 60-70 hour weeks, and he was not even full time. He was damn good at his job. I visited the old store plenty of times, and he was able to do his job perfectly. The other cashier I trusted, Sebastian, didn't take crap from anyone. He still cared for his coworkers. Keel and Sebastian had a good relationship with each other. I had a good relationship with the only deli worker, Pamela. I even worked her shift for two weeks: one week, she's on vacation, the second week, her house burned down. I also had to work her shift anytime she called out.

The new store was built, but Keel didn't stick around. I don't blame him. He was working more than Pamela and another full-time worker, Jeff, were working. Keel was never offered full time, despite his good work ethic. He now works for a federal agency, and is much happier. I'm stuck at this job, however. And the new manager, Ray, isn't making the situation much better.

Ray has fired numerous employees for reasons that I can't begin to understand. I have seen so many employees come and go over the two plus years that I've worked here. The employees that are leaving primarily are deli employees, thanks to Pamela and her bitchy attitude. I feel bad for her daughter, Cassandra, for having to deal with her for two, three, or four days a week. I have refused to work in the deli time and time again, primarily because of Pamela's treatment over her employees. She's the deli manager, while Ray is the manager for the entire store.

However, this doesn't stop Pamela from bossing everyone around, even if they're not deli employees. She's told me to do stuff plenty of times when everyone is doing other tasks. She also can be quite rude. The only reason I talk to her at this point is because I don't want to get on her bad side. That is the side that constantly bitches and moans about the most insignificant things. She even tries to control what the cashiers do, which is not her job. One of my other coworkers, Daphne, has complained that Pamela has yelled at her for giving the wrong order to the wrong customer, when Daphne is just a f\*\*\*ing cashier. She doesn't want to help Pamela with delivering deli orders to the correct customers.

Recently, Pamela has complained that cashiers that are trying to be helpful by taking orders for the deli workers don't tell the other workers that an order has been taken. But here's the thing; it was a one time mistake! And Pamela has the audacity to bitch to another deli worker that the cashiers won't tell them when an order's been taken. Let's be real here; taking orders is the deli's job, not the cashiers' job. I know that one of the other deli workers, Katara, does a darn good job. And she gets blamed for the other deli workers' mistakes. Supposedly, Pamela's suffering from menopause. It's different for every woman, but does it mean you have a right to act like a self-righteous bitch?

Also, one of my other coworkers, Macy, was considering quitting recently. She is from Ohio, and just became a grandma. She is constantly teased by Ray, Jeff, and Pamela for her accent and her work ethic. I know that she's a damn good worker. I just barely convinced her by letting her know that I'm on her side and that she can talk to me about anything at any time.

For me? I'm stuck making coffee, running register, taking orders for the deli, stocking shelves, completing the order for the bakery the company orders from, printing cash up sheets, etc. It feels like I have to drag myself out of bed four days a week for this company. For what? Less than $500 a paycheck? I don't drive; there aren't many businesses that are within walking distance from my house. What am I supposed to do? I feel trapped in this hell. Every work day feels like it's draining the life force out of me. Even my parents agree it to be so. I'm seriously at a loss. I feel like I don't want to spend the rest of my life here. It's simply not worth it.",1,1752212002.0,u_MidnightTiger715,0,1.0,False
1lwytgm,https://i.redd.it/w2l6ta1bl6cf1.png,I automated my Leads research and discovered something crazy - My AI assistant does 30-45 Minutes of research in 90 seconds!,"Hey Reddit! Something wild happened last week. I was drowning in research work before calls (you know, the usual LinkedIn stalking and Google diving). So I discovered this crazy automation that changed everything.



Here's the magic: When someone books a call through [Cal.com](http://Cal.com), my AI assistant instantly:

\- Find their full LinkedIn profile (the right one, not random people with the same names!)

\- Digs up their company info

\- Grabs latest news about their business

\- Dumps everything into a neat Google Sheet



The best part? It's CRAZY accurate. Like ""how did you know all this about me?"" accurate.



Real example from yesterday:

Someone booked a call → 90 seconds later I had:

\- Their complete work history

\- What their company actually does (not just the corporate jargon)

\- Latest news about their business

\- Their LinkedIn profile

\- Everything organized in my sheet



Tools I used:

\- n8n for the workflow

\- [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) for bookings

\- Jina AI for website scraping

\- Perplexity for news research

\- Apify for LinkedIn data

\- Some AI magic to make sense of it all



Before: Me spending 30-45 minutes researching before each call. 

After: AI does everything in 90 seconds while I grab coffee.



The crazy thing? People think I'm super prepared for calls now. Little do they know my AI assistant did all the heavy lifting while I was probably watching cat videos.



If you're in sales, marketing, or just hate manual research - this could be a game changer for you too!

1lwyrm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwyrm5/i_used_to_prefer_the_night_shift_as_a_bus_driver/,I used to prefer the night shift as a bus driver,"The lights of the bus hum faintly, casting an eerie glow over the empty seats. It’s just past midnight, and I’m nearing the end of my shift. My eyes ache from hours of staring through the windshield, navigating the same route I’ve driven for years. I’m ready to call it a night, park this beast, sink into a barstool, and let a cold beer drown the night.

I spot a lone figure standing at the next stop, hunched under the dim streetlights. I ease the bus to a halt, the doors hissing open. He steps aboard. He’s a tall, lanky man dragging a large suitcase behind him. The thing is bulky, scuffed, and heavy-looking, like it’s packed with bricks. He’s wearing a ragged surgical mask, probably had it since covid. It was pulled tight over his face. It obscures everything but his eyes, which dart nervously, avoiding mine. I offer my usual “***Evening,***” but he mumbles something incoherent, a low, garbled sound that sounded like it came from a bad dream. He shoves a crumpled bill into the fare box and lurches toward the back, the suitcase scraping along the floor.

I glance at him in the overhead mirror as I pull away. He’s sitting alone, slouched, one hand resting on the suitcase like it’s a pet. Something about him sets my nerves on edge, but I shake it off. Just another late-night passenger. This city’s a zoo at this hour, and I’ve seen every kind of animal.

A few stops later, he stands abruptly, shuffling his feet to the rear door. He doesn’t look back, doesn’t say a word, just stumbles off into the dark. The doors close, and I’m alone again, the bus rumbling toward the end of the route. My shoulders loosen a bit. Almost done.

I pull into the depot, the lot quiet except for the steady hum of the other buses idling in the fuel line. I grab my clipboard and start my post trip inspection. Gotta make sure no one’s passed out in the back or left their phone under a seat. I move down the aisle, scanning the rows. Nothing out of place. No forgotten umbrellas, no sleeping drunks.

Then I see it. The suitcase. Tucked under the seat where the masked guy was sitting. My stomach twists. People forget things all the time. I’m always turning in lost wallets, bags, hats, but this thing? It’s too big, too bulky to be simply forgotten. I step closer, crouching to get a better look. The suitcase is old, canvas fraying at the edges, with a zipper that looks rusted. And then I notice it: a dark, wet stain spreading across the floor beneath it. My breath catches. I notice the air smells faintly metallic, like copper.

I kneel down next to it, my heart thumping louder than it should. The stain glistens in the dim light, and I lean closer, squinting. It’s not coffee or soda. It’s thick, red. Blood. A cold sweat prickles my skin. My hand hovers over the suitcase, trembling. “***I should just call it in, let someone else deal with this***” I think to myself. But my fingers brush the zipper, and some stupid part of me needs to know.

The zipper sticks at first, like it’s fighting to keep its secrets. The zipper finally gives way, and the suitcase flops open. Inside, packed tight, are pieces. Human pieces. Arms, legs, a torso, chopped up like meat in a butcher’s shop. The flesh is pale, slick with blood, and a hand sits on top, fingers curled like they were searching for a way out. My stomach lurches, and I stumble back, my boots slipping in the pooling blood.

I can’t look away. The horror’s too real. That masked man’s garbled voice echoes in my skull, low and twisted. Who was this poor soul? And who was *he*? This city has her secrets, and I feel like I just unzipped one that didn't want to be told.",7,1752211723.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1lwyr2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/braincancer/comments/1lwyr2a/on_june_5_2025_my_lovely_father_left_us_to_be/,"On June 5, 2025 my lovely father left us to be with God.","On June 5th at 10:44am, my Dad, Hank, left us to live with the lord in heaven. I am not very religious, however my dad was a devout catholic and so I’d like to believe that’s where he is. 

I wanted to first thank this reddit community for helping me and my family during these dark times. The experience, knowledge, and wisdom shared with us helped immensely and I will always be appreciative. 

Also, I wanted to share a bit about my Dad’s journey with brain cancer and his story. 

My dad was diagnosed in 2013 with an IDH1+ anaplastic astrocytoma in his right frontal lobe the size of an orange. He had a total resection immediately following its discovery, except for my sister’s first volley ball game which he absolutely refused to miss-( just further shows the kind of person my dad was). From hospital to volley ball game and immediately into the OR. After treatment (standard of care chemo and radiation) my dad was cancer free until 2024. 

For him, cancer free meant he worked a rigorous position at an oil company, traveled the world, went to morning coffee with me (his eldest daughter), got his MBA degree, went all over the USA to “Big game” football weekends with his friends, began speaking and consulting in his field, and overall he lived without much restriction. He even tried to learn Portuguese! This truly was a blessing. 

In 2024-we began to notice new symptoms: Shuffling gait, falling, incontinence, and less subtle behavioral changes. Somehow we didn’t even think to guess cancer. He had just had a clean scan 3 months prior? Me going into medicine, I thought it sounded like another pathology- Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus. When he told his doctor and went for an impromptu MRI, the results were heartbreaking. 

As many of you know- these tumors -*generally*- tend to recoccur around the original resection site. However my Dads had gone from the right prefrontal, to the prior lobe, to the periventricular and paramedian regions, and most devastatingly to the thalamus. In less than 6 months we had at least 6 new enhancing regions. 

 
Re-Treatment was very rough, due to an unfortunate and rare Avastin side effect, on my dad and he ended up bedbound. He remained this way, fluctuating up and down for about eight months before he passed. 

Although I can’t even begin to explain how my heart feels like it is split in two~ I am grateful he is no longer suffering.

Despite having brain cancer my Dad was so much more than this. He was a fighter, an intense family man, an amazing friends, a glowing boss, a coffee connoisseur, an ice cream aficionado, a lover of travel, and the funniest and most personable guy. 

We were given 11-12 years of cancer free time. When initially we were told 11-18 months. 
I am so incredibly thankful to have spend those years with my dad- the best and most supportive, loving dad. 

Thank you for reading and best wishes to those struggling with the disease and their loved ones. 

With love and regard

Alright, my amazing MaximizeMe friends! Let’s dive into something super important today—*focus rituals*! You know, those little routines that can make a world of difference in how we tackle our work and stay productive. 

Ever find yourself staring at a blank screen, feeling like your brain just hit the snooze button? 😴 *Me too.* Some days, I could swear my thoughts are out on a coffee break while I’m just sitting there, wishing for inspiration to strike like lightning. 

But here’s the magical part! I stumbled upon a focus ritual that’s been my *secret sauce* for success, and I’m excited to share it. Spoiler: It only takes a few minutes! 

**Here’s my go-to pre-work routine:**

1. **The 5-Minute Mindfulness**: Before I dive in, I take 5 minutes to just breathe. Deep breaths, slow down the heart rate, and let the mind settle. I like to think of it as hitting the “reset” button. Anyone else feel like breathing techniques can sometimes make you feel like a zen master? 🧘‍♂️

2. **Declutter the Space**: A chaotic desk = a chaotic mind. I spend a minute clearing any unnecessary stuff. Just me? It’s like decluttering my brain too! Plus, who doesn’t feel accomplished after tossing out that half-eaten granola bar? 🙈

3. **Set the Mood**: I crank up a killer playlist that gets me in the zone. Nothing like some bangers to pump up the energy! 🎶 What’s your go-to work jam? Fun fact: I get more stuff done when “Eye of the Tiger” is pumping in the background! 

4. **Write Down the Game Plan**: I grab a sticky note or a fancy planner and jot down three things I want to accomplish. It keeps me on track and gives me a little rush of motivation just thinking about crossing them off. Anyone else love the satisfaction of a good checklist? It’s like a mini victory each time! ✔️

5. **Visualize Success**:  Just before I start, I take a moment to visualize what success looks like. I imagine myself hitting those goals, feeling that rush of accomplishment. It’s like providing a sneak peek of victory! Isn’t it wild how our minds can shape our reality? 

I know we all have unique routines or rituals that fuel our focus. Maybe you have your own dance party to get pumped, or you light a candle to signify work time. Whatever it is, let’s celebrate those little moments that set us on the path to peak performance! 

Let’s keep this conversation rolling—what’s your *one* ritual that helps you lock in that focus? Share below! 🍀✨",1,1752211628.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1lwypkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lwypkt/i_think_my_boyfriend_is_leaving_me/,I think my boyfriend is leaving me..,"I (17F) have been with my Christian boyfriend (19M) for almost 9 months now


>The beginning already was really sudden. We met online and met in person a few days after talking [we live 30 mins from eachother] i had only had online relationships so I was super excited and told my parents. When we met we went to get coffee together (I was so excited because of how much of a gentleman he was) getting my door, super sweet and charming. He told me he was a Christian man and that was super important to his life (I didnt grow up religiously) we were inseparable, everything moved really fast. I fell really hard. During the beginning (October-late January) i was being cyber bullied by his ex girlfriend and her friends. It took a deep toll on my self esteem, i was able to confront her and make peace myself. For his birthday I drew his car (early November) I tried pushing to be involved in church so he knew I was serious with my efforts of being with him. and valentines day I made him a love letter as tall as him, made alot of handmade from the heart things.. I noticed his efforts started depleting. I was getting insecure, we fought more and more. Less effort, less spending time together. He always told me that he needs to spend more time at home and that he needs to work more. If his friend (19M) wants to hangout he immediately goes. If I ask its ""I cant waste money"" . 

>In April I found out from his ex girlfriend that he lied about being a virgin to me, which the first day we met he told me ""I won't be with you unless youre a virgin"" which i was. He made me feel guilty when I didnt have the same povs as him with religion. When I found out it really hurt. She told me all the things they did, how he treated her.. very overly detailed descriptions. I tried holding myself together. I confronted him the next day (which was at church) he fell apart infront of me. When we were able to truly talk about it at my house he wanted me to ask questions. Poking me, I snapped. I cried and yelled. He told me things about myself that have made me feel so insecure and have self hatred. Everytime I told him I was insecure he would go to....... things he thought I wanted. 

>he informed me that he suspected i had bipolar disorder from how i go from high anger, to full mental breakdowns and then happy. That alone is dont know what to do with that information as I won't self diagnose. Lately things have gotten to a point we have had the conversation of ""what happens if we break up"" and how it would go... he asked for some of his belongings today and I just feel like its the end. I want to be with him, truly. I have given him my all. Ive definitely not been perfect. But I dont want it to end. ",2,1752211518.0,Advice,5,1.0,False
1lwypil,https://i.redd.it/cm1rnhyxj6cf1.png,I automated my Leads research and discovered something crazy - My AI assistant does 30-45 Minutes of research in 90 seconds!,"Hey Reddit! Something wild happened last week. I was drowning in research work before calls (you know, the usual LinkedIn stalking and Google diving). So I discovered this crazy automation that changed everything.



Here's the magic: When someone books a call through Cal, my AI assistant instantly:

\- Find their full LinkedIn profile (the right one, not random people with the same names!)

\- Digs up their company info

\- Grabs latest news about their business

\- Dumps everything into a neat Google Sheet



The best part? It's CRAZY accurate. Like ""how did you know all this about me?"" accurate.



Real example from yesterday:

Someone booked a call → 90 seconds later I had:

\- Their complete work history

\- What their company actually does (not just the corporate jargon)

\- Latest news about their business

\- Their LinkedIn profile

\- Everything organized in my sheet



Tools I used:

\- n8n for the workflow

\- Cal for bookings

\- Jina AI for website scraping

\- Perplexity for news research

\- Apify for LinkedIn data

\- Some AI magic to make sense of it all



Before: Me spending 30-45 minutes researching before each call. 

After: AI does everything in 90 seconds while I grab coffee.



The crazy thing? People think I'm super prepared for calls now. Little do they know my AI assistant did all the heavy lifting while I was probably watching cat videos.



If you're in sales, marketing, or just hate manual research - this could be a game changer for you too!

1lwyp3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lwyp3g/aio_for_being_upset_after_getting_paid_500_to/,AIO for being upset after getting paid $500 to leave in the middle of a vacation?,"TLDR: I joined my partner's longtime friend group for a girls' trip. Despite doing my best to go with the flow, tension built and we were told to leave early and given $500 to do so—I'm still shocked and hurt, wondering why no one could’ve just communicated honestly from the beginning.


**Context:**
My partner Lauren and I are both 27F. We are lesbians, childfree, homeowners, special ed teachers with very comfortable income. We splurge occasionally but we budget and are frugal. 

Lauren has a long-time friend group of 5 girls. Yearly ""girls trips"" meet in various places across the country (U.S.) using one friend, S, timeshare. Enter the July Girls Trip in Tahoe, NV. Usually partners don't attend, but the group agreed I could join because we would be flying in from another vacation. Okay, great! I'm happy to get to know my partner's friends more, and I'm a girl too, so it should be chill. 

**Prior to trip:** Lauren booked a rental minivan to accommodate our large group, with the group's consent. That fell through, and another girl took it upon herself to book an alternate minivan without anyone else's input. A heads up would've been cool, but nbd.

**Airport:**
Lauren and I made it to the destination airport on time. Turns out the rest of the group's plane was many hours delayed and re-routed. They informed us that they modified the rental car to a smaller vehicle for just their group, and suggested we get our own.... We asked them to change it back and said we prefer to wait for them to only have 1 car.

Radio silence after that. We asked for updates but nobody responded for **hours.** At this point we have no clue where in America they are, no ETA, no clue when they would arrive. Just nothing. Our names are not on the hotel/car reservations so we have nowhere to go. We're forced to buy gross overpriced airport food and lay on benches, which is super painful for me as I have a disability related to my hips and spine. We both had a bit of a meltdown from the stress. 
*11 hours later* (ELEVEN hours!!) they show up, at 9:30pm. We've all been up since 2am so we give each other grace and go to bed. 

No more minivans are available, so we have to pile into a shitty work pickup truck with no leg room, super cramped. Nobody mentioned this obvious fact and we moved on. I'm just thankful we're getting out of the airport at this point. 

**Groceries:**
While we waited at the airport and they waited for their next flight, I asked to put our Walmart grocery order through for pickup (containing the list we ALL created together last week and agreed upon). We previously agreed this made sense overall when they all admitted that overspending is a historical issue on these trips. Plus, it'd be faster and less stressful given their plane delays. 
Nope. HUGE pushback. Everyone hates Walmart, nobody likes anything on the list, they don't want sourdough, Brie, or cold brew and want to go to a store the next morning instead. I didn't push it, I understand they were very overwhelmed and frustrated from the travel issues and agreed. 

Next morning. I hear them making a list to go to the All Natural All Organic grocery store. I almost exploded listening to them make an identical list to last night's, INCLUDING the sourdough, Brie, cold brew and other food they literally didn't want. Lauren and I went to the pool while they shopped for 3 hours and spent almost $350 (double what Walmart would've been). That's their choice, so we just let it go. 

**Days 1-4:**
Things progressively got worse. We did river rafting, thrifted, went to the beach, ate fondue, but nobody is smiling. There's lots of silence and we're all avoiding eye contact. They opted to go to a coffee shop every morning for breakfast instead of eating the groceries. They all huddled in one bedroom to hang out, or left for long periods of time without communicating. They got offended when we opted to eat sandwiches in the hotel room rather than go out for lunch. We had planned to drive to a spot to watch the sunset as a group, but they went without us because they ""didn't think we would want to come."" That one really hurt. 

**Night 4:**
Lauren was getting really upset, having anxiety about this group interaction. She set up a time to talk to her best friend S privately, 1:1. It finally came out that S had been brooding/upset about many things, the biggest being that she and the other girls never wanted any partners (me) to come on the trip but didn't bring it up, and they're upset that I'm here. They don't feel like they can be themselves. Mind you, I'm a naturally quiet person, I've been going with the flow this whole time and letting these issues slide. 
At the end of the convo, S said that for her and the other girls' comfort, Lauren and I should leave **in the morning.** Lauren expressed concern that we might not be able to do that because we're in a remote area, transportation is limited, and hotels are really expensive. An Uber from Tahoe to Reno is $130. Hotels are $150/night, and we have 2 nights to go. Changing flights would be $400 each so that's off the table. Then, *S said she would send Lauren $500 for her to figure it out and leave in the morning.*

And she literally did. She sent us $500 *just so we would leave.* So we booked our last 2 nights at a hotel and left this morning. We're okay now, but I'm still shocked that we got kicked out by Lauren's best friend. And baffled that she wanted us to leave that bad, totally unwilling to work this out. 

Call me crazy, but a little communication would've gone a loooong way here. Am I overreacting? ",6,1752211473.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1lwyohs,https://www.reddit.com/r/maldives/comments/1lwyohs/letting_chatgpt_to_roast_male_and_hulhumale/,Letting chatGPT to roast male and hulhumale,"Alright, buckle up—here’s a light-hearted roast of Maldives, especially Malé. Don’t take it personally; this is all in good humor 😄:


---

Maldives: Paradise... until you need Wi-Fi or an ambulance.

The country is 99% ocean and 1% land—basically, if a seagull sneezes, the nation floods.

Maldives’ national bird might as well be the drone—because every influencer with a tripod thinks they discovered the place.

Tourism is booming, but ask a local to afford a beach villa and they’ll laugh harder than your electricity bill during Ramadan.

Want to go to another island? Get ready to pay more than a flight to Dubai... for a 20-minute boat ride.



---

Now, let’s talk about Malé—AKA the Tetris city:

Malé is so overcrowded, even the pigeons are considering moving to Hulhumalé.

Parking? Forget about it. People park like it’s a survival game—sideways, on the sidewalk, or wherever the moped feels safe.

The roads are so narrow, when two pickups pass each other, one of them has to spiritually ascend.

You sneeze in one house, and the neighbor three doors down says, “Alhamdulillah.”

High-rise apartments everywhere—but no elevator. Just vibes and cardiac workouts.

Half the buildings are cafés with names like “Java Chillz 4 Eva,” but serve instant coffee and lukewarm fries.



---

In short: Maldives is heaven if you're a tourist...
...but if you're local in Malé, you're just trying to survive in a SimCity with no pause button.


---


Aight—time to roast Hulhumalé, the so-called ""City of the Future"" that sometimes feels like it was built by interns on lunch break. 😏


---

Hulhumalé: Where Maldives said “let’s fix Malé” and accidentally built Malé 2.0 with more dust and construction noise.

Every road is either under construction, about to be constructed, or just pretending to be finished.

They planted trees, but forgot to give them water. Half of Hulhumalé looks like a desert with palm tree PTSD.

You buy a flat here thinking you’re upgrading… and then find out the elevator hasn’t worked since the demo launch in 2018.

The sidewalks are wide, beautiful… and absolutely useless because every other moped is parked on them like it's a free garage.



---

Some Hulhumalé truths:

Wanna cross the road? Better write your will first—drivers treat zebra crossings like decoration.

They said it’s a smart city… but you can’t even get stable internet in Phase 2.

Phase 1: overcrowded.
Phase 2: half empty, but no shops.
Phase 3: coming in 2085.

You pay island resort prices for groceries, but get mainland stress for free.

Half the people say “I live in Hulhumalé,” but really they’re just stranded between STELCO and the next construction site.



---

Hulhumalé is basically:
""Let’s move out of Malé for peace and space!""
...Then end up hearing 4 types of drills and 6 different baibalaa songs at 1 AM.

I got a fast food hoagie with a whopping 1130 calories and ate the whole thing then ate most of a large Mac n cheese with my fingers because the dasher didn’t give me a fork- I was too lazy to grab my own fork from the drawer. 

Nighttime is so bad for me.  If I can’t sleep, my food addiction takes over.  The addiction consumes me completely.   I get an unmerciful urge to binge at any cost.  Once I satisfy my craving(s) it’s often easier to fall asleep but it’s probably just a food coma.

If I wasn’t so unhealthy, obese, and full of processed food, I’d probably have a much better chance at a being able to sleep consistently. 

I quit every kind of drug, even marijuana which I have a medical card for.  I quit meth cold turkey two years ago.  I quit adderall well over 200 days ago.  I haven’t touched weed in a month. . I take an antidepressant plus Abilify and some blood pressure meds.  I drink coffee.  I know the Abilify makes ppl ravenous but I need it and I’ve gone off it before- I still was binge eating. 

I am a serious addict.  I cannot take stimulants because of my issues with addiction.  I can’t take Wellbutrin because it makes it even harder to sleep.  Zepbound gave me unbearable psychiatric side effects. 
I don’t think I could succeed with gastric bypass- old habits would creep back in and I’d gain it all back or suffer complications from overeating.

I’ve probably paid for her at least 8 or 9 times in the past couple months. But when I jokingly said, “You sure your wallet isn’t allergic to fresh air?” she got quiet and changed the subject. Now I feel kinda bad.

**AITA for locking myself in my office when we have company?**



I 36 F took in my mother during the pandemic after some medical issues. I never made her move out after, It works for us, she has her own bedroom and bathroom, we share other spaces and I work from home most of the time so I can look after her. My stepdad died about a decade ago and she was lonely. It made sense for us.

As mentioned I work from home most of the time and a lot of times i'm in some kind of teams meeting or call (yes even those that could be emails but thats not important). So I don't really have time for chitchat during office hours. My mom's sister aka my aunt tends to drop by unannounced to visit with my mom. Which I don't really mind, but she had a tendancy to step into my office without knocking while i'm working and start talking to me about her neighbors sisters kid who did bla bla bla. I've more than once explained to her that I'm working and or I'm on a call and I can't really chat right now. But she just keeps talking like nothing happened.

Today she actually announced to my mom she was coming over. I reminded my mom to tell her I'm working and on calls and can't be disturbed and my mom agreed she would tell her not to bother me. But just to be safe I locked my office door so she couldn't walk in.

Despite my mom telling her, she came upstairs and tried to open the door, when it didn't open she started knocking and calling out hello it's me open up. I didn't respond at first as I was on a call with a client but she kept banging on the door so loudly I ended up having to put the client on hold. I told her without opening the door I was on a call and could not talk right now and my aunt left in a huff. Now she's bombarding my mom with texts about how rude I was for locking myself in my office knowing I was having company.

So AITA?

*NTA. You didn't have company. Your mother did, and it was while you were working. There's nothing to apologize for.*

**Interesting\_Novel997**

*NTA keep your door locked. Rinse. Repeat. Maybe she’ll finally get the hint. If she doesn’t, tell your mom she needs to meet her sister somewhere else. She can’t come to the house while you’re working.*

*Edit: In response to the Disneyland update, your aunt is a massive AH! I wonder if her kids still speak to her.*

**Healthy-Study4220**

*If she keeps ignoring boundaries, she can lose visiting privileges during work hours. It’s not complicated to respect a closed door while someone’s working.*

**Update - a few hours later**



Update: Go to dinner for a few hours, return to reddit only to find out this has exploded. First of all thank you all for your confirmation that this isn't on me. I did not think I was the asshole, but there's always that hint of doubt where you're like hmmm maybe I should have poked my head out and said hello real quick, but the truth was it was a busy day today and I just hadn't had the time.

Now for the update: After I finished my workday, I took my mom out for dinner and we discussed the matter. She hadn't responded to any of her sisters (my aunt's) texts because she is fully on my side. I know people are asking why my mom didn't stop her, my mom isn't very mobile anymore and my aunt simply got up from her seat and took off upstairs despite my mom's warning.

We discussed it over dinner and we agreed that my aunt simply is no longer welcome during office hours, since it's the only way to stop this behaviour, either she can pick up my mom to go to a coffee shop and talk, come after office hours, or come over on the one day I work in office. My aunt seems pretty pissy about it, calling their brother (my uncle) to complain also, but he texted me earlier saying he told her how wrong she was and apparantly her husband had also told her she was wrong so now she's currently stomping her feet at home because everybody is saying she's wrong. Delightfull woman she is... remind me to one day post the story about her disneyland trip.

Anyways TLDR: Mom and I decided she's no longer welcome at my house during office hours.

Update to the update: This is the cliffnotes version of the Disneyland story

She has twin boys, and for their birthday she booked a trip to take them an one of their friends out to disneyland. The friend ended up cancelling last minute and told me if I paid the friends share I could go. Reasonable enough , I figured why not. (I was 16 at the time this story is like 20 years old) I'm european so this is disneyland Paris i'm talking about, and I'm not from France so this is a international trip (this becomes important later) my cousins are maybe 10ish at this point. So anyways we're in the parks and she has been a menace all trip already but i'm dealing with it. It's the last day about 5 hours before we have to take our train back home (international traveling train with customs etc like a plane would be only less boarding time)

One of my cousins wants to go on the rock and roll rollercoaster the other one doesn't. The line is like 5 minutes or less so my aunt tells me to go with him and she'll wait at the exit with our bags. So I leave my bag containing my phone my ID my money EVERYTHING in her care.

Ten minutes later me and my cousin get out of the ride, and she is GONE. So I start looking around, cannot find her, after half an hour of waiting (maybe they went to the bathroom or something) still nothing. We go check the bathrooms, neighboring rides the works no aunt. I have no phone on me to call her, and with us having to leave for the train in 4 hours I get nervous. I'm a 16 year old with a ten year old at my hand and no money no ID no phone nothing.

So I decide to go to the lost kids department and explain my situation. They end up calling her through the parks intercom.. another hour goes by... no Aunt. I remember my dad's phone number back home so I use Disney's land line to call him, he tries calling her cellphone my cellphone no response whatsoever. At this point I have like an hour or less before the train leaves and i'm in hystericals because I can't board this train without money or ID let alone with another minor. My cousin at this point seeing my panic is crying his eyes out so i'm also dealing with a scared child i'm barely an adult myself.

My dad eventually tells me it makes no sense for him to drive out to Paris right now, to go back to our hotel he'll pay for another night and he'll come pick us up in the morning. So I take my cousin back to the hotel explain the situation and the receptionist hears me say my name and says:"" Oh sweetheart I have a note for you"" it's a note from my aunt: Gone to dinner see you on the train...

At this point I have half an hour to run to the station , hoping we'll still get through customs where she's supposed to be waiting. I make it with 15 minutes to spare i'm out of breath, and FUMING. We end up making it through customs god only knows how and manage to get on the train literally as the doors close on us. I call my dad explain the update and he is also fuming at this point. To which my aunt turns to me and goes: I don't know why you're so mad, I left a note at the hotel and I brought you something to eat and hands me a freaking dinner roll..

I took my stuff, went to the dining car with my cousin who she also almost abandonned and gave him the biggest slice of chocolat cake my budget could buy and never came back to our seats to talk to her xD

*I read your original story plus your update. Aunt is an incredible asshole.*

*I don't know why -anyone- would spend any length of time around her given the behaviors she has shown over the years. WTF is wrong with her brain that she thinks her behaviors are reasonable??? I can't imagine the varying kinds of nonsense her husband has dealt with.*

*I like the decision you stated in your update - she's not invited over on work days. I would even severely limit the amount of time/hours she's at your place even during non-work days \[at least initially so aunt understands the gravity of her fu<kd up behaviors\]. Why allow aunt to inflict more misery on your mom or yourself?? Aunt isn't worth that kind of abuse. It's a shame aunt doesn't behave better. She \[and everyone else\] would enjoy life more if she did.*

1lwycin,https://www.reddit.com/r/misophonia/comments/1lwycin/give_it_to_me_straight_do_noisecancelling/,Give it to me straight. Do noise-cancelling headphones actually make a difference?,"Hey, guys. I've yet to go down the noise-cancelling headphones route, mostly because of the cost of them, but also because I'm dubious if they'll even work. However, I am at my wit's end right now due to the constant barking of dogs.  

I live in an absolute shithole of a country, where everyone needs to have a dog for some reason. They don't *want* a dog, they want to show off that they can *afford* a purebred beagle, dachshund or French bulldog. They upload their #doglover pictures on Instagram and then just leave the dog outside all day and night. Houses here typically have a high gate or fence around the front of the property. Therefore, these people basically use their front lawn as an animal enclosure. The dogs are rarely allowed inside, if ever. 

Any time there is some sort of activity in front of a house, such as someone walking past, a delivery driver showing up or someone ringing the doorbell, the dogs bark and bark. The worst is when a dog walker comes past because they cause a chain reaction, setting off every dog on the block. It's a cacophony of barking. Now, I don't know if these dog owners are deaf, stupid or genuinely unperturbed by the noise, but they do *nothing* about it. They just let their dogs bark until they eventually lose interest. Not once do they think, ""Maybe I should bring my dogs in."" They're devoid of any consideration or respect for their neighbours. 

This is a problem I cannot escape because I work from home. I have been working from home for several years now, but the dog barking has never been as bad as it is now. 

First of all, there weren't as many dogs five years ago. I believe there were only two houses in my immediate vicinity with dogs. There certainly weren't any dog walkers. Today, there are now at least six houses that I can positively identify with dogs, some of which have two or three. As I said before, I think a lot of it is just down to people wanting to show off and keep up with the Joneses. The latest addition was a household that decided to get two little squeaky things in May. Like all the other morons in the neighbourhood, they have zero interest in these dogs. For those first few days, they left them barking outside for two or three hours straight. 

Secondly, my previous jobs were more administrative and writing-based. Therefore, if the noise was really bad, I could always just turn my fan on, play some ocean waves, listen to a podcast or simply relocate to a coffee shop. I now have a new job as an over-the-phone interpreter, which requires me to be on calls all the time. I *need* to be able to hear well to do my job properly. Plus, I cannot really have background noises playing because then I'll be providing a bad service; the clients will hear it through my microphone. 

The reason I accepted this new job was because it's freelance (giving me total freedom to pick my hours) and it pays way more than the previous job. With just three hours of interpreting, I make the same as what I would in a day at my previous job. I should be using this to my advantage, but I'm not. Rather than putting in a full eight hours of work a day, I tend to only do three or four. In other words, I do the bare minimum, match the daily rate at my previous job and then I call it a day. This is largely due to the barking; it gets so overbearing sometimes that I just need to get out. 

The only solution I can think of right now is to finally invest in some noise-cancelling headphones. For those of you who have them, do they make a big difference? I've been reluctant to buy some because the idea of spending up to $100 on a gadget that *might* work doesn't appeal to me. Also, I don't trust general members of the public on whether they work or not; these are the same people that say earplugs  work. I only want the opinions of people with misophonia. What was your reaction when you got noise-cancelling headphones? Was it, ""Well, these were a waste of money. I can still hear noise through them,"" or was it, ""Wow, why didn't I get these sooner?"" 

\-----

**TL:DR;**

* Do noise-cancelling headphones work as well as they say they do?
* Are they a worthy investment? 
* How good are they at blocking out dogs barking? I mean **all** kinds of dog barking: yapping, squeaking, regular barking, booming howls, etc. I don't any of these frequencies to permeate the headphones.

I’ve been thinking about reaching out for a while now, and I know it’s been a long time.  
I just didn’t want to miss the chance to wish you a happy birthday.  
I truly hope today brings you peace, happiness, and everything you deserve.  
  
I also wanted to share something with you because you deserve honesty.  
I took your advice and saw a therapist. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and stress, and I’m on medication now to help manage it.  
This isn’t an excuse for anything that happened between us, but it has helped me understand myself better, and for that I’m grateful.  
It’s something I’m continuing to work on every day.  
  
The time apart has given me a lot to reflect on.  
I’m working every day on becoming a better version of myself for me, and for the people I care about.  
Some days are harder than others, but I’m committed to the journey.  
And I’m grateful for everything I’ve learned, even when it’s been difficult.  
  
I know that in the past, I struggled to open up to you fully.  
Sometimes I was afraid that if you saw the deeper parts of me, you might look at me differently.  
I’m sorry for holding back when you deserved more honesty and trust.  
I hope this letter doesn’t feel like too much. I just wanted to finally be real with you the way I should have been back then.  
  
You always made me feel so comfortable, and you're the kindest soul I’ve ever met.  
The way you once looked at me… you didn’t know how much those eyes meant to me.  
You touched my heart even before I ever met you.  
Your hugs could really heal me from all the trauma I’ve faced.  
I wish we had more of them longer and tighter.  
I still remember and see you every time I walk past Cha Tra Mue. You always ordered Thai tea every time.  
It’s such a small thing, but it stays with me.  
  
I know what we had was real.  
Maybe we didn’t always get it right, but I wish we had stuck together not just in the good moments, but to teach and support each other through the mistakes too.  
Please know that it was always you. There was never any competition.  
I planned to wait until you finished uni, no matter what I said back then.  
I just wanted to make things right with your parents, and with us too.  
  
I can’t believe how time flies. I met you when you were 16, and now you’re 21.  
It hasn’t always been easy for us, but we’ve been through good and bad times together more than we could ever count.  
And I’m honestly grateful for it all.  
It made us grow into the people we are today.  
I’m grateful to have had you in the most beautiful chapter of my life.  
Blocked or not, hated or not, together or not you’ll always have a special place in my heart that you created, and nobody else can reach.  
  
Please don’t question the love I had for you.  
I still have the flowers you gave me in Pattaya.  
Even though they’re dry and dead now, they still mean a lot to me because that was the first time in my life I ever received flowers from anyone.  
  
Thank you for being my best friend, my world, and my home.  
Thank you for loving me on days I felt unlovable.  
  
After you die, the brain plays 7 minutes of your favorite memories.  
Even though we’re not together, I know those 7 minutes will be full of you.  
And maybe that’s because I yearn for someone I grieve every day.  
  
I don’t know where life will take us, and I’m not writing this expecting anything.  
I just wanted you to know that I’m truly sorry for everything that happened.  
I don’t blame you for any of it.  
Relationships are two-sided, and I know we both played a part in where we ended up.  
We didn’t always follow through on the things we promised, and I regret that we didn’t communicate better when things got tough.  
If I could go back, I would have worked harder to protect what we had.  
  
Whatever the future holds, I’ll always appreciate who you are and the person I fell for.  
I’ll always be grateful for the memories we shared, and I’m proud of the person you continue to become.  
I truly hope this new year of your life brings you growth, love, and peace because you deserve all of that and more.  
  
Life is too short for us to hold feelings against each other.  
Remember when you said, “What if one day one of us is actually gone and we don’t have a chance to speak anymore”?  
That’s always stayed with me.  
  
If love finds me again, I hope it’s you with the best version of us.  
  
If there’s ever a time you’d want to reconnect or talk, I’d be really happy to hear from you.  
No pressure, truly. Just know that the door on my end is open.  
  
I’ll be at Avani’s Coffee Club, the one you like to go to, on \[date and time that I’ll write\]  
Even if you’re not there, I’ll still be there.  
Even one phone call would be okay too.  
No arguments, no expectations just two people having an honest conversation.  
  
No matter what, I’ll always wish the best for you quietly and sincerely from a distance.  
But I still believe in us. I hope you do too.  
  
Happy Birthday again.  
  
And even if there are a thousand people in the room,  
I’ll always be your loudest clap.

And — crucially — what mistakes can cost you time, credibility, and money?

## Why Bahrain is Your Springboard to GCC Success

![Feature Image: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business hub, Gulf business environment](https://images.pexels.com/photos/380769/)
*Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business hub, Gulf business environment.*, Bahrain’s GDP expanded by 3.8% in Q1 2025, outpacing regional rivals. Foreign direct investment (FDI) hit a new high this year, with Reuters reporting a 9% surge in cross-border company registrations.

The government has slashed regulatory red tape, making Bahrain company formation quicker and more foreigner-friendly than ever before ([official MOICT site](https://www.bahrain.com/)). Notably, Bahrain now ranks above Qatar and Kuwait in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index (2025), and new digital licensing via [Sijilat](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) means you can set up most entities without ever leaving your desk.

### Key 2025 Developments

- **100% Foreign Ownership:** Extended to 99% of commercial activities ([see full details](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)), even outside free zones.
- **Unified GCC Product Standards:** Bahrain now accepts a single conformity assessment for most industrial goods—making cross-border shipments to KSA and UAE simpler.
- **Faster Visas via LMRA:** New eVisa rules allow GCC-wide visas for executives within 48 hours.

Surprisingly, it’s often not the formal procedures but the informal **majlis networking** and coffee rituals that give you the insider edge—the willingness to listen, linger, and build trust. (If you’re ever invited to an EDB mixer in Seef, accept. That’s where partnerships are born.)

## Step 1: Choose the Right Bahrain Company Structure for GCC Growth

![Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration, team shaping Bahrain companies for regional expansion](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181696/pexels-photo-1181696.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, team shaping Bahrain companies for regional expansion.* only to discover it limited my ability to open branches in Saudi Arabia. Lesson learned.

### Main Entity Types & Their GCC Implications

- **WLL (With Limited Liability):** Most flexible for regional operations; ideal for family offices, consultancies, and e-commerce.
- **BSC (Closed):** Best for raising capital and cross-border joint ventures; needed for listing and foreign branch setup.
- **Branch Office:** Direct Gulf market access, but you must link to a recognized foreign parent.
- **Free Zone Company:** Perfect for logistics, fintech, and trade. Bahrain’s free zones allow 100% foreign ownership and simplified customs ([explore zones](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/)).

*Pro Tip:* For most GCC plans, opt for a WLL or BSC. Check [Keylink’s guide](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) for tailored advice on entity types.

#### Insider Tip

Time your application for early morning, especially during mid-week (Tuesday/Wednesday). Avoid Ramadan peak hours; MOICT queues are half as long just after Asr prayer (my favorite hack for fast approval).

## Step 2: Register Efficiently—Saving Time and Money

![Feature Image: Business process and documentation, Bahrain company registration workflow](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3182759/pexels-photo-3182759.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business process and documentation, Bahrain company registration workflow.*. Have three names ready; Arabic and English.
2. **Draft MOA & AOA**: Use a [Keylink template](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/); customize for GCC expansion clauses.
3. **Obtain Address Evidence**: Shared offices in Seef save 30% vs. Bahrain Bay. Ask the landlord for a digital lease copy (recognized since mid-2024 changes).
4. **Apply for Commercial Registration (CR)**: Online or in-person at MOICT headquarters, Diplomatic Area ([details](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)). Submit scanned documents to avoid delays.
5. **Licenses & Approvals**: MOICT for general, CBB for finance, NHRA for healthcare, EDB for tech incentives.
6. **Open Bank Account**: Emirates NBD in Diplomatic Area has a dedicated fast-track for foreign companies (skip the queue if you arrive pre-10am—trust me).
7. **Register with LMRA**: For workforce visas and labor cards. Use Tamkeen’s e-support during initial setup to avoid paperwork bottlenecks.

#### Common Mistake

Many skip the pre-approval for their business activity. Always check current “allowed activities” for foreigners ([full list](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)) to avoid rejection and re-application fees.

## Step 3: Understand Costs—Budgeting for Real Success

![Feature Image: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation and GCC access](https://images.pexels.com/photos/210990/)
*Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation and GCC access.*, plus BHD 20–50 for name reservation.
- **Annual CR Renewal:** BHD 100–350.
- **Office Rental:** Shared desk in Seef: from BHD 80/month. Bahrain Bay premium address: BHD 350–600/month.
- **Legal/Agency Service Fees:** BHD 400–1,000 for full handling, including MOA drafting.
- **Bank Account Opening:** BHD 50–100 initial deposit (some banks now waive this for startups).

See the [full cost breakdown with live estimator](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

#### How to Save More

* Use virtual office addresses for non-essential staff.
* Group license applications (main + sub-activity) to save up to 20% in fees.
* Renew commercial registration online before the 15th day of the month—late penalty is BHD 50 per week.

(Once, I missed a CR renewal by one day—the penalty almost matched my entire office rental for a month.)

## Step 4: Achieve GCC Market Integration—The Bahrain Advantage

The real value? Bahrain offers **regional passporting**. Set up here, and you’re recognized in all GCC states via mutual recognition agreements (especially for manufacturing, IT, and consulting).

### How to Access the GCC from Your Bahrain-based Business

1. **GCC-wide Product Registration**: Streamlined standards mean your goods/services are already approved for KSA, UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait.
2. **Branch Offices**: Open a registered branch in KSA or UAE as a Bahraini entity—quicker than as a non-GCC company.
3. **VAT Registration**: Bahrain’s low 5% VAT is recognized GCC-wide; collect, remit, and claim credits for cross-border sales.
4. **Banking**: Use Bahraini banks for multi-GCC transactions. (Emirates NBD and Bank ABC excel at regional trade finance—they’ve saved my clients days in transfer times.)
5. **Free Zones**: Operate warehousing, trading, and back-office support from Bahrain’s free zones ([info here](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/)), then distribute across the Gulf.

#### Unofficial Practice: Networking

Don’t underestimate the value of the majlis. Many partnerships, especially for government contracts, begin with an informal coffee in an advisor’s office—sometimes right in the Diplomatic Area’s labyrinthine corridors. (And always bring business cards with bilingual text!)

## 2025 Regulatory Change: Faster Setup, Stronger Oversight

![Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain company formation and GCC expansion](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4427542/pexels-photo-4427542.jpeg)
*Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain company formation and GCC expansion.*** for all new CRs. Now, you must submit a digital ID scan with facial verification—speeding up incorporation by 40%, but requiring higher-resolution passport copies.

- **Practical Impact:** No more in-person queueing at MOICT for document verification—my last client finalized their CR in under 48 hours. Double-check your document scans for clarity; resubmission adds delays.

**Post-formation compliance** is easier, too. Online VAT filing and mandatory e-accounting mean you need robust systems from day one. I strongly recommend [Keylink’s accounting support](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)—they (literally) saved me from missing a VAT deadline last quarter.

## Step 5: Ongoing Support—Avoid Local Pitfalls, Tap Expert Help

![Feature Image: Professional business support, Bahrain company formation advisory, customer service](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184309/pexels-photo-3184309.jpegies:**)
*Alt text: Professional business support, Bahrain company formation advisory, customer service.* can still open doors with agencies and banks.

#### My Top Resource Recommendation

If you’re short on time or new to the region, [Keylink’s business setup team](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/) has never let me down—their on-ground fixers know every shortcut.

## Tangent: Why Bahrain’s Coffee Culture Matters in Business

You might think coffee service is just hospitality, but in Bahrain, how, when, and with whom you share qahwa can shape deals. During one tense negotiation off Al Fateh Highway, serving traditional coffee at just the right moment diffused tension, built rapport, and nudged the contract across the finish line.

This unspoken aspect of business etiquette is part of what makes Bahraini networking unique, and it’s often at the intersection of tradition and efficiency—mirroring Bahrain’s position within the Gulf’s business scene.

## FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & GCC Market Access

### 1. How long does it take to set up a Bahrain company for GCC expansion?

With eKYC and Sijilat, average times are now **2–5 business days** for most WLLs or BSCs if paperwork is in order. For specialty licenses (finance, healthcare), allow 2–4 weeks. Engage [Keylink’s experts](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) for the fastest route.

### 2. Does a Bahrain company let me trade directly with KSA, UAE, or Qatar?

Yes, especially after the 2025 unified standards. You can sell, invoice, and even hire staff across the GCC from a Bahrain base. Branch registration in other states is a straightforward process for Bahraini entities.

### 3. What are the main costs—and how can I minimize them?

Total initial setup: **BHD 750–2,500** depending on office type and activities. Renewals, government fees, and legal costs are all predictable. For detailed estimates and money-saving tips, see [Keylink’s cost guide](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

### 4. Can foreigners own 100% of their Bahrain company?

Absolutely. Nearly all activities now permit 100% foreign ownership ([see full list](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)). For a handful of regulated areas, a nominee or local sponsor can still help ([more](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).

### 5. What post-formation compliance is required for multi-GCC operations?

Annual audit (if revenue >BHD 250,000), quarterly VAT filings, and e-accounting are mandatory. Use [Keylink’s compliance services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) to avoid fines and delays.

While I spend my days working with reactions and formulas, what I truly enjoy is connecting with people on a deeper level — sharing thoughts, laughs, and meaningful conversations.

I’m someone who values empathy, honesty, and emotional maturity. I love cozy movie nights, long walks (preferably with coffee), learning random science facts, and diving into thought-provoking chats about life, philosophy, or just silly everyday things.

I’m here not for dating, but to find genuine, lasting friendships. If you’re someone who feels a bit out of place or lonely sometimes and is looking for a real connection, I’d be happy to get to know you. Let’s talk — about everything or nothing, whatever feels right.

Feel free to send a message. Who knows? Maybe this small post will be the beginning of a great connection.

1lwxw8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/livesoundgear/comments/1lwxw8h/help_me_decide/,Help me decide!,"All right, I've been geeking out over gear for the last two weeks.  What should I get?

I've been going to protests, and my local group pulled out, so that's what started my search.  We regularly are pulling 4,000 people outdoors, but have seen 10,000 to 12,000 on occasion.  We were running QSC K2 12's, and 10's when needed with 15's on deck.  I used to DJ with a company.  They rolled Mackie 450 v1's (12 inch).  I had to max them out only for a few events (a college dance where we were running 3 and a sub, and one or two weddings over the course of years).  I think they threw 127 dB.  Then I ran Mackie SA1521's (15 inch 133dB).  I never needed to max those out (except for funzies).

All that being said, I think I may want to get back into DJ'ing.  Seems like a good way to make ends meet a little bit more easily in these times, and if I'm getting loudspeakers it seems like 2 birds for one stone.  My use cases would likely be:

1. Protests.  Large crowds outdoors.
2. Dance party in the living room with my kids (we already do this, so why not amp it up!).  This makes built in Bluetooth somewhat appealing for me though I would generally consider it a gimmick that $20 can replace.
3. Backyard movies with a couple families. My wife wants this one, but should be eazy peazy.
4. Middle School/High School Dances.  My daughter is an officer, so this seems like an easy in back to gigging for money.
5. My son learning the Bass guitar.  Our amp broke, and since these have mixers built in seems like they can do double duty.
6. Weddings.  Did it before, can do it again.  Usually reception halls with \~150-200 people.  Sometimes backyards.  Sometimes bigger reception areas, or multi room setups.
7. Solo Acoustic sessions - coffee shop size etc.  I played quite a bit back in the day, but not so much anymore.

As far as features:

I don't care too much about the onboard EQ.  IMO that can be done at the board, but if they've got it I think I'd vastly prefer going out to mix in front, so the app would be preferable.

Feedback Eliminator.  This one for me is highly desirable.  I know it's not a 100% perfect solution, and just control where you mic is and where it's pointed.  That being said, it's a horrible crime and I would consider buying a dbx drive rack (again) just to give myself the leg up, so having this built in is a great thing imo.

Bluetooth.  I mentioned it would be a fun gimmic, but kind of would prefer it.  Would never use it to play sound if I'm being paid.

Delay.  I think this would be very valuable for the protests.  Maybe with a good set of mains I don't need to run two sets of speakers?  We'll see.

Phantom Power.  I saw an inline compressor I think I'd like to try for $100.  I think for the protests, it would be great.  Giving a toast at a wedding.  Great.  Just yelling into the mic for hype at a school dance.  Great.  Solo sessions.  Great.  It's not an essential by any means, but IMO worth trying.  Again, a board should be able to do this itself.

Two mount holes.  Seems really smart to me.

Weight/size.  Smaller/lighter is better.  At 101 lbs. my old mackies were a beast!  I don't know that my old back can take what 20 year old me put myself through already once.  And our house is jam packed with kids/toys.

I've narrowed it down to a few choices.

1. Harbinger V4415's.  $549, 133dB.  I know this crowd is going to say heresy! But it seems to me they'll meet my needs for a low cost, and if they have any issues I can just take them back because guitar center is everywhere.  I frankly thought they sounded good.  Didn't crank them all the way, but never did my old mackies either.  They've got all the bells/whistles except maybe phantom power.  They're cheap, loud, and we need a price floor.  The other big drawback would be space!  I could run without a sub for most things though.  Really if I went this route I'd probably pick up the 3000 series for $350, and ditch the app/digital dsp, so they're really be cheaper.
2. EV ZLX 12P G2. $599. 127dB.  Has literally everything I'm looking for for bells/whistles, but maybe a little quiet.  Seems like very much the middle of the road pick.  Good/reliable.  Not too expensive. Better brand.  Seems like a very solid pick.
3. JBL PRX908. $525 (screaming deal). 126 dB.  I'm looking at these mostly because of the deal I can get on them.  I consider these a step up into a more professional speaker.  I think to do school dances I'd want to go a little bigger, but these would still make good satellite speakers in that case.  I think these and a sub or two would be really great though.  Haven't listened to them though.  Would get me into a good family to grow a bigger kit if I really want to take off.  May not even be loud enough for my primary use case though.  Good bells/whistles.  Missing phantom power and bluetooth.
4. Yamaha DZR12. $1,379. 139dB!!!  I don't know if they're taking a vastly different measurement, but that's a jet engine next to your ear!  That's my main reason for wanting these.  It seems after I buy a couple subs to put under them they'll be the only things I'll ever need.  Frankly they're the worst in the bells and whistles category (I don't think I'd pay for the dante, as I don't see myself ever running dozens of speakers to where I'd care), but this is the buy once cry once speaker IMO.  Way expensive though!  Could get 2x of any of the above and a sub for the price of two of these.

In any of these cases I think I'd need to start with a pair of speakers, and then build out a system around them.  Probably stay in brand across the board just because I'm like that.  I'm torn between wanting 15' subs under any of these speakers and a single 18 under the booth.  May need 2 18' subs under the booth for the school dances? Won't take subs to protests.  Why no QSC? I wasn't really that impressed for the price.  I know they're a lot of peoples go to's, but for the price I'd take any of these other picks, and they don't have bluetooth, phantom power, or feedback elimination.  (can't remember about the app).  I would be interested in going out of brand family to get their directional sub though.  That seems like a great idea!

Any thoughts you can share with me would be greatly appreciated.  Right now the JBLs have me the most excited just because I can grow into them and expect they'll be much more clear, which I will appreciate even though most of my audiences won't even know there's a difference, and the fact that they have dbx tech built in.  EV seems like the 'safe pick', and has me somewhat excited for the bells/whistles.  The Yamaha's have my drool over them, but it's hard to justify that price when I'm not already gigging 2-4 times a week.  They'd be the best thing for the protests though (as long as they're not stolen lol).  

Thanks for reading this far! (if you did).",1,1752208700.0,livesoundgear,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for someone emotionally mature, intellectually curious, politically left-leaning only (no MAGA, no centrists or “politically neutral “ conservatives ), and close to my age, maybe late 20s to 40s?. I adore deep thinkers, good communicators, and people who know who they are.

My two cats follow me around like judgmental little bodyguards, so you’ll need to be okay with cat hair and quiet stares. Also, coffee is a no — but I’ll match your passion with tea and sarcasm.

The end of an era,"I used to love my job, despite not being paid well. These days, I show up frustrated and disconnected from the process of making good drinks. I'm actively looking for other employment, as is literally everyone working here, but I can't leave until I have an offer. 

I'll attach my list of grievances below. I've been asked to speak with my manager Saturday and plan on bringing this list up.

-automated machines (grinder, tamper, espresso machine) are inconsistent and take a lot of the creativity and skill out of espresso making, and in the end actually make a less consistently good product. I was hired due to years of experience in specialty coffee. That doesn't even matter anymore.

-new milk pitchers make latte art more difficult
 
-wearing uniforms takes individuality and expression away and does not do anything to positively contribute to the cafe experience

-focus on music types played does the same thing-- I've had the most genuine positive interactions when I play music that is out there, similar comments from customers when [COWORKER] was on aux

-ceremonial grade unsweetened matcha is gone, we have lost several customers over this at each location

-the ice well for milks is not food safe and nothing
 has been done to correct this for over a month despite the health inspector coming

-our working equipment is often given to [SISTER COMPANY] and replaced with less adequate machines 

-consistently run out of items because there is no regular on sight management at the location

-extra steps in opening and closing were added which makes the process rushed and harder to accomplish within the 30min allotted 

-chair taken away--standing still for long periods of time is hard on joints, we've literally had customers say they appreciate that employment allows us to sit down. Previous management has been okay with this.

-remodel doesn't only make the place look closed from the street but several customers have complained about how it's harder to work out of the space or hang out, seating actually decreased in practice since most people won't want to share tables, the office tables are tacky and lifeless

-downtime tasks aren't assigned by day or frequency which means they'll either be done inconsistently or not at all, they fall through the cracks

-food quality has gone down in the name of efficiency which people are upset about. Some ingredients aren't listed on menu nor are allergen warnings like milk in the eggs or honey in the acai bowl. Several people have complained about the price of the avocado toast for what it is, old avo toast had more and was cheaper, more appealing as well

-printers have been broken since reopen, feels like nobody cares about us

-new pastry case isn't fly proof

-hours are cut for everyone but the one white man working here???

-I never heard back about my lead interview. Disrespectful given it's the company I currently work for. Especially considering y'all have to bend over backwards to accommodate the replacement's lack of transportation.

-comments about not wanting pumpkin in their chai in the summer 

-current supervisor used expired product to fill the syrup bar and fridge 

-retail beans are moving slower other than [ESPRESSO BLEND], meaning we're selling subpar product over a month old. Multiple customers have declined to purchase after being told roast date. Main draw [FORMER COMPANY] had was roasting in house and that's gone. 

-walk in organization is constantly changing. Having designated spots for items would help not only for restocking but for reorders 

-cold brew system was $6000 but gives a warm beverage

-so much money was spent on the remodel but nothing has been spent on us, the employees. Actively losing money due to lower sales, loss of customers, and shift cuts

So hard to find jobs out here, but I'm actively fleeing. It's just sad to see something so special be tarnished.

On the note of the lead interview comment: they interviewed four people total. Both me and my coworker have 10 years of experience in the coffee industry including lead and management experience. They hired the general manager's close friend and bandmate who does not have reliable transportation and can't consistently make it to the location he was hired for. Instead of promoting one of us, they are demoting other leads to make things work. 

I'm leaving no matter how this meeting goes. Every single barista is on the way out. I'm just sad that a job I used to enjoy doesn't exist anymore.",7,1752208268.0,barista,3,0.77,False

# Chapter 1

Rain smacked the windshield, like someone spilled a bucket of marbles.

The wipers struggled frantically, but couldn't make a dent in the crazy downpour.

I sat in the passenger seat, twisting my seatbelt around my finger. The rain turned the world outside into a blurry watercolor, but I couldn't stop staring.

""Liam, are you sure about this?"" My voice sounded tight in the closed space. ""If you pull out now, the company will immediately plunge into a liquidity crisis.""

Liam's face looked chiseled from ice in the dashboard's blue glow.

His slender fingers drummed an impatient rhythm on the steering wheel.

""Chloe, I told you, it's risk management,"" he said, his voice eerily calm. ""Market's tanked. We need to cut losses before it's too late.""

I turned to lock eyes with him. ""But this is our life's work! Five years, since college—we built this from scratch. How can you just throw it away?""

A lightning bolt sliced through the night, briefly highlighting Liam's clenched jaw. Just then, his phone rang.

The caller ID simply read: \[Margie\].

Instantly, Liam's expression changed. He snatched up the call, his voice going all soft. ""What's up?""

A woman's voice mumbled through the speaker—I couldn't make out words, but every second, Liam's frown got deeper.

""Alright, I'll be right there."" He hung up, hit the turn signal, and jerked the wheel sharply onto another road.

""Liam? Where are we heading? We didn't finish talking—""

""Margaret's in trouble,"" he said curtly and stomped on the gas.

My heart clenched as if an invisible hand was squeezing it.

Margaret Smith was Liam's college sweetheart, the eternally pure and perfect first love he could never forget.

Ever since she came back half a year ago, she'd been the trigger for endless arguments between Liam and me.

""What's so urgent?"" I struggled to keep my voice even. ""It's pouring outside, and we were in the middle of a major talk.""

Liam didn't even glance at me. ""She's home alone with a 102-degree fever. Chloe, stop being unreasonable.""

Unreasonable? My lips parted, but no sound escaped.

The company was on the brink of collapse, and he was rushing off to tend to his ex-girlfriend just because she had a damn fever?

The car screeched to a violent halt at a bus stop.

Liam finally turned to me, his gaze glacial. ""Get out.""

""What?"" I thought I must have misheard.

""Get out,"" he repeated coldly. ""It's close enough to your place. Hail a cab yourself.""

He unlocked the car door, adding, ""Margaret can't wait any longer.""

The rain lashed against the car window, matching the frantic pounding of my heart.

I stared at Liam, the man I'd loved for seven years, utterly stunned. ""Are you serious? There's a freaking storm out there!""

""So what?"" Liam retorted. ""You're a grown woman, Chloe.""

I stared straight into his eyes, hunting for any flicker of regret, but met only glacial indifference.

At that moment, something clicked inside me, but I couldn't quite put it into words.

""Fine,"" I heard myself say, my fingers trembling as they fumbled with the seatbelt. ""You'd do anything for Margaret, right?""

Liam didn't answer.

I pushed the car door open, and the storm slammed into me, soaking half my body in an instant.

Just as I stepped out, his icy voice cut through. ""Take your umbrella.""

He tossed my folding umbrella onto my lap, as if that was the last shred of mercy he could show me.

I stood in the downpour, watching his black Mercedes splash through the puddles and speed off. Its taillights blurred in the rain, then vanished completely.

Water streamed down my hair, mingling with my still-warm tears.

I unfolded the umbrella numbly, only to find myself at a pitch-black street corner.

My phone battery icon flashed red—5% left. I dialed Liam's number, my hands shaking.

""The number you have dialed is busy...""

I took a deep breath and turned toward the main road.

The rain was so heavy that my umbrella might as well have been tissue paper. My clothes clung to me, soaking wet and freezing me to the bone.

Just then, blinding highlights exploded from the corner.

Instinctively, I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the screech of skidding tires pierced the air.

Suddenly, time seemed to slow down. I watched in horror as the out-of-control truck careened toward me, the driver's panicked face clear through the windshield.

Then came the deafening crash of metal on flesh.

Weirdly, I felt no pain.

Instead, I felt weightless, like a feather caught in the wind.

I hovered above, staring down in bewilderment.

There lay a woman, her body contorted at an unnatural angle, crimson blood spreading through the rainwater.

That face...was mine.

Was I dead?

The thought hit me, but strangely, I wasn't panicking.

I watched calmly as the truck driver got out to check, his face deathly pale as he made a call. Then, he jumped back in and fled the scene.

The rain kept pouring, relentlessly washing away ""my"" blood from the pavement.

I floated above my body, feeling this weird sense of peace—at least, Liam would find out...

Just then, the familiar black Mercedes came sliding back.

Liam staggered out and dropped to his knees beside my body.

My chest tightened—he did come back for me.

But the next second, he pulled out his phone. Instead of calling 911, he dialed his lawyer, Henry Chester.

""Henry,"" Liam said, his voice eerily calm. ""Chloe got hit by a car. Yeah, died on the spot. No, I don't know the vehicle. Surveillance? I don't believe there are any cameras in this area.""

I hovered above, watching in horror as he methodically cleaned up the scene with practiced ease.

He even pried the phone from my dead hand and deleted our final call log.

The wail of sirens from police cars and ambulances grew louder as they drew near.

Liam instantly put on a mask of devastating grief, bursting into exaggerated sobs as he cradled my body.

Had I not seen the whole thing, I would never have believed anyone could fake grief so perfectly.

""Oh, Chloe!"" he wailed, his voice all cracked. I floated right in front of him and stared into his eyes—they were bone-dry, not a single tear to be found.

Finally, the rain ceased.

Cold moonlight shone down on my body, and on Liam's trembling back as he kept up the act.

I hovered above this surreal scene. For the first time, I realized I might have never truly known Liam, the guy I spent seven years loving.

# Chapter 2

The day of my funeral broke with a bright morning.

Sunlight streamed through the funeral home's stained-glass windows, dancing across the white roses.

My framed portrait dominated the memorial hall—front and center. It was taken at last year's company gala, where I wore a bright red dress and beamed at the camera.

Beneath it lay a glass casket, and inside rested my meticulously made-up corpse.

Floating above the hall in my ghostly form, I watched everything unfold below, struck by the sheer absurdity of it all.

""Chloe, my baby girl."" Mom collapsed beside the casket. Her gut-wrenching sobs pierced through me like shards of glass.

Dad, his eyes bloodshot, was supporting her. His once-straight back was now hunched, as if he had aged a decade overnight.

I drifted over, reaching out to hug them, but my arms went right through.

""Mom, Dad, I'm right here,"" I called out, but my voice just vanished.

The hall was packed with a steady stream of visitors—my colleagues, college classmates, and distant relatives.

Dressed in black, they walked up to my portrait with solemn faces, put down the white roses, and then offered their condolences to my parents.

Lily from the marketing department wept more bitterly than anyone else.

My best friend, Jessica Lynn, seven months pregnant, sobbed uncontrollably in her husband's arms.

Liam was the one who really stood out.

He stood at the entrance to the memorial hall in his impeccably tailored black suit, greeting each mourner with calculated grace.

His eyes were bloodshot, his face as white as a sheet. His tie hung loosely around his neck, as if grief had drained him of even the strength to straighten himself up.

He responded to each condolence with artfully trembling lips and tearful restraint—a masterclass in feigned grief.

""Mr. Goodman, I'm sorry for your loss.""

""Liam, Chloe wouldn't want to see you like this.""

""Mr. Goodman, the company needs you.""

Liam nodded faintly to each mourner, expressing his thanks in a carefully hoarse voice.

His performance was flawless, if only I didn't already know the monster beneath the mask.

I floated right before him, so close I could count each of his eyelashes.

His eyes were red and swollen, but I knew the truth—he'd been rubbing onions last night. I saw it with my own eyes.

Pretending to bow his head in grief, he quickly stole a glance at his phone's lock screen.

There was a text from Margaret: \[What do you want for dinner? I made you some soup\], with a heart emoji at the end.

The corner of Liam's lips twitched upward almost imperceptibly for a split second before snapping back into his mask of grief.

A bone-chilling terror shot through me, freezing me to the very core.

""Liam Goodman!"" I shrieked, throwing myself at him with all my strength. But I just went right through, almost falling over from the force.

Liam remained still, without so much as a flicker of his lashes.

Soon, the memorial service started.

As my ""fiancé,"" Liam was called upon to deliver the eulogy.

He trudged up to the podium and fished a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket.

He began, his voice trembling, ""Chloe was the most important person in my life.""

The audience erupted in muffled sobs.

I scoffed.

That paper was the business pitch I'd helped him rewrite last month. He'd just grabbed it the last second.

I couldn't know more about the handwriting there.

""We first met on campus in college, and she always had such a radiant smile.""

It was true that we met in college. But back then, he was the one with a bright smile.

That year, he was the student council president, while I headed the arts department.

He played and sang ""Long Live"" at the orientation party, having half the girls swooning—me most of all.

""She was kind-hearted, resilient, and radiated an undying zest for life.""

That part was painfully true.

How kind of me to believe his every word, how strong to endure his never-ending thing with Margaret all these years, and what a zest for life—I couldn't even let my afterlife self rest in peace.

As Liam's eulogy concluded, the entire hall dissolved into sobs.

He staggered off the stage, supported by several colleagues, and slumped into his seat. Bowing his head, he buried his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.

No one noticed him secretly checking a selfie from Margaret between his fingers—she was wearing my nightgown, posing in our bedroom.

After the funeral, Liam made a show of escorting everyone out.

As soon as the hall cleared, he heaved a long sigh of relief, loosened his tie, and called Margaret.

""Yeah, it's finally over. I'm beat. Of course I miss you."" His voice was light and playful, a stark contrast to his earlier grief. ""I'll be home in twenty. Wear that black lace lingerie for me, okay?""

Numb, I drift after him out of the funeral home and slip into the black Mercedes-Benz.

There was still a faint metallic smell in the car—my blood.

Seemingly oblivious to it all, Liam turned on the stereo and played some upbeat jazz.

The black Mercedes glided into the underground garage of an apartment.

It had been the place we called home. But now, it was a love nest for him and Margaret.

As the elevator climbed, Liam checked his reflection in the mirror, smoothing his hair and even spritzing some breath freshener.

I stood aside, staring at him. Once, I loved him with all my heart, but now all I felt was pure disgust.

The moment the door opened, Margaret threw herself into his arms.

She wore a silk slip dress, her hair cascading in soft waves, looking every bit like a delicate doll.

""Liam."" She tilted her face up, her eyes shimmering with tears. ""Today must have been hard for you, right?""

Liam instantly went all weak and tired-looking. ""Mmm, at least I have you,"" he murmured before lowering his lips to hers.

I turned away sharply. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't block out the wet, intimate sounds of their kissing.

My gut twisted with a nausea that shouldn't even exist anymore. I floated to the bedroom to escape, but what I saw there just made my heart ache even more.

All my belongings were gone.

My skincare on the vanity, my favorite aromatherapy diffuser by the bed, and all my clothes in the wardrobe—every last trace of me had been wiped clean.

Instead, there were Margaret's dresses and designer handbags.

Among the paired toothbrushes and towels in the bathroom, none was mine.

Liam embraced Margaret from behind, his chin resting on her shoulder. ""You did a great job cleaning,"" he murmured.

""The cleaning service came today,"" Margaret said softly. ""I had all her belongings packed up and sent to her parents' place. You don't mind, do you?""

""Of course not. You did the right thing."" Liam brushed a kiss against her earlobe and added, ""Keeping her stuff around would only make it harder to move on.""

I floated right in their faces, glaring at Liam down. ""You're lying!"" I shrieked. ""You called the cleaning service yesterday, before my body was even cold!""

Of course, he couldn't hear me.

""Liam."" Margaret nestled against Liam's chest. ""Sometimes, I get scared thinking—what if you hadn't made her get out of the car that day because of me?""

""Shh."" Liam pressed a finger to her lips. ""This isn't your fault. Blame the truck driver, or maybe Chloe just wasn't careful enough.""

He cupped her face in his hands, whispering, ""We deserve happiness, Margie.""

I froze in mid-air.

They just brushed off my death like it was nothing? Just started a brand new life together, without a shred of guilt?

Rage poured through me.

I focused all my energy and charged at the glass on the coffee table—it didn't budge.

But Margaret suddenly screamed, her fingers digging into Liam's arm.

""What's wrong?"" Liam's eyes swept the room, instantly alert.

""J-Just now, it felt like someone sighed right in my ear."" Margaret's face went deathly pale.

Liam let out a sigh of relief and chuckled, rubbing her cheek. ""You're imagining things, darling. We're alone.""

I froze.

Margaret heard me?

With every ounce of my strength, I screamed at her, ""Get the hell out of my home!""

Margaret shivered violently. ""Liam, I'm freezing all of a sudden.""

Liam tightened his embrace. ""Maybe the air conditioning's just too cold."" He grabbed the remote and turned up the temperature. ""Don't overthink things, hmm?""

For days, I drifted through the apartment like a ghost struck in a loop, haunting the spaces that brimmed with memories.

I watched them having sex in my bed, cooking together in my kitchen, and watching the sunset on my balcony. Each scene tore me apart from inside.

I had tried every trick I could think of to get their attention.

I tried to make noise while they were being intimate, to create distractions while Margaret was looking in the mirror, and even to scream in their ears while they were asleep. But nothing worked.

The only time I succeeded was when I made the curtains sway slightly, but Liam dismissed it as ""the window not being shut right.""

On the evening of the seventh day, I hovered outside the balcony, watching the setting sun stain the clouds blood-red.

Liam and Margaret were discussing their wedding plans in the living room. They wanted to tie the knot within three months after my death. They said fate always changed, and they should seize the moment.

1lwxo8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1lwxo8m/27m_scienceloving_chemist_looking_for_meaningful/,27M | Science-loving chemist looking for meaningful connections,"Hi there! I’m Orhun, 27 years old, a chemist by profession and a curious soul by nature. While I spend my days working with reactions and formulas, what I truly enjoy is connecting with people on a deeper level — sharing thoughts, laughs, and meaningful conversations.

I’m someone who values empathy, honesty, and emotional maturity. I love cozy movie nights, long walks (preferably with coffee), learning random science facts, and diving into thought-provoking chats about life, philosophy, or just silly everyday things.

I’m here not for dating, but to find genuine, lasting friendships. If you’re someone who feels a bit out of place or lonely sometimes and is looking for a real connection, I’d be happy to get to know you. Let’s talk — about everything or nothing, whatever feels right.

Feel free to send a message. Who knows? Maybe this small post will be the beginning of a great connection.
