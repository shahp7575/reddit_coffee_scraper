My shin hit the coffee table

and I can still feel the pain pressed fresh against my skin.

Games of suspense and surprise

are thought to be child's play.

Bruises fade but my flesh holds memories

of the wear and tear of my youth.

\_

The routine of my girlhood

was a merry-go-round of misery.

There seemed no way off

the tradition of the only temperament we knew.

\_

I leapt off the route

of my preconceived futurity.

Feet first and reconsideration second,

I left my stomach on the ledge.

\_

I arrived to womanhood

bursting with vast, barren scapes.

I had no idea how to fill these years

with the joy I yearned.

From flint to fire he ignited my heart

when I had stopped hunting the happiness.

He seeps into the crevasses within me

and seamlessly makes me whole.

I find fulfillment within my purpose

that I stumbled on among my ruins.

My future holds promise

and love radiates bright.

you just need to turn on the lights.

I'm David, and I've been working as a writing professor for the past six years here in California. I started pretty early, which was a wild ride--and it still is--but it truly is the best job in the world. Other things I enjoy doing are reading, writing, listening to music, playing music, playing volleyball, working out, drinking coffee, watching a movie, playing video games, traveling, cooking, learning something new, or a mix of any of those.

I absolutely love good stories regardless of where they're found, which expands to enjoying meeting and talking to people. When I'm not teaching, I'm talking to students before and after class (often risking being late to my next class!) or meeting with students both current and former and talking about writing, life, and everything in between. It's a lot for an introvert like me, but I'm awful at saying no, and it is one of the aspects I enjoy most about the job.

That's enough about me. I'm trying to keep this shorter than my usual posts, which apparently is a struggle for me. I want to know about you! There's something to be appreciated about the raw honesty and vulnerability of meeting strangers online, so come say hi!

1hp4h1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hp4h1k/can_athome_teeth_whitening_actually_work/,Can At-Home Teeth Whitening Actually Work?,"If you‚Äôve been scrolling through Reddit or other forums looking for teeth whitening advice, you‚Äôve probably seen mixed reviews on at-home whitening kits. Some claim they‚Äôre amazing, while others say they‚Äôre a waste of time and money. I decided to test one of these kits for myself to find out if it‚Äôs worth the hype. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about at-home teeth whitening based on my experience.

# Why Choose At-Home Whitening?

Professional teeth whitening is the gold standard, but it‚Äôs expensive‚Äîoften costing $500 or more. Add in the risk of sensitivity, and it‚Äôs not always an appealing option. At-home kits offer a more affordable and convenient alternative, but the big question is whether they can deliver the same results.

The kit I chose claimed to whiten teeth by up to 7 shades in just six days. It also promised minimal sensitivity, which was a major selling point for me. I‚Äôll break down how it worked, the results I got, and whether it‚Äôs a good option for you.

# How At-Home Whitening Works

Most at-home whitening kits use either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to break down stains on your teeth. The kit I tried came with:

* A **dentist-formulated whitening gel**, designed to target both surface and deep stains.
* An **LED mouthpiece** to activate the gel and enhance its effectiveness.
* Simple instructions that made the process straightforward and easy.

The combination of professional-grade ingredients and LED technology is what sets these kits apart from standard strips or toothpaste.

# My Day-by-Day Results

Here‚Äôs how my experience unfolded over the six-day whitening cycle:

* **Day 1**: The first session was quick‚Äîjust 10 minutes. While I didn‚Äôt notice any immediate changes, my teeth felt cleaner after using the gel.
* **Day 3**: By the third day, I started seeing subtle improvements. The yellowish tint from coffee and tea stains was fading, and my teeth looked slightly brighter.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, the results were undeniable. My teeth were visibly whiter‚Äîaround 6‚Äì7 shades lighter. Best of all, the whitening looked natural, not artificial or overly bright.

One thing that really stood out was the lack of sensitivity. I‚Äôve tried whitening strips in the past, and they left my teeth feeling zapped every time I drank something cold. This kit caused no discomfort at all, which was a huge relief.

# Why This Kit Stands Out

Here are a few reasons why this kit worked so well for me:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel wasn‚Äôt just strong; it was also gentle, which is a rare combination.
2. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece helped activate the gel, speeding up the whitening process and ensuring even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Gel**: Unlike many products that degrade over time, this gel was stored in a temperature-controlled environment, so it arrived fresh and effective.

# Common Concerns About At-Home Whitening

I‚Äôve read plenty of threads about at-home whitening, and some concerns come up again and again. Here‚Äôs what I found in my experience:

* **Will it harm your enamel?** Not if you use it as directed. The gel is formulated to be safe for enamel, so there‚Äôs no risk of damage.
* **Does it work on deep stains?** Yes! This kit worked on both surface stains (coffee, tea) and deeper discoloration.
* **How long do results last?** It depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and maintaining good oral hygiene can keep your teeth bright for months.

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Options?

Here‚Äôs how this kit stacks up against other methods I‚Äôve tried:

1. **Whitening Strips**: These are affordable but can cause uneven whitening and sensitivity.
2. **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive and often painful.
3. **Toothpaste**: Great for maintenance but not strong enough to make a noticeable difference.

This kit offered the perfect balance: affordable, effective, and gentle.

# Tips for the Best Results

If you‚Äôre considering an at-home whitening kit, here are some tips to maximize your results:

1. **Stick to the Routine**: Use the kit consistently for the recommended number of days.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Minimize coffee, tea, and wine consumption during the whitening process.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly to keep stains at bay.

# Final Verdict

So, can an at-home whitening kit really work? Based on my experience, the answer is yes‚Äîif you choose the right one. This kit delivered on its promises, leaving my teeth significantly whiter in just six days. It‚Äôs a great alternative to expensive professional treatments, especially if you‚Äôre looking for something gentle and convenient.

1hp4gys,https://www.reddit.com/r/blendedfamilies/comments/1hp4gys/dating_a_dad_of_two_kids_why_did_things_get_so/,"Dating a dad of two kids, why did things get so complicated? Am I a bandaid? ","So thing is, when I met him at the gym and had a little spark between us, I was sure this handsome dude in his 30s is for sure already locked down with a wife and kids. Well, he does have kids, two in fact with a huge age gap.

First is fourteen, and second is four. Mom of first is a drug addict, hasn't been in the picture for a long time. Second child is with his ex-fianc√©, who currently still lives in their shared home with him. Breakup happened 6 months ago, and we've been dating for 4 months. 

Everything started great. We began flirting at the gym, had lots of fun laughing and sharing our common interests. He was open about having kids, I was very open to dating a guy who had kids since we're both in our 30's and more and more people around me already have their own. He was also upfront about still living with his ex, since they had bought a home together and selling it was a slow process. Seemed to be over the relationship with her and in general excited to be out of it, especially because she hinted at her being very bossy and demeaning to him. And he wasn't kidding. Every time his phone rang he seemed to tense up, and become small and docile, which was a complete opposite of what he had been just a moment before. 

I decided that I'd keep things a little cool between us until he would be fully moved out, but what do you expect from a single gal that's high on pheromones at the gym? One weekend when his kids and ex were apparently away, we went drinking to a local bar and had an absolute blast, singing karaoke and laughing over anything and everything. While we were waiting for the taxis home, I dropped the ball and kissed him. Hence forth things began to escalate. 

Not soon after, I suggested we get coffee at my place after the gym. He was slightly hesitant, because he told me he had to be home soonishly, but he eventually agreed to come over for a bit. While we were talking and cuddling, his ex called, he picked up immediately and then proceeded to lie about his whereabouts. Which I felt extremely odd about, considering he told me they had already broken up. I guess he noticed the surprise on my face, and proceeded to just say he didn't want to have ""that convo"" on the phone. Whatever that meant. 

In a few weeks time, it became a routine thay 2-3 times a week he'd pop by after gym for a coffee. And every time she'd call about something menial, he'd lie about his whereabouts. I began to feel really bad, especially because I was so excited about him and had told all my friends and family about what a wonderful man I had met, but he had kept on keeping me a secret from everyone, especially his ex. I felt like a mistress, even though we were not cheating on anyone. I ended up pushing him about it once, and he shared that when they broke up, she had requested him to not get into anything until they would be fully separated. He had agreed to those terms, but told me that meeting me was so unexpected and fast, and that he really couldn't handle her freaking out on him especially since they'd still be figuring out co-parenting dynamics in the future when he has his own place. 

I told him I understood, logically I did - but as it kept on happening I somehow began to feel like a mistress of a married family man. Also, the rare few times we were out for food or coffee, he'd sit us as far away from the streetside windows as possible, presumably to avoid anyone his ex knows from seeing us. 

A detail I also found strange was that when he mentioned that his toddler had climbed into their bed in the night after having nightmares, I asked why he would still be sharing a bed with his ex - and he replied that because he's so tall (he really is a tower), he couldn't fit onto the sofa and therefore just accepted that this was the living situation until he got his own flat for himself and the teenager. I thought somehow it was valid of him to say especially because he works a physically demanding job in construction, but was somehow so puzzled why his ex wouldn't have opted for the sofa especially since she'd been the one to initiate the breakup. On one occasion we also talked about cheating, and he was very clear about it being a one and done type thing for him, so I somehow thought that with this attitude they would not be intimate, and I never got that feeling. Still, strange. 

And as you'd expect, things between us kept escalating. One very cuddly evening when we'd both skipped gym to spend time together I caved in, and had sex with him - something I was pushing not to do until he'd have his own place.

I guess it was because 2,5 months in he'd been so open about his feelings, and told me he loved me. Then onwards I felt like my feelings also began flooding in despite my hesitation especially to consider him being a parent and wanting to get to know him properly. Oxytocin definitely deepend that bond. 

I think there was a point where he just began to feel more guilt than love, and after he'd found a new flat for them (him and his teenager to live in), he got really distant with me. It's like his while world was falling apart. Every time we'd meet up he was so tuned out, absent and constantly thinking about how he'd yet again become a single parent. Which to me felt really tone-deaf since he never included me into his picture. Or he would, in some clutch save when he'd mention right after how he couldn't wait to live together with me. It's like our whole dating period was just skipped to this weird affair, and instead of thinking about how much freedom he could have finally spending time together with me, he was only focused on the loss of his ""family"", when the breakup itself had happened at that point already half a year ago. He did mention at one point to me that they had great family routines and ways to deal with things that he will miss, and that he didn't realize it would hit him so hard. I just really don't understand why those things didn't hit him earlier? Why only after he was seriously moving out of their shared home? 

I felt like I was never supposed to be in this position. Watching a man I love have to grieve losing his family? It became especially hurtful to me because this was never an affair. He made the feelings of his seemingly-terrible ex fiance more important than mine, only because they share a child together. The secrecy made me feel like he was never proud to be with me, or that he doesn't appreciate me. Even when he told me those nice things unprompted in the beginning. As this continued, my feelings began to faulter and dissipate. 

I told him eventually about how I was feeling, and especially about me feeling left out, since even though we saw eachother for a few hours 2-3 times a week, I never dared to text or call him out of fear of him getting into trouble. He expressed regret about the whole thing, and told me he was sorry that it went this way, and that he wishes he could be the best man for me and that at the moment he wasn't capable. I felt like there was no conclusion to that conversation. We simply began to meet less often, my feelings became more tense and anxious around him - I felt like he'd just put me on a shelf until x period when he'd be fully ""ready"" to date me. Even the lack of communicating with me properly about how he was feeling and what was going on in his mind and heart somehow just made me feel so resentful towards him. I even began to wonder if the reason his ex was like that to him was because of his inability to be direct and communicative. He just seemed in general to be so aloof but simultaneously like such a ball of stress that would shut down at the first sign of difficulty. It's like he couldn't handle stress at all, which could have to do with raising a child to 9 years old completely on his own. But still. Why drag me on like this? Why haven't my feelings been important to him at all? 

I can almost feel how his feelings shifted away, and I feel like the man I know he could be isn't who he is at this moment. He's moving out of his flat in two months, and even then, figuring out the new co-parenting with an ex who seems controlling and demeaning probably isn't the best situation to be dating in. 

But I do really care for him, deeply even. I'm just so insanely confused how a man who told me he loves me could not wish to spend every waking moment with me, texting nonstop and getting to know everything about me? At least until the honeymoon period wears off? Is it because he has children that the shift in responsibilities makes him less emotionally available? Is it because he may not be as over his ex or their shared dynamic? Please help me understand if my expectations of him are completely unrealistic, as I have zero idea about parenting responsibilities. I'm feeling just so lost and confused. 


TL;DR:

Man I've been dating for 4 months has kept me a secret from his ex-fianc√© because he promised he wouldn't move on until they fully separated. They still share a house and have two children in the mix. Even though she initiated the breakup well over 6 months ago, he's been hiding me out of courtesy to her for four months now. I feel like I've completely missed out on a blossoming honeymoon phase and I'm left on emotional standby until he is ready to date me (which has no clear date at the moment). I feel like I was lead to believe he was more over the relationship until he'd found a new apartment, and is now somehow grieving the loss of his family while I'm left not being emotionally cared for at all between his parental duties and delegating the separation. He told me he loved me but I feel more like I'm a convenience for his future instead of actually being invested in getting to know me and loving on me consistently. Help me understand this whole situation and if my expectations are completely unrealistic considering his situation? ",1,1735502704.0,blendedfamilies,0,1.0,False

Not too fussy which; I'm a secret fan of targas, but the coupe is one of the prettiest cars I've ever seen. Heretically, I'm not too fussed over manual vs tip - I'm after a 'driving' car rather than something to take out for coffee.

That said, I currently own and weekly commute in a very well sorted 996.2 C2. Rare colour, (although not too desirable), manual box, relatively low mileage, GREAT condition, all work sorted - full suspension rebuild, manifolds, lovely exhaust, AOS, IMS etc, no bore score issues, full grey leather that is in great condition. I know it's JUST a 996, and a standard C2 manual at that, but it's a good one.

On the flip side, within my price range, there are a fair few 993 targas or tip coupes, mileage ok (80-120k), greys / silver or some blues over black, ok options. 

Usage will be commuting 100 miles weekly, not a garage queen. The head says keep the 996... it's a known quantity, objectively a good car, in great condition. The heart wants a 993.... because it's the 911 I've always wanted, but is this a case of not meeting your heroes?

1hp4dfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1hp4dfv/coming_off_meds_on_carnivore/,Coming off meds on carnivore,"26F- hi everyone, writing this at 3am as sleep has evaded me so far tonight :(( Run down of my day- quiet Sunday, not sticking with my usual exercise and other routines as we have family staying for Christmas so I'm not really using up my physical and mental energy. For food, I had scrambled eggs with cream cheese and salmon for brekkie, an almond chai (I'm working on phasing these out), two steaks for lunch, and two steaks plus two eggs for dinner. I also did some Wim Hof breathing before bed in the hope that it would calm me down, but subsequent research has suggested that this can cause insomnia in some people? Does anyone see anything in what I did today that could've rendered me sleepless? 

I started carnivore in October 2024 after a very difficult year with my mental health and sleep (2x hospitalisations, lots of medication etc etc). A doctor friend of mine who has been carnivore for ages suggested that I try it and I was like yep why not I have nothing to lose at this point. So I started it, I didn't get any of the initial dramatic improvements that some people experience but I think that's because my diet was already quite low in sugar, dairy, alcohol and caffeine. As I went on, I started to feel more grounded and emotionally stable, so much so that I decided to wean myself off my meds- I don't really vibe with taking meds long term because I'm quite sensitive and I didn't like how foggy, numb and forgetful they made me feel. 

I'm glad that I did this and I don't want to go back on them, but since completely stopping all of my medication two weeks ago, I've noticed a real decline in my mood and a return of my insomnia which I think is a natural response to adjusting to not being on meds anymore. I also think that I've made things worse for myself as I've eaten some non-carnivore foods over Christmas (mainly chocolate and dairy) which have triggered my anxiety, depression, insomnia and sugar cravings and probably made the side effects of coming off meds worse. I think that I'm particularly sensitive to substances like sugar, dairy, caffeine and alcohol but still occasionally have them, forgetting what they do to me until I'm lying in bed wide awake at 3am :')) It's so frustrating to me that my bf can have six cups of coffee a day and can sleep like a baby but the caffeine in chocolate is enough to stop me sleeping...

Are there any other sensitive carnivores here? Has anyone else navigated coming off mental health meds on carnivore? Did you get any symptoms back again? Did you do anything specific which improved these symptoms and got you on track again? What do I need to do to function optimally? 

My sleep deprived mind is telling me that carnivore is just another thing that works for other people but not for me, and that things will never get better and I'm going to be stuck feeling shit forever. Would greatly appreciate any tips, advice or words of wisdom. ",1,1735502456.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I'll totally understand if this gets removed by the mods. Lately some people had been saying Chris Bledsoe ""ufo of god"" was tied to some government and legit work. When I heard about ""the lady"" - I got interested due to all that interesting bullshit the Templar theories spout about the lady, and the ""ufo"" phenomenon. 

My gut leans towards it not being legit, (power read the book two days ago) mainly due to some things that I would see as logically inconsistent and also a ""ghost hunt"" he added that served no purpose unless aliens want to explain it to me over coffee, in person... but basically he says at one point when he gets visited by ""small humanoids with big eyes and a triangle
On their chest"" - they gave him a prickly creature thing. 

I want to remind everyone the multiple claims in his book about just being an available witness to the world... he is making a low key claim to be a prophet. He doesn't say prophet but he says he is being used to spread a message... 

So where is the physical icon he was given and put in a dog crate? He said it looked like a headless, leg less chihuahua with spikes coming out of it. 

I'm gonna add, that's the second object that had a bunch of spikes coming out of it when he's describing his experiences. 

For Gideon, for Thomas, and all the other doubters out there, who are rightly justified in a dedication to truth. - where is that thing he was given? And does he post pictures of his orbs all the time? 

I'm asking here as a way to clear two of the most questionable moments of his accounts.

Ghosts and the icon. Why ghosts? Just why... and then an icon of humanity he put in his dog crate? Can I see some evidence pretty please

I want to believe, because I want the universe to be awesome and colorful. I just am not sure this was the ticket.

Flaring continues. CMEs on the way, possibly significant, albeit not major. The flaring has shifted to a slightly longer duration overall and eruptivity has increased. The coronagraph signatures are fairly modest but the modeling is quite robust and geoeffective. I will be producing a full update this evening when all the information and events of the day are factored. HUXt is still missing a CME, CME scorecard is not updated all the way, and there are ongoing events making this the prudent move to do a final forecast later. Right now, the current estimates are Kp6-Kp8 and there is reason to possibly expect a higher end result despite fairly faint signatures owing to the incoming train of CMEs forming. This is a dynamic we have seen before. I still regard this as Active Conditions Lite when compared to May or other episodes but the chances for a big event are certainly rising. I recently went back and watched the coronagraphs and SDO imagery for that event and I can tell you definitively the two are not the same. Nevertheless, we may get a rare significant NYE geomagnetic storm according to the current modeling. We moving into geomagnetic storm watch footing.  Let's get to what I have for right now.

SUMMARY

I see no reason to argue as all the models are currently in pretty good agreement that a significant CME sequence is headed our way with arrivals on late 12/31 to early 1/1 currently. This will be better constrained as more model entries are submitted. It should be noted that these figures do not include the last few hours and there does appear to have been more eruptive activity. These  events will be evaluated as information comes available and factored into the final forecast. The given range is currently Kp6-Kp8 and while the individual CMEs are fairly faint, there are several of them, including the X1 powered event. I can easily see us hitting the higher end owing to the multiple impacts and the chance for interaction in the solar wind or consecutive arrivals which could produce either a stronger shorter event or more likely a longer more prolonged one. The velocities are modest and the signatures a little light so keep that in mind. The real zinger would be if the sun produces a big fast CME like the October event in the coming hours that can gobble them up. Keep that possibility in mind as you watch the day unfold. The light density may be a result of a magnetic cloud type CME with a low beta indicating it is driven by the embedded magnetic field more than anything but this is not confirmed. Another possibility is that the aim is very good and the CME is a bit narrow and mostly obscured by the occultation disk. At the same time, NOAA is going with 30-50 p/cm3 and NASA is not far behind so evidently they think so. The CMEs appear to have a good orientation and are not modeled to go N or S of us or in other words over or under us. I have not included HUXt yet because it needs to update but the first modeled CME has a 95% confidence to hit. 

We are cookin with gas now! Stay tuned for more updates as they become available. A strong NYE storm is likely on the way but always remember what happens in the solar wind stays in the solar wind and results may vary. Doesn't it feel good to be BACK!

The tuning machines were nearly frozen so I took them off, soaked them in naphtha and worked them a bit to get some of the gunk out, then lubricated the thoroughly with Tri-Flow Lubricant. Off the guitar, they loosened up ALOT - I was able to continuously turn them with mostly no resistance (a few still had a tight spot). When I reinstalled them and restrung the guitar (Martin SP .011), as I tightened the strings the tuners got harder and harder to turn. I think these tuning machines may be original (they're Gibson Deluxe / Klusons), and I'm wondering if the tension pulling the post towards the guitar body has just worn the tuners out, or whether there might be something else going on.

I don't have a ton of experience working on guitars (or anything to measure string height), but I get no buzzing when playing, and to my eye the neck looks straight (I know, you can't really tell by eye but that's what I've got). Am I just looking at buying new tuners or is there something else I need to be looking at? Thanks in advance --

1hp49jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLetterH/comments/1hp49jk/the_most_dangerous_letter/,The most dangerous letter,"### **The Shape That Haunts: A Tale of the Letter H**

In the small, insular town of Hallowfield, everything seemed normal at first glance. But there was one peculiar trait about the place‚Äîan obsessive reverence for the letter *H*. The street names, the businesses, even the local school all started with *H*. No one seemed to question it; it was simply the way things had always been.

But for Hazel, an outsider who had recently moved to Hallowfield, the *H* obsession became unsettling. The town's motto, carved into the stone archway at its entrance, read: **""Honor the H, or the H will honor you.""** 

At first, Hazel dismissed it as harmless eccentricity. But strange things started to happen. 

---

### **The Letter Appears**
One morning, Hazel woke to find a perfectly drawn *H* etched into her bathroom mirror, the condensation from her shower framing it. She swore she hadn‚Äôt done it, and the sharp, angular lines seemed too precise to be accidental. That night, she noticed an *H* scratched into the wood of her bedside table, deep and deliberate.

She tried to dismiss it as a prank, perhaps from her overly friendly neighbors, Henry and Harriet. But the *H* started appearing everywhere: in the foam of her coffee, in the pattern of cracks on the sidewalk, even in the way shadows fell across her living room walls.

---

### **The Whispering H**
Then came the whispers. At night, just as Hazel was about to drift off, she heard it: a soft, breathy sound, almost imperceptible but undeniably there. 

‚ÄúHhhh...‚Äù

It was not quite a word, just the sound of air escaping. It grew louder each night, until it felt as though it was being whispered directly into her ear. She began to dread the nights, her anxiety mounting as the sound clawed at her sanity.

---

### **The Shape Takes Form**
Desperate for answers, Hazel visited the town's library, which was housed in a building shaped like a giant *H*. Inside, she found a dusty old book titled *The Harbinger of H*. The librarian, an elderly woman with trembling hands, looked at her with wide, terrified eyes as she handed it over.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt read it alone,‚Äù the librarian warned, her voice barely above a whisper.

Hazel ignored the advice and devoured the book that night. It was a chilling account of an ancient entity known as ""The H,"" a shape-shifting force that preyed on obsession. The entity‚Äôs power grew as people fixated on it, drawing them deeper into madness until they became its puppets. 

The final chapter was missing, torn out violently.

---

### **The Town's Secret**
The next day, Hazel confronted Henry and Harriet, who were surprisingly evasive. Their cheery facade cracked, and Harriet whispered, ""The H chooses its own. You can't fight it. You have to honor it.""

Hazel demanded to know what that meant, but Henry slammed the door in her face.

That night, the *H* returned in her dreams. It loomed over her, its rigid form twisting and bending like a living thing. It whispered promises of power, immortality, and freedom from fear‚Äîif only she would submit.

When she woke, her hands were stained with ink, the letter *H* scrawled all over her bedroom walls.

---

### **Becoming the H**
Hazel decided to flee Hallowfield, but the town wouldn‚Äôt let her go. The roads looped endlessly, bringing her back to the stone archway with its ominous motto. The whispers grew louder, and the *H* began appearing not just in objects, but in people‚ÄîHenry‚Äôs body twisted unnaturally into its shape, and Harriet‚Äôs shadow stretched into its angular form.

One night, Hazel stood before her mirror, clutching a knife. The whispers were deafening now, a cacophony of ""Hhh"" that drowned out her thoughts. 

In the reflection, she saw it: her own body contorting, her spine arching, her arms bending until she became the perfect shape of the letter *H*.

---

### **The Aftermath**
Hazel was never seen again. Her house stood empty, but the *H* remained. Travelers who passed through Hallowfield claimed to hear whispers in the wind, see the letter etched into the ground, and feel an inexplicable urge to stay.

In the center of town, a new carving appeared on the archway: **""Hazel honors the H now.""**

No one knew who carved it, but everyone in Hallowfield nodded in quiet acceptance. After all, the *H* always claimed what it was owed.",1,1735502175.0,TheLetterH,5,1.0,False

1hp48jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1hp48jv/my_entire_tonsillectomy_experience_and_recovery/,My Entire Tonsillectomy Experience and Recovery- Long Post ,"
Hello everyone! I have recently recovered from having my tonsils removed on 12/17/24. I am 23F and wanted to share with you my experience because this Reddit has been a blessing for me (and also gave me more anxiety at times but it‚Äôs fineee) this post is very long and I apologize in advance. I know I enjoyed reading someone‚Äôs entire experience top to bottom. It was calming at times so wanted to pay it forward. **I am not a medical professional by any means, pls talk to ur doctor about things, this is more of a diary of my experience**

**Why I got them removed:** I had tonsillitis like 3 times in the last six months. I had giant tonsils, could not swallow or breathe properly. I was worried something was really wrong with them because one was larger than the other and they had a lump on them (pathology ended up being fine yay!) They were considered a grade three size. I asked my primary care about them she sent in an antibiotic and dismissed it, I went in for a routine dental cleaning a few weeks later and the hygienist was like bro are you okay you need to go to an ENT, so I did and as soon as I sat down he said ‚Äúthose puppy‚Äôs gotta go. Merry Christmas‚Äù. I debated waiting until next year ( I am starting my first big girl job, getting married, and moving to a new state so no time for shit to go wrong) but I am so glad I did it now because I had family around to take care of me. (advice #1 make sure you have someone to help nurse you the first few days) 

**Surgery Prep-**
The week before surgery I couldn‚Äôt have any alcohol, ibuprofen and anything else that was a blood thinner.Night before, I started fasting lat 6pm (last meal was some amazing sushi) and started water fasting at 10pm.  They asked me to stop eating at midnight and make sure I have Gatorade as my last drink. The night before I had to shower with antibacterial soap (including my hair) and not put on any moisturizer or anything after not even deodorant ( I hated this part). I knew I was going to feel like shit the next couple days so I used this as a last opportunity to give my hair a blowout. (I think it was a mental thing that really helped me on days 2-3 when I was in so much pain) Fun note: plan out out some comfy pjs for when you get home from the hospital and the first few days after the surgery because you will live in them. I wore some Christmas ones lol. 

**Surgery Day-**
**Pre-surgery:**
I got to the hospital at 6:00am and apparently was supposed to be there at 5:30am. I was never told this and was told my arrival time was 6:30am. So I was freaking out because I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to even have the surgery or to give my dad a hug before going back. (Important note; this is the first surgery I‚Äôve ever had so I was very very nervous). 
They let my family come back to the room after I changed quickly into hospital attire and took all my vitals. At this point make sure to pee so you don‚Äôt pee yourself when they knock you out! I was given an IV in my hand where they start administering fluids. I was also given Tylenol prior to surgery to help with pain from the breathing tube after surgery.  Now I met about 10 different people involved in the surgery; nurses, anesthesiologists, etc. I signed consent forms and then my surgeon comes in (who was my ENT doc from the start) and he talked to me which was very sweet and answered my questions. After talking to him and consenting to everything I was given something to calm my nerves and was taken back. Right before I went back some rude ass nurse told me it would take me a month the heal (I legit only had 17 days to heal before my wedding- so this sparked my anxiety because my doctor had told me different) I get into the Operating Room and they have me scoot onto the table . This is when the swarm of people start, nurses and anesthesiologists were prepping me with making sure my body was in the right place and explaining to me what they were doing. They put heat wraps around my feet and covered me with a blanket to keep my comfortable. I heard them greet my surgeon as he came in but I didn‚Äôt even see him (I had my glasses off and ya girl is blind af). They told me to take deep breathes to get in extra oxygen and I remember telling them how much i appreciated their kindness and then it was lights out. Note: during this entire process the hospital was sending my fianc√© text updates of where I was and what was happening. My entire surgery took 9 minutes. The pre and post care took the longest. 

**Post-Surgery**: This part felt like a movie. I remember hazily waking up in the recovery area. Heard my surgeon tell me I did a great job and he wanted to make sure I woke up okay so he followed me to recovery and then he ran off. It was me and the nurse. She was so sweet. Not to be dramatic but waking up was horrible. I couldn‚Äôt talk, I was in a shit ton of pain, and scared from the breathing tube. I started sobbing like a child involuntarily. It was a lot of pressure for me to get this surgery and I think it hit me at once and the nurses told me that sometimes the bodies trauma response to a breathing tube & anesthesia is to cry. The nurse helped me through it and gave me several rounds of pain meds to take the edge off. I also started sipping water. After I was okay I was wheeled back to my original room to find my fianc√© waiting for me. At this point my IV was removed and I was allowed to put my clothes normal back on. I changed and stood up and I almost puked (I‚Äôve had baby anesthesia at the dentist before so I knew there was a potential I‚Äôd get queasy). The nurse saw my face go white and immediately gave me something for nausea. I was given a popsicle, ice water in a take home jug, and wheeled to the car. Overall I had a really good experience at the hospital and deeply respect those in healthcare!!! 

**Recovery**
Remainder of surgery day (day one) - I was home by 11am. I immediately came home and slept from the remaining meds in my system. I started taking some good pain meds a few hours after I was home. Drinking water was painful, I had an airplane pillow that I kept around my neck to help me sleep upright, and I also could slide ice packs and strap secure into it which helped with swelling a ton. I used a humidifier next to my bed through the entire experience. Moving your head at all is extremely painful the first few days from them moving your head around in the OR my neck was slightly sore. My fianc√© said I was very out of it this day. I tried eating non dairy ice cream and it was too thick so all I could get down was a little apple sauce. I could breathe out my nose better than I ever have before immediately tho! 

*Day 2-* This day my mom stayed at my place with me to make sure I was okay. I stayed in bed a lot this day and kept ice on my face and made sure to take my meds. I actually managed to take a shower this day (minus washing my hair as you don‚Äôt wanna be throwing ur head back to wash ur hair). I was able to eat a few spoonfuls of mashed potatoes with a good bit of bone broth so they were super soupy. I drank ice water every single chance I could because hydration = quicker healing. Talking was painful so I used a text to speech on my phone to communicate with my fianc√© ü§£. 

*Day 3 & 4‚Äì Pain ranged on this day from a 5-8/10.* People saying this is a walk in the park are tweaking. When my pain would hit an 8/10 I got permission from my doctor to up my dosage of meds a little. I was home alone these days so they really ran together. Just more of the same from the previous day. Meds, ice water, soupy mashed potatoes and broth, watch Tv with ice packs on my face, nap, repeat. (Advice from these days: when you wake up and your throat is on fire #1 take ur meds and eat a popsicle and in between every bite/ lick drink some ice water!!!) Popsicle Recommendation: Cotton Candy Jonny Pops - no citrus flavor and made of filtered water. 
Tmi but I was not able to go to the bathroom until day 4.

*Day 5-* I was still in pain but tried over cooked Mac and cheese. I was able to stomach some after blending it up with some broth (you get real creative when ur hungry). Tried an iced coffee this day and it made me feel funny so that was a no go. Chocolate milk and pudding became edible, along with avocado packets with salt! I tried potato soup. It was so amazing and it had bacon bits that hurt to swallow and I couldn‚Äôt eat it- it was like a sick tease. I could feel my ears popping as I would try and speak. I sent the following text to my mom that I think describes day 5 perfectly: ‚ÄúFirst time eating real food and wearing a bra and my engagement ring all week‚Äù. This day I started taking a pill steroid because before hand no way in hell I was swallowing them prior. 


*Day 6- Doctor Follow Up.* This was the first day I went back out in public. I had my follow up with my ENT and I was healing nicely. I swear drinking so much water saved me as other redditors have mentioned. I was able to run to Walmart with my fianc√© this day but after all the running around and talking I was hurting pretty bad at the end of the day but icing helped. The jaw pain, ear pain, and tongue pain were just as bad if not worse than the throat pain where the tonsils were removed but my doctor told me all the nerves are connected so it makes sense. 

*Day 7- Christmas Eve*. I just rested this day until my parents came over and tried to throw a little Christmas celebration for me. I was so beat up because laughing hurt, swallowing hurt, I couldn‚Äôt eat the food, and I didn‚Äôt feel like myself. I ended up crying a little but having my families in person support made it easier. This is the point I think I was over being on meds and not eating much. At this point I was finally able to open my mouth to look at my throat and wow! It was all white and healing. I ended up calling my doctor this day because I had a  dime sized dark red/black blood clot spot on where my right tonsil was (I thought I was starting to hemorrhage). My doctor said ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt spitting up blood you‚Äôre fine just chew ice chips and drink ice water‚Äù. So let that be some relief for those of you reading this that are stupid anxious like myself ‚ù§Ô∏è. It was the scabs peeling off early and bleeding a little but my body was able to stop it. After this scare I played it safe and only ate soupy things and went heavy on the ice water. It went away in two days. I set alarms for every 2-3 hours for meds and water throughout the night- it sucked but was a key part of my recovery. 
I saw someone mention that while the recovery is painful, it‚Äôs manageable, it‚Äôs the longevity of it that breaks you down. 

*Day 8 - Christmas*
I spent this day in bed. Hydrating and resting. Watching YouTube (anyone a Kevin langue fan lol) 
Foods of the day: Chicken Ramen with bone broth with honey and boiled egg and soy sauce was good. Avocado Dairy Free Deep chocolate ice cream iS AMAZING. I did a heating pad on my upper back to help relax my neck and shoulders and it helped a ton with the humidifier and ice on my neck. 
My pain this day was a 6/10- only because the pain under my freaking tongue!! This is not talked about enough but when they knock you out the breathing tube and the utensils they use can scrape your mouth up and swallowing ice water on this day literally left me shaking from one specific spot that looked like a canker sore. I began wondering if I had an infection but I knew I had to power through with the ice water. It went away on day 10. 

*Day 9- I did not sleep worth a damn this night.* I think my scabs were falling off and it was just raw and painful. I took a nap later in the day but this was just more resting. I tried grits this day and the grainy feeling in my throat was a no go. Sometimes it feels like ur choking but it‚Äôs just all the swelling. 

*Day 10- this day I went six hours with no meds!* And I stopped taking the heavy pain meds and just switched to ibuprofen and Tylenol. I rode around for some errands with my fianc√© this day and was able to try a bite of his cheeseburger (a happy tear was shed). Waking up from a nap or in general is still annoying but it feels like a bad strep throat that once I drank water & ate a popsicle I was good to go! Dry throat = pain. I had wonton soup for dinner this night and it was. So. Good. My throat was beginning to turn back to normal pink and the white was starting to go away! Yay! 

*Day 11- First day driving.* I drove myself to get my car maintenanced this day and my only note was turning my head to Lane change was a bit stiff. I went 8 hours with no meds this day by accidentally forgetting them at home and I do not recommend that at all!! Swallowing water is a bitch but I was able to eat a croissant this day and it was the scratchiest thing I‚Äôve had thus far and it oddly felt good? 

*Day 12- Ready to be healed*. My uvula is still swollen and annoying but I am able to eat most things again if I chew them well enough but thankful for a mostly speedy and safe recovery. Waiting for the day that I can have a good chipotle burrito (rice is small and gets stuck) and some chips and salsa.  ü§£

Get the surgery it is so worth it! Feel free to pm for tips or ask questions here. You‚Äôve got this!! I‚Äôm happy to share my grocery list from prior to surgery with anyone too or talk about the cost of things. 
Thanks for reading my rant. Much love to this sub.

1hp45wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTRelationships/comments/1hp45wy/am_i_insensitive_for_trying_to_figure_out_some/,Am I insensitive for trying to figure out some things without my ex involved ,"Hello, this is a long post and I‚Äôm looking for advice so I will just dive right in. I (m 36) met my ex( m 37) earlier this year and we became txt buddies. If he didnt hear from me in a couple days he would make sure I‚Äôm okay which was very sweet. Before I met him I had and addiction to meth for 2 years.( I‚Äôm now 10 months clean on the 27th) I was in the hospital one year cause of my addiction and prior to leaving my hometown last year I was in a situation where I experienced sexual trauma cause I wanted to get high and I was in pain. After a few dates I went over his house and he disclosed to me that he‚Äôs 18 months sober and I told him that I relapsed and he said that if I ever had the urge to use day or night he has my back. I never been close to anyone that is goin through the same struggle as me. 

However, there‚Äôs one thing. Im hypersexual and poly it took me a while to stand in my truth and I been talkin to him for months about how I‚Äôm feeling for months just to be loud talked, interruptions and saying my standards are low to the point where I just shut down. A few months ago I took a step back from our relationship cause I became tooooo codependent on him to stay sober. If I wanna stay sober I need to be for myself and not a man.( I tried that a couple years ago with another ex that convinced me to leave my hometown and live wit him and work on my sobriety just to be kicked out and be cheated on). My actions wasn‚Äôt aligned with what I was saying and I was overwhelmed. I was struggling to stay sober, figuring out who this person I‚Äôm turning into. And lastly something that broke my heart was my best friend that I was close to passed away of an overdose on fentanyl. I found out a couple days or a week later to him passing amd we wasn‚Äôt on speaking terms. If it wasn‚Äôt for a mutual friend we had in common and he knew how much how close he and I were I would‚Äôve never found out and I was at work. My heart just dropped and it took me two hours to get myself together. 

Through all of that he supported me. He took my attitude and mood swings, if I needed to be taken to work he‚Äôd drop me off and pick me up. 80% of my time was up under him and I became uncomfortable cause I felt like I needed a lil space and Me time. If I needed money he gives it to me and we‚Äôre not together rn, we‚Äôre both potheads so if I need weed he gives it to me and when he needs it I give it to him. He‚Äôs very respectful and responsible. He has a good job, a house and two cars. And to boot he‚Äôs out!!! My last relationship ended that was serious ended cause he wouldn‚Äôt introduce me to his family as his lover but his homeboy( his friends knew who I was but his family didn‚Äôt cause he‚Äôs a preachers kid and they‚Äôre not very close). He means well and he keeps a level head. Our connection isn‚Äôt based on sex just solely emotionally tied and I love him very much. 

A few weeks before Christmas he hmu saying his brother was in the hospital. Most of conversations was about his brother, is he okay, and what happened cause I started to worry about him. Then our conversations started to drift to our normal routine, he knows I have a dark sense of humor and he would send me links to shorts that he knew I would love. Then he started to compliment me on my new facial look( I decided to grow out my beard.). Then he asked me for some help with his brothers car. He‚Äôs asked if I can follow him in his car so he can drive his brother car to his house and I agreed and didnt think anything of it. All the while one of my friends that‚Äôs rooting for us to get married made a point, ‚Äú He don‚Äôt have anybody else to help him out? If I was done wit an ex I‚Äôll be done wit him, he misses u.‚Äù Again I didn‚Äôt think anything of it cause when I broke up wit him I txt him early in the am and I basically blocked him from my phone and muted him on all social media and he said there was no way of gettin back together so my mind wasn‚Äôt on that at all, I just wanted to help him out after everything he‚Äôs done for me when we was together and we technically was still cool and he understood why I took a step back after a conversation we had prior to his brother getting in the hospital. When I unblocked him from my social media and phone, the same day he informed me that his brother was in the hospital. ( Now that part I don‚Äôt think it was a coincidence, God was doing something) 

When we set up to pick up his car he asked if I wanted to go out to eat afterwards( he know I don‚Äôt turn down no free food) so I said sure. While we was driving to our usual buffet spot( I looooooove a good buffet) he informed me that we was goin to a Christmas light show afterwards; IT WAS A DATE!!! He let me know he missed me and I told him I missed him as well, I was naturally gravitating towards him again. After he dropped me off he asked if I wanted to go the movies and if I want to spend the night I said sure. Since then I been spending multiple nights with him cuddling and being affectionate with him.

A couple days ago, this is when shit hits the fan. We wake up early cause I have to go to work. I‚Äôm not much of a talker when I wake up cause my brain is still waking up and I haven‚Äôt had my morning coffee( the devils lettuce iykyk). He says something that was unnecessary, ‚Äú Don‚Äôt wait two weeks from now txtin me in the middle of the night sayin u need some space‚Äùüò≥ for the rest of the ride to my job I was silent cause I didnt want to react. I asked him if we‚Äôre back together and he said no and he told me the reason why he said what he said but at the same time I was still confused( I will explain as I go along trust me this is just my thought process in the heat of the moment cause I can‚Äôt process what‚Äôs happening cause I‚Äôm an emotional person). I try to tell him how I feel and in the blink of an eye I was reminded as to why I broke up wit him in the first place. The loud talking, taking conversations where it dont need to go, and lastly me shutting down and feeling the need to explain myself. I immediately stopped myself and just say I wasn‚Äôt gonna explain myself and I will talk to him later( At this point we‚Äôre outside my job and I didn‚Äôt want to lose my cool at work and have this on my brain when I‚Äôm at work) I proceeded to take my over night bag out his car cause I really didn‚Äôt want to be around him after this discussion after work and I snap but I was gonna FaceTime him later so we can finish our discussion; BAD IDEA!!! He got out of the car and made a complete scene makin me feel very embarrassed( luckily no one was around). He quickly took my bag put it in the car and said he‚Äôll see me when he gets off, I just walked away cause atp, I CAAAAAAAAANT!!!!

I thought my day would be peaceful at work; oh I was wrong!!! I got triggered over a misunderstanding with a coworker that resulted her cussing and fussing at me, I literally forgot where I was I lost control and I got fired and we made a scene outside!!! After I walked away to the train station I just had a breaking point!!! Havin an argument wit my ex is nothin new, but losing my job on the same day I‚Äôm pissed!!! He picks me up and we finish our conversation where he informed me that he felt embarrassed how I broke up with him, rightfully so but I was prepared for what he was gonna say next. He really doesn‚Äôt have a close relationship to his parents cause he‚Äôs a product of his father having an affair. His mother died when he was young and his father took him in and his step mother doesn‚Äôt like him very much. He told me that his step mother said that she could look at me and tell that I wasn‚Äôt about anything and that I was gonna leave like the other guys before me and his brother kinda rubbed it in his face when we broke up and at the same time he‚Äôs asking me can we work on our relationship. I told him not to talk to me so I can process what I just heard. I‚Äôm not saying what I did was right nor am i victim in this by any means. I literally was overwhelmed with my personal issues and I was tooo codependent on him and I‚Äôm not used to someone loving me like this without any kind of abuse‚Ä¶ 

Ever since then I been in his room just keepin to myself. Yesterday he apologized for what was said about me however, just to put me in the middle of ur crossfire cause u don‚Äôt like ur step son is a complete Nono for me. And his brother I can fault him for havin an opinion atleast he‚Äôs the one and his other brother got to know me so I‚Äôm not mad at him at all. As far as his mom whether we work it out or not I don‚Äôt wanna meet his parents at all!!! He also apologized for actin the way he did infront of my job and it was out of fear that he will never speak to me again and I understand where he‚Äôs coming from. At the same time the last couple nights  haven‚Äôt been affectionate with him and I‚Äôm regretting my actions of spending time with him. I told him he gave me a lot to think about and process cause I can‚Äôt go through this crap again. 

I‚Äôm going back home for new years for a couple days it was gonna be a celebration of me bein sober and back in my career but due to me getting fired I‚Äôm still gonna celebrate my sobriety but also think what I‚Äôm gonna think a lot about what happened. I‚Äôm feeling like I need some more time after this week and continue my journey in therapy and put my energy in the gym but need some advice if I‚Äôm being a dick????",1,1735501901.0,LGBTRelationships,0,1.0,False

√Ä l'approche du dernier jour de la campagne, Ben se sent plus confiant que jamais. Il a vu l'enthousiasme de son √©quipe, le soutien des √©lecteurs et l'√©lan qu'il a pris, et il est plus convaincu que jamais qu'il a une chance de remporter la victoire, malgr√© ce que les experts peuvent penser. Cependant, il restait encore un jour de campagne, et il savait qu'il y avait toujours plus de travail √† faire.



8-9 heures - L'√©quipe du matin



Pour commencer la journ√©e, Ben se rend √† Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. L√†, il a rencontr√© des travailleurs industriels qui entraient dans les usines pour travailler pour la journ√©e. Il leur a pr√©sent√© les politiques syndicales des lib√©raux. Il a soulign√© le fait qu'il √©tait fortement en faveur des syndicats et qu'il se battrait toujours pour eux √† Ottawa. Il leur a √©galement offert toute une s√©rie de d√©licieuses friandises, du caf√© aux bagels en passant par les beignets. Bien s√ªr, les beignets √©taient recouverts d'un gla√ßage rouge lib√©ral, et c'est peut-√™tre la raison pour laquelle tant de gens sont venus lui parler. Cependant, il aime √† penser que cela a aussi un peu √† voir avec ses politiques.



9h30-11h- Promenade √† Longueuil



Ben s'est ensuite rendu √† Longueuil, en banlieue de Montr√©al. Il a parl√© aux banlieusards et a brandi des pancartes lib√©rales aux passages pi√©tons, encourageant les gens √† voter pour lui et pour Avtron. Apr√®s toutes ces activit√©s, il a d√©cid√© d'aller parler √† d'autres personnes dans une √©picerie. Il leur a parl√© du co√ªt de la vie et du plan lib√©ral de construction de logements. Il a parl√© aux r√©sidents d'un nouveau projet de construction de logements √† proximit√© et leur a expliqu√© les plans visant √† minimiser les perturbations quotidiennes tout en maximisant l'utilisation de l'√©nergie. 

12- 14h30- Sherbrooke, encore



Ben retourne √† Sherbrooke pour un d√©jeuner rapide, mais nous n'avons pas pu confirmer o√π il est all√© chercher son repas. Ce que nous pouvons confirmer, par contre, c'est qu'il a parl√© √† la caissi√®re et au personnel de l'√©tablissement. Il a ensuite proc√©d√© √† une nouvelle s√©rie d'interviews, qu'il consid√®re comme le moyen le plus important de gagner des voix. Apr√®s tout, il est beaucoup plus difficile d'ignorer une voix √† la radio si elle est diffus√©e sur toutes les stations qu'un simple panneau de jardin, ou du moins c'est sa logique.



15 h 30 - 18 h - Derni√®res remarques √† Drummondville



Apr√®s tout cela, il s'est rendu au dernier endroit de sa campagne, Drummondville. Il prononce un dernier discours devant ses partisans √† Drummondville, et sa campagne prend enfin fin. Il a ressenti beaucoup d'espoir dans son avenir et dans celui du Canada.

ENGLISH

As the final day of the campaign looms, Ben is feeling more confident than ever. He saw the enthusiasm of his staff, the support of the voters, and the momentum he had, and he felt better than ever that he had a fighting chance of victory, despite what the pundits might think. However, there was one more day of the campaign left, and he knew there was always more work to do.



8-9am- Morning Shift



To kick off the day, Ben headed to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. There, he met with industrial workers entering the factories to work for the day. He gave them the pitch on the Liberal‚Äôs union policies. He noted the fact that he was strongly pro union, and the fact that he would always fight for them in Ottawa. He also gave them a range of delicious treats, from coffee to bagels to donuts. Of course, the donuts had Liberal red frosting, and perhaps that‚Äôs why so many people went to talk to him. However, he‚Äôd like to think it had a little bit to do with his policies too.



9:30-11am- Longueuil Walk



Next up, Ben visited the Montreal suburb of Longueuil. He spoke to commuters and waved Liberal signs in crosswalks, encouraging people to vote for him and Avtron. After all of this activity, he decided to go in and speak to more people at a grocery store. He talked to them about the cost of living, and discussed the Liberal plan to build more housing. He spoke to residents about a new housing development going up nearby, and he explained the plans to minimize daily disruption while maximising growth. He got several friendly handshakes, and felt like he had flipped a couple of votes with that visit. While there, he also visited T√©l√© Rive-Sud for a quick interview. While it was just a quick interview, primarily focused on personal experiences with his riding, all efforts count when it is so close.



12- 2:30pm- Sherbrooke, again



Ben returns to Sherbrooke for a quick lunch, although we could not confirm where he went to get his meal. What we can confirm, however, is that he spoke to the cashier and the staff of the establishment. After this, he did another round of interviews, seeing them as the most important way to win votes. After all, it's much harder to ignore a voice on the radio if it's on all the stations than a simple yard sign, or at least that's his logic.



3:30- 6pm- Final remarks in Drummondville



After all of this, he travelled to the final location of his campaign, Drummondville. He delivered some final remarks to his supporters in Drummondville, and finally, his campaign came to a close. He felt a great amount of hope in his future, and the future of Canada.",1,1735501848.0,ElectionsCMHoC,0,1.0,False

-Day hikes (under 10km so we can carry baby without too much trouble, trolltunga is something we'd have done without carrying a little )
-Kayaking or biking or other outdoor activities  - hoping to avoid mass boat tours if we can but do want to enjoy the scenery

I‚Äôve attempted so many times, but it never really happened. This is the first time I‚Äôve actually finished a thing.

I shared it on Substack as anonymous, thinking no one would know it was me. But then I realized I already had followers... so now people know I wrote it. I guess I have to be open about it now, and honestly, I‚Äôm already having anxiety.

Here it is - 

# Small Talk, Big Feelings

I got into the coffee shop. Everyone was sitting alone, working on something. Maybe one person was reading a book. I was talking to my mom on the phone, but I realized I should be quiet because it‚Äôs so quiet here. Too quiet. People looked at me. Was it because I was speaking a different language? Or was I just too loud?

‚ÄúOkay, Mom, I‚Äôll call you later,‚Äù I said quickly, lowering my voice before ending the call. Coffee shops shouldn‚Äôt be places to socialize, meet your friends, talk, and laugh‚Äîor at least not in New York, I think.

I was in the line, waiting for my turn. I was getting closer to the barista. What do I say to her? Should I ask how her day is going? Or maybe about her weekend? Wouldn‚Äôt she be tired of answering the same questions over and over? What if she thought,¬†*‚ÄúAgain with the same question?‚Äù*

She probably had an early morning shift over the weekend. Even if she went out, she must have hated getting up at 6 a.m. to open the coffee shop. Or should I just ask how she‚Äôs doing? She‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù then ask me, and I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù And I‚Äôll feel awkward again because I‚Äôm never good at talking about my day unless I feel close to someone.

Why shouldn‚Äôt I tell her I‚Äôm going to my jewelry class? But why would she care? I should keep it simple‚Äîjust ask how she‚Äôs doing and order my coffee. That‚Äôs it. Should I tell her my drink order right after, or keep the conversation going like New Yorkers do? Or just say ‚Äúhi‚Äù? Yes. Just say hi.

Ah, it‚Äôs my turn. I‚Äôll ask her how it‚Äôs going.

‚ÄúHi, can I get a black coffee?‚Äù

Damn it, I couldn‚Äôt ask her again. Why do I keep failing at this? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll never be friends with the neighborhood baristas. What is wrong with me? Why am I overthinking this? Why is this so hard?

Maybe I should have told her how beautiful her shirt is, and then I could‚Äôve asked where she got it. But it‚Äôs too late. I saw another customer had already started talking to her. He was telling her about his vacation in Canada and how nice Canadians are. She nodded, giving those polite ‚ÄúWow, I believe it‚Äù responses. She didn‚Äôt seem interested, but he didn‚Äôt notice. He just kept talking. Why would he? He just wants to be seen too‚Äîby telling her about his beautiful weekend in Canada while she‚Äôs stuck working early shifts two days in a row. And it‚Äôs Monday.

I grabbed my coffee and left. Walking to the subway, it was cold outside, but there was a beautiful breeze. The air smelled fresh. That doesn‚Äôt happen often. Then someone stopped me. ‚ÄúHey, I just wanted to say, you have such a unique style.‚Äù

Do I? Really? It‚Äôs just a hat and a black jacket. He said the hat makes all the difference. A $5 hat from H&M. ‚ÄúAh, thank you,‚Äù I said.

Small talk. It‚Äôs strange, confusing, even anxiety-inducing. But sometimes, it surprises you. Sometimes, it matters.

I‚Äôve been there a year, when I joined the place was a shambles, team didn‚Äôt even know how to carry a tray. I‚Äôve worked hard to rebuild it and my guarantee to the team was always ‚Äúyou come first, I have a zero tolerance of abuse‚Äù. 

So anyway, I‚Äôm on the evening shift and when I get to work I‚Äôm informed there was an ‚Äúincident‚Äù at breakfast. So I quickly go and read the reports, one from my GM and one from my supervisor who was on the breakfast shift. They matched. So a guest who had hosted a private dinner with us the night before arrived at 10:35 for breakfast. Breakfast closes at 10:30 and our chefs are pretty strict on it since they then don‚Äôt have much time to flip to lunch service. My supervisor informs the guest of this and says ‚Äúlet me just go talk to the kitchen and see what I can do, in the meantime please help yourself to the continental buffet‚Äù. Perfect response, exactly what I would have done. 

The guest explodes on her. How this is crazy blah blah all the usual. My GM happens to be walking through the restaurant to get a coffee at this time so he jumps in. Somewhere along the line, they turn to my supervisor and tell her ‚Äúyou should just kill yourself‚Äù. My GM told the kitchen they had to make their breakfast AND MADE MY SUPERVISOR SERVE THEM. 

I stormed up to his office, ballistic, and asked him WTF he thought he was doing. I understand trying to find a solution to a situation, and to an extent we always have to wash away things a guest says to us to move beyond it with the solution, but no way in that scenario. I told him if I had been there, the second they said that I would have kicked them out of the hotel. Their checkout was in 25 minutes anyway, wouldn‚Äôt have even thought twice about it.

We chat online and occasionally meet up irl for coffee/mini golf/bowling. Recently, however, they came to me (online) and told me that they ‚Äòare a transgender woman now‚Äô and want to go by Sarah instead (not real name either). Furthermore, they mentioned that I‚Äôm one of only two people they‚Äôve told, alongside their mother.

The issue is that this makes me horrendously uncomfortable. I hate the idea of them being in my life as a female friend since I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to get over knowing- and dating- them as a male. I don‚Äôt want to be a part of their life during this period of their transition, and I‚Äôm not comfortable supporting them right now.

I don‚Äôt think baby ever had sleep regression BECAUSE SHE HAS NEVER SLEPT. Trying to sleep train AGAIN during the holidays when staying up for 26hrs then making it to family events is NOT IT. i cant mask anymore at this point

Trying to entertain 4yo without him attacking baby on accident (i think hes just as adhd as me at this point) i can barely give him enough stimulation and attention looking after baby so he is getting DANGEROUS energy now. 

Trying to keep up with TRYING to sleep train baby and still give LO attention while im staying up until 6am every night is IMPOSSIBLE. 

Feel like i want to quit pumping but when i FINALLY get enough milk after days of pumping and i use it i feel accomplished and simultaneously depressed that im feeding it to baby. 

My house is DISGUSTING which makes me MORE depressed because im still trying to figure out how to balance LO and Baby with no energy and have NOTHING left to put towards housework-or even making my own food for that matter 

They gave me meds for ppd and says ‚Äúyour body has to get used to it‚Äù but how can i get used to it when it gives me energy at the wrong times but knocks me on my ass when im supposed to be alive to take care of babies on my own. 

Im getting such baby manic/depressive episodes i lash out then cry, don‚Äôt wanna be around my baby but wanna be around LO or the other way around but sucks to handle them together on my own while hubbys at work. 

Hubbys trying to balance EVERYTHING when hes home but im still just off the rails no matter what then i want HIM to sleep so SOMEONE can be alive for the kids

Coffee and energy drinks do nothing but make me anxious and more tired. 

I have NO idea what to do at this point. Staying up for 26 hrs straight is k!lling EVERYONE in the household.

1hp3u0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hp3u0l,Water sensor issue Ninja CFP307/301,"Issue: coffee maker says ""add water"" despite having water available and pumping water as the error occurs.

Attempted repairs: Ran multiple cleaning cycles as suggested by manufacturer. Cleaning cycles with water run with no issue an no ""add water"" message.

Additional actions taken: dismantled everything and verified no blocked tubes. Heater core/tube is clean, with no scale buildup at all.

Used a volt meter on the water sensor wires connected to the pump and see 5volts from red to black and red to white. White to black shows no voltage until pump is running. While pump is running, voltages from white to black jump around inconsistently from <1vdc to 5vdc.

I'm assuming my issue is the water sensor giving inconsistent readings to the control board. I'm not certain how the water sensor is designed to work. Seems to be pressure or flow related. It's secured or glued inside a housing connected to the inlet side (pipe nipple) of the pump so I'm not sure if I can remove it without risking a leaky housing.

I've used a .4mm needle to attempt to possibly unblock a peice of calcium buildup but that involves just blindly stabbing and I'm not sure it is doing anything useful.

Anyone have any advice? Not sure how replaceable the motor assembly is, as there is only a part number on the motor, not the water pump and sensor assembly connected to the motor.",2,1735501023.0,ElectronicsRepair,2,1.0,False

1hp3qb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1hp3qb2/are_girls_like_this_common_here_is_a_story_how_a/,Are girls like this common here is a story How a Girl's Lies and Manipulation Nearly Ruined Everything,"How a Girl‚Äôs Lies and Manipulation Nearly Ruined My Life

Hey, I‚Äôm 18M, and I‚Äôm in 12th grade now. In a few months, I‚Äôll finally leave behind the nightmare that has been my school life. But before that, I want to share my story‚Äîthe story of how a girl, fueled by her delusions and petty vendettas, almost destroyed me.

It started way back in the third grade. Our teacher, in her infinite wisdom, decided to pair students based on academic performance‚Äî‚Äúweak‚Äù ones with ‚Äústrong‚Äù ones. I got paired with her. Let‚Äôs call her Kavya. From day one, she wasn‚Äôt fond of me. I don‚Äôt know what it was‚Äîmaybe my quiet nature rubbed her the wrong way‚Äîbut she made it clear she thought I didn‚Äôt belong.

Fast forward to middle school, and things only got worse. Kavya was one of those girls who had the perfect mix of popularity and pretty privilege. Everyone liked her. Me? I was the introverted, awkward kid, but I had a good friend group‚Äîa bunch of kids who adopted me despite my shy nature.

But then came the incident. One day, in a moment of pure coincidence, I made a lip-smacking sound, and she somehow interpreted it as a ‚Äúflying kiss.‚Äù I swear it was nothing of the sort. But Kavya? She twisted it into a personal attack, dredging up some harassment case involving another guy and projecting all of it onto me. It was like she decided right then and there that I was the villain in her story.

And boy, did she act on that.

She started spreading rumors‚Äînasty ones. That I was dirty, that I was poor, that I harassed her. She‚Äôd weaponize her popularity to make me the laughingstock of the school. Kids would call me ‚Äústinky,‚Äù mock me in the hallways, and treat me like dirt.

What hurt the most was when my own friend group began to pull away. None of them believed her lies‚Äîthank God for that. But the constant criticism and bullying from others forced them to distance themselves. It wasn‚Äôt their fault, I guess. No one wants to be on the receiving end of that kind of targeted hate.

Then, our school shut down, and we all moved to a new one. I thought maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôd get a fresh start. But nope. Kavya carried her crusade against me to the new school. She made sure everyone ‚Äúknew‚Äù about me before I even had a chance to introduce myself. I became the outcast‚Äîsocially isolated, bullied, and miserable.

By 9th grade, all my old friends had switched schools. I was left behind, stuck in a place where Kavya‚Äôs manipulations ran unchecked. Every day felt like a battle just to keep my head above water. I turned to caffeine to cope. I‚Äôd chug coffee just to get through the day, hoping the buzz would drown out the exhaustion of constantly defending my existence.

There was one friend I truly thought would stick by me. Let‚Äôs call him Raj. He was the one who brought me into our friend group back in the old school, the one who saw through Kavya‚Äôs lies from the start. But Raj left too‚Äîgot a sports scholarship at another school and moved on. He found new friends and forgot about me. That betrayal hurt more than anything.

And Kavya? She didn‚Äôt stop. Even at our farewell, she found a way to humiliate me. Someone from a junior group chat I was part of called her out for something, and so did the rest. She automatically assumed it was me. While she herself crammed into some tiny car and came for the event, she called me ‚Äúbroke‚Äù for not driving there myself. The truth? I couldn‚Äôt drive, so I took a cab. What‚Äôs the big deal?

Oh, and the outfit-shaming? Classic Kavya. One of her minions sneered at my jacket, calling it something a pan shop owner would wear. But when he saw it was D&G, the look on his face was priceless.

But you know what? I‚Äôve survived. Despite everything, I‚Äôm still here. A few more months, and I‚Äôll be out of this hellhole, leaving Kavya and her toxic circus behind.

Looking back, I realize she never really ‚Äúruined‚Äù my life. Sure, she made it hell for a while, but I‚Äôm still standing. And I know, deep down, that her actions say more about her insecurities than anything about me.

To anyone going through something similar‚Äîstay strong. The people who matter will see through the lies, and the ones who believe them? They were never worth your time anyway.

1hp3njp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1hp3njp/is_this_not_fair/,Is this not fair?! ,"Ok. Settle a debate. This has happened a few times so time to hear out others opinions. 

On weekends, husband and I take turns sleeping in. Our toddler is an early riser and it's nice to get 1 morning a week that you don't have to get out of bed before the sun and instantly start catering to the tiny boss. 
 Today was my husband's morning to sleep in. Although he has been off work all week and because it was Christmas, we haven't been as rigid about who gets what morning. I probably got less ""sleep ins"" than him because we had early rising family visiting but wasn't keeping track. 

Anyways, we agreed that husband would sleep in last night as I got to the previous morning. Except our toddler is quite sick and woke up at 4am after their medicine wore off and their fever returned. I spent almost an hour tending to their needs and rocking them back to sleep, all while monitoring symptoms and debating if a trip to the emergency room would be warranted as there's no doctors open on sundays. I go back to bed and lay awake due to husband's snoring for probably 20 minutes. 30 minutes after that, toddler had woken up again but I was able to just check on the camera and stand at their door way and they just did their tired cry a few times before falling back asleep so never had to go back in. 

Thankfully toddler slept in a bit as a result of the rough night. 8am to be exact. When I heard them cry out, I woke up my husband to get up because I figured he just got to sleep until 8 without having to get up in the middle of the night and it felt like I had just got back to sleep. Except he instantly pitched a bit of a fit and says it isn't fair. I told him I was up for over an hour in the middle of the night. He still insists that it's his morning to sleep in and so I'm not being fair.I say that deal should be null and void if I'm the one to get up in the middle of the night (and....it's always me doing so. Though it usually only happens once a week).  I start to get out of bed because I'm now annoyed, but he, also annoyed, says he will get up. After a coffee, he is less grumpy with me. But I found out he stayed up really late playing video games which is why the 8am wake up wasn't good enough for him (typically sleeping until 8am is like the gold standard for sleeping in) 

So...AITA? Or should the ""sleeping in"" arrangement be null and void if one of us has to wake up and deal with a sick kid in the middle of the night?! ",1,1735500545.0,Mommit,5,1.0,False

Even before the Ducks beat them in the Rose Bowl, you have to admire their perseverance. Picture it: waking up in December to sub-zero temperatures, gray skies, and the grim prospect of shoveling snow before plopping down into a scarlet-gray folding chair to watch a football game. There's no Mt. Hood to escape to, no coastline to see - just endless miles of cornfields and maybe a scenic Waffle House off I-70 if you're feeling adventurous.

What fuels Ohio State fans you ask? Skyline Chili. We're talking about a chocolate-cinnamon spaghetti which taste about as bad as it sounds. [Even Ohio natives have a tough time swallowing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/jttgs9/skyline_chili_is_trash/). Contrast this with us spoiled Ducks fans - savoring craft beer, locally roasted coffee, and fresh meals after a game. The difference in one group living life, the other enduring it.

However, let's not be cruel. After all, Ohio State fans will have suffered enough. They've endured four straight losses to Michigan and now they have to face us, the embodiment of West Coast cool. They may claim tradition, but tradition doesn't warm you up when tailgating in freezing rain. It doesn't make gray skies any less depressing or turn canned chili into gourmet cuisine.

So, ducks fan, as we prepare for victory, let's consider showing kindness to Ohio State fans. A few tips:

**1. Acknowledge Their Struggles**

*Losing to Michigan twice and now Oregon twice? That's a tough run. But hey at least you've got Skyline Chili.*

**2. Acknowledge their Game Experience**

*The Horseshoe is impressive. It must be exhilarating to watch games surrounded by 100,000 fans... even more exhilarating to leave and realize you're still in Ohio.*

**3. Offer Travel Suggestions**

*After the game, consider coming out to Oregon. We'll take you on a hike or to a mountain - both guaranteed  to have more elevation than your entire state.*

Ultimately, Ohio State fans don't need us rubbing salt in their wounds. Let's win with grace, after all we've already got the better football team, lifestyle, and weather.",0,1735500365.0,ducks,17,0.42,False

I 30M and my ex 26F broke up 2 months ago. At the time we were living in her town for around 7 months. And we had been together for 2 years. 1year and 3 months BF&GF. 
We broke up and I felt overwhelmed and decided to go back to my town to start therapy, work on myself and to give distance to the break up. 

I have another post explaining more about the break up. 

Long story short, we had been in contact during this two months. Mostly started by her. We had spoke about the reasons why we broke up. But still we both care a lot about the other and the feelings of love and longing are clear. We chat, we laugh and support each other. 

One week ago I told her that I‚Äôm coming back to her town to re start my life. Work, hobbies, friends and of course to see her. I really like that place and my life there. So going back is my choice even over what could happen with her. 

She was really receptive about it, and happy that I‚Äôm going back. She literally said that she wants to meet up the moment I arrive so we can go for a coffee beers or whatever. 

I think, even I‚Äôm doing this because I grow to really like that place and that feels as home, I would really like for something to happen between us. 

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm writing this. It‚Äôs maybe to vent, to see if someone got some advice or even just to put into words what is on my mind.

‚ÄúIf they would give us lockers so we could all go to work and store our stuff somewhere where we know it‚Äôs not going to be stolen. So I can go to work peacefully and realize, ‚Äòhey, my stuff is still going to be there when I get off work,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs comforting. You know how hard it is to go to work, come back, and your blankets stolen, and it‚Äôs cold. It‚Äôs hard, and then you got to find another blanket,‚Äù he added.

He says a public charging station would also be helpful for those in his predicament.

‚ÄúYou need a phone to go to work and better your life and do these things,‚Äù he said.

These types of programs exist elsewhere in the county, organized by churches, local governments or non profits, and can be set up at very low costs.

Why not use an empty plot of Jacobs land sitting idle for years which could be a designated base for non profits wanting to help, as a go to spot for healthy food, drop-offs and pickups for laundry, coffee and conversations, a locker area, a charging center, a free clothes market and a non uniformed rotating social worker on hand? There could be occasional free haircut days, and why not add a few bathrooms and showers?

With a minimal budget, it could do worlds of good, and help people get back on a path toward being housed.

We could have used the former Record Street shelter for these purposes, as a low-cost city alternative to the county‚Äôs intimidating and not very welcoming Cares Campus, as a hub for volunteers to help, but elected council members have decided to sell it instead to developers.

The app - worked mostly fine for me, but my partner's medallion glitched out the last three days and showed him constantly on the Lido deck even when we were in the Theater, Princess Live, our stateroom, etc. 

The ship - huge! I know it's not the biggest in the fleet but for my first cruise it was a bit overwhelming at first. The app was actually super helpful with routing me where I wanted to go. Our stateroom (deluxe balcony) was beautiful and the bed was super comfortable! I spent quite a lot of time on our balcony. 

Package - we (2 adults) purchased Plus when we booked BUT we went to the ship orientation the first afternoon and won the drawing for an upgrade to Premier, so that was a great way to start the week! While I'm not a big drinker, it was nice to not have to worry about hitting the 15 limit on mocktails/coffees/soda/countless bottles of water. It was also nice getting the 3 free photo prints from the week. Since we upgraded on day 1 there were almost no specialty dining reservations left but we did manage to squeeze into the Italian restaurant on the last day. 

Food - it was fine. We had two meals in the dining room (a breakfast and a dinner) that were SO slow (30-40 minutes between app and main). We went to one tea service which was super packed so not all that fun. So we mostly stuck to the buffet which was mostly ok. Nothing too exciting. I know the desserts are controversial but for the most part I enjoyed them, especially the banana/pistachio breads which could be found in both the patisserie and the international cafe. I did two OceanNow orders which took ~30 minutes which is about what I expected. 

That being said we did eat one lunch at Alfredo's which was great and the Italian place the last night which was phenomenal. 

Service - fantastic! Our steward was amazing, the activities crew were super friendly, and the bartenders were super efficient (especially at the Princess Live cafe which was always busy). I was highly entertained by the cruise director (Olivia). 

Shows/activities - I attended tons of things throughout the week from Zumba to trivia to comedy shows to production shows (Fiera and Born to Dance). I thought the magic show was extremely mid but other than that everything was fine to great. I super recommend the presentations by the activities staff and bridge officers on the last day to hear about how the ship works.

Ports - The snorkeling at Roatan was very enjoyable. We did the Altun Ha ruins in Belize which were a definite highlight of the trip. In Cozumel we just shopped in port which was what we expected to do. If we did this itinerary again we'd probably do an excursion in Roatan.

Overall we had a wonderful time and we'll definitely be sailing again with Princess!",5,1735499675.0,PrincessCruises,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 29 weeks pregnant, long-time migraine sufferer, and currently in the middle of a really intense, unresponsive migraine. I‚Äôve been through a gamut of meds with OB & my neuro and I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I‚Äôve tried and been unresponsive to Tylenol, Fioricet, Flexeril, Metoclopramide, and Sumatriptan.

I started to get a mild headache yesterday morning so I took 1gm of Tylenol and made an electrolyte drink trying to head it off. We went to a Christmas gathering with family, had lunch, and it started getting worse to where I thought it was turning into a migraine. I immediately took 25mg sumatriptan and sat down on the couch for a nap. 2 hours later & it was only getting worse, so I took 50mg sumatriptan (cleared by neuro to take up to 200mg/24 hrs). It kept getting worse so we headed home and I got another electrolyte drink on the way home. 

Once we got home I tried an at home ER cocktail (metoclopramide+tylenol+benadryl) and went straight to bed with an ice pack on my head. I slept horribly, waking up every couple hours to use the bathroom and switching out my ice pack. Finally around 2 am I got up and took another dose of metoclopramide + Tylenol, ate a PB&J and drank a glass of milk, then sat in the recliner with a heating pad on my back and an ice pack on my head.

My kid woke me up around 6am (he was quiet and calm) so I switched out my ice pack again, drank a coffee and ate some breakfast, and took another at home ER cocktail at 8am. Since then I‚Äôve been in bed, ice packs on head. I can‚Äôt sleep anymore. I have a McDonald‚Äôs Diet Coke and fry on the way and I‚Äôm taking a warm (not too hot) bath mixed Epsom salt & baking soda with more ice packs on my head and chugging another electrolyte drink while I wait for food.

I‚Äôll also add that I‚Äôve been drinking lots of ice cold water through this whole episode, so I am certainly not dehydrated.

If anyone has any advice for what I can do (besides going to the ER) I would greatly appreciate it.",0,1735499621.0,migraine,8,0.5,False
1hp3as5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1hp3as5/lack_of_panic_about_actual_scary_situations/,Lack of panic about actual scary situations,"I can get very stressed out about minor social issues (last week had a fight-or-flight moment over a queueing irregularity at a coffee shop that left me upset for several hours) but I've been in a few situations that, by all accounts, should be terrifying but weren't. I've been robbed at gunpoint twice and in both incidents I was annoyed at losing some money but not actually scared. 

Both times, the other people with me said they were shaking afterwards. Female colleagues in the first robbery and male partner in the second. I also managed to keep my phone by lying that I'd left it in my car and turning my body slightly so the robber didn't realize my skirt had a pocket. My partner was forced to hand his over.

There's a couple of explanations I can think of 

1) this is a situation where there's a pretty straightforward script, ""Your money or your life"". OK take my money and fok off. 
Unlike someone cutting queue or me accidentally cutting someone at the coffee shop when the whole queueing protocol is derailed and then it's awkward and horrible.

2) assuming everybody else is a rational actor. Even criminals are smart enough to know that the police effort to catch them and the judicial sentences will be worse for murder than robbery, so they don't really want to shoot us either.

I‚Äôm thinking about **Shawlands** instead because I love Pollok Country Park and all the cute independent coffee shops, bakeries, and brunch spots. Plus, the rent is so much more affordable compared to the West End.

That said, after spending seven years in Partick, I‚Äôm used to its convenience, everything‚Äôs within walking distance. I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll feel about a 30-minute trip to the city centre or not having a milk tea shop or Chinese supermarket nearby.

Every morning for years, I woke up feeling like a zombie. My energy levels were nonexistent, and my mirror reminded me that my body wasn‚Äôt exactly where I wanted it to be. No matter how much I exercised or how carefully I counted calories, the scale didn‚Äôt budge. Enter Java Burn.

I stumbled across Java Burn while scrolling through one of those late-night online rabbit holes. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI‚Äôve fallen for enough ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù gimmicks before. But something about the idea of a tasteless powder that worked with my daily coffee intrigued me. I figured, why not? Coffee was already my lifeline, so adding Java Burn to the mix seemed like a no-brainer.

Day one with Java Burn felt... ordinary. It blended seamlessly into my coffee, just as promised. No weird aftertaste, no gritty texture, nothing to suggest I‚Äôd just added a metabolic supercharger to my routine. I sipped, went about my day, and didn‚Äôt think much of it. But by day three, I noticed a shift.

My mornings became something entirely new. Instead of dragging myself out of bed, I found myself feeling lighter, almost energized before my first cup of coffee. Java Burn seemed to work quietly behind the scenes, nudging my metabolism to wake up before I did. And then the real magic began.

Within two weeks, I felt sharper, more alive. My clothes began to fit differently‚Äînot dramatically, but enough to make me do a double-take in the mirror. I wasn‚Äôt starving myself or hitting the gym like a maniac. I was just sticking to my usual routine, with one difference: Java Burn.

Fast forward to month three, and it felt like I was living someone else‚Äôs life. I wasn‚Äôt just losing weight‚ÄîI was shedding years of frustration. My energy soared, my focus sharpened, and my confidence skyrocketed. Java Burn wasn‚Äôt just about weight loss for me. It felt like I‚Äôd unlocked a new gear in my life, one where everything was just... easier.

I dug into the science behind Java Burn because I wanted to know why it worked so well. Ingredients like green tea extract and green coffee bean extract aren‚Äôt new, but something about the way Java Burn combined them with vitamins and amino acids seemed to hit the sweet spot. It‚Äôs like they cracked the code for supercharging your coffee into a fat-burning powerhouse.

Now, I talk about Java Burn to anyone who will listen. My friends, my family, even my coworkers‚Äîall of them have seen the difference it‚Äôs made in my life. And when they ask if it‚Äôs just another fad, I tell them the truth: Java Burn isn‚Äôt about shortcuts. It‚Äôs about giving your body what it needs to function at its best.

Of course, everyone‚Äôs experience with Java Burn might be different. But for me, it was the key to unlocking a version of myself I didn‚Äôt think was possible. I still drink my coffee every morning, but now it‚Äôs more than a ritual. With Java Burn, it‚Äôs a daily dose of transformation.

If you‚Äôre like I was‚Äîstuck, frustrated, and tired of trying everything without results‚ÄîJava Burn might just be the thing that changes your life. It‚Äôs not flashy or overhyped. It‚Äôs just effective. And sometimes, that‚Äôs all you need.

## Java Burn Ingredients 

What makes Java Burn so effective? That question became my obsession after I started seeing real results. I wanted to understand how this simple, tasteless powder could work so well when so many other methods had failed me. The answer lies in the meticulously chosen ingredients. Java Burn isn‚Äôt just a random mix of trendy components‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully formulated blend designed to target stubborn fat and supercharge metabolism.

Let‚Äôs start with **green tea extract**, one of the power players in Java Burn. It‚Äôs no secret that green tea has been hailed for its fat-burning properties, but Java Burn takes it to the next level. The catechins in green tea extract help to boost metabolism by encouraging your body to burn fat for energy. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs loaded with antioxidants that not only help with weight loss but also improve overall health. Within weeks of using Java Burn, I felt like my body was working more efficiently, and I suspect this ingredient played a big role.

Another standout is **green coffee bean extract**, which contains chlorogenic acid. This compound has been linked to better blood sugar control, which is essential for curbing cravings and avoiding those mid-afternoon energy crashes. Before Java Burn, I was a snack-aholic, always looking for something to nibble on to keep my energy up. After starting Java Burn, those cravings faded, and I found myself naturally eating smaller portions without even trying.

Then there‚Äôs **L-carnitine**, an amino acid that‚Äôs all about energy production. L-carnitine helps your body convert fat stores into usable energy. This isn‚Äôt just about burning fat; it‚Äôs about feeling good while you do it. I used to feel drained after workouts, but once I started using Java Burn, my energy levels stayed consistent. It‚Äôs as if my body had finally learned how to use fat as fuel instead of stubbornly storing it.

**L-theanine** is another gem in Java Burn‚Äôs formula. This amino acid is known for its calming properties, which might seem counterintuitive for a product designed to rev you up. But trust me, it‚Äôs genius. The balance between caffeine and L-theanine gave me the best of both worlds: focused energy without the jitters. Java Burn transformed my morning coffee from a necessity into a tool that helped me stay on top of my day with laser-like focus.

Finally, **chromium** rounds out the formula, working to stabilize blood sugar levels. If you‚Äôve ever experienced the highs and lows of sugar crashes, you know how frustrating it can be to maintain energy and avoid overindulging. Java Burn‚Äôs chromium content helped me regulate those spikes, which made sticking to a healthier lifestyle effortless.

Of course, Java Burn doesn‚Äôt stop at weight loss. Its added vitamins‚Äîlike **B6, B12, and D**‚Äîensure you‚Äôre not just shedding pounds but also supporting overall wellness. These vitamins are essential for energy production, metabolism, and even mood regulation. I didn‚Äôt just look better after using Java Burn‚ÄîI felt better too.

The synergy of these ingredients is what makes Java Burn a game-changer. On their own, each component is effective, but together, they create a formula that doesn‚Äôt just burn fat but also improves how your body functions overall. With Java Burn, I wasn‚Äôt just losing weight‚ÄîI was unlocking a healthier, more energized version of myself.

Every time I sip my morning coffee with Java Burn, I‚Äôm reminded of how simple it is to take control of your health. No crazy diets, no exhausting workout regimens‚Äîjust smart science working in harmony with my body. Java Burn didn‚Äôt just help me lose weight; it gave me the freedom to enjoy life without constantly worrying about the scale. And for that, I‚Äôll always be grateful.

I'll start with France ! 

‚Ä¢ Buy them directly from the bank : 
As a french citizen you can directly call them and Ask for a roll of any type of coin from 1cent to 2‚Ç¨ but you have to be a client of the said bank.
As a foreigner that is not possible 

‚Ä¢ Ask for change : 
In small coffee shops or bakeries, they do have a lot of 2‚Ç¨ coins, just ask them to show them to you and if you do find a cool one, just swap it with a regular one you prepared in advance.

‚Ä¢ Keep your family informed about your research, they can also help you by looking in their own piggybank !

1hp3229,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hp3229/wrapping_my_head_around_the_espresso_machine/,Wrapping my head around the espresso machine options ($500-$2000),"I'm looking to get my first espresso machine. I'm miles away from thinking about specific models, but am focused on the array of different strategies I can take. To be honest, I'm a little underwhelmed by all of them, so I thought I'd reach out and see whether I'm appreciating the relevant tradeoffs.

My goal here is to reproduce the heavenly experience of drinking espresso drinks in Northen Italy, where even the baristas at service plazas on the highway pull perfect, rich, balanced, caramelly shots that coat your mouth with thick, satisfying espresso goodness and linger on your pallet for ages. I'm not talking bitter, aggressive espresso, or burnt espresso that tastes like your mouth is filled with cigarette butts. And I'm not interested in super-acidic, sour espresso that seemingly comes from using light-roasted beans (even if I prefer a light roast for a pour-over). I'll usually drink a straight single shot, although a cappuccino in the morning might be nice at times. My wife, however, will always have a milky drink. We're not high-volume consumers. Eventually, I'll need to find the right beans and to develop the right technique. But my machine won't need to solve any special problems to extract bright, acidic, floral ""third wave"" flavors from the coffee. It will need to steam milk conveniently and efficiently, though.

If all I wanted to do was pull a shot of espresso, the single boiler option would be appropriate. There are better and worse models, and ones that use PID to manage temperatures. But there doesn't seem any good reason why I can't pull a great espresso with a simple machine as long as I understand its idiosyncrasies. Managing milk becomes a problem, though. Underpowered steamers seem common, and delays waiting for temperatures to adjust generate frustration, especially when making more than one drink at a time.

HX machines deal with the two jobs more effectively, but PID control of brewing temperatures are unlikely to be as effective as in the single boiler application. And many of the HX machines have inordinately long warm-up times.

A double boiler system seems the natural solution: ample steam power, PID control of both boilers is possible, heat up times needn't be crazy. But suddenly we're talking about a $2000+ machine.

I'm not someone who wants to spend years changing machines, experimenting, looking for marginal improvements. A lot of people enjoy that ""hobby"" side of things. I don't. I am happy to work hard to make whatever I buy work well. I'd like to buy a solution that I can simply get to work well; one that doesn't present the sort of functional frustrations that result in the machine sitting unused on the counter. But I'm also not made of money.

Part of me thinks the smart thing to do is to buy the cheap, Chinese option (Miicoffee Apex/ Turin Legato) with no expectation that it lasts more than 3 years. It gives PID control of brew temperature, a thermoblock to help with steam heat and an opportunity to learn what actually matters to me before I make a more permanent decision. But it also seems wasteful - when something fails, it's not going to be repaired, and the machine will end up in the landfill.

1hp309f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hp309f,I stopped by the factory today,"I had to travel to Normal, Illinois, today, which let me check the Rivian factory visit off my list. All of the visitor facilities were closed, maybe because it's Sunday but also maybe because it's the last week of December. But I still went in the main entrance, talk to the security folks, and looked around as much as I could. They asked me not to take any pictures inside, so I didn't.

When you go in the main entrance, the first level has a gear shop and a coffee shop. Again, both were closed. But there's also a huge window into the factory. They let me go up the stairs in the main lobby, and looking through the big window you can see part of the assembly line. There were trucks on a line suspended above the main floor, and it looked like where they were adding doors. The line was not operating while I was there, but there were doors and vehicles on the assembly equipment. The most interesting part about this was  how the assembly equipment is about 20 to 30 ft above the factory floor.

In the opposite direction, there were banks of hundreds of workstations. These were all empty too. The computer area looked very nice and there were high viz vests on some of the desks, so I'm assuming at least some of those people have to go out onto the factory floor sometimes.

While leaving the plant, I drove past many many acres of completed vehicles. The compound is quite huge, so I'm not surprised they decided to construct an R2 line there.

Anywho, if you're ever taking i-55 through Illinois, it's worth at least taking 10 minutes to go see the factory. And just FYI, I currently drive a Model 3, but I have a reservation for the R2.",60,1735498839.0,Rivian,6,0.97,False
1hp301b,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hp301b/confused_about_medication_dose_increase/,Confused about medication dose increase ,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been lurking this sub for a while and it‚Äôs helped me immensely, now I‚Äôm just looking for some advice about medication. 

I‚Äôm 25 years old and I was diagnosed with ADHD (along with depression and a few other things) when I was 23. I always did well in school and have a high performing career so everything got shoved under the rug until I crashed out really hard and had to pursue a diagnosis. 

They started me off on 20mg of vyvanse which felt way too strong for my nervous system so they dropped me down to 10mg which worked really well. I was on 10mg for almost 8-10 months, then went up to 20mg for a few months, and I‚Äôve been on 30mg since June of this year. 

Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling really irritable, sluggish, unable to get out of bed/get work done, everything feels like it requires all of my mental and physical energy (except for working out which is generally something I really like to do). The past week I have felt so burnt out, exhausted, and set off by the littlest things. 

I believe I do have PMDD (although I‚Äôve never been diagnosed) and these symptoms do increase around my period, and I‚Äôm PMS‚Äôing right now so that could be part of it. But this month feels much worse than the others and I‚Äôve been considering whether maybe it‚Äôs time for a medication increase. 

I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the right thing to do so I just wanted to get some insights. I also do eat fairly healthy (with a bit of a sweet tooth), have one coffee a day, and workout 2-3x a week. If anyone else has any other advice I‚Äôd love to hear it. I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way and the angry feelings Im harbouring don‚Äôt do anyone any good and I‚Äôm exhausted 24/7.

1hp301a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hp301a/am_i_f30s_just_a_bandaid_to_him_m30s/,Am I [F30's] just a bandaid to him [M30's]? ,"So thing is, when I met him at the gym and had a little spark between us, I was sure this handsome dude in his 30s is for sure already locked down with a wife and kids. Well, he does have kids, two in fact with a huge age gap.

First is fourteen, and second is four. Mom of first is a drug addict, hasn't been in the picture for a long time. Second child is with his ex-fianc√©, who currently still lives in their shared home with him. Breakup happened 6 months ago, and we've been dating for 4 months. 

Everything started great. We began flirting at the gym, had lots of fun laughing and sharing our common interests. He was open about having kids, I was very open to dating a guy who had kids since we're both in our 30's and more and more people around me already have their own. He was also upfront about still living with his ex, since they had bought a home together and selling it was a slow process. Seemed to be over the relationship with her and in general excited to be out of it, especially because she hinted at her being very bossy and demeaning to him. And he wasn't kidding. Every time his phone rang he seemed to tense up, and become small and docile, which was a complete opposite of what he had been just a moment before. 

I decided that I'd keep things a little cool between us until he would be fully moved out, but what do you expect from a single gal that's high on pheromones at the gym? One weekend when his kids and ex were apparently away, we went drinking to a local bar and had an absolute blast, singing karaoke and laughing over anything and everything. While we were waiting for the taxis home, I dropped the ball and kissed him. Hence forth things began to escalate. 

Not soon after, I suggested we get coffee at my place after the gym. He was slightly hesitant, because he told me he had to be home soonishly, but he eventually agreed to come over for a bit. While we were talking and cuddling, his ex called, he picked up immediately and then proceeded to lie about his whereabouts. Which I felt extremely odd about, considering he told me they had already broken up. I guess he noticed the surprise on my face, and proceeded to just say he didn't want to have ""that convo"" on the phone. Whatever that meant. 

In a few weeks time, it became a routine thay 2-3 times a week he'd pop by after gym for a coffee. And every time she'd call about something menial, he'd lie about his whereabouts. I began to feel really bad, especially because I was so excited about him and had told all my friends and family about what a wonderful man I had met, but he had kept on keeping me a secret from everyone, especially his ex. I felt like a mistress, even though we were not cheating on anyone. I ended up pushing him about it once, and he shared that when they broke up, she had requested him to not get into anything until they would be fully separated. He had agreed to those terms, but told me that meeting me was so unexpected and fast, and that he really couldn't handle her freaking out on him especially since they'd still be figuring out co-parenting dynamics in the future when he has his own place. 

I told him I understood, logically I did - but as it kept on happening I somehow began to feel like a mistress of a married family man. Also, the rare few times we were out for food or coffee, he'd sit us as far away from the streetside windows as possible, presumably to avoid anyone his ex knows from seeing us. 

A detail I also found strange was that when he mentioned that his toddler had climbed into their bed in the night after having nightmares, I asked why he would still be sharing a bed with his ex - and he replied that because he's so tall (he really is a tower), he couldn't fit onto the sofa and therefore just accepted that this was the living situation until he got his own flat for himself and the teenager. I thought somehow it was valid of him to say especially because he works a physically demanding job in construction, but was somehow so puzzled why his ex wouldn't have opted for the sofa especially since she'd been the one to initiate the breakup. On one occasion we also talked about cheating, and he was very clear about it being a one and done type thing for him, so I somehow thought that with this attitude they would not be intimate, and I never got that feeling. Still, strange. 

And as you'd expect, things between us kept escalating. One very cuddly evening when we'd both skipped gym to spend time together I caved in, and had sex with him - something I was pushing not to do until he'd have his own place.

I guess it was because 2,5 months in he'd been so open about his feelings, and told me he loved me. Then onwards I felt like my feelings also began flooding in despite my hesitation especially to consider him being a parent and wanting to get to know him properly. Oxytocin definitely deepend that bond. 

I think there was a point where he just began to feel more guilt than love, and after he'd found a new flat for them (him and his teenager to live in), he got really distant with me. It's like his while world was falling apart. Every time we'd meet up he was so tuned out, absent and constantly thinking about how he'd yet again become a single parent. Which to me felt really tone-deaf since he never included me into his picture. Or he would, in some clutch save when he'd mention right after how he couldn't wait to live together with me. It's like our whole dating period was just skipped to this weird affair, and instead of thinking about how much freedom he could have finally spending time together with me, he was only focused on the loss of his ""family"", when the breakup itself had happened at that point already half a year ago. He did mention at one point to me that they had great family routines and ways to deal with things that he will miss, and that he didn't realize it would hit him so hard. I just really don't understand why those things didn't hit him earlier? Why only after he was seriously moving out of their shared home? 

I felt like I was never supposed to be in this position. Watching a man I love have to grieve losing his family? It became especially hurtful to me because this was never an affair. He made the feelings of his seemingly-terrible ex fiance more important than mine, only because they share a child together. The secrecy made me feel like he was never proud to be with me, or that he doesn't appreciate me. Even when he told me those nice things unprompted in the beginning. As this continued, my feelings began to faulter and dissipate. 

I told him eventually about how I was feeling, and especially about me feeling left out, since even though we saw eachother for a few hours 2-3 times a week, I never dared to text or call him out of fear of him getting into trouble. He expressed regret about the whole thing, and told me he was sorry that it went this way, and that he wishes he could be the best man for me and that at the moment he wasn't capable. I felt like there was no conclusion to that conversation. We simply began to meet less often, my feelings became more tense and anxious around him - I felt like he'd just put me on a shelf until x period when he'd be fully ""ready"" to date me. Even the lack of communicating with me properly about how he was feeling and what was going on in his mind and heart somehow just made me feel so resentful towards him. I even began to wonder if the reason his ex was like that to him was because of his inability to be direct and communicative. He just seemed in general to be so aloof but simultaneously like such a ball of stress that would shut down at the first sign of difficulty. It's like he couldn't handle stress at all, which could have to do with raising a child to 9 years old completely on his own. But still. Why drag me on like this? Why haven't my feelings been important to him at all? 

I can almost feel how his feelings shifted away, and I feel like the man I know he could be isn't who he is at this moment. He's moving out of his flat in two months, and even then, figuring out the new co-parenting with an ex who seems controlling and demeaning probably isn't the best situation to be dating in. 

But I do really care for him, deeply even. I'm just so insanely confused how a man who told me he loves me could not wish to spend every waking moment with me, texting nonstop and getting to know everything about me? At least until the honeymoon period wears off? Is it because he has children that the shift in responsibilities makes him less emotionally available? Is it because he may not be as over his ex or their shared dynamic? Please help me understand if my expectations of him are completely unrealistic, as I have zero idea about parenting responsibilities. I'm feeling just so lost and confused. 


TL;DR:

Man I've been dating for 4 months has kept me a secret from his ex-fianc√© because he promised he wouldn't move on until they fully separated. They still share a house and have two children in the mix. Even though she initiated the breakup well over 6 months ago, he's been hiding me out of courtesy to her for four months now. I feel like I've completely missed out on a blossoming honeymoon phase and I'm left on emotional standby until he is ready to date me (which has no clear date at the moment). I feel like I was lead to believe he was more over the relationship until he'd found a new apartment, and is now somehow grieving the loss of his family while I'm left not being emotionally cared for at all between his parental duties and delegating the separation. He told me he loved me but I feel more like I'm a convenience for his future instead of actually being invested in getting to know me and loving on me consistently. Help me understand this whole situation and if my expectations are completely unrealistic considering his situation? ",2,1735498825.0,relationships,9,0.75,False

Now thoroughly confused, I look on this subreddit for information and see that Breville and De'Longhi BOTH make their own versions of the Vertuo Plus Deluxe?

 just want to make sure that they sent me the Deluxe because read that it has a few more features and better build quality. If anyone can help me confirm this that would be great. Thanks!",1,1735498770.0,NespressoVertuo,0,1.0,False
1hp2z1m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hp2z1m,Case for Speed Editor?,"I saw an archived post on this earlier, but I'm curious what everyone uses to carry their speed editors. I looked around quite a bit on Amazon, expecting to find at least some kind of hermit shell or other semi-soft or hard shell designed specifically for this, you'd think the Chinese aftermarket industry would try to capitalize on something like this, but maybe it's a bit niche.

Anyway, I finally bit the bullet and bought a case from Nanuk, specifically the 909 model. I already have the 910 model for my condenser mic and shock mount, and I'm pretty happy with these cases. So I went with the one that seemed most likely to fit the speed editor.

Now, of course I'm super happy with the Nanuk but it is a little bulky for everyday carrying like when I go to and from my home office to coffee shops and what not. The ideal grab and go case I can think of would be a neoprene sleeve or something similar that's really low profile.

Anyhow, curious what other people are using. Share pics!",7,1735498751.0,davinciresolve,8,1.0,False
1hp2yz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianadultstory/comments/1hp2yz1/susie_the_widow_fucked/,"Susie, the Widow fucked","**About 20 years ago, a couple moved into the house across the street from my wife and I. Ol‚Äô Henry Carter did himself right with his new bride, as Susan (Susie to her friends) was at least 15 years younger than Henry, was a former beauty queen, and took care of herself with a gym membership, personal trainer, and vegetarian diet. At the time, Susie was somewhere around 40, and Henry was in his late 50s. My wife and I were around 30.**

**Over the years we got to know the Carters quite well, and I enjoyed Susie‚Äôs bright personality and slightly dirty sense of humor. She also hinted at some of Henry‚Äôs capabilities in the bedroom, and I guess she might have married him for more than just money.**

**About five years ago Henry was diagnosed with skin cancer, and he and Susie spent a long few years battling the disease until it killed him earlier this year.**

**After Henry died, Susie remained in the house, and after my wife left me a couple years ago she seemed to become a bit friendlier to me. At times, she would bake things for me, bring me coffee from the local coffee stand, etc., all because she was ‚Äúworried about me.‚Äù**

**I saw Susie at least three times a week, taking a walk or watering the roses, and once in awhile even used her nice home gym when I didn‚Äôt feel like driving to my normal gym. On this particular day she was in the gym at the same time I was, and we chatted as we went through our workouts. Let me tell you, for a woman that recently turned 60, she looked great ‚Äì she still ate a vegetarian diet, spent a couple hours a day in the gym or doing yoga, had a personal trainer, and about 10 years ago had her breasts lifted. And because she told us, I knew they were a 34 C.**

**After we were done, Susie asked me if I‚Äôd like to come in for a shoulder rub and glass of iced green tea. This was bold, but not out of character for Susie. As this was unfolding I did not know what level of sexual activity she had been involved with lately, but do know she had gone five years without intimacy while Henry was sick. And as a highly sexual person I knew this was hard for her.**

**After a few minutes of massaging my shoulders she commented on how tight I was and told me to stretch out on one of her yoga mats and take off my t-shirt. She attacked my back with enthusiasm, moved down to my legs, and then told me to flip over. Susie is not a shy person and she is very comfortable with her body and with others, so she had no trouble massaging my chest and quads, and did not seem to be bothered by the few times she brushed my balls or penis. However, her actions were having an effect on me, and there was nothing I could do to hide the growing bulge in my shorts. Now that it was obvious, I opened my eyes and looked at Susie, she leaned down, and we locked lips.**

**From this point, it was on. We were two unattached adults, and after the ‚Äúdead bedroom‚Äù period of my marriage, I was open for adventure. So after just a minute of wild French kissing, Susie grabbed my shorts and pulled them and my compression pants down and off. So even though my fully engorged cock was out and waiting, I stopped her, sat up, and took her tank top and sports bra off. Boy, her plastic surgeon did a good job, her tits were still firm, pale skin with small, light pink aureolas and nipples. Reactively, I grabbed her boobs with both hands, squeezed them and kissed and sucked both nipples, and we were both kind of blinded with lust.**

**Susie had a goal though, and she broke away and pushed me back down. Immediately she was down to my crotch, licking from base to head, then taking my whole length in her mouth. Her hunger and experience surprised me, and I was in absolute heaven. As good as this felt, I knew I had some stamina that day, so I could lay back and enjoy without fear of coming yet.**

**After a couple minutes of giving me head, Susie stood up, walked over to a sofa and sat down. I followed, knelt down between her legs, and spent the next 10 minutes using my fingers and tongue building her up to a couch soaking, head squeezing orgasm. After giving her a few minutes to recover, I positioned myself with my tool nestled in her labia, and slowly started working it in. Susie was surprisingly tight, and I immediately felt her pelvic muscle squeezing my cock. I fucked her like this for a few minutes, loving the sight of her round breasts shaking around, and felt myself getting close. To stop the action for a minute I helped her off the couch in to a kneeling position, and then entered her from behind. I slowed it down a bit at this point and just took in the sight of my very wet cock sliding in and out of my beautiful, mature neighbor‚Äôs pussy.**

**Since I had a vasectomy a number of years back, and Susie knew it, as we both approached climax, I buried my dick as deep as I could, like I was sheathing a sword in a stone, and exploded with a groan inside her. Then we collapsed on the the couch, sweating and glowing from the mutual orgasms.**

**Later that day after a few chores and a shower, I was rock hard again for some reason. So, I grabbed a tube of body lotion, laid back on my bed, and relived the moment, knowing there would be more to come.**",1,1735498745.0,indianadultstory,0,1.0,False

Recently, I saw a video where a young boy named Shine Obiblo sang a song entitled ‚ÄúAbove All.‚Äù¬† When he came to the part where ‚ÄúJesus lived and died rejected,‚Äù he began to cry. ¬†Tears flowed down his cheeks as he sang about Jesus as the ‚ÄúRose that was trampled on the ground.‚Äù ¬†This little boy understood more about Jesus‚Äô love and sacrifice than many adults.¬† When was the last time we sang or talked with an emotional display of reverence at the name of Jesus?

Celebration worship is an outward display of the physical and emotional actions of Christians.¬† It is important that in this type of worship, God‚Äôs holiness is never lost sight of in the hearts and minds of the worshipers.¬† Worship is not a secular event where we entertain our carnal feelings but an awakening of the ‚Äúspirit man.‚Äù

David the Psalmist tells us to, ‚ÄúEnter into His gates with thanksgiving.‚Äù (Psalm 100:4)¬† Normally when we arrive for Sunday worship we are more concerned with meeting and greeting our friends than preparing to worship.¬† We laugh and share stories of our weekly adventures with coffee in one hand and a donut in the other.¬† Where is the preparation for honoring and worshiping the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords? ¬†Moving from the ‚Äúgates‚Äù (entrance) of our Assembly we progress into the ‚Äúcourts‚Äù (sanctuary) with praise and adoration.¬† Praise brings us into the presence of the Lord and worship is what we do when we get there.

The holiness of God is to be respected and honored when it comes to worship.¬† When we stand before our living Lord and Savior we are participating in a holy atmosphere where we cry out ‚ÄúHoly, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty.‚Äù (Revelation 4:8)¬† Our worship should never attempt to bring God down to our level; rather, we are to elevate our eyes and words from the carnal to His divine presence.

When one sees the summation of Jesus‚Äôs life in Philippians 2:4-11, the reader cannot help being overcome with expressions of gratitude and love.¬† When we speak His name casually and generally, we lack reference. ¬†If we are worthy of Jesus dying for us should He not be worthy of our living for Him?¬† The Scriptures tell us that we should fear the Lord.¬† That means Christians should care about what He thinks and says more than anything else.¬† He is the One that has the power to destroy body and soul, yet we live a casual life void of the reality of treating Him with the reverence that is due Him.

Good morning, pet.

Oh, no need to panic. You can‚Äôt get up. You‚Äôre still tied down by my spells. Sshhh. Sssshhhh. It‚Äôs okay.

Oh, pet! My adorable little baby! I‚Äôve missed you so much! Awwwww! Come here, you.

*(SFX: Rustling of bedsheets)*

Awwww. I missed you so, so, so much! I went out earlier into the forest to gather some herbs while you were sleeping. And I just couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about you. My precious pet, tucked away under my blankets on my bed. Dreaming of me.

You dreamt of me, didn‚Äôt you? I was in your dreams, holding you close to me. Just like this.

Ssshhh. I know. I know, baby. I don‚Äôt want us to be apart even when you‚Äôre sleeping and I...(rueful) and I have to let you out of my arms to do my work. But only for a little while. Only a little! I-I always come back to you, don‚Äôt I?

Yes. I‚Äôll always come back to you. I‚Äôll never let you be lonely. Never again. I love you.

(Giggling, sweet at first, gradually turning unhinged) I...I love you. I do....I....I love you, my darling! I love you so much! Mmmmmnnnn! I love you. (Kissing him). Oh, I do. Yes, I do! Yes, I do, sweet baby! I love you so much! I love you, I love you, I...I...(whisper) I love you. (Giggling- borderline scary)

(Deathly calm) And don‚Äôt you forget it. Ever.

(As if stating a cold fact) You belong to me.

(Softer, all of a sudden) You...you always have, my sweet little boy. I‚Äôm sorry I took so long to find you, but now- now you‚Äôre finally home! Home, in my arms, nuzzling into me. My adorable pet.

Wrap your arms around me, pet. Put them around my waist.

(Sighing blissfully) Good boy. How I‚Äôve missed this...

I know my magic compels you to wrap your arms around me whenever I ask you to. But, I like to think that...maybe, even if you weren‚Äôt under my spell, you‚Äôd still do this on your own if I...if I asked you. You know?

(A little giggle) A girl‚Äôs allowed to dream, isn‚Äôt she?

Oh, but where are my manners? You must be hungry, darling.

No? (More giggling) Silly thing. But it‚Äôs your favourite! And the coffee is just as you like it. Isn‚Äôt that right, Ruby?

Awww. Look at her nodding her head. Do you see that, darling? Ruby made you coffee. And she brought us breakfast in bed. Isn‚Äôt she absolutely lovely?

Darling?

Come, now. I know you‚Äôre still a little scared of her. I mean, she is a doll. A living doll. You‚Äôre probably not used to dolls walking on their own, and smiling when they see you, and blinking their eyes as they stare at you. As they...watch over you while you sleep, to keep you safe for me.

You‚Äôre...you‚Äôre probably not used to that. But there‚Äôs nothing to be scared of! I promise. Ruby is my friend. Do you know why I named her that?

It‚Äôs because her eyes are the loveliest shade of red I‚Äôve ever seen. Just like rubies! Aren‚Äôt her eyes simply adorable?

Darling, there‚Äôs nothing to be scared of. Ruby is my friend. And she loves you like you‚Äôre her baby brother. All my dolls do.

Don‚Äôt you see how she‚Äôs smiling at you? You *are* going to drink the coffee, yes?

Pet? What‚Äôs wrong? Are you...are you not in the mood for coffee right now?

Oh. I see. Well, it‚Äôs alright. We can have coffee and breakfast a little later then.

Ruby, no! He- he didn‚Äôt mean it like that. Please don‚Äôt be sad. My darling loves your coffee. It‚Äôs just a little too early in the morning for him. That‚Äôs all. Isn‚Äôt that right, darling?

(Sighing softly) Thank you, sweetie. Dolls get attached very quickly, you see. So you have to be really careful not to hurt their feelings. See how she‚Äôs smiling again?

It‚Äôs okay, baby. We can just cuddle for now. It‚Äôs okay. Sshhh. I‚Äôve got you. I‚Äôve got you.

Hm? Ruby, do you have something to ask?

(Giggling) Of course, you can go play with Emerald and Sapphire and all the other dolls! Don‚Äôt let us keep you. Just set the tray down on the bedside table.

Thank you, Ruby. I‚Äôll call for you later when I need help brewing potions.

*(SFX: Soft thumping sounds/footsteps, as the doll walks away)*

Darling? Is something the matter?

Of course I can understand what she says! I explained it to you in detail earlier, but you just fell asleep on my lap, didn‚Äôt you? (Sighing fondly) What a cute, forgetful little pet I have.

But in any case, my dolls don‚Äôt need to have a voice in order to speak. Don‚Äôt worry, love. (Whispering) Soon you‚Äôll be able to hear them too.

I had only these dolls for company before I claimed you as mine. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, they really are the most wonderful friends anybody could ever ask for. But I...I did still get so terribly lonely at times.

I‚Äôm so happy I found you.

Nuzzle a bit closer to me, pet. Let me hold you properly.

Mmnnn. Thank you, sweetness.

You know, sometimes I wish you were always like this. Unable to move or leave my bed without my permission. Held by my spells. I mean, it‚Äôs really not difficult to make that happen. (Whispering) There are so, so many ways I could bewitch you. (Giggling)

I could cast a spell on you whenever you breathe in my scent. My perfume. You do seem to love it so much.

Or...I could do it whenever you listen to my voice. Make you all docile, and obedient, and so very adorably subby. (Whispering) Especially when I lean in so close that my hair tickles your face, and I just...whisper into your ears. (Kiss) And leave soft little kisses. (Kiss)

Or...I could simply put you under whenever you look into my eyes. This one is actually my favourite. I adore how you‚Äôre so shy about making eye contact, but then, once you look into my eyes- you‚Äôre simply unable to focus on anything else.

Beautiful, aren‚Äôt they?

I wasn‚Äôt talking about my eyes. (Giggling)

Oh, you‚Äôre so amusing, my darling! Of all the places you could have stared at to avoid being hypnotized by my eyes, you chose to....(content sigh) naughty pet. Very naughty. Whatever am I going to do with you?

I suppose I could try a few fun potions on you. Remember the one that turned you into a cat?

(Baby voice) Awwwww! Don‚Äôt look at me like that, baby. You loved it when I cuddled you on my lap, and gave you head pats and ear scritches. Lots and lots of headpats and scritches!

Besides, you knew I‚Äôd turn you back eventually. Right?

Of course I would. As cute as you may be when you‚Äôre a cat...I think I still prefer you this way.

(Adoring) You really have such a pretty face. Pretty boy. (Kissing him)

But you always get me so distracted. I was saying- I could just keep you like this. Unable to get up and move around and accidentally stub your toe. Or...or run away.

The paralysis spell is like being under a big, warm, comfy blanket, is it not? It‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of, darling. Whenever I cast a spell on you, it‚Äôs like...it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm sharing a part of myself with you.

Yes. I like the thought of that. This way, you‚Äôll always have a part of me with you. All the time. You don‚Äôt...you don‚Äôt really need to move around on your own, do you?

I...I like the thought of you needing me for everything...of being the centre of your universe.

(Pouting) No? Why not?

Because I‚Äôm already the centre of your uni- oh, darling! Awwww. You‚Äôre so sweet.

(Kissing him) You‚Äôre the sweetest. You really are. But you‚Äôre not just saying that to get me to loosen your magical restraints, are you?

Hm. I don‚Äôt know. Prove it to me.

(Sighing) Stroke my hair.

Yeah. I‚Äôm just going to lie on top of you like this. With my ear pressed against your chest, so I can listen to your heartbeat. And I want you to brush my hair. I...I‚Äôm not going to compel you. But I‚Äôd really like it if you...if you run your fingers through my hair. It...(sighing happily) it always makes me feel so nice.

Thank you, pet. Keep your other hand wrapped around my waist. (Soft) Hold me closer.

(Softly sighing again) I‚Äôm so happy I found you. I...I‚Äôd been watching you for quite some time, you know? What your life was like in the village beyond this forest. How soft, and kind you were. And how people always ended up hurting you, in spite of that. (Soft) Maybe because of that.

You kept trying to smile and put on a brave face and carry on with your work, despite what you really felt like underneath. And I...I wanted to free you from that vicious cycle. But I was a little selfish too, I must admit.

Witches are solitary creatures. We live by ourselves, deep inside the forest, cut off from the rest of the world. Surrounded by tomes and spells and- and what familiars we conjure to help with the loneliness. Like my dear little dolls. But waking up alone in your bed everyday, with no one to nuzzle into or to pull up the blankets for me when I‚Äôm cold, it...it‚Äôs such a lonely way to live.

After a point, eventually, a witch ventures out from the forest in the dark, quiet, witching hours of the night, and...she claims a mate.

Someone to call her own.

I still blush a bit sometimes, when I see my sigil engraved around your neck. That symbol is unique to me. Anybody who sees it will know that you belong to me.

It looks just like a collar, you know? But it‚Äôs magically etched into your skin. It‚Äôs permanent. I kind of like that, because this is a collar you can‚Äôt take off. (Giggling a bit)

(Very softly) And it‚Äôs one I‚Äôll *never* take off.

I know I didn‚Äôt give you much of a choice when I made you my pet. But I really did think you‚Äôd be so much happier with me.

(A little vulnerable) You are happy with me, aren‚Äôt you?

Really? It‚Äôs hard to protest when you‚Äôre brushing my hair like this...(sighing)...but you‚Äôre not just saying that to make me happy, right?

Thanks.

You really are sweet.

Mhmn. We can stay like this a little longer. But we- we eventually do need to get up and have breakfast. And you need to drink your coffee. Or else Ruby will be sad. You know how she gets when she‚Äôs sad.

(Giggling, playful) Hey! I didn‚Äôt say we need to get up *right now.* Don‚Äôt you dare try to get up.

Just‚Ä¶just keep stroking my hair.

Good boy.

(Sighing) Hey. I was just thinking...would you like to accompany me on a walk through the woods later?

Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll keep you safe. I just want to...to show you more of my home, if you like.

Yes?

(Teasing) What a good boy you are! Thanks, baby.

You mean so much to me.

(Softly, obsessively) Good boy. I love you...I just love you so much...I love you...love, love, love, love, love you...my pet...so adorable...such a good boy for me...so cute...I just can‚Äôt take it, I- (giggling)

(Whispering) I love you...I love you so much...(giggling- just a little unhinged).

1hp2s9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hp2s9i/people_who_got_rejected_did_i_trauma_dump_without/,"People who got rejected, did I trauma dump without knowing it ?","I'm a 22-year-old man and I met a girl my age at the beginning of the year with whom I'm costiagiary at the hospital (I'm a medical student). I immediately saw that she liked me, but I wanted to take my time after being out of a year-and-a-half relationship. We're getting to know each other in a professional setting in the mornings, but I make her laugh, take coffee breaks with her, and so on. This thing went during 2 months and I asked her to go to work with me at the library one Sunday and we spent the hole day together. Within a few weeks, things got really exciting and we kissed at a party. We had our first date the next day which went really well and we kissed again.

I'm a reserved kind of person when it comes to dating and I try my best to keep calm and distance so I don't get too involved at first (defense mechanism from previous relationships). The following week we continued to see each other at work placements and a mutual friend informed me that she ‚Äúreally liked me‚Äù without me asking for any information and that she (my date) wanted to know if I did too. I asked her out on another date, which went very well again, and we kissed a third time at the end of it, she was laughing nervously and excitedly which was very sweet.

Finally, the following week I changed internships and went into oncology, which is pretty tough mentally for a 4th year student. My little sister, whom I adore, also taught me that she was bulimic and that she scarified herself. I've kept this to myself all week, she doesn't want me to tell my parents. Monday and Tuesday go by, and I get a message from this girl asking me when I'm coming back to work with her at the library. I reply that I'll be back at the end of the week. The days I come are going extremely well, she wants to do all her breaks with me and I'm starting to see that she's becoming attached, maybe more than I thought and it's almost starting to make me develop budding emotions

She's already told me about her family and some of her stories, some of which are quite shocking (bullying at school, fighting with her little brother when she was a child with knifes), but which she tells me in a joking tone, as she's quite anxious which I take without any worries.

I receive a message from my sister on Thursday morning, explaining that my parents have spotted her cigarette pack and that she would like me to cover it up and tell the story to my date in jest. We laugh about it all day, and in the evening she sends me a message to find out how the evening went with my sister and my parents.I very rarely open up to people, and that's exactly what my ex, whom I left, criticized me for. The subject didn't concern me directly and the potential interest for my little sister led me to ask her opinion after some hesitation. Not really at ease, I decide to tell her that it's actually more serious than what I thought and that my sister is suffering from psychological problems. I explain the situation to her and ask her for advice as she is also a girl and a med student (should I tell my parents? has she ever had friends who did this?) She answers me kindly and the next day we talked about it, but I felt that it was a sensitive subject so I didn't force the issue. ¬†

She continues to send me messages in the afternoon, I make her laugh again and everything goes well. On Saturday we have an evening together and I feel she's more distant than usual, but don't make it personal. Some of her close friends even come up to me and tease me that I'm going to end up in a relationship with the girl, but I laugh it off without making a fuss.

Sunday and Monday go by and I decide to ask this girl out again.¬†

I receive a long message in which she explains that she's no longer in the mood to continue and that she's sorry she's been so distant lately. I reply that I appreciate her honesty and that there are no problems, but ask if I might have frightened her or done something in particular that she wouldn't have liked? She replies that not at all, that she's just had a fright all on her own this weekend and that it's nothing to do with me. We haven't spoken in 4 weeks, but I know I'm going to see her again for our exams in 1 months and a half.

She had never had a long or serious relationship, and some people had warned me about her ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù character, her best friend even advising me to ‚Äúnot give a damn about her‚Äù if I wanted to ‚Äúhave her‚Äù.¬†

Personally, my love affairs have always helped me to improve, even when they didn't lead to anything. I've taken up the gym, BJJ, philosophy and medicine, and my life has only gotten better. The problem here is that I don't know what lesson to draw from it. Was she the problem? Was it me? Was it both of us? What could I have done differently or should I avoid in a future relationship?

I don't want to chase after her and I imagine that if she hasn't sent me anything it's because she simply doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

Dads, I‚Äôm a long time lurker in here but haven‚Äôt had the need to post much since joining. I mostly just enjoy other‚Äôs stories and benefit from advice shared in this sub 

I may be at my breaking point with my 6 year old son. I‚Äôm trying not to be and I think that I‚Äôve always handled things calmly which has led to me getting a 2 time ‚Äòfather of the year‚Äô award coffee mug at Christmas but I‚Äôm starting to have a hard time distinguishing between being ‚Äòjust a boy‚Äô and ‚Äòuncomfortably wild‚Äô in my son.

He‚Äôs always been shy and reserved around people he doesn‚Äôt know and full of energy around people that he does. Here lately, however, his normal bountiful supply of energy has been kicked up into overdrive into what I would consider an ‚Äòin your face, you have become my playpin‚Äô kind of behavior. 

I had convinced myself that it was normal behavior for boys in his age group until I sat back and observed him interacting with some of his peers in the neighborhood. It was then that I became self-aware that ‚Äòshit‚Ä¶my son is ‚Äòthat‚Äô kid‚Ä¶‚Äô 

I tried to sit him down and have a serious discussion about controlling your impulses around other kids and adults that may not be familiar with his particular style of playing but but not much was heard because he was turning into a Rollie-Pollie and tumbling down my lap and across the couch about 4 seconds in 

I think part of the problem is that he looks bigger and older than he is, something I dealt with too, so whereas he can easily fit in with boys who are 8 or 9 years old I have to constantly remind myself that he isn‚Äôt 8 or 9. By the same token, he isn‚Äôt 4 anymore either so when he bounces out this last bit of toddler left in him it becomes a bit more jarring because he‚Äôs larger and older and isn‚Äôt as cute as when a 4 year old is giving their parents hell in the grocery store 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking/venting about is: how do I reframe the way I see his behavior so I can savor the last little bit of innocent toddler he has left in him while not letting him lose complete control and be unstoppable once he is 8 or 9? ",3,1735498229.0,daddit,2,0.8,False

I (24F) have a male coworker (29M) who just joined our company and is on probation for 6 months (standard for all new joiners.) I could kind of guess he felt some kind of attraction towards me, but we‚Äôd never spoken much and I never thought of him in that way‚Ä¶ until our office xmas party. 

We were all quite drunk, it was at a club, and he started calling me adorable, we were chatting and at the end of the night, he asked me if I wanted to get a drink back at his place. 

Long story short, we made out (nothing more than that) and he told me he liked me ever since the second time we spoke in the office (he remembered what I had told him and parroted it back to me) and wanted to take me out on a date. 

I was surprised and asked him why he‚Äôd never spoken much to me before and he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù, which I did not know what to make of. 

Asked for my number and in the end, I said no we shouldn‚Äôt, let‚Äôs stay colleagues because I didn‚Äôt want it getting messy; I‚Äôm a junior and he‚Äôs a senior + on probation. 

The next day I have regrets and message him. We wind up meeting for coffee (his suggestion) and it feels like a date‚Ä¶ except he tells me he‚Äôs thought it over and feels it‚Äôs too risky for him because he‚Äôs on probation and has just moved here. 

He also backtracked on saying he liked me and said he was attracted (which I‚Äôm reading as different from liking someone). I say okay and we agree to be friends. 

But he flirts with me over text sometimes, and then the other night he texted me when he was drunk asking me why I haven‚Äôt come to work recently (I was sick) and asking me if I was alright, saying he thinks I‚Äôm super sweet etc. Asks for my instagram. Finally he says he‚Äôll send me skiing pics when he goes skiing‚Ä¶ and then just never does. 

Is he just playing a giant game and I‚Äôm not seeing through it? Is this just a lust thing or could there be genuine feelings there? I‚Äôm just confused and would really like a male perspective.

There is a standard of care in the icu, because of our ratios & acuity, that is expected as the bare minimum- ie charting q1 vital signs, verifying I&O‚Äôs hourly (especially drips and foley op). 

I have been charging for a few months and have been so shocked at how UNCOMMON it is for those things to be done, especially in really sick patients. It is one thing if you‚Äôre so busy that charting comes second to patient care, but I‚Äôm talking not even a vital sign or urine output will be charted for 6-8 hours of the shift and this is on a true icu patient, while the nurse sits at the desk and plays on their phone. Or I will notice a patient is getting sicker and I walk into the room and they just look worse than what I got in charge report so I make them a 1:1 and advocate for that extra staff to make that happen and then as soon as I have it as a 1:1, the nurse passes meds and then the nurse sees it as an easy shift with a load of free time to read a book, get multiple coffees, and hang out with their friends‚Ä¶.

1hp2lrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dentalmaterials/comments/1hp2lrw/looking_for_a_good_electricteeth_cleaner/,Looking for a Good ElectricTeeth Cleaner?,"Hey Reddit! üëã

Let‚Äôs talk about upgrading your dental care routine. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to step up your oral hygiene without spending a fortune on professional cleanings, it might be time to look into an **electric teeth cleaner**. 

Specifically, the [**AquaSonic Black Series Ultra Whitening Toothbrush**](https://geni.us/gXPTfZT), a device that‚Äôs not just a toothbrush‚Äîit‚Äôs an all-in-one solution for cleaner, healthier teeth.

## What Is an Electric Teeth Cleaner, and Why Should You Care? ü¶∑‚ú®

An electric teeth cleaner is more than a basic toothbrush. It‚Äôs designed to give you a deeper clean by using advanced technology to remove plaque, prevent tartar build-up, and even tackle surface stains. Think of it as the high-tech cousin of your old manual toothbrush‚Äîfaster, more effective, and smarter.

The AquaSonic Black Series isn‚Äôt just any electric toothbrush. With its **40,000 VPM motor**, multiple brushing modes, and advanced features, it delivers the kind of clean that makes you feel like you‚Äôve just left the dentist‚Äôs office.

## Why I Switched to an Electric Teeth Cleaner üñ§

I‚Äôll admit it: I was skeptical about switching from my trusty manual toothbrush. But after noticing plaque buildup no matter how diligently I brushed, I decided to try something new. Enter the AquaSonic Black Series, which caught my attention because:

* **It‚Äôs ADA Accepted:** The American Dental Association only approves products that actually work.
* **It Does It All:** From deep cleaning to polishing and whitening, this device is built to handle all your oral care needs.
* **8 Brush Heads Included:** That‚Äôs over a year‚Äôs worth of brush heads, making it super budget-friendly.

## My Experience with the AquaSonic Black Series üöÄ

From the first use, I noticed a huge difference. The **40,000 vibrations per minute** feel powerful but gentle‚Äîlike a professional cleaning session at home. Here‚Äôs how it works for me:

1. **Pick Your Mode:** The AquaSonic has 4 modes, including one for deep cleaning and another for polishing.
2. **Let the Smart Timer Guide You:** It buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch sections of your mouth.
3. **Enjoy the Results:** After just one session, my teeth felt noticeably smoother and cleaner.

Within a week, I noticed my smile looked brighter, and my gums felt healthier. Plus, the polish mode gave my teeth a smooth, shiny finish that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.

## What Sets the AquaSonic Apart as an Electric Teeth Cleaner?

* **Advanced Technology:** The 40,000 vibrations per minute effectively break down plaque, even in hard-to-reach areas.
* **Customizable Modes:** Whether you need a gentle clean for sensitive gums or a deeper clean after a big meal, the AquaSonic has a mode for you.
* **Wireless Charging:** The sleek charging dock keeps things convenient and clutter-free.

## Who Should Consider an Electric Teeth Cleaner?

If you‚Äôre wondering whether an electric teeth cleaner is right for you, here are a few signs it might be time to upgrade:

* You‚Äôre dealing with plaque build-up that a manual toothbrush can‚Äôt seem to tackle.
* You want to prevent tartar and keep your teeth cleaner between dentist visits.
* You‚Äôre looking for a more effective way to remove surface stains from coffee, tea, or wine.
* You‚Äôre tired of inconsistent brushing habits and want a device to guide you.

## What I Love About the AquaSonic Black Series

1hp2kh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1hp2kh0/where_to_go_from_here/,Where to go from here?,"I (42M) and my partner (41F) have been dating a bit over a year. We are both divorced, Her's many years ago, mine more recent. I have two kids (6g, 15b), she has none.

Overall, the relationship has been strong. We spend lots of time together, she likes to cook and I enjoy what she makes. We both like to travel and have gone on several trips over the past year. I feel I've learned a lot from my divorce and really make a consistent effort to show up in the relationship, showing my appreciation for her in a variety of ways (making her morning coffee, driving her to her work, flowers, etc.), I also make substantially more than her, own my house, and cover virtually all expenses, including paying for several trips over the past year.  We've lived together for about a half year now. 

Her past is mostly a series of shorter relationships, up to about 1 year. She was cheated on by one guy years ago.   


Mostly things are good between us. She likes to ask why I love her and/or how does she know I won't leave her, or similar things. I know she's looking for re-assurance and I don't mess around with that. I give her straight and consistent re-assurance, ie. ""I think she's beautiful"", ""I'm in love with you, not looking for someone else"" etc. whatever is appropriate in the moment. Surprisingly, when I'm looking for my own re-assurance, she's a bit less consistent about giving it to me. 

She's become a bit of a homebody, doesn't go to the gym or much else during the week at all. which doesn't directly bother me, but does because she complains about how she's gotten out of routines, how she used to be more fun, etc. 

I have my kids every other weekend. She's bonded very well with the younger daughter, and the teenager 99% of the time does his own thing. I think occasionally being a step-parent (or whatever her role currently is) feels a bit constricting for her, but she also does genuinely enjoy my daughter, so it's probably mixed emotions?

A few times she's kind of randomly gotten colder and dressed up to go out with female friend, and the energy is always weird. I feel like she's being almost purposefully secretive, and waiting for me to ask where she is going or who she is going to see, she'll respond like I'm digging in too much or act like she needs permission. I don't feel it's fair at all. I feel it's pretty normal to just share the details up front, and I'm not following up with more questions. Basic conversational stuff, and respect for your partner, I think. ""Hey, I'm going out this afternoon to help Bill on roofing his shed"" or ""I'm going to grab coffee Susan, you want me to pick you up anything?"". Things like that seem normal to me. 

I know that If I did the same thing to her, she would not like it.  

I don't want to pretend I'm perfect, I'm absolutely not, but I was in a long-term relationship for 15 years that didn't end the way I'd hoped, but wasn't terrible, and was a starting point to learn how to grow as a person and partner. I also obviously know I can commit. I've also just generally mellowed out in middle age. I will ask tough questions, if need be, but I don't yell or anything like that. 

I think my partner may be struggling with being a relationship and perhaps to having kids around and is maybe a bit self-sabotaging. She clearly likes a lot about being in a relationship, she's very affectionate and loves to cuddle, bathe together, etc. but also as this other streak of almost inventing problems.

One thing that scares me is that I've really put my heart and energy into this relationship. I don't feel I've left a lot on the table, so I'm not really sure what else I can do if more is needed from me. 

So where do I go from here? part of me wonders if we could set it straight. I don't want to invest months and years if she's going to flake out on me, I think I deserve more than that.

What do I do now? Am I never getting a job?‚Äù

There‚Äôs a ton of good advice on this sub so I figured I‚Äôd aggregate some of the most helpful (tactically and emotionally) comments and posts from the past few years into one super-post for any students out there feeling not so hot right now.¬†

I‚Äôd also just like to add myself briefly: It‚Äôs okay. Really. 

It really does happen to the best of us. Law school is weird and sometimes it takes a while to get your sea legs. You‚Äôre not doomed yet. Plenty of folks (including [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1g8ui1j/i_broke_into_big_law_without_going_to_a_t14_and/)) were heartbroken after our first semester grades were released and still go on to have great jobs in all sorts of fields including big law, government, in-house, whatever. You‚Äôre not the only one, and while yes, some jobs can be an uphill battle and things will be hard, you‚Äôre not out of the game yet.¬†

So here we go. A list of some great advice I‚Äôve read from reddit on what to do if your grades were bleh and how to tackle the job hunt now.¬†

# Big Themes/TDLR:

1. **Network like a demon.** This is going to be your biggest lever you can pull until you get a new set of grades later. It will also be the thing that lets you punch above your grades to land things you might not have otherwise. 
2. **Apply to 1L jobs that might be less grade sensitive** (i.e. some state and local government jobs, some public interest, maybe some small firms if you want to work at a firm, etc.). And even if some places are grade sensitive, shoot your shot anyways. There‚Äôs no harm in trying. You never know unless you try, and plenty of people were picked up at spots they didn‚Äôt expect their grades to make the cut.¬†You'll have another bite at the apple for 2L jobs, and even post-grad. Getting good experience and building relationships over your 1L will make you a stronger applicant for jobs later. 
3. **As awkward as it is, go talk to every single one of your professors and ask what happened.** Was it that you just outright didn‚Äôt know the material? You didn‚Äôt IRAC? Missed big issues? The test taking strategies they might be able to share with you will apply to future exams, even in entirely different subject areas. Then, go talk to your TAs if they‚Äôre open to it. Get a second look at those exams. Then do that again with legal tutors (many schools will automatically give you them if your grades are below a certain threshold, but if they don‚Äôt, ask for them anyways). You basically are looking for as many data points as possible to figure out what went wrong and how you can systematically improve next semester.

# Advice From Redditors

>**@**[**Laws\_of\_Coffee**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Laws_of_Coffee/)  
  
I got put on academic probation after 1L fall. I worked a judicial externship for the first summer. It was great. Second summer I worked a government honors law clerkship and am returning part time to them in the spring.  
  
You‚Äôre not outta the count. Work with your school. Figure out what went wrong on exams. Attend class. Take good notes. You‚Äôll perform and get outta the hole.  
  
A lot and I mean a LOT of the hiring process is personality. Be a good person and be kind and that energy will carry you far.



>@[**Psychological\_Snow27**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychological_Snow27/)  
  
I had a rough first semester and thought that my big law goals were shot out of the gate. But I took the opportunity to reassess my approach and work smarter in the following semesters and ended up having a successful recruiting experience for big law.   
  
I ended up getting a 1L big law summer position with what I think may have been the lowest GPA the firm had ever accepted from my school, then raised my grades substantially and had a lot of options for 2L summer. Now I‚Äôm about to enter a top firm in a top market.  
  
The feeling you‚Äôre experiencing isn‚Äôt a fun one, but you‚Äôre not at the end of the road. Just focus on improvement and start networking heavily.



>@[**bighairbigtex**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bighairbigtex/)  
  
How heavily your first semester grades are weighted depends on your goals. There are many traditionally competitive jobs (biglaw, clerkships) where first year grades are the most important year of grades. But plenty of other employers (like small firms, some public defender offices, local government) exist where grades aren‚Äôt as important, or where they might look at an upward trend as a sign of hard work.  
  
If you go to a school where people actually get C-range grades, the most grade sensitive employers were probably a long shot anyway (and now with a C, they are almost certainly off the table).  
  
So, you shouldn‚Äôt be looking at fed gov, fed clerk, or large/prestigious firms. But those are far from the only legal employers, and one C shouldn‚Äôt take you out of range for other kinds of jobs.



>**@**[**zarigueya4014**](https://www.reddit.com/user/zarigueya4014/)  
  
Tis not the end of the world. My first semester grades were a big shock too, they are for many. Take time to rest, lick your wounds, and then lock in when this new semester starts. That includes meeting with professors to review your exams and figure out where you went wrong. Was it a test taking issue? A study habit issue? A little of both? Something else? Professors are a great resource for answering this question. Otherwise, realize that a 2.7 is not the end of the world and you're still very likely on track to graduate and become a lawyer.   
  
Still apply to all the jobs that interest you, regardless of whether you think your GPA is too low. If a potential employer asks about your grades, be honest with them about what didn't go as planned this semester, and what you're actively doing to improve yourself. Employers, if they're human, realize that nobody is perfect and what matters a lot is how someone reacts to their own stumbles. You've got this! Don't let that imposter syndrome sink your dreams.



>**@**[**tenyeartreasurybill**](https://www.reddit.com/user/tenyeartreasurybill/)

>Apply everywhere. If you‚Äôre not picky about location look at firms that are not ‚Äúbiglaw‚Äù but carry similar early career earning potential like AmLaw 200 firms or Delaware local counsel shops.

>Apply to secondary market offices for V100 firms too, and of course don‚Äôt close any doors on yourself and apply to primary markets within the V100 too.

>Being above a 3.0 at a good school puts you above the grade cut-offs for a lot of places. Some firms won‚Äôt look below a 3.3/3.5 whatever but ‚Äúbiglaw‚Äù (or a biglaw salary at least) is definitely not out of the question.



>**@**[**IndividualBee8900**](https://www.reddit.com/user/IndividualBee8900/)

>My school doesn‚Äôt rank‚Äîwhich presents its own challenges, but suffice it to say it depends. The biggest thing with 1L is doing well. The assumption with any grade is you tried your hardest. I‚Äôm sorry you fell short of your expectations.

>Decide whether big law is the goal, the means to an end, or a way to make money during law school. If it‚Äôs option 1‚Äìand depending on your law school rank and geographic market‚Äîa 1L big firm job is probably not in the cards. For 2L it‚Äôs potential, but start applying and networking now. For ‚Äòlower‚Äô GPAs and big law, it might take till 3L. So think about what you can do during the summers and the school year.   
  
Look at an unconventional route that interests you. In my experience, lawyers care way more about how much work you are willing to do adequately than how much you can do excellently. Networking is key and people will admire a hardcore smiling grinder than a pompous intellectual. Here‚Äôs my story as an example. Caveat, I took two years of free jobs in two different countries, emailed literally every financial institution and law firm with a market cap over $500 million and every lawyer there who went to my school, and asked every professor if they had projects I could help with.

>I was a university athlete during 1L and 2L. I was a professional athlete 1L summer and worked for less than minimum wage at a PI firm. During 2L I studied abroad and took all financial regulatory and free speech classes and did financial litigation for free while maintaining my athletic status. During my 2L summer I wrote law articles with a professor at Cambridge, during the first semester 2L I wrote an article for a professor, second semester I wrote two for professors, 3L fall I wrote for another professor and now my 3L spring, I‚Äôm writing an article with a SCOTUS justice and another professor. I was on a journal but it wasn‚Äôt law review. My Cambridge articles were published in my schools law review, one was published with The Hague commission on war crimes, and the final ones are with the Court. 3L I took a free job working for an investment bank reviewing contracts and helped coach my university sports team. I finally landed a big law job slightly before finals.

>I went to every non-school networking event I could find, failed a ton at making connections and slowly got better. I was called stupid a third of the time during networking calls and learned when some things were worth more time than others.

>Keep this in mind, no one wants to see you fail, everyone will help, no one can help you as much as you can. Take advice with a grain of salt, but don‚Äôt write it off. You don‚Äôt want to go into interviews or networks trying to impress people, go in honestly telling them what you want, something that interests them, and find out about them. Follow-up like crazy cause no one does. As a 24 year old 2L I spoke to people that my professors have been how TF did you meet that person, as a second semester 3L, I‚Äôm polite and helpful and just willing to work. That is what got me my job with a slightly above curve gpa when I was under the curve for three semesters.

>Finally, experienced, high-ranking lawyers want mentees. I know three general councils for the three biggest US banks in the world‚Äîpurely out of networking, no family ties or even my law school network. One GC told me that he‚Äôd rather have a young lawyer from Fordham who works than a Harvard grad who is just smart.



>**@**[**Expensive\_Change\_443**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Expensive_Change_443/)

>Not to be a Debbie downer, so let me start out with nothing is actually impossible. But that being said, you have an uphill battle. The chances of, in one semester, going from below the average to high enough for an OCI SA candidate GPA range is slim to none. Keep in mind that the very top of your class likely was all As, and will likely be there or pretty damn close again. So just doing the math, you shifting from B50 to T10-25% in one more semester isn‚Äôt very likely. So my advice would be twofold.   
  
First, do something meaningful with your 1L summer that helps your non-GPA credentials for OCI. If you qualify, look into the 1L diversity clerkships some big law firms offer. Look into nonprofit fellowships or split fellowships sponsored by big law firms. Look into other prestigious, but less competitive opportunities. A lot of government agencies ‚Äúhire‚Äù volunteer legal interns. These are still tough to get and prestigious, but may not be advertised as widely or as competitive as OCI or paid 2L government internships, especially outside of the DoJ. Seconds, without giving up entirely, it may be time to start thinking outside BL, at least as a 2L/post grad option.   
  
Think about a) what else you might be interested in, and b) how important big law vs. a particular practice area within it is. There are some back door ways into ‚Äúnon-partner track‚Äù staff attorney position laterals that have similar compensation to associate positions without the pressure/competition. Particularly, from what I have heard, business based immigration, taxes, and estates tend to be ‚Äúspecialty groups‚Äù within a lot of big firms that don‚Äôt hire attorneys through the traditional OCI track.   
  
Consider going to a boutique or mid size firm in one of those practice areas to set yourself up for an early career lateral. Also, even if your grades don‚Äôt go up dramatically, if you are set on big law, apply through OCI. Some career service folks and big law hiring folks discourage it and say it shows a lack of ability/willingness to follow directions. I have also heard others describe it as a sign of ambition and confidence and willingness to try difficult things. The worst that will happen is you won‚Äôt get an interview or won‚Äôt get hired (which will also happen if you don‚Äôt apply).



>**@**[**Distinct\_Number\_3658**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct_Number_3658/)

>Network! Network! Network!!! I got my 1L summer clerk position by cold emailing alumni. Most alumni I emailed didn‚Äôt even respond. It‚Äôs a numbers game. One alumni I emailed happened to be the managing partner of a boutique law firm. I emailed asking to connect on how to transition into the legal field from XYZ law school. I never even spoke directly about a job, and out of the blue during finals week she sent me an email asking if I would clerk for her. I was (kinda) offered a post-grad position last week, and continue to work throughout the school year.

>My 1L grades were bad. (2.4 first semester on a 3.0 curve, and had to retake civ pro due to getting under a C) The attorney who ended up hiring me never even asked about grades or my transcript.

>Have you ever heard lawyers say, if the facts are on your side you argue the facts, but if the law is on your side, you argue the law? There‚Äôs a similar principle here in my opinion. If your grades are good, lead with your transcript. If they aren‚Äôt, lead with your personality and desire to add value. Sell yourself. You, yes you, can and will do this!



>**@**[**haysfan**](https://www.reddit.com/user/haysfan/)

>Hang in there. Two critical things to remember:

>Learn from your mistakes. Meet with each professor. Identify what specifically prevented you from earning a higher grade. Figure out if those things are attributable to gaps in knowledge, study methods, or something else. Adjust accordingly.

>Your law school career is not over. Make some adjustments, pull your GPA up. That will make you a more competitive job applicant. While a bad first semester may disqualify you from some things, it won‚Äôt disqualify you from everything. Focus on pulling your GPA up and you‚Äôll have a great career. 



>**@**[**nuggetofpoop**](https://www.reddit.com/user/nuggetofpoop/)   
  
Many employers don't ask about grades. Don't worry about it too much. Focus on improving your studies. If you can't find a 1L summer gig, see if you can RA, take classes, do clinic, or find some law-related volunteer work.



>**@**[**jce8491**](https://www.reddit.com/user/jce8491/)

>It happens. Keep working hard. Some people are better at law school tests than others. My personal view (everybody has their own opinion) is that supplements aren't useful. Your professor is going to teach the class in the way that matters to them. They're grading your exam, so you need to learn from them and rely on what they say.

>The other thing I'll say is that taking practice tests is very important. Get your outlines done and then immediately go to practice tests (in the period leading up to the exam). Understanding how to apply what you know is more important than rote memorization (particularly in classes where you can use an outline). I'd recommend going to your professors and reviewing the exams. It might be painful, but you learn the most from your mistakes.

>As for 1L summer employment, just don't put your GPA on your resume. There are jobs that will take you, particularly unpaid internships. Get out there and network.



>**@**[**Fuzzy\_Purple\_Llama**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuzzy_Purple_Llama/)

>I failed a class 1L year 2nd semester, and the rest of my grades were either a C or C+.

>I'm now in my last semester and have my post-grad job lined up.

>I had a clerk position the summer after 1L. The summer after 2L, I had two clerk positions. One of which extended into last semester. This semester, I'm working at the firm that will be my post-grad associate attorney job.

>So... take a little time to be angry and sad. Then suck it up and handle your business. Also, think outside the box when looking for jobs. Don't rely on your school's job bank...whete a lot of other students from your school AND OTHERS are competing for a very limited number of spots.



And lastly, on a nice note.



>**@**[**quailsdontquack**](https://www.reddit.com/user/quailsdontquack/)

>Stick with it‚Äî 1L fall is about learning how to learn. Have faith that you‚Äôll do better in the spring.



>**@**[**ErinGoBoo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ErinGoBoo/)

>Also, stop telling yourself you can't do it. My first semester was an absolute dumpster fire... and when I say it was a dumpster fire I mean I was a solid C student brought down by a D+. I did worse my second semester. I have managed to make a complete turnaround, and while I can't say I'm now getting straight As and am top of my class, I can tell you I'm still here, I'm more confident, and I feel like I actually belong now. I have stopped telling myself I don't belong here and the school made a terrible mistake taking me in. I have stopped deciding what my bad class is going to be every term. I have decided I am going to graduate from law school. This is all stuff I didn't do through my 1L year. You are your own worst enemy, so stop it. You can do this.

Hey, I‚Äôm 18M, and I‚Äôm in 12th grade now. In a few months, I‚Äôll finally leave behind the nightmare that has been my school life. But before that, I want to share my story‚Äîthe story of how a girl, fueled by her delusions and petty vendettas, almost destroyed me.
It started way back in the third grade. Our teacher, in her infinite wisdom, decided to pair students based on academic performance‚Äî‚Äúweak‚Äù ones with ‚Äústrong‚Äù ones. I got paired with her. Let‚Äôs call her Kavya. From day one, she wasn‚Äôt fond of me. I don‚Äôt know what it was‚Äîmaybe my quiet nature rubbed her the wrong way‚Äîbut she made it clear she thought I didn‚Äôt belong.
Fast forward to middle school, and things only got worse. Kavya was one of those girls who had the perfect mix of popularity and pretty privilege. Everyone liked her. Me? I was the introverted, awkward kid, but I had a good friend group‚Äîa bunch of kids who adopted me despite my shy nature.
But then came the incident. One day, in a moment of pure coincidence, I made a lip-smacking sound, and she somehow interpreted it as a ‚Äúflying kiss.‚Äù I swear it was nothing of the sort. But Kavya? She twisted it into a personal attack, dredging up some harassment case involving another guy and projecting all of it onto me. It was like she decided right then and there that I was the villain in her story.
And boy, did she act on that.
She started spreading rumors‚Äînasty ones. That I was dirty, that I was poor, that I harassed her. She‚Äôd weaponize her popularity to make me the laughingstock of the school. Kids would call me ‚Äústinky,‚Äù mock me in the hallways, and treat me like dirt.
What hurt the most was when my own friend group began to pull away. None of them believed her lies‚Äîthank God for that. But the constant criticism and bullying from others forced them to distance themselves. It wasn‚Äôt their fault, I guess. No one wants to be on the receiving end of that kind of targeted hate.
Then, our school shut down, and we all moved to a new one. I thought maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôd get a fresh start. But nope. Kavya carried her crusade against me to the new school. She made sure everyone ‚Äúknew‚Äù about me before I even had a chance to introduce myself. I became the outcast‚Äîsocially isolated, bullied, and miserable.
By 9th grade, all my old friends had switched schools. I was left behind, stuck in a place where Kavya‚Äôs manipulations ran unchecked. Every day felt like a battle just to keep my head above water. I turned to caffeine to cope. I‚Äôd chug coffee just to get through the day, hoping the buzz would drown out the exhaustion of constantly defending my existence.
There was one friend I truly thought would stick by me. Let‚Äôs call him Raj. He was the one who brought me into our friend group back in the old school, the one who saw through Kavya‚Äôs lies from the start. But Raj left too‚Äîgot a sports scholarship at another school and moved on. He found new friends and forgot about me. That betrayal hurt more than anything.
And Kavya? She didn‚Äôt stop. Even at our farewell, she found a way to humiliate me. Someone from a junior group chat I was part of called her out for something and so did the rest, and she automatically assumed it was me. While she herself , crammed into some tiny car and came for the event, and called me ‚Äúbroke‚Äù for not driving there myself. The truth? I couldn‚Äôt drive, so I took a cab. What‚Äôs the big deal ?
Oh, and the outfit-shaming? Classic Kavya. One of her minions sneered at my jacket, calling it something a pan shop owner would wear. But when he saw it was D&G, the look on his face was priceless.
But you know what? I‚Äôve survived. Despite everything, I‚Äôm still here. A few more months, and I‚Äôll be out of this hellhole, leaving Kavya and her toxic circus behind.
Looking back, I realize she never really ‚Äúruined‚Äù my life. Sure, she made it hell for a while, but I‚Äôm still standing. And I know, deep down, that her actions say more about her insecurities than anything about me.
To anyone going through something similar‚Äîstay strong. The people who matter will see through the lies, and the ones who believe them? They were never worth your time anyway.",5,1735497426.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.77,False

1hp2flc,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditwritescunk/comments/1hp2flc/cunk_on_incels/,Cunk On Incels,"Incels are people who call themselves ""involuntary celibates,"" which means they‚Äôre not having sex but not by choice. It‚Äôs a bit like being unemployed but angrier about it. Instead of blaming the job market, though, they blame women. They‚Äôll say things like, ‚ÄúAll women only date bad boys like Chad who drive sports cars,‚Äù as if women come pre-programmed to hate modest hatchbacks and nice manners. Apparently, it‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs fault they‚Äôre not pulling, which is a bit like blaming fish for not jumping into your boat when you haven‚Äôt bothered to bring a fishing rod.

They spend a lot of time on the internet, in forums where they complain about things like ""Chads""‚Äîmen who are good at life‚Äîand ""Stacys,"" women who dare to have boyfriends. They might share stories of someone they saw at the gym, a ""Chad"" lifting weights and chatting to women, and how that guy is the sole reason they can‚Äôt find a girlfriend. It‚Äôs basically the grown-up version of sulking in your room, except now they can type long essays about why they deserve a girlfriend because they once held a door open for their nan.

The problem with incels is they think life is like a vending machine: you put in enough ""nice guy points,"" and sex is supposed to fall out. They‚Äôll complain about buying someone a coffee or giving them a compliment, then fume when it doesn‚Äôt result in pants flying off. But relationships don‚Äôt work like that. They‚Äôre more like Ikea furniture‚Äîyou have to put in effort, and even then, it might fall apart if you don‚Äôt follow the instructions.

Incels also have their own bizarre vocabulary, like they‚Äôre trying to sound more academic about being bitter. They talk about ""the black pill,"" which isn‚Äôt an actual pill but a depressing belief that the world is rigged against them. They‚Äôll write posts about how ""women only date men over six feet tall,"" like all women carry measuring tapes around in their handbags. They even rank people‚Äôs attractiveness with something called a ""lookism scale,"" which sounds scientific until you realize it‚Äôs just an excuse to whinge about their jawlines while comparing themselves to Chris Hemsworth.

What‚Äôs strange is that they don‚Äôt seem to realize they‚Äôre the problem. They call themselves ""nice guys,"" but being nice isn‚Äôt just about saying ‚Äúhello‚Äù without growling‚Äîit‚Äôs about empathy and treating people like humans, not objects in a game. Instead of trying to connect with others, they post long rants about how ""modern women"" are shallow because they like men with hobbies. The irony is, if they spent as much time improving themselves as they do complaining, they might not need a label at all.

The full conversation unraveled before me-talk of sneaking around after meetings,making excuses for""work dinners,""and even plans to continue their affair after the wedding.
The worst part;he was doing it with my trusted employee,Claire Winslow.
After spending days crying and feeling desperate,I knew I had to do something.
I made a ten-step revenge plan,and the first step was to gather evidence.

Evidence
Paul and I had been together for over ten years,building a business,planning a future,and getting ready for the wedding of our dreams.But one click changed everything.
I stumbled upon a shared document in his Cloud Drive-a document that wasn't meant for me.It was filled with secret rendezvous plans,love notes,and hotel receipts.
The worst part;he was doing it with my trusted employee,Claire Winslow.In that moment,something inside me snapped.
Our perfect life?A lie.Our business?No longer his.And this wedding?It wasn't going to be canceled-it was going to be the start of their downfall.
I wasn't the heartbroken fiancee who would quietly walk away.No,I would take everything.Brick by brick,I would destroy them both.They thought they could cheat and get away with it.They had no idea who they were messing with.
I was knee-deep in wedding planning,juggling work while preparing for the biggest day of my life.
One evening,as I finalized our wedding invites,I shared the guest list with my fiance,Paul Foster,on Cloud Drive.
He was away for a business conference,so this was our way of staying organized.
Everything seemed perfect-until something strange caught my eye.
A few days ago,he logged into his email on my laptop,so today I accidentally opened the drive using his account.
As I scrolled through the folders,I noticed the latest edited document that I didn't recognize.It was titled [Business Projections-Q3.]Boring,typical.But something about it felt off.I hadn't created it,and it wasn't part of any current project.
Curiosity got the better of me.
I clicked on it,expecting a dry business file.
Instead,it opened to a short message:
[Can't stop thinking about that night at the hotel...next time I'll wear red]My stomach dropped.This wasn't some business document.It was shared with only Paul and this email I had never seen before:Cl_win@wemail.c-om.Something was definitely off.
Shaking,I checked the document history.
The full conversation unraveled before me
-talk of sneaking around after meetings,making excuses for""work dinners,""and even plans to continue their affair after the wedding,like it was just a bump in the road to their perfect little secret.
I stared at the screen,disbelief crashing over me.They had been using our business as cover for their affair,planning romantic weekends while I had been pouring my heart into our future.
The document wasn't even hidden.He had gotten so comfortable,so careless,that he didn't bother to erase the evidence.
-
And now,here it was in his shared folder,staring me in the face like a twisted gift from the universe.
""Hey,sorry,Ruby.I can't make it today.
Can you do the food tasting with your mom?""he said when I called to remind him about our appointment.Same excuse,different day.I bit my tongue and forced a light tone.""Yeah,sure.Just don't overwork yourself,alright?""
As soon as the call ended,I clenched my fists.His time was coming.I would definitely make it happen.
After spending days crying and feeling desperate,I knew I had to do something.I made a ten-step revenge plan,and the first step was to gather evidence.
Without him suspecting a thing,I scoured his phone,emails,and financial records,seeking undeniable proof of his affair.
We had always kept things simple,sharing one WeCloud account for our devices.It was convenient for syncing our calendars,documents,and photos.As I browsed through my phone's photo gallery,I noticed new images had been synced from his device.
Most of them were mundane-screenshots of emails,photos from work trips.But then,mixed in between,I found a photo that didn't belong.It was a picture of Claire Winslow,our employee,in lingerie,posing in front of a mirror in a hotel room.
My chest tightened,and I quickly swiped,hoping it was a mistake.But the next photo was even worse-him,shirtless in the same room,grinning at the camera.This confirmed the affair between the two of them.
Then,one afternoon,while I was working from home and he was supposedly still in a meeting,I opened the Streamify app to play our usual playlist.That was when I noticed a recently added playlist titled [Late
Nights.]It wasn't our music,and it wasn't public.Curious,I clicked on it.
It was filled with romantic songs we had never listened to,with titles like ""Secret Love Song,""""Wildest Dreams,""and ""Dirty Little Secret..""I then saw her profile-Claire-had been adding songs too,with little love notes in the description:[For our weekend getaway,[That night.]I realized they had been secretly sharing songs,creating a world I had no idea about.
The playlist was their own soundtrack to the affair.
It took me a few weeks,as I was busy with work and wedding preparations.But once I had it all-the secret meetings,inappropriate messages,and even hotel receipts-I filed them away for later.My goal was to strike when it would hurt the most.
-
Isolating Taking Over
The second step was to isolate him socially.
I knew that cutting him off from our social circles had to be done carefully-slowly,without raising any alarms.So,I started small,weaving stories into casual conversations.
At brunch with our mutual friends,I would bring up how he had been ""so busy lately.
""Oh,he's been out of town a lot recently,""I would say with a sigh,playing the understanding fiancee.""I get it;he's got work meetings and all,but with the wedding coming up,I wish he could be around more.""
It was the kind of thing that made people sympathetic but also raised a silent red flag.
I played it off,always smiling,as if it were no big deal.But as I dropped these little tidbits,I could see doubt flicker in their eyes.
As the days passed,I continued to paint a picture of a man who was distracted,distant,and maybe even a little unreliable.
When some of his friends,who happened to work with me,asked how the wedding planning was going,I would tell them,""Oh,you know,he's got his hands full with work,so I've been handling most of the details on my own.He's busy flying out for meetings every few days.But that okay-he's stressed;I get it.""
The more I shared these seemingly innocent remarks,the more people started to question his commitment.They would murmur behind his back,wondering why he was leaving me to handle everything alone when our wedding was just around the corner.
Friends would text me to ""check in,""
concerned about how I was holding up.
Some even voiced their doubts,saying things like,""It's kind of weird he's not more involved,don't you think?""
I would laugh it off,acting like the supportive partner,but I knew exactly what I was doing.With each conversation,the seeds of doubt were taking root.Slowly but surely,people began to drift away from him,Some of his""bro""stopped inviting him out for drinks,probably afraid to take more of his time.Others made excuses when he reached out,claiming they were ""too busy'""to meet up.
I wasn't openly accusing him of anything
-that would have made me look suspicious.Instead,I played the role of the devoted fiancee who""understood""why her fiance was so absent.
But behind the scenes,I was gradually turning our friends against him,leaving him isolated,with fewer people to lean on.
In their eyes,I was the patient bride-to-be,doing everything to make the relationship work,while he seemed too preoccupied to care.Little by little,our mutual friends began siding with me,their loyalties shifting as I subtly rewrote the narrative of our relationship.He never even saw it coming.
-
While he was distracted by his affair,I took the opportunity to set the third step in motion,carefully and deliberately taking control of our shared business assets.
It wasn't something that could happen overnight-he was too involved in the business for that.So I played the long game,working behind the scenes while he focused on sneaking around with her.
First,I started with small changes-documents he barely noticed.Whenever we had meetings with our accountant or legal team,I would act as if I was just being thorough,asking to review contracts and paperwork that we had already signed.
He would wave me off,too distracted to pay attention.""You handle it,""he would say,.
shrugging as though our finances were the least of his worries.That was exactly what I wanted.
I made sure I was always the one to handle the paperwork.If there was a contract to sign,I would volunteer to deal with it.
When our accountant sent over forms for investments or property holdings,I would tell him I'd take care of it-making sure to slip in additional clauses or have certain assets quietly listed under my name.
He was so distracted by his affair that he never questioned why I was suddenly so involved in the details.
The key was in the subtlety.I couldn't make any drastic changes too quickly,or he might have caught on.Instead,I slowly began transferring small portions of our shared investments into accounts that I controlled.
When we bought new equipment for the business,I ensured the purchase orders listed me as the sole owner.I even had some of our most important contracts rewritten,making sure my name was on every significant legal document.
To protect myself,I worked with a lawyer he didn't know about-someone who specialized in business takeovers and asset protection.
Together,we built a watertight case,ensuring that if he ever tried to challenge me,I would have the upper hand.I gathered every piece of evidence I needed to prove that the assets were rightfully mine.
As the weeks passed,I took control of the accounts one by one-our investments,our business holdings,even the bank accounts that funded our day-to-day operations.It was a slow,deliberate process.
I made sure not to leave any obvious traces or do anything that would alert him.He was still wrapped up in his double life,too distracted to notice the slow takeover of everything we had built together.
There were moments when he would glance at a statement or bring up a concern about the business,but I always had a quick answer ready.
""""It's all under control,""I would say with a reassuring smile,and he would nod,relieved that I was handling it.Little did he know,I was preparing to take everything away from him.
By the time he realized something was off,it would already be too late.The business he thought we shared would be mine every asset,every investment,and every piece of property that mattered.He would be left with nothing.
-
Sabotage the Mistress
Claire Winslow wasn't just his secret lover
-she was also one of our longest-standing employees,practically there from day one.
She held a key role in the company,which made things tricky,but also gave me a direct path to ruin them both.If I played my cards right,I wouldn't just take down their affair-I would wreck their careers altogether.
I knew I couldn'tjust expose their affair without consequences,so instead,I focused on systematically dismantling her role in the company,piece by piece.This was the fourth step.
First thing first,I needed to start planting bad seeds.Whenever Claire and I discussed potential business leads or new partnerships,,I would""accidentally""slip her false information.
I told her about meetings with supposed investors who were difficult to work with or potential clients with bad reputations.I always phrased it like it was a tip-off or insider in-fo,so she would not question it too much.
""Hey,Claire,""I would say casually over coffee,""I heard from a contact that there's this huge investor interested in our market.
Maybe it's worth a look?""
Of course,the deals would always fail.The investors I sent her to either were not interested or had a reputation for being impossible to work with.
Claire started fumbling through meetings,looking more and more incompetent in front of the board.Word about her screw-ups spread fast,and she had no idea I was the one pulling the strings.
Nobody called her out directly,but it was clear-she was slowly being iced out.Fewer meetings,no one asking for her input.It was only a matter of time.
But I didn't stop there.While she was busy chasing bad leads,I worked behind the scenes to rally the rest of the team around me.I made myself the indispensable leader,the one who got things done.
Whenever Claire made mistakes,I was there to fix them,stepping in to ensure projects stayed on track.I made sure that the rest of the team saw me as the reliable one-the person they could trust to steer the company in the right direction.",1,1735497101.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

It was kinda radio silence on both ends save a few comments and likes on instagram and stuff like that. Then on Halloween she gives me candy, recognized me even though I was in costume and I bleached the tips of my hair and never shown/told her. then a few weeks later I went to see her stage play and after I see her outside and call her name. She looks up seems excited to see me, runs over hugs me and then thanks me for coming.

so I don‚Äôt know. It seems like these are fairly normal interactions between two people of the opposite gender. But I‚Äôm a romantic and my brain wants to believe I have a chance. Right now I‚Äôm on winter break from college and I guess the current plan is when I get back, ask if she wants to get coffee to catch up. Then maybe mention the next 24 show event (cuz after I did it in the first semester she said it looked fun and she wishes she did it) and then maybe do that with her but idk.

deep down I think shes just being friendly, but I want to believe its more. theres only one way to find out tho.

1hp268z,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hp268z/help_me_to_overcome_myself/,Help me to overcome myself ,"Hello everyone, I need some advice, please.

I own a business, but I'm actually a freelancer. My business is a pizzeria that offers pick-up and home delivery services only, we don‚Äôt provide table service.

I have a Valoriani stone oven (an Italian brand) that uses wood, and my brother is the pizzaiolo (pizza maker). He worked for 12 years with an Italian pizzaiolo trained in Naploes, where he learned the art of operating a stone oven, making pizza dough, preparing the original sauce... everything needed to make authentic pizzas.
Actually, the Italian pizzaiolo offered to join if we are able to match his salary.

The challenge is that running this pizzeria wasn‚Äôt my idea. It was my family‚Äôs, and they asked me to help them launch it, using all our family savings for the business. However, my dream is to become a flight attendant for Emirates. 
I feel stuck in this job, working as a freelancer, and it‚Äôs draining my energy, energy I‚Äôd rather use to prepare for Emirates' open day. I need to improve my English and French and lose weight because I'm currently overweight.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on how to organize my day and week.


MY PLAN 

NOURISH MY BODY
Cooking Meals in Advance
I plan to cook all my meals for the day in the morning. This way, I can avoid unhealthy snacking when I feel overwhelmed or anxious. I‚Äôve realized that this habit of stress-eating has led to my weight gain.

BUSINESS HOURS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The pizzeria is now open five days a week (Wednesday to Sunday). 
Last year, we were open seven days, but I was completely exhausted and depressed from overworking.

Here‚Äôs the current work schedule:

Preparation (Morning): 10:00 a.m. ‚Äì 12:00 p.m.

First Shift (Open): 12:00 p.m. ‚Äì 4:00 p.m.

Second Preparation (Afternoon): 4:00 p.m. ‚Äì 6:00 p.m.

Second Shift (Open): 6:00 p.m. ‚Äì 12:00 a.m.

Cleaning and Prep for Next Day: 11:00 p.m. ‚Äì 1:00/2:00/3:00 a.m.


During preparation, I handle tasks like heating the stone oven, making dough, preparing sauces, roasting vegetables, cooking appetizers, and more. 
When free, I also focus on digital marketing, managing social media, organizing invoices, and ordering supplies.

I sometimes rest in the afternoons if I finish the preparation early.

MY BROTHER'S SCHEDULE AND ITS IMPACT ON MY WORKLOAD
Thia year, my brother is studying from 15:00 to 20:00, which makes me solely responsible for preparing everything for the second shift.  

I can‚Äôt count on him whenever I need help because it depends on whether he has homework or exams.

Since September, when he started his classes, I‚Äôve stopped opening for the first shift entirely because I don‚Äôt have enough energy or consistency to handle everything alone. 
The first preparation and the first shift have become overwhelming for me to manage by myself.

During the second preparation and the second shift, I‚Äôm also alone until 21:00, when he arrives. Even then, he rarely helps with the cleaning afterward because he‚Äôs usually busy with homework. Additionally, his educational portal doesn‚Äôt allow him to submit assignments after midnight, so he prioritizes finishing and submitting his work during this time.

FITNESS GIALS
I‚Äôm overweight (BMI over 24) and want to lose weight using my stationary bike every morning. Once I reach a BMI of 24, I‚Äôll join a gym to continue improving my fitness.

HYDRATION GOALS 
I‚Äôve started using a Stanley cup to ensure I drink enough water or unsweetened tea/coffee throughout the day.

STUDY GOALS
I aim to dedicate 4 hours a day to studying English and French to achieve C1 certification in both languages. My options for study locations are:
- A public library near my home.
- A university library near the pizzeria (but it doesn‚Äôt have public Wi-Fi).
- The pizzeria‚Äôs upstairs area, although it‚Äôs very cold during winter.


GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP 
Due to the demands of the pizzeria, I often can‚Äôt sleep properly. On the days when I‚Äôm responsible for opening the business by myself for the first shift, I don‚Äôt get enough rest, which leaves me exhausted. That's why I stopped opening in the first shift, however I want to open in the first shift 


OVERWHELMED RESPONSIBILITIES
I‚Äôd like to open the pizzeria on Mondays, but I‚Äôm often too exhausted due to the deep cleaning on Sundays.

I‚Äôm considering returning to lunch service (12:00 p.m. ‚Äì 4:00 p.m.), but it adds more preparation time and physical strain.

The challenge that concerns me the most is that I‚Äôm the one who ends up the most exhausted. This is because I‚Äôve learned to complete tasks much faster than my brother, especially tasks unrelated to making pizza. For example, I handle a lot of the additional chores, such as:

Cutting bacon, prosciutto, speck... in the industrial cutter, preparing desserts like tiramisu, panna cotta... , cleaning, prepping vegetables, cleaning the machines, washing dishes...


I worked in several restaurants before we started the pizzeria, which is why I‚Äôm skilled at these tasks. What takes my brother an hour, I can finish in 20 minutes. However, while I‚Äôm faster, that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt get tired.

He prefers to leave these tasks to me because of my efficiency, but it‚Äôs too much for one person. On top of this, I‚Äôm also responsible for all the non-physical tasks, including:

Managing marketing and creating social media posts, editing videos for promotions, organizing and scanning invoices, tracking inventory, placing supplier orders ...

And I have to add that he is the fastest at making pizzas because he has been doing it for over a decade. However, making pizzas only takes up the hours when we are open, so in the end, he doesn‚Äôt contribute as much overall.



Even though we don‚Äôt open on Mondays, I try to use that day to catch up on the digital tasks. However, I often feel so tired that I end up relaxing instead. This means the following week becomes more overwhelming for me, and our business sometimes suffers financial losses due to poor or no marketing efforts.

I handle a majority of both physical and digital responsibilities, and it‚Äôs leaving me burned out.

- If I think conversations are enjoyable and seem to go well should I give my phone number or even social media? (just so they know I‚Äôm not like catfishing?)
- I‚Äôm pretty busy on weekends as I have to work, are Sunday coffee/breakfast good first dates? 
- Also what are good conversation pieces to get the ball rolling? Like I mentioned it‚Äôs been 5 years since I‚Äôve been on a first date and kinda nerve racking.
- General advice?

I could kind of guess he felt some kind of attraction towards me, but we‚Äôd never spoken much and I never thought of him in that way‚Ä¶ until our office xmas party. 

We were all quite drunk, it was at a club, and he started calling me adorable, we were chatting and at the end of the night, he asked me if I wanted to get a drink back at his place. 

Long story short, we made out (nothing more than that) and he told me he liked me ever since the second time we spoke in the office (he remembered what I had told him and parroted it back to me) and wanted to take me out on a date. I was surprised and asked him why he‚Äôd never spoken much to me before and he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù, which I did not know what to make of. 

Asked for my number and asked to take me out over the weekend for dinner. In the end, I said no we shouldn‚Äôt, let‚Äôs stay colleagues because I didn‚Äôt want it getting messy; I‚Äôm a junior and he‚Äôs a senior + on probation. 

The next day I have regrets and message him. We wind up meeting for coffee (his suggestion) and it feels like a date‚Ä¶ except he tells me he‚Äôs thought it over and feels it‚Äôs too risky for him because he‚Äôs on probation and has just moved here. 

He also backtracked on saying he liked me and said he was attracted (which I‚Äôm reading as different from liking someone). I say okay and we agree to be friends. 

But he tells me things like ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve made my decision but I look at you and then that makes me wonder.‚Äù He also flirts over text at times. 

The other night he texted me when he was drunk asking me why I haven‚Äôt come to work recently (I was sick) and asking me if I was alright, saying he thinks I‚Äôm sweet etc. Asks for my instagram. Finally he says he‚Äôll send me skiing pics when he goes skiing‚Ä¶ and then just never does. 

Is he just playing a giant game and I‚Äôm not seeing through it? Is this just a lust thing or could there be genuine feelings there? I‚Äôm just confused and would really like a male perspective. 

Also please be kind! I‚Äôm not particularly experienced with these situations and have only had one relationship, so not well-versed in these things. ",3,1735496410.0,AskMenAdvice,15,1.0,False

Storytime:
My morning was going smoothly and I decided to try out my Willow Go again rather than using my Spectra blue. 

I want desperately to love the willow go but I haven't had a lot of luck with it. I get very low output, had one of the motors die, the app disconnects from the pumps, and have tried so many sizes of flanges (none get any more than others), etc. I've attended their pump and pour sessions, worked with their customer support, and am schedule for LC appointment. 

In any case, I figured it was worth trying again this morning. I got it assembled, in my bra, connected to the app, turned on and it actually began getting milk out of me. I sat down to enjoy my morning coffee and about halfway through my mug felt a little drip of something running down my torso. 

I looked down and found the bottom right side of my shirt and bra were soaked through. Tears welled up from my eyes and my husband's response was ""at least you're getting milk from the willow, you can't cry over spilled milk""

Yes. Yes, I can cry over spilled milk. Especially since I'm an underproducer and have to supplement with formula. I got 1 oz on the left and 0.2 oz on the right. I'm so frustrated. 

I know he was trying to calm me and refocus me on the positive aspect that I was getting milk using the willow but dammit, why couldn't he stop  drinking his coffee, comiserate with me, and then help me clean up the mess?

TL, DR: Wearable pump leaked milk, wasting the session, and partner said to not cry over spilled milk. ",1,1735496377.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I've bought my Flair 58+ couple months ago, but I've started using it in the last couple of days.

Before purchasing it I did some research on workflow but I've realized my assumptions were wrong.

My initial idea was to figure out exactly how much water can the chamber hold and fill my kettle with the right amount (taking into consideration the water loss due to evaporation and the tiny amount of water who remains in the kettle unless you flip it over and shake, or at least this happens in my  kettle).

This would've taken a lot of guessing out of the equation, and it was only a matter of learning the movement and timing.

I've then discovered that is not easy to test how much water can the chamber hold (i'd need at least a blind filter, but then the puck space would be filled with water) and also that whatever the quantity might be (probably around 90 ml from what I've read somewhere) I canno't heat only that, as apperently my kettle requires an higher amount of minimum water to heat at the temperatures i need (I set 97 C) otherwise it starts boiling and splashing out.

  
This need I have to rethink completely the whole filling process, and I've read some stuff around but they all seem to have a different approach.

Figuring out by myself wasn't great, I had a lot of hissing and sizzling water remaining at top of the chamber, somewhat splashing around, erratic pressure profile, very wet puck. The resulting coffee was surprisingly not bad.

Do you have any suggestion for me? Thanks in advance!",2,1735496302.0,FlairEspresso,8,1.0,False

So, I finally watched Squid Game Season 2, and let me say this... I came in expecting a gourmet meal of shocking twists and rich character arcs but left feeling like I‚Äôd been served instant noodles‚Ä¶without the seasoning packet. Had several naps while at it. 

First off, the games. Three. Just THREE. And they were about as thrilling as watching paint dry. Remember the nerve-wracking, ingenious games from Season 1? Yeah, forget that. It felt like they had a brainstorming session over coffee, and someone said, ""Eh, let's just wing it."" And wing it they did‚Äîstraight into mediocrity.

Now, the characters. Where do I even begin? It's like they were randomly assigned emotional backstories by AI. I couldn‚Äôt connect with anyone. Not one. The cast felt more like placeholders than people, and I‚Äôd honestly cheer more for a cardboard cutout. Season 1 gave us characters we cried over. Season 2 gave us‚Ä¶well, warm bodies.

And let‚Äôs not forget the twists‚Äîor rather, the complete absence of them. I guessed every outcome faster than Gi-hun could dye his hair red. It‚Äôs like they took the unpredictability that made Season 1 iconic, stuffed it in a sack, and tossed it into the Han River.

Overall, it feels like the creators thought, ‚ÄúWell, people will watch anyway, so let‚Äôs just throw something together.‚Äù And sure, we watched, but we also rolled our eyes, yawned, and scrolled Reddit during the ‚Äútense‚Äù moments.

TL;DR: Season 2 is like meeting your favorite childhood celebrity only to find out they‚Äôre just meh in real life. Watch it if you must, but don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.

I‚Äôve tried dozens of different cleansing methods throughout the decades and this is by far the best one. Six hours before bedtime stop eating all solid foods, liquid only. One hour before bedtime, take two 5mg Dulcolax bisacodyl tablets, and make sure to not have ANY milk or dairy at least an hour beforehand. At bedtime, take 45-60ml of Milk of Magnesia and drink one tall glass of water. Go to sleep and wake up 6-7 hours later. Drink a large coffee or two (you want the caffeine/hydration) and wait. You will unblock your intestines almost guaranteed. Because of my condition, very occasionally it will not work, however repeating the process the following night always seems to do the trick. Your first meal should consist of a cup of sugar-free yogurt or some probiotic food, and a very fiber-rich fruit/vegetable or nut mix to reset the gut bacteria. Just wanted to share my method in case anyone out there could really benefit from it. I find that enemas are great as well, however they destroy guy bacteria and you need to load up almost exclusively on probiotics/prebiotics the day of. Hope this helps!

Also, just a little tidbit if anyone is interested, I‚Äôve found that reducing my carbohydrates in my diet to 100g or less a day and heavily reducing refined sugar helps me stay somewhat regular. I‚Äôm talking carbohydrates mostly from bread, cane sugar, pasta, and cereals. Focusing more on meat, legumes, vegetables and fruits, milk, cheese, and yogurt seems to help, as well as fasting at least 14hrs of the 24hr cycle (which is at easy as skipping breakfast or dinner consistently depending on your preference) and sleeping at relatively the same time every night helps a lot too.

I‚Äôve been in a calorie deficit for 2 weeks now (consuming an average 1500 calories/day). I have been exercising every other day, alternating between steady state cardio days (~30 to 35 minutes) and strength training days (~1 hr). I am drinking half a case of water per day and sleeping at least 7 hours a day and usually a nap during the afternoon. I am not drinking alcohol. I work nights.

I have lost large amounts of weight numerous times in my life (60 lbs, 40 lbs) and I‚Äôve been caught in plateaus before, but have never had difficulty getting started. Previous weight loss campaigns involved daily intense exercise and I just don‚Äôt think I have another one of those in me at 32 years old, and can‚Äôt afford an injury with my job.

According to the calculator I‚Äôm using, my bare minimum maintenance calories if totally sedentary is around 2400. With light exercise it‚Äôs about 3000. This puts me in at least a 900-1500 calorie deficit range. I have not started losing weight. My energy levels are totally depleted after exercise days and I‚Äôm fueled almost entirely by black coffee and 0 cal energy drinks, so I‚Äôm pretty confident that I‚Äôm in a deficit by a good margin. 

According to the calculations, I should have lost 4-6 lbs by now. MyFitnessPal said 2 weeks ago that in 5 weeks I should have dropped down to 235 (obviously unrealistic, but no change after 2 weeks seems strange and I‚Äôm certainly not dropping 20 lbs in the next 3 weeks). 

Calorie tracking is accurate. I‚Äôm eating nothing except the lowest sodium microwaveable options I can find and sticking to the serving sizes very closely.

I own a business, but I'm actually a freelancer. My business is a pizzeria that offers pick-up and home delivery services only, we don‚Äôt provide table service.

I have a Valoriani stone oven (an Italian brand) that uses wood, and my brother is the pizzaiolo (pizza maker). He worked for 12 years with an Italian pizzaiolo trained in Naploes, where he learned the art of operating a stone oven, making pizza dough, preparing the original sauce... everything needed to make authentic pizzas.
Actually, the Italian pizzaiolo offered to join if we are able to match his salary.

The challenge is that running this pizzeria wasn‚Äôt my idea. It was my family‚Äôs, and they asked me to help them launch it, using all our family savings for the business. However, my dream is to become a flight attendant for Emirates. 
I feel stuck in this job, working as a freelancer, and it‚Äôs draining my energy, energy I‚Äôd rather use to prepare for Emirates' open day. I need to improve my English and French and lose weight because I'm currently overweight.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on how to organize my day and week.


MY PLAN 

NOURISH MY BODY
Cooking Meals in Advance
I plan to cook all my meals for the day in the morning. This way, I can avoid unhealthy snacking when I feel overwhelmed or anxious. I‚Äôve realized that this habit of stress-eating has led to my weight gain.

BUSINESS HOURS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The pizzeria is now open five days a week (Wednesday to Sunday). 
Last year, we were open seven days, but I was completely exhausted and depressed from overworking.

Here‚Äôs the current work schedule:

Preparation (Morning): 10:00 a.m. ‚Äì 12:00 p.m.

First Shift (Open): 12:00 p.m. ‚Äì 4:00 p.m.

Second Preparation (Afternoon): 4:00 p.m. ‚Äì 6:00 p.m.

Second Shift (Open): 6:00 p.m. ‚Äì 12:00 a.m.

Cleaning and Prep for Next Day: 11:00 p.m. ‚Äì 1:00/2:00/3:00 a.m.


During preparation, I handle tasks like heating the stone oven, making dough, preparing sauces, roasting vegetables, cooking appetizers, and more. 
When free, I also focus on digital marketing, managing social media, organizing invoices, and ordering supplies.

I sometimes rest in the afternoons if I finish the preparation early.

MY BROTHER'S SCHEDULE AND ITS IMPACT ON MY WORKLOAD
Thia year, my brother is studying from 15:00 to 20:00, which makes me solely responsible for preparing everything for the second shift.  

I can‚Äôt count on him whenever I need help because it depends on whether he has homework or exams.

Since September, when he started his classes, I‚Äôve stopped opening for the first shift entirely because I don‚Äôt have enough energy or consistency to handle everything alone. 
The first preparation and the first shift have become overwhelming for me to manage by myself.

During the second preparation and the second shift, I‚Äôm also alone until 21:00, when he arrives. Even then, he rarely helps with the cleaning afterward because he‚Äôs usually busy with homework. Additionally, his educational portal doesn‚Äôt allow him to submit assignments after midnight, so he prioritizes finishing and submitting his work during this time.

FITNESS GIALS
I‚Äôm overweight (BMI over 24) and want to lose weight using my stationary bike every morning. Once I reach a BMI of 24, I‚Äôll join a gym to continue improving my fitness.

HYDRATION GOALS 
I‚Äôve started using a Stanley cup to ensure I drink enough water or unsweetened tea/coffee throughout the day.

STUDY GOALS
I aim to dedicate 4 hours a day to studying English and French to achieve C1 certification in both languages. My options for study locations are:
- A public library near my home.
- A university library near the pizzeria (but it doesn‚Äôt have public Wi-Fi).
- The pizzeria‚Äôs upstairs area, although it‚Äôs very cold during winter.


GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP 
Due to the demands of the pizzeria, I often can‚Äôt sleep properly. On the days when I‚Äôm responsible for opening the business by myself for the first shift, I don‚Äôt get enough rest, which leaves me exhausted. That's why I stopped opening in the first shift, however I want to open in the first shift 


OVERWHELMED RESPONSIBILITIES
I‚Äôd like to open the pizzeria on Mondays, but I‚Äôm often too exhausted due to the deep cleaning on Sundays.

I‚Äôm considering returning to lunch service (12:00 p.m. ‚Äì 4:00 p.m.), but it adds more preparation time and physical strain.

The challenge that concerns me the most is that I‚Äôm the one who ends up the most exhausted. This is because I‚Äôve learned to complete tasks much faster than my brother, especially tasks unrelated to making pizza. For example, I handle a lot of the additional chores, such as:

Cutting bacon, prosciutto, speck... in the industrial cutter, preparing desserts like tiramisu, panna cotta... , cleaning, prepping vegetables, cleaning the machines, washing dishes...


I worked in several restaurants before we started the pizzeria, which is why I‚Äôm skilled at these tasks. What takes my brother an hour, I can finish in 20 minutes. However, while I‚Äôm faster, that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt get tired.

He prefers to leave these tasks to me because of my efficiency, but it‚Äôs too much for one person. On top of this, I‚Äôm also responsible for all the non-physical tasks, including:

Managing marketing and creating social media posts, editing videos for promotions, organizing and scanning invoices, tracking inventory, placing supplier orders ...

And I have to add that he is the fastest at making pizzas because he has been doing it for over a decade. However, making pizzas only takes up the hours when we are open, so in the end, he doesn‚Äôt contribute as much overall.



Even though we don‚Äôt open on Mondays, I try to use that day to catch up on the digital tasks. However, I often feel so tired that I end up relaxing instead. This means the following week becomes more overwhelming for me, and our business sometimes suffers financial losses due to poor or no marketing efforts.

I handle a majority of both physical and digital responsibilities, and it‚Äôs leaving me burned out.
