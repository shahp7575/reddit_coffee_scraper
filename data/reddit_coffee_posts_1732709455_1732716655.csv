1h153y9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h153y9,Sharing a prep!,"I’ll start by saying as we enter the holiday season, which is a hard time of year for many and especially this year a time of increased anxiety for many, if your having a hard time know that an internet stranger in the far reaches of dark and cold northern New England is thinking of you and wishing nothing but good things for you.

Our holidays are ok, but small. I’m afforded good time off from work and with no children or a large family I use this time of year to refresh some preps and restock things with holiday sales. I refreshed our car prep today and thought I would share it. 

I use club size empty (and of course washed) pretzel containers. I think these are great - they are food safe and free after eating the snacks. Reusing puts less waste into the system. They are air and water tight and nothing is going to get crushed in transit. They also hold quite a bit of food. I put these inside a zip top cooler style grocery bag with bottled water, wipes and a couple of easy grab snacks that don’t involve unpacking everything and a ziplock baggie with drink packets, freeze dried coffee packets, tea  bags.

I try to have preps for different scenarios. These are really meant to be grab and go if you are leaving by car. Maybe for going to a hotel, emergency shelter or someone else’s home. They would even be ok if you are needing to stay in a vehicle for a few days. In each container I have single serving tuna and chicken packets, oatmeal packets, protein and breakfast bars, peanut butter, crackers, applesauce pouches, dried fruit, a couple of freeze dried meal pouches (like the camping ones) and of course - snickers 😉. Nothing needs a can opener. Some things need water which I include in the larger bag. 

I pair this with other preps. I have a zip top bag with ‘hotel’ prep - I actually use this quite a bit if I’m traveling solo so I don’t have to eat out - but it has things like mini appliances, cutting board, utensils, a kettle, collapsible dish basin etc. basically a tiny kitchen in a bag. I also keep a kettle that will plug into my car to heat water. In our larger emergency ‘go bags’ we keep a week’s worth of self heating meals too. ",4,1732716454.0,TwoXPreppers,1,1.0,False
1h151ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1h151ro/1_month_postflox_healing/,1 month post-flox healing,"It’s been a month since I got an adverse reaction to 1 pill of Moxi. I want to post so this might be useful to someone on their first week or who is feeling desperate.

**Background**

Athletic female in mid-30s. Clean eating and healthy lifestyle. Lifting heavy in a gym 3 times a week, high magnesium intake on a daily basis, was on a mass gain before floxing.

**Floxing**

1 pill of Moxi, reaction within 1 hour, numbness in my feet and hands, panic attack, and out-of-body experience. Waited for 7 hours and called an ambulance when I felt that breathing became difficult.

I was treated in ER with prednisone, which immediately removed a panic attack and I felt that I was back to my body. Didn’t continue a prednisone prescription after reading posts in this subreddit.

**1****^(st)** **week**

Took a sick leave from work. Pain in my arms, numbness in my fingers, heavy feet, pain in my knees. Felt weak, no appetite. Forced myself eating since day 3, went on low calories with high protein intake to preserve muscles.

Took supplements: Magnesium 500 mg, Zinc 15 mg, Vitamin D 50 mg, Vitamin C 500 mg, NAC, Q10.

On day 7 felt that I was more myself, my body started feeling like it was back to its strength, and got my appetite back.

Walked 3k steps and increased until 8-9k at the end of the week.

Tingling in my feet and fingers persisted, pain in my arms during evenings.

**2-3rd weeks**

Went to work. Was able to do elaborate things that require a precision during the day. Happy that I can work.

Started taking Doxy due to my original infection coming back. Stopped all supplements, as they might interact with Doxy, and didn’t feel worse.

At the end of the second week went to a swimming pool, had a swim for 30 min without any problem.

Feel pins and needles on my fingers every second night.  Occasional light pain in my feet.

Walk 8-10k steps a day.

**4****^(th)** **week**

Finished my Doxy prescription, and went back on supplements.

Tried coffee, got a flare-up with tingling and pain in the arms the same evening, and couldn’t sleep during the night. Suspect that it might be also curcuma tea during the day, or Q10. Resolved within 24 hours.

Get nightmares a few times a week, but I am used to them, don’t impact me that much, I just acknowledge that my neurochemicals are not balanced yet.

Went to swim 2 times for 35 min + added 30 min of aqua aerobics after.

Walk 8-10k steps a day.

**Overall**

A month later I can almost do everything before pre-flox. I avoid alcohol, and caffeine and sleep 10-11 hours a day. Eat even cleaner than before. Introduced more greens, lentils, and beans. I plan on introducing light gym exercise in December and see if my body can handle it.

I lost 2 kilos, mainly it’s water, as I reduced carbs and my muscles are less defined, but they are there.

**Helpful things**

A positive mindset. Extremely helpful. People around me panicked more than me. I was calm and embraced a new reality and tried to rest, watch new movies, to do hobbies that I don’t have time for usually. I stopped my crazy gym routines that I missed a bit, but it gave me more time to reconnect with myself. I have this internal feeling that I will be alright. I communicate with my body and am grateful to it that it does such a great job. The reality has changed, but it made me to appreciate my body and my everyday life much more than before.

Breathing techniques from a Wim Hof method and cold shower exposure. Helped enormously at the beginning to clear my mind and feel that my body is alive.

Sauna. I have a sauna 2 times a week at least and my body loves it.

Clean eating and drinking plenty of water. I counted calories for a few years already, and it was extremely helpful to go on low calories but maintain a high protein intake and have balanced fats coming from salmon, nuts, and seeds. I would say that it’s a key to help your body to provide it with rich and macro-dense foods.

I know I am not out of the woods yet, but I have a positive mindset that I am going to be alright and as many people point out listening to your body is the best that I can do.

1h15195,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1h15195/physical_mirroring/,Physical mirroring?,"Not sure what to call this. I have an 11 year old son and very often (not always, but in many instances) a minor physical injury or ailment will manifest in both of us at the same time. For example, on Thursday, he was at an evening event and fell hard while chasing a hayride. I was at home, and tripped and fell into the coffee table. When I picked him up a bit later he was eager to show me his bruised and swollen left knee and scraped right elbow. I had the same bruises/ scrapes in the same places. This happens all the time.

A couple of weeks ago I burned my thumb on a hot glue gun, resulting in a blister. A few days later he showed me a blister on his own thumb. Pulled muscles, bug bites, canker sores, stubbed toes...all minor, random incidents with visible identical manifestations or comparable evidence have been consistent for as long as I can remember. It would make sense if the event causing the mark happened in each other's presence - maybe one of us subconsciously imitated the other. Or if it was environmental, like allergies or a sunburn. Or something contagious like a cold or fever, or a hereditary symptom (well, other than clumsiness, lol). But these examples do not fall into a pattern like that.

Anyone have a similar, persistent experience?",1,1732716252.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1h14zt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1h14zt1/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 27/11/2024**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1h14zda,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingErgonomic/comments/1h14zda/saddle_up_for_comfort_my_journey_with_an/,Saddle Up for Comfort: My Journey with an Ergonomic Saddle Chair,"## A Deep Dive into the Ups and Downs of My Backrest Adventure

Ever felt like your regular office chair is as comfortable as sitting on a stack of bricks? That's how I used to feel, until I discovered the ergonomic saddle chair with a backrest. This wasn't just a chair; it was a game-changer. Let me take you on my journey, from skeptic to convert, as I explore the ins and outs of this unique seating solution.
  
  
## First Impressions

The first time I laid eyes on the ergonomic saddle chair, I thought, “What in the world is that?” It looked like a mix between a horse saddle and a futuristic throne. Seriously, I half-expected a knight to trot in and claim it as his own. The unique design immediately caught my attention. Instead of the usual four-legged, cushy office chair, this one had a sleek, minimalist vibe that screamed, “I mean business!” 

When I finally sat on it, I was hit with a wave of surprise. At first, it felt a bit wobbly, like I was trying to balance on a seesaw. But then, as I shifted my weight, it began to mold to my shape. I could feel my spine aligning in a way that my old chair never managed. I had always thought that comfort came from plush cushions, but this chair was proving me wrong. 

I had my doubts about how this saddle design could actually support me. Would it be like sitting on a rock? But as I adjusted to the chair, I realized it was designed to encourage good posture. It felt like my body was finally getting the support it craved. Who knew a chair could be so revolutionary?

## Understanding the Science Behind the Saddle

Saddle chairs are not just quirky furniture; they’re like magic for your back! These unique seats are designed based on some pretty smart science that focuses on how our bodies work best. When you sit on one, it encourages your body to adopt a posture that’s more natural. You know that slouchy position we all fall into after a few hours of scrolling through TikTok? Yeah, that’s the one we want to avoid.

The saddle chair promotes a hip angle that’s open and relaxed, which can help keep your spine in a neutral position. This means less strain on your lower back. Imagine your spine as a tower of blocks; if the bottom blocks are leaning, the whole tower is at risk of toppling over. A study published in the _Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation_ found that using ergonomic seating can significantly reduce lower back discomfort. Isn’t that wild? 

I once chatted with a physical therapist who explained that when we sit in a more upright position, it reduces pressure on our intervertebral discs. It’s like giving your back a little vacation! Plus, the saddle shape encourages movement, which can be a game changer. So, saddle up, my friends; your back will thank you!

## Getting Used to the Saddle

Adjusting to an ergonomic saddle chair was like learning to ride a bike all over again—exciting yet a bit wobbly. At first, I felt like a newborn giraffe, trying to find my balance. The unique shape of the chair was a whole new world for my backside. I mean, who knew a chair could feel so… different? The first few days were a bit rough. My legs would slide out from under me, and I’d find myself teetering like I was on a rollercoaster. I had to remind myself that it was all part of the learning curve. 

Finding the right position was another challenge. It felt like a game of Goldilocks—this height was too high, that angle was too low. I experimented with the backrest, adjusting it until I felt snug yet supported. A tip that helped was to keep my feet flat on the ground. It sounds simple, but having my feet planted made a world of difference. 

I also discovered that taking breaks was essential. Standing up, stretching, and giving my back a little love helped me get used to the saddle chair. It’s like giving my body a mini vacation! So, if you’re thinking of making the switch, don’t fret. Embrace the journey, and soon enough, you’ll be riding smoothly.

## The Backrest: A Game-Changer

When I first hopped onto my ergonomic saddle chair, I felt like a cowboy on a wild stallion, ready to ride into the sunset. But let’s be real, the backrest was the unsung hero of this whole experience. You see, when you’re new to saddle chairs, it’s easy to underestimate the importance of having a good backrest. It’s like trying to drive a car without a seatbelt—sure, you can do it, but why would you want to?

The backrest is essential because it cradles your spine, helping you sit up straight and stay comfy for hours. I remember the first few days of using the chair; my back would start to feel like a pretzel after just a short while. Then, I adjusted the backrest, and boom! It was like someone had waved a magic wand over my posture. Suddenly, I was no longer slumping like a sad sack; I was sitting tall, feeling like a champion. 

Proper spine alignment is crucial, especially if you spend long hours sitting. A good backrest helps distribute your weight evenly, reducing pressure on your lower back. It’s like having a supportive friend behind you, cheering you on. So, if you’re diving into the world of saddle chairs, don’t overlook the backrest. Trust me, it’s a game-changer!

## Saddle Chairs in Action: A Day in the Life

Sitting in my ergonomic saddle chair feels like a mini adventure every workday. Picture this: I roll out of bed, still half-asleep, and plop down on this funky-looking seat that’s supposed to make my back sing with joy. At first, I thought, “What on earth is this? A chair or a horse?” But let me tell you, once I settled in, it was like discovering a hidden treasure.

As I dive into my work, I notice that my focus sharpens. Unlike my old chair, which felt like a cozy, but slightly oppressive, hug, this saddle chair encourages me to sit up straight. I mean, who knew sitting could be an active sport? My legs are spread out, and I can feel my core engaging. It’s like my body is saying, “Hey, we’ve got work to do!” 

When I switch tasks—from typing up reports to brainstorming ideas—the saddle chair keeps me energized. I’ve even found that I can swivel around to grab my coffee without losing my groove. It’s a game-changer! 

Now, don’t get me wrong, there are moments when I miss the plush comfort of a regular chair, especially during those long meetings. But overall, my productivity has soared. I’m more focused, less fidgety, and my back? Well, it’s finally on my side.

## The Long-Term Effects

Using an ergonomic saddle chair has been like discovering a hidden treasure chest in my office. Seriously, I used to think all chairs were created equal. Oh, how wrong I was! After spending months perched on this beauty, I can confidently say it’s transformed my daily grind into something surprisingly pleasant. 

First off, let’s talk posture. I used to slouch like a wilted flower by noon. Now, I sit up straight, feeling like a proud peacock. My back no longer screams at me after a long workday. In fact, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in back pain. I mean, who knew that a chair could be a game changer? It’s like I’ve traded in my old, creaky office chair for a throne fit for royalty! 

And it’s not just my back that’s benefited. My mood has taken a turn for the better, too. With less pain comes more energy. I find myself more focused and productive, which means fewer coffee breaks and more time actually getting stuff done. Who knew a chair could affect my vibe so much?

So, my perspective on office chairs has completely flipped. Now, I see them as vital tools for well-being rather than just furniture. It’s amazing how something as simple as a chair can make such a difference!

## Conclusions
  
  
After months of using my ergonomic saddle chair with a backrest, I can confidently say it's more than just a chair; it's an investment in my comfort and health. While it took some getting used to, the benefits have been undeniable. So, if you're tired of the brick-like chairs and curious about the saddle life, I say, go ahead, take a seat.

1h14z85,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h14z85,AIO for thinking this way about my roommate,"I moved into a new place in early November, and one of my two roommates has been living here with me since then. Our third roommate is set to arrive in about a week, so it’s just been the two of us for a few weeks now.

At first, things were going decent in terms of cleanliness. I noticed my roommate has some different habits—like not pushing his chair back in after using the dining table, leaving crumbs around, and not really pitching in with cleaning tasks. I’ve been the one vacuuming, dusting, wiping surfaces, and even replacing the toilet paper every time.  But it’s really not that bad. He’s nowhere near being a slob.  I’ve lived with a slob before.

Then, about a week ago, his friend came to stay, and things got worse. She has the same habits as him—just amplified.

The dishes situation has especially gone downhill. What used to be a couple of coffee mugs or plates left out for half a day has now turned into dishes sitting overnight and into the next morning. This morning, I walked into the kitchen to find it in a mess, and it made getting ready for work frustrating. I wasn’t even planning to make a big breakfast, but I still had to move their dirty dishes around just to wash my own and clean the sink. It didn’t take long, but it was one of those moments that made me sigh.

I ended up texting him (immediately, maybe a little too early) and said, “Brother, I just ask you to pick up after yourself. It’s tough for me getting ready for work in the morning and finding the kitchen a disaster.”

Am I overreacting? Is the kitchen really a “disaster,” or am I just being OCD about all of this? I know they eventually clean up 80% (because I handle the other 20% with dusting, wiping, and other cleaning anyway).  But please do let me know if I just need to relax.",1,1732716096.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!**

We love this thing and we’ve tolerated most of the quirks. 

But I know it won’t last forever and I’ve been eying the Spinn 2 because it improves on some of our key problems.

We’re mostly large cup coffee drinkers, so the larger brews are nice. We’re mostly dark roast, so the improved hopper drop mechanism is nice. I like the swappable hoppers so it’s easier to have variety day to day. And geek mode would be nice (although for the life of me I don’t understand why it won’t let us load a generic light/medium/medium dark/dark recipe when it doesn’t have our bag registered or why it won’t load your new bag when you add one for them). 

But at this point I’m worried my Spinn 1 won’t last until Spinn 2 ships in July 2025 (or more realistically Christmas 2025)

I’ve always been frustrated with the Ferrari maintenance costs of this delicate machine that requires like 20% of its retail price in annual maintenance if you’re following their clean/descale/filter schedule.

Off and on over the years it will drip constantly until it overflows and floods the counter so it permanently lives on a towel. 

We had it completely die once and got a comped RMA by an exceedingly kind and generous customer service agent. 

But now it’s both dripping regularly and half of each coffee cup is ending up in the grind hopper. I’ve run 3 cleaning cycles and contacted customer service but ultimately they just want to pull $200 from me to fix their I guess poorly designed or simply delicate machine. 


So now I sit? Emotionally wanting to buy the upgrade and keep this company in business, but rationally I feel like my current machine won’t last, they won’t support me, and then I’m buying a machine twice as expensive (for me) that will only last a couple years again. 

What I’d really like to see is them acknowledging they’re a small company that wants a happy customer base, and give us repair manuals when our device is out of service. Sell parts. And tell us what off the shelf cleaning products we can use cause I dislike the secret maintenance costs feeling like their intended profit center all along.

I really want this company to survive, but they’re making it hard for me to help. ",2,1732715968.0,SpinnCoffee,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the Bose TV Speaker, and I have to say, it's a game-changer for TV audio. This compact soundbar packs a punch, delivering clear and immersive sound that brings movies and shows to life.

I was impressed by how easy it was to set up. In just minutes, I had it connected to my TV and was enjoying improved audio. The dialogue mode is a standout feature, making voices crisp and easy to understand. It's perfect for those times when I struggle to catch every word.

https://preview.redd.it/jftbqery9g3e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f64f1516d8af1f7cdfa471990131db272496f0ab

The Bluetooth function is a nice bonus. I can easily stream music from my phone, turning the soundbar into a versatile audio device. While it's not a full surround sound system, it's a big step up from built-in TV speakers.

One thing to note is the remote. It's simple, which some might like, but I found the buttons a bit hard to see in low light. Still, the soundbar's performance more than makes up for this small issue.

# Bottom Line

If you want to boost your TV's audio without breaking the bank, the Bose TV Speaker is a solid choice. It's easy to use, sounds great, and takes up little space.



# Overview: Bose TV Speaker - A Compact Powerhouse

I recently got my hands on the Bose TV Speaker, and I'm impressed by its performance. This small soundbar packs a punch, delivering clear audio that enhances TV viewing.

# Elevating Your TV Experience

The Bose TV Speaker makes a big difference in how I enjoy my shows. Its two angled drivers create wide, spacious sound. The center tweeter focuses on vocals, making dialogue easier to understand. I found the Dolby decoding feature adds depth to the audio, making my viewing more immersive.

I like that I can boost the bass or use dialogue mode with the remote. These options let me adjust the sound to fit what I'm watching. For music lovers, the Bluetooth feature is a nice touch. I can easily stream tunes from my phone through the speaker.

# Simplicity in Design and Use

Setting up the Bose TV Speaker was a breeze. I just plugged it in using the included optical cable, and it was ready to go. At just over 2 inches tall, it fits neatly in front of my TV without blocking the screen.

The small LED lights on the front are helpful. They change color to show which features are on and blink to confirm volume changes. I appreciate that the speaker works with my TV remote when connected via HDMI, so I don't need an extra remote cluttering my coffee table.

While the sound quality is great for its size, bass lovers might want more oomph. Luckily, I can add a Bose subwoofer if I want to beef up the low end in the future.

# Clarity of Speech

Speech clarity is a standout feature of this Bose TV speaker. I noticed a big improvement in dialogue quality compared to my TV's built-in speakers. Voices sound crisp and clear, making it easier to catch every word of my favorite shows and movies. The speaker has a special dialogue mode that boosts speech even more. This is really helpful for quieter scenes or when characters are whispering. While it's not perfect, I found I rarely needed to rewind or turn on subtitles to understand what was being said. For its size and price, the Bose delivers solid vocal clarity that enhances the viewing experience.

# Wireless Streaming

I found the Bluetooth connectivity on this compact speaker to be a standout feature. It's simple to pair my phone and stream music or podcasts wirelessly. The Bose TV Speaker can remember up to 3 devices, which is handy for switching between my phone, tablet, and laptop. I was impressed by the 30-foot range - I could keep my device in another room without issues. The sound quality for music streaming is good, though not quite as rich as when used for TV audio. Still, it's a nice bonus to have a multi-purpose speaker that works well for both TV and music.

# Seamless Setup

Setting up this compact soundbar was a breeze. I simply plugged in the optical cable that came with it to my TV, and I was good to go in minutes. The process was quick and easy, with no complicated steps or extra equipment needed. For those who prefer HDMI, that's an option too, though you'll need to buy the cable separately. The remote control that comes with the speaker is straightforward and user-friendly. I found it simple to adjust settings and switch between modes. The speaker's small size made placement a snap - it fit perfectly in front of my TV without blocking the screen.

# Pros and Cons

Sound quality can make or break the TV viewing experience. After using this compact Bose speaker, I've noticed some clear advantages and drawbacks.

# Pros

* Clear dialogue: The speaker enhances vocals, making it easier to catch every word.
* Easy setup: I had it up and running in minutes with a single cable.
* Compact size: At just over 2 inches tall, it fits neatly in front of my TV.
* Bluetooth: I can stream music from my phone when I'm not watching TV.
* Remote control: The included remote lets me adjust settings quickly.

# Cons

* Limited bass: While it improves on TV speakers, it lacks the deep bass of larger systems.
* No surround sound: The audio is better than TV speakers but doesn't create a full surround effect.
* Basic remote: The buttons on the remote can be hard to see and use.
* Price: It costs more than some soundbars that include a subwoofer.

I found the Bose TV Speaker to be a solid upgrade from built-in TV audio. It shines in dialogue clarity and ease of use. The small size is perfect for my space, and I like that I can use it for music too. But if you're after booming bass or a full home theater experience, you might want to look at bigger systems. For most TV watching, though, it does the job well.

# Customer Reviews and Ratings

I checked out what other buyers had to say about this Bose soundbar. It has an impressive 4.3-star rating from over 11,700 reviews. Many users praise the improved sound quality compared to their TV speakers. They note clearer dialogue and better overall audio. Some mention it's easy to set up and use. A few had minor issues with the remote or connectivity. But most seem happy with their purchase. Users like the broad sound range and crisp audio. Some say it creates a theater-like experience at home. While not everyone finds it perfect, most agree it's a solid upgrade from built-in TV audio.

# Ease of Expansion

I found this Bose speaker quite flexible when it comes to expanding its capabilities. It's compatible with the Bose Bass Module 500 or 700, which can add more low-end punch if you want it. You'll need to buy a separate connection cable, but it's nice to have the option to beef up the bass later on. I like that I can start with just the soundbar and add more oomph if I feel the need. The speaker also has multiple input options - HDMI, optical, and AUX - so I can connect up to 3 devices at once. This lets me easily switch between my TV audio and music from my phone or tablet. While it doesn't offer full surround sound expansion, I think it provides good options for most people looking to improve their TV audio setup.

# Conclusion

The Bose TV Speaker is a solid choice for upgrading your TV audio. I found it easy to set up and use, with noticeable improvements in sound quality compared to built-in TV speakers. The clearer dialogue and enhanced volume were standout features. While not a full surround sound system, it provides good value for its price point. The remote could be better, but that's a minor issue. If you want a simple way to boost your TV audio without breaking the bank, this Bose soundbar is worth considering. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done for most viewers looking for clearer, fuller sound.",1,1732715910.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

$30 - exciting! While all of this continues to be promising for the continuity of our bullish uptrend over the next few weeks, I would say the principal question facing us in the short term is this: will $30 hold this week? Let's dive in and find out!

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading Day 11\/27 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ycz0gz1shf3e1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=8292a6e9a938510d85481ef4009b7f0ab521b0f2)

Yes, we had a day of uncommonly high options volume (versus the past five months of trading post Sneeze 2.0). Additionally, we spent most of our day well within the bounds of a deep bullish premium sentimental imbalance (>50%). This was at its highest during our initial climb through the $30 Call Wall. As the $30 Calls moved into the money, MM gamma and delta hedging shot the price rapidly, where it was buttressed by additional hedging pressure from the $31, $32, and $33 strikes where meaningful amounts of Call OI were established during Monday's trading. After an initial top at \~$31.65, price action cooled off into some low volume daytrading north of VWAP along the 50-min SMA until a forced VWAP/200-min SMA intersection touch stimulated a second heavy wave of options activity before the stock sold off to sub-$30 levels late in the day though ultimately closing above the key $30 mark.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[11\/29 OI Changes 11\/26-11\/27](https://preview.redd.it/jjjajiyfnf3e1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6ec79c18188fc38227c6ea415e7a12850e73d1)

As we take a look at our 11/29 OI we can see a continuation of that upward shift in our options trading window. Few Puts yesterday were traded at all - long or short - below $28, while new net Call OI didn't show up south of $30.50. Indeed, the new concentration of Call OI at strikes above $30 in our next $5 macrobracket is promising for our continued march north in subsequent trading weeks. Off-map, MMs likely enjoyed the thousands of contracts in sales at the far OTM strikes of $40, $45, $50, and the new $58 strike that tops out our chain. A sizable amount of new Put gamma showed up on the board as well of a mixed sentiment with a slight imbalance toward the BID (Put sales, so bullish trades). 

[12\/06 OI Changes 11\/26-11\/27](https://preview.redd.it/yoqvd6jpnf3e1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=18ed09b66376d6502e5c3771c2407cb4da691171)

As we take a look at next week's OI changes, we see a lot lighter activity on the Put side of things, indicating that the spike in Put Volume yesterday is primarily aimed to capture price and IV depreciation in the short term (inside of 11/29 expiry) rather than a larger move into next week. Call OI Changes for 12/06, however, show a stronger increase and converge (at least currently) on a trading structure that suggests a continuity of trading above and below a $30 pivot point. It will be important to monitor how this structure continues to develop on this short week.

As we take a look at our Max Pain numbers for the coming weeks, we can see that 12/06 Max Pain has moved up from $24-$25, 12/13 has moved to $24.50 from $24, and 12/27 has moved to $25 from $24 as a result of yesterday's trading. While projecting weekly closes close to this strike is less meaningful given the substantial imbalances toward Call OI, it is still a low resolution bullish signal to see Max Pain numbers shift higher and closer to our trading range.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/imszu4enpf3e1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d5a8a6fca8ecaf8a9626aabb90fe4522fa4ada

Our daily GEX Put-to-Call ratio remains bullish, but is comparatively lower to yesterday's 1:5 ratio. It is hard to project precise price movement on P/C GEX trends alone, but our adherence to the the 1:5-1:4 ratio range projects stability in our current paradigm.

https://preview.redd.it/yir74h4jpf3e1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b4c8fca4b6662a35fc637d9f4df8800bf7fede2

Our daily GEX chart heading into today's trading well illustrates how quickly our landscape can transform with some intraday options dynamism. Our strikes from $30.50 up through $33 all saw expansions of their net positive gamma character providing a hedging environment that 'catches' the price and suggests more stable trading in this range. This was responsible intraday yesterday for the price 'trap' above $30 and our assumption of our Call Wall as a downside support. 

At our current premarket price levels (trading around $31) and in light of the new Call Gamma structure above $30, our path of least resistance is to continue to trade stably within this $30-$33 bracket with $32 as a near-term ceiling. At the same time, the neutralization of strikes below $30 through increased Put Gamma also suggests we remain in the lower half of this new bracket.

But to our question - does our GEX data provide any insight into our likelihood to hold $30 this week?

We have some strong positive factors going for us in this regard:

1) Our penetration deeper up into the initial $32 area drew in a substantial amount of new Call Gamma into our strikes proximal to and above $30. This provides an upward 'pull' on our price as $30 is approached on a downward move at the same time that $30 provides a substantial upward 'push.' This could be a determining factor on this short week as we only have 1.5 trading days of options activity to rearrange the landscape further in such a way that would be conducive to slipping back below the $30 Call Wall.

2) Call Wall breaches on average bring bearish returns over a 1-Day period vs. the close on the day of the breach itself (S&P average move -7BP on a Call Wall breach). However, they provide bullish returns over a 5-Day period vs. the close on the day of the breach itself (S&P average move +5BP on a Call Wall breach).

Keeping in mind that these are averages and not destinies for individuals, our close at $30.30 yesterday suggests a close today at \~$29.90 and a close next Thursday at \~$30.60. While this doesn't give us specific insight as to whether Friday's close will end up above $30, this average price action over 5 trading days post Call Wall breach based on yesterday's closing price does suggest a majority of price action over that range to be occurring above $30. 

Based on these insights, I am therefore expecting a weekly close very near to $30, especially if we remain trading today above that mark with enough time for the $30 strike's charm to flip positive and act as yet another upward hedging pressure at that price level. At our recent high IV levels, MMs will still be making a lot of money off that Call position even if we get a close at something like $30.17.

**Technicals**

[10\/21-11\/27 4hr Aggregation Period](https://preview.redd.it/yfjnwlw54g3e1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b9f3a428b8c9252c50b12ff5bf2895baaad7719)

Returning to our $30 question and our still critically important trading channel on the 4hr chart, we also have retrace and consolidation suggested over the next 2-3 trading days. Our move over $31 yesterday took us right up into RSI Overbought territory (RSI >70) on our 4hr chart, which is a sell signal within our current trading paradigm. The speed of our typical regression within this channel suggests, as I concluded from my analysis of our market maker gamma hedging structure, that we close the week right ON $30 with some trading in our $30-$32 bracket today that ultimately closes diminutively closer to $30. This \*should\* just about pull our lower-bounding guiderail (the 50-4hr SMA) up to around $29.50-$30 where it would (prospectively) set up another intratrend reversal to the upside and allow another periodization to unfold as we prospectively move into the middle of our $30-$35 macrobracket and look to claim $32 as a floor.

[Nov 2021 - Nov 2024 Weekly Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/k4vcja0v6g3e1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7e71886d0c4611d52d92284a328bc8fb6bf1ab8)

As we zoom out a bit, it is worth taking into consideration that we are approaching an RSI Overbought signal on the weekly chart (Current Weekly RSI = 69.36). Thus, in projecting price movement into and out of earnings, I could see continuation of our bull trend into 12/10 earnings, followed by a 1-2 week general correction into 12/20 OPEX that consolidated atop the 200-week SMA (currently at $27.92). Interestingly, this moving average will move down over the next 2-3 weeks as the 2021 Sneeze candles are removed from the average. This may be reason enough for the mild correction and, should we get our 2-week earnings IV run-up, would allow bearish traders to profit off a price reversal and IV dip, only to re-enter their positions on a resumption of the trend in late December, potentially something like what we saw in December 2020:

[Nov 2020-Jan 2021 Pre-Sneeze Weekly Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/wglzixkm8g3e1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fa92ec1bffa0af354e0072f6694af4e7cb726c)

What appears to have caused the quick reversal back to the upside post-earnings 2020 was of course Cohen's filings around Dec 17. After this occurred, GME's weekly RSI moved deep into overbought territory and bobbed its way in and out all the way into the Sneeze in later Jan 2021. 

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/vaiyxgojjf3e1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=c767abda32f611a37e34dac69b93bfb800434a36

With our Q3 Earnings report now officially announced by the Company to be released after market hours on 12/10 (contrary to brokerage 'estimates' as anticipated) we are now T-13 Calendar days to release. As we can see in the 5-year, 10-day Mean IV chart above, GME like many stocks has featured a two-week long IV appreciation period that has preceded earnings only to 'thump' down hard immediately following. Following the Sneeze in 2021, this resulted in a major disruption of this pattern that did not resume until the Q4 Earnings release period in March 2023. It has continued every quarter since then in unbroken regularity - including for Q1 2024 Earnings which covered the period of the 2nd spike after RK's return in June. We saw the same pattern emerge immediately after the company announced the Q2 Earnings report on August 27. IV began to appreciate slowly, moving from a low of around 70%  (Schwab valuation) to an intraday high in excess of 140% before immediately thumping back down to just above its previous low over a mere two trading days.

We find ourselves in a different position presently, as our IV has appreciated steadily and almost achieved our local Sept 10 high prior to the Q2 Earnings release. Despite our price appreciation, IV has flattened out in its appreciative curve over the past few weeks. However, it will be important to monitor whether this IV effect plays out as it has for previous quarters. If IV gets extremely high, it could cause a decent volume of options sales coming out of the Q3 earnings report (unless there is some big news to counter this and drive buying enthusiasm even more). 

I am monitoring this situation and will provide thoughts as we see the trend play out over the next two weeks.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Trading in the $30-$32 range is likely for today given the new Call GEX above $30 opened yesterday. A cool off in the immediate term is likely with a weekly close on this short week around $30. Our bull trend, however, is intact, and will likely continue into the $30-$35 range over the next two weeks, though a mild correction following earnings is possible. We will have to observe closely how things develop day-by-day. There will be plenty to keep our eyes on.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

I am looking because my current workplace is not doing well financially and I am potentially having a kid next year. 

There are a few things im not sure about, one is that I have two jobs in the last 9 years,  one was at a very formal financial company (suit everyday) and the other is at a gaming studio (remote, super chill environemnt) and i'm worried that both of these experiences are like cancelling each other out. The hip places dont want me because of my formal experience and the formal places see a gaming studio and dont know what to do with it. 

The other issue (not really an issue) is that i was promoted a lot and very quickly at my first place. I went from HR contract intern to HR Manager in 5 years, and I dont want to split the jobs up and have them all say the same location so I just list it as such and note its progressive experience, but then they dont know how long I was a manager for. 

Im also looking to add a designation while i still have a job, i've done a lot of HR project management with HRIS systems, org restructuring, intranet launch that would apply for PMP, but I also see a lot more compensation jobs open and I feel like its an interesting part of the business i have experience in. SO my choices are PMP or a Compensation accreditation. Not sure which is better.

1h14tt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipsOver35/comments/1h14tt4/struggling_to_understand_what_went_wrong_feeling/,"Struggling to understand what went wrong, feeling heartbroken ","Im struggling with a breakup that happened recently, and I’m finding it really hard to move forward. I thought me (31F) and this guy (33M) had something special, and I genuinely believed we were building towards a future together. Now it’s over, and I’m left heartbroken, questioning everything.

We met a couple months ago on a dating app, and despite being in different cities, we hit it off quickly. Our conversations were deep, fun, and we connected on so many important levels—values, future goals, religion, and lifestyle. He told me early on that he felt something for me that he hadn’t felt in a long time. He said he was falling for me, could see a future with me, and even mentioned marriage and getting me a ring someday. He told his family and friends about me, and everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction. He said he could see me as his wife and we even talked about kids. It was fast but it felt right. He wasn’t long (3-4 months) out of a relationship and I said this was a concern of me but he insisted he was over it and ready to move on although he didn’t expect to connect with someone so quickly. 

Almost two weeks ago, he visited me in my city for the first time, and it felt like an important step. We spent a few days together, it went so well. We connected just as well in person I felt. I did notice that a couple days ater he left, he seemed a little more distant. Communication started to shift slightly—I felt he wasn’t as responsive or emotionally engaged as before. I assumed it was due to work stress or exhaustion because I knew he had a lot on and was working late shifts, so I didn’t push. I also held back from asking too many questions because I didn’t want to seem needy or pressure him or assume small changes were related to us when he was busy. 

Now, I’m preparing to move to his city very soon (something we had talked about and were both excited about initially). We had a call about it just over a week ago and his tone seemed different. He said he wanted to be sensible and take things slow- which I agreed with- but he never really spoke like that before. He said he was still interested and wanted to spend time together but he didn’t sound excited. Again, I put it down to tiredness and a busy schedule. I asked if anything specific was worrying him and he said no.  But a few days later, he called me and said he didn’t think it would work between us. He mentioned he felt that certain “functional” aspects of our communication weren’t working and that we might be too similar in some ways. I didn’t ask him to elaborate on the similar part. I told him I noticed a change but put it down to the factors I mentioned before. I said I thought we could work through it and use as a way to learn more about each other and how we like to communicate. When I asked if we could give it more time to figure things out, he said no and seemed pretty resigned in his decision that it wouldn’t work. I feel I mishandled the call, I didn’t get angry or anything but I was upset and feel I interrupted him a few times which I did apologise for. I asked how he could do this when he told me he loved me, it felt like he was throwing it away. He said he spent a year with his ex trying to make things work and didn’t want to have to convince himself again when he felt strongly like it wouldn’t work. It’s hard for me to understand how he felt so strongly it wouldn’t work when so recently he told me he was crazy about me. We talked about how we would handle things and I told him to let me know if there were things he needed so it’s hard for me to reconcile this.

The next day, I sent him a message to clarify my thoughts, thanking him for being honest and acknowledging his perspective, but I can’t stop wondering if there was more to it. I again said I was open to working through things. He didn’t articulate any specific issues until the breakup, and I’m struggling to understand how things could go from talking about a future together to him walking away so suddenly.

I keep thinking about all the little things. The conversations continued after he went back but I did feel a shift in excitement or how forthcoming he was with emotions. The topics were more day to day things but we still had phone calls most days even though I felt he sometimes cut them short. He also fell asleep early some nights so texting stopped abruptly until the next morning. I think having more day to day conversations doesn’t have to be a bad thing though.

I’ve also noticed that he removed me from a fitness tracker we were connected on and either unmatched me on the dating app or deactivated his account (I think deactivated), but he’s still following me on Instagram. I don’t know what to make of that—it feels like he’s moved on quickly, and I’m left feeling stuck.

I guess im not sure what I’m hoping for but maybe I’m looking for some outside perspective. 
I feel so heartbroken, and it’s hard to imagine moving to a new city and starting fresh while still carrying all these emotions. I didn’t really articulate just how upset I am to him. i am hoping he reaches out again as my feelings were real. I’m also tempted to reach out to him when I move and maybe ask if he wanted to get coffee but I really don’t know if that’s the right thing to do.",1,1732715683.0,RelationshipsOver35,0,1.0,False

My husband and I own a cafe (coffee shop). We have a customer who comes in frequently. She is foreign and very wealthy, which I believe contributes to this problem. Basically she is very courteous to myself and my husband, and well behaved in front of us. But when we are not there she is very rude and difficult to our staff. She is demanding, complains, asks for special treatment/off menu items, and generally treats them badly. I'm not positive of this but my sense is she considers them servants- that's the vibe my staff gets from her. Meanwhile, she brings my husband and I gifts from her home country, asks after us, and even made us dinner once after I had surgery. Another aspect is that she has brought us a lot of customers from her immigrant community, which we are grateful for.  Since she behaves differently in front of my husband and I we have never witnessed this bad behavior from her. Most of our staff have been with us for years and are very professional so we believe their accounts completely.

  
Recently she apparently berated one of our newer staff members over some issue and nearly brought her to tears. We are kind of at a loss how to proceed here. How do we confront her about something we've never personally witnessed? How do I tell her ""hey you have to treat my staff like human beings, they are not your servants"", in a way that will get through? My sense is part of this issue is cultural so I have no idea if she would even get what we're saying. There's also a bit of a language barrier, which adds to the difficulty. She's recently been reaching out on social media to complain about our newer staff, so this does seem to be escalating.

1h14ktq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1h14ktq/art_is_dead_but_god_isnt/,Art is dead (but God isn't),"Real Art is a dark and satirical look about the modern art scene. For those who are squeamish, there is violence (though it's mostly suggested than explained in explicit detail).

  
Real Art



“What do you see? Do you see an installation? Is that what’s written on your flier? You have the right to call it that, just as you have the right to be wrong. This is my practice. My practice explores reluctance in the process of decision-making. See the object and observe that it is neither the object of objecthood nor the object presently presenting itself as the code art-object. What you see is merely the object of my intentions, but how could you ever possibly comprehend that?”

The object of intentions in question is a broken broom handle puncturing a sheet of graph paper. The fractured stick punctures the paper, implanting it into the wall. On the bottom right-hand corner of the paper is the word *what* scratched out, replaced by the word *why*.

“These sculptures represent the sensation of nihilation, the phenomenon of non-being felt by those who feel being while being observed by those who cannot distinguish being from non-being. Art represents the void of nihilation by letting the viewer know how it feels to be viewed by those who cannot.”

This work consists of a series of rocks of various sizes placed atop one another. On the topmost rocks, googly eyes have been attached, and blindfolds have been placed over them.

The next piece doesn't have the artist to provide commentary on the intentions behind the work. Merely, a nude man of average build and appearance sits on a stool. His eyes are wide open. Those in attendance think perhaps the artist is the object and, like those street performers who paint themselves up in gold or chrome can stay in one position for hours, this artist is attempting the same thing here.

“How trite,” says one of the observers.

“I guess they’ll just put anything in here and call it art.”

Among them, one considers defending the piece, scouring the recesses of her brain to find a suitable comparison, even if it is only faint flattery, but she comes up empty. They stare at it just to say they didn't overlook a single object in the gallery and move on, only to be stopped in their tracks by a ghastly squeal.

A woman is screaming bloody murder after a security guard has entered to take a look at the piece. The security guard touches the naked man, only for his head to fall off. The body tilts to the side, and the torso falls off next, leaving only the bare legs and bottom still seated on the stool.

Seirbheis Phoilis na h-Alba arrive on the scene— a constable and his sergeant. The body is relatively fresh. It had been placed there during the night, and whoever did it managed the operation without setting off any alarms or leaving any signs of breaking and entering. The perpetrator positioned the body in such a way that it'd remain stable so long as it wasn't moved or touched after being placed in its seated position. The constable and sergeant prove unnecessary in identifying the body, as gallery curator Collin MacFadden recognizes the mutilated corpse right away.

“Oh Jesus, it’s only bloody Graham,” he says.

“Who’s that then?” asks Sergeant MacIntyre.

“If you’ll allow me to speak ill of the dead, he was a right twat, but he was one of the best artists our gallery has ever worked with,” says Collin.

“Would you say then, the deceased being as you described and all, someone may have disliked him enough to kill him?”

“Oh, plenty disliked him enough to kill him. That doesn’t narrow it down much. It could have been anyone,” says Collin.

But it couldn't have been anyone. The Artist was right there, watching the constables waste their time looking for evidence that would never lead them to anything. The Artist wasn't surprised when the media didn't show any of the imagery, but he still reserved the right to be annoyed. People would forget about the installation within a week of the next news cycle. The next piece he'd have to present in such a way it'd be impossible for the public to ignore.

Worse than not showing his work on the telly, the reporters were playing at make-believe and throwing wild guesses around as to the motive. The Artist had no motive beyond enjoying the shape of Graham's neck and head and the desire to push the boundaries of art. With others, the cuts would have required more work and, therefore, been rather time-consuming. Graham's body was as close to perfect as the model the Artist had created in his early sketches. Perhaps the next installation would have to be someone of a higher standing. The piece revolving around Graham, titled ""Heads, shoulders, knees, and toes"", was never actually meant to be the Artist's first installation; the first installation is something that had been brewing within him for years now, but he knew the effort and time might also mean it'd be his last installation, so he chose Graham to get the art out of his system. At the same time, he pondered on how to approach the actual piece of his ambition. That's just the way things go with art. Whether they be filmmakers, novelists, or what have you, they will inevitably have to put their original ambition on hold while they toy around and experiment with less taxing things first to get their beaks wet.

All Kenny wants to do is grab a nosh, but some twats decided to put up a bloody tarp in the middle of Buchanan Street, forcing all foot traffic to traverse around the tarp in a tight corridor. On a good day, walking through Buchanan Street was like crossing a minefield, but now it's as if the mines are magnetized and directly seeking each other out. If he ever found the villain who set up the damn tarp…

Kenny was unable to fully enjoy his nosh, still thinking about the bastard who blocked the footpath with his tarp. He was mostly over it after getting pissed with his mates. He loves stumbling home at night after getting pissed. Especially when the air is cool, and he can hear the voices of people enjoying the nightlife. Despite occasional blacking out, he knows he'll always make it home. All he has to do is go straight except at the bloody tarp. Instinctually, he moves to the right to avoid the tarp, but the tarp is gone. He's ready to move on with his life, but he looks up.

“Bloody hell, am I at fucking Epcot Center?” he rubs his eyes.

Some dork has set up one of those whatchamacallits? An animatronic?  It's some guy suspended by strings like a goofy marionette, but rather than just dangle over the pavement; his body pulls apart and then contracts, reassembling. It's like an accordion but made from a puppet man. The body pulls apart layer by layer, skin coming off to reveal muscle, flesh, and bones coming apart to reveal organs, and then being put back together. Bloody hell, it's bloody disgusting. Did they really have to add all the organs and innards to this muppet? And what's that smell? People start screaming. Also, isn't that, blimey, who is that, it's only bloody—

“Collin MacFadden,” says Sergeant MacIntyre, looking at the suspended body expanding to reveal the innards and contracting to become whole again.

“Who’s that then?” says Constable Thewlis.

""Get a grip, boy; we only talked to him, not a fortnight past. The bloody curator.""

“Right,” says Thewlis. “Fuck me, think it’s the same bloke?”

“Hell of a coincidence if it wasn’t. One thing’s for certain, this one will definitely give the wanker the publicity he’s been after.”

The Artist is coming home from an installation. It was in some loft above a pretentious coffee shop. It was one of those exhibits where none of the art displayed on the wall was the actual art. Rather, snippets, frames, or what have you were posted on the wall with brief descriptions and a QR code. To access the true vision of the artist, you scan the QR code, and it shows you the animation in motion. Drivel. Perhaps it's a commentary on how art is becoming commodified and how QR codes are an invasive species changing every aspect of our daily lives, or maybe it really was just drivel.

The Artist stops at Greggs for a Steak Bake. The cashier has an appealing Adam's apple, though his arm hair is coarse and off-putting. A commotion on the street calls his attention away from his Steak Bake. This happens to several others as they leave their food on the counter and rush outside to see what all the fuss is about.

Not five metres from where the Artist went public two weeks ago, there is a new art installation. It is simple—the word *hello*, all in lowercase letters. The long vertical part of the *h* is comprised of a nude man standing erect, while the curved part of the *h* is another nude man bent over, touching his toes. That in and of itself isn't so remarkable; what's remarkable is it looks like the two men's bodies have been fused together; there is no indication of where one body begins and the other ends. There are also no apparent incisions or imperfections. Absolutely seamless. The rest of the word is spelled out with nude men, their bodies connected. The craftsmanship is impeccable. Why *hello*? Was this person talking to the Artist?

The news accredited the piece to the Artist, which greatly upset him. Not because he saw himself as better than the piece; he did not. In fact, he believed himself to be its biggest admirer. But the last thing he wants to do is take credit for another artist's work. Whoever these geniuses were that concluded he had created this message clearly didn't understand the craftsmanship behind it. The Artist considers this: did this other artist intend for this to happen? Are they hoping to see how he reacts? Is it an invitation? A challenge? Yes, that's it, a challenge and an invitation—no more play time.

MacIntyre wakes up every morning with a start, just wondering what horrible grotesquery will be presented to him. He expected to see this kind of thing down there in London or Manchester but not in the civilized north. His appetite for his wife's cooking has diminished of late. Even tomatoes are starting to make him squeamish. Since the *hello* installation, foot patrols on pedestrian streets have doubled and a constable keeps constant watch at each intersection. Overnight security in museums and shopping centres was doubled, too.

When MacIntyre arrives on the scene at George Square, he thinks he has sufficiently mentally prepared himself. He hadn't. The newest piece is a rose, nearly perfectly shaped, if not for the fact that each red rose pedal was composed of a skinned torso. The rose stood at about five metres tall, with the stem made of spines stacked on top of one another with intestines wrapped around them. At the base of the stem was the phrase *hello to you too* written out in bones.

His suspicions that there is more than one artist at play are met with dismissal by his department. The idea of two wackos running around doing the same thing is too ludicrous for them to entertain. But the idea of one man having enough time and resources to not only commit the murders but carry out the installations without getting caught is what's ludicrous to MacIntyre.

On his way home, he encounters the ever-troublesome Mr. Waggstaff. A nice enough fellow but dreadfully dull, and if you don't force yourself away, he'll talk you to death and continue long after you're already in the grave.

""Evening, Mr. Waggstaff,"" he says, passing by.

“Evening Sergeant, how are ye?” asks the old man.

“Just fine, Mr. Waggstaff. Heading home to the missus, she’s getting tea ready.”

""I hate to trouble ye, Sergeant, I do, but if you can lend your ear for just a minute.""

“What is it then?”

“I can’t find me Douggie anywhere.”

“What’s happened then?”

""Nothing, far as I can tell.""

“Unusual indeed,” says MacIntyre.

Douggie is the old man’s Bull Terrier, nearly as old as Waggstaff himself, uglier than sin, but a loyal pup. The two are never seen separated.

“I’ll keep an eye out for your dog, don’t you worry,” says MacIntyre.

“Bless you, Sergeant, bless you.”

Mrs. MacIntyre is preparing pudding while Mr. MacIntyre flips through the telly. It’s hard to avoid news about all the art going around. He turns the telly off and notices just how quiet it is.

“What’s wrong with Sampson?” he asks.

""Nothing's wrong with him; I fed him,"" she responds from the kitchen.

""I'm sure you did, love; that's not what I asked. What I mean is, since when is the mutt this quiet?""

""Tonight's guests are two of the foremost art critics not just here in Scotland but in the UK. On my left is Jonathan January, writer for The Guardian, and on my right is Rollo Grande, writer for Vice and podcaster. In the past you two have had strikingly different views on what is and isn't art. Has that changed with the rise in what some are calling *Body-horror Art* from the artist dubbed The Horror of Glasgow?""

“I think it’s high time we stopped pretending this Glaswegian *enfant terrible* was an artist or that what they are producing is art. It’s not art, it’s anti-art, it’s the dark matter of art,” says January.

“Says the man who admittedly hasn’t looked at a single one of the Horror of Glasgow’s works,” responds Grande.

""There's nothing to admit. Admit suggests some guilt or shame or secrecy. I freely and proudly give my statement on the matter. Tell me you think Lowry is the epitome of high art without telling me Lowry is the epitome of high art.""

""Leave it to Jan over there to make a scathing critique dull. He's as obtuse as the art he claims to tear down as trite. One doesn't have to think art is good for it to be considered good art. We're critics, you know, not philosophers; it's our job to decide what is good and what isn't, not to wax philosophically on the trappings of meaning. You'd think that twenty-five years working for the *Guardian* you'd have learned some simple definitions by now.""

“I forgot that *Vice* only exists to promote rubbish like The Horror of Glasgow. You’re the same lot who thought dressing like Neon and Morbius was the epitome of cool and hip back when that film came out,” says January.

""First off, it's *Neo* and *Morpheus*. Secondly, anyone who's anyone would have read our think piece on why *The Matrix* isn’t only dated but wasn’t even good when it first came out.”

""Gentlemen,"" interjects Desmond, the host. But I must interrupt. We have word that commuters on the M8, at almost exactly the midpoint between Glasgow and Edinburgh, have discovered a new piece. I am warning viewers in advance to shut off your televisions if you are easily disturbed.""

There is a commotion on the side of the motorway. Cars are backed up as far as the eye can see, but rather than incessant honking and shouting, the scene has an eerie quietness. Everyone is looking in the same direction. The camera crew makes its way through the crowd to get a view of what's grabbed everyone's attention.

In a flat clearing, perhaps one hundred metres from the road is a sight that isn't quite comprehensible with one glance alone. If looked at with zero scrutiny, an observer would likely assume they were looking at a simple windmill. A windmill ten metres in height and rotating slowly with the breeze. But it isn't the sight that is striking, but the sound it produces. Each time the windmill completes a full rotation, it produces the sound of hundreds of hounds howling in fright. It is the most distressing collection of dog howls anyone has ever heard, but it only lasts a second, cutting through the air like a sharp blade. When it returns on the next rotation, it's just as piercing and spine-tingling. The windmill itself is composed of the bodies of several hundred canines. Just like the sign that said *hello* made out of human bodies, the bindings between dogs are so seamless it looks like the windmill is made of one solid object with no break in between the several hundred individual canines.

When investigators reach the scene, they can't ascertain what is making the dead canines howl in unison. Some gadget must have been inserted somewhere inside the mass of bodies that produces the sound, but without cutting the whole thing down, any guess is a needle in a haystack.

Among the victims are old man Waggstaff's Bull Terrier and Sergeant MacIntyre's beloved mutt. Public opinion starts to shift. Initially, online discourse regarding the Artist (most still thought there to be only one) was entirely possible. People saw it as the first real innovation in art in nearly a century. That all changed once the victims were dogs. Jonathan January, however, watches the footage and states: ""Now that's interesting.""

The Artist paces the length of his flat, back and forth, zig-zagging, sitting down, only to get up and start the process all over again.

“This guy is cheating,” he takes a sip of tea. It has no taste.

He sits down on the couch and flips on the telly. His mind refuses to give him a moment’s rest.

""On the one hand, I want to respect the guy, but is it that his art is more extraordinary than mine or simply that he has neat tools and technology that allow him to achieve his art? Are those mutually exclusive thoughts? I could do that if I had the technology and all those neat little toys. Oh….what to do? I think I love him. I love that he's better than me, but I'm afraid that if I don't keep working, I'll never see another one of his pieces again. But if I exert myself on something I know will never be as good as anything he produces, I'll go in with low motivation from the outset. Damn it.""

For the next several months, everything was quiet. Dogs were kept indoors. Art exhibits closed worldwide. People generally just become far less loquacious. It was so palpable you could feel it in the air. This worked to the Artist's advantage. Rather than rush into it, he spent months planning his next piece. Additional motivation came from the TV segment in which January and Grande compared him to Lowry. That's why the next piece he unveils to the world is an exact replica of Lowry's ""The Cripples"" using real dead bodies of crippled people and several dead dogs. This work attracted the Artist in particular because he could connect it back to his rival's previous windmill piece with the dogs. The Artist set the diseased cripples in the same position they are in Lowry's painting and placed them outside an abandoned factory in Manchester. Unloading them from the truck didn't take all that long. He had the help of three homeless men to whom he promised thirty quid each. After they helped set up the bodies, he killed them and used them to complete the picture.

Pleased with his work, the Artist hopes his counterpart responds in kind and uses the opportunity to recreate a famous work in his own fashion*—your move*.

What the Artist never could have predicted is that his counterpart would be ready with his counterattack in a matter of hours. The piece was discovered by Canadian hikers out in the Cairngorms a few minutes before sunset. It was a moment when what they beheld was so extraordinary they took it for a lie.

As the Artist predicted and hoped for, the piece was indeed a recreation, this time a replica of the work by Polish artist Zdzslaw Beksinski. As the Polish artist was apt to do, many of his famous works were titled ""Untitled"". This specific ""Untitled"" features a haunting, scared/scary humanoid face of greenish/gray pigmentation, skeletal and awful to behold, eyes black holes, with skeletal humanoid insectoid arachnoid hybrid bodies either pouring out of its gaping mouth or climbing into it. It's horrific imagery when viewed in an art gallery or online. In the background are bombed-out buildings, recalling the imagery of Dresden after the firebombing—a truly disgusting specimen. Yet here, in the Scottish Highlands, stood its remake. A remake that stands at 300 metres high, taller than both the world's tallest tree and the Great Pyramid. Its base was twice as wide as that of the Great Pyramid. What those Canadian hikers could not possibly have known when looking at the human bodies used to create this piece was that the Artist (#2) took ten percent of The United Kingdom's population, ten percent of Russia's, ten percent of Japan's, and ten percent of Nigeria's population. 55467000 deceased souls used to make this piece of art. How these countries and those numbers were chosen, nobody will ever know. The piece stood for a long time before anyone dared touch it and attempted to take it apart. For many, it became a religious pilgrimage to visit it and behold the most outstanding work of art ever undertaken on planet Earth.

On a quiet Sunday morning, only two men stand there, strangers to each other and respecting each other's desire for silence. One of them is the Artist, who long abandoned his pursuit of art and threw out all his equipment. That part of his life was definitively over. The other man is former Sergeant MacIntyre, who quit his job and took to heavy drinking. Nothing made sense to either of them anymore. It was like being born again in a new world where the laws of physics were different, and they had to relearn each and every aspect of life they had previously learned. They stand for hours, nearly shoulder to shoulder with one another, but never opening their mouths. They both think the same thought: *Who the hell was I chasing?*

So I woke up one morning to a text message from a random number it read

Hi is this ""myname"" ? and do you know ""lyingcheatersname""

I'm his girlfriend, and he's married and I'm just finding out about you now too ...

WTF was my first thought, I re-read the text ... and I started to talk with this woman. What unraveled was a story I am still wrapping my head around

To keep it short, the mistress had told the wife she existed and tried to send her receipts and the wife blocked her, accusing her of trying to ruin them.

""lyingcheater"" told his mistress he would leave his wife

He did not leave his wife, he told the wife he was going to rehab but was living with the mistress for a month all awhile

The mistress believed he had told the wife they were done, that was a lie,

So how do I fit into this ... well

We once had that crazy in love feeling 9 years ago but he was my ex now. He lived far away and I had started a career he had got ""cancer"" things also a lie ... but his excuse mainly he couldn't make the distance work

We had reconnected on and off over the years and he spoke about missing me and wanting to see me. We had dirty conversations and friendly conversations.

He stalked my IG and watched my stories daily for the last year. We would have conversations that felt so real and vulnerable and my feelings were returning. We started talking about getting together.

We set a coffee meetup and the day of he bailed (I find out later he was with mistress 1) he told me he was out of town (a lie) 


I left it for a month but I also wanted answers for why his behaviour and why he ghosted instead of communicating. He told me he was going through a tough patch and I had sympathy for him and was thinking it was because he was a dismissive avoidant.

My LAST message to him was hoping he finds a way to let someone in and doesn't sabatoge a meaningful connection.

He told me to re-add him on socials, but I didn't, I started praying to God for clarity instead

12 days later I woke up to that text ...

The text that's saying hi so you know ... this is .... I'm his girlfriend and he has a wife!!!

I found out he has been married for 27 years!!! He's lied about having a wife to me for 9 years!!!

Now I know the ghosting was because he had a wife the whole time and apparently has had other mistress's and the wife apparently knows but didn't leave him after these incidents occurred.

This current mistress had just been giving a promise ring and was shocked to find out about me. So we planned out our sting operation....

I never contacted him, and I gave the mistress receipts of our conversation as now she wanted to end things with him too

He went to her house, telling her I meant nothing and I was crazy, and I was just a friend. The mistress watched as he lied to her face, and he even wished death upon me! Can you imagine! He took ZERO responsibility and the mistress let him dig his hole. She dumped him that night 

I still haven't spoken to him and I won't. The moment I got the truth it was like a chord was severed. I feel free, free of all that emotional weight. He lied for YEARS!!!

All the missing pieces have been filled in, and it makes sense now. Cancer was a lie, away for work was lie, this man wasted my time.

I am so angry with him not telling me the truth, if I knew he was married I never would have engaged in a relationship with him.

So the question now is, do I reach out to his wife? Do I tell her I was his girlfriend years ago? He physically cheated on her. Do I tell her we have talked on and off for years and he's been emotionally cheating on her?

Does she even want to know, if she has already forgave this behaviour before more than once?

I severely underestimated how much extra laundry would be incurred by this newborn. I think I might've just had some sort of amnesia about how much clothing a young one goes through, especially one with reflux. I'm talking we do a load a day if not twice a day. I'm having an extremely hard time keeping up with the folding and putting it away and also going up and down the stairs with an infant with baskets after a c section. 

My husband works 4 10 hour shifts a week so when he gets home from work, the only time that we have is to have dinner and put the kids to bed. He is extremely hands-on on his days off but when he goes to work he basically does no chores I have dinner ready, dishwasher loaded and I do everything house and kid related. 

When the baby came I asked him if he would start taking loads of laundry downstairs and starting it before he leaves at 6 AM and then I can continue to flip it over because my biggest issue is bringing down big bins down our stairs with a baby and toddler in toe. Since I have asked him to do this, he has done it only once on his own. He will only do it if I remind him every single time and that includes if the laundry is right in front of the door that he leaves through for work and also piles and stacks of  clean laundry all over our kitchen table that he basically sits there and has his coffee and reads the newspaper for half an hour to an hour and just ignores. 

Today, I woke up to laundry all over our floor and all over our kitchen after a brutal night with the baby and my 3 year old screaming at me at 6 am bc I wouldn't let her have youtube. I just literally wanna throw out all the clothes. 

This is just one small area that annoys me out of many household mundane tasks that I have to do is a stay at home Mom. and I accept that the lion share is on me, but I'm wondering if I'm asking him too much to ask to do chores right before he goes to work if he gets up around 4:30 in the morning and then he has his coffee and gets ready and leaves around six?? It is quite early and he works hard too. 

I plan to ask him to help me with the laundry going up and down the stairs and take the garbage out with him when he leaves on the mornings he works then we split chores on weekends. 

Don't get me wrong - i LOVE being a stay at home mom I do not take for granted for one second how lucky I am to be able to take care of my children and not work however, I do feel extreme resentment about all the other things that come along with the invisible and mental load, and although I do think it's a labour of love, I also feel extremely angry some mornings. 

My biggest issue is that I have to coordinate, orchestrate, deligate, ask him to ""help"" me as if its only my work to do, remind him, constantly nag bc he forgets or doesnt notice - then he turns around and says its only me who thinks it ""needs"" to be done - if it were up to him he would just leave it until he's wearing inside out underwear.

The boys are back 😎 I'd been thinking of doing something with these two disasters again and then I got the Dom/Sub prompt for the @goodomensafterdark Fall Ball Kink Thrall event!

**CW/tags:** Dom/sub, Soft Dom/Top Crowley, Sub/Bottom Aziraphale, explicit sex, past trauma due to being neurodivergent in a neurotypical world, smut, human AU, ADHD Crowley and Autistic Aziraphale, dirty talk, blow jobs

**Summary:**

Azira and Crowley have been together for a few months and things are going great. However, when Azira catches sight of a particularly smutty piece of Accurate Prophecies fanart, it leads to him realising there's something he'd quite like to explore with Crowley, especially as it might alleviate some workplace stress...

Or: Crowley engages in some soft dom roleplay so he can give his angel exactly what he needs to stop thinking.

**Excerpt:**

While Crowley certainly found the illustration compelling, the effect it had upon Azira was far more interesting. His pupils were blown wide in arousal, barrel chest rising in stuttering breaths, lips hanging open as his tongue edged out to wet them. A flush began to grow across his cheeks, creeping slowly down that beautiful throat until it disappeared beneath a buttoned up shirt and bow tie.

The reaction was fascinating and Crowley took a moment to appreciate the sight of Azira Fell blue-screening. He and Crowley had been physically intimate for a while now and, while they'd both enjoyed being top and bottom at various points, they'd not discussed anything around submission and domination. The two things didn't automatically go hand in hand, after all. Azira hadn't mentioned being interested in such things, let alone a preference, but Crowley was starting to suspect his angel might have one.

""Alright there?"" he asked, and watched as Azira slowly came back to himself, blinking rapidly and clearing his throat as he did.

""Oh yes,"" he squeaked unconvincingly, ""ah, tickety-boo! I hope it's, well, given you some fodder for your next chapter!""

Eyebrows raised, Crowley let that exclamation pass (""tickety-boo""? Fuck, he really did love him) and covered his disbelief with a long sip of coffee. As Azira fussed with some imaginary fluff on his trouser leg, Crowley decided to wait and see. They hadn't been together long, but one thing Crowley understood was that Azira took maybe a little more time to process how he felt about things.

Placing his phone on the table, he wrapped an arm around Azira and cuddled up against him, drawing a pleased hum from the adorable man. No, Crowley thought, better he worked things through. He'd talk to Crowley when he was good and ready.

It turned out ""good and ready"" only took a day.

In addition to that, steam started also coming out of the filter, just a few seconds after pressing the power button and the button lights get steady, like a type of leak of some sort, this same behavior happens also when I start heating milk with the steam dispenser, steam starts coming out of the diffuser.

Keep in mind that I keep the machine clean with regular descaling when the orange indicator starts showing.

***What I have done but didn't work :***

* descaling
* water tank has no leak
* water inlet valve seems to be okay ( from where the water is drawn under the water tank ) ""not sure if they are called like that""
* remove / clean diffuser
* Made sure there's no steam / leak inside the appliance
* purge the appliance from water and steam ( just removed water, and I emptied it through the dispenser until there was nothing left )

The video shows the steam and the excess water dripping, but also what to focus on, is the part that shows that there is air / pressure that keeps on pushing water inside the tube / pipe, even after a while of the shot being delivered. ( *Sorry for the poor quality* )

After checking a couple of videos and the official appliance flow, it seems to me the problem might come from the pressure valve or the pump, or both, it might even be a bad O-ring that's holding the pipe,  but not sure what to replace exactly.

Also there's no official delonghi support / maintenance in my country, only retailers and I don't trust those.

Any ideas / advice would be highly appreciated.

I removed 2 wisdom teeth last wednesday. It's been a full week since then and my recovery seems non-existant.

Most of my mouth is covered by inflamation, my tongue hurts like I drinked hot coffee and I'm still only eating ice cream and liquidy stuff because chewing hurts like hell. Even just talking hurts, I resorted to communicating with my family through WhatsApp instead.

I had never had an extraction done before, so I didn't know the dentist. He was recommended to me by a family member.

He let the thingy that sucks saliva and blood fall on the ground lots of times, and put it straight back in my mouth.

When I tried to hold it in place while he tortured my ass, he scolded me saying my arms should be out of his way.

The whole process felt like my mouth was being ripped apart by an ogre or something. I never even imagined extracting wisdom teeth would be so horrible.

He told me to apply ice outside my mouth for the first 48h and yesterday, after I told him I was still in pain and with lots of inflamation after a whole week, he told me to stop taking the anti-inflamattory meds and painkillers he gave me after the procedure. Apparently from now on I'm supposed to go on only with anti-biotics.

I have a consult with him later today, but now feel like he isn't a trustworthy doctor.

The country I live in provides free universal healthcare, but the public hospital doctors said I needed a specialist and I waited a full year for one, but since the pain got unbearable, I chose to have the procedure done by this private doctor.

I don't know if what's happening in my mouth is a normal consequence of my negligence to it's health or if I should seek another doctor to help me recover.",2,1732713773.0,askdentists,14,1.0,False

For years, I let the holidays consume me. I’d stay up too late, snacking on cookies I didn’t even want, running on coffee instead of rest, telling myself I’d “get healthy” in January. Sound familiar? I told myself it was just part of being a busy mom, that my health could wait. But here’s the truth: waiting didn’t help.

One year, I hit my breaking point. I looked at my daughters—four amazing little humans watching my every move—and realized I wasn’t just surviving the holidays. I was barely surviving myself. How could I teach them to care for their bodies, to prioritize themselves, if I wasn’t doing it for me?

That’s when everything changed.

What I Realized
The holidays are stressful—period. But they don’t have to be an excuse to lose yourself. I realized that taking care of me wasn’t selfish; it was essential. Because when I’m strong, when I feel good, I show up better for my family. I’m more patient. I’m more present. And I’m teaching my daughters that it’s okay to put yourself on the list, too.

What I Learned (and What You Can Do)
I want to share what’s helped me not only survive the holidays but actually thrive—and yes, even lose weight. If I can do this with four kids and endless chaos, so can you.

1. Nutrition Is Your Anchor

You don’t need to starve yourself or say goodbye to holiday treats. Just be mindful.

Eat real meals, even on busy days. Think protein, veggies, and healthy fats.
Have the cookie, but stop at one. Savor it. Enjoy it. Don’t eat it out of stress.
Stay hydrated—most of us confuse hunger with thirst, especially when life is hectic.
2. Find Ways to Move (Even in the Madness)

I used to think I needed an hour at the gym to see results. Spoiler: you don’t.

Walk while your kids are playing or during a phone call.
Dance in your kitchen while cooking dinner (bonus: your kids will love it).
Do 10-minute workouts—YouTube is a treasure trove of quick, effective routines.
3. Sleep Is Your Secret Weapon

I know it’s tempting to stay up late wrapping gifts or binge-watching Netflix, but sleep matters more.

When you’re well-rested, you’re less likely to overeat or crave junk.
Set a bedtime and stick to it. Treat it like a non-negotiable appointment.
4. Shift Your Mindset

This was the hardest part for me. I used to feel like the holidays were an impossible obstacle. Now, I see them as a chance to prove to myself that I’m stronger than the chaos.

Focus on what really matters: your health, your happiness, your family.
Tell yourself: I can enjoy the holidays without letting them derail me. Because you can.
You’re Not Alone in This
The holidays can feel overwhelming, like you’re being pulled in every direction. But let me tell you this: you’re stronger than you think. You’re capable of finding balance. You’re worthy of taking care of yourself, no matter how busy life gets.

I’ve been there. I’ve felt the exhaustion, the overwhelm, the temptation to just give up and wait for January. But now, I’m here to tell you: you don’t have to wait. You can take small steps now. You can make choices that leave you feeling proud and energized.

And when you feel like you’re struggling, remember this: you’re not just surviving the holidays—you’re leading by example. For your kids, your family, and most importantly, for yourself.

One is directly enhanced by roast levels, while the other is indirectly inhibited by them. So, it’s possible to find something with medium acidity and medium bitterness or something lightly acidic and lightly bitter—but never something very acidic and very bitter. This is because, while roast levels don’t dictate acidity, they can certainly suppress it.

The absolute retards at Toffee Coffee Roasters proved the scientifically naive part of me wrong. When I make such statements, it’s mostly because I expect even roasts like those from Blue Tokai. Toffee Coffee Roasters, on the other hand, are notorious for having uneven roasts—God knows why.

P.S.: I know I shouldn’t order from them, and I generally don’t. I usually stick to Blue Tokai’s Silver Oak as my daily driver. But as a bootstrapped founder, I have bad months, and they are the more affordable option. If anyone knows good light or medium roasts priced around ₹350/250g, I’d love suggestions (P.P.S.: I’m aware of Hunkal Heights).",7,1732713224.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

1h13s44,https://i.redd.it/foawp3mzzf3e1.png,The Transformative Alchemy of Gratitude: Unveiling Life's Hidden Treasures • [Click to Expand],"## From Acknowledgment to Empowerment: The Profound Journey of Thankfulness

Imagine for a moment that gratitude is like a magical lens through which we view the world—a lens that has the power to transform ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences. It's not just a fleeting emotion or a polite social gesture, but a profound philosophical and psychological practice that can fundamentally reshape our perception of life itself.

At its core, gratitude is a deep recognition of the value and meaning embedded in our experiences, relationships, and the intricate web of circumstances that shape our existence. It's about seeing beyond the surface, acknowledging the invisible threads of connection that weave through our daily lives. When we truly practice gratitude, we're not just saying ""thank you"" – we're engaging in a radical act of mindfulness and appreciation.

Consider for a moment the smallest moments that often go unnoticed. The warmth of morning sunlight streaming through your window, the comfort of a soft bed after a long day, the unexpected kindness of a stranger, or the simple ability to breathe and experience life. These are not trivial things, but profound gifts that we frequently overlook in our fast-paced, achievement-driven world.

The science behind gratitude is equally fascinating. Psychological research has consistently shown that practicing gratitude is not just a feel-good exercise, but a powerful tool for mental and emotional well-being. When we engage in gratitude affirmations, we're essentially rewiring our brain's neural pathways. We're training ourselves to focus on abundance rather than lack, on possibility rather than limitation.

Personal stories often illuminate this concept most powerfully. I remember a time in my own life when everything seemed to be going wrong – a challenging job loss, a difficult relationship breakdown, financial stress. It would have been easy to spiral into negativity. But a small practice of writing down three things I was grateful for each day began to shift my perspective. Some days, these were monumentally simple things: a hot cup of coffee, a kind text from a friend, the ability to take a deep breath.

What's remarkable about gratitude is its ripple effect. It's not just an internal experience but a relational practice that transforms how we interact with the world. When we approach life with genuine thankfulness, we become more compassionate, more understanding, more connected. We recognize that our existence is not a solitary journey, but an intricate dance of giving and receiving.

The affirmation of gratitude goes beyond mere positive thinking. It's a sophisticated emotional intelligence that acknowledges both the light and shadow of human experience. It doesn't deny challenges or difficulties but instead chooses to see them as opportunities for growth, learning, and deeper understanding.

Consider the neurochemical magic that occurs when we practice gratitude. Our brain releases dopamine and serotonin – neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and happiness. This isn't just a temporary mood boost, but a potential long-term recalibration of our emotional landscape. Regular gratitude practice has been linked to reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, improved sleep quality, and even enhanced immune system functioning.

But gratitude is not about forced positivity or toxic optimism. It's about cultivating a genuine sense of wonder and appreciation. It's about recognizing that life, with all its complexity and unpredictability, is a remarkable gift. This doesn't mean we ignore pain or pretend that difficult experiences don't exist. Instead, we learn to hold both the challenging and the beautiful with equal reverence.

Social connections are particularly nurtured through gratitude. When we express genuine appreciation to others, we create bridges of understanding and empathy. A heartfelt ""thank you"" is never just a social nicety – it's an acknowledgment of another's humanity, an recognition of their effort, their kindness, their contribution to our life's tapestry.

The practice of gratitude is also deeply philosophical. It challenges our culture's pervasive narrative of scarcity and competition. In a world that constantly tells us we are not enough, that we need more to be happy, gratitude whispers a revolutionary message: you are already whole, you are already rich in ways that transcend material measurement.

As we cultivate this practice, we begin to see life not as a series of transactions, but as a continuous flow of interconnected experiences. We become more present, more attuned to the subtle beauties that surround us. Gratitude becomes not just an emotion, but a way of being – a lens of appreciation that colors our entire existence.

So I invite you to experiment. Start small. Find three things each day that you're genuinely thankful for. They don't need to be grand or extraordinary. Let them be simple, authentic, true to your lived experience. Watch how this practice begins to reshape your inner landscape, how it opens you to a more expansive, more compassionate way of experiencing the world.

Gratitude is not a destination, but a continuous journey of awakening – a profound practice of seeing, acknowledging, and celebrating the magnificent ordinary moments that compose the extraordinary story of our lives.

Robert sat atop a majestic horse and was riding all around the rural landscape. He wore a small black vest, held open by a single button, underneath this was a brace of pistols bulging from his breast. Upon his teat was a solid gold sonichu medallion. Suddenly, from the corner of Roberts eye, Indians began to appear on either side of him, riding as fast on evil-looking mouth-frothing war horses of their own. Each held high a bow and arrow and one by one as the riders passed Robert they let loose with their deadly charge, skewering Roberts figure as he cried out in pain at each strike.

It was at this point that Christian woke atop a steaming mound of his own excrement.

""Well hi there,"" said the steaming mound of excrement, ""pleased to meet you, I'm your future offspring!""

Christian made blubberguts noises from the thing he called a mouth and fell, naked and filthy, onto the floor, ""n-no!"" he cried in his garbled manner, ""y-you are not Crystal!""

But the mound of steaming, now absolutely stinking, excrement merely chortled,

""tee hee, silly,"" it said, ""I'm not your ‘literal’ offspring, but your ‘literary’ offspring: the sum total of your creative literary output!""

And it was at this moment of pupil dilation that Christian actually woke up with a sneering mess in his giant tent of a pair of underpants.

He cupped his hands to his face, spreading excrement over himself inadvertently, and began to sing,

*""oh heavens, oh heavens, what am I to do?*

*why it's the middle of the afternoon and I'm covered in a poo!*

*oh my mommy will be mighty steamed when I go tell her this,*

*but a mothers job, as every boy knows, is to scrub up all the shit!""*

Unluckily for Christian he had quite forgotten that he was still incarcerated.

He stopped singing and gazed into space as the cold glow of the white lightbulb illuminated the cold tiles of the four walls around him.

One day it had begun to rain.

I sat atop an elephant en route to Delhi, swinging this way and that, and thought the rain rather pleasant. I noticed, however, that when the rain stopped it had impregnated the jungle with tens of thousands of tiny screaming white men, all wearing no armor and carrying sticks with little dinner knives upon the end.

They spoke of Empire and of Trade.

I smiled to myself, ""trade,"" I mused, for my Dutch was perfect and I understood them entirely - for reasoning that is far beyond the scope of this anecdote, ""what have you to give me that I could possibly want?""

One of them, evidently the leader, judging that he held a musical instrument in his paws, stepped forward and said, ""we offer you your own life,"" and he snarled.

I feigned to cower and then laughed bitterly, ""poltroon,"" I denounced, ""for I am a mighty fellow, my trousers are large and my elephant has a death count of untold numbers from untold numbers of military conquests,"" and I smirked at his defiant expression, ""and I am a mere retainer of my lord, and he to his, all of them in our hierarchy infinitely more accomplished as the ladder ascends to the heavens themselves, whereupon sits the Emperor of Man,"" I laughed aloud, ""'you offer me 'my' life? I shall take yours now, for such an insult,"" and I reached out him with my rubber extendable arms and picked him up like a dust brush and used his legs to tickle the hats of his comrades before throwing him far away into the depths of the jungle.

At this point the other chaps began to cry out in terror and panic but they were rallied by the lowest amongst them, a fellow of such low rank that he wore his hat at a queer angle by comparison to the rest of them, he called for them to ""steel their nerve,"" and to ""unleash munitions upon the darkie,"" and one by one their little sticks began to burst out with 'pop pop', but every attack failed. It was gunpowder, no doubt, but none possessed the powder mixture enough to propel their dinner knives towards me.

I laughed as the sound of popping surrounded me, half expecting a caravaneer to step out from the bushes with a negro slave, as they much enjoyed to dance at the sound of the popping of the mouth.

""Foolish barbarians,"" I sighed, ""let us end this.""

I extended my wings and rose up high with my elephant hanging to my belt with its powerful little legs, I hung high above the scattering remnants of this pseudo-imperial spore burst and began to play my sitar, which turned them all to static glass upon the first prick of the first string, with the second prick they shattered into glass befitting for a ladies finger.

""And so the circle of life goes on,"" I mused, and carried along the road to Delhi.

Christian had got his fingers caught in his ears again. He was rolling around on the floor shrieking like a lunatic, still naked.

""To think,"" said one of the orderlies, ""that kids nowadays watch this kind of thing on the internet, we should be honoured,"" he laughed, ""to have such a ringside seat to such genius,"" and he grinned and turned away.

""I say, are we going to put the hose pipe up his bottom again?"" asked the junior orderly, ""because that was lots of fun!""

""You sub-saharans are sick in the mind,"" muttered the first orderly, ""what's wrong with you?"" he asked, ""you spent time in Saudi Arabia didn't you? Didn't you pick up any manners, monkey?""

""Well,"" said the second, ""in Kenya the British say that we're just fine,""

""Oh, Kenya, Kenya,"" by this point the two of them were back in the breakroom, ""you have mentioned, once or twice, that you were from Kenya,""

""Well in Kenya...""

Salman stopped listening. He had returned to his folding chair and had his coffee in hand and just closed his eyes, letting the mindless babble of George Watson from Kenya sing him to sleep.

Moments had passed before a startled shout brought Salman back to his senses.

He saw that George was cowering in the corner of the breakroom, his hands covering his head, sobbing loudly and saying in a quiet voice, ""no no no no no,""

""What is it, George?"" said Salman, ""what are your negro senses telling you?""

George pointed to the ceiling and Salman's beady eyes followed the trajectory of the thick brown finger and unreasonably pink fingernail. When he saw it, his jaw dropped.

Hanging from the ceiling was a monster unlike anything he had ever seen, ""god is great,"" he exclaimed and as he did so the monster fell upon him, tearing him to pieces with it razor tipped claws as George whined and wailed with his usual meekness.

""George,"" cried Salman, ""help me!""

""I cannot!"" replied George, ""I cannot!""

""Imagine it is a defenceless inpatient,"" insisted Salman wresting a talon from the monster at the very moment it would have torn his eyeball from his head, ""as Mohammed said, it is in the mind! MAKE THE MOUNTAIN A MOLEHILL!""

George screamed and cried and wailed.

""GOD IS GREAT!"" shouted Salman as a massive talon coasted towards his neck.

""I say, patient,"" said George, ""you have forgotten to put away your snakes and ladders gaming table box,"" and he said it in a slow disconnected sort of way, as if possessed by a Jinn, and then began to strike the monster upon its spine with the large nailed baton that George carried about him at all times.

The monster screeched and hissed, its talons whirling like a dervish, and eventually it was quickly dead.

The two orderlies were reduced to stunned silence as the corporeal form of the monster turned into dust and vanished into the pages of Salmans travel koran.

""by god,"" Salman breathed, ""we did it,""

George dropped the club to the floor, ""I am become death,"" he quoted from British Television, and he took again to sobbing in the corner.

On the 24th of July 2023 it was announced on the teletext that Christian Weston Chandler had been found dead in a trash compactor, having been lured inside of the equipment by his Pokemon Go device under reasoning which is of little consequence. Many quietly rejoiced that this horrific story, along with its implications for the social sciences, was at last brought to an end before things could get even worse; indeed, many believed that with Christian Weston Chandler dead that everything would all go back to the way it was. As if with him dead some sort of vaguely defined mechanism in the universe would self-correct. I thought such people were fools.

With the last shreds of my academic authority I managed to elbow my way into a guest spot on a television program to share the reality of what was, in my opinion, the most preeminent danger faced by humanity.

""But he's dead,"" laughed the interviewer, turning to the audience, ""it's all over, we can rest easy in our beds at last,"" and they laughed.

I composed myself, as best as I could through my total disdain for having to even be in the studio, ""we are not primitive peoples,"" I said very slowly and deliberately, ""the notion that a social cascade event terminates with the death of its progenitor is a laughable nonsense; a regressive mode of thinking at its core fundament,"" I took a slip of my glass of water, ""Chris Chan,"" I said, ""was an advanced copy, on the genetic and sociobiological scale,"" several tittered in the audience, and I forced myself to smile at this, ""I do not mean that he was ‘cognitively advanced’,” I went on, “far from it, but rather that when any species enter a new environment or set of circumstances that they adapt in kind to respond to that environment; that is: the digital one, and thus the qualities to be manifested with the next generation manifest first of all in the advanced copy.""

""But Chris Chan did not have sex,"" sighed the interviewer, and he turned to the audience flashing overly white teeth, ""who's the professor here?"" he exclaimed and they laughed.

""Well, that much is evident,"" I feigned a chuckle, ""but in my thesis,"" I went on, ""the advanced copy does not need to procreate; it is a test dummy, so to speak, built to implode on impact, merely a forerunner of trends and traits already manifest in the population at large.""

The interviewer forgot his line, he was staring at me with a cold expression.

I gave a little shrug of humility, ""who can deny that in these last ten years that the traits we recognized as bewildering, absurd, inept, laughable and all things bad and immature,"" I drew breath, ""that all of these traits have become more and more normalized.""

""That was his influence!"" shouted someone in the audience.

""Nonsense,"" I said, leaning back in my chair, ""that is wishful thinking; unjustifiable optimism with a bent toward denialism of science,"" and I stabbed the air in the speakers direction, ""you would like to pretend it is all over,"" I snarled, ""but it has only just begun. Look around you,"" I spat, ""look at your children and the political climate, they are all Chris Chan now. Locked in their bedrooms, engaging in constant psychopathy over a digital medium, engage in infantile persecution narratives, romances across a keyboard with digital avatars in fur costume,"" I found my pulse had quickened and my head felt over light, I stopped again to draw breath and glared into the faces of the audience.

I dabbed at my brow with a handkerchief. The lights were too hot.

The interviewer broke the silence, ""then, doc,"" he said, avoiding eye contact, ""what are we supposed to do?""

Dr Forskins emerged from the operating room covered in blood, pieces of pink flesh were gobbed all over him, and it made me feel a little uneasy about the outcome of my Wifes examination. He threw himself against the wall and began to sob and pound his fists upon the tiles, ""why, why,"" he was wailing.

""I say, Doctor,"" I said, ""is everything alright?""

He stepped away from the wall, ""ah, Senor Garcia,"" he addressed me by name and title, ""everything is far from fine,"" and he wiped a bloodied hand across his face to knock a tear from his eye, ""I am afraid I have some absolutely atrocious news,"" he said, walking toward me, ""you had best take off your hat.""

I steeled myself for the worst and resumed my place upon a tiny plastic chair, my aptly named sombrero now held fast between my thick hands.

Dr Forskins sat beside me, and placed his hand on my inner thigh, ""I am afraid, young man,"" he said softly, looking to the floor, ""that we discovered your Wife has been profusely bleeding from the vagina for several days; a ovarian haemorrhage, worse,"" and he gave a long sigh, shaking his head, ""she had been concealing this by putting pieces of absorbent fabric actually 'inside' her vagina to collect the blood,"" at this my jaw dropped, I began to ask 'why' but the Doctor anticipated my question, ""I do not know what possesses some people to do such things,"" at last he removed his hand from my thigh, and went for his pocket, ""here,"" he said, holding up a small plastic bag, ""have you ever come across this kind of thing before?""

I squinted at the plastic bag and, making no sense of it, put on my spectacles and tried again. The plastic bag contained a handful of coloured pills that, judging by the residue inside of the bag, were certainly of a very chalky nature.

""No,"" I answered.

""Well, this is called Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and this is what your Wife will be taking three times a day for the next six months,"" he offered me the bag, ""as you can see, there are small pictures on each tablet which are indicators toward her temperament,"" and I examined the bag, chuckling at the pictures on the tablets, ""gosh,"" I said, ""how jolly!"" and the Doctor continued, ""now,"" he said, ""these are not usually available on prescription through the NHS so I'm afraid you'll be out of pocket on this, but not to worry because the first months prescription I can give you at no cost whatsoever. If you and Senora Garcia feel that the prescription is not working then there is no need to continue and we can perhaps reevaluate her case, though I may add that pharmaceuticals in this category can become rather ridiculously expensive whilst the Methylenedioxymethamphetamine; a relatively all-purpose and safe pharmaceutical, is very inexpensive at no more than forty new pence a tablet.""

""Forty new pence a tablet?"" I gasped, ""multiplied by three and then by thirty?"" I was aghast at the figures, ""but that's exactly thirty six pounds,"" I said in a rather dejected tone.

""As I say,"" the Doctor went on, ""it is inexpensive,"" and he raised a finger, ""only by 'contrast' to the other pharmaceuticals in this category. For instance,"" he explained, ""if we find that Methylenedioxymethamphetamine does nothing for your Wifes condition then the next option would be a dosage of Methoxycarbonyltropan administered twice every hour, of which a single dosage would cost somewhere between seventy to one hundred and forty pounds, depending on the procurement cost to the pharmacist.""

At this my eyes practically bulged from my head, ""why that's more money than exists in all the world,"" I exclaimed in incredulity, and the Doctor gave a little shrug, ""it is the nature of the economy these days,"" he said, evidently reconciled to the situation, ""as England thinks it wise to procure at exorbitant cost from the Americas what it could otherwise produce on home soil for virtually no cost whatsoever,"" and we both said nothing.

""Well,"" I said, and bit my lip, weighing hard the consequence of my choice on this matter, ""we will try the Methylene ..."" I could not even pronounce it, ""the Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,"" said the Doctor helpfully, ""yes,"" I said, nodding hurriedly, ""and I will look into taking a second job, should we need to continue for the full course,"" ""it is advisable,"" said the Doctor, ""I have seen great success with Methylenedioxymethamphetamine in every instance of its application,"" and he got to his feet, ""I will return with a blue shopping bag full of loose pills momentarily.""

Jim was dancing with joy for his first day at school, he wore a massive pink ribbon around his throat was dressed in a gay suit of shimmering blue felt with his socks pulled up to his knees. Luckily it was the early 1800's and he could get away with it.

""I want to be a soldier!"" he exclaimed to his Mother, and he made like he was holding a rifle and said, ""phew, I've got you Indian!"" and he threw his head back and laughed.

His Mother, being of a common disposition, gawked aghast and clapped her hands to her cheeks and exclaimed, ""by all the Saints in New England,"" and she grabbed him by the arm and threw him across her knee and began patting his buttocks as Jim made like he was running a marathon with his legs, ""not my fanny!"" he cried and began to bawl.

Fat Susanne, the Black Maid, turned away in disgust, ""I can't stand violence,"" she said, through her thick French accent, ""especially against the churns,"" and this made Tall William, another Black in the Household, clutch at his lips and run to inspect the butter churns, for his grasp of language was poor though his sense of stewardship carried over to his good senses; the churns were his job to polish from the inside and the out with his great thick cloth.

""Oh Missus Newports,"" wailed Fat Susanne, stumbling into the drawing room like a blinded pig, ""I beg you, I beg you, spare the rod!"" and she fell to the floor and began to suckle at Jims Mothers toecaps. She made a gargling sound with her throat, extended her overbite atop her great lower lip and her tear-filled eyes gazed up at Jims Mother, for indeed as Fat Susanne had suckled Jim herself and felt a sense of compassion as like some creatures of the wilderness might feel toward their offspring.

This was enough to cause Jims Mother to relent, ""Oh Susanne,"" she sighed, ""it's for the boys own good, you know, just like when Irish Percy flogs the slaves when they become Unchristian-Like, it is the same thing,"" and she tossed Jim to the carpet. The boy dragged his face across the floor on his knees, clutching at his buttocks and sobbing. ""You see,"" Jim's Mother went on, ""the boy had took to violence against the innocent Red Man, and envisaged himself clad in soldierly tunic and carrying the devils penis and ejaculating hot throbbing loads into all and sundry,"" and she licked her lips and wobbled slightly in her chair, thinking delicious thoughts as the words left her mouth, ""so this had to be discouraged,"" and she smiled and reached for the heroin.

Fat Susanne's mouth formed the Letter O and she stared at Jim who stared back through his tiny eyes and his face was like that of meeting the smell of a latrine, and Fat Susanne, who barely understood English, believed that Jim's Mother had said something altogether different than what she had, through her drug-addled drawl, intended and attempted to convey. All that existed then in Fat Susannes mind was Jim, with his pants at his ankles, masturbating in the presence of Indians and there was a perverse grin upon his face as he did so as if he was proud and ecstatic to do such a thing in her presence.

""By all the Saints in New England!"" echoed Fat Susanne, ""that's worthy a strip!"" and she began pawing toward Jim across the carpet like a mad rabid walrus and Jim shrieked and crawled under his mothers chair, for he knew what the Fat Woman had in mind. A length of thick leather, hardened with Gum Arabic that went hard across the bottom. ""Ma ma,"" he pleaded, ""ma, ma,"" begging for sympathy from his addict Mother, but she merely chuckled to herself, ""'tis the will of the Lord,"" she sang and lost consciousness, slumping in her chair.

At that very moment a pair of massive hands grabbed at Jim's ankles and dragged him from his haven and into the miserable glare of the Sol, and down came his pantaloons and off were torn his knickers and the mad Black lady was smashing his buttocks with her terrible dreadful macabre 'strip'.

She howled in broken English things that Jim had never heard said before and by the time she had said those things the pain had reached such a level that any form of language was like a soft dry bundle of cotton being flexed between the fingers, crackling and crackling.

In the next instant Jim was standing in the schoolyard on his first day, then a great hand shoved him along and in the next moment he was in his classroom, standing disheveled before 300 scalawags from the poor part of town, dressed in his mangled felt suit with a torn pink ribbon across his neck and clad only in his knickers.

""He's all yours,"" said Fat Susanne to the boys, many of whom came straight from the docks, and she pulled Jim around to face her, and stuck a great fat finger in his face, ""now don't you be masturbating in front of Indian Men anymore!"" and she said the words loudly and slowly and Jim felt her hot breath sear across his face. And in that moment he regained his senses and realized where he was and who was listening and what they were likely thinking.

# The Princess and the Pea

Princess Honeypot was furiously masturbating when her servant girl, Bella, strolled in carrying the piss pot, ""I am nearly done,"" shouted the Princess, her back hunched over her desktop computer and her legs awkwardly splayed, ""oh, Jesus,"" shouted Bella, ""this is the seventh time this week, Princess, I've told you that if you keep doing this I'm going to report you for lewd conduct,"" and Bella stomped to the middle of the room, slammed down the piss pot and left.

The Princess, her orgasm ruined by social contact, turned and shouted for Bella to come back, that she was sorry but that she just couldn't orgasm properly, ""I don't know what I'm doing,"" she mumbled and began to weep.

At that moment the bells of the nearby chapel began to sound and it was the signal that the castle was under attack by Vikings riding Elephants who came from the sea, ""oh no,"" whinnied the Princess, clasping her face, and she threw herself from her desktop computer workstation toward the window, where she stood nude and screamed in horror as the Elephants flew in spirals toward the castle.

Her trusty bodyguard, Sir Cuthbert Coombes, swaggered forth into her bedroom, ""Your Grace,"" he said, clanking as he saluted, ""we must hurry to the safest place in the castle, that being the dungeons, and shut you up in a dank cell in order that the Vikings do not clasp upon your person and ruin you for marriage.""

And so they did this. Unfortunately as Sir Cuthbert Coombes had completed his duties and hurried to join in the fighting he was engulfed in an Elephants breath and made intensely damp, this then turned his armour to rust and he was immediately shattered into thousand fragments by the head-butt of a particularly fat Viking.

Of course the Vikings lacked the desire to occupy the castle and embark upon the business of management of the surrounding provinces and so after they had stolen the cheese and the brandy they went away again, as expected. However Sir Cuthbert Coombes had neglected to inform anybody of exactly where he had hidden the Princess and it was almost impossible to tell who was who in the castle dungeons because plenty of Women had been stuffed down there during the rule of Regent Edgar Fannyfingers who had been deposed last Thursday by his nephew the King. Indeed, when the drafted soldiery burst down into the dungeons they found more than a dozen haggard crones who all claimed to be 'a' Princess.

""There is only one way to tell,"" said the King, a hulking great Man of pure muscle and a great blondbeard, ""we shall have a contest,"" and when the Princess insisted that she was obviously the Princess because of her lavish frock and jewellery by comparison to the crones dressed in dirty rags the King ordered her to shut up and trust in the judgment of God, of which the King alone was the intermediary and by which the manner of divination was funny contests.

So it came to be that Bella, who had known the Princess for several months, was called forth to perform the piss pot contest whereupon Bella would be blindfolded and made to hold and smell the defecation of the crones; to judge by weight and texture and taste also, and the Princess in order to decide who was more likely to be the Princess, because her eyes could not be trusted. Unfortunately for the Princess Bella was clueless at this contest and declared a random old hag to be the Princess, and then when realizing her error as the blindfold was removed she begged the King for another contest of which she would also be blindfolded.

She explained that each evening she would often find the Princess masturbating and she, surely, by the howls of ardour would be able to tell by hear exactly who was the Princess.

The crones eagerly threw up their dresses and began to masturbate where they stood, many of them slavering and looking all around them at the young Men and the Kings hulking muscles for inspiration, whilst Bella wandered back and forth blindfolded and with her arms extended listening for the sounds of orgasm.

At the end of the line of crones the Princess, furiously rubbing at her quim to not much effect suddenly felt entirely aroused by the eyes of the courtiers all upon her body, and she went cross eyed and her knees clutched together and her teeth hung over her lower lip and she found, as she cried like a puppy with its paw stuck in a mousetrap, that she was AT LAST enjoying coitus.

UNHAPPILY HOWEVER this resulted in Bella declaring, yet again, that a random crone was the Princess, and by the sheer laws of sod it was the very same random crone as had chosen beforehand. In the eyes of the court this was a decisive conclusion and the judgment of God had been revealed.

The King bounded down from his throne, threw his cape at his back and extolled to the crone, ""oh young sister of mine, thou art radiant!"" and the haggard crone slobbered and cackling rushed into his arms and began pawing at his bottom, babbling about all the dresses she wanted him to buy and all the cheese and brandy she was going to eat now that she was recognized in the annals of history as the legitimate Princess of the Kingdom.

The real Princess, however, had not escaped the Kings attention, and he grabbed a soldier by the scruff of his neck and muttered into the soldiers ear that he should take 'the pretty girl' and have her sent to his Royal Bedchamber with a good quantity of BDSM equipment and a large radish.

And so, in a way, all was well in the Kingdom. Except that the King and the Princess inbred many inbred bastards who in fact turned out to be a genius corps of cavalry commanders and administrators, and that a great war decimated the Kingdom as the King of the county next-door was infuriated to be given a toothless old biddy as his bride and not the pretty young Princess, which was taken as a great insult.

But we have learned a lesson here, which is self-explanatory.

Harold suddenly woke up to find a Man smashing his legs in with a length of metal piping, ""I say,"" shouted Harold, ""be off with you,"" and he reached for his dog, who he kept beside his bed. Harold leveled the dog at the Man and iterated his previous command, and this time the Man fled, leaving a trail of scum behind him on the floor.

Harold fell upon the floor at once; he was eyeing the trail of scum with his magnifying glass, ""fascinating, fascinating,"" he was muttering, ""where did he come from?"" he mused, and, ""how did he enter my estates?""

Now, if this scenario resonates with you as a near daily occurrence, reader, you may be interested in purchasing Offman's tapered steel spikes which are guaranteed to impede the delivery of a ruffians footpads to act of hoodlumery by the scientific process of impalation of the foot and the ball of heel. Of his own accord the ruffian will sound the alarm and your servants will be swift to apprehend him, and they will be safe-assured in their Offman's reinforced steel boots which are designed to avert the iatrogenesis of Offman's tapered steel spikes from impeding their own progress toward the goal of apprehension.

Few Gentlemen are aware that the purchase of a bounty-box of Offman's tapered steel spikes accompanies with it the inclusion of a pair of Offman's reinforced steel boots.

Let us revisit the earlier scenario and add to the equation the inclusion of these two amenities.

Harold suddenly woke to find his servant, Chidesworth, having knocked upon his bedroom door, ""sorry'm to bother you's, master, but we is captured another pesk' dang Irishlander,"" and at this Harold began to laugh and laugh, rolling like a babe in his great bed in the knowledgeable comfort of assured security.

But then he noticed that Chidesworth walked with a limp and he became aware then of his only mistake: to not have purchased several addition pairs of Offman's reinforced steel boots.

Jordan Peterson fumbled with the bottle of benzodiazepines in his suit coat pocket; the tears welling in his eyes and raw emotion flooding his brain, he shook out six little pills into the palm of his hand and sighed, ""oh bloody hell,"" he squeaked, at last succumbing to the sobs and he threw the pills into his mouth.

All of a sudden the world was alright. He pressed his face up to the window of the taxi cab and experienced visions of God as the driver laughed and sucked hard on a tobacco pipe, toying with his great beard, and beckoned him forth onto a magical journey. Jordan was in the car in the next moment, throwing money all around him, and the car took off into the night sky as a world of neon and red shone through the windows, bouncing off the turban of the sagacious driver whose head spun around and around, uttering profundities.

Together they climbed a cloud and fluttered like a feather on the breeze as they coasted over the colossus of Emperor Commodus Dressed As Hercules, and the radiance of his disinterested expression turned away, the oranges in his massive hand shimmering and sparkling, and Jordan felt as if the upper portion of his brain had been ripped away like a fitted carpet being torn away to make way for hardwood. Cold waves rushed through his body.

And then in short bursts of hard pale light the scenes began to bleed through into Jordans consciousness: the spinning head of the jolly cab driver was a picture of gnashing teeth, a filthy beard, thick hairy and rifling through his pockets demanding ""twenty dollar twenty dollar,"" and Jordan fell into the snow, his trousers around his ankles.

It was like the lights of a Christmas Tree, those flashing bulbs of the photographers cameras that crowded around to get the money shot of excrement covered buttocks and the telltale sight of a contraceptive poking from therein, as like a balloon half-swallowed by a clown at a childrens birthday party having choked upon the black forest gateau beforehand.

Like a newborn baby Jordans limbs thrashed in the snow, bound only by his trousers at his ankles, he kicked and swiped at the air, searching for his mothers teat and trying, as every Man had done before him, to grasp at those elusive rocketships and aeroplanes that circled around and around the twin domes of blown eyeballs.

Jordan uttered a series of short sharp shrieks as the din of bulbs induced a stroke and after the last thrashing movements as his neurons burned away his centers of speech a canyon formed in unison as God carved the landscape in the snow from an inundation of urine. In Jordans mind a great brown bear dressed in workmans overalls and a yellow hard hat had seized him by the shirt collars and was swiping at his face, delivering thick lacerations with its frightful claws.

Jordan awoke some weeks later by the rustling of a newspaper in front of his face, and he cried silently in horror as he saw images of himself beside a dirty pair of buttocks - his own. He craned his neck aside, to bury his face into the pillow of his hospital bed and saw, next, a great brown bear dressed in workmans overalls and a yellow hard hat moving towards him from a distant corridor. Its arms extended above its head and each step falling heavy and slow as it advanced. Jordan screamed in silence again, his trembling fingers moving toward the orderly who was still grinning and shoving the newspaper in his face.

Soon the doors of the hospital room smashed open in a shower of glass and the great brown bear gripped Jordan by one leg and dragged him from the bed, tearing away some tubes and causing others to drag on machinery and drips until popping out either at his end or theirs.

Jordan screamed and screamed in silence as the great brown bear dragged him away into the total dark.

Young Jordy sat waiting for the bus on what should have been the first glorious day of a new school year. He had been sue he had seen a really big fluffy bear peeking out at him from behind a hedge on one of the nearby houses. His little face lit up as the bear made itself known and put its paws upto its mouth, feigning bewilderment that it had been spotted by Jordy, before it made its way, quite gingerly, across the road - being sure to look both ways twice before making the intrepid crossing.

The fluffy bear sat beside Jordy, ""you know,"" it said, ""there's sure a lot of things in the world that make me nervous.""

Jordy was incredulous at this statement, ""but you're a bear,"" he squeaked, ""how can anything make you nervous? Why, golly, you can just go, brrururh!"" and Jordy threw his arms around, making as he was tearing a Man to piece with bear paws, ""and everybody would run all away!""

The fluffy bear put a paw to its mouth, deep in thought, ""you know,"" it said, ""I never really thought about it like that,"" and then it said, ""hm,"" and then asked, ""do you mean like this?""

Jordan screamed and screamed and screamed as the great brown bear took down an emergency escape door, dashing aside a cowering nurse with a brutal blow whose only crime had been to get in the way of the bear. She had fallen, her stomach torn open and bright pink organs slopping across her uniform, her face was aghast in shock and terror. As Jordan was dragged past her, clawing at her arms and then her feet, her terror turned to a warbling cry of agony.

The great brown bear tossed Jordan into the stairwell and lingered, glaring, casting a tall shadow that grew over Jordans ragdoll body and when it reached his eyes the world went black again.",1,1732711467.0,2ndStoicSchool,0,1.0,False

I bought the size the Live chat person suggested on the offical Red Wing website, i had to do this because i live in Newfoundland (Canada) and we do not have any Red Wing stores here so i had to order them online. I am a size 9US in most running shoes/sneakers and the red wing live chat suggested i get size 8E IR. When i first got them i read so many things that you need to wear 2 pairs of thick socks and tie them tight to break them in and so thats what i did - the first few times i wore them i couldn't wear them for more than 30 mins at a time, my feet would go numb then eventally they got a little more barable so i started wearing them to work and i found they really rubbed the back of my heels while walking so i didn't really wear them much after that, maybe once every week or two for a little run to the corner store or coffee shop but they still rubbed my feet and so i figured i had the wrong size but the online store i ordered them from didn't do exchanges. :(

Anyways I just started wearing them again and slowly bringing them back into my rotation maybe a month ago for the Fall and i figured i'd try something different this time around so i started laceing them up looser espically at the bottom closer to the toe, i still tie the very last loop around my ankle half tight but keep the others MUCH looser - BUT with the looser laces they actually fit WAY better, i didn't notice any painful heel rubbing and i could wear them for long periods of time with no issue which i couldn't do before. i think i prefer this style because i usually wear Blundstones and they are slip on Chelsea style boots that have a lot of movement and room in them so i guess i was just cranking the IR too tight because that's what i read i should do, either way i am very happy with this new method, they are still fully laced but not half as much as before (i had a lot of excess laces that i always just tucked back into the top of the boots) but whatever i can wear them all day painfree now and i'm very happy with that.

for anyone having BAD heel rub give this a try it might help with that it did for me.",0,1732711292.0,RedWingShoes,10,0.25,False

Tldr - my abusive relarionship destroyed my self worth and I now struggle to relax and just accept nice dating...

So I (32m) ended a 9 year relationship that for the last 3 years was emotionally abusive and (I suspect) even gave me a health condition I now have. They destroyed my self worth, criticised my appearance, criticised my earnings and worst of all criticised my dreams. In hindsight I have no idea why I held on. I've been in therapy for a year which has honestly been the biggest investment I've ever made. I ended it 9 weeks ago when a line was crossed (cheating).

They are now 3 states away, and I've blocked them in every way. No contact.

I drank wayyyy too much for a month whilst adjusting to my new normal but after 4 weeks felt like I'd been liberated from a cult. A huge weight lifted from my shoulders.

Through therapy and being out of my situation I realised I had felt single for at least 2 years in terms of intimacy (we hardly cuddled towards the last few years, sex was.. a couple times a month if that) 

Anyway 4 weeks out from escaping this my freinds persuaded me to download hinge whilst we were drinking at a bar, the next day I spent 15 mins or so swiping but being picky.

2 days later I got a match and a message from a woman with a funny opening line based on my profile. She is absolutely stunning but her personality via messages was also attractive.

After a bit of chat I think 'fuck it' and suggest coffee the next day. In my head I thought this would be a write off and just a 'first step' in remembering how to date. I went with no agenda other than 'getting back out there' and had zero plan.

We instantly hit it off, my nerves disappeared within about 5 minutes and we organically hung out for hours more than planned until the evening.

Again, thinking 'fuck it' I went for a kiss at the end that was reciprocated immediately.

We agreed to meet again the following weekend and went our separate ways with minimal texting in-between (we discussed texting and how we both don't like/want penpals)

The second date was even easier than before, I hadn't felt as authentically safe in being myself as I felt that night in years. I got up to get my last amtrak home and she said 'I was going to invite you back'

Before my 8 year relationship this would have terrified me (haha) but again, i thought 'fuck it'.

To avoid nswf.. I had an amazing night, experiencing intimacy I hadn't felt potentially ever. After sleeping together we laid in each others arms and chatted till the sun came up. I will honestly say that I didn't know sex could be as good as it was that night (lol) and the 'aftercare' was beyond words compared to my ex. She told me I was beautiful which a woman has never said to me before.

Fast forward to now and we've hung out two more times, this time in the day (I kinda liked this as it showed it wasn't just about sex)

I'm due to see her tomorrow night and stay over.

So people, the help I need is this.

I can't just accept this for what it is - a nice, organic connection between two people.

I can't accept someone being 'this nice' , in my quiet moments I find myself in a thought loop of anxiety about this 'going wrong' or making a mistake, I read my messages multiple times and anxiously await a response (working on this).

I'm terrified of my past abusive relationship bleeding into this new beginning. 

I can't help but take literally everything that has been said and has happen as not meaning anything - a defense mechanism I have as I sometimes expect to get a message any minute saying 'yh I'm not interested anymore'

I can't help wishing this had happened a few months later than it did.. this woman is awesome though so wouldn't change that.

I want to send a package to my partner who lives in Vancouver, BC. I live in the US, Tennessee to be exact. Last year I used FedEx but it was really expensive, around $70 usd, and he made me promise him I'd use a cheaper service, even if it took til January to get there.

This time I was considering using USPS but I am not sure if this will get hung up in shipping due to the strike. 

I am sending a mix of items. A shirt, a knit hat, socks, & scarf, a book, a mix of food things that are only available in my part of the US. Candy like GooGoo Clusters, local peanut butter cups, local fudge, a local hot sauce, a local tea and a coffee. Anything potentially messy should something go wrong will be in mailer packets/boxes inside the package itself.

Is there anything in this list that will incur any sort of customs taxes/VAT(?) that he might have to pay, and is there a way I can cover that so he doesn't have to? Just venmo him anything he might have to cover?

And if anyone that is from Canada or is familiar, do you think its likely the government will issue a return to work order? I want the strike to be resolved in favor of the workers,  but I'm just curious, as I may end up holding off until after the strike is resolved.

1h1356a,https://i.redd.it/2pvqpb5utf3e1.jpeg,That Time My Husband Declared His Love… In a Cappuccino? ☕,"When I first met my husband, he was managing a restaurant, and we were both completely giddy with infatuation. He’d call or text me to stop by for a coffee, and of course, I’d go—how could I resist? 😄

One day, I sat down with my cappuccino, and there it was: te quiero mucho written in the foam. My heart did a little flip—I was touched by the gesture, but then I started questioning myself:

“Wait… did he just declare his love for me on a cup of coffee?”

I couldn’t help but giggle. I was tickled by his genius—he knew I loved coffee, and I was already smitten with him. But then I thought, “Ooh… he moves fast!” 😅

If you’ve ever been in a cross-cultural relationship, you know moments like this can be both romantic and a little confusing. Spanish phrases like these carry their own layers of meaning, and understanding them can clear up those “wait, what does this really mean?” moments.

✨ Te quiero mucho: It’s like saying, “I care about you a lot” or “I really like you.” It’s affectionate and sweet but doesn’t necessarily mean “I love you” in the deep, romantic sense.

💖 Te amo: This is the serious one. It’s reserved for deep, soulful “I love you” moments—think life-changing connections and close family bonds.

Looking back, that little coffee moment is one of my favourite memories from the early days of our relationship. It captured the fun, layered, and sometimes hilarious journey of navigating love in a different language.

Have you ever had a moment like this where you weren’t quite sure if you were swooning or second-guessing? Or maybe been a little lost in translation when it comes to love? I’d love to hear your stories in the comments! 💌

I petitioned back in September after meeting a gentleman that to me seems a very authentic person and I still feel that way. The petition was submitted after I had coffee with the gentleman who is the Secretary of the Lodge I petitioned. 

After submission I waited and everyone has lives and I know this is a process. I went to a fundraising dinner and I got to know a few of the masons there. 

A month or so goes by and I eventually have my home visit , all seems well. 

In this time from petition to present I have intentionally not hung around the lodge as with my petition being in and the process taking its course I don’t want to make it look like I am
•pushy 
•hanging around to influence my petition 

I want the process to take its course and I relayed this to the secretary and he didn’t say one thing or another about my method of thought.

I went to another fundraising dinner last week and it was announced as it has been each time I go that on Tuesday they do dinner and everyone is welcome. 

So yesterday I talk to my fiancee and ask if she’d like to go, she agrees.

I message and ask if dinner is still on and the time and get two one word responses “yes” “630”.

I show up and go in and everyone is well dressed and it’s all the members. Needless to say I felt very out of place. I wasn’t dressed appropriately and it wasn’t made clear that yes people are welcome but on non fundraiser dinners it’s usually just the lodge. 

I made quick small talk with the WM but left quickly as I didn’t actually feel too welcome there. Some were friendly others were reserved which is understandable it’s their lodge. 

However I had to leave to get dinner as my fiancee was in the vehicle and I couldn’t just stay and she would have felt more uncomfortable than I , feeling out of place there. 

Afterwards I didn’t get any sort of communication as to why I left etc. Which isn’t required from anyone but would have been the charitable thing to do to make communication clear. 

At this point with the process , I do not know if I want to continue. I don’t expect anyone to reach out to me. But what I DO expect is , if it is proper that I reach out and get to know members better then that needs to be established as I don’t know protocol. 

Anyway if you have read this far I appreciate it. 

I’m not bashing Masons or the lodge I’m petitioning. I’m just trying to get insight and perspective from Masons with my current situation so I can understand it better. 

So my decision to continue or leave can be informed without my personal bias based on events viewed only through my lens.

I stumbled upon this subreddit about two weeks ago and it has completely changed my perspective on the Law of Assumption. Now, I want to share my story. Disclaimer: English is not my first language.

My manifestation journey began in 2019, the year I read *The Power of Your Subconscious Mind* by Joseph Murphy. I was in a really dark place at that time and this book gave me a huge amount of hope. Back then, I was also really into tarot readings, astrology, crystals and that kind of stuff. It never really brought anything meaningful into my life; it was just a form of escapism for my depressed mind. Now, I see that.

I lost interest in those things after a while. Obviously, I didn't manage to manifest anything significant – only things that, in hindsight, I now clearly see were coincidences.

I discovered Neville Goddard and the Law of Assumption at the beginning of last year. I’m not sure why, but it made complete sense to me. I believed in all of it immediately. I devoured all of the books and watched thousands of videos from our wonderful coaches. Thank God I was sane enough not to give them my money. Lol.

I isolated myself from everyone. I stayed in my room and fantasized about my desires. I neglected my life and my relationships for the sake of the Law.

Now, this might be controversial for some of you. I’m aware that many of you no longer believe in the Law, and I respect that.

I actually managed to manifest a lot of things, though not the big ones. I’m not sure if they were coincidences or not, and right now, I don’t really care. However, I still believe in some kind of connection between the human mind and the outer world. It probably doesn’t work the way Neville portrays it—or maybe it does. Maybe I don’t understand it and I’m the problem. Lol. Just kidding.

I left the community and stopped practicing for the sake of my mental health. It truly felt like I was walking away from a cult.

Like I said, I never managed to manifest anything significant – nothing more than seeing a butterfly or getting a cup of coffee. I tried so hard, but nothing happened. I affirmed, visualized and did SATS.

How miserable I felt. I truly believed that I could change my whole life by imagining things in my mind, without lifting a finger.

I took the Law to the extreme. I tried to manifest my celebrity crush and even attempted to change the shape of my nose. I was sitting in my room for hours, thinking about my celebrity crush. This is so embarrassing!

I neglected my health because I believed that I could heal my teeth with the power of my mind and that I didn’t have to worry about money. Now, I need two root canals. I guess I didn’t believe enough, right? (Don’t worry, I decided to do it the muggle way. I’m currently in the middle of treatment.)

I was delusional, and I feel embarrassed. I'm not mad at myself, though. I try to be understanding. It’s not my fault that I let it absorb me completely. I was desperate.

It has been two weeks, and I feel happier now. I still need a lot of time to process some things. I’m trying to accept that there are things in the world I have no control over and that’s fine. (The Law made me feel crazy because I wanted to control every little aspect of my life.)

I’m glad I’ve finally opened my eyes and this subreddit has helped me tremendously. Lots of love to all of you. Take care!",4,1732710254.0,NevilleGoddardCritics,1,1.0,False

There's good news and bad news.

I managed to do the presentation. Yay.

However, I still got a huge fight or flight response 1 minute before I had to talk. Like, I felt like I would not at all be able to talk, the anxiety in my body was enormous and my mind was racing to thoughts like ""If I just close Zoom, I can fake that the power went out"" and things like that.

Luckily as this happened, the previous presenter kept talking a bit more instead of handing it over to me, and I managed to do some breathing excersises and focus on silly things enough that when it became my turn, I could speak normally. This of course is nice and I'm happy that it's over ""for now"", but it still makes me dread the next time I have to talk, because now I feel like the Propranolol didn't really help at all, since I'm sure that if the previous presenter had just handed it over to me, without me having the 30-60 seconds to settle down, I would still have completely choked.

I would love to hear if this has happened to other people and how you tackled it?

For info, I took 10 mg. early in the day, then I took 20 mg. 4 hours before and 10 mg. 2 hours before the presentation. I also avoided coffee both the day before and on the day.",4,1732709912.0,PublicSpeaking,5,0.83,False
1h12ygq,https://www.reddit.com/r/expertskincaretips/comments/1h12ygq/top_winter_skincare_tips_for_glowing_skin/,Top Winter Skincare Tips for Glowing Skin,"Winter can take a toll on your skin, leaving it dry, flaky, and dull. Whether you live in the chilly mountains or experience mild Indian winters, maintaining a healthy glow requires the right skincare products and practices. In this guide, we’ll cover top winter skincare tips and highlight **the** [best skin care products in India](https://truedermasa.com/) tailored to protect and nourish your skin.

# 1. Understand Winter Skin Needs

Cold weather and low humidity can strip your skin of moisture, making it feel tight and dehydrated. To combat this, your skincare routine should focus on:

* **Hydration**: Use products that lock in moisture.
* **Nourishment**: Look for rich, creamy textures to protect against dryness.
* **Barrier Repair**: Support your skin's natural defenses to prevent irritation.

By choosing **India’s best skin care products**, you can ensure optimal results for glowing skin.

# 2. Cleansing: Go Gentle on Your Skin

Start with a gentle, hydrating cleanser that removes impurities without over-stripping natural oils. Avoid harsh soaps or foaming cleansers that can dry out your skin further.

I was wondering how light the roasts from Barn Berlin are. I see they have 25% off all coffee and was deciding whether it would be prudent to buy some. What are your experiences with them?  Are they very lightly roasted? I prefer as light as possible... What do you guys recommend from them?

I practiced keto a few years ago and after I brought my health more or less in order, I gave up this diet mostly because I'm overcome by boredom, if I can put it that way, that is, everything becomes somehow monotonous and bland in terms of emotion, I would even say that during this period emotions are almost absent or very muted. I associated all this with the fact that for a full hormonal background, some more carbohydrates are still necessary (I'm not talking about refined sugars and products that include them). Now, several weeks after my fast, I switched to keto due to health problems and the only way to feel normal I need bulletproof coffee. Is this reaction normal for the lack of carbohydrates or is it just me? Does anyone have experience with adding xylitol to bulletproof coffee?",2,1732709596.0,keto,1,1.0,False
