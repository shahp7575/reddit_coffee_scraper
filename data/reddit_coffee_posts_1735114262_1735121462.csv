Even outside the cities that house NFC North teams ‚Äì Chicago, Minneapolis, Green Bay ‚Äì the respect and love of Dan Campbell is clear. I‚Äôve heard similar confessions from fans in Houston, in Phoenix, in Dallas and in every city the Lions play.  

They are drawn to Campbell, to his presence on the sideline, to his news conferences after games, to his speeches in the locker room after games. Those couple-minute clips aren‚Äôt just must-watch viewing here, but wherever sports fans reside.  

... Against the Bears ... when receiver Jameson Williams drew a taunting penalty for spinning the football in front of officials after a first down catch ... A few minutes later, cameras caught Campbell standing next to Williams, his left arm around the young receiver‚Äôs back, his right hand attaboy slapping his chest. 
Campbell was giving him the business and giving him confidence at the same time. Balancing both, especially in the same moment, is a high-wire act, and aside from his obvious authenticity, the central reason he resonates. 

... Charles Barkley once described the feeling he gets watching Campbell as a ‚Äúman crush.‚Äù Fans around here simply have a crush. He is a kind of gift, and on this day of Christmas, it‚Äôs worth remembering how rare such gifts can be.  

... other athletes from other sports joke they‚Äôd love to play for him, even if they don‚Äôt want to play football. Who wants to get hit? ... so many fans joke that they‚Äôd like him to coach them in ... life. 

... The Athletic took a poll last year asking NFL players whom they‚Äôd most like to play for and Campbell ranked only behind those two. That he doesn‚Äôt have a ring yet, or even a Super Bowl appearance, speaks to the way he connects, and inspires.  

Campbell, of course, would downplay his singular combination of gifts. His ability to integrate traits from past eras with the demands of this one feels new, but he would never acknowledge it.  

He is often happy to let some think of him as a motivator only ... He doesn‚Äôt mind sharing the credit.  In fact, he thrives on it, and his willingness to give and deflect kudos is what Christmas is all about. Think of others ‚Äî and think of how best to help them thrive.

That spirit transmits through osmosis, to fans around here ... to various corners of the globe. But also to fans of other teams in other cities, like the driver who ferried me to the airport (his name is Steve), who held a warm feeling in his gut for a coach he‚Äôs never met, doesn‚Äôt follow on the daily, and coaches a team who just whipped his beloved Bears. 

‚ÄúHe is different,‚Äù Steve told me. 

A fact routinely acknowledged by those who cover him, who remember how he sounded during the 3-13-1 start, and remember he doesn‚Äôt sound any different now; he‚Äôs never made any of this about him. 

... Coaches ‚Äî in any sport ‚Äî don't come around often made for a particular moment, and made for a particular place.

... Double espresso coffee bombs and purse dogs? A baritone that cracks as the eyes well up? A multi-millionaire leader who pokes fun at himself? Humility and supreme confidence?  

Yeah, that‚Äôll do. And Merry Christmas, Lions fans.",1,1735121247.0,detroitlions,0,1.0,False

I was almost, almost sure about that to dodge ugly situations in this short period of time, until the morning today.
Took my time to quietly move away from my mom anw sibling talking about our father (they got divorced because he's an abusive, manipulating person) which way okay, but this time I didn't wanted to join.
This morning before taking off the train I planned to wake up and have an extra hour to get ready, go back to the city, and go to my partner's family dinner - at my first coffee my mother took the effort to traumadump on me, like she wanted to rob that time from me even waking up.
Through 45 minutes she was complaining about our father being so mean to her, and staying with him (20 years btw) she was standing up to him, blah-blah-blah. The monologue was about she did nothing wrong and protected us, which is very far awat from the truth. My sibling is still completely traumatized for living extra 10 years with our dad, and in secret they confessed me having suicidal toughts too. We both feel completely disfunctional and left alone, and it breaks my heart. And our mom who is a Frickin' THERAPIST is so into framing herself being this heroic parent, she's incabable to help any of us.
So, after rushing to the train station our mother was so eager to tell me that she got invited to another country where our 3rd (half) sibling lives, so they can surprise the second sibling together when they take off from work in February. So the 3 of them will be together, but it was never mentioned anybody ever thought inviting me too.
As the train started and being alone, I started crying. This happens so frequently, and I choose not to go NC with my mom, because of my 2nd sibling.
What I get is ""you should visit more,so we can talk abou your father"" like it's a healing session. No, it was never meant to be for healing.
I'm so tired of getting rid of an abusive parent, and have another one, who's stolen my tennage years to live her best life.

I'll be arriving soon, and take off the train. There's another family who invited me to come over. They are my partner's, and they actually love me a lot, this is both hard and very good to think of.
There's always love in this deranged world for us, even if our family does not. We got friends, mates, mutuals, partners, pets, and leaving behind what's needed is the best choice we can make.

The sound of screeching sirens ripped through the heavy fog of unconsciousness. Damon chest heaved as he sucked in air thick with smoke, the acid-like burn searing his lungs and drawing a sharp cough from his throat. Dust and debris clung to his skin, clouding his vision and muffling the world around him.

*What happened?* The thought felt distant as if his mind was moving in slow motion. His head throbbed with a dull ache, and when he reached up to cradle it, his hands trembled. The ground beneath him felt uneven and cold, littered with shattered concrete and jagged rubble.

Slowly, he pushed himself up, the weight of his body feeling alien, as if someone else had taken control of his limbs. His ears rang, a shrill reminder of the chaos he‚Äôd somehow lived through. He squinted, trying to make sense of the disorienting haze.

*Where am I?*

Through the smoke, the flicker of distant flames illuminated the wreckage: twisted metal, broken glass, and crumbled walls‚Äîa war zone of his own making.

*An explosion...* The memory hit like a punch to the gut. *That‚Äôs right. There was an explosion. But how? How am I still alive?*

He turned his head, left, then right. Nothing. Just smoke and debris stretching endlessly, the aftermath of destruction he‚Äôd somehow survived.

And then, like a cold wave crashing over him, the guilt set in. Sharp, unrelenting, it clawed at his chest, the weight of it sinking deeper with each passing second.

*I knew it was a bad idea. I knew it.*

His hands clenched into fists, trembling with the truth. *Why did I listen to him?*

The question hung heavy in the air, suffocating him. The distant wail of sirens grew louder, but their warning had come too late ""Damon stumbled through the wreckage, his movements unsteady and foreign, a far cry from the man he had been a month ago.""

¬†

The aroma of coffee filled the air, warm and familiar, as Damon wrapped his hands around the chipped mug. He took a slow sip, the bitterness cutting through the fog of his thoughts. The heat stung his tongue, but the sensation grounded him, a small comfort in the otherwise restless morning.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù Aunt Olivia‚Äôs voice broke the stillness. She leaned against the doorway, her smile easy, but her eyes betrayed her. Concern flickered there, gone almost as soon as it appeared.

‚ÄúHey, Aunt Olivia.‚Äù Damon offered her a small smile, setting the mug down on the counter. ‚ÄúJust trying to wake up. How about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm fine, same as always.‚Äù She stepped into the room, her voice carrying the steady reassurance he‚Äôd grown up with. It was the same tone she used when he was younger‚Äîwhen he‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night from a bad dream, or when she quietly paid the bills in full view, pretending they weren‚Äôt piling up.

‚ÄúYou should take a break,‚Äù Damon said, the words half-hearted but habitual. He knew better than most how much weight she carried, running the old hotel and keeping everything together. ‚ÄúYou work too hard.‚Äù

She paused, her fingers brushing over the back of a chair. ‚ÄúAnd you don‚Äôt?‚Äù she replied, her tone light but pointed. ‚ÄúDamon, there are people here who care about you. Don‚Äôt forget that.‚Äù

He shrugged off the sentiment, though it settled somewhere deep in his chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt worry so much.‚Äù

Aunt Olivia lingered for a moment, studying him with that quiet intensity he‚Äôd come to expect from her. Her expression softened, her lips curving into a small smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúIf you say so,‚Äù she murmured before turning back to her desk.

Damon watched her for a moment longer, his chest heavy with unspoken gratitude. He owed her everything‚Äîmore than words could ever convey. After his parents' mysterious deaths, she had stepped in without hesitation, identifying their bodies and sacrificing what little she had to keep him safe. And now, as much as she hated to admit it, she relied on him too. The thought gnawed at him, a quiet guilt simmering beneath his resolve, even as he told himself it was only fair. He owed her that much.

He finished his coffee, leaving the mug in the sink as he stepped outside. The crisp morning air nipped at his skin, the quiet hum of the hotel‚Äôs old boiler fading behind him. Mark was already waiting by the entrance, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his ever-present hoodie, the word *Lucky* emblazoned across the chest.

Outside, the sharp bite of morning air nipped at Damon‚Äôs skin as he stepped onto the cracked pavement. The acrid stench of sewage clashed with the choking fumes of city smog, creating a nauseating cocktail of filth.

¬†The city‚Äôs distant hum enveloped him‚Äîa stark reminder that life continued indifferently, no matter what chaos brewed in his. Mark was leaning casually against a brick wall nearby, his posture as relaxed as if it were any other day.  
""Morning, man,"" Mark greeted, his crooked grin breaking through the quiet like it could chase away the weight on Damon‚Äôs shoulders.

Damon nodded, trying to shake off the heaviness hanging in his chest. ""Ready to make some moves?""

""Always,"" Mark said with a faint smile, but something in his gaze made Damon hesitate. The moment passed quickly, but the unease lingered like a shadow in the back of his mind.

Mark pushed off from the wall and started down the street, his steps easy, like he already had the world figured out. ""Yo, man, I got a job for us today,"" he said, a gleam in his eye.

Damon raised an eyebrow, a familiar unease stirring in his gut. ""What kind of job?""

""You know old Dwayne up the block?"" Mark asked, his tone casual, but there was an edge to it.

Damon‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúYeah, the biggest runner in the city. What about him?‚Äù

Mark shot him a look‚Äîthe kind that said trouble was coming. Damon‚Äôs stomach dropped.

""No, you didn‚Äôt, man. How did you even‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got my ways,‚Äù Mark interrupted with a shrug, clearly enjoying Damon‚Äôs reaction. ""Point is, Dwayne‚Äôs willing to give us a shot. He heard about our last job steeling from the Ace hood Demons and was impressed.""

""Impressed?"" Damon‚Äôs voice was sharp. ""Mark, we almost died! My ears are still ringing from that bullet that missed my head by an inch!""

Mark rolled his eyes. ""Stop being a bitch, man. You know we can't get rich out here without taking some risks. Besides, if we pull this off, we'll be set for a long time. Didn‚Äôt you say you needed a vacation?""

Damon tried to steady his breathing, the temptation of a way out of the grind eating at him. ""How much is he offering?""

‚ÄúOne hundred thousand rupets,‚Äù Mark grinned.

The number hit Damon like a jolt of electricity. A hundred thousand. That kind of money could change everything.

The thought of helping Aunt Olivia, paying off the mounting debts, or maybe even getting a place of his own was tempting. He knew how much she struggled to keep the hotel running. But still, something about this didn‚Äôt sit right. A job like that, especially for low-level lifters like them, was bound to have consequences. Damon had learned long ago that easy money came with its own price.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, man,‚Äù he said, his voice low, his gut churning with suspicion. ‚ÄúSomething feels off.‚Äù

Mark gave a dismissive wave, like it was nothing. ""Damon, you're always worried. That‚Äôs gonna kill you someday. ¬†In the last ten years have I ever steered you wrong?""

Damon glanced at him, searching his friend‚Äôs face for signs of doubt, but found none. Mark was already lost in the daydream of how he'd spend his share, and Damon couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that this time, they might not be able to walk away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trusting you on this one,‚Äù Damon said reluctantly, though his voice carried the weight of uncertainty. ‚ÄúBut if things start to go south, we bail. Got it?‚Äù

Mark shrugged, his mind already a million miles away as they walked down the street. Damon‚Äôs mind, however, was racing.

The image of Aunt Olivia at her desk, the concern she hid behind her smile, kept replaying in his thoughts. One hundred thousand rupets could change things‚Äîcould help her, take the weight off both their shoulders. But was it worth the risk? And if it wasn‚Äôt, would he ever be able to face her again?

The image of Aunt Olivia sitting at her desk, her concern hidden behind a smile, wouldn‚Äôt leave him. One hundred thousand rupets could pay off the hotel‚Äôs debts. It could help her. But was it worth the risk? And if it wasn‚Äôt, would he ever be able to face her again?

Damon and Mark navigated the winding streets of New Lostrum, their steps growing more cautious with every turn. The city loomed around them, a paradox of beauty and brutality. Towering skyscrapers reached toward the heavens, their gleaming exteriors a testament to ambition‚Äîbut beneath the surface lay a rotting core. The High Society stood apart, its sectioned-off district fortified with walls and weapons that radiated power and authority, a stark reminder of the divide.

To the untrained eye, the city might seem like a haven‚Äîa gritty but promising refuge. Damon, however, knew better. New Lostrum had a way of swallowing people whole. They came and went, and some simply disappeared, leaving behind only unanswered questions and uneasy whispers.

Mark, still riding the high of their potential payout, shot Damon a sly grin. It was the same one Damon had seen a hundred times before, but this time, there was a hint of caution in it.

‚ÄúYo, when we get there, don‚Äôt get all weird on me, alright?‚Äù Mark said. ‚ÄúJust let me do the talking. Everything will be fine.‚Äù

Damon pulled himself from his thoughts, annoyance creeping in. ‚ÄúYou act like this is my first job.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs chuckle was dry, forced. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just making sure your head‚Äôs in the game. We both need this to go smooth.‚Äù

As they neared Dwayne‚Äôs hideout, the air grew thick with tension. The streets seemed darker‚Äînot from the lack of light, but from the weight of the atmosphere. The people changed too: furtive glances, hurried steps, whispered words. The neighborhood was a far cry from the hustle and bustle of the city center.

Damon‚Äôs eyes drifted to a pair huddled near the sidewalk, heads bent low over a duffle bag. Through the thin plastic, he could make out the shape of tightly packed bundles. He didn‚Äôt need to look closely to know what was inside.

*Another deal going down,* Damon thought, his lips pressing into a tight line. *We must be getting close.*

When they finally stopped in front of their destination, Damon raised an eyebrow. The building stuck out like a sore thumb, a clash of garish red paint and flashing neon signs. The exterior was plastered with silhouettes of women in suggestive poses, their allure thinly veiling the desperation that clung to the air.

¬†‚ÄúA bit early for booze and naked women, wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù Damon muttered.  
Mark‚Äôs chuckle broke through the tension, though it didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes. ‚ÄúYou know me well enough to know that‚Äôs never the case.‚Äù  
Damon scanned the building once more, skepticism creasing his brow. ‚ÄúBit of a clich√©, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Mark shrugged, unfazed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just today. No telling where he‚Äôll be tomorrow. Come on, we can‚Äôt be late for this.‚Äù

As they neared the door, Mark‚Äôs usual carefree swagger seemed to fade. There was a new weight to his steps, a seriousness that felt heavier than it should. Damon noticed the shift‚Äîa focused determination in his friend‚Äôs gait, like they were about to step into a trap.

*Shit,* Damon thought, his stomach tightening.

He followed, his unease growing with every step.

Knock. Knock... Knock.

The final knock echoed, unnervingly loud in the quiet of the street. Passersby slowed their steps, curiosity flashing in their eyes, but none of them dared linger. The seconds stretched, thick with anticipation, before the door finally creaked open.

A woman stood before them. She was striking‚Äîtoo striking. She wore only a bra and a pair of shorts that barely clung to her hips. Her hair was tousled, but her makeup was flawless, a sharp contrast to the indifference in her cold, appraising gaze. She looked like a cover model, but her beauty only added to the tension.

Without a word, she raised her hand in a lazy motion, a silent command for them to enter.

Damon‚Äôs eyes lingered for a moment, too long. As she turned to lead them in, the gleam of a Glock 19 holstered at her waist caught his eye. It was a small, casual detail, but the weight of it sent an involuntary chill down his spine.

*So much for charm,* Damon thought grimly.

But before he could think further, the sound of a safety being clicked off froze him in place.

Click.

Damon‚Äôs stomach dropped, a cold rush of dread sweeping over him. Slowly, he raised his hands, a silent signal that he was unarmed. He turned his head just enough to see a massive man standing behind him, built like a tank. The Glock in his hand was steady, aimed without hesitation.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Damon hissed under his breath, teeth clenched as his mind raced for a way out.

Mark had his hands up too, his cocky grin now gone, replaced by a grimace. The woman had leveled her weapon at his face, her expression still detached‚Äîlike she was waiting for the next task, indifferent to the tension in the room.

Damon shot Mark a glare that could‚Äôve cut steel. *‚Äòeverything‚Äôll be fine?‚Äô*

In that instant, Damon made a decision. *I‚Äôm not dying here today.* He spun around quickly, using his raised arm to knock the gun out of the way. With the motion, he grabbed the man‚Äôs arm and disarmed him in one fluid motion, clicking the Glock back on safety. Then, without hesitation, Damon delivered three swift elbows to the man‚Äôs face.

The man staggered back, dazed, giving Damon enough time to realize his advantage. The tank of a man didn‚Äôt notice at first, too stunned to register that Damon had stolen his weapon. But then the unmistakable sound of the gun‚Äôs barrel clicking into place filled the air.

A loud, deliberate *clunk* rang out.

The room fell silent.

A slow, mocking clap broke the tension.

‚ÄúClap, clap, clap.‚Äù The sound was slow and deliberate, each clap cutting through the tension like a knife. A booming voice followed, dripping with mock admiration. ‚ÄúNow that was impressive.‚Äù

Damon‚Äôs adrenaline still coursed through his veins, his breath ragged as he snapped his head upward. His eyes searched the shadowed balcony above, narrowing as they caught the faint outline of a figure watching from the darkness.

The voice echoed again, reverberating off the walls like a challenge. Damon‚Äôs chest tightened as recognition dawned. There he was, the man of the hour.

We usually meet at 12 or 12:30 which is considered normal lunch time I think. Today at 11am she suggested we meet at 1:30pm because her husband will be back by 1pm and she can only leave after that. That was too late for lunch so I suggested we meet for coffee later in the afternoon. When we finally met, I asked her what came up today for her husband and she replied that he wanted to go to the gym at 12pm. She did not say sorry for messing up our lunch plans, or acknowledge in any manner that she basically cancelled our lunch plans so that her husband can go to the gym.

She also showed up 10 mins late and did not acknowledge that either. Besides, when I share something about myself or what I‚Äôve been upto she does not show any curiosity and does not ask me anything about it. 

I was her mentor for some years - that‚Äôs how we became friends - and she still comes to me for career advice but never ever acknowledges it. I take my mentors out for lunch once in a while or give them a gift in the holiday season to show my appreciation. She never did any of this.

The wntire time she has been double checking and careful, and I took DAO for meals that could have something that would raise my bucket, still avoiding my biggest triggers.
Now I can tolerate espresso, and usually just have one small cup of coffee a day, with very little sugar (or honey), lactose free milk, and a bit of vanilla for flavouring. Or just plain with milk depending. 
She has a machine that is worse quality of mine (I don't get why she loves it so much, she also has normal moka machines that make much betteer coffee and are much cheaper), capsule based, and I have been careful to only have the small espresso capsules and nothing else (sadly not having coffee automatically gives me a migraine, but again, I tolerate one cup without any symptoms). 
Today she thought it would be nice to bring me coffee to wake me up before we go out to my grandma. Which is lovely! The coffee tasted a bit odd, and I initially thought it was hazelnuts, which I dislike; but since they are rated loe on the SIGHI list I can endure and drink just to make her happy.
But I ask her anyway: what's in this?
... chocolate.
It was chocolate.
Immediate reaction from me and my husband that I can't have chocolate.
She knows this, I gave her lists, I have been talking about my intolerance for the past three days cause people have been curious. She is aware.
She claims that ""chocolate flavouring is not the same as chocolate so it's okay."" I didn't know how to explain to her that in most cases it was often worse, and that chocolate flavouring is still made with cocoa in most cases. She says she is careful and would never give me chocolate. 
Except... chocolate coffee. She really didn't have to she has like twelve different capsule types, including the espresso ones I can have, vanilla types, etc. 

Now I am feeling a head pressure which is usually a precursor of a headache, which is what I get when I eat chocolate (that, and brain fog). I am not very happy about this.
She said ""well then just pop in one of those pills of yours!"" 
I didn't even bother explaining to her that DAO are supposed to be taken BEFORE food and are not a patch for after meals. 

I am having lunch with my grandma and I really hope I won't have a full blown headache by then. Merry crisis to me.

- I received the Barn & Silo and the Greenhouse as early Christmas presents 
- I made the custom 2D character/animal/‚Äúother‚Äù standees

1hlxlm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1hlxlm4/excerpt_from_without_god_michel_houellebecq_and/,"Excerpt from Without God: Michel Houellebecq and Materialist Horror by Louis Betty (3 Religion and Utopia II)
","**3**

**Religion and Utopia**

...

*Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon.* Like Charles Fourier, Saint-Simon envisions his utopia in religious terms. In Saint-Simon‚Äôs case, however, bringing about earthly paradise depends not on the arcane metaphysical abstractions of Fourier‚Äôs theories of harmony and passionate attraction, but rather on a concerted ‚Äúdetheologizing‚Äù of the Christian faith. The connection between Houellebecq and Saint-Simon is more analogic than literal, for never in Houellebecq‚Äôs novel does one discover any interest in rejuvenating a hope of eternal life. Rather, the comparison to be drawn between the two writers relates to their broader attitudes toward metaphysics and individualism, both symptoms of the collapse of medieval civilization and the ensuing epistemological confusion of modernity.

Central to Saint-Simon‚Äôs criticism of contemporary Christianity was his assertion that both its Catholic and Protestant versions were heresies. Catholicism had allowed itself to become obsessed with theological and doctrinal minutiae (Saint-Simon 1997, 126), with Protestantism had diminished the social importance of Christianity by placing the personal relationship between human and God above the good of society (158). Gaining eternal life is no more a matter of reciting prayers in Latin, eating fish on Fridays, or self-flagellation than it is of professing the proper creed (153-54). Instead, admittance to God‚Äôs eternal kingdom hinges on one‚Äôs commitment to bettering the human species, especially its poorest classes: ‚ÄúTrue Christianity commands all men to behave as brothers to each each; Jesus Christ has promised eternal life to those who shall have most contributed to the amelioration of the existence of the poorest class on the moral and physical level‚Äù (115, my translation). Saint-Simon‚Äôs gospels, which he calls ‚ÄúNouveau Christianisme,‚Äù is more social than theological: once the ‚Äúpurification‚Äù of Christianity is complete‚Äîthat is, once the religion has been freed from its theological fetters and social morality has become the principal duty and concern of the believer‚ÄîChristianity could be employed to combat political powers that privilege personal and private interests at the expense of the general good (163). The Catholic Church had promoted dogma over social justice and was concerned with a heavenly paradise at the expense of the kingdom of God on earth (163). Reformed Christianity, on the other hand, had placed one‚Äôs relationship with God above one‚Äôs duty to society, putting Christianity ‚Äúoutside the bounds of social organization‚Äù (158). Both traditions depart from the humanistic, world message of the Gospels, and thus Saint-Simon considers them heretical.

For Houellebecq, the dangers of metaphysics lie not in ecclesiastical obscurantism but rather in the ontology of materialism pervading modernity. Saint-Simon preaches that the only sure path to salvation is service to humanity‚Äôs most downtrodden classes; accordingly, he presents his doctrine as ‚Äúcalled upon \[‚Ä¶\] to anathematize theology, to classify as impious any doctrine who object it is to teach men means of gaining eternal life other than that of working with all their strength for the betterment of their fellow man‚Äôs existence‚Äù (1997, 154). In *The Elementary Particles,* the entry into eternal life‚Äîthat is, into the life of the new clone society‚Äîrequires a repudiation of the ‚Äúmetaphysics of materialism‚Äù in favor of a new understanding of reality in which the notions of matter and separation are replaced by new concepts of interweaving and infinite belonging. Djerzinksi writes in his fictitious *Meditations on Interweaving,*

* Uneducated man \[‚Ä¶\] is terrified of the idea of space; he imagines it to be vast, dark and yawning. He imagines beings in the elementary forms of spheres, isolated in space, curled up in space, crushed by the eternal presence of three dimensions \[‚Ä¶\]. In this space of which they are so afraid, human beings learn how to live and die; in their mental space, separation, distance and suffering are born \[‚Ä¶\]. Love binds, and it binds forever. Good binds, while evil unravels. Separation is another word for evil; it is also another word for deceit. All that exists is a magnificent interweaving, vast and reciprocal. (251)

By repudiating supposedly metaphysical notions, such as matter, dimensionality and space, the human being realizes his or her absolute interconnectivity with the rest of the human world. The metaphysics of materialism, inherited from Newtonian conceptions of matter but superseded by the revelations of quantum physics, do no more than stand in the way of an honest appraisal of human ontology and the means of improving it. For Saint-Simon, the metaphysics of church dogma distract the believer‚Äôs attention from social justice and draw it toward his or her reward in the world to come. In *Particles,* the belief in matter must be abandoned if humanity is to overcome the forces of social atomization and be born anew in an era of infinite intersubjectivity.

Both Houellebecq and Saint-Simon trace the rise of modern individualism to the decline of Christianity at the end of the medieval period. Saint-Simon argues that the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity represented a gradual relinquishment of social concerns in favor of individual rights:

* From the establishment of Christianity until the fifteenth century, the human species concerned itself principally with the harmonization of its general sentiments \[‚Ä¶\]. Since the fifteenth century, the human mind has broken loose of the most general views; it has given itself over to specialties, it has concerned itself with the analysis of the personal matters, the private interests of the different classes of society \[‚Ä¶\] and, during this second period, the opinion has been established that considerations about general facts, about the general principles and general interests of the human species, were only vague and metaphysical considerations, unable to contribute to the progress of enlightenment \[‚Ä¶\]. (1997, 184)

Houellebecq renders the phenomenon somewhat more obliquely, though like Saint-Simon he marks the beginning of the decline in the fifteenth century:

* Though it may be difficult for us to understand this now, it is important to remember how central the notions of ‚Äúpersonal freedom,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman dignity‚Äù and ‚Äúprogress‚Äù were to the people in the age of materialism (defined as the centuries between the decline of medieval Christianity and the publication of Djerzinsky‚Äôs work). The confused and arbitrary nature of these ideas meant, of course, that they had little practical or social function‚Äîwhich might explain why human history from the fifteenth to the twentieth centuries was characterized by progressive decline and disintegration. (2000a, 258-59)

The transition to our era of individual concerns is thus a process of moral and social deterioration. As it has moved away from medieval Christianity, Western civilization has become progressively atomized, attempting to grant attention to the limited concerns of individual parties. Human rights are an ad hoc replacement for divine sanction, and their failure to have any ‚Äúpractical or social function‚Äù lies in the problem of their legitimation. The difference between Houellebecq and Saint-Simon is merely in their choice of terms: where Saint-Simon speaks of secondary principles, Houellebecq invokes the concept of rights. Both are unsatisfactory alternatives to a divine power capable of commanding the social order.

Fourier‚Äôs and Saint-Simon‚Äôs prescriptions for social progress and reorganization are accompanied by theological elements that, though not always formulated in explicit creedal statements, make both thinkers‚Äô utopianism religious and dualistic in character. **For Fourier, human relationships are to be harmonized according to the laws of passionate attraction, which God set forth in his design of the universe. In Saint-Simon‚Äôs case, the improvement of the condition of the poor requires maintaining allegiance to the original intent of the Gospels and focusing Christianity on social justice rather than on theological abstractions. Fourier and Saint-Simon also hold out hope for nonabstract forms of eternal life, which distinguishes them significantly from the utopian and social theory of Comte. In Fourier‚Äôs case, the earth‚Äôs departed hover about their home planet in the hope that their incarnate brethren will achieve harmony; for Saint-Simon, and especially for the explicitly religious Saint-Simonian movement that followed his death, the rewards of the world to come are linked to one‚Äôs treatment of this world‚Äôs poor.** Houellebecq may follow these thinkers in their worries over capitalism and metaphysics, their celebration of the feminine, and their critique of individualism, but he cannot embellish his representations of utopia with allusions to the will of a creator God or with a promise of eternal life beyond the physical body. **It is only in Comte, whose thought shares so much with his utopian predecessors yet whose atheism and physicalism represent an evolution toward the secular socialism of Marxism, that Houellebecq finds a true ally**.



*Auguste Comte.* Widely credited with having invented the field of sociology, Comte is today known principally as the originator of the *loi des trois etapes,* or law of the three stages. Comte‚Äôs vast philosophy, presented in his massive *Course in Positive Philosophy* (1830-42), and the more succinct *General View of Positivism* (1848), holds that civilization has progressed through three stages of historical development: the theological, the metaphysical, and finally the scientific or ‚Äúpositive.‚Äù The theological stage was the pre-Enlightenment and prerevolutionary period of European history, when the will of God (refracted, to be sure, through the policies of the church) was the final word in matters of justice and morality.

In the subsequent metaphysical stage, which Comte associates with postrevolutionary France, the notion of ‚Äúrights‚Äù began to emerge as a replacement for divine sanction. Comte considers the doctrine of human rights set forth during the revolution to represent a groping for a new principle in which to root notions of morality and social order; rights are necessarily vague and abstract in character, having no divine sanction from which to derive their authority, but they nonetheless reveal an effort on the part of postrevolutionary society to escape the arbitrariness of divine will. Thus, in Comte‚Äôs perspective, the striving for clarity and emancipation inherent in the metaphysical stage leads to a positive era in which the notion of rights disappears in favor of a system of morality based on a ‚Äúscience of society.‚Äù

The positive stage culminates in the religion of humanity, a secular-religious system centered on the worship of the social body and intended, much like Robespierre‚Äôs Cult of the Supreme Being, to offer an alternative to what Comte perceives to be a defunct Catholicism. Comte embellishes his religion with a positivist calendar and creates a ‚Äúpositivist catechism that mimics Catholicism in its inclusion of seven sacraments and a ‚Äúholy trinity,‚Äù replacing Father, Son, and Holy Spirit with Altruism, Order, and Progress. Comte‚Äôs new religion met with some success in France and Brazil, but like other secular alternatives to religion that emerged during the nineteenth century, its social significance today is all but nonexistent.

Comte views monotheism as nothing less than social poison. Not only does it represent the vestiges of ‚Äúinitial theologism‚Äù (the primitive worldview of both the prepositive and premetaphysical eras; 1968, 330), but monotheism‚Äôs continuing influence also directly impedes progress. Comte is unsparing in his condemnation:

* Their God has become the \[‚Ä¶\] leader of a hypocritical conspiracy, now more ridiculous than odious, which is trying hard to distract the people from all great social improvements by preaching to them a fanciful compensation \[‚Ä¶\]. Every theological trend, Catholic, Protestant, or deist, leads in reality to the prolongation and aggravation of moral anarchy, while impeding the decisive influence of social sentiment and collective spirit \[‚Ä¶\] There is now no subversive utopia that does not take root or sanction in monotheism. (398)

The monotheistic camp is, for Comte, ‚Äúretrograde and anarchic,‚Äù a domain where ‚ÄúGod presides vaguely,‚Äù while the religion of humanity, freedom from all theological fetters and from vain talk of ‚Äúfanciful compensation‚Äù (i.e., personal immortality), is ‚Äúorganic and progressive, systematically devoted to Humanity‚Äù (398).

From his declaration in *Lire* that monotheism is the ‚Äúact of a moron‚Äù to the Egyptian biochemist‚Äôs rant against Islam in *Platform,* Houellebecq has demonstrated in both fiction and nonfiction a loyalty to atheism that only finds nuance in his most recent public comments. For example, in ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai un reve,‚Äù a short essay describing his personal version of eternal life, Houellebecq writes,

* In my dream of eternal life, nothing much happens. Perhaps I‚Äôm living in a cave. Yes, I like caves, inside they‚Äôre dark and cool and I feel safe. I often wonder if there has been any real progress since the time of a cavemen. As I‚Äôm seated there, listening calmly to the sound of the sea, surrounded by friendly creatures, I think of all the things I‚Äôd like to removed from this world: fleas, birds of prey, money and work. Also probably porno films and belief in God. (2009, 179-80, my translation)

But however much Houellebecq may denigrate the notion of the one God in certain comments, he nevertheless laments God‚Äôs absence in other places.

Particularly liable to disparagement is Comte‚Äôs abstract vision of eternal life, wherein personal immortality is replaced by a theoretical perpetuation in human memory‚Äîwhat Comte refers to as the sacrament of ‚ÄúIncorporation‚Äù:

* Comte \[‚Ä¶\] failed totally and miserably. A religion with no God may be possible \[‚Ä¶\]. But none of this seems to me to be conceivable without a belief in eternal life, the belief that in all monotheistic religions acts as the great *introductory offer,* because once you‚Äôve conceded that, and with this as your goal, everything seems possible \[‚Ä¶\]. Comte wasn‚Äôt offering anything like that; all he proposed was one‚Äôs theoretically living on in the memory of mankind \[‚Ä¶\]. Well, that just didn‚Äôt cut it. (Houellebecq and Levy 2011, 166)

The trouble with abstract forms of immortality, Houellebecq writes to Levy, is that ‚Äúno one gives a shit‚Äù (166). Caught up as he was in the ideological fervor surrounding the birth of socialism, Comte was able to celebrate the supposedly incipient demise of monotheism and its promise of personal immortality. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the era afforded Comte the luxury of reveling in God‚Äôs death, while in Heouellebecq‚Äôs novels all that remains is a sense of postmodern fatalism, the memory of failed utopias, and a persistent, terrifying awareness of looming annihilation.

**Comte‚Äôs thought also informs much of Houellebecq‚Äôs discussion of rights. The notion of ‚Äúright‚Äù for Comte is a theological construct whose only sanction is in divine will**: ‚ÄúThe word *right* must be separated from true political language as much as the word *cause* from true philosophical language. Of these two \[‚Ä¶\] notions, the first is \[‚Ä¶\] immoral and anarchic, as the other is irrational and sophistical \[‚Ä¶\]. So long as earthly powers do not emanate from supernatural will, there can exist no real rights‚Äù (1968, 361). **Without a creator God to affirm them, rights are no more than a shaky human conception subject to the whims of history and human preference‚Äîwhat Comte calls ‚Äúarbitrary wills‚Äù (368). Instead, Comte proclaims that ‚Äúin the positive state, which no longer admits heavenly titles, the idea of rights disappears irrevocably. Each has his duties, and toward all; but no one has any right‚Äù (361). He even goes on to assert that ‚Äúno one possesses any other right than that of always doing his duty‚Äù (361). Rights are therefore to cede to a conception of morality rooted not in metaphysical abstractions or spiritual fictions but in concrete social laws demonstrated through the process of social scientific inquiry**: ‚ÄúThe necessary superiority of demonstrated morality over revealed morality can therefore be summed up as the definitive substitution of the love of Humanity for the love of God‚Äù (356).

The treatment of rights and their moral corollaries follows in the same spirit in Houellebecq‚Äôs fiction. While the clone narrator of *Particles* derides modern concepts like ‚Äúpersonal freedom‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman dignity‚Äù as ‚Äúconfused and arbitrary‚Äù (258), the Supreme Sister of *Possibility* dismisses belief in human rights as a simplistic illusion: ‚ÄúAdmit that men have neither dignity nor rights; that good and evil are simple notions, scarcely theorized forms of pleasure and pain‚Äù (31). Daniel1 takes the Supreme Sister‚Äôs observation even further, declaring, ‚ÄúAs for *human rights,* quite obviously I couldn‚Äôt give a toss; I could hardly manage to be interested in the rights of my cock‚Äù (16). The absence of a discourse of rights does not, however, rule out the existence of moral absolutes, as the reader discovers in the person of young Michel Djerzinski: ‚Äúreading Nietzsche provoked only a brief irritation, and Kant served only to confirm what he already knew: that perfect morality is unique and universal. Nothing is added to it and nothing changes over the course of time \[‚Ä¶\]. Not determined, it determines; not conditioned, it conditions. It is \[‚Ä¶\] an absolute‚Äù (2000a, 28). Houellebecq has recapitulated Djerzinski‚Äôs point of view in his comments to Levy:

* The rights of man, human dignity, the foundation of politics, I‚Äôm leaving all that aside, I have no theoretical ammunition, nothing that would allow me to validate such standards \[‚Ä¶\]. This leaves ethics, and there, I do have something. Only one thing, to be honest, luminously identified by Schopenhauer, and that is *compassion.* Rightly exalted by Schopenhauer and rightly vilified by Nietzsche as the source of all morality. I sided‚Äîand this is hardly news‚Äîwith Schopenhauer (2011, 168)

**Like Comte, Houellebecq holds out the possibility of establishing a system of morality without divine or metaphysical sanction‚Äîthat is, without commandments and rights, respectively.** ‚ÄúComplete atheists,‚Äù Houellebecq explains to Levy, ‚Äúwho are \[‚Ä¶\] convinced of their irremediable mortality, still go on believing in love \[and\] in moral law and behaving according to its tenets‚Äù (145). Following Schopenhauer in his celebration of compassion, rather than reason, as the basis of morality, Houellebecq affirms an innate moral sensibility that exists in the absence of a divine moral absolute.

Finally, Comte and Houellebecq show similarities in their thinking about women and female nature. Where Houellebecq declares, ‚Äú\[I\]t seems to me desirable that we should return to a matriarchal society‚Äù (Houellebecq 1998, n.p., my translation), Comte writes of women, ‚ÄúThis sex is certainly superior to ours regarding the most fundamental attribute of the human species, the tendency to make sociability prevail over personality. In this moral sense \[‚Ä¶\] it deserves our tender veneration, as the purest and most direct instance of Humanity‚Äù (1968, 210). Like Fourier, Comte views the ascendancy of women as a supreme indicator of progress, and the veneration of female nature as an important aspect of positivist worship. Houellebecq evokes Comte‚Äôs view in *The Elementary Particles,* in which Djerzinkski muses that ‚Äúwomen were indisputably better than men‚Äù (137) and that ‚Äúwomen were indisputably better than men‚Äù (137) and that ‚Äúa world of women would be immeasurably superior‚Äù (137). However, the discourse of female superiority in the novel takes an extreme turn in its embrace of the ‚Äúall-female‚Äù society, a notion Houellebecq borrows from the radical feminist thinker Valerie Solanas. In his introduction to the *SCUM Manifesto,* Houellebecq writes,

* For \[Solanas\] \[‚Ä¶\] woman is not only different, she is *superior.* Biological accident, *femme manquee,* man is an emotional invalid, incapable of concern, compassion, or love for others \[‚Ä¶\]. Man is a monkey armed with a machine gun. In keep with his violent and selfish nature, in this way he has succeeded in transforming the world, to borrow Valerie‚Äôs cutting expression, into a ‚Äúgigantic pile of shit.‚Äù (2009, 167, my translation)

Houellebecq extends Comte‚Äôs celebration of the feminine into a parallel condemnation of masculinity and the apparent disaster it has wrought on civilization. For a character such as Djerzinski, the question is no longer one of harmonizing male and female natures, but rather one of suppressing masculinity in order to establish an era of permanent progress.

Numerous other domains exist in which Comte‚Äôs and Houellebecq‚Äôs thought follow each other closely, and one could write an entire book detailing the latter‚Äôs intellectual debt to the former. More generally, however, the greatest commonality between the two writers lies in their sense of historical narrative‚Äîwhich Houellebecq expresses explicitly in *The Elementary Particles* and more implicitly in other works‚Äîwhich identifies the decline of Christianity as the central event of Western modernity. George Chabert writes in reference to *Particles,*

* What \[‚Ä¶\] is the immediate implication of the questioning of Christianity? This is in fact the main subject of Houellebecq‚Äôs narrative \[‚Ä¶\]. Here is how all this comes together in the course of the centuries: the Enlightenment philosophers deliver a fatal blow to a crisis-stricken Christianity, replacing Christian values with such here-and-now values as freedom and \[‚Ä¶\] equality. Man‚Äôs value, now circumscribed in his person, releases him from constraining social bonds, facilitating as such the substitution of an agricultural economy with a capitalist economy. Human rights \[‚Ä¶\] are only an alleged ruse of history. With the development of liberal society, man perceives himself more and more powerfully as an *elementary particle.* (2002, 194-95, my translation)

The difference, then, between Comte and Houellebecq is not in their diagnosis of Western malaise, but rather in the confidence each thinker brings to the possibility of a solution to the decline of the Christian worldview. Like other utopians of his time, Comte expresses great enthusiasm for his remedy to France‚Äôs spiritual mal de siecle: ‚ÄúLiving for others becomes the supreme form of happiness. To incorporate oneself intimately into Humanity, find fellow feeling with past tribulations, sense new destinies, while contributing actively to their realization, will constitute the routine goal of every existence‚Äù (1968, 353). **Houellebecq, on the other hand, can only mourn the naivete of such assurance. History has vanquished Christianity, belief in eternal life has buckled beneath the pressure of materialism, and modernity‚Äôs attempts to create compelling alternatives to the Christian worldview (liberalism, socialism, etc.) have been unable to fill the epistemological breach that God‚Äôs death has opened. Houellebecq‚Äôs readers find themselves in profoundly postmodern country, with nothing to guide them except a vague notion of individual freedom that has degraded into a source of permanent anxiety**.

Houellebecq can only follow Comte and his nineteenth-century cohort so far, for the fervor surrounding these thinkers‚Äô religious or quasi-religious utopianism has vanished in the wake of the twentieth century‚Äôs great ideological catastrophes. **Houellebecq may second Comte‚Äôs diagnosis of Western malaise, but the hope and excitement that fueled the utopian movements of the nineteenth century elude him**. This irreconcilable difference is captured in a memorable scene from *The Map and the Territory,* during which Jeb Martin notes the contents of Houellebecq‚Äôs personal library:

* They went back into the living room to have some coffee. Houellebecq added two logs to the fire, then went away to busy himself in the kitchen. Jeb went back to examining the bookcase, and was surprised by the small number of novels‚Äîclassics, essentially. However, there was an astonishing number of books by social reformers of the nineteenth century: the best known, like Marx, Proudhon, and Comte, but also Fourier, Cabet, Saint-Simon, Pierre Leroux, Owen, Carlyle, as well as others whose names meant almost nothing to him. (2012, 161)

All the great utopian tomes sit peacefully on their shelves, no longer of the slightest utility or interest to contemporary man. **Houellebecq read them all, admired them, and, in the end, consigned them to the cruel verdict of history. As the fictional Houellebecq confesses to Jed, ‚ÄúYou know what Comte asserts \[‚Ä¶\] that mankind‚Äôs dead outnumber the living. Well, I agree with him now. Above all I‚Äôm in contact with the** [**dead**](https://youtu.be/hibB_xqCMSE?si=Rb2LK54qnKcxCDTO)**‚Äù** (161) The quest for man‚Äôs salvation in the absence of God is finished. All that remains is to resign oneself to suffering, death, and nothingness.

\[To be continued‚Ä¶Abandoned Utopias\]

### Climate and Weather

Your environment plays a crucial role in your hydration needs. Hot and humid weather causes increased perspiration, leading to greater water loss. In contrast, cold weather can also lead to dehydration, as the body uses more water to maintain optimal temperature. Consider these factors:

- In warmer climates, increase daily water intake to avoid dehydration.
- In colder climates, pay attention to hydration, especially during physical activities.

### Dietary Choices

Your food choices also affect your water requirements. Consuming a diet high in salt or sugar can lead to increased thirst, making hydration more critical. Consider these dietary influences on hydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Foods with high water content like fruits and vegetables can contribute significantly to your daily intake. For example, cucumbers and watermelon contain over 90% water.
- Conversely, consuming processed foods high in salt may require you to drink more water to balance your body's sodium levels.

### Health Status and Medical Conditions

Your health can greatly influence how much water you need. Specific medical conditions can either require increased fluid intake or reduce your hydration needs. Some conditions include:

- **Kidney Issues:** If you have kidney problems, your doctor may recommend a controlled water intake.
- **Fever, Vomiting, or Diarrhea:** These can lead to dehydration, requiring you to drink more fluids to recover.
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pregnant and breastfeeding women have higher fluid needs to support their body's demands.

### Body Composition

Your body makeup affects how much water you need. Individuals with higher muscle mass may require more water than those with higher body fat percentages. Muscle tissues are composed of about 75% water, while fat tissues contain only about 10%. Therefore, it‚Äôs beneficial to consider:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- The more active and muscular you are, the more water you will need.
- Bodyweight can also serve as a guideline; a general recommendation is to drink approximately 30-35 milliliters of water for every kilogram of body weight.

Recognizing these factors can help you tailor your water intake to match your unique needs. Staying properly hydrated is vital for overall health, supporting essential bodily functions such as digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation. Keep in mind that thirst is often a late indicator of dehydration, so pay attention to your body's cues and make hydration a priority each day. By understanding what influences your water needs, you‚Äôll be better equipped to maintain optimal hydration for health and wellness.

Myths and Facts About Drinking Water
------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, drinking water is often surrounded by a mix of myths and facts. Many people strive to drink enough water every day, but conflicting information can make it hard to know what is truly accurate. Understanding the differences between myths and facts helps you make the best choices for your health.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

While the ‚Äú8x8‚Äù rule (eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily) is widely known, it‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all solution. The amount of water you need varies based on individual factors such as:

Today, Christmas morning, I saw my mom collapse in front of me. She was still conscious (kind of like being weak + leg not having strength to stand up). When I helped her, she said: ""this is why I am preparing things for you"". 

Later I noticed that this was not her first time (the collapsing. My mom told me about it today). I tried helping her out, but she got annoyed, and told me to leave her alone. 

From my room, I can hear my mom throwing up. 

During lunch, she didn't feel like eating so only drank fruit juice. Later, she did try to eat. However, she couldn't swallow after first bite. 

I did talked to my dad about this (he is a doctor). 

As of right now, I am not sure what to do. I got homework to do, but I can't seem to get the image of my mom collapsing out of my head. I got school tomorrow, but I am kind of scared that she will collapse when I am not there. 

She is better right now, watching videos on her phone and making coffee for herself. 

I want to ask her if she collapsed before, if so how many times & when. I want to ask why it happened, want to ask if she can be better if she rest properly. At the same time, I am afraid that it might stress her out.

  
Right now, my head is all jumbled up. I don't know what to do. I am not sure how to approach this. 

I am afraid to ask my mom because I don't want to stress her out.

I  have a small average looking house( I am very grateful for this). I don't aspire for a bigger house. No great talents or skills. I have just 4 close friends. I am shy and introverted. 

I have a steady and stable relationship, it's been 12 years and I am 100 percent committed to him for life. We don't aspire to have a wedding, get married, or have kids. We rescue stray animals. We have 23 rescue cats. We are content with our relationship andwe don't even live together but we are as happy as we can be. We go out on simple dates, nothing fancy, just movie nights or dinner dates at average restaurants.  We have a collaborative goal of opening a sanctuary for rescue animals. 

I take care of my ageing blind father ( I come from a broken home so this time with my father means everything to me.) I take it as an absolute honour to be able to care for him.

I have goals- Good health( Have always struggled with chronic diseases) ,fitness and  pursuing simple hobbies like reading, brewing coffee/tea, , or just hiking/ cycling. Nothing fancy. Even my hobbies and goals are average lol. ( I am working actively on these areas of my life- Health, fitness, diet, water intake, mental health), which I had let go for a very long time. 

I don't drink, I dont smoke. I dont vape. No subtances at all.

All around me, I see my friends/cousins/family pursuing bigger things like a bigger house, a bigger shiny car, a grand wedding, planning for kids, the next big jump in their corporate career, planning luxury vacations, eating amazing food at amazing restaurants ,buying precious jewels, latest gadgets or luxury stuff.  No judgements at all, I feel happy when people are happy and doing their thing. 

I somehow, honestly, have no interest in any of these things. Every area of my life seems just average. 

I don't know if this is contentment/satisfaction, or am I just being complacent in my life. I feel quite normal when I am just going about living my life, but when I look at the world doing stuff  I kind of feel - may be something is wrong with me? May be I am the outcast, or the loser who is not wanting the things the society and its "" Normal people "" want? Am I the just stuck in my comfort zone and should I step out to achieve more?

Merry Christmas everyone. IWNDWYT

Going straight in:

I work in the UK. So here a Band 7 (Ward Sister), Band 6 (Deputy Sister) and Band 5 (Staff Nurse). Plus Nursing Auxillaries (Band 3). The higher banding = higher pay. 

So I'm the Nurse in Charge (I'm a B6) on 24th night. I finished this morning. I'm working 23rd, 24th and 25th night. Part of the night NIC responsibilities on my ward is allocating the day team to their assignments in the day. For example, Sophie is in Bay 1. Marie is in Bay 2. Etc.

One of three B7s is working today. She arrives 10 minutes late. I allocate her to a bay. She has a bad reputation for never being on the floor and avoiding clinical responsibilities. She does co-ordinate but hardly ever takes a bay of patients. 

She says to me - in front of everyone -
""Why am I in a bay?"" 
""Because it is fair""
 She then says (again- in front of everyone)
""Oh well Matron [[Matrons are Band 8]] said I could go at 1730 today"" Our shifts are 0700-1930 and 1900-0730. 
""Why?""
""Because I'm working today and tomorrow""
Which I replied ""but that's not fair!!"" 

I admit I said this last part loudly and people were looking, but it's true! I am appalled that she should be allowed to leave early apparently because she is working Christmas and Boxing Day when half the people working today worked yesterday, the other half are working tomorrow. 

Apparently she then stormed off and was upset saying she felt that myself and another B6 colleague were bullying her.

A different colleague suggested I apologise to her before going home but I didn't because I am very angry and didn't want to say something I later regret.

I feel that she was the one who started that conversation publicly. She was the one who admitted special treatment. She is the one refusing to do the work she expects others to do. Also: on our rota she is down to work a full day, finishing at 1930. 

This just feels so unfair to me! I am equally outraged but also feel quite anxious which is made worse by the coffee/no sleep. 

I'd appreciate feedback/advice/opinions.

1hlx06x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hlx06x/what_does_a_hydrogen_water_bottle_do/,What Does a Hydrogen Water Bottle Do?,"Hydrogen water bottles have become a buzzword in the wellness world, but what do they actually do? That was my question when I first came across the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**. It sounded intriguing‚Äîinfusing water with molecular hydrogen to make it healthier? I decided to give it a try, and here‚Äôs what I learned about what a hydrogen water bottle really does and whether it‚Äôs worth the hype.

# What Does a Hydrogen Water Bottle Actually Do?

A **hydrogen water bottle**, like the **lifewater hydrogen bottle**, takes regular water and infuses it with molecular hydrogen gas. This process enhances the water with properties that go beyond basic hydration. The idea is that hydrogen-rich water can:

* **Provide antioxidants**: Hydrogen gas neutralizes harmful free radicals in the body.
* **Improve hydration**: The smaller hydrogen molecules penetrate cells more efficiently.
* **Reduce inflammation**: This can help alleviate issues like joint pain and muscle soreness.
* **Boost energy levels**: By supporting cellular function, it provides natural energy without stimulants.
* **Enhance recovery**: It‚Äôs popular among athletes for its potential to speed up muscle recovery.

At first, this sounded too good to be true, but after a few weeks of use, I started to understand why people rave about it.

# How Does It Work?

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** uses advanced **Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE)** and **Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)** technology to infuse water with hydrogen gas. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Fill the Bottle**: Add your regular water‚Äîfiltered, tap, or bottled.
2. **Press the Button**: The bottle starts its hydrogen infusion process.
3. **Electrolysis Happens**: Water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen.
   * The oxygen and other gases are vented out.
   * The hydrogen is infused into the water, creating tiny nano-bubbles.
4. **Ready to Drink in 3 Minutes**: You now have hydrogen-rich water that looks and tastes just like regular water but with added benefits.

# What Are the Benefits of Hydrogen Water?

The benefits of hydrogen water are subtle but noticeable. Here‚Äôs what it claims to do, and my experience with each:

1. **Better Hydration**: I felt more hydrated throughout the day, even with fewer refills. It seems to hydrate at a deeper level.

3. **Clearer Skin**: After a week, my skin started looking more hydrated and less dull.
4. **Reduced Inflammation**: I have mild joint discomfort, and while it didn‚Äôt disappear, it felt less stiff after consistent use.

# What Stands Out About the LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle?

Here‚Äôs why the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** works for me:

* **Ease of Use**: Fill, press a button, and wait three minutes‚Äîno complicated setup.
* **Portability**: Lightweight and leakproof, perfect for traveling or taking to work.
* **No Maintenance**: Unlike some other hydration gadgets, there are no filters or parts to replace.
* **Durability**: Made with high-quality materials that feel solid and last.

No product is perfect, and here are some things to consider:

* **Charging**: You‚Äôll need to recharge the base every few days, which might not suit everyone.

# Testing Procedure and Routine

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

1. Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?
2. Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.
3. Wear headphones - Yes, those fancy ones you only use for special occasions. It turns out soundwave entrainment needs crisp, clear sound to work its magic on your brain.
4. Close those peepers - Shutting your eyes helps shut out the world. With just you and The Genius Wave, it's less about seeing and more about feeling.
5. Focus on breathing - Deep breaths in and out set the stage for relaxation and open-mindedness toward the sounds you‚Äôre about to hear.
6. Hit play ‚Äì This is where you dive into The Genius Wave‚Äôs world: seven minutes of sound designed to kickstart your brain into a state of heightened awareness and creativity.
7. Reflection time ‚Äì After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!
8. Rinse and repeat ‚Äì Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.
9. Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.
10. Pairing with physical exercise ‚Äì Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.
11. Sharing experiences ‚Äì Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.
12. Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes‚Ä¶ whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure‚Äîa quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves‚Ä¶ sound waves that is!

8. Rinse and repeat ‚Äì Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.
9. Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.
10. Pairing with physical exercise ‚Äì Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.
11. Sharing experiences ‚Äì Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.
12. Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes‚Ä¶ whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

First time posting and heartbroken. 

We've (F37, M37) been having a lot of communication issues and fighting pretty badly each month. I'm a sensitive person due to past traumas that I'm actively working on (therapy and medication) and need to be treated with a bit more care than usual. I also noticed a pattern of building up events that are special to me but then crushing me by treating me unkind (being condescending and talking down to me) and doubling down when I express I don't like they way I'm being treated (birthdays, holiday, promotion).  This usually leads to being treated in such a way all day so I just pull away. 

After 1 1/2 years he still claims he doesn't know what I mean when I say he is treating me badly, even if i say he's being condescending or talking down to me.  Sadly, even my sister noticed it before I even mentioned anything to her; she told me he seems to enjoy it when I make mistakes or ""mess up"" even if I'm not technically wrong. I addressed it with him and added I didn't feel like he liked or respected me. He always dismissed my feelings and reassured me, saying he loved me but things hardly changed. I do feel loved but its so confusing cause I'm so unhappy when things are bad.

Today we were supposed to go see the Nutcracker, something I'd always dream of doing, it was my Christmas present from him. However, a couple of hours before we were supposed to leave he started treating me poorly again. I asked to be treated better and the doubling down happened again so I just told him if that was going to be the rest of my day, I would not be going to the ballet or spending the rest of the week off with him. I said if he did this to me again today there would not be future events together for this to happen again and I'd end our relationship. He kept being super defensive and pivoting and told me they would get ready for the show.  I said I would not go and was exhausted of having the same fights all the time. I explained I did not see the logic in doubling down since I don't stick around people that mistreat me, I simply walk away. In the end I just need peace and to focus on my health; fighting all the time has wrecked havoc on me and my body and brain are now almost creating an aversion. I'm at an airbnb and will spend Christmas alone so feeling really down about myself. I just wish I could be less sensitive or that it didn't hurt as much but can't really control that I guess and he can't adjust to my sensitivity so I'm just heartbroken. Any advice or positive feedback is much appreciated. 

Edit:  It can go from me telling him ""I love you"" and him literally replying ""Fuck you"" (only happened once, he said he thought i would get the joke cause its such an impossibility), to calling me a dipshit (I playfully called him a goof and that was his response, also only once) to him just kinda overriding what im saying if he disagrees (i said I wanted to go inside a shop to ask about nearby coffe shops and he kept repeating he didn't think it would help and drove off. I had to tell him to stop and let me out and the shop I wanted to visit actually sold coffee), asked not to smoke weed in my apartment after a smell complaint and he still did it which led to an inspection that I thankfully passed after cleaning up the place. I asked to please slow down when driving, just chill (he's an aggressive driver) and again it was dismissed (threatened to break up for him to drive safely with me in the car). On the other hand, he's really attentive and loving, he wants to spend time together and we are very compatible overall. He will change some things, like the driving for ex but no luck with being nicer to me.",1,1735115340.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False
1hlwuw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hlwuw7/one_year_anniversary_of_quitting_coffee_heres/,One year anniversary of quitting coffee. Here‚Äôs what the journey has been so far.,"- Before quitting, I slowly tapered it over four months. Mentally, it was the time I needed to say goodbye to a beloved companion I‚Äôve had daily for over two decades. I went from 5 cups a day to 4, then 3 and 2, then the last two weeks, I‚Äôd have only 1 cup, and for the last two days, I replaced coffee with green matcha. 

- Then, the big day arrived. I planned it to coincide with my holidays so I could feel rubbish without the need to function at work. And I‚Äôm so glad that I did it.

- For the first 48 hours, I was bedridden. I had terrible headaches and a terrible brain fog. It felt like my body was shutting down, and all I wanted to do was sleep. I had no energy for anything. I‚Äôd have paracetamol and get back to bed.

- By day three, my energy levels began to get back slowly. The headache had subsided, but I still had terrible brain fog.

- For the first 11 days, I had the occasional headache, felt fatigued and had a brain fog.

- By day 15, I began to experience terrible insomnia. I could not sleep at all. I would spend all night wide awake. I was exhausted and desperate to sleep, yet my body would simply not sleep. That persisted for the first six weeks, and during that period, I also experienced terrible anhedonia. I felt completely numb, dead inside, and that feeling was awful. I could have my favourite food, watch my favourite TV show, or even spend time with my favourite people; nothing would make me feel anything. My brain‚Äôs ability to produce dopamine was nil, my dopamine deposits were completely depleted, and I felt no joy. I was desperate to just feel anything. During that period, my desire to drink coffee was strong, not because I missed coffee but because I really wanted to experience joy again.

- For the first six weeks, I replaced coffee in the morning with a cup of tea (caffeine-free tea like rooibos and dandelion. I didn‚Äôt miss coffee, but I missed the ritual of drinking a warm beverage upon waking up and having tea as a replacement during that period, which helped me come to terms with and accept that things had changed.

- It was probably caused by the intense insomnia, but for the first six weeks, the terrible fatigue and brain fog persisted. 

- From the 3 month mark, it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I felt like I was slowly going back to being who I was. It wasn‚Äôt fast. It wasn‚Äôt overnight, but slowly noticing small wins week by week. I was a little bit less tired and experienced a little bit more joy in general. It was a glimpse of who I used to be. I was sleeping better, and I didn‚Äôt miss coffee at all. The brain fog persisted. 

- I learned that my energy is very dependent on how well I sleep; if I had a bad night's sleep or went to bed late, I had no energy the next day, and the brain fog was intense. If I had a good night's sleep, I would wake up feeling refreshed, and I wouldn‚Äôt experience brain fog. I would have consistent energy until about 3 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon and then I would get really tired. Fast forward to now, 12 months since quitting and not a lot has changed from the 3-month mark: I feel joy again. I can sleep. I don‚Äôt crave coffee at all. I still have a little bit of brain fog every now and then when I have a bad night's sleep. 

- I would say it has been worth it. Quitting coffee has been so incredibly difficult. I quit sugar in the past, and I would say coffee was a lot harder. One thing that I noticed since quitting coffee is that my anxiety levels are a lot lower. It hasn‚Äôt disappeared, but it is a lot milder now, and it is not all the time like it used to be. I used to have panic attacks quite regularly, and they are gone. 

- Negative effects of quitting caffeine: caffeine was a natural appetite suppressant for me. I could have a cup of coffee in the morning, and I‚Äôd not be hungry until lunch. Since quitting coffee, I find it harder to control my hunger. My guts also have changed. I found that coffee made me regular, and without it, that‚Äôs no longer the case.

- Despite everything, it was worth it. I feel free not to be dependent on a substance anymore, and that was my number one reason for quitting. Would I ever go back to coffee? No. Quitting coffee was an extraordinary journey. It was painful. It put a huge strain on my mind and on my body; it tested my limits, my strength and my willpower. It was unpleasant and torturous at times. I wouldn‚Äôt want to go back to coffee simply because I know if I decide to quit again, I would have to go through that journey again, and there‚Äôs no way I want to experience any of it ever again.

Every journey is different; that‚Äôs just mine. I wish you good luck with your journey. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.",16,1735115216.0,decaf,3,0.94,False

It's a YA fiction, romance, that has themes of overcoming trauma.","I read this book before 2018, but I'm not sure when or how long before that I read it. Anyways, it's about this female main character who is going to college and works at a coffee shop shop. She is training to run a marathon (I think) and at the beginning of the book, there is a flashback, and she is standing on a dock or near the beach, as a kid, looking at a house that she either hears screaming or a fire or something is happening at that house. Now, back in the present, she meets the siblings of the family that lived in that house and they go to the same college as her. One brother is a love interest, and they all have PTSD from their childhood, but the other brother has a hard time keeping it under control and breaks down a lot I think. SPOILER (I think their mom was pushed down the stairs and died?) I also think they have a sister. 

Anyway, if you can help me find this book, it would make me so happy!",2,1735114335.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False
