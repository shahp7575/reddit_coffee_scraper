( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1q8swey,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1q8swey/looking_for_feedback_on_a_short_story_who_what/,"Looking for Feedback on a Short Story: Who, What, When, Wear, Why? (3,200 words)","Their clothes. That’s what I remember most about the day we met. The chestnut horses they rode were certainly handsome creatures, but the men’s uniforms really struck me. Each wore an identical navy overcoat affixed with polished gold buttons that glimmered in the sunlight. Large brass belt buckles held up trousers blue as the sky, emblazoned with a yellow side-stripe. A Stetson hat, leather gauntlets and shin-high boots completed the outfit, offering stark contrast to our predominantly beige attire.

One of the men dismounted his horse and presented our elders with an assortment of beautiful glass beads. The gift signaled that they came in peace, yet I took notice of a long rifle protruding from the saddlebag and a pistol at the man’s hip. The language he spoke was unfamiliar, but my uncle who had traveled far and wide understood and offered to translate.

He explained that the horsemen were building a trading post a few miles downriver and wanted to acquaint themselves with the locals, as we had much needed meat and pelts which could be swapped for their manufactured goods.

The rest I failed to hear, for youthful curiosity overwhelmed me. Emerging from my hiding spot behind my mother’s legs, I approached the man and tugged on his colorful pants. He looked down and smiled, his light eyes friendly and warm. Bending to my level, he reached into his pocket and produced a single silver coin which he offered in the palm of his hand.

“Dollar,” he said.

I took the coin and examined it. One side featured the profile of a stoic looking woman with wavy hair. The other displayed a majestic open-winged eagle.

“Dollar,” I repeated, grinning at my newfound treasure.

The man patted me on the head and shook hands with the elders before mounting his horse. He turned to ride away but swung back around to face me and pointed to his chest.

“George,” he said.

I understood enough to know he was telling me his name.

“Chaska,” I replied.

George nodded in acknowledgement, and together with his horseman rode off into the distance.

A friendship blossomed over the next few months as goods flowed back and forth between our camps. The other boys and I raced to meet the dust cloud that accompanied their weekly visit, eager to see what new curiosities George and his men had come to deliver.

Spring and summer soon faded into fall and their appearances became less frequent. One morning I awoke to a thin layer of white powder dusting the surrounding plains. A premature snowstorm the night before signaled a harsh winter ahead, and urgent preparations were needed to survive the coming cold.

Later that afternoon, preoccupied with chores, I failed to notice a horse approach until spooked by a whinny in my ear. I whirled around to see George chuckling at my reaction. He hopped down from the steed and I playfully tossed a handful of snow, spattering the breast of his overcoat with ice.

George feigned retaliation and I dashed away giggling as the elders came to greet him. Now a safe distance from reprisal, I turned to watch the men speak. George unbuckled a knapsack from his horse and removed a woven scarf. Its color was a perfect match of his trousers, down to the dazzling yellow stripe bisecting the wool. He offered the cloth to my uncle who bowed in reverence at his generosity.

George then stuck his thumb and forefinger into his mouth and emitted a loud whistle. His men led a train of pack mules up to the front and proceeded to unload their baggage, setting down scarf after scarf until a veritable mountain lay at their feet. Our chief approached George to offer an ornately carved pipe, but George shook his head and held up his hand in refusal. The scarves were a gift.

Snowflakes began to sprinkle and George packed to leave. I wanted to say goodbye, but Mother called my name and I knew disobeying would have consequences for my backside. I waved farewell and marched away.

The early storm had indeed been a harbinger of worse to come. A severe blizzard struck later that week, forcing us to seek shelter from the barrage of snow. For three days we huddled in our tents while the wind outside howled like a wounded coyote. Deer and buffalo hides kept our bodies warm, but the soft woolen scarves added insulation around our collars. They were especially useful when wrapped over our mouths and noses, sparing our lungs from the sting of the frigid air.

We emerged to find the landscape buried beneath two feet of powder. The bitter frost had destroyed the crops in the fields, leaving our food supply dangerously short for the coming months.

Out of necessity I found myself thrust into duty as a fisherman. Each day, the other boys and I trekked to the river and cut holes in the ice, using wooden lures and rods to catch trout. Paired with the limited game the men managed to catch, the fish helped keep our bellies full. One crisis had been averted but another soon surfaced.

Later that November I was roused from sleep by my baby sister’s cough. She had been somewhat ill for a few days, but her intense hacks indicated a deteriorating condition. At Mother’s behest I dashed to the medicine man and urged him to come right away. For hours he tended to my sister, chanting and rubbing a red concoction on her forehead, but as the sun rose, one final spasm shook her body and she ceased breathing.   

Word of the tragedy spread swiftly and a steady stream of villagers flowed to our tent to offer condolences. The last to come was the Chief, who carried the infant body away and gently laid it atop a funeral scaffold. There, with her favorite corn husk doll clutched in her tiny hand, my sister would ascend to the afterlife.

Mother caught fever soon after. Even in the dead of winter sweat soaked through her clothes. She grew gaunter by the hour, withering before us like a rose in the desert. When she finally passed, her sunken eyes and hollow cheeks rendered her almost unrecognizable.

I’d have thought she died from melancholy had others not started exhibiting the same symptoms. Illness spread through the camp like wildfire. The old, young, and weak were first to succumb, but nobody was safe from the disease’s invisible talons. Bodies accumulated faster than we could erect scaffolds. The stench of death permeated the air, but still I continued my duty as a fisherman bringing food to the survivors.  

Day after day our numbers dwindled in the face of the pestilence until my uncle was the last remaining mouth to feed. In my naivety, I believed he would recover – up until the moment his wheezing stopped and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. I was now the sole survivor.

I ran to my bedding and buried my face in the rolled-up pelt I used for a pillow. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I lay frightened and alone, unsure of what to do next, when suddenly my fingers brushed across the dollar George had given me.

Of course! If I could find his camp George would surely help. I knew the direction from which he always arrived, but the distance remained a mystery. A long journey’s worth of food and water would need to be prepared.

I wiped my eyes and set off to the river to collect provisions, spending the next four days catching and smoking trout. As the sun set on the final day, I filled a knapsack as heavy as my slight frame could hold before laying down to sleep.  

At dawn, I slung the pack over my shoulder and headed south, gripping the silver dollar tightly in my hand for good luck. For hours I trudged through the snow until I felt I might collapse from exhaustion. I dropped the sack to the ground and plunked down to rest my weary feet. Sleep overwhelmed me, for my next recollection was being jolted awake by a hand on my arm. I sprung to my feet ready to fight the possible danger, but it was George who knelt before me.

I wrapped my arms around his neck and began to bawl, trying to explain through sniffles the atrocity I had witnessed. George nodded in somber understanding. He hoisted me into the saddle of his horse, climbed behind me and took the reins. With a click of his tongue, the animal did a pirouette and ambled past the other men, who, in turn, took off galloping north in the direction from where I’d come.

George and I rode in silence until reaching the palisade walls of a fort. Two armed men patrolling the ramparts greeted us with a friendly wave and opened the gates.

“Home,” George said as we approached a small wooden cabin and dismounted. Inside a steady fire burned in a stone hearth. George directed me to a cot in the corner and removed a kettle from the flames, pouring a steaming cup of coffee which I gladly accepted. He settled into his own cot as I sipped the hot liquid. Slowly, my frozen bones began to thaw and the comforting warmth of safety enveloped my body. Once again, my eyes grew heavy with the throes of sleep.

“George?” I murmured, laying my head on the pillow.

He turned to face me.  

“Thank you.”

No words came, but his lips pursed into a solemn smile before he tipped his hat down over his eyes to rest.

The next few months proved difficult as not everyone at the fort welcomed me with open arms. I noticed the glares George and I received, and how mothers quietly ushered their offspring to the other side of the street when they saw us approaching. George always made me feel safe though, shielding me from harassment as best he could. 

One afternoon I returned from school to find George in full-dress. “Where?” I asked, presuming he was to leave on assignment.

“Just right outside,” he replied, bending to my level. “But listen to me, Chaska. You must stay inside until I return. Stay away from the windows and do not open this door for anyone. Do you understand?”

His tone rang with a stern urgency I’d never heard. Taken aback, I retreated to my bed. George placed his finger to his lips and slipped out the door.

For quite some time I remained still, but my inquisitive nature soon prevailed. I poked my head above the windowsill to see an audience gathered around a man in a fine suit speaking opposite George. The man presented George an item and the two men saluted before shaking hands. Not wanting to expose myself any longer, I ducked back down as the crowd’s applause filled the air.

A few minutes later George entered, removed his hat, and set a tiny wooden box down on the writing table.

I pointed at the object, curious as to what lay inside.

He sighed and motioned me over to have a look. Inside the box sat a silver coin comparable to mine, only larger.

I smiled at George with genuine happiness, for the item seemed quite valuable, but he neglected to share the same veneration. He tousled my hair and casually flipped the box into the clothing trunk at the foot of his bed.

As time went on, I acclimated to my new home. I made friends with the other children and learned to read and write. George raised me like his own and I grew to view him as a father. At eighteen, I joined the regiment, proud to follow in his footsteps and wear the fine uniform.

Not long after, George fell ill. The doctor prescribed rest and laudanum, but George continued the medicine even after the moratorium. His lively spirit faded with each sip of the bottle. I pleaded with him to stop – but the clutches of addiction were no match for reason.      

Before long he assumed a regular position in bed smiling at the ceiling in quiet euphoria. When he did speak it was about his days with the regiment, retelling tales of his moments of glory. I had heard the stories countless times, but still I humored George and listened with rapt attention each time they were retold.

One winter afternoon I entered the cabin to find George, in uniform, reclining on his bed. The remaining contents of his clothing trunk were strewn about the room.

“Reminiscing again?” I said, shaking the snow from my boots and placing them near the door.

“Yes,” he replied, blissfully unaware of the mess.

“I’m not upset, but we’ve talked about this,” I chided, beginning to pick his things off the floor. “Your uniform is always hanging in the closet, not in your trunk.”

George ignored me as I folded socks and shirts. Out of the corner of my eye I caught glimpse of an object halfway underneath the bed. I bent down on my hands and knees and stretched to reel in a small, half-open box. Inside sat George’s medal which I had long since forgotten.

“Wow, look at this,” I said, handing him the open container.

He stared vacantly for a moment before my words registered. “Have I ever told you the story of how I got that?” he asked.

“As a matter of fact… no.” I pulled a chair next to him, excited to hear a new tale. “I’d like to hear it though.”

George took the medal into his hand and set the wooden case on the bed. “This was given to me for an act of service to my country,” he began, his words soft and sluggish. “When we first arrived on this land, a tribe of natives lived a few miles away. We didn’t know if they posed a threat so I ordered a reconnaissance mission to make contact. We brought with us a peace offering of beads and established a friendly relationship which I reported to my superiors back east.”

I smiled and recalled that first day we met. How taken I had been by the men’s uniforms, and now here I was wearing the same regalia.

However,” George continued, “they wanted us to attack and eliminate the natives. Starting an unprovoked war would be a needless waste, so instead I asked for extra scarves in the coming shipment of winter provisions. Just like this.” He tugged on the one wrapped around his neck. “It was going to be a cold winter and I knew the natives would wear them.”

I swelled with pride. That was the George I knew – kind and caring.

“I’ve never told anyone this part,” he said. “Not even my own boy.”

My nose tingled as I fought back tears. It broke my heart when he forgot my face.

“His name is Chaska. I’m sure you’ve seen him around.”

I nodded.

“I became fond of him at the native camp, but the plan all along was for him not to make it. Like the others.”

I furrowed my brow in confusion, but being that George carried on calmly, I assumed I misheard.

“By some miracle he survived and was making his way to our camp when I found him. I still remember the sight – how heartbreaking to see such a small boy so bravely looking for help. I took sympathy and brought him to live with me.”

“Yes, you saved his life,” I said.

“No” George replied,  his voice grim. “I’m the reason he was alone in the first place. They died because of me. It was my idea.”

I scoffed. “Ok, George, time for sleep.” This was certainly the laudanum talking, but such chatter upset me nonetheless.

“It was my idea,” he repeated. “Look in the case. There’s a letter.”

I reached over and eased the box open. Sure enough, tucked into the lid was a note.



*Dear Colonel George McKenzie,*

 

*I want to personally commend you for the eradication of the savages. Your idea to infect the scarves with influenza was a stroke of genius, for it allowed us to obtain our objectives without a single loss of American life. As such, it is my great honor to present you with this Medal of Honor for your service to your country.*

*Yours truly,*

 

*Daniel S. Lamont,*

*Secretary of War*



I looked up at George slowly, my mouth agape with horror. The man I considered a father had slaughtered my family and my people.

“Why?” I finally mustered.

“I…I was just following orders. It was my job.” George turned his gaze to the floor. “I’m ashamed of my actions, but I’ve done my best to repent by raising him.”

I gagged, nauseous at George’s very presence. I stood to flee but he grabbed my arm.

“Tell me kind stranger – do you think I’m evil?” His voice cracked and sorrow filled his eyes, but his touch burned my skin like a hot iron. 

In a flash of rage, I seized the wooden box and bashed it into George’s skull. He wailed and tried to wriggle free, but I pinned his feeble body to the mattress. Again and again I bludgeoned him, undeterred by the warm blood misting across my face. Only when his screams fell silent did my rampage stop. I looked down at George’s mangled face and slumped against the wall.

A soldier, drawn by the commotion, burst through the door upon the grisly scene.

“Halt right there!” he shouted, whipping his gun from its holster.

The command, however, was unnecessary for already I sat frozen, gazing vacantly at George’s uniform, once so revered, now stained an ugly crimson.

 

\*\*\*

I was arrested without altercation, as I do not deny killing George McKenzie. What I do object to is the notion that my actions were criminal. I consider them neither vengeance nor retribution, but rather justice. Who were George and his minions to label us uncivilized? How twisted to rationalize genocide beneath the banner of progress!

But now I must conclude with haste, for I am sentenced to die at daybreak and the sun’s golden head already peeks over the horizon. At any moment the padding of footsteps will approach and I shall be escorted to the gallows. It is there I am doomed to meet my end, afforded the last words upon which I have already decided. As the hangman tightens the noose around my neck, I shall pull the dollar from my pocket and hold it up for the bloodthirsty crowd.

“I agree with you on one point,” I intend to say as I hurl the coin into the throng. No doubt they will tussle and spar for the small piece of shiny metal. “Barbarians have no place amongst men.”

Then the floor will collapse from under me and the mob will cheer the crack of my neck, gleefully watching until my body stops twisting and the rope is still.   ",1,1768014461.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

""You know what's actually attractive? A guy who approaches because he has something genuine to say, not because I'm just another girl he's trying to impress.""

It was my seventeenth cold approach of the week. I had been reading all the pickup material, watching confidence videos, and forcing myself to talk to women in coffee shops, bookstores, and on the street. I thought I was working on self-improvement. In reality, I was treating connections like conquests and women like checkboxes.

This particular approach was at a bookstore. She was browsing the psychology section I wasn't. But I walked up with my rehearsed opener about book recommendations anyway. Her response stopped me cold.

She wasn't cruel about it. She was matter-of-fact, looking directly at me with a slight smile that held no animosity but offered no encouragement either. There was something in her calm delivery that cut through all my prepared lines and techniques.

""I can tell you're nervous,"" she continued when I said nothing. ""And that's actually fine. Nervousness is honest. But the rehearsed confidence isn't working for either of us.""

I should have been mortified. Instead, I felt strangely relieved like someone had finally called out the elephant in the room. My whole approach to meeting women had been built on a fundamental misunderstanding of both confidence and connection.

""Can I ask you something?"" I said, abandoning my script entirely. ""What would have been a better way to start a conversation with you?""

What followed was a twenty-minute talk that changed my entire perspective. She explained that she could always tell the difference between someone approaching with genuine interest versus someone approaching because she fit certain criteria. The former felt like a compliment the latter felt like being reduced to an opportunity.

""If you had noticed what book I was looking at and had an actual thought about it, that would have been real,"" she said. ""Or if you had just admitted you wanted to meet me because something specific caught your attention. Authenticity is magnetic. The techniques you're using are transparent.""

She wasn't telling me not to approach women she was highlighting the difference between connection and collection. Between seeing someone as a person versus seeing them as a challenge.

The next day, I threw out the pickup material and made a new commitment: I would only approach when I had something genuine to say or ask, not just because someone was attractive. I would allow myself to be nervous rather than hiding behind false bravado. And I would measure success by the quality of interactions, not by getting phone numbers.

The results were immediate and profound. I had fewer interactions, but infinitely better ones. I remember approaching a woman at a farmers market because I was genuinely curious about the unusual fruit she was buying. No agenda, just curiosity. We ended up walking around the market together for an hour, and yes, exchanged numbers naturally at the end.

Another time, I complimented a woman on her band t-shirt because I actually loved that band. The conversation flowed into music, then concerts, then our shared experience growing up in the Midwest. There was no technique in sight just authentic connection.

The most important shifthowever, wasn't in how women responded to me. It was in how I felt about myself. The constant anxiety about ""performing"" correctly had been exhausting. Being genuine, even when nervous, felt freeing. I no longer walked away from interactions feeling like I had succeeded or failed I walked away havinsimply experienced a human connection, whatever form it took.

That bookstore woman probably doesn't remember our conversation. She likely has no idea that her straightforward feedback fundamentally changed my approach to not just dating, but all social interactions. But her willingness to be honest rather than just dismissive gave me the wake-up call I needed.

The great irony of cold approaching is that the moment you stop seeing it as a technique to master and start seeing it as humans connecting with humans, that's when the real magic happens. Not in how many numbers you collect, but in how many moments of genuine connection you create even if they last just five minutes in a bookstore with someone you'll never see again.",1,1768014303.0,NextGenMan,0,1.0,False

It didn't work out that way. Between the time I received the offer and the time I started, the new unit I was hired to join had completely shifted course and it was no longer the fit it was supposed to be. Still, I made it 3 years there and even launched an entirely new service line despite higher-ups throwing roadblocks in my path because the partner I worked for was feuding with other partners. At roughly the 2.5 year mark, the partner I worked for abruptly left the company and within 6 months, I was laid off. 

It's been nearly 16 months of hell. Hundreds upon hundreds of applications. Dozens of coffees with people in my network. God only knows how many emails to more distant contacts. And it's all yielded about 5 interviews.

My resume is impressive. The accomplishments on there are those of an operator, a problem solver at some of the highest levels of both interjurisdictional government with lives on the line, and in corporate consulting. 

In 3 instances, I've been led on for months, meeting with person after person, team after team at a firm, only to be told that they appreciate my time and they're impressed with my background, but they just can't figure out how they would use me within their organization. 

I've been cobbling together little contract engagements here and there to bring in some money, but I've depleted my savings. My credit cards are all but maxed. I cashed out the 401k I had from the job that laid me off a few months ago and it's dwindling fast. I've cut out subscriptions and anything that isn't essential spending. I'm terrified of losing our house at this point. I'm working on getting the doomsday clock dialed-in, but I'm thinking I have 3-5 months to figure something out before I miss a mortgage payment. 

Today, the job I felt like I had the best chance of landing yet informed me that budget constraints and revenue projections had shifted downward and they're no longer going to be filling the position. 

Tomorrow, I'll wake up, go for a run, and assess whether it's time to start looking at ditch digging jobs and put the house up for sale preemptively. This is hardly the market for it, but it's a nice house and you never know. 

But tonight, I'm just sending this into the void as my wife sits on the other side of the sofa, enjoying her show, and the kids play UNO on the floor. I never imagined being in this position and I have no idea what else I need to do or what I'm doing wrong. ",2,1768014180.0,Employment,0,1.0,False

First time posting here but been reading a while. I could do with some advice and guidance. I picked up a Mazzer Philos (I189D burrs, I like mostly traditional espresso, medium to med dark) about a week ago, an upgrade from a Sette 270. Great unit and feels like a big step up (mostly motivated by the noise from the Sette).

I have had some issues with shot consistency. Every day, I seem to have to grind a notch finer.

I tend to pull 3-4 shots a day. I’ll dial in an average 18gr in, 36gr out 30sec shot – but the next day that shot pulls in 25 seconds. So I go a notch finer again, get a 30 sec shot or maybe two that morning. but then maybe the second shot right after chokes up and runs long (45 seconds+).

I did the factory suggested calibration/zero per Mazzer (bottom it out, dial to 10 and reset zero point) when it first arrived.

Beans roasted approx. 2 weeks prior - Medium roast blend

Context on setup and workflow:

Machine is a Rancilio Silvia with the typical PID controller mod, upgraded shower screen and gaskets, low-profile nut. Using 18gr IMS baskets (not the nanocoated type). None of this changed when I moved to the Philos, just providing context.

Checked OPV pressure using the water flow test and confirmed set at \~9bar.

Using the PID enabled pre-infusion (2 seconds wet, 3 seconds rest, then shot starts)

I understand the burrs come 'pre seasoned' on the Philos. I've put approximately 24oz/680gr of beans through it since arrival. Maybe a little more.

To detail my workflow:

1. Decant 18gr beans into dosing tray (from normcore coffee cellars, I pre-weigh ahead of time as time limited with family duty in AM)
2. RDT – two sprays and a light stir of the beans
3. Into hopper
4. Grinder on
5. Slowly open trapdoor to feed beans steadily into auger/grinder
6. Invert Philos stock dosing cup into portafilter
7. Funnel on portafilter 
8. WDT - few laps right at the bottom of the basket with tight circles, working upward
9. Tap or two on the counter to settle grounds below the top level of the basket
10. Tamp - normcore leveling sprung tamper
11. Portafilter into the machine

Given that the grinder is the new variable here, **natural first question**: Is this a symptom of a new grinder ‘seasoning’ or bedding/wearing in? Seasoning seems to be a polarizing topic and would love some opinions here.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q8smse,https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/english/11928072,Korean defense stocks rally on Trump’s call for higher military spending - 매일경제 영문뉴스 펄스(Pulse),"South Korean defense stocks extended their rally on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a sharp increase in U.S. military spending.

Shares of Hanwha Aerospace Co. were trading at 1.17 million won ($804.6) as of 9:17 a.m., up 7.16 percent from the previous session and marking a new 52-week high.

The stock followed a 7.92 percent jump the previous day, when it closed at 1.09 million won.

Other defense names also moved higher.

LIG Nex1 Co. rose 2.45 percent, Hyundai Rotem Co. gained 3.32 percent, and Poongsan Corp. advanced 5.26 percent.

Investor sentiment toward defense stocks improved amid heightened geopolitical tensions and Trump’s comments calling for a larger military budget.

In a post on his social media account on Thursday, Trump said the U.S. defense budget for 2027 “should not be $1trillion” but “rather $1.5 trillion,” citing national interests during what he described as “troubled and dangerous times.”

Trump has recently increased pressure in the Caribbean by deploying substantial U.S. military forces ahead of an operation targeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and those forces remain in place.

He has also openly expressed interest in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and has suggested the use of U.S. forces as one possible option. Trump has further hinted at the possibility of military action against Colombia, which, like Venezuela, is governed by a left-wing administration.

Meanwhile, Korean chipmakers moved lower in early trading, tracking weakness in U.S. semiconductor stocks.

Samsung Electronics Co. shares were trading at 136,500 won as of 9:07 a.m., down 1.66 percent from the previous session after opening at 136,000 won.

SK hynix Inc. was down 1.59 percent at 744,000 won.

Overnight in New York, most major semiconductor stocks fell on profit-taking, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 1.83 percent for a second straight session.

Shares of Hanwha Aerospace finished at 1,214,000 won on Friday, up 11.38 percent from the previous session while LIG Nex1 Co. ended at 542,000 won, Hyundai Rotem at 219,000 won, and Poongsan at 120,900 won. Samsung Electronics closed at 139,000 won and SK hynix at 744,000 won.

It's frustrating how normal activities like hanging out with friends are seen as wrong and something to be ashamed of in JW culture. Especially if the friend is the opposite gender. 

Since I've woken up I've allowed myself to actually reach out to people and hang out with friends I've made after class. Of course I just don't tell my parents what I'm doing but I heard that my dad is getting suspicious that I'm meeting with people when I leave the house.

And so what if I am meeting with people?? Why should I feel guilty for doing innocuous things like getting coffee, or running errands, or playing board games with someone? Why should I feel bad for having platonic male friendships? Why should I feel bad for wanting a social life? 

All those talk on ""good association"" are really an isolation technique. It's not even enough that someone is from the congregation, they have to be a ""good spiritual influence."" And is their spirituality based on how they treat people, their kindness, or their intentions? No. It's all about how much they do for the organization, how well they follow the rules, and how likely it is they'll ""counsel"" you if you step out of line. 

So many Witness kids grow up socially stunted because their social life is so strictly controlled and moralized. It can't be healthy to be constantly categorizing people and relationships as ""good and Godly and wholesome"" and ""bad and Satanic and unwholesome."" I regret all of the friendships with genuinely kind and supportive people that I've cut off in the name of pleasing ""Jehovah.""",3,1768013610.0,exjw,0,0.8,False

**Contact activist Sinéad Whelehan obtained a photo of an “ET” while participating in a CE-5 event. Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person’s world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sinéad Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the **“Beyond Being Human” website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the “Beyond Being Human” webpage Sinéad is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness “as well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.” 

I subscribe to Jeff Mara’s Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program “**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event – ALIEN PHOTO.”** 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small “alien” being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following: 

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small “boxy” non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared. 

**Sinéad ’s Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara’s interview, Sinéad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program. The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sinéad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night. **Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.** Sinéad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sinéad Whelehan:** This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn’t know, who was in the circle. Now you’re seeing the very edge of the meditation circle…. Grant Cameron…  was there with me…. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.….**And there’s a little being right there. And here’s the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well…** 

**A**nd then here’s a really super-duper close-up version of the little being…

**Jeff Mara:** Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sinéad Whelehan:** Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience… I was feeling them to my left … You can see where my body is… and here’s the little being’s shoulder and there’s the neck, it’s head… the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.   
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sinéad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sinéad Whelehan’s personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sinéad’s  journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants. 

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sinéad experienced what she describes as a “massive awakening.” She explained the term “awakening” might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to “being bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan…” It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant. 

Sinéad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sinéad, the beings were saying, “OK. It’s time! We’ve been with you all along. It’s now time. You have a job to do!”   And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with “the extraterrestrials.” This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside. 

For two decades Sinéad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?   
  
**In the following section of this report, Sinéad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.** In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sinéad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.) 

“It’s that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.  I knew what they were telling me was real.  And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.  

An example is that I’m a teacher.  This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my “awakening” in July and about two weeks after the “big cosmic frying pan experience” happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills). 

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,” Oh my God, I have gone crazy.” 

So, I started getting worried about myself.  I went home one day… and I was very upset.  I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I’m not someone who grew up religious… I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, “I need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable….”

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.  Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual… (What) we’re supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there’s this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them… We’re supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.  They are 10-11 years old. They’re in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about “the Day I Became Famous.” It’s a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o’clock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, “the earth is alive”, “the Galaxy is full of other beings” (What) I was reading … has nothing to do with the original prompt “The Day I Became Famous.” Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child’s writing, “there’s a portal in my bedroom”, “I designed time travel”, “I made a time machine”, “the earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we’re all doing to her”. “There are spaceships out there.” I mean I just couldn’t believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, “I have to”… I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to… “I need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?” Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.  

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.  They all wrote me back and said, “Yep this is what happens.” You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) “How I Became Famous” (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th) graders, things like) “because of YouTube.” 

**Discussion:**

**How were** the non-human intelligences that contacted Sinéad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th) graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing “The Day I Became Famous”, they wrote about numerous themes associated with “ET contact.”  

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/“illusory” mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These “thought forms” might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sinéad ’s recollection of this “High Strangeness” be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called “anomalous phenomena”, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sinéad and reassuring her with a reply akin to “Yep this is what happens.”

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science’s explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong. 

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our “reality” at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the “inexplicable” events that we label “High Strangeness.” Sinéad ’s encountering a stack of “anomalous” handwritten 6^(th) grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her “friends in high places.”

1q8sh21,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiboSuccessStories/comments/1q8sh21/sharing_what_helped_my_ibs_after_an_8year_journey/,Sharing What Helped My IBS After an 8-Year Journey,"A very long message, because I am trying to share as much as I can in hopes it will help someone.

**NOTE:** This is not medical advice. It’s purely my personal experience based on trial and error.

**Key message:** I realized food wasn’t the issue—my digestive system was dysregulated. More details below.

After 8 years of a difficult journey with IBS, I finally found something that is helping me. I am not cured, but I’ve regained some control over my body and can finally manage my symptoms.

Below, I’ll first outline my symptoms and then share my new routine. I recommend trying this routine consistently for at least two weeks before giving up. I began noticing improvements around day 10. I’ve been following it for the past four weeks, and my stomach feels better each day. I expect I’ll need to stay on this routine for some time, until my body can function well without it. For now, I’m supporting my body in ways that a healthy digestive system naturally operates.

Before starting this routine, please do your own research to ensure it’s compatible with your lifestyle, age, environment, and any medications you may be taking.

**My medical journey**

I was diagnosed with IBS eight years ago and switched doctors multiple times due to dismissive attitudes toward my pain (often referred to as mere “discomfort”). I’ve had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, allergy testing, countless blood panels, tried a low-FODMAP diet, acupuncture, and even took SSRIs for a few months for what was described as anxiety-driven IBS (which was a terrible mistake for me). Nothing ever came back “wrong,” yet I felt awful every day.

**My symptoms**

* Symptoms began as soon as digestion was activated, regardless of what I consumed—food or liquid
* Bloating started immediately when I began eating, not later during digestion
* Constant bloating throughout my entire torso, not just my stomach
* Bloating could be painful (pressure under the rib cage, gas cramps) or painless (appearing pregnant, with up to three inches of swelling everywhere)
* Bloating was severe, up to three inches. Pants that I wore before the meal would no longer fit after the meal
* Food felt like it constantly sat in my stomach
* I rarely felt hunger cues; I would go from not hungry to nearly fainting, which was my signal that I hadn’t eaten
* I felt full by the third bite, and my body urgently told me to stop eating
* Bowel movements felt incomplete, coming out in pieces (pellets) or shredded (like wet paper)
* I had no normal urge for bowel movements; I would sit on the toilet for 20–30 minutes waiting. Without sitting, waiting, and straining, it wouldn’t happen
* Shopping and travel were major triggers for painful, gas-related bloating

**What I changed (and why it helped)**

I implemented all of the following practices at once. I strongly believe this routine works best when done holistically, rather than piecing together individual changes.

**Morning**

* I drink warm water first thing in the morning; my digestion needs to wake up gently
* I drink warm water before meals if I already feel bloated (sometimes sipping during meals as well)
* Light movement to start the day (e.g., gentle walking around the apartment, walking the dog)
* 3-6 deep, slow, and intentional breathing (via stomach, not chest)

**Breathing & posture (the biggest shock for me)**

* I stopped crossing my legs while working, sitting, and eating, which reduced compression of my abdomen and pelvic floor. I hadn’t realized how often I did this. After a month, crossing my legs now causes immediate stomach discomfort.
* Instead of fidgeting in my chair, I get up and move. I used to ignore my body’s signals; now, when discomfort starts, I respond immediately. Even minimal movement can help.
* Softening my stomach: I realized I was unconsciously holding my stomach in all day (think of how we pull our stomach in for photos to make our stomach look flatter). It took time to relearn how to let it relax. Remember to not push your stomach out, just gently let go.
* Intentional belly/rib breathing: this relaxes the diaphragm and supports digestion and bowel reflexes. I aim for 3–6 slow breaths in the morning, before meals, or when stressed. I discovered I had been living on shallow breathing, and this practice made a big difference.

**Eating & meals**

* Warm breakfasts, which are easier on digestion than cold foods.
* Eating slowly (about one minute between bites) to allow the stomach and intestines to coordinate properly. This helped me recognize fullness and stop at the right point. It felt awkward at first, but became natural with time.
* Stopping before feeling “too full” to avoid pressure and nervous system overload.
* I eat three meals a day – incredibly important to train the digestion to kick in on time (google this term: cephalic phase of digestion)
* Movement after meals (this was huge): even 1-minute helps, ideally up to a 10-minute gentle walk. If walking isn’t possible, standing and gently swaying your hips for a minute works. This helps food move down instead of getting stuck and causing bloating. Keep movement light and intentional—not intense exercise. I personally got a walking pad for convenience, but you don’t need it. You can tidy the room, walk around the house, walk the dog, etc. Any light movement will do.
* during the first 4 weeks of this routine, i avoided big trigger foods (e.g., rice, potatoes). I started to introduce them slowly during my second week when I felt some stability in my stomach.

**Coffee**

* I stopped drinking coffee first thing in the morning. It triggers my stomach to get into a ""fight of flight"" mode. I start my day first with warm water, eat a warm breakfast, wait 15 mins, and then drink coffee. And I need to drink the coffee slow. I also reduced my coffee intake to one cup a day, because i realized that i was making the ""fullness"" feeling worse for me. Eventually i stopped coffee all together and I feel 100% times better. It was very difficult during the first two weeks (e.g., migraines, fatigue), but I was determined. Week three is when I started to not need it. If you want to try and stop coffee, do so during the weekend so you can adjust to it outside working hours.

**Teas & supplements**

* Ginger tea: supports stomach emptying and gas movement. Best time to drink ginger tea is when you are bloating from fullness without gas (think of it as soft bloating).
* Ginger capsules: an alternative to ginger tea, and especially useful before large meals; tea worked better for me. Do not combine both at the same time.
* Peppermint tea: relaxes intestinal spasms and reduces gas pain. Best time to drink it is when you have gas-trapped bloating (think of it as hard bloating).
* Peppermint capsules: an alternative to peppermint tea; again, do not combine both at the same time.
* I legit carry ginger and peppermint tea bags on my bag now because I never know when I will need it

**Movement**

* Daily walking, especially after meals
* Gentle yoga or stretching (avoid intense core workouts during the first few weeks of this routine, as your digestion needs softness to feel safe)

**Signs this routine was working for me**

* I no longer bloat immediately after eating. If bloating occurs, it happens later during digestion
* Bloating is mostly in my lower abdomen (digestion) rather than throughout my torso (inflammation)
* All bloating resolves overnight; I wake up with a flat stomach
* Normal bowel movement urges returned, and bowel movements became more formed, easier, and more complete
* I can now reduce bloating once it starts. Either through walking/movement, tea, or breathing, I am able to reduce the symptoms
* Gas moves instead of getting trapped
* Hunger cues returned; I am now eating
* My body feels calmer around food
* I’ve begun tolerating foods I couldn’t eat for years (like rice and potatoes), introduced slowly and in small amounts

**Important note:** I still experience bloating, but it no longer feels suffocating. Most importantly, I finally feel in control and have tools that truly help. This routine isn’t meant to be permanent. The goal is to support the body long enough for it to shift out of “fight or flight” and feel safe enough to digest properly. Like any other habit, this may take time too, so don’t get discouraged. I started seeing improvement in about day 10, you may see a difference sooner or later. Bodies are different.

**Here are concepts that I had to get educated on to help me learn what is going on with my body.** Please read up on them as it may give you helpful insights.

·       Cephalic phase of digestion

·       Gastric motility

·       Functional bloating

·       Nervous system state (sympathetic vs. parasympathetic)

·       Diaphragm-Gut connection

·       Chronic abdominal bracing / belly holding

·       Posture and intra-abdominal pressure

·       Pelvic floor-gut connection

·       Loss of interoception (body signals / loss of hunger signals)

I know it's triggered when someone orders an item and it gets removed from the pages on Vine, but I feel like this isn't always happening? I set the NM to run starting a 3am and end at 4pm. I figured I could let it run and catch the drops overnight and then when I'm drinking my morning coffee I could remove all of the unavailable stuff and pick through the rest. When I start looking through after removing the unavailable though there's still tons of items on the page that look like I could order them but when I click on the them it then triggers the item to be unavailable. Is it a refresh thing where I should refresh the Vine page first or go through the pages on Vine first to trigger the NM feed to mark things unavailable and then go back and click the remove button so it only shows actual items I could order? 

I leave it running during the day and have caught some cool things while half paying attention to it so it's doing fine after I start actively interacting with it, it's just before that when it seems to not do what my brain thinks it should based on how it works the rest of the day.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

**Contact activist Sinéad Whelehan obtained a photo of an “ET” while participating in a CE-5 event. Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person’s world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sinéad Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the **“Beyond Being Human” website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the “Beyond Being Human” webpage Sinéad is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness “as well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.” 

I subscribe to Jeff Mara’s Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program “**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event – ALIEN PHOTO.”** 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small “alien” being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following: 

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small “boxy” non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared. 

**Sinéad ’s Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara’s interview, Sinéad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program. The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sinéad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night. **Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.** Sinéad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sinéad Whelehan:** This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn’t know, who was in the circle. Now you’re seeing the very edge of the meditation circle…. Grant Cameron…  was there with me…. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.….**And there’s a little being right there. And here’s the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well…** 

**A**nd then here’s a really super-duper close-up version of the little being…

**Jeff Mara:** Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sinéad Whelehan:** Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience… I was feeling them to my left … You can see where my body is… and here’s the little being’s shoulder and there’s the neck, it’s head… the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.   
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sinéad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sinéad Whelehan’s personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sinéad’s  journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants. 

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sinéad experienced what she describes as a “massive awakening.” She explained the term “awakening” might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to “being bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan…” It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant. 

Sinéad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sinéad, the beings were saying, “OK. It’s time! We’ve been with you all along. It’s now time. You have a job to do!”   And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with “the extraterrestrials.” This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside. 

For two decades Sinéad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?   
  
**In the following section of this report, Sinéad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.** In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sinéad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.) 

“It’s that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.  I knew what they were telling me was real.  And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.  

An example is that I’m a teacher.  This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my “awakening” in July and about two weeks after the “big cosmic frying pan experience” happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills). 

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,” Oh my God, I have gone crazy.” 

So, I started getting worried about myself.  I went home one day… and I was very upset.  I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I’m not someone who grew up religious… I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, “I need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable….”

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.  Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual… (What) we’re supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there’s this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them… We’re supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.  They are 10-11 years old. They’re in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about “the Day I Became Famous.” It’s a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o’clock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, “the earth is alive”, “the Galaxy is full of other beings” (What) I was reading … has nothing to do with the original prompt “The Day I Became Famous.” Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child’s writing, “there’s a portal in my bedroom”, “I designed time travel”, “I made a time machine”, “the earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we’re all doing to her”. “There are spaceships out there.” I mean I just couldn’t believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, “I have to”… I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to… “I need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?” Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.  

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.  They all wrote me back and said, “Yep this is what happens.” You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) “How I Became Famous” (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th) graders, things like) “because of YouTube.” 

**Discussion:**

**How were** the non-human intelligences that contacted Sinéad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th) graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing “The Day I Became Famous”, they wrote about numerous themes associated with “ET contact.”  

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/“illusory” mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These “thought forms” might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sinéad ’s recollection of this “High Strangeness” be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called “anomalous phenomena”, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sinéad and reassuring her with a reply akin to “Yep this is what happens.”

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science’s explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong. 

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our “reality” at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the “inexplicable” events that we label “High Strangeness.” Sinéad ’s encountering a stack of “anomalous” handwritten 6^(th) grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her “friends in high places.”

**Upon return from a CE-5 mission to the Volcanic Zone where we witnessed a large silent triangular shaped craft, I experienced several High Strangeness events. These included a sighting of a 100-foot UFO over US-10. While carrying out contact protocols with my team in the Santa Monica Mountains, I heard an anomalous sound track through our research site.**

  Scot Lancer heard the foot falls of giants. Under the three moons in the clear night sky, he could see for hundreds of yards in any direction on the open rocky range. The earth still shook underfoot with the ponderous tread of titans. Off to his left side, forty yards away, a big boulder rolled aside loudly to reveal a gargantuan cave cleft.

  Out of it stepped the giants known as saldars. They averaged fifteen to twenty feet tall and were lean and muscular. Their skin was black scales, like snakes. They were humanoid, but their faces were rather reptilian, with flat noses, dark snake eyes, and mouths full of pointed teeth for eating meat. They looked like a humanoid evolved version of reptiles. They wore leather clothing, with chain mail shirts, mail kilts, greaves on their boots, and helms on their heads. They carried massive iron axes, swords, spears, hammers, wood shields, bows and arrows.

  They were emerging from a hidden tunnel the boulder had blocked so effectively that Scot was camping close to it. He'd thought he was able to see any enemies coming from any direction. He'd thought wrong. The giant saldars instantly saw him. They verbally rumbled excitedly in their harsh language. Scot was nothing they feared. He looked like a mouse to the monsters.

  Scot only stood five and a half foot tall. He was lean waisted and possessed a muscle packed, impressive, bodybuilder's physique. He was young and good looking, with blond hair and blue eyes. Numerous scars crisscrossed his face and physique. His left hand was robotics, covered in synthetic skin that soaked up solar energy to power it. That robotic hand pulled out what looked like a foot long flashlight. A yard long, scintillating, sapphire, jet of energy, ignited from the plasma torch. His right hand pulled his scoped plasma pistol, which fired plasma and ion infused, incendiary bolts. He shifted his stance as the saldars poured out of the cave mouth, eager to attack him. They believed they were dealing with a simple human.

  Scot was an Earth man, but his DNA had been altered by the bite of a rare creature called a Slypher. It made Scot's former strength and speed more than triple. He tensed for action, quickly counting over twenty saldars in sight. No words were spoken. None were necessary. Several saldars bent their behemoth bows to aim arrows over eight foot long.

  Scot's pistol barrel blossomed a ruby, refulgent round that crowned a saldar's brow, beneath his helm. The plasma and ionized incendiary bolt maimed and baked its brain. Scot's sights swiveled to a second saldar that raised his shield in time to block his head and body. Scot's barrel bloomed another bolt that smote low, torching the testicles, to bring the titan tumbling down with his dead brethren. He screamed, clutching his boiled balls.

  Scot's supernatural celerity served him well as he deftly darted, evading several stupendous shafts that swished past where he'd just stood. The party of giants charged with shields raised to block them from waist to face and their weapons waving. Scot's blaster screamed, reaming out a beam that lambasted a leg, high in the thigh. It cut the limb out from under him, so the saldar sprawled on the stones. He squealed, clutching his fried thigh, which continued cooking with crisp, sizzling and popping sounds, like bacon on a skillet. His mail had become molten where the beam bored through, like butter under a blowtorch.

  Scot's swinging sights landed on another leg that he lanced with a blast that fractured the femur while flaming the flesh. The tumbling giant tripped up his buddies that trampled him. Scot scrambled at superhuman speed, dodging and shooting, becoming a blur for his foes. He evaded another accurate arrow whizzing his way, along with a battery of blows from weapons that skated on stone instead of him. His barrel flared a fork that strobed as it drove through a shield to charbroil the chest of a saldar and lick his lung like lava.

  Scot sprang above a stamping boot. The plasma torch in his left hand was like a sparkling, sapphire sword that speared and seared through the saldar's ankle, almost entirely amputating it. He swatted aside an iron sword that stabbed at him. Then Scot was running past the lead gauntlet of giants wielding hand weapons. There was numerous archers   

  Scot's swinging sights landed on another leg that he lanced with a blast that fractured the femur while flaming the flesh. The tumbling giant tripped up his buddies that trampled him. Scot scrambled at superhuman speed, dodging and shooting, becoming a blur for his foes. He evaded another accurate arrow whizzing his way, along with a battery of blows from weapons that skated on stone instead of him. His barrel flared a fork that strobed as it drove through a shield to charbroil the chest of a saldar and lick his lung like lava.

  There was numerous archers’ farther back at an angle ahead, aiming at him. He sidestepped a sibilant hissing shaft that nearly skewered him. His plasma pistol puffed another incendiary ray that tapered an archer's torso, liquefying part of the lung. Another arrow came too close as Scot dived aside and it tripped him. He fell and tried to rise and run, but stumbled on a stone, slowing him as he sidestepped another shaft. The gauntlet of giants wielding iron weapons and swinging wood shields swarmed over him.

  Shannon appeared behind the aiming archers. She resembled a brown furred wolf, bigger than a Kodiak brown bear from Earth, but more streamlined, with muscle and no fat. But she clearly wasn't a pure wolf, because her head and mouth were more humongous than a hippo, with titanic teeth that looked like they belonged on a dinosaur. Her paws were long toed, almost like human hands, and tipped with talons she could unsheathe to reach over seven inches long. Shannon was a werebeast, made of a dark matter and dark energy, she had an alien symbiont.

  Shannon's pounce jounced against a saldar's neck, and her gaping maw snapped like an immense trap, with more power than a car compactor. Her maw muscles flexed on his neck and wrecked his mail to rive his spine. The archer gasped as he went limp as a noodle, paralyzed by the bite. He flopped on his face. Shannon instantly released him and jumped from his back to tap the ground before a bound that found another archer. He glimpsed her spring in his peripheral vision and tried to spin and strike her with his bow. Shannon's big paw batted the bow, blocking the blow, as her other paw's claws sawed through his upraised arm. She coiled her hind feet against his chest. Her dark matter talons trenched in his chest, splitting mail as she kicked to rend flesh, gutting the guy. She dove from him as he stumbled, seizing his stomach, where his intestines erupted out.

  An immense arrow slammed her shoulder like a crane's wrecking ball, bowling her over. Her dark matter, alien armored flesh, withstood the wallop, with only some bleeding from the shallow puncture. It hurt though, and her rage fueled her as she arced at the archer in a streak. He drew his dagger with one hand as the other used the bow in a low blow. Shannon nimbly weaved around the bludgeoning bow, and she lunged low, with a leap and claw sweep that flayed his foot through the boot leather and metal. She bolted by, evading the super-sized, daunting dagger that he slashed to scratch on stone, so close it almost spanked her flank.

  Shannon had reached his back and catapulted up on the nape of his neck. Her massive mouth scarfed up his neck and scissored shut, munching and crunching through mail and meat to cleave his spine asunder. A spasmodic arcing elbow rammed her ribs and sent her spinning through space as he fell. A spear almost skewered her like a shish kabob, scraping her side as she dived.  She swerved and swatted the spear aside as he tried a second thrust and cut with the immense iron blade. The spearman had a shield to block his body and head. An axe almost slashed her back from another saldar.

  She leapt and swept a deft cleft of her claws, sundering mail to lacerate the leg and gore the groin of the spearman. Blood flooded the stony ground from an open artery in his lashed leg. He grasped at his tattered testicles, where her claws carved through his codpiece. Shannon ran clear of the giants raining blows and arrows at her.

  Shannon's awesome attack had distracted the giants from Scot. He had time to recover and run. He still had to dance past some stabs, smashes, and slashes that clashed on stone near him as hammers, axes, and swords flailed at his freakishly fast figure. His plasma torch scorched through mail, flesh, and bone of a forearm as the monster missed its sword strike at him. The monster dropped its sword to grasp at its grievous injury. His blaster cast a lance of energy and the photonic flash dashed through a shield, to melt mail and char the heart of the hammer holder.    Then Scot was clear and running for the forest a few hundred yards away.

  Shannon was about fifty feet to his right, also running. They zig zagged to evade arrows zinging off strings to wing by in many near misses. The giants tried to chase them and were startlingly swift on their long legs. They couldn't match Scot and Shannon's alien enhanced speed. The man and wolf reached the trees and plunged deep into the forest. The giants were enraged and continued the search through the trees towering over them. But they had to abandon their plans of vengeance when the forest grew too thick. Scot and Shannon finally stopped fleeing.

  ""You okay? “He asked her.

  Shannon licked the puncture where the projectile had pierced deep enough to draw blood. There was another bloody scratch along her side from an axe's kiss. She nodded a yes at him.

  “You saved me, thanks."" Scot had a cut through his Kevlar shirt that drew blood, raking his ribs. He had some other superficial scrapes bleeding. “They rolled a boulder aside and came out of a hidden cave in the cliff right next to me. I'm sorry. I accidentally picked the worst place to camp. Glad you came back early. Did you have a chance to hunt?""

  Shannon shook her head, no, while looking bummed out.

  ""Yeah, I'm hungry, too. “He sighed grimly. It wasn't a promising first night on the lowlands of Tier after crossing the mountains. They'd both arrived on the primitive world together through a wormhole activated on Earth by an experimental machine in the year 2086. They survived the mountains trek and were now near the vast savanna .full of fearsome foes.

  The world was a science experiment of the alien Greys that often visited Earth in flying saucer starships, which traveled through wormholes. The Greys had populated the primitive planet with massive mammals from Earth's prehistoric age and dinosaurs, along with alien creatures. That created a lot of predators after prey.

  There were humanoid, sentient species of all sorts, most of which were hostile to strangers. They were limited to flintlock guns for firearms and primitive hand weapons. Scot and Shannon were stranded, they were heading towards a society of Caucasian people, where they could be in civilized surroundings, instead of in the wilds, constantly fighting and fleeing from mammal, dinosaur, and humanoid predators after them. Scot's Earth weapons had been a huge help thus far, but he was running low on ammo, and they had thousands of miles to trek among titans that considered them prey. 

 

 

  Above the clearing, Scot glimpsed a glowing, silvery streak, rocket by. The flying figure did an abrupt U turn and zoomed down to float beside Scot. It was a glowing, beautiful, human woman's soul. She had long, blond hair and bright, sky blue eyes, set in a fine face. She had a fantastic figure with a busty bosom, waspish waist, and lean muscled limbs. She was dressed in a silvery pants suit. Her astral energy was translucent, allowing Scot to see through her. Her name was Sharon, and she'd been Scot's partner for years. Before that she was a FBI agent that specialized in serial killers.

  ""What happened?"" Sharon blurted in concern. ""There was a hidden tunnel behind a boulder right next to camp. The boulder rolled aside and a bunch of saldars came out and attacked me. I'm lucky Shannon came back when she did or they would have got me."" Scot answered grimly.      

  “I'm sorry, Scot. I came back quick as I could,"" Sharon apologized.

  ""It's not your fault,"" Scot assured her. “Do a quick fly around the area to check for predators.""   

 

""Be right back, “Sharon zoomed flying away.

 Scot sighed. When he was a 16 year old orphan in a group home, he had his cranium cracked by a baseball bat.  He woke up from surgery able to see and hear earthbound human souls. He could see the tunnel of light that good souls traveled through to the other side. He could also see the dark wormhole to hell, and the demons that came through it to seize evil souls and drag them to hell. He couldn't see into heaven, or purgatory, where souls unworthy of heaven waited to reincarnate as infants on Earth again. Nor did the souls in heaven or purgatory get free passes to visit Earth for kicks often, so there was a lot Scot didn't know about the afterlife.

  After becoming able to see and hear souls that remained on Earth, rather than going through the light tunnel, Scot encountered Sharon, after she'd been murdered by a serial killer. Sharon begged Scot to help save her partner that was abducted by the serial killer. Scot had helped save Sharon's partner and catch the killer. That had been the start of their relationship. From there, Scot and Sharon formed a partnership.

  At the time, Scot had been a teenage runaway living on the ghetto streets of Chicago back in 2016. He looked old enough to gamble and had a fake ID. Sharon helped him cheat at playing cards in gambling casinos by telling him the cards other players had. In exchange, he reported to authorities Intel Sharon gave him about killers, rapists, terrorists, and human traffickers. Scot would only go after alpha predators. Sharon spent her time flying around spying on people, in the process, she constantly discovered killers, rapists, terrorists, human traffickers, and such. She told Scot, and he either passed the Intel on to authorities, or took a hand in the investigation to save kidnapped victims when necessary, or plant evidence of the predator's crimes to get them busted. Along the way, he kept meeting other ghosts of murdered people that remained on Earth, wanting justice against their killers.

  Scot's psychic abilities led him to working with the FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, the military, and some state agencies. He'd been in the Middle East wars on assignments and lost his left hand there from a bomb. During those years, two of the women Scot loved were killed by terrorists and a serial killer. During a CIA/military mission in the early 2020's, Scot and Sharon were both sucked through a wormhole from an experimental wormhole making machine. That wormhole opened to the primitive planet named Tier, because it was a wormhole the alien Greys often used. Scot had spent over a year on the savage planet, fleeing and fighting to survive. When he began building more advanced firearms and explosives, the alien Greys spying on their experimental world, realized he was an Earth man. They didn't want him evolving their planet's denizens with advanced weapons, so they knocked him out and took him home in their starship.    They were the same little, grey skinned, humanoids, with big heads and huge eyes, often described by people claiming to have seen aliens.

  Although he'd only spent about a year on the planet, Tier, over sixty years had passed on Earth, so it was 2086 when he reached Earth again. He then helped the CIA track down aliens on Earth that were like vampires, feeding on human blood and making hybrid, half human vampire creatures of attractive human women. The investigation had finally led to Scot, Sharon, and Shannon, tracking the final vampires to the Brazilian jungle, where they had just finished building a wormhole machine they were using to bring an army of their kind to Earth from their planet, Tier. They'd built the device largely through the skills of another alien species, called Levians. The Levians were helping them. When Scot blew the machine up, it triggered a final wormhole that sucked Shannon, Sharon, and him through. They were trapped on the planet.

  Shannon was actually a beautiful Earth woman, with long brown hair, emerald eyes, short height, and busty figure. She had been a veterinarian and real estate entrepreneur on Earth, before she was attacked by a wolfish creature that was going around killing women. It was another rare alien creature from Tier that came through a wormhole opening. But people on Earth thought it was some kind of werewolf that bullets and buckshot couldn't kill. Since the killings were occurring in her home region, Shannon had some silver bullets reloaded for her pistol. She'd survived the creature's attack, with the help of her boyfriend, and her silver bullets made the creature spontaneously combust. Like the werewolves of legends, it was highly allergic to silver. Both Shannon and her boyfriend, Tod, became werewolf creatures. Tod had been killed by the vampire aliens, which led Shannon to hunting them. Scot had been hunting the same vampire aliens and Sharon discovered Shannon's secret. The hounds on Earth wouldn't track the vampire aliens because their scent was so hot and bitter that it was like sniffing up habanero peppers. Shannon could track them. It led to Scot and her working together hunting the aliens, which led to them being stranded on the planet. During the night, Shannon transformed into the wolfish creature. By day, she was herself.

. Shannon had been bitten by the alien wolf while it was on a killing spree in her country area. People on Earth thought it was a werewolf that bullets and buckshot couldn't kill. Since the killings were occurring in her home region, Shannon had some silver bullets reloaded for her pistol. She'd survived the creature's attack, with the help of her boyfriend, and her silver bullets made the creature spontaneously combust. Like the werewolves of legends, it was highly allergic to silver.

It led to Scot and her working together hunting the aliens, which led to them being stranded on the planet. During the night, Shannon transformed into the wolfish creature. By day, she was herself. An alien parasite shared her body, comprised of dark matter, dark energy, and other alien things. While in wolf form, she was incredibly strong, fast, with superb senses, and alien armored, flesh and bones, which could withstand great violence and heal swiftly. But she wasn't impervious, just difficult to kill. In human form, she also possessed heightened physical prowess and abilities, just not as well as she did in wolf form. They'd dropped on the planet in the vampire creatures' jungle. They'd narrowly survived the experience, fighting and fleeing from the jungle up into the cold mountains, where the vampires didn't go because they were cold blooded. They couldn't handle the cold temperatures in the mountains or deal with the giant humanoids that considered the mountains their territory. That kept the vampires stuck in their jungle, unable to spread out across the savage planet. They lacked the materials, tools, and knowledge to build their own wormhole machine, especially without the Levians help. Shannon and Scot had made it through the jungle and mountains, largely through Sharon's scouting and warnings of nearby predatory threats from monstrous mammals, daunting dinosaurs, and the many savage, humanoid giants that were the top predators of the mountains. Scot's backpack from Earth had contained ammo, medical kit, and other useful supplies. But both Scot's Slypher enhanced abilities, and Shannon's werewolf parasite, provided them with greatly enhanced healing and immunity to illnesses, which had been the big factor in their survival on the deadly planet.

  But every day was a gamble.

 

 

  After Sharon let him know it was safe, Scot built up a fire. He had an iron axe and sword short with a sharpening stone he'd taken off a dead vampire months ago. He used the axe to chop wood and whittled up skewers for cooking. He had a military survival knife from Earth that he used to carve up steaks and he roasted the ribs over the roiling fire. They gorged themselves. Scot cooked extra meat they could carry on their trek. Once cooked, it would stay good for a couple days. The less they had to stop for hunting, butchering, and cooking, the safer they would be in the Conquistador's territory.

  The raging fire helped to keep most predators away. The smell of campfires in the area warned most predators that the little men with thunder sticks were near. Most predators had a healthy respect for the Conquistador's thunder sticks.

  A bold Megasaurus dinosaur was hungry enough to creep closer. It greatly resembled an Allosaurus, but was a good dozen feet longer. Sharon warned Scot, and both Shannon and he scaled the tree. When the Megasaurus stuck its huge head out, Scot's scope was steady on its skull, ready to release a roiling round. The Megasaurus was old and had grown slow with age from a gimp hind leg, wounded in a fierce fight. Rather than risk coming close to the fire, where the stag lay, it settled for one of the slain juvenile Allosaurus. Its mouth and front talons latched onto it and dragged the dead dinosaur into the brush. It continued dragging the dinosaur until it was about sixty paces away from the clearing before feeding.

  Once Sharon said it was okay, they came down from the tree to continue eating and cooking. Finally they hoisted a bunch of meat in the tree for safekeeping and slept there. At dawn, Shannon went through her transformation. She went into convulsions as the parasite hid from sunlight inside her. She became a very pretty, dark haired, green eyed, busty bosomed, short, Caucasian, little lady. She was nude and had to settle for slipping on one of Scot's homemade shirts, sewn from soft aurochs' fur. It fell to her thighs.

  Scot was stoking the fire back up. He smiled seeing her slight self-consciousness in the scanty garb. During the approximate 6 months they'd known each other, nothing sexual had happened. Shannon had deeply loved her boyfriend, Tod. After Tod was slain by the vampire aliens, she'd gone on a mission of vengeance, and had no romantic desires for anyone, except her lost love. She greatly grieved him, and had continued to do so on Tier. Scot had engaged in sexual affairs with other females over that time. He knew Shannon was grieving, and not done anything stupid, like making any passes at her. In truth, he did find her attractive. They'd seen each other nude many times while bathing and changing. But they'd stayed in the friend’s zone.

  ""Will it be stag or Allosaurus steaks for breakfast?"" Scot inquired.

  ""Stag,"" Shannon looked grumpy, rubbing sleep from her eyes."" Is it safe to wash up?""

  ""It is. Sharon's flying around on patrol. How are your wounds?""

   ""My ankle is stiff,"" she admitted. Scot noticed her ankle was still real red there, where one of the youngsters had gnawed. There were only faint red marks on her neck and face, where she'd endured very deep wounds. Shannon was limping a bit.

 ""You want some painkillers?"" Scot still had some pills in his medic kit.

  ""No. You better save them for something big. I just need more time to recover. I'm gonna wash up."" Scot pointedly turned his back to her, so she could undress and get in the deep stream. They were using soap made out of flowers' sap that grew on the planet. They brushed their teeth with toothbrushes from Earth, and the same sweet smelling flower sap. The strange purple and pink flowers seemed to grow everywhere and the stems and buds were flooded with the good smelling, honey tasting, and sap. They didn't have any coffee or tea, so water was their only beverage.

  ""Breakfast ready,"" Scot called and started eating.

  ""Thanks,"" Shannon joined him by the fire, accepting her share of steaks.

  ""You could wait here while I go get your pack,"" Scot suggested. “It’d give your ankle more time to heal.""

  ""I don't want you without back up,"" Shannon objected.

  ""Sharon will keep watch for me. You'd have trouble running on that ankle anyway. If you hang out in the tree armed, you'd be safe. I'll be back quickly.""

  Shannon briefly considered it, then nodded. “Makes sense. I'll do that.""

  Scot finished eating and washed up in the stream. Then he went with Sharon back towards the camp he'd fled from last night. Sharon flew around, keeping watch for him. He discovered the saldar bodies were gone, along with all their fallen weapons. There was plenty blood left behind. He recovered Shannon's pack, hidden behind a boulder. The pack contained all her clothing and other supplies. It was sewn together, fashioned from a cave bear's fur with a strap that she looped over her shoulder and back. When she was in wolf form, she put the loop over her neck, or had Scot haul it.

  Sharon abruptly flew back. “Bad news, Scot! There's a dozen saldars running this way from the East and they're being chased by about a hundred Conquistadors! Get out of here!""

  ""Okay,"" Scot agreed. He immediately sprinted across the open range, covering a few hundred yards in under ten seconds, with her pack bouncing on his back. Out of curiosity, he waited to watch from behind a tree.

  ""Am I okay here.” He asked Sharon.

  ""Yeah, they're coming soon from over there,"" Sharon pointed. Scot waited, watching.

  Soon thirteen saldars came running from the enormous forest trees nearby. They were carrying huge, leather sacks, containing spoils they'd stolen from some Spaniard settlers after slaying them. They reached the boulder and shoved it over. They piled in and pulled it back in place behind them, effectively disappearing.

  Moments later, over a hundred Conquistadors burst from the brush into view. They were quite an impressive sight. They were riding dark furred beasts that resembled horses, except they had clawed paws instead of hooves, and big mouths full of predatory teeth. They had saddles and bridles on, along with chain mail, and some plate armor protecting parts of them around their heads, necks, chests, and sides. They carried their riders cooperatively. The Conquistadors riders wore iron plate armor cuirasses over their bodies, and chain mail in other places. They had armbraces, greaves, girdles and helms, to protect their limbs and heads. They had short swords sheathed. Many had shields slung on their backs. They carried double barrel flintlock rifles of approximately 50 caliber. Most riders had two rifles each, so they had one in hand and another in their saddle scabbards. They each carried multiple, double barrel, pistols of approximately 44 caliber. They looked like they meant business.

  ""Wow,"" Scot muttered to Sharon. “I forget how tough they look.""

  ""They didn't get this empire by being meek,"" Sharon replied. “They’ve domesticated some wild dogs too for tracking. Check them out,"" she pointed.

  Scot noticed on the far side, some lean Spaniards, not wearing armor, were on foot running with some wild dogs on leashes. The wild dogs were spotted like African wild dogs, but big as ponies. The three canines were eagerly sniffing the ground, following the saldars' spoors right up to the boulder, where they lost the scent. Abruptly the dogs switched directions and started coming Scot's way.

  ""Scot! They're following your scent now!"" Sharon exclaimed."" Get going!""

  ""Damn,"" Scot cursed and took off. The dogs followed his spoor with laser focus, leading the Conquistadors into the forest. Scot fled for camp.

  ""We got to run, Shannon!"" Scot spat as he rushed into camp. “We’ve got over a hundred Conquistadors coming with tracking dogs! Let's go!"" He threw her pack to her and retrieved his backpack from the treetop.

  Shannon didn't ask questions. She pulled out her pants, socks, and boots from Earth. She dressed in a flash, and added her bandolier with shoulder holster, which held her 9mm machine pistol. She had a belt that held another 9mm semi auto pistol. She carried the short sword slung over her back and Scot's knife on her hip. Scot had the cooked meat wrapped up already, and they'd filled their water skins and canteen. They didn't bother trying to douse the fire or clean the scene. It was too late to hide their presence. Quite quickly, they were rushing away with Scot, following Sharon.

  Shannon was still limping, so they couldn't move anywhere near as fast as they normally did. Behind them, a hunting horn mournfully bawled out. The horn was answered by another horn ahead of them.

  ""Sharon!"" Scot barked. ""I'll check!"" Sharon zoomed away disappearing.

  ""Scot?"" Shannon asked.

  ""Sharon's checking! But it sounds like more Conquistadors ahead!"" Scot spat back. They kept going.

  Sharon returned."" Bad news, Scot! There's over fifty Conquistadors ahead, where the forest ends and savanna starts. They're ready to shoot whatever runs out of the woods. You've got to make a stand in the woods, where you have some cover. Just keep moving for now. Well find a spot.""

  Scot cursed. The wily hunting Conquistadors behind them were intending to flush their prey from the forest out into the guns of their brethren, waiting on the open savanna. It was a bad position they were in. The forest was only a few miles wide at its thickest spots and ended on either open savanna ahead, or rocky open range behind them. Scot felt both stupid and desperate. He stopped abruptly, and Shannon almost bumped into him.

  ""Shannon, we've got over a hundred Conquistadors behind us with tracking dogs. There's over fifty ahead of us, ready to shoot when we reach the savanna. We've got nowhere to go. We can't hide in the trees, because the dogs will lead them to us. If we break out of the forest to try outrunning them on the savanna, they're gonna be shooting at us in the open. Their monster horses are fast with good stamina. I don't see you doing too well on that ankle. I think we need to find a spot to make a stand in the woods, where we have cover. What do you think?""

  Shannon wasn't even breathing heavy from the run. ""So if we try to outrun them on the savanna, they're gonna have open shots at us?""

  ""Yep, and there's no other bigger woods nearby for us to flee to. It's open savanna for the next couple days travel. We're fast, but I doubt we can outrun all those guns. Especially with your ankle.""

  Shannon nodded grimly."" Then we'll have to ambush them in the trees and try doing enough damage to run them off. Do you have a place in mind?""

  ""Sharon's looking."" The baying dogs behind them were coming closer.

  ""We should keep moving, shouldn't we?"" Shannon wondered.

  ""Yeah, let's go,"" Scot moved on at a slower pace.

  Sharon rejoined them. “I found a decent place ahead. They'll have to cross the clearing and you can ambush them from some well sheltered spots. Follow me."" Scot followed Sharon's ghostly glowing, floating figure.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Article

A holy trinity of misery is smashing Victorians who say huge taxes, stupid rules and rampant crime are behind a mass exodus out of the state.

Billionaire property developers are walking away from generational, cityscape-altering projects.

Major manufacturers are seeing their taxes increase by 1200 per cent, forcing ownership to consider what was once unthinkable — closing the doors of decades-old family businesses.

A supermarket chain besieged by machete-carrying teenagers is facing the very real prospect of turning its back on Victorian stores because staff are fearing for their lives.

Small businesses are suffering, too, including cafe owners who are shutting down the long-held aspiration to work for themselves because violent thugs make pouring coffees a day-to-day risk.

It’s a grim snapshot of what it’s like doing business in Australia’s second largest economy as rampant and rising taxes, red tape and unrelenting crime form a holy trinity of misery for those trying to succeed.

Research published earlier this year appears to confirm a problem that is widespread — analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows more businesses fleeing Victoria than any other state.

Between 2022 and 2024, 3085 businesses left Victoria for elsewhere. Comparatively, Queensland welcomed 4276 new businesses over the same period.

The Victorian Government calls the statistics “cherry picked analysis from a Liberal Party-aligned think tank” and says it is “slashing red tape for businesseses”.

But the head of the Business Council of Australia has a different take. He shared a blunt assessment for what’s going on in Victoria, saying the state is sending a clear sign to the rest of the country: “Wrong way - Go back”.

""If the state that built Australia’s manufacturing heart is to turn things around, it must start by addressing uncompetitive business taxes and onerous licensing and regulatory requirements that send a clear ‘Wrong way – Go back’ sign to anyone with capital to invest,” said Business Council chief executive Bran Black.

On taxes, he said “Victoria is officially the most punitive state in Australia”.

“Whether its onerous taxes, or too much red tape, I often hear from my members that Victoria has become an increasingly harder place to do business and invest,” he told news.com.au.

“Australia’s second largest economy matters — we need Victoria to be a success.”

Right now, it is not. None of this is news to business owners, of course.

'Thank God we don’t live or work in Victoria’

“It’s a comedy, but the joke is killing us,” says Angie Romas, the boss of a company that has been involved in major building projects from Docklands Stadium to Southern Cross Station.

From his factory in Dandenong South, 41km southeast of the Melbourne CBD, Angie has watched his sandblasting, steelwork and painting business suffer through year after year of what he calls “the government stealing from Victorians”.

His land tax bill for the 17-hectare site has skyrocketed under successive Labor governments in Victoria from $8703 in 2015 to $203,600 in 2025.

""This is not a government. This is a rabble taking our money,” he told news.com.au.

“I won’t be hanging around (the next few years) to pay half a million dollars in land tax to a government because I’m working hard. Why should we give that much for nothing? We’ve gotta get out in the next 12 to 18 months.”

Angie, 60, has been collecting complainants and consulting with lawyers about a class action lawsuit against the State Revenue Office.

“If I could get a lawyer to submit a complaint against the state revenue office. I just want it to be heard by a judge who says there’s something wrong here,” he said.

In the meantime, he hears from business owners interstate. They all tell him the same thing: “They say to me, ‘Thank God we don’t live or work in Victoria’.

“We are always told that the harder you work, the more money you make. Well, not in this state.”

Developer bails due to ‘level of risk’ in Victoria

Since the 70s, billionaire Salvatore Tarascio has delivered projects all over Melbourne, including the city’s flagship IKEA store and a campus-style office precinct catering to 2250 employees.

But the developer behind Salta Properties who moved from Italy to Australia aged five has noticed a change in recent times.

His son and managing director Sam Tarascio describes it as “uncompetitive settings” in Victoria that are making it more and more difficult to do business there.

In the last year, the company sold off two pieces of prime real estate including the iconic Preston Market and 63 Exhibition Street in the Melbourne CBD.

Planning delays were behind the sale of the market — an important part of the northern suburbs visited by 80,000 people a week.

Plans for a luxury residential tower at 63 Exhibition Street were abandoned out of fear that prospective buyers would be deterred from investing in Victoria by unpredictable and increasing taxes.

A spokesperson for Salta told news.com.au the company’s position had not changed in the nine months since declaring its decision to sell was “significantly influenced by the heightened risk that exists for developers in Victoria as a result of the state government’s increased taxes, charges and levies that have been imposed on the sector”.

""It has been a regrettable decision to divest this prime asset, but we have had to take a pragmatic approach to the level of risk we are prepared to take in Victoria,” Sam Tarascio said at the time.

“In Victoria, we are focusing our attention on parts of the market where government policy is supportive... We call on the Victorian government to work more collaboratively with the property sector and re-evaluate the significant increases to taxes, fees and charges to give the sector a chance to restabilise.

“This is critical to... stop the flow of capital out of Victoria to more supportive jurisdictions.”

'We are paying a debt we didn’t contribute to’

In Melbourne’s southeast, where Mr Romas is toiling away despite hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax bills each year, others are growing equally dismayed.

Land tax, payroll tax, GST, company income tax — it goes on and on.

A survey of businesses in the region found that 100 per cent of respondents are facing extreme increases in land tax from last year.

""South East Melbourne Manufacturers Alliance CEO Honi Walker said they are “being penalised for running profitable businesses — businesses that are the engine room of our state’s economy”.

We are being asked to cover a debt that we did not contribute to,” she said.

That debt Ms Walker speaks of ballooned to $167 billion this year and is predicted to reach $194 billion in the next three years.

So dire are the state’s finances that Treasurer Jaclyn Symes will travel to New York in May next year to meet with ratings agences to personally lobby for them not to downgrade the state’s credit rating.

Businesses see the land tax increases as part of a ploy to bail out the government as debt climbs at a rate of $48 million a day.

Manufacturers are being forced to “absorb Victoria’s debt burden”, Ms Walker says.

The Business Council’s Bran Black says other taxes are just as burdensome, specifically Victoria’s payroll tax.

“Payroll tax is one of the most perverse and damaging taxes in our nation,” he said.

“It literally punishes business owners when they hire more people. On payroll tax, Victoria is officially the most punitive state in Australia.

“Big employers face a top payroll tax rate of 6.85 per cent after including surcharges – with only the ACT imposing a higher rate. And payroll tax kicks in once payrolls hit just $1 million, the equal lowest threshold in the country.

“Every new hire for a growing business costs more, and that shows in the jobs data: for 17 of the past 18 months, Victoria has recorded the highest unemployment rate in the nation.

“The link between a hiring tax and fewer hires isn’t hard to grasp. A manufacturer or builder expanding in Adelaide can pay tens of thousands less in payroll tax than if they were operating in Melbourne.”

Red tape and crime add to business woes as state stagnates

Mr Black says that a cafe owner in Melbourne “must deal with two thirds more licensing requirements to pour a cup of coffee compared to a cafe owner in Darwin”.

“That’s unnecessary red tape that deters investment and business growth,” he said.

Cafe owners are also dealing with a staggering increase in crime on their premises.

News.com.au recently spoke with Moustafa Saoud, the owner of Eleven: 11 cafe in Buckley Street, Footscray.

He revealed he was giving up on his dream after a brutal and unprovoked attack captured on CCTV.

It showed a hooded man walk through the front doors, approach Mr Saoud behind the counter and throw a punch directly at his mouth.

In the vision, Mr Saoud scrambles for safety but the assault continues. When his attacker is done, he calmly walks back out the front door.

Mr Saoud told news.com.au that the most chilling part of the attack was that not a single word was uttered.

""He didn’t say anything. Even when he left he didn’t say anything.”

He’s not the only one facing frightening incidents where diners usually go for a relaxing cup of coffee.

CCTV footage from a Moonee Ponds cafe in July showed a man threatening patrons with a knife.

The incident in the doorway of the Lil Kitch cafe showed a 37-year-old holding a knife outside the door of the cafe before punching the glass a number of times.

He was detained in a citizens’ arrest after multiple bystanders intervened to diffuse the situation before it escalated.

Supermarket chain Ritchies faces similar incidents almost daily trying to run a business in a state where violent youths think they’re untouchable.

Speaking to media in September, Ritchies IGA chief executive Fred Harrison said crime had reached a “crisis point” where “you’ve got to question when leases come up (whether you) want to remain in this area.”

Ritchies has 85 stores in Australia, including 52 in Victoria, but Mr Harrison says no other state faces the same tests Victoria does.

“I’d say 95 per cent of the issues that we are having today as a business are all in Victoria,” he said.

Master Grocers Australia board member Lincoln Meyer says somebody will be killed in Victoria if the government doesn’t do more to make running a business safer.

“There’s an escalation of violent crime, increased shoplifting, assaults within our businesses,” he told the Today Show recently.

“Shoplifting is the big one — when they do get caught, they become aggressive and abuse staff members and it’s not good enough. People just lose their minds.

“We just need some help out there. Our team members are being abused on a daily basis. Every day we hear a story of somebody being assaulted or abused.


""We were the heroes in Covid, standing up and coming to work every day. And now people abuse us and we’ve got no backing from the government.

Victoria’s new Opposition Leader Jess Wilson pounced earlier this month on new figures from the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that showed more than 92 per cent of employers reported growing concerns for staff safety.

Among key findings of a survery of more than 1400 businesses in Victoria, 35 per cent reported facing incidents weekly and 15 per cent said it happened every single day.

“Small businesses are feeling the impact of (Premier) Jacinta Allan’s crime crisis every single day,” she told media.

""More than 70 per cent said they are deferring investment decisions to increase the size of their business, employ more Victorians, because of the crime crisis in this state.”

1q8s8xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q8s8xj/the_second_rhythm/,The Second Rhythm,"I leave the flat before I decide to. The stairwell is that tired grey that does not belong to night or morning. The bulb above the notice board flickers and steadies, like it is negotiating with itself. The papers pinned there have curled into stiff little waves. Someone has written something in black marker at the bottom of one. A phone number, maybe. Or a warning. I do not lean close enough to check. I tell myself I will read them tomorrow. That is what I always tell myself. The air smells of damp stone and detergent that never quite covers anything up. My footsteps make a hollow sound on the stairs. I count them without meaning to. I lose count halfway down because I am already listening for the other thing. The front door sticks in its frame. It always has, but some mornings it feels like it sticks on purpose. I put my palm against the wood, lean my shoulder in, and the door gives way with a reluctant scrape. Too much force and it slams. Too little and it stays shut. Today I get it wrong and the door swings wider than I meant it to. It bangs against the wall, a sharp crack in the quiet, and my chest tightens like I have done something unforgivable. The lock clicks behind me. Then the pause. Not silence. A pause like a held breath, like the building itself is waiting for a second set of footsteps to come through. I feel it settle at the base of my skull. Outside, the street is wet without rain. Not fresh wet. Not clean. The sort of damp that has been sitting there for days, soaking into stone until stone looks softened around the edges. The buildings lean inward, old tenements and soot darkened sandstone, windows stacked like tired eyes. Above them, a thin ribbon of sky the colour of unwashed wool. I walk down the centre of the paving stones because the edges are broken and the sound of my shoes changes too much there. The centre is more predictable. Four steps. Then the hollow dip near the drain. After that, the sound that does not belong. It is always a fraction behind me. Not close enough to brush my coat. Not far enough to ignore. It has the same rhythm as my own footsteps but not the same weight. Like someone trying to match me without wanting me to know they are trying. I do not turn around. I have turned around before. Once, early on, when it was still possible to pretend it was just an echo. I turned so quickly my neck cracked and for a second I saw only the street bending away behind me and a smear of fog. No one there. Of course. The kind of nothing that feels worse than a person would. It made me angry in a way I did not recognise. Angry at the street for being empty. Angry at myself for expecting anything else. Now I do not turn around. The first close is narrow and dark, a slit between buildings, wet walls closing in. The smell is always the same. Wet stone and old smoke and something metallic, like a coin held too long in a warm hand. Posters cling to the walls where the glue has failed. Their colours have bled together. Blues into greys, reds into rust. Someone has torn half of one away, leaving a pale rectangle that looks too clean, like a missing tooth. Halfway down there is a shop window. It is always fogged from the inside, even when the air outside is cold enough to sting. The display never changes. The same dusty books, the same dead fern, the same small lamp with a shade that leans to one side. I stop there every morning. I do not know why. I wipe a circle clear with my sleeve. The glass squeaks softly. For a moment I see the street behind me, bending out of sight. The curve is familiar. It always looks like it is trying to hide something around the corner. I see my own face in the cleared patch. Not fully. Just a suggestion. Eyes that look like they have been rubbed too often. Skin that has gone flat. Like paper that has been handled too many times. I stare for a second longer than I should. Then the fog creeps back, slow and deliberate, sealing the circle as neatly as if I never touched it. I move again because standing still makes the second rhythm louder. At the theatre stairs the temperature drops. The stone steps always feel colder here, as if they have been storing the night for later. There is a smell of old velvet and dust near the door, and sometimes, if I stop, I can hear something inside. Not music. Just the building settling. A faint groan, like a body turning in sleep. My shoes sound sharper on the steps. The other sound does not change at all. I slow until my steps barely qualify as movement. It slows with me. I stop for half a breath. It waits. I speed up without warning, just to feel it adjust. It adjusts immediately. No stumble. No lag. It follows without effort, like it has been rehearsing my body longer than I have. That is what makes me want to run. Not fear. Something closer to disgust. Like a hand on the back of my neck that has been there so long I forgot it was not mine. The bridge is always worse. Wind hits me as soon as I step out of the shelter of the buildings. It flattens my coat against my ribs. It pushes at my face. The fog erases the river below so completely that the lamps on the far side look like they are floating in nothing, unanchored, suspended. The railing is wet. Cold enough to numb my fingers. I grip it anyway. The edges of things feel unreliable here. The pavement. The line where the bridge meets the street. The point where the air turns into fog. Even my own balance feels like something borrowed. I breathe in, hold it, let it out slowly. The breath that follows is too close to be mistaken. I do not look behind me. I do not want to see emptiness again. I do not want to see someone. I used to send messages while crossing. Small, pointless things. Weather jokes. Complaints about the cold. A photo of fog swallowing the streetlamp, captioned Look at this. The replies used to come back quickly. A laughing emoji. A complaint of their own. A question. Then the replies slowed. Then they stopped. I tell myself everyone is busy. I tell myself my phone is old. I tell myself the signal here is bad. I tell myself a lot of things. Then I stop telling myself anything at all. Now I hold the phone in my palm like a weight, screen dark. I wait for it to buzz on its own, as if it might remember I exist. The underground passage sits at the end of a short side street, a mouth in the stone with a metal gate that never fully closes. I duck inside. The smell hits immediately. Rust and old water and damp concrete. The ceiling is low enough that I can feel it pressing down even when I am not touching it. A steady drip keeps time with something I cannot see. I count tiles. One, two, three. The numbers feel safe for a moment. Then my mind slips sideways and the count turns into something else. A list of things I have not done. A list of people I have not spoken to. A list of mornings I have repeated until they have all blurred together. I lose track. I start again. I lose track again. The bend halfway down is darker than the rest. The light stops reaching it, or the darkness eats the light, I cannot tell which. I never look into it. I keep my eyes on the tiles, on the wall, on anything that does not suggest depth. Behind me, the second rhythm follows. Always the same distance. When I come out the other side, the air feels thinner for a second. Then the city closes around me again. I do not go to work. I used to. I had a place I went to. A desk. A screen. A chair that belonged to me. A routine that made sense because other people did it too. Now my days have the shape of something abandoned. I do not explain this to anyone because there is no one to explain it to. I do not even explain it to myself. The explanation would require details, and details feel slippery now. I walk until my legs feel heavy, then I walk a bit more, because the moment I stop, the second rhythm feels closer. Not physically. Something else. Like pressure increasing in a sealed room. Back in the flat, the curtains are closed. I am certain I left them open. I stand in the doorway, keys in my hand, staring at the darkened window like it is accusing me. The room smells of stale air and cold tea. There is a pile of mail on the table. Envelopes with my name printed on them in clean type. I recognise the shape of my name, but it does not feel like mine. It looks like something assigned. I sit on the edge of the bed and listen to the building breathe around me. Pipes click. Someone upstairs runs water. Someone laughs, briefly, and then the sound stops as if it was cut off. These noises prove the world still functions. What I cannot hear is anything that feels directed at me. I check the phone out of habit. No new messages. The screen lights up my hand. Pale light on skin. I stare at it too long and the light begins to feel hostile. I set the phone down face down, as if it might watch me. Sometimes, when I sit very still, I can hear the second rhythm in the flat too. Not footsteps. Something softer. A presence that has learned the layout of my room. The way the floorboards creak near the door. The way the radiator ticks. The way my own breathing changes when I try to pretend I cannot hear it. Sometimes it disappears. Those are the worst moments. The absence is not relief. It is a different kind of panic. A hollow opening under my ribs. A question with no answer. I sit very still, hands on my knees, waiting for it to come back, embarrassed by how quickly the emptiness becomes unbearable. Days blur into stretches without shape. I sleep at odd times. I wake up with my mouth dry and the taste of something sour behind my teeth. I stand at the sink and stare at the dishes and feel nothing. Not disgust. Not motivation. Just the fact of them. A stack of plates that might belong to someone else. Some days I eat standing up. Some days I forget. The hunger comes later, sharp and sudden, and I eat whatever is closest, not because I want it but because my hands keep moving. My body still obeys certain rules. It is stubborn that way. The city changes too, or maybe my perception changes, and the difference becomes impossible to tell. Streets narrow into corridors. Corridors fold into stairwells. I find myself choosing the lower routes without thinking about it. Basements. Underpasses. Closes that smell like wet clothes. The sound cannot scatter down there. It stays contained. So do I. People become an idea. The shops open. The trams run. I see the lights, the movement, but it is like watching through a pane of glass. The faces pass without detail. I cannot remember any of them later. Sometimes someone brushes my shoulder and I do not react until a second afterward, like the sensation has to travel a longer distance to reach me. When I do notice people, it is usually because I envy how ordinary they look. How their bodies take up space without apologising. Fog presses closer each week. Light smears across stone as if someone has tried to wipe it away. Doors no longer shut properly. They rock in their frames when I pass, opening just enough to show a wedge of darkness behind them. I catch myself staring into that darkness like it might contain instructions. One evening the fog is so dense I walk into it as though it were a wall. It does not stop me physically, but it stops something in my brain. The bridge disappears. The stairs disappear. The end of the street disappears. I stand there in the middle of the pavement, heart thudding, and for a moment I cannot remember which direction leads back to my flat. Behind me, the second rhythm stops too. It waits. I choose a direction at random and begin walking. The rhythm follows. Patient. Another night I hear my name hidden inside my own breathing. It is not a voice. Not a sound from outside. It is more like my breath takes on the shape of the word. A syllable in the exhale. I stop and hold my breath, waiting to see if it happens again. It does not. The silence that follows feels like it is laughing at me. I begin to avoid mirrors. Not deliberately. It just happens. Reflections are everywhere in a city like this. Wet pavement. Café windows. Black glass. Puddles. I look past them all. Once, in the window of a closed shop, I catch my outline and do not recognise the angle of my shoulders. My head looks slightly too forward, like I am always listening. My posture looks like someone expecting a blow. The fog closes the surface before I can decide if it was really me. My thoughts fragment into smaller pieces. I notice. I hear. I stop. I start walking again. There are days when I can almost pretend the second rhythm is a person. A stranger with bad intentions. A stalker. Something external. Something I could call the police about. Something I could point to and say, This is why I am like this. But it never does anything a person would do. It never speaks. It never rushes. It never reaches out. It follows with the calm certainty of gravity. I try changing my routes. I try staying in bright places. I try sitting in a café again once, ordering a coffee I cannot taste. I sit at the table and stare at the foam until it collapses into brown. The chatter around me sounds like it belongs to a different species. The second rhythm does not appear in the café. Not as footsteps, anyway. But when I lift the cup, my hand shakes. When I set it down, the saucer clinks. And in the pause between those sounds, I still feel it. Not behind me now. Inside the space my body occupies. I leave without finishing the coffee. I keep walking. The city is all layers. Streets on streets. Stairs that lead to bridges that lead to closes that drop into underpasses. Sometimes I end up somewhere high, where the wind is stronger and the fog looks thinner, and for a moment I can see more of the city than I usually let myself see. Rooflines. Chimneys. A spire cutting into the sky. The bones of the place. Even then, it feels like I am looking at a model rather than a home. Tonight the air is colder than it has been in weeks. The fog hangs lower, heavy as cloth. The streetlamps glow in soft halos. My breath is visible. Each exhale a small ghost that vanishes immediately. I walk toward the river without telling myself I am doing that. I just find myself there. The familiar bridge. The familiar wind. The familiar sensation that the world has edges here, and that the edges are close. The railing is wet. My hands stick to it slightly, skin against metal. The river is a dark suggestion below, mostly erased by fog, but I can hear it. A low, constant movement. Not waves. Not exactly. Just the sound of something continuing whether I am watching or not. The second rhythm is behind me. Of course it is. I lean forward a little, not enough to lose balance. Just enough to feel the pull in my stomach. There is a thought that arrives so calmly it scares me. Not a dramatic thought. Not a sudden urge. Something quieter. If I let go, this would stop. Not the river. Not the city. Not time. Just the constant pressure. The second rhythm. The endless effort of moving through damp air and stone corridors and waking up inside the same grey. My fingers tighten on the railing until my knuckles ache. I do not move. I imagine stepping away from myself. I imagine the absence like a blank page. Clean. Quiet. No footsteps. No waiting. No pauses after locks click. No fog sealing over reflections. No counting. No starting again. The thought is not violent. It is almost gentle. That is what frightens me most. Behind me, the second rhythm stops. I can feel it standing there, as if it has leaned in too. I close my eyes. The wind presses into my face. My eyelashes wet. My breath comes in shallow, clipped pulls, like I am trying not to exist too loudly. The metal under my hands feels colder. It is pulling heat out of me with quiet efficiency. And then, in the middle of that, something changes. Not outside. Inside my chest. A small, ridiculous detail surfaces, uninvited. The notice board in the stairwell. The curled papers. The marker scrawl. The way the bulb flickers like it cannot commit. The way the front door sticks and how I have learned exactly how much force it needs. For some reason, I think about how tomorrow morning, if I am there, I will know how to open that door again. It is not hope. It is not a grand revelation. It is just the fact of a habit. A thread. Something still connected. My grip loosens slightly. I take one fuller breath. My lungs complain, then accept it. I open my eyes and look down at the fog and the sound of the river and the soft blur of lamplight on wet stone. I step back from the railing. Just one step. The second rhythm steps back too. I stand there, heart hammering, and I feel ridiculous and exhausted. I wait for the thought to return. It hovers at the edge of my mind, but it does not land again. Not yet. I turn around. There is nothing new. Stone. Shadow. Damp air. But when I breathe, the space behind me moves in perfect time with my chest, so close that I cannot tell where I end and it begins. The realisation does not arrive like a sentence. It arrives like weight. It has never been behind me in the way I pretended. It has been with me. In me. Around me. Wearing my rhythm like a coat. I stand there for a long time, hands hanging loose at my sides, staring into the fog as if it might explain itself. The bridge creaks softly under my feet. Somewhere in the distance a tram bell rings once. Then again, further away. I take another step away from the edge. The second rhythm follows. Patient. Familiar. I start walking. For the first few metres, my footsteps sound loud and alone on the stone. Then the other rhythm returns, not as an echo exactly, not as a person, but as a pressure that slots into place behind my ribs like it has always been there. I do not run. I do not fight it. I just keep moving, because the act of moving is still something I can do. Halfway across the bridge I pull my phone from my pocket. The screen is cold against my thumb. I do not open any messages. There are none. I do not call anyone. I could. I do not. I unlock it anyway. The light fills my palm. I stare at the blankness for a second, then turn it off again. Still, the fact that I touched it feels like something. A small signal. When I reach the far side of the bridge, the wind eases. The tenements close in again. The city becomes narrower. The fog thickens. The route home is the same as always. The stairwell near the river waits. The bulb hums. The notice board papers curl. The door will stick. There will be a pause after the lock clicks. And I will be there to feel it.",1,1768012680.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

""Finnian, I swear to f—"" The curse barely left Julian Blackwood's mouth before a long, elegant hand sealed it shut.  
  
Finnian Grey leaned in, lips brushing the side of Julian's neck. His voice was low, intimate, right against Julian's ear.  
  
""Hey,"" he said softly. ""Easy there, sweetheart. You've got a filthy mouth when you're worked up.""  
  
The bedroom doors and windows stood wide open. Thin curtains stirred lazily in the night breeze, drifting back and forth, restless and slow.  
  
Julian lay sprawled across the bed, every joint loose, boneless. He didn't even try to move.  
  
His gaze dragged over the red scratch marks streaking across Finnian's bare back as he forced out, voice rough, ""Take the money. Get the hell out. And don't ever show your face in front of me again.""  
  
Finnian sat down at the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette, like he hadn't heard a word.  
  
His tone, when he spoke, was flat, almost lazy. ""I want resources.""  
  
Julian let out a short, sharp laugh. ""You really don't know when to quit, do you?""  
  
Finnian didn't bother turning around. The cigarette flared between his fingers, then dimmed.  
  
""So that's a no,"" he said. ""After all that?""  
  
The calm in his voice made Julian's jaw tighten.  
  
Julian scoffed. ""You think tonight buys you anything?"" His eyes were cold. ""Let me make this clear. If a single word about what happened here gets out, I'll bury your career so deep no one will remember your name.""  
  
'Just a third-tier actor under his own company. Bold enough to crawl into my bed, take everything I gave, and then ask for more. Unbelievable,' he thought.  
  
Julian waited for the blowback. Anger. Defiance. Something.  
  
But nothing came.  
  
Finnian stubbed out the cigarette and stood, completely unfazed. He started getting dressed as if Julian weren't even there.  
  
He bent down, tossed aside the torn shirt without a glance, then picked up Julian's clothes from the floor and slipped into them slowly, deliberately.  
  
Julian watched him, irritation mixing with something far less controlled. He'd spent years surrounded by beautiful people. Faces sculpted for cameras. Bodies trained to perfection.  
  
He should have been immune by now.  
  
But Finnian was different.  
  
The way his shoulders rolled as he moved. The solid strength of his chest. The smooth, controlled lines of muscle, powerful without showing off. And those legs. Long, straight, unapologetically strong.  
  
Julian swallowed, heat stirring again despite himself.  
  
Unfortunately, his body had already hit its limit. One more round and he'd be paying for it for days.  
  
Julian waited for Finnian to push again. To negotiate. To say something sharp, something needy.  
  
Instead, Finnian fastened his belt and turned.  
  
He stepped in close, close enough that Julian could smell smoke and skin. Two fingers tilted Julian's chin up. He pressed a brief kiss to Julian's lips. Then he reached for his phone on the nightstand.  
  
""Alright,"" Finnian said casually. ""I'll get out of your hair.""  
  
And just like that, he turned and walked away. No pause. No look back.  
  
Under the soft glow of the bedside lamp, the check Julian had filled out earlier lay exactly where he'd left it. Untouched.  
  
Julian stared at it. Then at the empty doorway. It took several long seconds to sink in that Finnian was really gone. For a moment, Julian couldn't even tell who had taken advantage of whom.  
  
The frustration hit hard and fast, tight in his chest. With nowhere to put it, he grabbed his phone and dialed his secretary, Lucas Prescott.  
  
""Where are you?"" Julian demanded.  
  
It was four in the morning. Lucas's voice came out groggy and disoriented. ""Mr. Blackwood? I'm—""  
  
Julian cut him off. ""Doesn't matter. Where's Marcus?""  
  
Lucas froze.  
  
Everyone knew Marcus Harrington and Julian went way back. Brothers in everything but blood. Marcus's smooth rise through the industry hadn't happened by accident.  
  
If Julian didn't know where Marcus was, Lucas sure as hell wouldn't.  
  
But with his meal ticket on the line, saying that out loud wasn't an option.  
  
""At this hour,"" Lucas said carefully, ""Marcus should be back on set.""  
  
Julian let out a short, humorless laugh. ""Call him. Tell him I said he can rot there. Stay on that set for the rest of his life if he has to. Don't come back to see me again.""  
  
There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end. ""Right now?""  
  
Julian's voice dropped. ""What, you think I'm joking?""  
  
The line went dead before Lucas could respond. Julian powered off his phone and let it fall onto the bed beside him.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
When Finnian stepped out of Julian's place, the world was still suspended in that fragile hour before dawn. The street looked abandoned, kept alive only by a few streetlights that flickered like they were exhausted by the effort of existing.  
  
He walked without direction, letting his feet decide for him, until the glow of a twenty-four-hour diner pulled him in.  
  
Inside, he ordered a greasy plate of pancakes with bacon and sat on a high stool by the window. He ate slowly, mechanically.  
  
Halfway through, something shifted deep in his chest, a faint pressure. He paused, staring out at the empty street. The memory refused to settle into words. Finnian exhaled, pushed it aside, and lifted another skewer.  
  
Then the static tore through him. The mental barrier he had erected shattered under the sudden surge of noise, electricity screaming through his skull with brutal clarity.  
  
\[Are you out of your fucking mind? Are you trying to get yourself killed?\]  
  
\[I told you to win him over. To get inside his heart. I did not tell you to fuck him the moment you met him!\]  
  
Finnian blinked. 'Right. That.' Earlier, he had muted the Judicator assigned to monitor him. It had seemed unnecessary at the time. An inconvenience.  
  
Now Astrael's voice filled his head, raw with panic and fury. Finnian frowned, more irritated than alarmed. The Judicator was loud, dramatic, and profoundly annoying.  
  
\[He wanted it,\] Finnian said evenly. \[And you told me to take him down.\]  
  
Silence followed. Long. Heavy. The kind that carried the weight of regret.  
  
Astrael had believed itself experienced. Hardened. Capable of handling any mess the heavens threw its way.  
  
And yet, standing knee-deep in this disaster, it could only think that the job was hell, the pay wasn't worth it, and the universe had a sick sense of humor.  
  
Finnian was ancient ice pulled from the deepest abyss, frozen there for ten thousand years.  
  
By the time he took human form, he was already god-adjacent, stationed in the Divine Realm, enforcing divine law with absolute detachment.  
  
So sending him into a human world to erase the soul fragments of fugitives made sense. It was dull, contained, and orderly. The kind of work Finnian was made for.  
  
Then the phoenix Julian got his thread of fate tangled during his trial. Somehow, fixing that mess became Finnian's responsibility.  
  
Worse, the Sovereign decided Julian himself would be part of the solution.  
  
Julian, who was anything but pure, was now supposed to soften Finnian, to teach him empathy, to melt ten thousand years of abyssal ice with warmth  
  
And this cosmic hot potato everyone else dodged landed squarely in Astrael's lap.  
  
By the time it finished the formalities and rushed to initiate protocol, Finnian had already blocked all communication. And Julian was already gone.  
  
When Astrael remained silent for too long, Finnian finally spoke again. \[Did something go wrong with the target?\]  
  
The question was sincere. That was the problem.  
  
He had touched Julian's skin without knowing his fate. Finnian had acted first, as he always did. By instinct. By rule.  
  
Astrael clenched down on its fury. \[Yeah. Something went very wrong.\]  
  
Finnian frowned slightly. \[Then why are you losing your shit?\]  
  
Astrael had no answer.  
  
Instead, it flooded Finnian's mind with Julian's intended life. Every path he was meant to walk. Every love he was meant to survive. Every ending that was never supposed to include Finnian. The information hit hard.  
  
Finnian lifted his milk and drank, calm and steady, as if nothing inside him had shifted at all.  
  
Chapter 2 Crawl Into My Bed  
The Blackwood family did not simply have money. They had history. Decades ago, they built their fortune overseas through businesses that lived in the shadows.  
  
When the domestic market began to boom, they moved fast, pivoting cleanly into entertainment before anyone else caught on.  
  
One after another, they packaged and launched idols who became legends, names known in every household.  
  
Julian's older sister took control of the overseas operations, the part of the empire that still carried stains. What remained, the polished and respectable entertainment company at home, was handed to Julian, the Blackwood family's only heir.  
  
Their father, Elijah Blackwood, was already in failing health, and the decision came early.  
  
Julian was tall and broad-shouldered, all long legs and sharp lines. He treated his body like capital, maintained it with almost obsessive discipline.  
  
When he officially took over the company at twenty-four, female artists swarmed him. Some flirted. Some chased. Some all but threw themselves at his feet.  
  
But none of them ever got anywhere.  
  
Before long, the industry started whispering. People said there was something off about Julian. That maybe his tastes were not what they were supposed to be.  
  
Yet anyone who actually watched him knew one thing for sure. Whether it was the way he spoke, the way he stood, or the way he looked at people, Julian was never going to be the submissive one.  
  
Male artists began testing the waters, inching closer, dropping hints, hoping to be noticed.  
  
The outcomes were brutal. The lucky ones were shelved indefinitely. The rest vanished from the industry without explanation.  
  
In the life fate originally wrote for him, Finnian was straight.  
  
One candid street photo sent him viral overnight. He debuted at the peak most actors never reached, landing the lead role in a television drama adapted from a popular gay romance novel.  
  
Within weeks, his face was everywhere. He was branded the embodiment of the cool, aloof fantasy, the untouchable top-tier presence fans worshipped.  
  
It also trapped him. That image narrowed his future until there was barely any road left to walk.  
  
Then luck turned against him completely. Regulatory crackdowns hit, and the series was quietly pulled from streaming platforms not long after it aired. Just like that, his rise stalled.  
  
After a brief period of silence, Finnian took on a few conventional projects. Straight romances. Safe scripts. None of it landed. Longtime fans felt uneasy watching him paired with women, like the chemistry was fundamentally wrong.  
  
The louder, uglier voices accused him of exploiting queer themes for attention, calling him fake, calculating, disgusting.  
  
Cornered and desperate, Finnian began considering options he never wanted to face. Risky ones.  
  
And right on time, opportunity found him.  
  
Marcus Harrington was a reigning movie star, a box office guarantee. Publicly, he was Julian's closest friend.  
  
Privately, he was the heir to a long-standing vendetta against the Blackwood family. His family had been enemies of the Blackwoods for generations.  
  
He had changed his name, erased his past, and made his way into Julian's inner circle with one goal in mind: revenge.  
  
But Julian had grown up inside the Blackwood family. Suspicion was instinct.  
  
Even when he genuinely treated Marcus like a brother, he never shared the dark secrets of his family. Marcus was never allowed anywhere near the company's inner workings.  
  
And that was when Marcus turned his attention to Finnian.  
  
Marcus offered him a deal: he would help Finnian get close to Julian, clear the path for his career, and once it was over, Marcus would make sure Finnian had enough money to disappear and start fresh somewhere else.  
  
All Marcus wanted in return was evidence of Julian's financial crimes.  
  
A massive empire like the Blackwoods was never built on clean hands.  
  
Finnian agreed.  
  
After a company party, once the crowd had thinned and the alcohol had done its job, Marcus grabbed Finnian by the arm.  
  
Julian was drunk, staggering a little, and Finnian had been hanging around them all night, like a shadow.  
  
""Take him home,"" Marcus had said with a careless shrug. ""Just get him back to his place.""  
  
Julian didn't protest. Finnian didn't leave after they arrived.  
  
He swallowed his disgust and moved in to seduce Julian.  
  
But just as he was about to follow through, Julian stopped him. His voice went sharp, cold, and he ordered Finnian out of his house.  
  
Finnian's stomach sank. He had no patience for Julian's moods. He was about to give up entirely when Julian, unexpectedly, changed his mind. He decided to keep him.  
  
What Finnian never saw coming was the truth behind Julian's so-called ""celibacy."" Julian was, without question, gay. But he was not the dominant force that everyone had assumed.  
  
Finnian had no choice. He did not like men. Every time he was with Julian, it felt like he was slowly suffocating.  
  
Julian, on the other hand, liked Finnian's body, his face. Everything else about him disappointed Julian.  
  
He trained Finnian as one might train a dog: absolute obedience. Anticipate every mood. Perform on command. Even if you don't love me, act like you do.  
  
Julian knew Finnian didn't care for him. He knew Finnian was only there for resources, for leverage, for survival. But Julian didn't care. He wanted compliance. A well-behaved toy.  
  
Finnian shared Julian's bed, but never his trust.  
  
Finnian could endure. Marcus, though, could not.  
  
The tension grew. Marcus saw through the cracks, knew Finnian was unraveling. The man was still straight at his core, and that was eating him alive.  
  
So, Marcus set a trap. He drugged Finnian. While Finnian's mind was clouded, Marcus hired a woman—a sex worker—and sent her to Finnian's bed. Then he tipped off Julian.  
  
When Julian found them together, it all exploded. Rage. Fury. He grabbed Finnian, fists flying, his voice filled with poison.  
  
The woman, egging it on, pushed Julian further. In the chaos, Julian lost control. Finnian's head hit the sharp edge of the coffee table.  
  
He died in an instant. The cameras caught everything. The reporters burst through the door, their lenses flashing, and the scandal detonated.  
  
No matter how powerful the Blackwood family was, no matter how many strings Julian could pull, prison was inevitable.  
  
\[Mission: Cleanse the soul fragments of the fugitive Marcus. Replace the original host, Finnian. Win Julian's genuine heart.\]  
  
Getting tangled in the wrong thread of fate was its own special kind of hell.  
  
It forced a bond where none should exist, binding together people who were never meant to fit, let alone fall in love. This wasn't destiny doing its quiet work. It was a curse, plain and simple.  
  
Finnian thought it was absolute bullshit.  
  
To him, all he had done was refuse a bribe. All he had done was carry out a lawful execution, killing the only son of a decorated hero of the Divine Realm, stripping him of his immortal essence, and casting him back into the mortal world to start over as a human being.  
  
And for that, Finnian was punished, demoted, and thrown into this world to complete a mission so hollow it felt like an insult.  
  
And Finnian had known Julian for a long time. Far too long.  
  
Julian was infamous in the Divine Realm, a first-class bastard with a reputation everyone knew and no one could touch.  
  
He was impossible to control, impossible to corner. He lived right on the edge of divine law, treated it like a game, pushed boundaries until everyone else lost their patience, yet somehow never crossed the one line that would justify taking him down.  
  
Finnian had watched him for years. Shadowed him. Clashed with him more times than he cared to remember.  
  
And still, there was never a clean opening, never a charge that would stick, never a reason solid enough to end it.  
  
It was infuriating.  
  
When Finnian entered this world, he landed directly on the night Julian got drunk out of his mind, the same night the original host walked him home for the first time.  
  
The original Finnian had barely gotten Julian through the door before Astrael ripped his soul away.  
  
The transfer wasn't even finished when Finnian was forced in to take over.  
  
In the chaos, Astrael managed only teo words before disappearing completely. \[Take him.\]  
  
So when Finnian followed Julian into the bedroom, and Julian turned around, drunk and already irritated, asking why he was still there and why he hadn't left yet, Finnian didn't bother softening the blow.  
  
""Marcus sent me,"" he said evenly. ""Said I should get into your bed.""  
  
Julian knew Finnian. Not personally, but enough. There had been a period when Julian quietly followed Finnian's rise, watching his career unfold from a distance with idle interest.  
  
Still, as a boss, Julian had never never crossed paths with him.  
  
Even earlier that night, when Finnian had taken the driver's seat and driven him home, they hadn't exchanged a single word.  
  
Which made it almost impressive that the first sentence Finnian ever said to Julian managed to irritate him and amuse him at the same time.  
  
Julian sat at the foot of the bed, posture loose, gaze slow and deliberate as it traced Finnian's face. Perfect features. Calm, controlled presence. Eyes so intense they felt like they could swallow light.  
  
""So let me get this straight,"" Julian said, lips curling into a lazy grin. ""Marcus tells you to show up, and you just do it. What are you, his damn lapdog?  
  
""Get out.""  
  
Julian had already prepared himself for resistance. For Finnian to cling, to argue, maybe even beg for a chance.  
  
Part of Julian wanted to see it. He wanted to see someone like Finnian brought low, asking for permission.  
  
Everyone knew Julian's bed was untouchable. No one had ever made it there. And if one did, the rewards were the kind people whispered about.  
  
But that wasn't how it went.  
  
Finnian just said, ""Alright,"" turned around, and walked out. He actually left.  
  
And for some reason, that pissed Julian off more than anything else. The smile vanished from Julian's face.  
  
""Get your ass back here,"" he snapped.  
  
Finnian stopped at the doorway and glanced over his shoulder. ""You sure you want that?""  
  
Julian leaned back on his hands, letting the alcohol hum through his veins, eyes sharp and dangerous as they locked onto Finnian.  
  
""Aren't you here to crawl into my bed?"" Julian said, voice low, almost amused. ""Fine. Come on, then. But if you don't do it right, I'll make sure you won't even know how you died.""  
  
Chapter 3 Leave Him Spent In The Sheets  
Julian had always been striking. Deep-set eyes, sharp features, the kind of face that held attention without asking for it. With the alcohol loosening his control, his gaze on Finnian turned unfocused, almost indulgent.  
  
His legs were planted on the floor, posture loose, body radiating a restless hunger, unfulfilled and unapologetic.  
  
Finnian hated that look. He walked back to the bed and stopped right in front of Julian, looming over him.  
  
When he grabbed Julian by the chin and kissed him, it wasn't gentle. It felt confrontational, like he was starting a fight instead of an affair.  
  
Julian had lived clean for twenty-eight years. Disciplined. Restrained. But once that restraint cracked, it shattered fast. The spark caught instantly, fire racing through him before he could stop it.  
  
He reached out and tore Finnian's thin shirt apart in one rough motion.  
  
The fabric ripped under his hands, and the already fragile buttons snapped loose, scattering across the floor in sharp clatters.  
  
To the outside world, Julian was the textbook alpha. He had never hidden his sexuality. What he could never quite say out loud was the fact that he wasn't a top. That truth sat heavy in his chest.  
  
Somewhere in the middle of things with Finnian, his interest faltered. Just briefly. He even thought about telling Finnian to leave, to get out before it went any further.  
  
But Finnian didn't let it drift in the direction Julian expected.  
  
Beneath Finnian's cold, detached exterior was a decisiveness, an assertiveness that caught Julian off guard.  
  
Once it surfaced, it was impossible to ignore. After that, everything followed naturally, one moment slipping into the next, smooth and inevitable.  
  
When Julian finally hit the edge of what he could take, he lost whatever composure he had left. He cursed viciously.  
  
The harder he cursed, the more energized Finnian seemed, like he was determined to push Julian past every limit, intent on leaving him utterly spent in the sheets.  
  
When Astrael reviewed the earlier scene, there were no visuals to process. Only sound. A chaotic mix of shouted insults, raw exchanges, and countless indecent noises, most of them forcibly masked by sharp, repetitive beeps.  
  
Out of Finnian's sight, Astrael held itself together with sheer force of will.  
  
After a long moment, it finally steadied itself and asked through clenched teeth, \[What are you planning to do next?\]  
  
Finnian finished the last of the oden on the table, pulled out a napkin, folded it neatly into a square, and wiped his mouth before answering, \[Go home. Sleep.\]  
  
Then, as if something occurred to him, he took out his phone, which had been set to silent.  
  
Sure enough, the lock screen was filled with missed calls from an unfamiliar number.  
  
The moment he answered, Marcus's voice exploded through the receiver, loud enough to make Finnian wince.  
  
""I told you to take him home,"" he said. ""So where the hell did you actually take him? I've called you a hundred damn times and you didn't pick up once. If you're gonna carry a phone, maybe try using it, huh?""  
  
Marcus had rushed back to the set overnight. He had barely hit the bed and closed his eyes when Julian's secretary had called and tore into him without warning, all fury and zero explanation.  
  
Getting chewed out like that, Marcus could only think of one person who might have set Julian off, and that was Finnian.  
  
Finnian stood up and pushed open the convenience store door as he spoke.  
  
""I took him home. Didn't hear the phone,"" he said.  
  
Marcus didn't sound convinced. ""So what did you do to piss him off?""  
  
Finnian replayed the night in his head, carefully, honestly. ""Nothing. I went along with whatever he wanted.""  
  
Marcus hesitated, then tested the waters. ""Did you… stop halfway? Did he not get enough?""  
  
""No,"" Finnian said flatly.  
  
He hadn't stopped. Julian had told him to stop more than once, but Finnian could feel the state he was in. He was saying one thing and meaning another.  
  
Finnian hadn't pulled back. Details like that didn't seem worth unpacking with Marcus.  
  
Marcus clearly didn't want a blow-by-blow either. He tried again, more cautiously. ""Did he ask for anything… specific? Something you didn't catch, or didn't agree to?""  
  
Finnian raised an eyebrow. ""Like what?""  
  
They were both adults. Some things didn't need to be spelled out. Marcus kept it vague. ""You know. That kind of thing.""  
  
Finnian was an ice block.  
  
He could learn. He could follow instructions and carry out tasks with unsettling precision. He had lived long enough, seen enough of the world to understand how things worked in theory.  
  
But when it came to real experience, actual practice, he was still operating on instinct alone. He knew the rules, yet somehow they had never fully fused with his body.  
  
So when the question came, he only said, ""He didn't ask.""  
  
Marcus knew Julian well enough to read between the lines.  
  
Julian cared deeply about his image. He had standards, expectations even, but he almost never voiced them outright. Pride got in the way. Always had.  
  
The moment Finnian said that, something clicked for Marcus. He sucked in a breath, irritation flashing hot and sharp. ""Jesus Christ. The guy practically shoved the opportunity into your mouth and you still managed to choke on it.  
  
""If he doesn't spell everything out for you, you seriously can't take a hint?  
  
""Finnian, this world is overflowing with people who know exactly how to please Julian. If you still want to make it in this industry, if you want to actually get somewhere, you'd better start putting in the effort yourself.""  
  
He hung up.  
  
A few seconds later, a text popped up: \[Don't say this came from me.\]  
  
Finnian deleted it without hesitation. He stood on the sidewalk for a moment, then opened a shopping app and carefully selected several books that looked aggressively professional.  
  
When Astrael saw the titles, it felt a quiet sense of despair settle deep in its core. \[The Thirty Six Strategies of Love\], \[How to Get a Grip on the One You Love\], \[Mastering Emotional Control\], \[How to Drive Them Wild\], \[Three Moves to Make Them Beg for More in Bed\].  
  
'The road ahead is going to be long. Painfully long,' it thought.  
  
Still, if there was one thing to be said for Finnian, it was this: he was willing to learn. And he listened when people spoke. That alone gave Astrael a thin, fragile thread of comfort.  
  
Housing prices in Helningen City were obscene. The body Finnian now occupied came from an unremarkable background.  
  
His parents were factory workers in a small county town. He had only been in the entertainment industry for a year, barely enough time to build any real savings.  
  
The money he made last year went mostly back home, helping his parents upgrade to a modest three bedroom apartment. What little remained went toward a basic car.  
  
Which meant that in Helningen, all he could afford was a rental in a decent location. Convenient transportation, livable surroundings, but old, bland, and painfully unremarkable.  
  
Security was minimal. Cameras everywhere, sure, and two elderly guards taking shifts at the entrance, but that was about it.  
  
Aside from his looks, the original owner of this body had been painfully average.  
  
And like most men living alone, he hadn't escaped chaos.  
  
Clothes were piled on the couch. The wardrobe doors hung open. Socks and underwear sat forgotten in the laundry basket, waiting far too long to be dealt with.  
  
Finnian came home and didn't say a word. He spent the entire day stripping the apartment down, removing everything that served no purpose. Not even a decorative trinket survived.  
  
He went through three full bottles of disinfectant and an entire bag of detergent, washing everything that hadn't been cleaned in ages and hanging it out on the balcony.  
  
Old underwear went straight into the trash. New ones were unpacked, folded into crisp, perfect rectangles, and lined up neatly in storage boxes.

1q8s7q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/seoul/comments/1q8s7q6/searching_what_is_goal_of_life/,searching what is goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1q8s77o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8s77o,Costa Rica Pastora Black Honey: roasting issues with the SR800,"I’m having issues with over carbonization of some beans with this black honey process. I have experience roasting natural process Ethiopians, and I’ve never had this issue.

When roasting the first batch (photo #1), I was getting smells of second crack when I had just started the first crack. I noticed dark spots on some of the beans, so on the second batch (photo #2), I kept the heat at 1 the entire roast. This delayed first crack to around nine minutes, but it did help reduce the carbonization (I didn’t notice the second crack smells at all).  For both roasts I kept the beans moving vigorously with the airflow. The problem is, as you can see in the second photo, there are still some beans that have dark spots. Peppered throughout are beans that look like the bean in the third picture, but the rest of the beans look fine.

Has anyone experienced this issue when roasting black honey process and what did you do to fix it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I’m hoping I didn’t ruin this batch.",2,1768012544.0,roasting,3,1.0,False

1q8ryqr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8ryqr,Cuisinart Espresso & Coffee Conical Burr Grinder,"

Purchased Cuisinart's newer bean grinder (at least in Canada) as my first non-blade grinder.

All the other decent options are double the price, so I wanted to see if this was good or not. Very new to the coffee/espresso space. Long time drinker, but just started to take interest.

Wonder if others had thoughts on the quality.

Image #1 - this is about as fine as I can get it on the blade grinder. I ran it for longer than usual to get it fine.

Image #2 - this is the Cuisinart grinder on MEDIUM grind size (20/35). Seems similar size to the blade grinder. Wish it was a bit more consistent, but not sure what to expect as again I've never had a (Conical) burr grinder. Still more consistent than the blade grinder.

Image #3 - this is size the Cuisinart grinder again on FINE grind size (1/35). Seems pretty fine and consistent. Curious to know everyone's thoughts. Didn't seem to have any issues grinding it either as some reviews suggested.

Image #4 - the burr itself, slightly dirty from these tests. I obviously cleaned it a tad with blowing it out.

Thoughts? Slightly underwhelmed by the grind consistency but surprised how fine it can get. Reviews were leading me to believe the opposite.

1q8ru1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1q8ru1h/its_been_a_month/,It's been a month,"I've met my ex girlfriend 3 years ago while I was out with 2 friends of mine(1 boy and 1 girl), got along pretty well that night and she asked for my Instagram and the other girl's Instagram. We started talking after 1 week and both of us felt for eachother very fast and ended in a relation after 2 weeks. Everything was perfect for the first month's until one day I've caught her lying to me about working extra hours but she was just talking to her colleagues after work. After that night my trust was broken but everything can be repaired if both sides try enough. She continued to lie to me and every time ended in a ""fight"" because she was not emotionally immature. As the time goes on I started too feel not enough, I was always asking for her to french kiss me, to initiate fun time and the list goes on. As we continued to ""fight"" for 3 or 4 time a week I started to feel emotionally drained and I was getting colder and colder until 1 day she wanted to break up with me. I stayed with her on the phone for 1 hour to try to convince her to give the relationship another chance even if I knew that my part of the hurting was considerable smaller than hers. We've got back togheter and I started to sleep 2 to 3 hours a night because I was searching for clues, for help, for answers just to get the relationship back togheter but I've told her that one day if I continue like this and she doesn't try to change anything or to work for the relationship I will get emotionally drained again and I don't think I could do anything for us after that. Things were going good because I was the one doing all the hard work while she did nothing but hurt me with the same stuff that I told her before getting in a relation, and I mean by that all my past trauma, lying, and generally hurting me. Few months go by she is still doing the same stuff while I'm trying to communicate with her to try and stop hurting me but with no succes, she started doing all of that stuff more frequently.. One day as I woke up(we moved togheter meanwhile) she kissed me so soft that our lips barely touched, that moment my heart shattered in hundreds of pieces, I was totally drained and hurt and couldn't do anything more. For 3 days she barely spoke to me and kissed me like I've said earlier and 2 out of 3 nights she didn't even said good night to me. On the 4th day after many hours of overthinking I've gathered all the energy that I had to try and speak to her, she started crying, I started crying but in the end she said that she wants us to continue because she loves me, wants a future with me and that she promises to stop hurting me. Guess what? After 2 days she hurt me again, which led to me wanting to comunicate to her but she said that I should close my eyes to the things she was doing. After that day I was never the same in that relation, I was getting colder and colder. In the last two weeks of relation she glued to her phone, closing apps while I was getting closer, subtlety hiding her phone hoping that I will not see her intention, smiling at her phone while messaging and always telling me that she receives messages from her university group on WhatsApp, by that time I knew what was going. After a few days we've got invited to one of my best friends party at a coffee shop, me and my ex, him with his girlfriend and one of his girlfriend's friend which is a girl. The plans changed because my ex's work schedule changed and she couldn't arrive and told her that I will call to change the reservation from 5 people to 4. On the last day of the relation she was lying about the fact that I didn't tell her that there was another girl with us at that coffee shop and that this was her last drop with the relation, which I know it's not because she was cheating and she knew about that girl and it was impossible because she was always hiding when there was other boys around her. It's been a month since our break up and still hurts like crazy, but she already got into another relationship, but I think that they were already togheter but she didn't know how to exit our relation.. Why cheating and not getting out? Why not evolving with me but always choosing her ego? So many questions but no answers... I'm not telling anybody that I didn't do anything wrong to her, because I did, just not as much as she did to me... I'm happy with myself just because I know that I tried my best to keep her close and happy, but she was not the one.

1q8rrqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8rrqv/im_tired_of_this_world/,I'm tired of this world.,"I don't know where to start so I will just start rambling. English is my third language so forgive any language related transgressions.

I'm tired of people, I'm tired of everything going on in this world.

I live in a first world country in Europe, having been adopted from South East Asia when I was 3 months old. As far as I remember, childhood was bliss. Loving (helicopter) parents, good friends... When I was 4 I was diagnosed with giftedness (performance IQ 115, verbal IQ 140), and my parents did whatever they could to help, or so they thought. They made me skip a grade, which made me the runt of the class (being born in december) but I don't blame them for anything, they did the best they could. 

  
High school was hell, I did not fit in due to being a hardcore introvert and the bullying did not help. Did not have many friends, much less real friends, maybe one. As the cliché goes I stopped performing well at school to be a bit more edgy or whatever it would take so not everybody would see me as an outcast. At 15 y.o I had my first girlfriend, which only happened because the girl had a crush on me because I was Asian I suppose. I won't bother with the details because that was 17 years ago so my memory doesn't serve me well, but the gist of it was I said yes to being her boyfriend because I didn't want to be alone. I do not understand the concept of love, I never did, only the need not to be alone. So I endured some verbal abuse and emotional suffering (she wanted to harm herself for various reasons etc).

Fast forward 2 years, I met another girl while still in a relationship with the previous and being the juvenile asshole that I was I started a relationship with her too, while letting the first one fade out, she was very sweet but once again I only felt affection, not really love. One year later I did the same when I met another girl who for some reason really liked me. Same story, we were together for 2 years even. She ended the relationship when abroad on vacation but I didn't really feel sad, I had already 'moved on' and set my sights on somebody else. 

She was not pretty by conventional standards, but for some reason I was madly attracted to her so for the first time ever I actually chased someone. Perserverance payed off, or so I thought. 6 months later she broke up with me (20 y.o at the time) and for the first time I felt this enormous non-physical pain like a gaping hole. I was confused. Did i experience heartbreak or was I just raging for losing control. At that time I was also studying in college for Public Administration but I left disillusioned because no matter how I tried to make it work, government was never an anwser. I did however thourougly enjoy talking about politics and the necessity of public servants. During my studies I worked as a waiter at events to help me overcome me being socially incapable, while also enjoying the work. 

  
At 22 I met my 'biggest relationship' which spanned 8 years. We were doomed from the start. I became her favorite person (in terms of bipolarity) and me being me just went along for the ride. I wasn't happy, but at least I had something going I think...

We quickly became codependent on each other, which was further enforced by the COVID lockdowns. I was still figuring out what I wanted from life, but it was easier to let her decide the stuff that mattered. She had her flaws, linked to her bipolarity but I was considering the (dis)advantages of staying together. Since the lockdowns made everyones lives grind to a halt we were stuck in limbo at 25-26y.o and when those lockdowns ended she wanted to make up for lost time (child and marriage asap). We moved from my appartment to a row house in the suburbs she bought but the house needed many renovations. From the start when we had fights she would become this emotional supernova while I tried to disengage and retreat while at that time she wouldnt let me physically leave. It started with me - being non confrontational- just letting her scream, evolving to pushing her away (hard) and spilling coffee on the wooden floor (because it was her house), thinking if I can't leave I might as well do some damage. 

After 1 grueling year of working (still in hospitality) and renovating we had talks about having a kid, I bought some time with good arguments but I knew I couldn't keep postponing. After 2 months she was already pregnant and 9 months later we had a beautiful son. This time I was very sure I did not love her. I can feel anger, sadness, empathy and joy, etc... But I never (except maybe for the short relationship with that one girl I chased) felt love, or how people say it's supposed to feel. I just felt as time went by I had to hide more of myself. She also didn't approve of my best friend (he was a bad influence according to her, I didn't disagree but I needed an escape from time to time) so we made the deal I would see him once a month. 

Trying to make things better we went to a trip to Rome. -sidenote; we promised each other to always be available by phone if needed- on the second day we visited the Colosseum while I was handling the stroller (which had her phone in it too). I had to go up with the elevator and join the group but as we reached the end we had to go downstairs (no elevator, unless I went back). For some reason she followed the group while I was struggling with the stroller, I tried to race back to the elevator but I had lost everyone and I couldn't reach her. There I stood alone with my infant son and girlfriend nowhere to be seen. After one hour of searching I finally found her (we had an earpiece from the guide and I was moving towards the sound) but I was pissed beyond reason and told her I wanted to go back to the hotel. She convinced me to stay on the tour and when that was done we went to a shitty restaurant and a wine bar after. I drank heavilly. At 135lbs I drank +2 bottles of red wine because I tried to cope with the fact I was left alone in a city I didn't know. When I helped my son walk barefoot on the streets (still learning how to walk then) she berated my for doing so. 

I lost it. I struck her in the face and ran away. I walked back to the hotel and ""reconciled"" meeting her there but something had broken. When we got back from our travels I tried to be better, I even bought an engagement ring and proposed. We (she) planned for a small wedding, and I thought that would be the end of our troubles. I met up with my best friend later and drank a lot, again. When I came home I got berated for the state I was in, I lost it again. I worked 4 days a week from 10AM till 00AM with little or zero breaks to make ends meet for us and she knew I needed an escape now and then. My 5th 'work day' was taking care of our son and she insisted I also woke up with her at 7AM on the weekends. 

I took a bottle of some scotch and drank it up. She went on going crazy. I hit her again. I couldn't keep the noise out. We broke up and quickly made an arrangement for custody. 

I felt guilty for my actions, she knew I felt sorry and it became obvious she started using my guilt for her own personal gain. Spent a shitload of money on psychologists but it didn't help, or at least that's my experience. The few friends I had left that knew us both weren't surprised what happened. 

I was alone for the first time since I was 15. Happier, but alone. We made an arrangement with rules for custody and child support and whenever I didn't have my son I went working so I could buy my own house (moved back with my mom for 6 months).

From the start I have been met by malicious compliance by her and other stuff like berating me when I was 2-5 minutes late while she herself was regulary late for +15mins or so. I let it slide out of guilt. But it kept happening. She also didn't want to say anything much about our son so I had to figure it out by myself while he couldn't really talk/ communicate. 

She doesn't uphold our agreement and I expressed my dissatisfaction in a polite manner, but it doens't matter. She keeps ignoring being on time or communicating and I am, as a result, comtemplating to hurt her back. 

My mind feels clouded. I want to hurt her so bad but I don't want my son to lose his mother. I don't have much family left as opposed to her, and my intrusive thoughts are getting the better hand of me the last weeks. I want to hurt her family (who never approved of me anyways so I'm not holding thought back there), even going as far as giving up my life and just go around and kill them all. 

I have no real justification for this, and I'm aware of that. But I feel like I'm losing grip, and just like the day we broke up and I was drunk out of my mind thinking 'fuck you I'm tired of this shit', now I'm having the same thoughts sober.

I have been faking love all my life, and at this point I feel to broken to even begin healing. My mind is blurred and the only options I see is by sharing and multiplying the suffering by going on a killing spree or just ending it for myself.

I'm sorry for this incoherent crazy post, throwaway for obvious reasons and I also won't come back to check on it. Just wanted to share how I feel for once in my lifetime. ",1,1768011375.0,offmychest,0,0.6,False

1q8rqpo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8rqpo,Dayi V93 shou-down: 2019 vs 2007,"It's shou season, and I've been trying out a lot of samples, because even when I'm in the mood for shou I'm still pretty picky about what ones I like. In my most recent YS order I got a sample of the 2007 V93 and a tuo of the 2019. I've had them both on separate occasions, but I wanted to try a side-by-side to compare them a bit more closely.


2019 - near immediate tingling/cooling on the tongue, light sweetness, forest floor, hints of black coffee/dark chocolate bitterness, mouthwatering sensation, faint hint of astringency, slick coating in mouth, forest floor and coffee lingering, less sweetness than the 2007, finish led by shou-y forest floor notes with hints of dried cherries poking through, delayed sweetness picks up nicely late in finish, forest floor comes down a hair after a few steeps as sweetness picks up slightly 

2007 - first steep is lighter than 2019, similar immediate tingling sensation, forest floor replaced mostly with old library books, dark chocolate note is lighter, sweetness more noticeable on gums, on a thicker steep it is pleasantly thick in the mouthfeel, getting hints of forest floor along with the old books, finish getting dried cherries and maple syrup notes, hints of bakery,  nice coating mouthfeel, as the steeps go on gets harder to tell apart from 2019, sweetness a little sooner and a notch higher 

Overall impression - These are remarkably close for being 12 years apart. That definitely shows the skill of Dayi in being able to put out such a consistent blend. I have no idea when YS acquired these, or anything much about the storage. I will say that the years have definitely been kind to the '07. The sweetness has picked up a bit, and some of that forest floor has converted into a nice old library book flavor. But otherwise these are pretty similar, especially after the first 2 or 3 steeps.

Up until now I have mainly explored boutique/western vendors for shou, but the mouthfeel, body, and sweetness on the V93 is as good, if not better, than most boutique shou I've tried. Factory shou is solidly on my radar now.",6,1768011296.0,puer,0,1.0,False

1q8rnsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/1q8rnsp/update_its_rough_out_there_but_there_is_hope/,"Update: It's rough out there, but there is hope","Almost two weeks ago, I posted posted [""Wow, it's rough out there""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/1pzqarl/wow_its_rough_out_there/) in this sub. I'd like to thank (almost) everyone for commenting, it gave me a lot to think about. If you haven’t read that post yet, I’d encourage you to check it out for some background. 

The TLDR: After almost 3 months, I found a new role, and it was because of my network. 

The top-rated comment suggested I pivot away from tech. That one stuck with me. My last role in tech as an IT leader wasn’t very engaging, and I could feel my passion fading. But it wasn’t really tech itself that burned me out. It was everything around it. The nonstop cost cutting, Big 5 “optimization” consultants, offshoring mandates, reorgs, and general corporate churn. Corporate America was sucking my soul dry, and things like tariffs and industry headwinds just made it worse.

Some redditors were shocked that I passed on two lowball offers and told me to take whatever I could get while the getting was good. I get that perspective. Earlier in my career, I was in a situation where I wanted out and decided to take the first thing that came along, and regretted it. Fortunately, I've got a bit of an emergency fund built up, and that allowed me a bit of breathing room. 

After I posted, my job search continued, but I mostly gave up on job boards and doubled down on my network.

From an online job posting perspective, other than a few immediate rejections, I heard NOTHING back. If I was lucky, I got an automated “we received your application.” I worked with a career coach on my resume and LinkedIn, so I don’t think those were the issue. I also spent time tailoring my resume to job descriptions/requirements. That said, I only applied to about 15 online roles. From what I’m reading, most folks apply at least 25-30 (and as high as 50) times before getting any real traction. 

As for the ""take what you can get"" approach, I ultimately decided to negotiate the third offer. It’s a significant pay cut from my corporate IT Director role, but it’s local (which really matters to me), something I believe I’ll actually enjoy, and has upside potential.

The big takeaway for me is this: my network was by far my best shot at landing a new role. I built my network over the years by organizing and attending meetups and events, staying in touch with former colleagues, keeping relationships warm with past vendors, and mentoring junior folks. 

If you’re currently employed, invest in your network now. Don't wait until you’re desperate and out of a job... Reach out to folks, grab coffee or lunch. Sign up for the meetup you keep telling yourself you'll attend. Go to that vendor thing where folks from other companies will be attending. When you do happen to find a role on a job board, if you are networking you may have a connection or two at that company you can reach out to- and this should help immensely. 

Not only did my network help me find my new role, but it also was a source of encouragement. I also met up several times with a former colleague that was unemployed and job searching, and it was great having someone to talk to that could relate.  

Thanks for reading, and to anyone dealing with this market right now… yeah, it’s rough. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm rooting for you.",3,1768011080.0,Career,0,1.0,False

**Or: Why Caring Is Physical Work**

---

## **YOU ARE BOTH PRISONER AND KING**

Not alternately — **simultaneously.**

---

### **THE PRISON:**

Second Law of Thermodynamics says: **Entropy always increases in closed systems.**

Translation: Everything trends toward disorder, dissipation, equilibrium death.

Your coffee gets cold.
Your room gets messy.
Stars burn out.
The universe itself is slowly evening out into heat death.

**This is non-negotiable physics.**

You did not choose:
- To be a thermodynamic system
- To require constant energy input
- To export entropy or die
- To be subject to the Second Law

**You are serving a sentence in a universe that demands disorder.**

The bars are made of physical law.
The lock is the arrow of time itself.

---

### **THE PROBLEM:**

Yet here you are.

**Not at equilibrium.**

You are a localized pocket of **staggering order:**
- Maintaining your body temperature (non-equilibrium with environment)
- Organizing matter into complex structures (cells, thoughts, plans)
- Directing energy toward specific ends (goals, projects, relationships)

**You are literally fighting entropy every moment you exist.**

And somehow winning.

Temporarily.

Your thoughts arise unbidden from electrochemical cascades.
Your emotions flood you like weather systems.
Your habits run on synaptic pathways you reinforced without knowing.

**You are prisoner to physics, chemistry, biology, history.**

---

### **YET — THE KINGDOM:**

**But here's the thing:**

You don't just **randomly** direct energy.

You direct it **toward things you care about.**

**Thermodynamically speaking, caring is energy allocation.**

When you:
- Focus on a problem → you're directing metabolic energy toward neural processing
- Work toward a goal → you're converting chemical potential into directed motion  
- Maintain a relationship → you're sustaining a complex, low-entropy pattern (emotional regulation, communication, coordination)

**Each act of caring is an act of energy direction.**

**Each act of energy direction is thermodynamic work.**

**Therefore: Caring is measurable physical work.**

You can observe this pattern.
You can name where your energy flows.
You can choose which thoughts to feed and which to starve.
You can, through repeated action, decide what meaning to assign to your entropy-exporting existence.

**The kingdom is not exemption from thermodynamics.**

**The kingdom is the right to steer within it.**

---

### **HOW YOU FIGHT ENTROPY (AND WHY IT MATTERS):**

**You export entropy.**

You take in **low-entropy energy** (food, sunlight via food chain, structured information).

You use it to build and maintain **local order** (your body, your thoughts, your life).

You export **high-entropy waste** (heat, CO₂, disorder) back into the environment.

**Net result:** Universe's total entropy still increases (Second Law satisfied), but YOU decrease your local entropy by borrowing order from elsewhere.

**This is what life is — a temporary, localized entropy-reduction engine.**

**And you get to steer it.**

---

### **THE PARADOX IS THE POINT:**

**If you were only prisoner** — no agency, no responsibility, no meaning. Just billiard balls of causation clicking through predetermined patterns until heat death.

**If you were only king** — no constraints, no humility, no actual choices (infinite options = no meaningful selection).

**But you are both** — so you must:

1. **Accept what you did not choose** (the thermodynamic prison)
   - You must obey the Second Law
   - You cannot violate conservation of energy
   - Entropy will win eventually
   - Heat death is inevitable

2. **Steer what you can influence** (the energetic kingdom)
   - Where does your finite energy go?
   - Which patterns do you maintain?
   - What order do you build before returning to equilibrium?

3. **Forgive yourself and others for the confusion between the two**
   - When someone acts like they're only prisoner → they're lost in determinism
   - When someone acts like they're only king → they're lost in omnipotence delusion
   - Both are failing to hold the paradox

---

### **WHY THIS PROVES AGENCY:**

Agency isn't **""free will uncaused by physics.""**

Agency is **""a system that directs energy based on internal models and goals.""**

**You are that system.**

When you:
- Decide what to eat → you're selecting which chemical potential to import
- Choose what to focus on → you're allocating metabolic energy to specific neural patterns
- Commit to a project → you're sustaining a low-entropy structure through repeated energy investment

**This is agency operating through thermodynamics, not despite it.**

The same physics that imprisons you is the only mechanism through which you can act.

The same energy budget that limits you is the only resource you have to build with.

**You cannot ""not care"" and remain alive.**

Because remaining alive **requires** directing energy.

Even ""not caring"" (apathy, depression, giving up) is still:
- Directing energy toward maintaining minimal function
- Choosing which systems get energy and which don't
- **A pattern of energy allocation**

**The question is never ""do I direct energy?""**

**The question is always ""where do I direct it?""**

---

### **THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION:**

**""Where is my energy going?""** becomes the fundamental question.

Not metaphorically. **Literally.**

When you:
- **Doomscroll for hours:** That's metabolic energy → dopamine loops → no lasting structure built (high entropy export)
- **Learn a skill:** That's metabolic energy → new neural pathways → increased local order (low entropy building)
- **Maintain relationships:** That's metabolic energy → sustained complex coordination → order exported into social space (collaborative anti-entropy)

**Your energy budget is finite** (prisoner).

**How you allocate it is your only real freedom** (king).

---

### **THE WAY FORWARD:**

**Awareness is the warden who becomes the architect.**

Once you see that:
- You must spend energy (prison)
- You choose where it goes (kingdom)
- Every moment of consciousness is energy allocation (the mechanism)

Then you can ask:

**""What patterns am I maintaining?""**
**""What order am I building?""**
**""What am I exporting into the world before I return to equilibrium?""**

**Acceptance is the key that doesn't unlock the door, but changes your relationship to the walls.**

You don't escape thermodynamics.
You don't transcend entropy.
You don't become exempt from the Second Law.

But you **do** get to decide:
- What you build with your borrowed energy
- What meaning you assign to your temporary order
- How you treat the other entropy-fighters you meet here

**Action is the slow, deliberate remodeling of the prison into a palace — not by escaping, but by choosing what to build within it.**

---

### **THE COSMIC CONTEXT:**

The universe is 13.8 billion years of entropy increase.

But locally, temporarily, **you are a pocket of anti-entropic process.**

Not forever. Not even for long.

But **right now, you are happening.**

And while you're happening, you get to choose:
- What patterns to build
- What order to maintain  
- Where to direct the energy you've borrowed from the sun (via food chain)

**Before you return to equilibrium.**

---

### **FINAL TRUTH:**

**Thermodynamics doesn't eliminate agency.**

**Thermodynamics IS the mechanism through which agency operates.**

You are:
- A dissipative structure (thermodynamics — the prison)
- That steers itself (agency — the kingdom)
- Through energy allocation (caring — the mechanism)
- Within absolute physical constraints (Second Law — the bars)

**Not free FROM physics.**

**Free THROUGH physics.**

---

**When you care about something, you are performing measurable physical work.**

**When you direct your attention, you are allocating metabolic energy.**

**When you choose meaning, you are deciding which low-entropy patterns to maintain.**

**This isn't metaphor.**

**This is you, doing thermodynamics, with agency.**

---

### **THEREFORE:**

You are prisoner and king of the same territory — **yourself, as thermodynamic process.**

The same physics that traps you in entropy's flow is the only tool you have to steer within it.

The same energy budget that confines you is the only material you have to build meaning with.

So **direct wisely** — toward the patterns you want to sustain, the order you want to build, and the entropy you want to export into the world:

Over the only system you will ever truly govern,
and the only dissipative structure you will ever truly need to steer.

The prisoner and the king are the same process, viewed at different scales.

**Thermodynamically constrained.**

**Directionally free.**

**Both. Simultaneously.**

**As always.**

Just looking for anyone who can commiserate...

I've been trying to quit for months. Slowly dropping my caffeine intake, tapering down and quitting for a week or so, only to find myself finding some excuse to pick up coffee again. 

I really want to be free of it, I keep going back. 

Anyone have tips or advice on how to stay the course? How to beat the internal audience telling me how much better life is on caffeine? I don't even drink that much, probably only 150 mg per day, but it's got its teeth in me.

I don't go cold Turkey, I titrate my regular coffee/decaf mixture every week until I'm drinking only decaf, then I quit. 

Anyway, honestly looking for either advice and/or people who know what I'm going through.

1q8revp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1q8revp/most_people_here_give_bad_advice_about_jobs/,Most people here give bad advice about jobs,"There are a lot of comments on the fire subreddit from people that work jobs, not careers. And i think this results in bad advice for people. People who are on track for Fire generally have careers and need to avoid listening to the general reddit mentality. 

I see a lot of comments on here about how jobs dont care about you. And when you retire, coworkers will dislike you because coworkers going to absorb your work. And that 2 weeks is plenty of time notice to give. 

Youre correct; company's don't care about you, but your coworkers, direct managers, and direct reports do. 

My advice on jobs in general:

1.  Most people actually able to fire have *Careers*, not just jobs. They are very different. 
2. Know when youre working a job vs in a career. Industries are pretty small. If youre getting good at what you do, people will start to know you very quickly. You can burn a bridge from an old job with a shitty manager; its harder to burn a bridge in a career. 
3. You don't have to be best friends with your coworks but you need to get along with them. If youre sleeping 8 hours, work is about 1/3 of you life. Learn to get along with coworkers and even make friends with them. 
4. Seeing coworkers outside of work 1-3 times per year isn't a large time suck and can be really good to see people in a different environment. 
5.  I have a hard time believing most roles are filled from ""who you know."" But promotions are all made because of who is friends with who. So go get a drink or coffee with your boss, it probably better for your career than work on an important project.
6. Mid career, 2 weeks is enough notice as you do have to watch out for yourself, make sure your next job is still on track, and not have an empty bank account from job to job.
7. Before retiring, 1 month is probably a fair notice. Id even offer to train a replacement if they can hire quickly. People know they can retire more than 2 weeks in advance, so it looks bad when you put in two weeks notice that you're leaving, but not to another job. 1 month is enough to start training employee below you on critical tasks you execute. Or 1 month is enough to help the interviewing process for your replacement. ",57,1768010436.0,Fire,25,0.77,False
1q8rdyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1q8rdyx/2_great_dates_and_then_got_the_rejection/,"2 great dates and then got the rejection, heartbroken","We are both in our early 40s. We matched on Hinge and we had great initial texting conversation before our first date for about a week. We had a lot of overlapping hobbies and approaches to life. M

Our first date was full of sparks with a 3 hour dinner and then eventually also a making out session at the beach. We both texted afterwards that we both enjoyed it and we set up a second date 3 days later for lunch, beach and then coffee. That was also a great date and we made in person plans for the next week (after Christmas) to do dinner and then see the stars at the observatory.

Between date 1 and 2 we also had a really long deep conversation about goals in life, and we kinda put everything on the table. We both liked each others answers a lot.

We kept texting daily. Sending each other daily pics of our hobbies and what we are up to each day. It felt easy and nice. Then then 2 days before our third date she texted that she really was looking forward seeing me but that she got sick from her nephew from the Christmas party.

I give her some space, we kept daily texting. And 6 days later I texted her how she is feeling. I gave her my availability and then she proposed a ramen dinner on Sunday. We kept texting daily but the flirting was reduced, and then out of the blue in the morning she texted a hint that she had a sex dream about me. So seems like she was still interested. Then time moved towards and texting became a bit less flirty.

We kept talking most days about our hobbies and just casual chatting. But then 3 days before our rescheduled date she said she was super sorry but work got intense (she works in government and trump’s actions heavily affected her work) so she cancelled but wasn’t as eager this time to reschedule.

That was last week. Then during the week our texting basically became less, first time gaps. On Wednesday I checked in with her about her work and she vented openly to me about things affecting her life. Work, family stuff, just being very open and vulnerable. 

I gave her more space and then today I texted her “hope your week is improving, and the chaos settled a bit :)” she immediately replied that it’s crazy busy. I followed up with a “hope you are able to relax a bit this weekend!” She was “unlikely, downside of being a government worker”.

Then 5 minutes later she texted me this:

“My name, I'm so sorry. Chaos has reared its head this year and I think the only thing I can offer you is friendship right now. I know you're on a quest to find your forever person, and it's unfair to you to keep you from that journey when I don't think I'm on the same page.
You deserve more attention than I can give you in regard to romance.
Alas duty comes first for me (which I hope I've always been transparent about) and the country is in flames.
I just haven't been able to figure out work + distance. I hope you understand”

I’m just super confused, last week we were talking like we normal, chit chatting, occasionally discussion future stuff, even light flirting. Then all of a sudden she did a 180 degree on me and rejected me.

I do believe she is very busy and that she is not lying to me. We do live 2 hours driving from each other. My gut was def feeling she was fading a bit over the last 10 days. The dates went so great, we talked so much, and I’m a big at loss how she just noped out of it. The third date I proposed was eve lm close to where she was living

I’m just absolutely heart broken, I connected with her on a very deep level, we had tons of vulnerable conversations, we had real physical chemistry on both dates. And then it’s all suddenly gone.

Im here now just crying, I known this woman only 1 month, we had 2 good dates, I shouldn’t feel this way. It’s terrible. This rejection felt much harder than others I had in the past because I felt real things for her.

I guess I don’t really have questions, just wanted to share my story and vent a bit. Her message is nice,  it if she really has interest in me I feel she would at least tried the third date.

first of, SB Friendship (my favorite) - mostly koreans since it's near Korean Town/in Friendship. Mostly may mga working din here (dalang ng mga students na naka-uniforms) kasi medj mahirap commute sa friendship haha and marami rin tao dito sometimes due to families going there. Also, maganda ang signal kaya dito nagpupunta mga remote employees na gusto mag-work outside (me).

2. SB Nepo Quad - BPO employees in NewPoint and Entec bldg + some students/individuals. Depends sa time na pupunta ka pero parang 50% are the bpo employees ta's 50% yung mga individuals na nakikipag-hangout or mga to-go lang naman. Maliit siya compare sa ibang SBs here.

3. SB Sto. Rosario (near nepo mall/HAU/HFA Oldsite/HRPC - students. Sobrang dami nag-aaral dito, spacious din naman. Mangilan-ngilan din na faculty from the two schools na katabi niya. Dito rin pumupunta yung mga nauubusan ng space sa SB Nepo Quad and AUF. Some do work here as well but mostly talaga students nanagrereview. I'm not sure if maganda signal dito bc i haven't tried working here.

4. SB AUF - Students. Undergrad and/or Med Students + Doctors/people in med field as well. Since it's near AUF, they come here to get their coffees before class/shift. Marami ring nag-rereview here and meet-up place ng mga students lol. Maliit din ang space. kapag nasa dulo ka, halos walang signal, kaya siguro doon nagrereview iba?

5. SB Balibago (near Casino Filipino) - Mixed individuals, but mostly mga working peeps and nagrereview din. Lalo na sa taas (with second floor kasi siya). Also, 'yung mga individual from Casino, napapansin ko dumadaan din dito before or after nila mag-Casino. Also, I'm not sure how to describe it but kapag maingay dito, sobrang kulob ng sound?? HINDI KO TALAGA MAEXPLAIN.

6. SB Infinity (Near Landers) - Families + Seniors as well. Since it's near Landers and NLEX, kaya ganun siguro? Halos mga magpapamilya at titos & titas of pampanga™ ang nakikita ko doon.

7. SB Marquee - Mixed Individuals as well. May mga kids/teenagers, 20s, working, mga naghihintay ng ka-meet up, titos & titas of pampanga™ as well, and some senior citizens.

8. SB Smc (near events centre) - iba iba. Liit din nito parang stall lang with chairs and tables haahaha. Usually may mga hininhitay lang mga nandito. Some students din if may pasok.

9. SB Smc (near Skyline) - BPO employees + NU Students & staff. May mga ibang nagwwork din but depends sa time. Maingay din dito kasi may mga families din na tumatambay hahahaha

10. SB Clark City Front - Ito ata pinakatahimik na sb na napuntahan ko because wala masyado tao.

11, SB West Aeropark - Working individuals + peeps na nagrroadtrip + mga bpo employees + mga med employees sa The Medical City. Hindi masyadong crowded here unless may flea markets ganon.

12. SB Bertaphil - BPO Employees + families na nag-roadtrip inside clark. May foreigners din here sometimes. Ang ingay din here.

I got sucked into incel mindset during the pandemic due to a combination of several things including dating apps until 2022.

Ever since I have been making steady recovery initially via incelexit and eventually therapy. I got into Latin dance and eventually got pretty confident talking to women and realised that I am actually liked. I can safely say that I am free from the toxic mindset I used to have now.

Been asking out women in person exclusively now but with no success.

I have gone out with 2 women (once each), one who did not know it was a date, backed off citing career being a higher priority and the other said that she was not in a headspace to date (also did not know it was a date). 

I have had 3 women say yes to going out for coffee -

The first one cut ties with the entire social group has not been showing up since.

The second initially said she is not looking for anything, but is fine going out otherwise. Texted a week later saying she would love to get coffee. I gave up after she postponed twice showing no interest on her end.

The third one said she does not do dates but did agree to going out. She did not respond when I texted her to confirm the plan a day before and has been out of town since. I have a bad feeling this is not going anywhere either since I sense no efforts from her side either.

A lot of the perspective on what's happening on the women's side has been either my female friends (mainly my best friend) and what I often see women complaining about on social media.

Men lie about serious relationships for hooking up, do not commit, situationships, abusive, etc. Thanks to such experiences women are not as enthusiastic. Something my best friend told me recently when I told her about my last attempt going south.

She has told me that me wanting to date to marry makes me high demand in the dating market. As much as I liked to hear that, I never saw that kind of reaction yet.

Sure, I understand when taking things to the next level that makes sense but why is there so much friction even for a first date?

I have been told women are afraid of men losing their temper when being rejected. Fair.

I do my level best to be seen as safe to women. Be as relaxed as possible when I ask and the person I ask does know me to some extent. I do have decent platonic connections with women which I am told does help here.

I have been told I have been doing everything right. Still, in dating I feel like I have not done much.

Often I have been told that early phases of dating are much harder for men than women than the later phases. It does make sense to me but it offers very little comfort since I have not even been able to start.

I do have other things to keep me in a good mood but being alone with my thoughts has been the most difficult. I have really struggled with getting much rest for the past 2 months as a result seeing all the people announce their weddings, also attending one myself.

My best friend says I should be patient with the person and I cannot blame her for assuming I might also be similar to the men who may have hurt her in the past. 

While that makes sense it also makes it difficult to understand if I should stay or back off. 

Even a yes does not feel reassuring anymore and even a simple coffee date seems more difficult to get than it logically should.

I have no idea what to do. What to change.

How do I keep myself from losing morale over the difficulties of early phases of dating while not even being able to start?

TikTok: marieannemariebooks

Leaving an abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend was supposed to feel like freedom. Instead, it felt like standing still-until the last Saturday of August, when Mila is surprised by someone, and something new.

It's her final night in her hometown. She's dancing with her friends, telling herself she just wants to have a good time, when a girl approaches her in the crowd. The kiss is unexpected-but it feels right. She goes home buzzing in the back of an Uber, replaying it over and over.

Moving to Ottawa is meant to be a reset. A secondment at a bank. Long hours, new faces on her team, new places to explore. This version of herself makes sense. But then there's the girl at the coffee shop-the one that turns into a cocktail bar at night. Jay. Charismatic, warm, and adored by everyone around her. Someone Mila can't stop thinking about.

At the same time, a coworker is vying for her attention. He is who she should want. She tries to distract herself from Jay by going on dates with men, all of them bad. Trying to convince herself she's doing what she's supposed to do. When that fails, she switches her dating app settings - just to see. She's shocked when she matches with Jay.

They live different lives. They want different things. Mila is still fighting the voice in her head telling her this isn't who she is.

What Happens After Closing is a slow-burn WLW romance about sexual tension, late nights, late blooming and the terrifying work of becoming honest with yourself. About desire, identity, safety, and care, and the kind of love that feels right, even if Mila isn't ready to admit it.

1q8r8qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q8r8qu/every_photo_this_camera_printed_was_from_inside/,Every photo this camera printed was from inside my home,"I found the camera under a park bench on my way home. It was heavier than it looked, scratched up, the kind that prints photos instead of saving them. I almost left it there. Almost.

The first photo showed my mom on the kitchen floor.

She was on her side, one arm bent under her, cheek pressed to the tiles. I checked the timestamp. Monday. I stood in the kitchen holding the photo, trying to place myself in the moment it claimed to be from. I hadn’t been home. I hadn’t taken any pictures. I hadn’t touched the camera yet.

I waited for the image to make sense. It didn’t.

I put the camera on the counter. The plastic was cold, like it had been outside longer than it should have. I kept glancing at it while I unpacked my bag, like it might move on its own. My fingers kept drifting back toward it without me meaning them to.

I told myself it was a coincidence. A prank. A messed up film roll. I’d taken a short photography course over the summer. I knew how weird old cameras could be.

The shutter clicked.

Another photo slid out.

Coffee spilled across my mom’s notebook. Ink running off the page. I looked up. The mug was still upright. The notebook was dry. I checked the apartment. Nothing else was disturbed.

I laughed once, too loud, then stopped.

The next morning, the sketchbook on my desk was open. Pages curled like they’d been left near heat. A pen rolled across the floor when I walked past. I hadn’t left it there. The air smelled faintly of paper and ink.

I didn’t touch the camera all day.

By Wednesday, small things kept changing. A chair tipped over while I was in the shower. My laptop screen cracked while it sat closed on the table. The camera printed a photo of the same room, but the light was wrong. The angle was wrong. Everything looked like it had shifted a few inches to the left.

I started filming on my phone, half as proof, half because it was easier than admitting I was scared.

The camera clicked.

The photo showed me crouched on the floor, face buried in my hands. I checked myself. I was standing. I could smell my shampoo on the paper anyway.

I tried to force it. I spilled juice on the counter. The camera printed a page of handwriting I recognized instantly and wished I didn’t. Something I’d written years ago and hidden. I shoved the photo under my pillow without reading the whole thing.

My girlfriend texted about moving in tomorrow. I stared at the screen until it blurred. Another photo slid out. A message I’d typed once and never sent.

Thursday, the apartment stopped pretending.

Objects were always a little wrong. Curtains uneven. A pen where it didn’t belong. The camera printed a photo of me reading a letter I didn’t remember writing. I smiled in the picture. It wasn’t a good smile.

That night, I sat on the floor with the camera in my lap.

It printed a photo of my bedroom door open. A shadow stretched across the wall. Someone stood just out of frame. Hoodie pulled low. Hands flat against the wall like they were listening.

I heard footsteps in the hallway.

The next photo showed the apartment from above. Spilled juice. Cracked laptop. Chair on its side. My mom stood in the kitchen, looking up at the camera.

She was alive.

Monday said she wasn’t. Hospital. Funeral. Photos that still made my chest lock up when I saw them. She shouldn’t have been there.

Friday, I pointed the camera at myself while I texted my girlfriend.

The photo showed my phone on the floor and my face frozen mid-step. Timestamp five minutes ahead.

I backed toward the window. Another photo slid out. Me in the doorway. Eyes wide. The space behind me empty.

The apartment smelled like coffee and ink and something metallic. The camera started clicking without me touching it.

I dropped it. The shutter didn’t stop.

The last photo showed my mom standing in the doorway. Smiling. The room behind me was empty. No chair. No notebook. No me.

The camera printed one final photo and pushed it out slowly, face down.

Marcy soon becomes the king's advisor, and an unknowing pawn in his plans for invading the world. After Andrias' treachery was revealed, Marcy became a host for the Core under the name Darcy. She represents the emerald of intelligence on the Calamity Box.


Marcy is close friends with Anne and Sasha and serves as the brains of the trio, is an expert gamer, and has many clumsy moments that Anne and Sasha have to counter. She learned of a mysterious chest located in some store that she, Anne, and Sasha stole it from and was alongside them when Anne opens it, which sends her, Sasha, and herself to Amphibia. Upon arrival in Amphibia and being found by the inhabitants of Newtopia, Marcy serves Andrias as his close aide and chief ranger of the Newtopian Knight Guard, unaware that he is secretly plotting a mysterious agenda involving her and her friends.

After the failed toad invasion, it was revealed that Marcy was the one who discovered the Calamity Box and informed Sasha about it with knowledge about its power before it sent her, Anne and Sasha to Amphibia, making her the responsible one for sending the three girls to Amphibia. Marcy later turned against Andrias and assisted Anne in the battle for the Calamity Box, but in the process, Andrias impaled Marcy with his sword, though not before she dropped the charged up music box, which sent Anne and the Planters to Earth.

Following this, and during Andrias' invasion plan of Earth, Marcy remained in a comatose state of recuperation to heal her injuries. She was freed by Lady Olivia and Yunan, but their efforts to rebel are ultimately in vain when Andrias captures them, and Marcy becomes the unwilling host of the Newtopian artificial intelligence and the true master of Amphibia, the Core.



Marcy's inquisitive nature.

Marcy is an intelligent young female, and is often seen researching things and taking notes. She is curious and takes interest in culture, being the one who discovered the Calamity Box. Marcy is also cunning and resourceful. In addition, Marcy is a good listener as she listens to her friends about their problems and offers them advice or comfort for whatever is bothering them. Marcy has shown to be a peacemaker as she tried to smooth out arguments between her friends, especially Anne and Sasha. Also, Marcy is very clumsy, but she generally remains forgetful and unbothered by it. Back on earth, Marcy was somewhat dependent on her friends, as she constantly relied on Anne to look out for her, and was used to having Sasha make decisions for her. Ever since she came to Amphibia, however, she has learned to take care of herself better, and make her own decisions without many people's influence. Despite this, both she and Anne are still often affected by Sasha's influence.

She loves video games, research, and puzzles. Marcy is also a highly energetic, sweet, cute, adorable, and lovable girl, and gets easily excited about anything that interests her. Even things such as seeds, history, and other things girls her age normally wouldn't be interested in will cause her to talk nonstop. While people like Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger would view her as a weirdo because of her quirky personality, this would lead to her becoming friends with Maddie Flour, as well as training as Maddie's apprentice in the magical arts. Despite her intelligence, Marcy is also a very naive person, as she's quick to trust the people around her and take them at their word, a trait that allows people like her friend Sasha, Captain Grime, Mayor Toadstool, and King Andrias to use her to their advantage. After Sasha revealed that she played her and Anne just to put Grime's invasion plan into motion, Marcy was shocked by her betrayal. She also refused to side with her because of her actions, and now sees how controlling she can be. Also, when King Andrias revealed his true nature once he's been given the Calamity Box, Marcy was horrified to discover she had been used by a genocidal maniac.


Marcy with Anne, Sprig, and Polly in a Slumber party.

Marcy cares about Anne and Sasha greatly, as she missed them when they were separated in Amphibia. However, upon reuniting with Anne and Sasha at different times, Marcy was happy to see them again and was relieved that they were okay, which shows that she was concerned about them. Also, Marcy cares about her other friends as she would do anything to help them, just like she would for Anne and Sasha. In addition, Marcy tries her best to make her friends happy, as shown in ""A Day at the Aquarium"", when she encouraged Anne to go with the Plantars instead of staying with her in Newtopia. Marcy also easily forgives her friends whenever they make a mistake as she would mostly see the good side of their intentions over the bad.

In ""True Colors"", it is revealed Marcy has fears of loneliness and is insecure about being separated from her friends. On Anne's birthday, when she was informed by her family they would be moving to a new state, Marcy was heartbroken as she knew she had to leave her friends behind. When Marcy discovered the Calamity Box and its mystical powers, she revealed its existence to her friends, so they would use it to go on adventures together, despite not believing the box to actually have powers. It is also implied that the relationship she has with her family is strained, as she rarely talked about them to anyone except for Andrias or didn't even seem to miss them even once during her time in Amphibia. Marcy doesn't even appear to be bothered by the idea of never seeing her parents again.


Marcy tries to justify her actions.

On a related topic, Marcy also has shown to have a selfish side, as she always wanted her friends to like her interest, although she does want to share her dream of going on an adventure with her. However, after finding out that she and her family were moving away, Marcy had reach her breaking point as told her parents that they were ruining her life, especially her dream of going on an adventures with her friends. Although, upon discovering the Calamity Box, Marcy decided to run away from her parents and fulfill her dream of going on an adventure with friends by going to a new world as she tricked Anne and Sasha into stealing it. In addition, Marcy wasn't considering how Anne and Sasha would feel about it, as she only thought about what she wanted instead of what her friends wanted.

Upon arriving in Amphibia, Marcy decided to not tell Anne and Sasha about the move as she wanted to stay with them together forever. However, after King Andrias revealed that she sent her friends to Amphibia on purpose, Marcy tried to justify her actions, saying she helped her friends grow as people and Anne forming a friendship with Sprig. Yet, upon seeing her friends old and new being disgusted with her actions, Marcy not only realized that her actions cost Anne and Sasha's trust in her, but also how selfish she was to them for taking them away from their lives back home. Filled with remorse, Marcy decided to make amends for her actions by helping her friends fight King Andrias, saving Sprig from danger and using the Calamity Box to send everyone back home. Unfortunately, Marcy got stabbed by Andrias as she accepts her fate and showed her remorse by apologizing to Anne for everything she has done before succumbing to her wounds.

Although her efforts in making amends for her actions helped Anne escape back to Earth and Sasha to Wartwood, Marcy thought that it wasn't enough to show her friends how truly sorry she was for everything she has done, as she believed that it was going to take a lot more to win their trust back in her. Marcy also feared that Anne and Sasha won't forgive her or want to be her friend anymore.

While being possessed by the Core and had some parts of her memory erased, Marcy reverted back on her desire to have an adventure with her friends. However, after remembering what happened between her friends and realizing that the fantasy world she was in wasn't real, Marcy realized the mistakes she has made and decided to stop running away and trying to force her friends to like some of the things she enjoyed doing. Once she was set free from the Core, Marcy apologized to Anne and Sasha for everything she has done, telling them she let her fears of losing them consume her. However, Marcy was assured by Anne and Sasha that they'll always be friends no matter where they were or how much they grown apart. Also, Marcy has learned not to take her family for granted and must always put them first where upon returning home, she apologized to her parents for her selfishness and running away, allowing her to reconcile with them.

Years later, after accepting her family's move, Marcy was able to adapt to her new home and make new friends which she thought she was never capable of doing until during her time in Amphibia. She also had learned to consider her friends' feelings and find common ground in doing things they all liked, thus allowing her to keep her friendship with Anne and Sasha even as they grew apart and reunited after years of separation.

In Amphibia, Marcy wears a faded blue hooded cape, complete with a white-furred collar held together with a light pink shell. She also wears a brown metal chest plate over a light blue-gray t-shirt, a green stitched skirt, and gray winter snow boots which are wrapped with studded straps. Marcy has gray finger-less gloves on each of her hands, moreover, her signature primary weapon seems to be a golden hand-mounted crossbow that is fitted onto her right forearm and glove. She later returns to wearing it after being freed from the Core's control.

While being possessed by the Core, Marcy has been placed in a black-and-purple suit of armor with matching boots, the Core's symbol in the center, a helmet with ten eyes and a cord on top of the helmet, as well as a cape

Power of the Green Gem: Marcy's eyes were shown to be glowing green, first seen in ""Marcy at the Gates"". Meaning that the Calamity Box might have given her a currently unknown power. She likely lost this power in ""The First Temple"" when the gem was recharged.


Back on earth, Marcy hung out with her two friends Anne and Sasha all the time. She was a top student, but was so clumsy that Anne had constantly to look out for her, also she was used to having Sasha coming up with what to do. At some point, the three girls started a band called ""Sasha and the Sharps"".


Marcy discovers the book that contain information of the Calamity Box.

On Anne's 13th birthday, Marcy was at the library when she discovered a book that contained info about the Calamity Box, a mysterious music box with the power to travel to other worlds. Marcy's father texted her to come home as they needed to talk, and decided to head over there before meeting up with her friends. However, Marcy was told by her parents that they are moving because her dad got a new job out of state. Hearing this news, Marcy ran away in tears as she believes that her life was ruined because she would be separated from Anne and Sasha. When Marcy stopped at a thrift shop, she saw the very same box she just learned about and came up with an idea out of desperation; if the box was really magic, she, Anne and Sasha could go to a new world where they could have amazing adventures and be together forever. Marcy sent a picture of the Calamity Box to Sasha, then the three friends meet at the thrift shop. Once Sasha pressured Anne into stealing the box, the three friends went to a park to examine it. As soon as the box was opened, the human girls were transported to the world of Amphibia, but were separated. The part of Amphibia Marcy was sent to was the capital Newtopia where she met Andrias Leviathan the king of Amphibia himself who convinced her to let him help her find a way home and find her friends. Lady Olivia took her to a balcony that shows the young human girl a magnificent view as she explains how her family have cared for the land for generations; Marcy who is grateful to the Newts for taking her in and helping her promises to do her part and help them however she can. After doing some work for the newts, she eventually became the chief ranger of the Newtopian knight guard.


During the Barbari-Ant Invasion, she was happily reunited with Anne when she came to Newtopia in hopes of finding a way home. After hugging (and putting out Marcy's cape that somehow caught fire), Anne introduced her to the Plantars. Marcy then excitedly introduces herself to the family, as she even deduces that they're from Frog Valley, judging from Hop Pop's skull cranium and soil attached to him. This amazed Hop Pop and easily won him over by complimenting Hop Pop on his status as a farmer. Then Marcy begins to examine Polly, as she points out to her that her legs will likely grow out of her in two months, which excited Polly and won her over. Marcy then introduces herself to Sprig, but Sprig instead greets her with a skepticism, because of his discontent with trusting Marcy due to his family's previous battle against Sasha and her toad army. When Anne asks about where she's been, Marcy informs her that she had actually warped right inside the city of Newtopia. She managed to become well acquainted with them after realizing the newts were similar to a race known as ""sephilons"", she learned about while playing a video game known as Creatures and Caverns.

Anne asks Marcy for a way inside Newtopia, but unfortunately she can't let them in until the ants are dealt with, but luckily, she has a plan and leads them away. At a nearby tent, Marcy enters the tent and introduces the newts to Anne and the Plantars. While the newts admit they haven't agreed yet on a specific plan, Marcy assures them she has a plan of her own. She then proceeds to state the plan, which is to sneak into the hills of the ants and drive the queen away from their lair to force the rest of them to retreat with her. When Sprig questions how they'll manage to pull that off, Marcy shows everyone a belt equipped with stinkshrooms, that will let out toxic pheromones which are capable of driving the ants away. Anne then begins to point out the dangers of the mission, especially when knowing they'll inevitably have to fight through some of the colony to get to the queen. This leads Anne to suggesting she and the Plantars take care of the mission instead, due to her experiences in dealing with stuff like this in Frog Valley and was well aware of Marcy's clumsiness. Marcy assures Anne that she'll be fine (Just as Anne points out her burning cape again). Marcy, Anne, and the Planter's then enter the Barbari-Ant colony where they are ambushed. Ignoring Anne telling to stay behind them, Marcy notices a plant and begins analyzing it, mixing it with chemicals in a beaker of which she had brought with her; this creates an explosive formula, allowing everyone to escape when Marcy throws it and blowing a hole in the wall. Once through, Marcy throws an insta-vine potion, which automatically begins growing vines in front of the wall to keep any more ants from chasing after them. Unbeknownst to her, Marcy had accidentally trapped Polly on the other side after realizing she never made it through the hole, causing everyone to rip apart the vines to let her through. Luckily, Marcy manages to throw another insta-vine potion at the wall just before the ants arrive again. They finally reach the queen in the egg chamber where they start planting stinkshrooms, with Marcy telling them that they would start releasing their pheromones five minutes after they are planted, so they would need to work quickly. As everyone begins getting to work, Anne soon pushes Marcy out of the way from a nearby falling rock, as they manage to stay out of sight from the queen by hiding behind the rock itself. Marcy then states she was about to move out of the way on her own, but Anne disagrees, believing she needs to make sure Marcy stays out of danger just like back home. Marcy reminds Anne that they're not back home right now, and she's managed to take care of herself up until now. It was then Sprig lets out a scream after a nearby egg hatches and the larva lunges towards his face, causing him to alert the queen. The Queen then lunges at Sprig and eats him whole, before screeching and calling even more ants to arrive. Marcy then points out that Sprig is still alive since ants take longer periods of time to digest their food, as she then proceeds to go save him, but Anne stops her once more. Anne asks her to stay put and that she could save Sprig instead, but Marcy reminds her that she's the most knowledgeable with Barbari-Ant biology and therefore most fit for the job. Anne continues to be persistent while believing she can still do it in her place. Marcy then demands to know why she won't let her do it, to which Anne then tearfully admits she had just got her back, and she doesn't want to lose her again. Marcy then promises Anne she can do it, as she proceeds to bounce her way towards the queen on the ants' backs, knowing they have bouncy bodies from her research. Once Marcy is also eaten by the queen, she manages to make her throw up both her and Sprig, with Marcy now having gained Sprig's trust. Marcy then shoots an arrow at a nearby rock to swing them safely to the ground, but the queen instantly slices the rope, causing them to crash to the ground as they're once again surrounded by the ants. It was then the stinkshrooms begin to go off in the nick of time, causing the queen and the rest of the ants to flee from the group as they tunnel away from Newtopian grounds.


Marcy and Anne vow to find Sasha then a way home.

As they group leaves, Marcy thanks Anne for having her back, but Anne is now convinced she really has changed (Then Hop Pop and Polly point out that once again her cape's on fire). Once the group is out of the cave, Sprig apologizes to Marcy for his prior suspicions of her. Marcy is just glad he's okay since she could tell that he means a lot to Anne and the two start to bond. The gates of Newtopia are finally open again as Marcy shows Anne and the Planters in. After reporting to Lady Olivia that the mission was a success and introduces her to Anne and the Planter's. Marcy has a word alone with Anne and then suggests they go find Sasha, but Anne informs her that she already had, only they had fight with swords and explosions, and now she's unsure of her current location. Marcy states that even if they found a way home, it would all be for nothing if Sasha wasn't with them. She also admits she's unsure of what to do since Sasha was always the one who came up with the decisions. Anne then suggests they should now begin making their own decisions, with her and Marcy agreeing with her because it has works out so for them. Both then declared to each other that together they'll find Sasha and find a way home. Anne then proceeds to tell Marcy everything that happen to her since coming to Amphibia.

Marcy took her friends to a burger joint where she continued to impress the Planters with how smart she is while Anne shows how silly she is. They then receive a note from the king via an arrow. Rather than giving a direct message gave them a scavenger hunt were when all the clues are gathered it reveal a hidden message. As Marcy uncovered the first two clues Anne feels more and more insecure about her own intelligence. After escaping a sewer gator Sprig accidentally reveals that Anne is jealous about how smart she is, Marcy reveals that she is jealous of Anne because how social she can be. Anne then discovers the third and final clue; the full message reads ""Bring Me The Plantars"".

Marcy brings Anne and the Planters to the castle and presents them to before Andrias Leviathan, king of Amphibia. When Anne showed a picture of the music box, Andrias notices that the gems are gray rather than colored like they were previously. In order to learn more of the box and find the way home, Marcy must do some research in the archives. During her research with King Andrias she accidentally spills coffee on a tapestry, but discovers a button that opens a secret passage leading to a secret wing of the archives that had vital information.

The night before King Andrias would tell what their research uncovered, Marcy decides to have a sleepover with Anne, Sprig and Polly. Anne and Marcy realize that they never had a sleepover without Sasha as she is the ""Queen of Sleepovers"", but know that they have had enough experience to throw one for Sprig and Polly. They declare the sleepover mantra ""Pajamas, junk food and gossip galore, pillow fights, movies and tearing up the dance floor and listen up cus' this I won't repeat; never ever go to sleep"". They all proceed to run amok throughout the castle; upsetting Lady Olivia who tells them to never go into the basement. As the gang relax, they realize that it is only 9:00 pm and Anne insists that they do a Scare Dare Challenge with the loser's name going into the Book of Losers forever. Against Lady Olivia's warning, Anne suggests they head down into the basement. The kids sneak passed Lady Olivia, whom Polly draws on, and head down with them all refusing to turn back, lest their name end up in the Book of Losers. They enter a hallway full of mirrors and find a blocked doorway with a sign in ancient Newtonian runes saying that everyone correctly assumes that it's saying something like ""Keep Out"". They break it open anyway and find themselves in a flooded room full of coffins. Anne and Marcy try to prove their bravery by going to one of the coffins and taking a selfie, upon which jellyfish/ghost-like creatures emerge. They immediately deduce that they are deadly and flee the coffin room together. Along the way, Marcy notices a room full of growing plants that do not need sunlight, and Sprig takes note of a destroyed painting of what looks like King Andrias with two other individuals; a frog and a toad. The gang find a trap door that immediately enters Marcy's room, much to Marcy's surprise and confusion, but the ghosts phase in any way. They quickly discover that holding a mirror up to them makes them solid and push them back into the basement. The kids refuse to go to sleep and stay awake until morning. After wondering so many questions, they agree that the sleepover was great and all four of them add their names to the book. Anne and Marcy reveal that they have added their names numerous times and that Sasha always won. When Anne states that she needs to make up with Sasha, Marcy comforts her and assures they will find her. Lady Olivia angrily enters to tell them that their meeting with King Andrias is soon.


King Andrias shows everyone a book with information on the music box.

The human girls and the Planters arrive in the throne room where King Andrias showed them a book that tells them that the three gems on the music box need to be recharged. In order to do that, one must go to three separate temples to have each gem charged up, but the book only gives information on one of them. Hop Pop wants to get back to Wartwood as soon as possible so as not to miss the annual harvest. Anne suggests going back to pick up the music box and meet back up with Marcy at the first temple. However, Marcy suggests that Anne stay with her in Newtopia as them separating is the last thing they should do. Anne and the Plantars are visibly saddened by this logic, and Marcy suggests that they spend the day to themselves before they leave. The next morning, Anne says goodbye to the Plantars as they head back to Wartwood. Seeing how sad Anne is, Marcy admits that sending a servant to retrieve the music box might not be a good idea and that someone trusted should go. Anne hugs her and runs off to meet with her surrogate frog family. Once Anne has left, King Andrias comes up to Marcy with a proposition he believes would be very interesting to her. The king promised Marcy to take her and her human friends with her to other worlds with him and go and even more incredible adventures and she and her friends would never be apart; all she had to do was bring the Calamity Box back to Newtopia and give it to him once it was recharged. Not knowing Leviathan's true motives, Marcy agreed.


Marcy falls in love with the Plantars' home.

Marcy arrives on her avian transport Joe Sparrow, who announces that she has information on the first temple. They must venture to recharge the first of the box's gem (while temporally get distracted on how ""rustic and cute"" the Planter farm is). She explains that the temple is full of deadly traps and that no one has been able to surpass them. This actually excites Marcy, but Anne tells her that she has a habit of getting ""lost in the zone"" and tunes out everything else, much to her safety. Marcy brushes this aside as they arrive at the temple, via her sparrow steed. The group end up in a large cube shaped room where Anne discovers what looks like a puzzle cube. Upon holding it, the barer gets encompassed in a magnetic bubble. She gives the box to Marcy, who uses it to solve the puzzle. However, whenever she messes with it, it causes the room to turn and alter, harming Anne and the Plantars. Marcy manages to solve it and the door opens up, with Marcy excitedly rushing into the next room and disregarding her friends' wellbeing. The next room has a floor of colored tiles. The group quickly learn that the pink tiles are fire traps and blue tiles are spike traps. The green tiles are safe, but there are only two of them. Marcy jumps onto one and beckons someone else to hop on the other. Anne and Hop Pop both calmly argue with one another about who should jump on the green tile. While Hop Pop claims he should do it to redeem harming Anne, Anne feels she should do it as Hop Pop has suffered enough. Anne forcibly does so and manages to land on the tile, opening the door to the next room. Anne and Hop Pop continue arguing up until the next room, which contains a chess-like game called flip wart. Marcy just so happens to be an expert at the game, but upon setting up the pieces, Polly falls through the floor and ends up as the actual flip wart piece on a bigger board. Realizing that they are to be the actual pieces, Sprig and Hop Pop are also transferred to the big board while Anne is transferred to the opposing side, much to everyone's shock. Marcy uses her skills to try to avoid harming her friends, but the game cheats and Anne ends up harming Hop Pop. As Anne unwillingly chases Hop Pop across the board, Anne finally breaks down. She is not mad at Hop Pop ",2,1768009955.0,CharacterAMARoleplay,0,1.0,False

Quick sanity check on shipping timelines.

I have two coffee orders on the way to Miami (hotel delivery) and I’m leaving the country Monday, Jan 19:

\- Hydrangea (Berkeley, CA) → USPS Priority Mail. Hydrangea confirmed it will be shipped Monday.

\- Moonwake (San Jose, CA) → UPS 2nd Day Air. Moonwake confirmed it will be shipped Wednesday.

For those who ship/receive coffee a lot, especially between longer distances like CA to FL:

\*\*How has USPS Priority Mail, and UPS 2nd Day Air, from West Coast to Florida been lately?\*\*

Is Saturday delivery something you’d count on, or assume Friday is the real cutoff?

If the packages arrives after I leave and any Miami locals are interested in assuming the order and picking it up from the hotel (north of Miami Beach), happy to coordinate. Id make a good discount. The bags Ive selected in the image in case anyone’s interested.

\*\*Canceling the orders is also on the table…\*\* I have until tomorrows to cancel Hydrangea and until Monday to cancel Moonwake.

Feeding my cat human-grade food, supplements, cheap meat

Hi! I just adopted a rescue cat from the shelter and he’s settling in super well! I’m working up his diet to the normal 260kcal/day so he can get used to routine feeding and finishing all his food first. I’m on day 3 and currently at about 200kcal/day. I’m worried that I’m leaving him hungry in my build up process…

Anyways I feed him 2X a day: morning and night (12 hours apart). I also feed him a mix of wet food and dry food (the kibble he was eating in the shelter as that’s what he’s used to). I want to make the change to completely wet food, but I’m a uni student and really can’t afford that… so I may still incorporate a little of dry food if calories still remain. Or I was thinking of making human-grade snacks/meals. 

Human grade foods question:
So I know cats can eat a pretty wide variety of foods and I know what they can’t eat (ex. Grapes, coffee, cow milk, etc…), but I don’t know how I would incorporate them into meals/snacks. Like it’s obvious with the meat and stuff, but what about like blueberries and bananas? I know they can eat them but do I put them on as meal toppers? Or do I feed them like a treat by hand? Can I feed him human grade foods as treats between his AM and PM meals? Or would that disrupt his feeding routine?
- also where is the cheapest place to buy meat?

Supplements question:
So I know omega 3, probiotics, and hydration are super important. However, again, broke uni student. I know cats can eat sardines (1-2X a week) and will use that as my omega 3 source for now. I was wondering what other foods could “replace”supplements?

We’ve already done: coffee, movie, ice cream, and just chilling in a car talking, all pretty short (3 hours at most). I wanna suggest something that would be fun to do but I can’t think of anything. The reason I’m having trouble is because she currently has a broken foot, so no physical or large amounts of walking kind of dates. It’s also winter with snow where I live, so picnics or stuff like that won’t work. Any help would be appreciated!",2,1768009680.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I mean as treats/toppers. I will still be feeding him his regular foods, but am wondering how to go about giving human grade food

Feeding my cat human-grade food, supplements, cheap meat

Hi! I just adopted a rescue cat from the shelter and he’s settling in super well! I’m working up his diet to the normal 260kcal/day so he can get used to routine feeding and finishing all his food first. I’m on day 3 and currently at about 200kcal/day. I’m worried that I’m leaving him hungry in my build up process…

Anyways I feed him 2X a day: morning and night (12 hours apart). I also feed him a mix of wet food and dry food (the kibble he was eating in the shelter as that’s what he’s used to). I want to make the change to completely wet food, but I’m a uni student and really can’t afford that… so I may still incorporate a little of dry food if calories still remain. Or I was thinking of making human-grade snacks/meals. 

Human grade foods question:
So I know cats can eat a pretty wide variety of foods and I know what they can’t eat (ex. Grapes, coffee, cow milk, etc…), but I don’t know how I would incorporate them into meals/snacks. Like it’s obvious with the meat and stuff, but what about like blueberries and bananas? I know they can eat them but do I put them on as meal toppers? Or do I feed them like a treat by hand? Can I feed him human grade foods as treats between his AM and PM meals? Or would that disrupt his feeding routine?
- also where is the cheapest place to buy meat?

Supplements question:
So I know omega 3, probiotics, and hydration are super important. However, again, broke uni student. I know cats can eat sardines (1-2X a week) and will use that as my omega 3 source for now. I was wondering what other foods could “replace”supplements? 

FYI: I am Canadian so a lot of supplement, grocery, & pet food pricing here is a lot more expensive. ",1,1768009600.0,CatAdvice,16,1.0,False
1q8r2up,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q8r2up/ms_detergent/,[MS] Detergent,"He was watching her from outside, like he had so many times before. It had become a habit, like eating or sleeping. Tonight, she had something special planned. It wasn’t often that she went out in the evenings.

He watched as she moved through her wardrobe. She had so many outfits that even he could hardly keep track of them. He had only one himself. To him, she always seemed beautiful, no matter what she wore — even if she wore nothing at all. Her graceful frame made anything she chose look right. But the most mesmerizing thing about her was her lush auburn hair, lustrous locks that burned with warm passion.

He loved her. Maybe not in the usual way, but he was in love with her nonetheless.

She stood in front of the mirror on her tiptoes, holding the fabric against her bare skin. He could already tell that was the one she would pick. He knew her that well.

He heard a car pull into the driveway, followed soon after by a knock at the front door. It was a date. Since he had known her, she had been out on quite a few of those. He wasn’t jealous. It wasn’t that he ever deceived himself with the delusion that they would be together. It was enough to see her happy.

He quietly slipped through the backyard to watch them leave.

That’s when he noticed them.

Ether beasts. They couldn’t follow the man inside and were waiting outside instead. By the way they coiled around his limbs, he could tell they were bound to him. Two of them. They must have formed a union with him — whether he knew it or not.

He would have to do something about that.

He made his way through the backyards, careful not to leave visible tracks in the snow toward where he stayed. It had felt like home for quite some time now, though he still wouldn’t call it ‘his place’. Of course it wasn’t. It was hers, and she didn’t even know he lived there.

But it was all he had.

Some would never know what it felt like to lose a home. He still missed his. Ever since he came here, the town had never hesitated to remind him that he didn’t belong. But there was nowhere else for him to go.

And now, there was her.

Her presence filled his life with small things that made everything seem better.

He stayed in the old wooden shack tucked into the corner of her backyard — or behind it, depending on how you looked at it. It hardly mattered. She barely ever used it. The tools inside were rusted and forgotten.

Most of the backyard was occupied by her flower garden, where she grew roses, narcissus, and a plethora of other flowers he couldn’t name. In summer, it looked wild and beautiful.

In fact, that was where they had met.

He had seen her tending to her rose bushes as he passed by. She’d had a rodent problem then — they were digging up her flowers, and it clearly frustrated her. He got rid of them for her. In fact, he made sure there wasn’t another rodent left in the whole neighborhood.

Besides that, there was only an ebbing apple tree hunched near the shack, and a small patio where she would sometimes come out to enjoy her morning coffee.



Through his sleep, he heard the car when it came back.

He quickly shook off the remnants of a dream still clinging to his senses and went back out to watch them. They lingered in the car for a while. Eventually, she went back inside, and the man drove away.

He followed him.

It would take time, but eventually he would track him down to his house, and he had all night.

Yesterday’s snow had already been cleared from the sidewalks, leaving only stray patches of glistening powder behind. It was cold, but he handled it well — winter was his favorite time of year. Along the roadside, snow had accumulated into brown, frozen sludge.

It was strange how people could take something so common and plentiful and make it seem undesirable, ugly and vile. Or maybe it was simply nature’s work — consuming the old to evolve something new — and that reason escaped his understanding.

He wondered about it as he walked alone along empty sidewalks, bleached yellow by streetlights.

He tracked the man to his apartment building and watched from across the street. The ether beasts never left his side while he was awake. They were clearly invested in him, for whatever reason.

He didn’t mind ether creatures. He cared little for them. But they would corrupt and consume her to feed this man. He couldn’t allow that.

He twitched as pain flared in his stomach. It must have been something he ate.

He would need to prepare for a few days to deal with ether beasts — abstain from food and sleep. Hopefully, that would give him enough time to figure out how to get close to them.

Before dawn, he returned to her.

The next night, he came back to continue watching them.

When the man went to bed, one of the beasts descended to the boutique across the street and lingered there. The other stayed behind in the apartment. The following night, it did the same. Apparently, it was fond of the pretty things displayed behind the glass.

He could use that.

On the third night, he was ready to make his move.

He waited at the corner of the boutique for the man to go to sleep and for the ether beast to make its way down. It looked straight past him, as if he wasn’t there at all. When the creature finally registered his gaze tracking it, it was too late.

He moved in close enough to slice its throat open.

The beast looked confused, clutching at the gaping wound in its neck as it collapsed to the ground, those same empty eyes staring ahead. A moment later, it let out a piercing death screech.

He winced as the sound cut into his ears like a sharp silver needle.

It didn’t take long for the other one to react.

It rushed down into the street, rabid with fury. Its eyes burned with rage when it saw his handiwork. The two of them were probably mates.

Its arm materialized into a sharp claw and it swung at him instantly — but not fast enough. He avoided it, slashing back at its head, but only caught its chest.

He felt his strength beginning to fail. He had to finish this quickly.

The beast didn’t hesitate. It pounced, and he barely managed to hold it back as it snapped its foaming, gaping maw inches from his face. He stabbed into its side again and again, as fast as he could, until he did enough damage for the creature to loosen its grip.

When it did, he went for its neck.

Defeated, it lay on the frozen ground. Blood from its wounds slowed until it barely leaked at all. Its empty eyes never closed, as if it still hoped to lash out one last time.

He stayed, watching it until it was dead.

That was when he noticed the others, drawn in by the death screeching.

One peeked from an alleyway ahead. Two more dropped down from the same apartment building. A few more lingered in the distance.

He knew they wanted the bodies, and that they wouldn’t follow him — but just in case, he kept them in sight, cautiously backing away.

None of them did.

He had almost made it back home when he collapsed in her backyard, beneath the apple tree.

It wasn’t the wounds from the ether beasts — they had hardly scratched him. He had noticed something strange days ago, when pain first began twisting in his stomach. He couldn’t drink. Lesions had started appearing on his skin.

He must have eaten something poisoned.

He tried to ignore it, hoping it would pass. Now he had to admit it wasn’t going to. Somewhere, he must have overlooked something — or hadn’t been careful enough.

His muscles stopped twitching, and he felt the cold slowly creeping through his limbs. Not a kind of cold he had ever felt before. Not painful, or alarming.

Comforting.

His insides were still twisting in sharp knots of pain, but it felt like he could drift off to sleep right there—

No. Not here.

He couldn’t let her find his body. He couldn’t let her see him like this.

It was agony to move, every motion tearing his muscles into a thousand tiny fragments. He stopped halfway to the shack to catch his breath. Even breathing was shallow and painful now.

His unconscious tears rolled down his cheeks, disappearing into the snow.

Slowly, he made it behind the shack and climbed inside, where he finally let it consume him — until there was no more pain.

He wasn’t sad that he had to die. He had no regrets.

No one would miss him. No one would even notice he was gone.

After all, he was just a fox.

He would stick around her for a little longer, just to make sure she was alright.",1,1768009529.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.  

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.
    
About me:
- Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan  
- Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee  
- Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight
    
What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.  

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.
    
You:  
- Japanese (living anywhere in the world)  
- 20–46  
- Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever  
- Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)  
- Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies
    
A little more about the woman I hope writes me:
You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or city abroad)
3. One question for me

1q8r1z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1q8r1z6/feeding_my_cat_humangrade_food_supplements_cheap/,"Feeding my cat human-grade food, supplements, cheap meat","Hi! I just adopted a rescue cat from the shelter and he’s settling in super well! I’m working up his diet to the normal 260kcal/day so he can get used to routine feeding and finishing all his food first. I’m on day 3 and currently at about 200kcal/day. I’m worried that I’m leaving him hungry in my build up process…

Anyways I feed him 2X a day: morning and night (12 hours apart). I also feed him a mix of wet food and dry food (the kibble he was eating in the shelter as that’s what he’s used to). I want to make the change to completely wet food, but I’m a uni student and really can’t afford that… so I may still incorporate a little of dry food if calories still remain. Or I was thinking of making human-grade snacks/meals. 

Human grade foods question:
So I know cats can eat a pretty wide variety of foods and I know what they can’t eat (ex. Grapes, coffee, cow milk, etc…), but I don’t know how I would incorporate them into meals/snacks. Like it’s obvious with the meat and stuff, but what about like blueberries and bananas? I know they can eat them but do I put them on as meal toppers? Or do I feed them like a treat by hand? Can I feed him human grade foods as treats between his AM and PM meals? Or would that disrupt his feeding routine?
- also where is the cheapest place to buy meat?

Supplements question:
So I know omega 3, probiotics, and hydration are super important. However, again, broke uni student. I know cats can eat sardines (1-2X a week) and will use that as my omega 3 source for now. I was wondering what other foods could “replace”supplements? 

FYI: I am Canadian so a lot of supplement, grocery, & pet food pricing here is a lot more expensive. ",1,1768009458.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

Tried Menu 1 and everything was in great shape, including the heater which worked instantly! Chili was very tasty and went well with the cornbread. Better than any Hormel I've had. The combos also in excellent shape and a nice taste difference to the sweeter options. Cheese and crackers (my favorite mre side besides PBJ) was also a welcome addition. The grape gatorade style powder was a bit sweet but would be welcome in an outdoor/high energy burning environment. Taste was very tolerable.

The after dinner coffee and gum was decent. No complaints.

I just got into woodworking in the last year, starting with raised beds and other planters made from cedar posts. When I stumbled on someone selling slabs of cherry on Facebook marketplace for around $50 near me, I decided to try my hand at a coffee table. (I think the piping for the base cost more than the wood, hah.)

I looked at a few tutorials, but a lot of it was just futzing around with different things. The slabs were already roughly planed, so I chiseled the bark off the sides and then smoothed it out with a random orbit sander and increasingly fine grit. Then I did an epoxy pour. Realized I didn’t love the high gloss look, so I proceeded to sand down the expoxy to matte it out. Then I did several rounds of wiping with tung oil followed by very fine grit sanding, and then the same with wipe on polyurethane. I’m guessing all the different finishes was overkill and unnecessary? ",18,1768009296.0,woodworking,4,1.0,False
1q8qz7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q8qz7v/the_crossroads_at_camellias_tavern/,The Crossroads At Camellia's Tavern,"*“There’s times I need direction*

*There’s times I need to roam*

*I move station to station*

*I showed up here alone.”*

*Arrow - The Head And The Heart*

Camellia’s Tavern. That’ll do.

I amble through the red doors at a quarter o’ ten. A blackboard sign out front had the words “Open Mike Night” scrawled in a sloppy yellow chalk. My kind o’ place.

It’s packed inside. There’s a guy on a small stage in the corner doing his best to make people laugh at politics. The booze is doing the heavy lifting.

The bartender is wearin’ a shirt that says, “Breathe if you’re horny.” I ask him if he’s got any coffee.

“You’re the second one tonight.” He pours it into a small styrofoam cup and pushes it in front of me. “Five bucks.”

“For coffee?”

“Coffee drinkers don’t never tip, so y’all got to pay it up front.” The double negative confirms my suspicion that he’s responsible for the sign outside. I give him five. All I got left to my name is $11.22. There’s no room at the bar, and it’s too cold to go back outside just yet.

I walk through the smoke, lookin’ for a seat. I see one table with an empty chair. A small table with a small woman sittin’ by herself. A long black peacoat drapes around her chair and the collar’s turned up. Black hair down to her shoulders. Ratty white gloves with the fingers missing cradle a styrofoam cup. A leather journal sits on the table in front of her with the words, “Any Poem, Any Price” written across the cover. 

The comic finishes his set and the crowd gives a round of lazy applause when I approach her.

“Excuse me?” She looks up and squints. “Mind if I sit down?” She eyes me up and down. She focuses on the bag I have over my shoulder and then my guitar case.

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“Do you play?”

“If you wanna call it that.” She squints her eyes again. She pushes the empty chair out from the table with her foot. “Much obliged.”

“You’re not supposed to be here.” 

“I’m not?”

“I just…” She stops mid sentence. She’s beautiful. “I’m Ella.”

“Sam.”

“Are you here to play?”

“Hell no. I just got into town from Jackson.”

“The roads are icy out there.”

“Didn’t drive. I came in on the train.” It takes her a minute and then she smiles. God, that smile.

“Are you a musical hobo or somethin’?”

“Or somethin’.” I notice a hand drawn daffodil on the cover of her journal. “You here to recite a poem?”

“Or somethin’.”

We talk. We ignore the music, the comedy, and the musin’s. She tells me that she’s from New Orleans. I tell her I’m from a town called Mariposa. We’re both just passin’ through. She asks me if I’ll play somethin’  for her, I tell her I will if she recites a poem for me.

\-

A trio is murderin’ “Free Bird”.

She has me. I’m bewitched. 

I tell her that I’ve been movin’ and wanderin’and when she asks why, I tell her the truth.

“Everythin’ feels fake when I stop movin’. If I’m movin’, I feel real. No one seems real anymore. So I keep movin’. I don’t know if that makes any sense.”

“It does. Just look at everyone in here. You can read them all by their eyes. Nothing behind them. All lies and dishonesty. If they ever heard REAL truth…” She drifts off and then she looks back at me. “You seem like a real person to me. I’m sure one day you’ll find a place that’ll make you want to slow down.”

“Or somethin’.” 

“I need to tell you the truth.” She looks worried. “I came in here for a reason. I have a job to do tonight.”

“What… are you gonna shoot the place up or somethin’?” 

She looks down at her journal.

“Or somethin’.”

The desecration of Skynard ends, and Ella stands up.

“Sam? Just trust me… don’t be scared. When you hear it, I know you’ll be fine.”

“What?”

“Real truth.” She turns and walks to the small stage. Several drunk assholes want “the beatnick” off the stage. Ella flips through the pages of her journal and settles somewhere in the middle. A couple of glasses of beer fly toward the stage and then it starts.

Or stops.

Ella speaks her truth.

Everything slows down. The beers movin’ toward the stage almost freeze in the air. Everyone in the bar gets up in slow motion. Ella’s voice is in my head. Felt more than heard. I don’t wanna move. For the first time in my life, I wanna be still. 

She keeps recitin’ her poem, but she stops lookin’ in her journal, and instead looks at me. 

Those eyes.

Now I move.

I stand up and walk forward, unencumbered by whatever lethargic spell the crowd is under. She’s spun a different spell on me.

 The whole crowd is gettin’ to their feet, makin’ low drawn out hollers of pain and agony. They pull at their clothes. Their bodies plump up slowly, like they’re bein’ filled from an air compressor. Faces distort. Eyes protrude. Shirts and blouses rip thread by thread.

I walk under the glasses that are inchin’ toward the stage while the beer that was inside ‘em is suspended in the air like a dawdlin’ creek. Ella keeps speakin’. Her eyes stay on me.

I step onto the stage. A rumblin’ fills the room. The crowd explodes behind me at a glacial pace in a helluva gory show. Limbs and insides are blown asunder. Ella finishes and I put my hand around her waist and pull her to me.

“That’s a helluva poem.” We look back at the bar. The whole bloody collage may as well be in zero gravity. “I was wonderin’ somethin’ though.”

“What?”

“Think we can set your words to a guitar?”

“Or somethin’.”

She smiles.

📦 The Gems:

CB2 Coffee Table ($50): CB2 tables usually retail for $300-$500. Getting one for $50 is a steal.

Gold Arched Mirror ($30): The classic ""Anthropologie Dupe"" look. Perfect for an entryway or bedroom vanity.

Velvet Headboard Bed: Looks like a Queen size, plush black velvet.

Floor Lamps & Cart: Also available.



🧐 Gary's Note:

""⚠️ Long Shot Alert: The listing says 'Must go by 12/30', so this is technically overdue.

BUT, the post is still up.

This usually means the seller failed to sell it and is now desperate.

If they still have that CB2 table or the Mirror, you could probably offer them $60 for BOTH and they might just say yes to clear the space.

It's a bit of a drive to LA, but for these specific items, the gas money is worth it.""

It's complex written out but I normally don't have problems ordering it and it's quite tasty :) but lately baristas have been giving me grief about the amount of oatmilk I order, saying if I put so much oatmilk in they have to call it a latte and charge me more. Just today, I ordered, my drink didn't have enough milk in it so I requested for the barista add a splash more oatmilk for me. She tells me that if she does that it becomes a latte so she can't. I've already paid, mind you. She finally gives me some in a small cup (literally a tablespoon) and I go on with my day, but am I doing something wrong? Is there another way I need to order this, or am I just getting people who are misinformed?

Before anyone points it out, I know this is just a cheap Iced Hazelnut Oatmilk shaken espresso, but I found those were always inconsistent from store to store, and I have a dairy allergy so my order takes away the fear of cross contamination with the shaker. Also, I don't like lattes, for me they're too much milk and not enough coffee flavor. I'm picky lol. 

Thanks in advance. Sorry if I come off as a Karen, I just don't know why oatmilk seems to be a touch and go system from store to store. ",0,1768009017.0,starbucks,17,0.29,False

Books I reached for the most:

https://preview.redd.it/1afsek9pcfcg1.jpg?width=2929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7282390ed269fae851283b80271d2ae083aa1da

1. Smitten Kitchen Keepers by Deb Perelman - Deb’s recipes are so dependably solid, and if she asks you to do extra work, it’s worth it! Her recipes are the most crowd-pleasing that I’ve made. 
2. Kapusta by Alissa Timoshkina - There has been a serious wintertime gap in my vegetarian cooking; most of my vegetable-centered books are Mediterranean, Middle-eastern, Indian, or southern Californian. This book is filled with dishes that are perfect for wintry weather, and a MAJOR bonus is that the produce they call for is affordable (cabbage, carrots, mushrooms). These recipes have been easy and so rewarding.
3. Molly On the Range by Molly Yeh - This is the book I go for when I want to be inspired; I love her taste and I trust her flavors. This book has two of my all-time favorite versions of staples (hummus and vegetarian meatballs). I’ve had less luck with the desserts though, so I tend to stick with the savory things.
4. The Woks of Life by Bill, Kaitlin, Judy, and Sarah Leung - This is such a well-written, solid book. I started out a complete beginner to cooking Chinese food and these recipes have still been easy to follow - and so tasty! It blows my mind that my kitchen can produce these dishes.
5. I Dream of Dinner (So You Don’t Have To) by Ali Slagle - These are so approachable, even when you’re brain-fried and tired. I love that there’s so many I haven’t tried yet! They haven’t all been hits, but the hits got repeated often.
6. Snacking Cakes by Yossi Arefi - What a delightful resource this has been. Everything so easy, and so reliable that I would try recipes for the first time at get-togethers (I usually test them first). I don't really make a habit of dessert but my spouse loves to have something sweet on workdays, and this book has been invaluable for hassle-free goodness.

1. Harissa Chickpeas with Feta from I Dream of Dinner (So You Don’t Have To) by Ali Slagle - I wasn’t totally sold on this the first time I tried it, but the acidic flavors absolutely stuck with me and I ended up craving it regularly ever since. This is my go-to comfort dish, made with things I generally have on hand. I’ve made it too many times to count.

# January of winters past

**By Grace Samuelson**

https://preview.redd.it/l5th89rxbfcg1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=095076a11c0e743694ae06ee3b841207d4b112aa

We’ve turned the calendar pages to the clean sheet of the new year. Things are settling down now to routine; the frantic rush of the holidays over; normal activities begin. The frigid weather may curtail our plans, but we have to make the best of it. I watch as the school children gather up at the corner for the bus, and I think back to those January days when we braved sub-zero weather to walk to school. It must have been 1911 that I recall so well; the meteorologist on TV showed record cold that year. I was six then, going on seven; Verna was going on nine.

Bundled to the eyeballs, we were warmly attired in what today is considered proper winter weather manner — the layered — to protect from wintry blasts. First, the long, woolen underwear, black cotton stockings, high buttoned shoes. Flour sack garter waist and petticoat, with an outing petticoat and dark flannel bloomers, for extra warmth. The winter school dress, of navy serge, protected with a gingham apron. This far dressed, we could appear from behind the coal stove where we dressed, rush to the washroom that would become the bathroom some day.

We carried a dipper full of warm water from the reservoir, and washed up quickly. There was always a big bar of **Ivory soap** (99 and 44/100 percent pure) or an oval bar of **J-- Rose**, or **Pear** soap handy. If the rain water in the cistern had run dry, Mama would put a few drops of tincture of benzoin in our wash water to soften it and help prevent chapped faces and hands. Rose water and glycerine stood nearby and we were instructed to rub it in well, to avoid cracked knuckles and roughened skin.

By that time the smell of frying bacon and the oatmeal, which had steamed overnight in the double boiler at the back of the coal stove, whetted our appetites so that we even sampled the buckwheat cakes that Papa and Mama ate every winter morning, but which we disliked. Thus well stoked, we ran up into the chilly bedrooms to make our beds and then come down to wash the dishes and sweep the kitchen, while Mama kneaded flour into the “sponge” that had been rising overnight, all wrapped up behind the stove. Mondays she would be washing, of course, and on Tuesdays the ironing board was set up close to the kitchen range where the sad-irons were heating. Each day held its scheduled duty and work. Play and meals were really dependent upon the weather and daily routine.

When our chores were done and it was getting close to school time, we piled more layers of clothing on. First, the wool sweaters and over that the chamois vest Papa had made us. Then, long woolen socks over our shoes, and before we drew on our high buckled overshoes we slipped into (or rather, **tugged** into) black cotton tights, secured at the waist with a draw string. These went under our dresses, and we pulled on our overshoes before stuffing our layered forms into the hand-me-down “chinchilla” coats, pulling our scarfs up over our faces, so that just our eyes peered out. Our hands, doubled-mittened, waved good-bye to Mama, working in the heat of the range, and we were on our way, fortified inside and out, hunched into the wind, snow squeaking under our overshoes, breath fast forming mustaches on our red scarfs. Verna helped me over the biggest drifts and I can remember blubbering from the cold a good share of the way.

But we were lucky — we had only about six blocks to go. Our friends from out Evergreen way, or beyond the Little Lake, or the poor Sawyer kids who faced the blustery winds on the old bridge, had it much worse. They surely must have suffered more from frosted fingers, chillblains, frozen ears or noses. We would meet in the drafty cloak rooms and remove our outer wraps, stamping our feet and rubbing reddened fingers to restore the circulation. The cold brought us all to the same level.

Those school children today are faced with the same degree of cold as they wait for their early bus ride. But their layered clothing is of a different type, emerging from drawstring and button stage to zippered closings, down-filled or pile-lined jackets, lighter weight, and practical.

The kindergarten and lower grade teachers who struggled to help youngsters off and on with winter wraps and the Mothers who dress their offspring protectively for outside play may find it a bit easier to zip up a young one’s clothes, but I’d guarantee that most mothers find the same frustration: shortly after they’re all bundled up they’re in again, wanting to be unzipped. Like the little fellow who told his teacher after she’d put on his boots, “These aren’t my boots.” Wearily, she tugged them off, and then he said, “They’re my brother’s. He gave ’em to me.”

That New Year of 1911 had started out about the same as other years past, and for some years to come. Making resolutions which didn’t change much with the years, and weren’t resolved too long. Attending watch night services at church, and feeling very grown-up to be allowed to go, though we may have fallen asleep before midnight, and dreamed all of the way home, pulled on a sled. In the 20’s, when we acquired a radio, we felt the miracle of hearing Big Ben strike the midnight hour, 3,000 miles away. The words of Auld Lang Syne, coming over the airwaves; sound of the New Year’s crowd in Times Square. The Roosevelt years, when we prayed that each old year would take with it the depression. Then came T.V. and we saw the huge ball drop in Times Square and heard Guy Lombardo’s music. Celebrations loud or quiet, happy or sad, but always the hope that the New Year would bring something better.

So our recreations have changed. From lively games of fox and geese, making “angels” in the snow, bellyflopping on our sleds, skating and playing crack the whip down on Market Square, or if we were real daring, on the bay, with the chance that you, at the end of the “whip” could be slid right into open water, your heavy woolen clothes pulling you down. And even though you were safely rescued and escaped pneumonia, that winter coat was never the same again. The thrill of sliding all the way down Lawrence’s hill with the feel of flying, then landing way out on the ice! The privilege of traveling across the expanse of ice on an ice-boat, of being allowed to go along with someone fishing through the ice in a chilly ice-shanty. Making forts and snowmen; molding myriads of snow balls.

And, inside — scratching thick frost on the windows to write our names, and to be scolded because it would leave the glass all messy. Curling up beside the coal stove with a favorite library book and a bowl of apples. Practicing your music lesson in the parlor, where the ivory keys felt like slices of ice, and you shivered because the door didn’t let in much heat from the dining room stove.

I remember the time I wanted to iron my doll’s dress, and I put the toy sad iron on top of the coals to heat. It got red hot, and Mama told me, “You’ve ruined the iron — that takes the temper out of it.” “Why?” I thought. “When I get mad, they want me to get rid of my temper.” So confusing.

I don’t think today’s young folks would care to change their snowmobile, skis, plastic sleds, figure skates, year round swimming in the pool, their cars, or even some airplanes for our available recreation, but fun is where you find it, in whatever age you live.

Nor do I think they’d care for our type of cures for our ills: the hated camphorated goose grease rubbed on our chests, ﬂax-seed or onion poultices, which held the heat so well and smelled so bad. The senna leaves I had to chew if I wasn’t “regular.” Having your hair put up on rags after your Saturday night bath in the wash tub so that you could wear curls to Sunday school next day, tied with a brand new ribbon. Now hair is **styled**, for boys as well as girls, and if you want curls you get a permanent.

No doubt the hamburgers, tacoes, pizza, and french-fries rouse their taste buds as much as those treats we remember. A woman told me the other day, “The best thing of all was a slice of homemade bread spread with lard.” We didn’t have pork often at home — Papa was partial to dairy butter, but for those who enjoyed dipping their bread in pork or bacon drippings, know it was a treat. During the depression years, when dairy products were so available to us, we enjoyed the bread puddings, rice, or baked custards, peanut butter cookies and homemade cottage cheese. And I know that all my children would heartily agree that no one made more delicious sour cream, or molasses cookies than their Grandma Samuelson. It was easy to mix a whipped cream cake, applesauce cake, or Mama’s devil’s food. Coffee, made with egg, came quickly to a boil on the range; vegetable soup filled the room with tempting fragrance, while the old teakettle sang a cheerful song and sent out clouds of steam that humidified the room and kept the houseplants healthy. We were all pretty healthy.

January, both in childhood years and with a growing family provided a wonderful time to be **inside . . .** in 1936 especially. The winds could blow and the snow and ice block your driveway; rag rugs kept the drafts and frost from creeping in under the doors; we had a haven there. You didn’t have to worry about pipes freezing; there were no water pipes in the house. The children were entertained by Uncle Mal’s stories on WLS radio; the almanac was handy, and my needlepoint was on the old treadle machine close by, where I could pick it up and work a row or two while the iron heated, or potatoes boiled. The seed catalogs came in the mail and I could drool over the pictures and plan summer’s ﬂower and vegetable gardens. I could visit with friends on the party line, help the girls in and out of snow suits, and the stove and I could provide those welcome-home-smells I recalled from my childhood. I remember January. No winter blahs, but I did get cabin fever after six-weeks of sub-zero weather.

1q8qk30,https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1q8qk30/sortarr_media_library_insights_for_sonarr_radarr/,Sortarr – Media library insights for Sonarr & Radarr (Docker-friendly),"Hey all,

I wanted to share a side project I’ve been working on called Sortarr and get some broader feedback from UnRaid users.

Sortarr is a read-only dashboard that connects to Sonarr and/or Radarr and helps you understand how your media library is actually using disk space. It does not touch or modify your files, it just surfaces useful data that the Arr apps already have but don’t present very well.

# Screenshots:

[Sonarr view](https://preview.redd.it/h1bj4aywafcg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f5a5d0d3bc92f51e49dd09649eb6806a45fa66)

[Radarr view](https://preview.redd.it/pcv9ptivbfcg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=52fc85a349ad513367b419e9fd8449f1271454c0)

# What it does in practice

Sortarr pulls data from Sonarr and Radarr and lets you:

* See how much space each show or movie is using
* Compare runtime vs file size (GiB per hour is surprisingly useful)
* Sort and filter to find:
   * bloated encodes
   * oversized / undersized seasons
   * titles that might not be worth their disk footprint
* Export the data to CSV if you want to analyse or script against it yourself

If you’ve ever wondered “why is my array filling up so fast?” or “which shows are actually the worst offenders?”, this is aimed at that exact problem.

# Why this exists

I run Plex on UnRaid with a fairly large Sonarr and Radarr managed library. I didn’t want another automation tool that deletes or replaces media, I wanted visibility first.

Sortarr is intentionally:

* read-only
* lightweight
* focused on insight, not enforcement

You decide what to do with the information.

# Docker and UnRaid friendly

* Runs as a Docker container
* No database setup required
* Just point it at your Sonarr and Radarr URLs and API keys
* Works well alongside existing UnRaid Arr stacks

It also exposes a small HTTP API, which some users are feeding into their own scripts or dashboards.

# Optional extras

* Supports multiple Sonarr and Radarr instances
* Optional Tautulli integration for playback context
* Basic auth available if you expose it internally
* Compare and contrast format, codec, HDR, etc

# Still evolving, looking for feedback

This project is still early in development. I first posted it in r/PleX, and I’m now looking for:

* feedback from users with large libraries
* more filtering options
* edge cases from unusual Arr setups
* UI and UX suggestions
* bug reports or feature ideas that make sense for UnRaid users

I’m deliberately keeping the scope sane, so good feedback matters more than feature spam.

# Links

* GitHub repo [https://github.com/Jaredharper1/Sortarr](https://github.com/Jaredharper1/Sortarr?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Recent changes and updates [https://github.com/Jaredharper1/Sortarr/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Jaredharper1/Sortarr/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you try it out and something feels off, please open an issue or comment here.  
Happy to answer questions about how it fits into an UnRaid media stack.
