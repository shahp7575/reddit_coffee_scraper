I’m really lost right now and I would love some advice or similar experiences.

Before developing POTS, I had a completely normal student life:
	•	I went out on weekends,
	•	I drank alcohol only on weekends,
	•	I smoked weed only during parties,
	•	but I used a lot of snus (nicotine) regularly.

Everything changed after a trip with my friends. I spent two days with almost no sleep, drank a lot of alcohol, consumed a lot of nicotine, and then took a 5 AM flight right after leaving a party.

On the plane, I felt like I was about to pass out. I drank a coffee, and it calmed down for a moment.
But the moment I landed, I felt a strange pressure rising from my feet to my head, and then my heart started beating extremely fast.

I went to the ER several times. My symptoms kept getting worse:
	•	I couldn’t stand up,
	•	shortness of breath,
	•	palpitations,
	•	chest pressure,
	•	and a lot of fear because I didn’t understand what was happening.

I want to add that I had experienced this exact feeling once after smoking weed, but it went away quickly that time.

Eventually, I was diagnosed with POTS.
I was given beta blockers, an antidepressant, and some other medication. Lately I’m doing a bit better — I even managed to walk for 1 hour recently, which was impossible before.

Since then, I’ve quit everything: alcohol, nicotine, weed, parties, everything.
But I still have the desire to get my old life back. I had to take a gap year because of this, I’m a student, I’m only 21… I really hope to fully recover one day, especially since I used to be healthy, athletic, and ate well.

Recently I heard that to truly recover, you need to understand the exact cause that disrupted your nervous system.
But I feel completely lost. I also stress a lot, and I got sick during the trip… so I don’t know what triggered it.

👉 Do you think my POTS could come from:
	•	exhaustion + lack of sleep + alcohol + nicotine overload?
	•	a stress-induced autonomic shutdown/dysautonomia?
	•	catching a virus during the trip?
	•	a panic attack that messed up my autonomic nervous system?
	•	or something else?

If any of you had a similar trigger, or know how to identify the root cause, I would really appreciate your help.

Thank you so much.",1,1765484095.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

I posted some questions here a few weeks ago and received great support – many thanks for that!

All the practical things are sorted now: the apartment is signed, and I’ll be moving to the area called *Stare Miasto*, right by Galeria Kaskada. It’s just a 10-minute walk to the office. From what I’ve been able to find out, it seems like a good part of the city. Do you agree?

So, I have a few more questions about everyday life in Szczecin (which I finally learned how to pronounce):

1. **How will I manage daily life with English?** In shops, cafés, bars, etc.? I’m doing some Polish practice now, but it will only be basic at first. I’m very open to learning more and becoming conversational, but that won’t happen in a week or two.
2. **Speaking of everyday life:** I really love good Italian coffee, cozy and retro-style bars, and nice local places to eat. What would you recommend trying out?
3. **IKEA question:** I’ll need to pick up some things to furnish the apartment. Do they offer home delivery, or are there any other services people normally use?
4. **Where do locals shop for groceries and essentials?** I understand Biedronka is a big thing in Poland – is that the place or any other recommendations? I also love buying local produce from markets, like a farmer’s market. Is there anything like that in Szczecin?
5. **My new employer mentioned a medical check-up before starting work.** What does that usually include? Where I live it’s basically checking blood pressure, eyesight, a few questions about your general health – and that’s it. Is it similar here?
6. **What do you love most about living in Szczecin?** I guess that might be the most important question. 😊
7. **Anything else I should know or think about?**

And if you’re a local (or an expat) interested in showing me around and maybe making a new friend when I’m there, feel free to let me know. 😊",1,1765484003.0,Szczecin,0,1.0,False
1pk7oje,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmoshFansFreeSpace/comments/1pk7oje/quick_to_clip/,Quick to clip,"I'm one of those people who will not always watch a video immediately as it's released. Sometimes I'll leave it for the day after so I've got something new to watch with my morning coffee.

I hate, oh my word I HATE the fact that a video isn't out for even 20mins, but someone already has moments clipped and has posted it on social media. It isn't that serious, I know, I actually don't like that it angers me so much, but I can't help it. It doesn't even have to be an important moment that gives away the video, it could be the smallest thing, an extra funny moment that happened, I get so goddamn annoyed that I've now seen a glimpse of it without having watched the actual video, and then when I do end up watching it I feel like I cannot concentrate on a majority of the video because I'm anticipating part of the clipped portion I saw before scrolling and my mind will try to gauge when it happens.

I have blocked so many accounts, specifically on TikTok, because of this and I know it's a stupid thing to get upset about since people live on social media and we're going to see things we don't want to whether we like it or not. It's just so irritating. Like are people even genuinely watching the videos to sit and enjoy them? It feels like they just sit hovering for a funny clip or even something that isn't worth being clipped and then they move on to the next. Like chill man.

1pk7o66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pk7o66/update_i_30f_think_im_going_to_leave_my_husband/,UPDATE: I (30F) think I’m going to leave my husband (35M),"Hi everyone, OP here. 

Before I start, I just wanted to say thank you for all your comments and messages, they really opened my eyes and gave me a fresh perspective on the entire situation. If you remember my previous post from r/relationships (it got removed), I mentioned that I was thinking about leaving my husband. Well, after doing a lot of said thinking and talking to my close friends, therapist, and several DV advocates, I can safely say I’m no longer thinking about leaving him.

I *am* leaving him.

For years, I thought my husband just wanted what was best for me. I thought him telling me  how I should run, train, or “improve” myself was because he wanted me to be happy. But even after I told him multiple times how this bothered me, he still didn’t stop. He even does it during intimacy, telling me what he “likes” on me repeatedly, like he’s grading me or telling me what I ought to be doing instead of just enjoying the moment. Nothing is ever enough.

And that wasn’t all. He would also go through these ridiculous mood swings where any little thing could set him off, whether that be the spilled coffee grounds I mentioned previously or, most recently, me not giving him the answer he expected. That last one caused him to give me the silent treatment for *three days straight,* during which he slept on the couch completely of his own volition (Ironically, those were probably the most peaceful three days of my life). It’s not the first time he’s done that either.

I’m realizing that financially, it’s been messed up too. He makes more than me, yet he’s often low on money and I’ve been covering a *lot.* This was common in the early days of our relationship when he couldn’t work, but what’s his excuse now? Even when I got unexpectedly laid off, he let me work *three* part-time jobs instead of offering to help me the way I helped him. He’s always talking about financial responsibility, yet leaves so much of it to me.

Also, I didn’t mention this in my previous post, but his brother has been staying with us for the past year and a half to attend grad school nearby. That itself didn’t bother me, but the brother’s attitude does. Because of his status (he’s also an immigrant student), I never expected him to pay rent, but I *did* expect him to help or contribute to the household in a positive manner, something which he just can’t seem to do. Instead, he barely talks to me or my husband, doesn’t say please or thank you, and when he’s not at school or his on-campus job, spends all his time in his room (which used to be the office). 

There was one recent incident where I made dinner for everyone (something my husband and I take turns doing) and, instead of staying to eat with us, the brother took his plate to his room without so much as a thank you directed at me. I didn’t tell my husband at the time, but I was *furious.* We’ve spoken about his brother’s behavior before (especially during couples’ therapy), but despite my repeated asking, my husband has never addressed it.

Anyway, when I thought about all these incidents together, along with previous ones that occurred throughout our relationship, I realized I didn’t want to live like this anymore. I can’t spend the rest of my life walking on eggshells and tiptoeing around his moods just to keep the peace. Although we’d talked about having a family someday, that’s not something I want anymore. The man throws a fit over a bad night’s sleep or a messy countertop—how would he ever cope with a newborn?

I’ve secured a new place near my work and the keys are hidden in my purse as I write this. I’ve been discreetly packing under the guise of “donations” while transporting boxes to a small storage unit, and I plan to leave in just a few days. My friend is having a holiday party this weekend, and since I usually stay the night, I’ll be using that as a cover to take my essentials. I’ll return the next day while he’s out to pick up our cat under the guise of taking her to an appointment (the only reason I’m not taking her the same day is because she gets very anxious while traveling, and I want to streamline the process as much as possible).

I drafted an email that I’ll send once I’m safely out, framing it as a temporary “separation” instead of a permanent split to hopefully try and mitigate some of the damage (and besides, in my state, you have to be separated for a while anyways before you can file for divorce). I also plan to email my current landlord once I’m out to explain the circumstances and try to get my name off the lease. Considering the brother is still living there, I’m sure having him replace me won’t be an issue (for the landlord at least—ha!) 

Am I nervous? Yes, incredibly. I’m terrified of my (soon-to-be-ex) husband’s reaction or of something going wrong. But I’m also excited. I’m looking forward to being in a new place with just me and my cat and existing without someone telling me I’m doing it all wrong. Part of me keeps worrying I’m overreacting or making a huge mistake, but one of the messages I was sent here has helped me see things clearly—if my best friend came to me with this exact story, what would I tell her? Would I say she should stay and keep trying, or would I tell her to run?

Long story short, I would tell her to run.

I’ll update again once I’m out and settled, but for now, I just wanted to let you guys know what was going on and thank you again for all the support you’ve shown me. For too long, I’ve accepted this treatment because I thought it was normal, but it’s not. And I won’t be taking it anymore.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brann vs. Fenerbahçe: A Rain-Slicked Saga of Survival and Supremacy**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of two teams: SK Brann, the Norse underdogs braving Bergen’s biblical downpour, and Fenerbahçe, the Turkish titans who’ve probably never seen a puddle deeper than their own egos. Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and find the best same-game parlay in this Europa League clash.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: When Gods of Probability Weigh In

The numbers scream Fenerbahçe’s dominance. Most bookmakers price them at **1.36 decimal odds** (≈73.5% implied probability) to win, while Brann’s long shot sits at **7.0** (≈14.3%). Even the draw, at **4.75** (≈21.1%), feels like a mercy concession. But here’s the twist: the **Over 3.5 goals** line hovers around **1.8** (≈55.5% implied), suggesting bookmakers expect a wet, wild match.

Why? The **heavy rain** in Bergen (8–10°C, with the chill of a thousand scorned Vikings) could turn the pitch into a Slip ‘N Slide. Fenerbahçe’s coach, Domenico Tedesco, claims his squad is “ready,” but even the most polished Turkish coffee can’t steady legs on a quagmire. Brann, meanwhile, has **nothing to lose**—and in soccer, that often translates to reckless, beautiful chaos.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Rain, Rhetoric, and Ragnarök

Fenerbahçe’s presser was all confidence, no caveats: “We want to win. Giving 100% is crucial.” Translation: *We’ll win, but please don’t make us score with our toes in this muck.* Brann’s motivation? To avoid becoming the latest victim in the Europa League’s “Club of the Month: How to Lose 8 Points and Count.”

Injuries? None reported. But let’s imagine a few for comedic effect:

* **Brann’s striker** tripped over his own waterlogged socks in practice. *“It was like wrestling a soggy sock monster,”* he said.
* \*\*Fenerbahçe’s mid

Now imagine that for just one second… the person staring back isn’t you anymore.

I didn’t think that was possible either, until the mirrors in my apartment stopped behaving like one.  
I’m hoping someone here has seen anything like this before, because I really don’t want to be the only person going through it.  
I need someone who actually understands what’s happening.  
Something in my apartment’s mirrors isn’t acting the way it should.

Before you think I’m joking or sleep deprived, let me explain how this started.  
And to do that, I need to tell you a little bit more about me and where I live.

My name is Seth Morrow. I live in a small rental apartment on the edge of Asheville, North Carolina, an old brick building that creaks when the temperature changes and smells faintly of pine from the forest behind it. It’s a small one bedroom, living room in the front, a narrow kitchen off to the side, and a short hallway that leads to the bathroom and the bedroom at the end. I moved in two months ago to be closer to work. The place isn’t perfect, but it’s quiet, and quiet felt good.

Or it did.

I didn’t pick Asheville because it was peaceful. I picked it because it was practical. My old commute was killing my evenings, and when a colleague mentioned an open unit on the edge of town, close to work, next to a trail network, I took it. I’ve never been picky about where I live. Four walls, hot water, somewhere to put my keys. That’s usually enough.

Those first few weeks felt normal in the best possible way. Wake up, coffee, shower, work. Come home, heat something from the freezer, watch a bit of TV, try to sleep.

On weekends, I’d sometimes take a short walk on the forest path behind the building. The air smelled cleaner there. Sharper. A little resinous. Pine, probably. Sometimes I’d take the car out instead and drive down to Hendersonville to see my family for a few hours. It was only a short trip, an easy excuse to get out of the apartment. And on quieter nights, the breeze coming off the trees would drift right through my open windows. It reminded me that life doesn’t need much to feel calm.

I had no warning that anything was wrong.

Just small things at first, nothing dramatic, nothing anyone would think twice about. A creak in the pipes, the fridge humming unevenly, the soft scrape of my upstairs neighbor dragging a chair. The sort of sounds old buildings make to remind you they’re alive.

I settled into a routine. At work I handled inventory for a small outdoor gear shop downtown, a job that requires quiet focus but not much conversation. Still, I got along with most people there. Especially Evan.

He was new too. Started a week after I moved. Friendly in a low key way. He’d laugh at the same dumb things I laughed at during stocking shifts. We’d sometimes grab a sandwich from the café across the street before heading home.

Nothing deep. Just a decent coworker becoming a decent friend.  
The point is, life was boring in a comfortable way. Normal, predictable.

Then the mirror incidents began.

The first incident was small enough. I was brushing my teeth before work, half awake, leaning toward the bathroom mirror. As I spat into the sink, I saw my reflection blink. Nothing strange about that, except I hadn’t blinked. Not yet. Mine followed half a second later.

I stared at myself. Maybe I misread it. Maybe I blinked without noticing. Morning fog in the brain, nothing dramatic. I finished getting ready and left it alone.

At work that day, the incident kept creeping in my brain. Not obsessively, just the kind of thought that returns every few hours like an itch. I tried describing it to myself in plain terms. Maybe you twitched. Maybe it was your peripheral vision. Maybe you’re tired.

But the rhythm of it kept replaying in my head. A blink is such a simple action. You don’t forget the timing of it.  
I didn’t tell anyone. Didn’t want to sound ridiculous obviously.

That weekend, I tried to forget about it. I slept in, made coffee, tried to treat it like any other slow morning. But when I walked past the bathroom door, something made me glance at the mirror again. Not to check, just a passing look.

My reflection wasn’t doing anything strange. No blinking, no delay. But its posture caught my attention. I was mid step, turning slightly toward the kitchen. In the mirror, I looked like I’d already finished the turn. A fraction ahead of me.

The difference was tiny. The kind of thing you could blame on angle or motion blur. But it didn’t feel like that. It felt deliberate. Like it adjusted before I did.

I stood there for a few seconds, testing small movements, tilting my head, shifting my shoulders. Everything lined up perfectly again, as if it had corrected itself the moment I paused.

I told myself it was nothing. Just weekend grogginess. But the oddness followed me the rest of the day, sitting at the back of my mind like a misplaced word I couldn’t stop searching for.

A couple days later, it happened again while I was combing my hair before work. I leaned closer to the mirror to fix the back and caught the movement in the corner of my eye. My reflection straightened a fraction earlier than I did. It was subtle, but unmistakable.

I blamed the warped mirror. The building is old, the glass probably bowed or uneven. Refraction does odd things sometimes. I even took the mirror off the wall to check the backing. A metal plate, solid, undamaged. I wiped it down, remounted it, and tried not to think about it again.

It stuck with me this time. At work I felt off balance all day. I kept glancing at the small mirror mounted behind the register, checking it every time I passed. Nothing strange happened, which only made me feel more self conscious.

Eventually, during lunch, I mentioned it to Evan. Not in a dramatic way, more like a random complaint.  
“Hey, weird question,” I said. “Do mirrors ever lag?”

He looked up from his sandwich. “Lag?”  
I replied in a thoughtful manner, “You know… you move, and the reflection looks a little off?”  
He snorted. “Sounds like your apartment’s haunted!”  
I rolled my eyes. “Yeah. Okay!”

He softened and said, “Seriously though, old glass does that. Especially the really old stuff. Before they used float glass manufacturing, the sheets were never perfectly flat. You’d get these tiny waves in the surface that made reflections look stretched or slightly delayed. My grandmother’s house had a couple of those antique mirrors. If you moved even a little, the reflection sort of bent. Nothing lined up right.”

I raised an eyebrow. “When did you become an expert on glass?”  
He smiled. “I’m not. I just grew up in a house full of old, uneven things.”

It made sense. Enough sense that I let myself lean on that explanation.  
For a day or two.

But once you notice a pattern, your mind refuses to let it stay quiet.

The next morning I tested it deliberately. I raised my hand slowly toward the mirror. My reflection moved with me, until, just before my hand reached the glass, the reflected hand paused, as if unsure how close it should be. Only for an instant. But the pause was real. It felt like someone trying to match timing and missing by a fraction.

I told myself I needed more sleep.

That day at work I didn’t bring it up again. But Evan noticed I was quieter.  
“You good?” he asked while restocking headlamps.  
“Just tired,” I said.

He nodded, not prying. One reason we got along, he kept things simple.

But as the day went on, I kept replaying the mirror’s hesitation. The tiny pause. The strange uncertainty in my own reflection. It wasn’t dramatic. It was too controlled for that.  
That was what bothered me most. It felt intentional.

For the next week I avoided the bathroom mirror as much as I could. In fact I covered it with a bath towel so I wouldn’t have to look at it even by mistake. I shaved using touch, splashing water by guesswork, anything to keep my eyes off the glass. It made me feel ridiculous, but something about facing my reflection directly made my throat tighten, even if nothing dramatic happened. It wasn’t fear. It was the sense that I was being watched back.

During that week, little things shifted.  
I started leaving earlier for work just to avoid looking in the mirror. I started brushing my teeth leaning away from the sink. I’d bump into corners, misplace objects.  
And I felt stupid. Completely stupid.

That’s what pushed me to act.

On Monday, my first real chance after a weekend of fussing, I asked Evan after closing if he could swing by the apartment. “Just to check something,” I said, trying not to sound embarrassed.  
He raised a brow. “Something wrong?”  
“I just want another pair of eyes.”  
He agreed.

We drove over together after grabbing dinner. Asheville nightlife hummed faintly in the distance, but the forested edge of my building was quiet. My place smelled like dust and faint pine.

I walked him to the bathroom, peeled off the towel I’d draped over the mirror earlier, and waited.

“Okay,” he said. “What am I looking for?”  
“I don’t know,” I said honestly.

He stared at our reflections for a good minute. Made faces. Raised eyebrows. Tilted his head left and right.

“Well,” he said finally. “It’s a mirror.”  
“No lag? No weird movement?” I asked.  
“Looks normal to me.”

He patted my shoulder. “You probably scared yourself the first time. Happens.”

I tried to believe him. I wanted to.

He stayed for a beer, joked about how I owed him for “ghost inspection duty,” and left around nine. As he pulled out of the parking lot, he stuck his head out the window and yelled,  
“If the mirror eats you, I get your camping gear!”

I laughed. A real laugh, not forced.

When his taillights disappeared around the corner, the apartment felt different again. The silence wasn’t peaceful this time. It sat in the rooms like something waiting for me to acknowledge it. Even the familiar creaks of the building seemed muted, as if the place were holding its breath.

I tried to shake it off. Made a cup of tea. Put on a show I’d seen a dozen times. Anything to let the normal rhythm of the night settle back in. For a little while, it helped. I even started convincing myself that Evan was right, that I’d just worked myself into a corner over nothing.

But the reassurance didn’t last. Every time I moved past the bathroom doorway, the mirror caught my attention in a way I couldn’t explain. A quiet pull in the back of my mind, like the room was waiting for me to look again.

Eventually I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

I went back into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror, relaxed my shoulders, and simply breathed. Slow in, slow out. My reflection did the same. Perfectly synchronized.

Good.  
I felt silly for worrying.

Then I exhaled sharply, just once.  
To my utter shock, the reflection, however, exhaled twice.

I stepped back so fast I hit the counter behind me. The reflection stepped back at the same moment, not mirroring my movement, but copying the speed, like a partner in a dance who had finally learned the routine. There was no expression on its face beyond my own. Just… how do I explain this? Timing. Timing that didn’t belong to me.

For the first time, I understood what was happening. It wasn’t imitating me. It was learning me.

I covered the bathroom mirror immediately. This time with printer paper and packing tape, a crude barrier, but it felt like doing something. It rustled faintly as the adhesive settled, but after that the apartment grew quiet again.

The rest of the night blurred into a mess of pacing between the bathroom and the kitchen, trying to make sense of anything. My mind kept telling me what Evan told me, old glass, weird angles, sleep deprivation. But the moment of the double exhale replayed in my head over and over, clear as if it were still happening. There had been no mistake. No optical illusion. It had responded. Twice.

Eventually the exhaustion caught up with me. I lay down without meaning to, still fully dressed, telling myself I’d just rest my eyes for a minute. I don’t think I was asleep for more than five minutes when I woke to a soft sound.

A dry crinkle. Paper shifting. Not peeling, just moving, as if something brushed lightly against the surface from behind.

I held my breath and listened. Another sound. A subtle push from the backside of the taped mirror. Then stillness.

I didn’t sleep again after that. I sat on the edge of the bed and waited for morning like a kid waiting for thunder to stop. My thoughts kept stuttering in short, uncomfortable loops, never settling on anything for more than a second. I kept reaching for my phone, thinking I should call Evan, just to hear somebody awake on the other end. But what was I supposed to tell him? That my bathroom mirror was practicing how to push? Even imagining the words made me put the phone back down.

And I didn’t dare go into the bathroom.

The doorway was right there, only a few feet from the bed, a darker rectangle in the dim room. Even without seeing the mirror itself, the idea of that taped paper shifting again made my stomach twist. I kept my eyes on the doorway, afraid that if I looked away, something else might happen in the space I wasn’t watching.

I gave myself another safe and tired suggestion. It was the building settling, the paper reacting to humidity. I stayed in bed until morning light crept through the blinds. Only then did I get up and approach the bathroom. The paper covering the mirror bulged outward slightly in one rounded spot, no bigger than the heel of a hand. When I pressed it gently, it flattened like normal paper. Nothing behind it. No hole. No intruder.

By now, nothing felt normal to me. I went to work in a daze. Evan noticed.  
“You look awful,” he said.  
“Didn’t sleep.”

He hesitated. “Is this about the mirror?”  
I nodded.

He looked at me carefully. “What happened after I left?”

I tried to answer, but the words stuck for a second. “It… did something weird,” I said finally.  
“Weird how?”

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling stupid even before I spoke. “I went to check it again later. And when I breathed out, it…” I stopped, searching for the right phrasing. “It breathed twice.”

Evan blinked slowly. He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sure he’d heard me right either.  
“Twice?”  
“Yeah.” I exhaled once, showing him. “I did that. And the reflection did it twice. Not at the same time. Not synced. Just…” I shrugged helplessly. “Wrong.”

He studied my face, trying to read whether I was joking or exhausted past sense. “And you’re sure you weren’t imagining it?”  
“I know what I saw,” I said quietly. “I covered the mirror right after.”

Evan nodded, polite and cautious, the kind of nod people give when they want to be supportive but not quite sold on the story. “Okay. Well… you probably overwhelmed yourself yesterday. It happens.”

I didn’t argue. I just nodded back.

He sighed. “You need to get someone qualified to check that place out. Maintenance, landlord, someone.”  
“I don’t think this is a maintenance thing,” I said, a little sharper than I meant to.

Evan’s expression shifted, not annoyed, just concerned. “You’re scaring yourself, man.”  
He wasn’t wrong. But he wasn’t right, either.

That day after I returned from work, I covered every mirror in the apartment, the hallway mirror, the mirrored closet door, even the small utility mirror I kept in a kitchen drawer. I taped them until each one was nothing but a blank white surface. If the entity needed a reflective surface to appear, then I’d give it nothing to use.

For the next couple of days, the apartment stayed silent.

The silence didn’t comfort me. It just made me hyper aware of every small shift in the apartment.  
The hum of the fridge.  
The tick of the baseboard heater.  
Wind moving through the trees outside.

I checked the taped mirrors multiple times a day.  
The paper stayed unmoved.  
I almost convinced myself I’d imagined everything.  
Almost.

At work just two days after the breathing incident, while stocking gear, I walked past the small mirror mounted near the fitting area. For a second my reflection looked normal, tired, but normal. But when I bent down to pick up a box, the reflection straightened a split second before I did. Just a fraction too early. Just enough to make me flinch.

I pretended I didn’t see it.  
I finished my shift with my eyes anywhere but mirrors.

Later, in the car, I caught myself in the rearview mirror. Not staring, just a glance, a normal glance. But the reflection held my eyes a split second longer than I held its. I jerked the mirror upward so it pointed at the ceiling and drove the rest of the way home with my throat tightening every time headlights passed behind me.

By the time I pulled into my parking spot, I was shaking.

I kept telling myself I was tired.  
Stressed.  
Losing my grip.  
Anything but the truth I didn’t want to name.

That night, the sounds began again.

First the bathroom.  
A gentle flex of taped paper.  
Then the hallway mirror.  
A second soft push.  
Then the bedroom closet.  
A third, slightly longer.

Each one independent.  
Each one slow.  
Each one deliberate.

Not tapping. Not knocking.  
Just the quiet movement of something learning how to push, not with force, but with control.

I stood in the dark hallway, listening to the shifting paper. None of the mirrors showed anything through the tape, but the sound alone told me enough. Whatever lived in the reflections hadn’t stopped when I covered the mirrors. It had simply continued practicing out of sight.

As I write this now, the apartment is silent again. But I keep thinking about the first mirror I covered, the bathroom one. That was the earliest surface the entity had access to. The place where it first learned to blink out of sync, then breathe out of sync, then move out of sync.

If it started in that mirror, then that’s where it’s strongest.

And that mirror is only six feet from where I’m sitting, close enough that I can hear every small shift whether I want to or not.

I’m afraid to take the tape down.  
I’m also afraid to leave it on.

Because if the paper ever starts to move in a shape I recognize, that means it isn’t practicing anymore.  
It means it’s ready.

I keep staring at the bathroom door now, waiting for the next sound.  
Waiting for the next shift in the paper.  
Waiting for something I don’t know how to stop.

Part of me wants to move out tonight.  
Part of me fears whatever lives in those mirrors isn’t tied to the apartment at all.

I don’t know what to do anymore.

I work full time, while he studies at a local university. He enjoys hosting company and friends, while I typically do not as much. We’ve had arguments about it in the past and have agreed that, to have company over (especially late at night), we both need to discuss it and agree to it first so that it doesn’t interfere with our routines. There have been several instances where I come home from work late and exhausted just to find him and his friends several bottles of wine deep, and they don’t leave until midnight or later. Despite our agreements about it, it still feels like he doesn’t respect my boundaries. Yesterday afternoon, while I was recovering from a fever, he tells me “my sister and her bf are coming over, and I’m also supposed to hang out with our neighbor tonight. They’re on their way, they’ll be here in 45 minutes. Is that okay?” Fast forward to midnight, and company is still here. When they expressed their need to leave, my bf told them to stay, and did the ‘Midwest goodbye’ until 1:30 in the morning. By the time everything was cleaned up and I was ready for bed, it was 3 am. My wake up time is 6am, and now I am rushing to work because I missed my alarm. 

Unrelated, but still related, I have a cheap sewing kit with all the basic tools. Since we moved in together, parts from my nail kit, toolbox, gardening kit, etc. have been disappearing. We are both treated for symptoms of ADHD; his symptoms result in him not putting things away after using them, my symptoms result in me obsessively compulsively keeping sets together. It might be silly, but some of these cheap sets have been complete with me for years. When I got this sewing kit, I made it 100% clear to him that he is not to use it. That way, I’d keep all the pieces together, and if something did get lost, I wouldn’t be upset with him. Last night, while company was over, I noticed him picking at something with a needle before setting the needle down on the coffee table. “Is that from my sewing kit?” I asked. He gave me a side glance as if to say “wouldn’t you like to know.” He never put the needle away; I found it the next morning to return it to my nail kit, which was left wide open for our cats to get into. 

This morning, when I confronted him about having company over late again, he told me I was just trying to blame him for missing my alarm, and that he didn’t know that company was going to stay late anyway. Plus, he told me they were coming over beforehand. He also mentioned that I could’ve gone to bed at any time. When I asked him why he took something from my sewing kit, he said “but I told you I did!” When I assured him that he told me no such thing, he told me “okay but I put it away after.” To which I reminded him that I actually put it away. “What does the sewing kit have to do with anything? You’re just looking for another thing to be mad at.” 

I currently feel dismissed, disrespected, and unheard. 

How can I approach the follow up conversation in a way that encourages us to listen to one another and change our behavior, and not just argue back and forth? 

TLDR: Feels like partner is stepping on my previously established boundaries regarding guests and personal property. When I try to stand up for myself, it feels like it goes nowhere. ",0,1765483240.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

When one is walking down Boylston Street near the Prudential, they are likely to come across the eyesore known as the Tesla dealership. All of us cringe at the thought of Elon Musk and his oddly-shaped electric automobiles. That is why the dealership must be converted into a Waffle House.

For those who have not regularly traveled to the Southeast United States and experienced the ecstasy of Waffle House, I will provide a brief explanation. Imagine it is 2am, and you just finished partying, and now you're hungry. But oh no! Everything is closed! It's 2am! You cannot possibly go home and make my own food!! What are you ever going to do?!?!? But wait! Waffle House is here to save your evening. Open 24 hours a day, this chain serves okay waffles, eggs, bacon and coffee. Although not Michelin Star quality, it hits different between the hours of 9pm and 6am. Waffle House is often dinner and a show too. You might see the server or grill cook yelling at a drunk person, people get into a fight, or, if you're lucky, you could even see a WWE-style chair throw. 

So why should we replace the Tesla Dealership with the glorious institution of a Waffle House? Firstly, the nearest Waffle House to Boston is in the middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania. This means that the Waffle House will become a massive tourist attraction. Additionally, Waffle House tastes exponentially better when under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. With Boston being a college town with plenty of alcohol and weed, the Waffle House is bound to be a hit. Lastly, it is open 24 hours per day, meaning the party doesn't end when the T stops running for the evening. 

So, sign this petition to kill two birds with one stone: crushing facist Tesla and getting okay-quality waffles in Boston.",69,1765483140.0,boston,17,0.81,False

1pk7a2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pk7a2j/friendzoned_or_slowly_building_relationship/,Friendzoned or Slowly Building Relationship,"Forgive my long story but I could use some impartial advice. I'm a 45M and was married for almost 20 years and divorced 4 years ago. I've done a ton of emotional healing and am in a great place but haven't been able to find someone. 1.5 months ago, I met a 38F at a weekly outdoor music venue where she works. She just moved to the area and she gave me the impression that she was escaping a bad situation and looking to restart her life. We connected over photography and she gave me her Instagram and we messaged back and forth a little. 

A week later, I messaged her and asked if she wanted me to show her some scenic historic places in the area and she asked if I was asking her on a romantic date. I said ""I am. I'd like to get to know you better, if that's too much or you aren't interested in that way, you can let me know. I'm a big boy and I can take it and would still like to be friends."" 
She said ""Ok, thanks for this, I wanted to ask because I’d like to make friends but I’m not ready for dates yet. I’d still be down for an adventure if that’s ok with you 🤗""
I said ""I can totally understand that and appreciate you being upfront and honest!""

I showed her around for a couple of hours and then we went kayaking together. We had lots of deep conversations and she shared a lot about herself and asked me the same. She was super appreciative at the end, we hugged and parted but then we texted back and forth all night. Great banter, humor, fun.

I saw her again at the music venue and we hugged and she came and sat next to me on her break. 

Next, she invited me to meet her at a coffee shop where we talked for 3 hours and then went across the street and had pizza together. 

Between meetings we don't talk and it's minimal texting between events from this point on. I'll initiate a message and she'll respond but it rarely turns into back and forth banter, then a few days to a week will pass and I'll reinitiate and it's pretty much the same. Not short, 1-word responses, but not multiple sentences either.

Another music venue and she sat next to me for longer and asked me to walk her to her car at the end. I know this may have been an opening for me to do something but we hugged and I didn't get a sense that she wanted anything else so I didn't try to kiss her or anything. 

Next we were going to watch the sunset on my dock after I worked at my church's food pantry but when she found out about that she wanted to do it. So we did that and mostly worked apart from each other. We were both tired at the end and didn't end up hanging out. 

Then she went out of town for two weeks. 


Last night we hung out at the music venue again but it again ended with me walking her to her car and hugging. 

Today, we hiked for two hours on a trail. It is her birthday so I jokingly put some candles in a 6-pack of pecan swirls and greeted her with that when she arrived. She seemed to love it. Again great convo and lots of appreciation for taking her and a hug before we part. 

Do you think:
A) I've been friend-zoned. She sees me as someone to hang out with because she doesn't have a lot of friends here.

B) She has feelings for me and is just not ready to move forward. I should keep being a warm, supportive person and leave it to her to come around in her own time.

C) I've given her enough time and I should ask her on a real date and see how she truly feels.",1,1765483066.0,dating_advice,1,0.99,False

By no chance, I mean women that you are interested in, but they already have a boyfriend or are not interested in dating you. When it comes to relationship advice, a lot of people say that you can still be friends with them. That way you can practise talking to women and widen your social circle. If they approve of you, they may introduce you to others.

Personally, if think this is shit advice. If you are interested in her but she already has a boyfriend, befriending her anyway is quite predatory. You are trying to make her change her mind or worse, waiting for them to break up so you can try again. Imagine you were her boyfriend, you wouldn't want a guy who likes her to be around her right? I think this is unfair to everyone, you, her and her boyfriend. The other case, if she is not interested in you, then why bother be her friends?

A while ago, I briefly flirted with a woman in my university coffee shop and gave her my number. We texted for a while, then when I asked her out for a date, she said she has a boyfriend so happy to be a friend, but not a date. I stopped texting her since. I also have crushes on a few classmates at uni. After gauging their interest for a couple of times, I figured out they have absolutely zero interest in myself, so I don't try to befriend them now.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Panathinaikos vs. Viktoria Plzeň: A Europa League Clash of Cards, Chaos, and (Possibly) Divine Intervention**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. Panathinaikos is the favorite here, with odds hovering around **2.1 to 2.2** (implying a **47-50% chance to win**), while Viktoria Plzeň is a **3.4 to 3.6 underdog** (28-30% implied probability). The draw? A **3.1 to 3.4** shot (30-32%), which is oddly generous for a match where both teams are fighting for survival. But here’s the twist: Panathinaikos’ recent form is as inconsistent as a sleep-deprived barista—unbeaten in six of seven matches, but also prone to last-minute collapses (see: that 99th-minute equalizer against AEL Novibet). Plzeň, meanwhile, has the heart of a lion and the luck of a sieve: three losses in four domestic games, but a Europa League record that’s somehow *respectable* (2-3-0).

The key stat? **Panathinaikos’ home record**. They’re a Greek god of football at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, and not just because of the name. They’ve scored six Europa League goals at home this season and conceded… two. Meanwhile, Plzeň’s defense looks like a sieve that’s been challenged by a toddler’s art project. Their last three games? Three losses, including a 3-0 drubbing to Slovacko.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Motivation, and a Manager Named Rafael Benítez**  
Panathinaikos’ manager, **Rafael Benítez**, is a tactical wizard who once turned Liverpool into a Champions League contender. But let’s be real: his presence is less “strategic genius” and more “football’s version of a cursed coffee table—unpredictable and occasionally dangerous.” The team’s star players?

# ChatGPT said:

""Here’s a polished narrative setup you can use as a **story bible / back-cover concept / series pitch** for *Riders of Sombras*. If you want, I can expand this into a full outline, character sheets, opening chapters, or worldbuilding notes.

# Riders of Sombras — Series Overview

# Book One: The Shattered Veil

**Bastet of Nazca**  
A 28-year-old fae general with ebony skin, long silver hair, and sharp green eyes, **Bastet** rose through the ranks on pure discipline and tactical brilliance. Though modest in background—raised by her warm, pragmatic parents **Nikita and Hugo** alongside two older sisters, **Maya** and **Tia**—she earned her place as the youngest General in centuries. Her partner in the sky is **Paloma**, a powerful chestnut pegasus built like a winged Suffolk Punch: muscular, loyal, grounded.

**Wiremu of the Royal Line**  
At 30, **Wiremu** is both prince and anomaly: half-fae, half-lycan, with light olive skin, dark auburn hair streaked with predator-bright red, and hazel eyes that shift in hue with emotion and moonlight. Fierce but thoughtful, he rides **Lobo**, a commanding black pegasus with Warlander lines—elegant, strong, bred for battle. Wiremu stands between an older brother groomed for the throne and a younger sister who believes traditions must break for Nazca to survive.

# Inciting Conflict

Nazca—a kingdom sustained by its own **living magic**, woven through land, sky, and spirit—is being drained. Forests dull. Leylines stutter. Pegasus flights weaken.

The attacker is **Diablo**, a warlock of unknown origin whose magic is all corruption and hunger. His power grows not by conjuring but by **stealing**, siphoning Nazca’s natural essence for a larger, hidden purpose.

The Royal Council pairs the unlikely duo—General Bastet and Prince Wiremu—to investigate the source. Their partnership is strategic… and deeply inconvenient. He is impulsive where she is disciplined. She guards her emotions while he reveals too much. Yet when disaster strikes, they are the only ones who can meet it from land and sky alike.

# The Journey

As Bastet and Wiremu navigate fae ruins, lycan territories, and mountain temples older than memory, their uneasy alliance shifts into trust—then into something far more dangerous.

They uncover evidence that Diablo is not simply attacking Nazca… he is **claiming a birthright** that was stolen from him long ago.

The truth forces them to question:

* Who first bound Nazca’s magic to the land?
* Why does Diablo believe it belongs to him?
* And what did the ancient rulers erase from the history books?

The answers lie beneath Nazca’s capital, sealed behind a spell so powerful it rewrote the royal bloodline. When Bastet and Wiremu break it open, they make a discovery that shakes Nazca’s identity—and threatens to fracture the kingdom from within.

# Book One Ending (High-Level, Spoiler-Free)

Bastet and Wiremu unravel the hidden origin of Nazca’s magic and Diablo’s true motive. Their revelation forces them to choose between protecting the throne as it exists… or reshaping it to face what’s coming.

And in the final chapter, Diablo makes it clear:  
**He is not the enemy they should fear.**

# Book Two: The Moonbound Crown

Book Two shifts into:

# Political upheaval

The truth Bastet and Wiremu discovered destabilizes the royal family, ancient treaties, and the entire magical ecosystem.

# Deepening intimacy

Their partnership becomes emotionally and physically more entwined as they learn to navigate:

* their attraction
* their cultural differences
* their shared trauma from Book One
* the pressure of a kingdom on the brink

# A larger threat

Diablo’s attack was only the first move in a war stretching beyond Nazca’s borders. What he awakened is older than fae, older than lycans, older than the land itself.

My Situation:  
65, Overweight, night owl, drink coffee in the mornings, no drugs other than prescribed.  
Have a Trazodone prescription, doesn't really do much. Gets me to sleep, but doesn't keep me there. Tried melatonin, used to seem to work in my 40's but seems to do nothing now.   
Tried some Tommy Chong's ""nice dreams"" CBD tincture and it actually seemed to work, so I might try it again or maybe it was just a placebo effect.   
I usually get to sleep between 4AM and 6AM, sleep a maximum of around 4 or maybe 5 hours, and sometimes catch a late nap around 7PM.  
Note: I am self-employed so I am not trying to make my sleep fit any particular schedule,  just trying to get better, and longer sleep when I do.  
Treating this like an actual study instead of just complaining, I decided to try top get proactive and learn as much as I can here, and so OI have a couple of questions.   
  
1: What in your opinion, is the most effective sleep medication by prescription?  
2: What in your opinion is the most effective non-prescription sleep medication  
3: Do any of you use any of the exotic sleep apnea , or other high-sleep gadgets?   
4: Are there any (Aside from caffeine) dietary ""No-no's"" you stay away from?  
5: Have any of you ever participated in any sleep studies?

I’m fairly new to commodity brokering and wanted to get some real insight from people actually doing this.

I work between East Africa and buyers in the GCC/India/EU — mainly avocados, coffee, blueberries, herbs, etc. I’ve built a lot of supplier connections and I get steady leads, but only closed 1 deal.

One six-figure a month avocado deal was almost done and then collapsed last minute, which was a hit.

Before I keep pushing, I wanted to ask the community honestly:

Has anyone here actually made money as a commodity broker/middleman?
If yes:

How long did it take to close your first deal?

What made the difference between “lots of leads” and finally getting paid?

Any mistakes you’d warn beginners about?

1pk71mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforBetrayed/comments/1pk71mr/how_do_you_manage/,How do YOU manage?,"I left my cheating wife four months ago after discovering her sexting with an ex in June and then a full on physical affair in August that had been going on since February. This has been, without a doubt, one of the most brutal and traumatic experiences of my life. I am unable to go “no contact,” because we have a six-year-old. 

When I left, I moved out of our rented house into a tiny little apartment. We had prepaid our rent through October and she decided to stay in the house on her own through the end of the year. At some point, she noted that she was hoping the landlord would possibly lower the rent and throw her a lifeline, but that didn’t happen. She is now moving into a new flat not far from mine on January 1. 

Beginning with Thanksgiving, I began to have trouble sleeping again. In the immediate aftermath of discovering the affairs I didn’t eat or sleep for at least a few weeks if not months. 

Eventually that stabilized, and I felt like things were improving… I wasn’t “ok,” by any means - particularly since I have to interact regularly with the woman who blew up our lives, but i was surviving. 

Then, as the holidays have approached, each day has gotten harder and harder. There are some days where I can scarcely get out of bed. If my son is with me, obviously I manage it and get him off to school, etc. But my waking hours are filled mostly with sadness and, occasionally, anger. 

My brain still spins up on the “what?” “why?” and “how?” And the so-called “mind movies” have actually gotten worse recently since I know the “who.”

There have been days where I have thought of going to her AP’s work and catching off-guard at lunch and asking him to have coffee so I can finally get answers - what I know so far actually came from him when I called him from her phone on DDay - but as I was in shock, I don’t think I got the truth about everything and it kills me. 

As for my ex, she seems generally fine (though my son did say she cries a lot even when he’s there)…

She’s constantly bread-crumbing me. The landlord of our rented house offered me to move back in when she left, but I would’ve needed a roommate so I turned him down and when I did, she asked if I would move back in with her. I laughed. She texted me at one point, “maybe we’ll find a way back to each other.” I was like, “you must be fucking kidding me. You must be joking. You want me to forfeit my lease in this apartment move back into the house and live with you as a roommate on the off chance that you might figure your shit out and I would consider the possibility of starting up with you again… and if that never happened, then you started dating somebody else, having to move out again. Are you insane?”

She supposedly told a man who was pursuing her that we are “not done,” and has told me a number of times that she is only focusing on herself and our son and has no intention of dating anyone now. But I believe all of this is just to keep me in her orbit. Keep me around for emotional connection. 

We’re spending Christmas together for our son, and I will go with her up to her mother’s house. Her mother has fully sided with me in this separation by the way - she is almost as shocked by my wife’s behavior as I am and was.  

Anyway, if you got this far, thank you for reading. I could just use some support. Particularly from those who have been through this part of the process and come out the other side. 

I think for me, things are compounded by the fact that I live in a foreign country (my wife’s country) where I don’t speak the language and don’t have many friends. I have been, in the last few months, trying to be more social and get out more. I go to the gym, focus on work, and go to the movies and different local events, but obviously near the holidays, everything slows down and people retreat back to their families. I don’t have a family anymore… she took that from me. 

So… what did you do? How did you survive? Particularly if you found yourself still in love with a person who hurt you more than anyone else in your life?

I wish you all the best for the holiday season and beyond.

He never sexualized any talks, he respected me from the beginning, he was polite and always sharing super interesting things with me daily about his work and life in general. We finally met in person a couple of days ago and only when I met him in person, after a long walk in the park (3h of talking and walking) and initiating the second part of the date (we went to a coffee shop after the walk) has he told me that he is a father of two children… 
When I asked him why after so many messages has he never told me before he says “I thought you saw my profile on the dating app” (the profile only says that he doesn’t want anymore children… not that he already has kids…) I confronted him with that and he only replied that he thought that I knew…(???) and yesterday he tells me he’s true age (in the dating app he is 44 but now I know he is 46 making him 10 years older than me). I confront him with that and he only says that he already deleted de profile and that he can’t see what he selected on the dating app but that he is almost certain that both informations were accurate. Then I asked him if he was married and he replied “Yes I am… No! I’m kidding!” (Wtf…) He insisted in talking via telephone after some messages about this second misinformation that I noticed and he said he was sorry very short and shy and silent on the other side of the phone and that he didn’t want to disappoint someone like me that he was enjoying so much to talk to… and now, the day after, he is silent all day… probably will never talk to me again as so many others before…
What the hell is wrong with people with hiding basic information like this??

It started subtly with occasional hoarseness and a dry cough that I ignored at first, but then it ramped up to where I'd wake up in the middle of the night with a sour taste and burning sensation, making me obsess over every little symptom and Google way too much, which only made things worse.

Has anyone here had similar throat sensations that turned out to be reflux, and what specific signs helped you realize it wasn't something like cancer?

I tried changing my diet by cutting out coffee and fried foods, which helped a bit during the day, but the nighttime stuff persisted until I read about natural options like sodium alginate that forms a gel barrier to block acid and pepsin from coming up. After some digging, I found what seems like the [best alginate supplement](https://www.nutritist.us/blogs/blog-2/sodium-alginate-lpr-silent-reflux) with added bicarbonate and calcium to make it last longer, and studies from around 2021 showed it reduced issues like difficulty swallowing and coughing in people with silent reflux after using it for two months without any side effects.

Did you notice improvements in your symptoms after a few weeks of consistent use, or did it take the full course to feel a difference?

Even with that, my anxiety creeps back when symptoms flare, so I've been keeping a journal of triggers like stress or late meals to track patterns, and it's helped me feel more in control instead of panicking every time.

What daily habits have you added to manage both the reflux and the worry that comes with it, like specific breathing exercises or meal timing that actually stick?",2,1765482376.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

The bill came out to about $27 USD. My friend had a $6.70 coupon, so the total was roughly $20.30, which means each person’s share would’ve been around $6.70.

My friend offered to pay the bill and even said she’d cover our other friend too. Later, she told me I owed her $11 — significantly more than my portion should’ve been. I didn’t argue the math; I just told her straight up that I wasn’t going to send her such a tiny amount and would cover the next meal instead.

Important context: this is literally the first time she’s ever paid for my food. I’ve invited her for coffee and other small things in the past and never asked for repayment. So there’s no history of her financially carrying me. Also she makes decent money and still lives with her parents.

She completely flipped out, made a huge deal out of it, and even threatened to end our friendship over $11.

Now I’m wondering if I handled it wrong. I genuinely don’t mind paying what’s fair, but the amount was tiny and I fully intended to make it up by covering our next outing (which would’ve cost more anyway).

The Brookside Shops area could soon see a long-awaited improvement for trail-goers in Kansas City .  
  
Property owners in the district - which includes businesses like Foo's Fabulous Frozen Custard, HomeGrown restaurant, and The Roasterie coffee shop - have asked the city to approve the creation of a community improvement district for the area to fund upgrades to parts of the Trolley Track Trail and other projects.  
  
A CID is a special entity with a board that can levy a 1% sales tax in a certain area to help cover the costs of planned improvements within those boundaries.  
  
For Brookside, that would mean financial support for work to help beautify the area with new landscaping, signage, art, lighting and other improvements while making paths safer for pedestrians.  
  
The plan would also establish collaboration with the city and utilize city support through public improvements funding, known as PIAC, which is broadly geared toward neighborhood needs in each City Council district.  
  
That will mean the Trolley Track Trail will be better connected through the Brookside shopping area. Currently, the trail gets cut off at 62nd Terrace and users are forced onto sidewalks or through parking lots until the trail picks back up at Meyer Boulevard.  
  
The CID plan aims to connect the trail through the parking lot off 62nd Terrace and Brookside Plaza , meaning less of a cut off for trail users, and making parking improvements.  
  
Renderings show a concept for a central square that would serve as a gathering space along the trail alongside other aesthetic and infrastructure improvements.  
  
""To have them (area owners) put their money where their mouth is to create the CID and help us move that project forward is exciting to me,"" Jonathan Duncan , council member for the Sixth District , said at a hearing Tuesday.  
  
Eric Bunch , council member for the Fourth District , called the trail connection plan exciting and said the CID plan could be a model for the rest of the Trolley Trail corridor.  
  
The City Council will have final approval on the CID plan.",11,1765482202.0,kansascity,2,1.0,False

So last time we had Morel get a rude awakening to exactly what the coalition does to those who do not produce, and Luke had to show a bit of humanity to comfort her. Well, now it's time for the pair to get to some hard, sweaty work---something that will certainly get their hearts pounding ;P

\------

Before the first rooster’s cry, Luke stepped onto the porch and drew in the cool Montana air. The solar kites were high in the sky, floating in the distance like ancient floating islands from ancient tales of myth and fantasy.

Crossing the yard, Luke found the rabbits already waiting, just as they did for Morel.. They were in a perfect line, eagerly waiting to be released and fed. Their button eyes followed his every movement as he checked the traps and circumvented the yard. The ever-present watchers did not miss a single detail until the cage's door was opened and food overflowed from their pastel bowls.

Unlike Morel, the rabbits did not swarm Luke; they simply moved past him with hunger in their bellies. Save for one, Button. The little rabbit pranced right before Luke, stamped his feet in frustration, silently demanding an explanation for why Luke dared feed them and not Morel.

“Sorry, little guy, Morel is not awake yet,” Luke awkwardly apologized to the surprisingly sharp animal.

Button wiggled his nose and stamped a few more times before he sauntered off, going to join the others for breakfast.

As the little rabbits chomped on fresh grass and fruits, a little meow from nearby drew Luke’s attention. Seated proudly on the steps up to the porch was a particular little barn cat. Red fur, white shoes, and a haughty attitude are reserved only for Bastet herself.

The little kitten meowed and looked at Luke with demand. Luke shook his head and crossed the yard, reaching down to pet the little kitten. Like before, it purred and accepted all the affection without hesitation.

“Well, aren’t you just cute?” Luke cooed, the cat rolling over for belly scratches. “Why won’t you let Morel pet you, little girl? She is nice, and really wants to.”

The little cat ignored the question, not that it could understand him anyway. The little creature preferred to continue playing with Luke’s hand like it was one of its littermates. “I think I will call you Ember.”

Not long after Ember had gone belly up and was batting at Luke’s hand, Button, his rabbit-bodied soul partner —if Morel was correct—hopped over and made his physical needs known. He walked right up and stood over Ember, blocking Luke from the kitten.

Button looked up at Luke with as much annoyance as his little bunny face could display. Oh, fear the righteous fury of a bunny scorned.

But the stubborn little fuzzball had not realized he had just volunteered himself to be the kitten's new playmate. In an instant, Ember decided that since she could not play with Luke anymore, Button would have to do. Button quickly changed his attention to the cat swatting at his side and rolling around beneath them. He retreated across the yard, trying to escape the far more energetic creature, but she followed.

For each step Button took, Ember took five, closing the distance until she was atop Button once again. The pair tumbled as they collided, limbs flopping everywhere as they rolled around in the grass.

After wrestling for a few heartbeats, they separated. Ember rushed off toward the rabbit's house, with Button in hot pursuit. The pair then began playing what Luke could only describe as tag. One would chase the other around the rabbit house several times, and then they would switch roles.

There were many things Luke had expected to see at Golden Fields: broken farming drones, festered fields, and even angry locals. A rabbit and a kitten prancing about and playing together was not one of them. Luke expected them to avoid one another, but he supposed stranger things happened all the time around the wider galaxy. If a kitten and a bunny wanted to be friends, who was he to judge?

As Luke watched the two little ones play for dominance, the door opened behind him, rusted hinges creaking slightly. Morel stepped out, her usual working attire giving her that rugged charm Luke had begun to enjoy about her. She held two cups of coffee in her hand and heavy bags beneath her eyes.

“You are up early,” Morel yawned, holding out a cup for him.

“Yeah. I didn’t sleep well,” Luke replied, taking the warm mug.

“Something on your mind?” Morel asked, stepping up beside him and looking out at her bunnies. Her eyes drifted to Button and that barn cat playing; she ignored the feeling of betrayal welling in her heart. Why did that little cat play with both Luke and Button, but not her?

“Nothing important,” Luke lied.

He had already tucked his dream from last night deep in his mind. It was simply something he would rather not explore the meaning behind.

He dreamed about his ex-girlfriend somehow having found her way here and having the black hats drag him, clawing and screaming away, while the rest of their goon-squad beat Morel into a bloody pulp for daring to try and prevent the coalition's will.

The sounds of Jackie's demonic laughing echoed in his mind. He could remember the sight so vividly, as if it were a distant memory that had damaged his mind.

Jackie stood over Morel, kicking her face with high heels, cracking her horns, while berating her as a cheap replacement. Morel did not need to hear about that. She was too innocent a soul to know that he had dreamed of her demise at the hands of his ex.

“So are you almost ready to go?” Luke asked. “I packed the fencing tools and wood last night. If we start now, we should be able to get a lot of the fence done before noon.”

“After coffee?” Morel asked, gesturing toward the swinging bench attached to the patio roof.

“Sure,” Luke shrugged, following her to the bench to enjoy a pleasant, lazy morning watching the rabbits and the sunrise.

—-

Flexing what little amount of muscle Luke possessed, he hefted the fence crossbeam onto his shoulder. With shaking hands, he reached into his tool belt and extracted a long wood nail and a hammer. 

After struggling to line up the nail, he struck it fecklessly, each strike lacking the resolve to pierce the hard oak, with the nail only going in a smidge at a time. After ten mediocre hits, Morel chuckled and came to his side.

“Lemme, sug, just hold that beam,” Morel said, resting her hand atop his and the hammer, engulfing nearly the entire thing. 

Luke grumbled in frustration, but did not argue with her. This exact scenario had been happening repeatedly for the last four hours. They would start on an area of fencing that needed fixing, evenly splitting the work.

But with Morel’s size, the manual labor aspect just came easier. 

She would finish her half quickly and easily, capable of lifting the 100-pound beams with one hand and nailing them in place with ease. Seeing her work with such effort and grace was insane. 

Luke fundamentally understood that Morel and her entire species were stronger than all humans, except for the rarest genetic deformities on both sides of that equation; however, actually seeing it in effect was beyond words. 

In two swift hits, the six-inch nail was set, and she just looked over at Luke with a little taunting wink. “There sug, that ought to hold for a few years.”

“Yeah, it should,” Luke replied, standing up. “ Come on, let's get going to the next patch of the fence.” 

“Really another?” Morel groaned, shoving her hammer into her toolbelt and kicking a rock. The stone thwacked loudly off her polished hoof and then the support post of the fence. “I thought we were almost done.”

“Not quite,” Luke said, pulling up the map of the boundary on his data slate. “We still have another four areas to fix, and the main gate. This will take us most of the day.” 

That was not the answer Morel had wanted to hear. She loaded into the back of the truck, plopping down atop the pile of crossbeams. She opened a water bottle and slightly sulked, sipping from it. The ice-cold water was a great relief under the blazing sun.

Luke walked up beside the truck bed and leaned on it. “Look on the bright side. We only have to do this once, and then it's just basic maintenance.” 

“I suppose,” Morel replied, closing the bottle and tossing it into the cooler with their lunch, the half bottle slapping against the piles of sandwiches and snacks Morel had prepared after drinking her morning coffee. “Was it always this much work? I swear it was easier than this when I was younger.” 

“It’s about as difficult as I’ve always known farm work,” Luke replied. “But I would rather be doing this than being back at Olympus Mons.”

“Oh, why is that?” Morel asked, leaning on her knees and fluttering her ears, giving a devilish smile, and Luke a good look down her shirt. 

He looked away and realized that he had let his guard down a bit more around this woman again for reasons he could not understand. Sure, Morel was kind, easy on the eyes, and very hospitable. But that was no reason for him to be so lax around her. If he kept making those slips, it was only a matter of time before he was hurt again.

Wrangling his emotions under control, Luke rapidly changed the topic, trying to maintain a safe level of emotional distance.

""It's not important. Let's get back to work,"" Luke coughed into his hand and started toward the cab.

Entering it did not shield him from her prying as he had hoped. Once the truck was ambling along, barely faster than a walking pace along the fenceline, Morel opened the back window and carefully navigated her ivory horns through the small opening. 

“So, tell me, Luke. Why do you not want to be at Olympus Mons? I heard that school was amazing and a place everyone should try to attend.” 

“Can we not pull on that particular string?” Luke asked flatly, his eyes still scanning the fence for any damage he might have missed with the drone. 

Morel rolled her eyes, but did not pester him more about it. That part of his past obviously bugged him. So instead of digging into that, she decided to ask about something else. “What about your family?” 

“What about them?” Luke replied, slowing the truck to look at a post in closer detail. 

“Tell me about them.” 

“It’s nothing fun,” Luke replied, hoping Morel would let that topic die as well. 

“Come on, you know about my family. It’s only fair I learn a bit about yours.” Morel argued. 

“I still don’t know your mother's name. Nothing my old teacher sent me told me that.”

“My mom's name was Marmale,” Morel said, rolling onto her stomach on the wood and kicking her hooves in the air. She propped her head up, placing her elbows on the front seat's shoulders. “There, now you know that. So spill it.”

“Ugg, fine,” Luke grumbled, tossing his head to the air for a moment, not feeling comfortable with Morel enough to call her too stubborn for her own good. 

All logic dictated that she should not want to know about him, his past, or frankly anything regarding him other than that he was here to help. But for some reason Luke cannot comprehend that she keeps looking a gift horse in the mouth. 

It took him a few moments to organize his thoughts about what he should tell Morel. Most of his past was safe to divulge, but he had to doctor portions to avoid all mention of Jackie and their past. As far as Morel should know, Luke was just a man dedicated to his work with an uncaring family.

Once he had his story straight internally, Luke recounted it as he saw it —a boring tale. One that had little pomp or flair. It was just the story of a man who never lived up to familial expectations.

He was raised on Mars by the family servants from almost his birth; he had seen some pictures of himself as a newborn swaddled by his mother, but no actual memories of such a familial warmth.

His father and Mother had little time for any of their loins-fruit. As the fourth of seven children, he was especially low on their list of importance.

His parents' time was better spent managing Stephens Cultivation Corporation. 

With that multitrillion-chit company needing their full attention, their children were little more than chess pieces to be gambled with and played in the politics of that *oh-so-polite* society. 

For Luke, life was the predictable expectation of a man raised under the weight of expectation. He worked hard, went to college, and participated in every extracurricular, allowing the air of no less than a dozen worlds to pass through his lungs as he aligned his travels through the stars. 

“Well, that’s the long and short of it,” Luke finished, turning the wheel to carefully thread the needle over a particularly tight wooden bridge at the property's boundary. 

The path before them was well wooded, offering cover from the winds and blistering sun of the Montana sky. The chilling effect in the air was made even more prominent by the stream flowing into a small pond barely visible through the trees. 

Pulling the car up to the next set of broken fencing, nestled deep within the trees, Luke stopped and parked. 

“So is that why you studied agriculture?” Morel asked. 

“Yeah. It’s kinda a family business thing.” 

Morel tilted her head, opened her mouth to speak, but then stopped. She chewed on her thoughts for a moment before speaking again. “So did they ever, you know… notice your work?”

“No,” Luke replied with the same intensity as someone ordering coffee. What he said was just a matter of fact, one that would never change, no matter what he did.

Luke stepped out of the cab, walked straight to the fence line, and began his next inspection. The topic of his bitter past only worsened his mood, a shift Morel noted as she observed him for a moment.  

To those titans of industry, examples of what humans were in the coalition, he was not even a blip on the radar. All Luke was to dear old dad, and his *loving* mother was a prodigal son. He tried repeatedly, wasting their resources, but it never amounted to anything. 

He frustratingly ripped away a rotted wooden crossbeam while recalling how well the rest of his siblings were doing. His brothers and sisters had doctorates by twenty-four, owned their own corporation by twenty-five, and had significantly added to the family name long before graduating high school. 

Then there was Luke. He had barely scraped by through college. He had never received bad grades, but they were middling at best. Even his time working on other farms to help them recover was, as far as he was concerned, nothing to write home about. 

All he had ever done was help small farmers adjust their processes to withstand the demands the coalition placed upon them. His siblings were far more notable. Hell, they were minor celebrities, a few even had become politicians on Mars. Then there was Luke, running from his past and buried in yet another *meaningless farm* as his father so eloquently judged his line of work.

As Luke traced his hand across the decayed and damaged strut, Morel swung her legs out of the truckbed and spoke. “Well, I think you are wonderful,” Morel said, stepping down and retrieving the gear they would need to replace that post, and moving over to aid him. 

Replacing the post and the missing crossbeam here didn't take them long, but like at the other locations, once they started working, Luke was all business. They removed the old post, planted a new one, and attached the needed crossbeams with nails and wire, just as they had done with all the others. 

But Morel felt something was off. Luke was being sluggish now. She could tell that her questioning him brought up some bad memories. The heavy silence ate at her, making her gentle heart ache.

She just wanted to know who the man living with her was. There was no reason they had to be strangers, but every time she tried to pry him out of his shell, Luke pushed back.

He had only been here for two days, so Luke likely just needed more time to warm up to her. But having someone so close, yet who feels like they are a million light-years away, dug at her, making her feel slightly guilty for even trying.

By the time the work on this location was done, the sun had reached its zenith, and for Morel, that meant one thing: it was time to eat lunch, and she knew just the place for them to do so. 

As Luke loaded the last of his gear into the truck, Morel took up the cooler and teasingly flicked her tail against his back. “Come on, let’s go eat.”

Luke was about to protest, having turned back toward the cab to keep driving on, saying that they were barely halfway done with the work, but his stomach grumbled, shutting him down mid-thought.

From behind him, Morel snorted, stifling a giggle. ""Come on, you can't deny you are hungry.""

“I guess I should eat,” Luke admitted, turning around to follow Morel deeper into the woods, along a small unmarked game trail, leading them right toward the pond.

1pk6sll,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pk6sll,"AIO: Are my bf and I overreacting? Friends ended the friendship, shortly after making new friends.","I (24f) have been friends with this couple for a year almost 2. My bsf (20f)we’ll call her K, and her bf (19m) we’ll call him J. When I became friends with my bf (28m) we’ll call him C, I introduced them. They got along instantly. A little while later, C and I started dating and they were all here for it. We’ve always gone back and forth hanging out at each other’s apartments, occasional arguments mainly with them initiating each one (I have tons of screenshots to back this up so if needed i can post those in comments or when editing this if people wish to see those). A couple nights ago, we hung out at their place. They openly told us they made new friends, which really is no big deal, but awhile ago I introduced K to another friend of mine (we’ll call her H) and we were a trio, eventually they would hang out without me, post each other when I wouldn’t get posted (even tho I posted them all the time). Eventually I addressed that situation, and H is no longer a part of the picture. So, naturally, when K and J announced their newfound friends, I was a little weary about it, but I tried to remind myself that not all situations are the same. That night, when C and I went home, we FaceTimed our friend(A). K had left a sports bra at our apartment, and C put it on as a joke. He usually does this type of funny stuff and K and J always love it, so of course we both thought they’d get a laugh out of it, and sent a snap to the group chat. Instead of their usual reaction they always give, they were upset, saying he would stretch it out (it’s a sports bra, btw, even if it did stretch it’s an easy fix in the dryer). I apologized for sending the snap, explaining we thought it would be funny but that it would not happen again. C apologized the next day, even offering to pay her back for said bra. J came to pick the bra up, and then later called me saying it got stretched out. C again offered to pay her $50 (that’s what she said it cost, the bra was Calvin Klein btw idk if that matters but just in case). She had said she wasn’t gonna take the money, and C said a comment. For context, in past arguments they have threatened to end the friendship, take the stuff they gave us back, like the couch they gave me, or the coffee table they gave me. C drank some of their stuff without asking once, which he did apologize for, and they brought that up in this bra debacle, so C said “I’ll give you the money anyway because I don’t want this to be brought up in another argument.” I didn’t see the text, as I wasn’t on my phone at the time and was busy doing dishes, but C told me he sent that to the group chat where the whole conversation had taken place (i don’t have the screenshots of the conversation in the group chat tho unfortunately, they left and their messages are no longer in it, we left it after they did). Shortly after that, both K and J left the group chat and texted me (pics to show). One thought that ran through my mind was “what if they were looking for a reason to end the friendship because of their new friends?” One of them (T) does not like me. Keep in mind, she does not know me personally. My abuser and his family had spread rumors about me years ago when I spoke up about being abused by him, to try to keep me quiet. Since then, certain people believe that and without knowing me, do not like me. So it made me think that maybe because T doesn’t like me and would always give me “the stink eye” every time she saw me, they wanted a reason to call it quits. And this morning, there was a car outside my building. Pretty much everyone in my building has their own car, so I doubt they were picking someone up. I have been trying to find out who the car belongs to, but no luck with that. My intuition tells me it’s someone they know, but I could also be wrong.

1pk6j26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pk6j26/slowburn_connection_with_a_girl_in_my_friend_group/,Slow-burn connection with a girl in my friend group,"A few months ago I met a girl (21F) at a friend’s gathering. I’m a bit older (late 20s) and more established in my career, but we clicked instantly in a very warm, natural way. Nothing happened right away- at the time I wasn’t in the mindset for something serious, and she seemed shy and guarded.

Over the months, we kept bumping into each other at group events, mutual friends’ parties, and community things. Slowly, we started building this really wholesome dynamic. She’s naturally very gentle, quiet, and cautious with new people, but with me she’s consistently warm, playful, and soft.

Her close friend group has fully adopted me. They invite me to everything, they tease me, they hang out at my place for dinners, holiday parties, game nights, etc. Her sister even shared her location with me “so I don’t get lost getting to events,” which I took as a sign that they trust me deeply. They treat me like I’m already part of the circle.

And this girl, let’s call her Sarah, has been slowly opening up to me in ways that feel meaningful:

**Some signs from her:**

She gave me a silly little gift once (a funny looking stone and stickers) and got genuinely excited when I said I’d keep them and cherish them.

She’ll take my drink and sip from it without hesitation, and offers me bites of everything she’s eating; even spoon feeding me custard once.

She switches languages with me naturally depending on how I speak to her; it feels intimate and effortless.

She tells me about her childhood, her family, her fears, and even her “toxic traits.”

She rubs my arm or side when we hug, and lingers longer each time.

She sneaks candid pictures of me, and I’ve caught her taking selfies of us on my phone.

She asked what my deepest flaws are because “no one is perfect” and wanted to know the real me.

She confides in me when she’s homesick, stressed, or emotional, even though she’s usually private.

**Group dynamics:**

Her friends and siblings seem to be rooting for this.

They’ve invited me to multiple events: study nights, dance socials, movie nights, holidays, you name it. They always include me. They tease her and me together. Her sister once said something basically hinting “why don’t you two go hang out?”

Sarah seems safest in group settings; she warms up slowly one-on-one. Whenever either suggests the two of us do something together, she’ll say “as a group!” but the more we see each other, the more that hesitation is fading.

**Shared interests / effort:**

She loves a particular style of music/dance, so I secretly took a private lesson and went to a social event just to learn it. When I showed her the picture, she didn’t believe me at first because she thought I was being sarcastic and then got excited and said I was “crazy” for it haha. She lit up when she realized I really did it.

I recently went on a short trip for work to our native country and brought back some local pastries/sweets. Not a fancy gift, just something small, but I told her they were for her and her family. When she opened the box, she immediately reached out her arms for a hug and pressed her head against me. One of the warmest hugs we’ve shared.

**The big recent moment:**

Last weekend, a simple group stop turned into something that felt like a mini-date.

Her siblings were leaving early, and she said she didn’t want to be alone. I suggested we could go for a walk. We ended up wandering for almost 3 hours, watching the sunset together.

She sat with her body angled toward me. We joked, talked about life, childhood, relationships, fears, and dreams. At one point we were just quietly standing there, both looking at the view, and I realized I kept staring at her more than the scenery.

Afterward, we passed a cozy coffee shop and she suggested we go in. Then she raced me to the counter to pay, and she won. We shared a drink, talked about interests and longings, then walked back to her place.

 

When I left, she gave me a long, warm hug- the kind where neither person is in a rush to let go.

**Texting:**

We text lightly but warmly. Long conversations sprinkled throughout weeks. She initiates sometimes, especially check-ins. She switches into our native language without thinking. 

**The slow-burn tension:**

We haven’t been on an official 1:1 date yet. Partly because she’s shy, partly because I’ve been careful not to pressure her, and partly because the group setting has been our safe zone.

She travels soon for a couple months to visit family, and I’m scared of losing momentum. But I also feel like these feelings have become real, deep, and harder to ignore. I’ve never had this kind of slow, gentle build before and it’s making me overthink.

I’m starting to fall for her. I feel like she’s falling for me too, just very slowly and carefully. But I’m terrified of messing it up or misreading something.

**Does this sound romantic on her side?**

**How do I handle the slow pace without losing myself in the feelings?**

**Any advice from people who’ve navigated early slow-burn relationships?**",1,1765481291.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

First, I know there’s a lot of posts like these but I wanted to share my experience since it’s a bit different from what I can find through searches. A bit about me: 26F, 5’2” and have always been petite, like my entire adult life I’ve hovered around 85-95 pounds. That much is genetic, as my grandma also has a hard time putting on weight. Well, as you can guess, that means I historically live pretty sedentary and eat a lot of carbs especially pasta as it’s the one thing I always feel comfortable with eating. I also have moderate-severe ADHD which leads to decision fatigue around food (rarely if I can’t think of something that sounds palatable, I’ll consider it for hours and eventually just give up and go to bed), getting too focused on something else so I just forget food is a thing, and my least favorite thing is I have some aversions in terms of meat textures. I’ve also focused a lot on increasing water intake with minimal other drinks (coffee is a big one). 

In mid-November I saw my primary care doctor and she ordered annual lab work. The results came back and one of her staff called me last week. My A1C was 5.8, fasting glucose was 86, CHOL 205, TRIG 166, and LDL 139. I’m definitely considering this a wake up call and been joining all kinds of pages and groups to learn more about prediabetes in addition to changing diet (minimizing carbs and additional sugar, focusing on protein and veggies) and making an effort to walk more (I have a walking pad since I work from home and utilizing the incline function). I plan to start strength training/lifting soon once I can purchase equipment. 

Overall, just looking for suggestions/input whether good or bad. I will say I am on stimulant meds and prescribed vanilla ensures to drink in the mornings and when I need calories on hard days. I’ve seen people say those aren’t good for prediabetes and other conflicting info but I’m trying my best. Unfortunately this year has been whack all around: I’ve had two pets pass away in the past 6 weeks which racked up thousands in vet bills (luckily I have pet insurance), I got a new job that involves a lot of traveling, family and household issues, so it’s felt like every time I thought things would slow down or be okay, another crisis happened. I’ve seen where stress can impact blood sugar levels so I’m sure that’s been part of my case.

 I wanted to share a quick grounding technique that has saved my life when I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack or my anxiety is getting out of control.  I understand what it's like to be detached from the present moment by your thoughts being drawn into the future (""What if?"") or trapped in the past.





 The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique uses your five senses to anchor you in the ""now"" in order to reset your nervous system.  You can do it anywhere, and it takes about 60 seconds.



Here's how to do it precisely:



 Five Things You Observe:  List the five things you can see in your immediate surroundings.  Take note of the details; don't just look.





 Your coffee mug's color.



 the shadows' pattern on the wall.



 the form of the numbers on a clock.



4 Things You Hear: Pay attention to faint noises that you typically overlook.



 The refrigerator's hum.





 Outside, there was distant laughter.



 Your own breathing sound.





 3 Things You Touch: Pay attention to your body's feelings.



 Your shirt sleeve's texture.



 Your palms' warmth.



 The feel of your phone in your palm.

Two Things You Smell: Look for pleasant or neutral smells.



 freshly cleaned linens.





 The smell of your hand soap.





 1 Thing You Taste: Consciously savor something.



 Your toothpaste's minty taste.



 the aftertaste of your coffee or tea.

Why this helps: Chronic anxiety creates a disconnect between your mind (which is panicking) and your body (which is in the present). This disconnect fuels the panic. Grounding works because it forces you to focus on sensory reality rather than mental chatter, reminding your brain: ""I'm here. I'm safe."".







I’ve compiled a few of these quick techniques (like this one and Box Breathing) into a small set of ""calm cards"" that I keep on my phone for emergencies.



Give this a try next time you feel that wave of anxiety hitting. If this helped you, let me know in the comments—I'd love to hear what anchors you best.",2,1765481185.0,Stress,0,1.0,False

1pk6b41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1pk6b41/type_me_questionnaire/,Type me questionnaire,"Type, instincts, tritype, triads - anything you see. Very interested to hear everyone's reasoning.

1. What are your views on the good things in life? Do they happen naturally, or do you have to create them yourself？How do they manifest into reality?

All things naturally tend towards chaos, so you'll most likely get a mixed experience. Someone gifting you their ticket when you walk past a venue entrance because they just found out they can't go? Pure luck. But if it's something specific you really want, you have to actively pursue it, place yourself in the right environments, and give that thing a chance to align with you. The conditions you were born into also play a significant part in this. Depending on what you want for yourself, you might have to work harder and smarter if you don't get a head start.

2. What are your views on the bad things in life? What are the reasons they happen? How much control do you really have over such matters?

You can certainly carve out a path for yourself, but you have to stay focused and not give importance to what you don't want. You can't know everything before you try it, and making mistakes on the way is not an issue. If you're willing to fail and learn from experiences you can often get to your destination faster.

3. How attached are you to your emotions? How often do you express them to others? What even is the purpose of such feelings? And what are the biases that impede your judgements?

I'm attached to a mix of anticipation and surprise much more than the rest. I don't really mind negative emotions because experiencing the full specter feels more valuable. I express this to people, but not everyone gets access to the same things. It's not really about how close we are or how long we've known each other, it's more about the situation and what I know about them. Some people only hear about the good stuff, some predominantly about work, and more rarely about my struggles. I don't think anyone ever has the complete picture of what's going on in my life.

4. What do you want in life? Is it achievable? If people and obstacles are in your way, what would you do then? With resources being limited, is it ok to acquire essential needs by denying them to someone else?

To have a successful career, work on interesting and challenging projects with likeminded people, to be well-off, live in a beautiful place in a major city where there are many things going on every day. I don't see why it wouldn't be achievable. If other people can have it, so can I. I usually go around people and obstacles and find a new way to get the thing I want. Resources aren't limited (yet), they're badly distributed.

5. Are people inherently good or bad? Or is it neither? What do you believe when it comes to moral goodness? What duties do we all have as individuals?

People are naturally selfish. Morality is a slippery slope, especially when you try to apply your views to other people. Everyone should be able to express their opinions and get a fair chance to pursue what they want, as long as they don't intend to hurt other people.

6. Are you extroverted or introverted? If you're ambiverted, when do you lean on each side? What excites you? What drains your energy? How do you feel alive when plagued by boredom and the mundane?

I get energy from being around other creative and ambitious people. I'm extroverted, but I don't need to be around people all the time. I like chaos on my own terms and outside of my apartment. I get drained by being in low-stakes environments, when I can't see the point of what I'm doing and it feels like it's not transforming or advancing me in any way, by being around small-minded people who want to put you in the same box they put themselves, or people who want you to take it easy and have fun instead of supporting your goals. I also get really drained by pets and children.

7. What people/values/things do you hold dear to yourself? How do you prevent yourself from being separated from them? Does being disconnected scare you? Do you desire to fit in with the world?

Films and books I discover that fit what I'm experiencing perfectly and indirectly give me the answers I was searching for, things people say in passing that do the same thing - it doesn't matter if I like the person or not. I value when relationships feel 50/50, people who are encouraging, show effort and come up with things to do just as much as I do, who respond right away, show up on time, and generally make me feel like they respect my time and show interest in what I do. Being disconnected in a way that no one knows about me and I'm completely untethered does scare me. I'm not afraid of doing things on my own, or moving away from everyone I love and being completely alone in a new place, however, because I always initiate things, and wherever I go, I'm never alone there for long. I desire to fit in without losing my individuality.

8. What are the biggest disappointments you have? It doesn't even have to be something that happened to you personally. What is something you expected more from, but it somehow managed to fall short?

Those rare cases where I didn't do what I wanted to do, because I misjudged a situation or let someone else influence my decision. I often expect more from situations and end up being disappointed because they're too mundane. It's something about that mismatch that feels so hollow, either something visual, the place playing the wrong kind of music, people looking the part but saying the wrong things. I also expected something completely different from romantic relationships, but in this case, it feels like everyone is following the script too closely and has the same ideas about how things should go, and I just can't get on board with that.

9. What do you expect from others? Are you entitled to anything? Be it love or materialistic things. How easy is it to rely on others? To depend on something else outside of your control?

I've talked about the first half already. Relying on others comes easy if I observe them doing something in a way I find trustworthy. I can depend on other people to do their part, but I prefer to have split responsibilities. I don't feel the need to have complete control over everything, but I also enjoy leading, for example if I need to manage a project at work.

10. What are you as a person? How do you see yourself? How do others see you? How do you want others to see you? How do you want to see yourself?

People usually have a pretty correct impression of me. I'm practical, creative, efficient, resourceful, good in a crisis, motivated, friendly, witty, direct. The only thing that surprises me is that people often find me polarizing, but that's the price of being opinionated and having specific interests.

11. How do you organize your thoughts? What are concepts and ideas to you? How do you navigate through such a hazy frightening future? What do you believe are the most important questions one can ask?

I write most things down and make lists because it's too much hassle trying to remember everything. Concepts and ideas are great if they have practical application. That stuff about the future sounds very dramatic. I am focused on what I can do now and if what I'm doing is getting me closer to my goal, but I don't have everything planned out to the smallest detail because things are always changing and it would make no sense to follow a rigid plan. The most important question you can ask is if you're doing the most important thing for you at any given moment.

12. Are your instincts something to be trusted? Your first-impressions, or your natural intuition on things. How often, and when, are you on ""autopilot"" with your body? Doing things out of habit and muscle memory.

I'm very observant and I pick up on a lot of little clues, so I do trust my instincts. It also helps that I am usually aware of how I came to those conclusions. I'm very rarely on autopilot, and I don't really do anything out of habit or engage in any personal rituals. I am fine with coffee, without it, I'm not tired or annoyed if I have to wake up at 4am, but I can also get up at 9. None of this has any gravity for me.",1,1765480760.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,1.0,False

Phase 1: The Innocent Opening (Building Trust)
Contact: Veda and Kunal live next door.

Helpful Neighbor: Kunal offers genuine-sounding advice and resources to Veda regarding her intense exam stress, positioning himself as an intellectual equal and resource.

Shared Space: They establish a routine of meeting on the building's terrace after sunset, away from her parents' supervision.

Phase 2: Subtle Shifts (Emotional Manipulation)
The Confidant: Kunal gently critiques Veda's parents' control, framing it as concern for her brilliance and potential: ""You're too brilliant to be caged like this, Veda.""

The ""Adult"" Experience: He introduces her to disapproved activities—late-night coffee, culturally challenging films, or wine on the terrace—making her feel mature and rebellious under his guidance.

The Debt of Gratitude: Kunal steps in decisively during a minor crisis (e.g., missed transport for an exam, urgent requirement), making Veda feel intensely reliant on him as her guardian angel.

Phase 3: The Boundary Crossing (The Slow Corruption)
The Test of Loyalty: Kunal begins asking Veda to keep minor secrets from her family, forcing her to choose his trust over her family's rules.

The Intimacy of Proximity: Their interactions move from the terrace to his flat for ""study sessions"" emphasizing the private nature of their time together.

The Emotional Hook: He shares a staged vulnerability about his past. Veda, feeling special and responsible for his emotional well-being, comforts him, blurring the lines of their relationship and solidifying his emotional control.",1,1765480755.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

They also agreed that dark roasted coffees age (lose CO2) faster than light roasts. This has implications for how long it is best to wait after roasting before brewing. My experience is mostly with a dark (maybe Full City +) roast. I have read it is best between 4 and (mine does lose quality after) 12 or so days. I have been storing it in 2 oz jars at about 55F.

This is great information for me, as now I can roast the larger 1/2 lb batches recommended by many. Also, I can have an assortment of roasted coffees in the freezer and move from one to another without sacrificing freshness and quality. ",1,1765480469.0,FreshroastSR800,0,1.0,False

Before I start, I just wanted to say thank you for all your comments and messages, they really opened my eyes and gave me a fresh perspective on the entire situation. If you remember my previous post (it got removed), I mentioned that I was thinking about leaving my husband. Well, after doing a lot of said thinking and talking to my close friends, therapist, and several DV advocates, I can safely say I’m no longer thinking about leaving him.

I *am* leaving him.

For years, I thought my husband just wanted what was best for me. I thought him telling me  how I should run, train, or “improve” myself was because he wanted me to be happy. But even after I told him multiple times how this bothered me, he still didn’t stop. He even does it during intimacy, telling me what he “likes” on me repeatedly, like he’s grading me or telling me what I ought to be doing instead of just enjoying the moment. Nothing is ever enough.

And that wasn’t all. He would also go through these ridiculous mood swings where any little thing could set him off, whether that be the spilled coffee grounds I mentioned previously or, most recently, me not giving him the answer he expected. That last one caused him to give me the silent treatment for *three days straight,* during which he slept on the couch completely of his own volition (Ironically, those were probably the most peaceful three days of my life). It’s not the first time he’s done that either.

I’m realizing that financially, it’s been messed up too. He makes more than me, yet he’s often low on money and I’ve been covering a *lot.* This was common in the early days of our relationship when he couldn’t work, but what’s his excuse now? Even when I got unexpectedly laid off, he let me work *three* part-time jobs instead of offering to help me the way I helped him. He’s always talking about financial responsibility, yet leaves so much of it to me.

Also, I didn’t mention this in my previous post, but his brother has been staying with us for the past year and a half to attend grad school nearby. That itself didn’t bother me, but the brother’s attitude does. Because of his status (he’s also an immigrant student), I never expected him to pay rent, but I *did* expect him to help or contribute to the household in a positive manner, something which he just can’t seem to do. Instead, he barely talks to me or my husband, doesn’t say please or thank you, and when he’s not at school or his on-campus job, spends all his time in his room (which used to be the office). 

There was one recent incident where I made dinner for everyone (something my husband and I take turns doing) and, instead of staying to eat with us, the brother took his plate to his room without so much as a thank you directed at me. I didn’t tell my husband at the time, but I was *furious.* We’ve spoken about his brother’s behavior before (especially during couples’ therapy), but despite my repeated asking, my husband has never addressed it.

Anyway, when I thought about all these incidents together, along with previous ones that occurred throughout our relationship, I realized I didn’t want to live like this anymore. I can’t spend the rest of my life walking on eggshells and tiptoeing around his moods just to keep the peace. Although we’d talked about having a family someday, that’s not something I want anymore. The man throws a fit over a bad night’s sleep or a messy countertop—how would he ever cope with a newborn?

I’ve secured a new place near my work and the keys are hidden in my purse as I write this. I’ve been discreetly packing under the guise of “donations” while transporting boxes to a small storage unit, and I plan to leave in just a few days. My friend is having a holiday party this weekend, and since I usually stay the night, I’ll be using that as a cover to take my essentials. I’ll return the next day while he’s out to pick up our cat under the guise of taking her to an appointment (the only reason I’m not taking her the same day is because she gets very anxious while traveling, and I want to streamline the process as much as possible).

I drafted an email that I’ll send once I’m safely out, framing it as a temporary “separation” instead of a permanent split to hopefully try and mitigate some of the damage (and besides, in my state, you have to be separated for a while anyways before you can file for divorce). I also plan to email my current landlord once I’m out to explain the circumstances and try to get my name off the lease. Considering the brother is still living there, I’m sure having him replace me won’t be an issue (for the landlord at least—ha!) 

Am I nervous? Yes, incredibly. I’m terrified of my (soon-to-be-ex) husband’s reaction or of something going wrong. But I’m also excited. I’m looking forward to being in a new place with just me and my cat and existing without someone telling me I’m doing it all wrong. Part of me keeps worrying I’m overreacting or making a huge mistake, but one of the messages I was sent here has helped me see things clearly—if my best friend came to me with this exact story, what would I tell her? Would I say she should stay and keep trying, or would I tell her to run?

Long story short, I would tell her to run.

I’ll update again once I’m out and settled, but for now, I just wanted to let you guys know what was going on and thank you again for all the support you’ve shown me. For too long, I’ve accepted this treatment because I thought it was normal, but it’s not. And I won’t be taking it anymore.

I'm 22 years old and I recently confessed to my guy best friend that I liked him. I sent a text to him saying that I know telling him on a text wasn't ideal, but because it was my first time ever confessing to someone, I felt more comfortable doing it that way. He replied and said the he felt flattered by what I was saying, but the he would like to talk in person.

We ended up meeting a day later at a coffee shop. He asked me a lot of questions as to what I was expecting on a partner in a relationship, what I liked about him, etc. Those types of questions and then told me he felt flattered and was grateful for the fact I told him, but he didn't want to tell me he felt the same way just to make me feel better. He said he likes someone else and that when he sees me, he likes me, but doesn't see me romantically. I know the girl he likes, she and I used to be friends but that girl refused him a while ago. The reason I told him even though I knew, was because he kept sending mixed signals. There's literally things he doesn't do with other girls, just with me. So I asked him because I wanted peace and clarity for myself.


However, although I'm clear with his answer because he said no. When we left (I drove him to his house) he gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. I've never had a boyfriend nor being in a relationship and I'm no expert, but is that normal? Like, I can't find a reason as to why he may have done that. It was sweet, but it made me wonder a lot.

I'm not upset with his response at all. He was nice and gentle, but my heart does feel something and I don't know what. Like I said, it was the first time I ever genuinely liked someone and felt this way for someone. I know I have to move on because he said no, but I still have that thing and other things that just don't click. Thoughts anyone?",1,1765480176.0,relationship_advice,11,0.67,False

1pk61xd,https://i.redd.it/ve718xcyim6g1.jpeg,[B&A] Winter flare-ups and what calmed my skin this time,"I live in Montana and every winter my skin gets wrecked. I love skiing and being outside, but the cold wind and dry air always set off my mild eczema. My cheeks and jawline get red, tight, and irritated every time the temperature drops.

I also have sensitive skin and break out easily, so try to mostly stick with natural products. Moisturizers or anything with a lot of additives usually makes things worse for me, or cause breakouts like crazy.

I used to live in SC near the beach, and the stable weather there helped clear up most of my symptoms. Montana winters are a different experience. As soon as it gets really cold my face starts to flare, and I feel self conscious at work and in public.

Here is a before and after from November to December. The second photo is about a month later.

I have tried a lot of moisturizers and redness products over the years. The green tinted products that are supposed to calm redness always made my skin look strange, and many regular moisturizers clog my pores. I also do not use steroids, so I have been looking for something that can help without irritating my skin even more.

This winter I tried Icelandic lamb tallow balm as a barrier moisturizer. I did not expect much, and was worried about pore clogging but have been happy so far. It feels like the tallow balm melts into my skin, does not sting, and actually protects my face on ski days.

Favorite so far: 
Vanilla Latte- smells like a coffee shop and feels great
Unscented- no smell, and no additives if my skin is having a bad flare up (I used this for the first 2 weeks)

My daily routine:
Morning: 
- Wash face with warm water
- Gentle cleanse if needed 
- Apply tallow to clean dry skin and leave it alone

Evening:
Same thing

Staying consistent was great. After a few days my skin felt less raw, and after a few weeks my skin looked calmer, and helped control both the redness and the irritation that comes with the cold.

Work, family, obligations, screens, noise (oh the noise). Eventually it feels like your brain never really shuts off, it just goes offline for a few hours when you sleep. I didn’t want massive routine changes or some perfect wellness lifestyle. I just wanted a way to reset in the middle of my days.

 

I started experimenting with what I now think of as “micro-resets.” Tiny 1–2 minute breaks that help ratchet stress down without needing a meditation mat or a free hour. Here are a few that have actually stuck:

 

• A simple 4-breath pause while waiting in the car or for coffee  
• Naming 5 things you see + 3 things you feel to pull your brain out of overdrive  
• A 90-second shake-out (shoulders, hands, neck, toes) to release tension  
• One kind sentence to yourself instead of the usual internal trash-talk  
• A quick boundary check: “What’s one thing I can say no to this week?”

 

None of these are life-changing on their own, but stacked together they make a real difference over time. I’m calmer under pressure and let go of things more easily.

 

Does anyone here use small resets during the day? If so, I’d love to hear what works for you.

I have recently broken up with a woman I was very much in love with. The whole relationship lasted just 2 months, but it was incredibly intense and gave me some of the best feelings of my life. I felt so alive and motivated, fuelled by immense love to do anything and everything for this woman as well as to be the best version of myself. I not just imagined the rest of my life with her, but was actively turning it into reality.



I'll try to give a factual rundown of how things went and provide as a side some of my feelings that arose in certain situations.



Our first meet



We met on an online dating app, and she lived in a different country. She was also married and in the process of getting a divorce, still living with her husband (I understand very much what huge oversight this was). We got on a video call and talked for about an hour. I didn't feel like she was very interested in me but I liked her. We kept texting over the next days and I decided that I'll ask her out properly, fly to her city and spend the weekend there. She agreed and I planned a full day on Saturday. We met in the morning, I picked her up near her place with the rented car and flowers, went for a drive and got to a coffee place. Conversation was great, we talked about psychology, everything was flowing and nice. We then went on to a spa, you'll probably think it's a weird first date idea, but honestly it was amazing overall, but when we got to the sauna we also got naked next to each other after a couple hours of meeting. That was a bit nerve racking but after that everything was great. We were relaxing, talking, getting to know each other, talking about how great it is to meet. We liked each other and I kissed her later on. It felt like we are already close to each other. After the spa I took her to a nice restaurant I booked for us. Dinner was great, we had fun, went back to the car, drove back, kiss goodnight, goodbye. I am leaving the next day. The next morning we text a bit and I ask if she'd like to get some coffee, and we meet for coffee. We have a nice time but it feels a bit concerning. In the end I tell her I like her, but I am not sure how much she likes me. She says that with her current situation with the marriage not working out she's at a low point but she has gone through the process of grief and everything, accepted it and is moving forward. I tell her that her husband will probably come back to her again at some point as their story is a back and forth, but she gives an assuring ""not in this lifetime"" response. She says she has to take it slow and be careful in a new relationship though. I understand. I go back and on the way back I am both happy and concerned.



Between there and 2nd meet, we are texting and calling more and more. We are talking about ourselves, she starts saying things how she never met anyone like me, and how her feelings developing for me are very new to her. Anyway we are getting closer and closer and the amazing feelings of love are starting to develop. I am motivated to play music and get in touch with my creative side, more motivated to work, to start a business etc. I start thinking about her night and day.



Our second meet



I decide it's time to spend time with her again, this time for longer. I plan to stay 10 days in her city, renting an apartment. We meet on Friday I arrive, she's working late and I meet her at her office and we go out for drinks. It goes terribly, I am shook by seeing her I guess, I feel very uninteresting, don't know what to talk about, it's very very awkward. I have no confidence to even touch her. We talk about travelling and she travelled a lot. All over the world. This makes me more uncomfortable, she is saying things like how she went out and met people etc. Including my country where she said she met some 2 guys that were very tall and big and how they made her feel tiny next to them and shows me the photo. I don't know what to say, I guess I'm pretending to be unphased by it. Anyway, the awkwardness continues throughout the night with some tiny glimpses of something. She says things like ""what's going on? where did your game go?"". At some point, we call it a night, head to my car and have a long passionate kiss in the car. I take her home and drive myself home. I feel terrible when I get back, have nightmares that night, something about seeing her not liking me and seeing her with someone else.



I wake up the next morning and the plan is to take her to a candlelight concert tonight, with dinner before. We talk during the day and things lighten up compared to last night. I'm going to speed up a bit. I pick her up, we have dinner, things are okayish. We go to the concert. It's great, I feel like we are getting back on track, I whisper sweet things to her, she responds well etc. After the concert, I take her to a cocktail bar. We get a drink, sit down, talk on a deeper level, it's good, I tell her my intentions which at that point are serious relationship with her, and that I want my future with her. Received well. We go to my place, have sex, after sex we are lying next to each other. In my opinion sex was great, but it seems something is wrong. I ask and she says she's used to a different shape and size of the penis. Weirdly it doesn't bother me immediately, I think because I was so confident that sex was great. But it feels like she is almost crying, she reveals how everything was perfect with me so far and that she set her expectations too high for this part as well and somehow set her self up for disappointment.



The next day, that thing starts bothering me, we go out for coffee after I made breakfast for us at home. I tell her it bothers me what she said and that it's a problem. She says that based on sex alone she would not continue this relationship but because she already has feeling for me she will. I think it's a very weird thing to hear for something that's supposed to make me feel better. We walk, talk, go to lunch, and eventually I start feeling better. I say ""we'll figure this sex thing out"". We get home, have sex again, she finishes on top and says ""hey we figured the sex thing out"". Great, everything is lovely. All the rest of the week we are together while working in coworking offices. Most of the nights she stays with me.



On one evening, we stay home and talk more. She wants me to ask her questions because she doesn't feel like I am getting to know her or that I don't want to get to know her and that I am not telling her things like whether I noticed some ""icks"" about her. She says I surely must have and that I don't want to share them. I feel weird, like I'm being put in a weird position - I don't feel like saying anything that I noticed about her that I don't like because there is nothing and I start questioning myself whether I am not observant enough and what I am supposed to act like, think like and what questions I need to ask. She says that as soon as something bothers me, I must say it and hold nothing in. Anyway, I come up with a list of question from simple and easy, funny to deeper stuff. We talk and have a good connection, eventually she is sitting on me face to face and I tell her I love her. She smiles very warmly and hugs me and starts crying after a while. We hold on to that moment for a long time. She reveals that it was like a burden off her heart, while at the same time she felt some anger because ""where was I all this time, why did she have to go through all the shit she did before meeting me"". She says she never felt what she feels for me. From here on our, there's a lot of soulmate connection kind of stuff in our communication.



On one day, when driving home from dinner, she asks if I would be less attracted to her if she got fat. I don't know what to say, so I try to answer honestly and say that if she gained a lot of weight I would probably feel less attracted to her but that it would really have to be a lot of weight. It is not taken well, she shuts down, is upset, and I am trying to say stuff to make it better but it seems there's nothing I can do. We get home, she doesn't want to get close, hug or kiss, but she smiles seemingly condescendingly to my face as she pulls away. We get to bed and I try talking to her more but she does not reply. I say something like I know you're tired of me tonight so I'll just say I love you and my attraction to you is not mandated by your physical appearance. I turn away but I notice her twitching for a while and I turn back, comforting her with touches. She starts crying and reveals how she took it as my love for her is conditional and that she doesn't care about the physical because she is looking for someone for her whole life and it's great if I have a great body but it's not the important thing. Okay, next day we wake up and everything seems reset to normal and great. We have sex, breakfast, go to work, etc.



On one of our dates, I mention I have a friend in one city and that I'd like to visit him. She said she loves that city, that she had her best date in that city. Crushing. I can't understand why she'd say that. She sees it bothers me and says how she's just used to telling that story that way, as in in her mind it's just labelled best date but of course the ones with me are better. I accept it but it continues to bother me.



The last night before my departure I took her to a theatre to see ballet. It's nice, we enjoy it and talk. Afterwards, we need to get to the car and I am a bit distracted between talking to her and figuring out the way to the garage etc. We get to the garage and I notice she is upset. We were going to the car for her to change heels to shoes and go to dinner, we were talking about whether to take the car somewhere or just find something here. When we get to the car I ask so what are we doing, should we take the car or not. She snaps at me as in we said we'll just stay here, where are we gonna park if we go, she responds rudely. I tell her hey I just asked a question, no need to talk to me like that. In that moment, I feel like, you know, I am organising all these things for us and this seems unfair from her side. Anyway, when I instantly told her that it bothered me as she told me to do, it made things worse. She says, of course you only care about your feelings and ego instead of focusing on my feelings first since I am upset first, you should take care of that firstly. It's awkward from there, she storms out, opens doors on her own and we somehow get to a restaurant for dinner. She tells me how I don't have the emotional capacity to lead conflict resolution. And that I don't know what to say and I shut down when things get hard. Well, she's right. I really do not know what to say in these situations, but I'm not sure the situation is fair. When I try to say or do something, it seems to be shut down or met with no response. So I have no response either, and it seems that no matter what I try to say or do, it will all go the same way - not right. Not what she wants me to say, i.e. I don't understand her fully, and I should know better what she's feeling and thinking. If I ask directly, she doesn't want to tell me because she's tired of explaining and wants me to pick up on things. Anyway, it feels very similar to the night of the fat question, we get home, bed, but no sex in the morning. We have to get up early though because she has a flight in the morning as well. I take her to the airport, kiss, I love you I love you. My flight back is later that day. I go back with conflicting thoughts and feelings. My journal talks about how many different and strong emotions I felt in these 10 days, like a roller-coaster. I call my mom for a bit at the airport and tell her that it was nice but that there are times when she is upset and I don't know what to say to make it better.



Our third meet



We plan a trip together now, I fly to her country and we rent an airbnb out in a nearby city to live there for a month. It is extremely turbulent throughout. I would summarise it as very tiring, 24/7 doubting myself whether I said or did something wrong. I will give some examples but it's hard to put everything to words, there was so much that happened I have to skip a lot. In my call with my therapist who at this point knows all of the above, I ask him how do I look? He says terrible, like I've been to war for a week. One of the more disturbing things for me was early in the trip at dinner, we talked about previous drug use, she mentioned she did cocaine a couple of times. I ask when was the last time and she says actually this March, she went out, met some guys in a bar, did cocaine with one of them in the bathroom. I tell her that this is a very disturbing image to hear, especially because at that time her marriage was basically just at the start and her reasoning for going out that night is because things were not working out and she was dealing with a lot. I think okay but it's quite obvious that this is not the right thing to do, I try to tell her her that. I try to get her to say that she was wrong for doing that. Does not go well, she says I don't understand what she went through and that she doesn't have any regrets about it. So I ask more about what she went through in her marriage and it comes down to the guy being an avoidant personality, not working on himself, not cuddling her at night, not trying to fix their problems. Weird, but okay, I try to accept it, but it does come up a couple of days later when we get to talking about her marriage again and I try to get more of the husband's perspective, so for example, she never told him she did that cocaine night. She eventually explodes as she feels that I am not on her side and why should I even care about what the guy said or thought I should only care about her and she thinks I don't believe her. She says she's not the right person for me if I expect her to say that she was wrong about doing cocaine in a bar bathroom with some guy while having marriage problems.



Another example is when on the final day before going back, she asks me about my casual dating history which we mentioned before, I said I only did it in one instance on a trip. She asks more about that and I tell her there were 2 girls I saw in that period with just casual intentions, she makes a huge deal about how I said one instance but there were two girls. I meant as in one instance of the period of the trip, she took at as it was just one girl but since there were two, I am a liar among other things. She asks if I liked it, and I say that it was nice, I provide the context of recently going through a breakup before that and that it felt nice to be wanted by a woman. It does not go well, she says how can I like the experience of it, when I said I don't like casual dating and that I think it's not good for a person. I am a hypocrite. So I turn it around on her a bit, I ask did she like her experiences which are very extensive. She says she cannot even remember because she doesn't allow those thoughts in her mind because what she feels for me is on a totally different level and she thought I was on her level but I am actually much below her level. Okay, I keep pushing and she admits to having enjoyed sex with her previous partners as in ""yeah, sure, it was good"". Okay, I ask more about how many people she was with that way, she says 40-50. Whatever, I never wanted to find this out anyway, but I already accepted her past. I knew she did casual dating much more than I did, I didn't want to concern myself with numbers but ended up there somehow anyway. Things are not good between us but we sit down for a beer and somehow reconnect very strongly. We go home and have probably the best sex we had. After that, we are in the bathroom, she is in the shower and I hesitate to join her in there, I'm not sure why. Kind of just mesmerised by the recent sex and don't know if to impose or not, so I don't. She gets out of the shower and I immediately see something is wrong - ""why didn't you join me?"". We are not on the same level thing again. I cannot understand how we can feel so close one minute, and so far away the next because I didn't join her in the shower. I wish she would have just voiced an invite, I would not hesitate at all. But okay, that's how it is, it gets worse and worse, I try to say the right things but nothing works, she goes to sleep on the couch. I come to her to convince her to come back to bed once, nope. I go back a bit later, I try again, and I carry her to bed. Next day I take her to her house and go back.



4th meet



That same day I dropped her off she messages me, and it feels eerie. She wants to talk to me tomorrow. Okay, tomorrow we don't get on a call because I'm busy and it's too late. But we talk the next day, she says how when she got home her husband packed her things and told her to leave. Eventually he switched up and things got emotional and they were crying together. He kissed her, and she pushed him back but with a delay. Not nice to hear, I don't know what to think but okay, I go to bed.



Next morning, she says she hasn't told me everything and she wants to come clean. She writes a very long message about how what happened confirmed her feelings for me and how she is totally over her husband now and everything is confirmed for her. The whole message sounds like a victory element for her. She says that what happened was very brief but did get physical at some point. So I have to play detective - what is physical? - It means it got sexual. What does sexual mean? It means he was inside of me. Great... She says it was just 5 seconds and that she avoided the word sex because it was not sex for her. It was her trauma response to freeze and her mind was thinking of me all the time but her body gave up (the trauma response is from her marriage which is less than a year and apparently the guy is an avoidant personality, she does not have any physical abuse traumas. The trauma is from him leaving her to cry alone and not being there for her emotionally). She says in those 5 seconds the guy already came, she went to take a shower and cried. I tell her I'll take some time and get back to her but that I feel manipulated with the way she revealed this and that I had to keep digging for the truth.



Next day, I get on a call with her and tell her that I don't see a way forward. That it's over. She cries and wants to do everything to fix it. She says she will fly to my city the next evening and wants me to see her. I tell her that it's futile, I will not get over this especially because I did not see it coming at all since from the start her position was that she is totally over with the marriage, just the divorce needs to be finalised.



Anyway, she does come to my city and I meet her. She can't stop smiling when seeing my face and it takes a while to even start talking. We go to my place and talk, I appreciate that she's here but what now? How to fix this? I don't see a way and she says that she doesn't either but that her coming here, love and all that, with time we can work through it. I ask questions, clarification of details. I ask how it could have happened without her consent, where were her underwear, doesn't she have to be wet etc. Quite uncomfortable for both of us. She reveals that the act was actually he started rubbing against her in bed, and they eventually rolled over so she was on top of him during the sex. I think in my mind, that's so much worse - I try to imagine how can you grab a woman and put her on top of yourself so easily without her participation, let alone slide it in (+ with her underwear on her) as she is saying she was like a corpse during this in her freeze response. Would be very interested in hearing women giving their perspective on this... Finally, she cannot handle these questions and storms out.



The next morning, she sends me recorded calls with her husband. After she told him about me, he encouraged her to go see me and try to fix it. And in the call, she told him how I asked these questions and how she thought I'd understand her trauma and feelings around what happened but I was actually concerned about the details of the act. The guy says that asking these questions I asked is not normal, that I am insecure and immature, that my hurt is understandable but my dealing with it is crazy. That if I am as perfect as she claimed so much, that I would understand and appreciate her coming to me. I feel so weird, like it's both of them against me now. Okay whatever, I go see her at her airbnb, we talk, we cry, we have sex, I bring her back home. When I do, I'm so torn apart. I love this woman, but I am haunted by these thoughts. She cheated on me, yet I should not think of it that way at least according to her. This goes on, I bring something up, she storms out, she comes back, roller-coaster all over the place. I don't know who's crazier at this point, me, her or her husband. Anyway, this up and down goes on for a couple of days. I'm trying very hard and there's a lot of crying and good and bad emotions but overall it's very very bleak most of the time, even when I feel a bit closer to her again. On one day, after my therapy appointment, she says she cannot deal with my indecisiveness, but I cannot give her the confidence she needs. She says she has done and said everything she could, and since that doesn't seem enough for me to decisively say we're gonna work things out, she storms out one last time.",0,1765480046.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,1,0.5,False

James was finally getting to settle into his office, weak incense filling the air with a swirling smoke as he shuffled through papers on a well beaten desk.

It came with the desk and a set of chairs. They were all in a bad shape so he bought a plane and chisel to peel off their surface finish with. Now he's in the market some pine wax or linseed oil to coat them with. In the meantime his office smelled like a wood working shop.

Definitely not a bad thing in his mind. Just not the atmosphere he wanted.

He needed to sweep though.

The rest of his office had camping gear, filing cabinets, some modern art that wasn't his to move out. Well, it also wasn't theirs to say he couldn't use as a coat hanger and hat stand either.

There was a matching trashcan and umbrella holder. Different set to the desk.

With the contents of several folders on the two cases and each of the recent big events laid out on the desk he leaned back. He could do notes later, for now he was to wait until command's other agent arrived.

Dropping a chunk of condensation from the freezer (of his minifridge, Key office infrastructure, absolutely non negotiable) into his coffee mug and poured in equal parts cola and whisky. He pushed his swivel chair back with a kick that turned him around and he smiled at the view over the beltway.

Old James Marlow had spent his childhood living in a place like this, brick, rust, rockwool. Old wood, snow and cheap solutions to persistent problems everywhere.

He remembered his dad, the man spending most of the money he earned on long storage food or alcohol. His mother working on favors for neighbors, patching clothes and fixing appliances for things like spices, butter and colas.

The two sure loved each other but they were strained to care for the amount of kids they had. Struggling to keep those kids out of the cabinets, off the streets.

He drowned his chuckle with a sip of his drink, one of his favorites from back in the day.

They were rapscallions all of them, but they loved their family and their street. Some of them were still there under a tree, smiles on their faces, every last one.

He held up a toast to the window with a smile.

Today the streets were relatively clean, the gangs yell instead of shooting, food is cheap, and corporations keep to themselves.

Things were different 100 years ago.

Those riots when he was a kid brought the attention of Fleet Command onto the cities of the ships. Onto their management.

The Rubicon sent out its agents and enforcers to find out why people were upset and put things to right. He'd been found doing their job in his own special way.

Of course, they brought him in. Locked him into working with them. He bristled and chaffed against the restraint of command and their orders  but that was expected, encouraged even. 

He was wild and alone in those days, out for himself and his family. Restraint had to be forced so he didn't burn himself up. Trainers and mentors put him to rest a million different ways so he would heal correctly, grow strong and work better.

Eventually he finished his contract, went through a frankly superfluous round of bootcamp and roamed the fleet (mostly) on his own will.

While this job here was issued, he would have volunteered.

Interventions are sensitive situations and should be handled with utm-

""HEY DOGGIE!"" The shrill near scream of a kid almost drowned out the slamming and rattling of the old office door.

""Who's a good boy, huh, all cozy in your detective office with your scotch and bourbon? Looking after that special lady C was telling me about, tracking down that noisy bird we all just *know* crashed on this ship? No? What happened to them?""

Serina teased and chided as he turned his chair around with the most unamused look possible. She was practically all over his office, asking about, poking around and making messes of an otherwise comprehensible space.

""Isn't your mother available?"" he interrupted

She turned away from examining the art piece, ""Mr.Monrow,""

""Not my name.""

She lept up onto his desk and bend down towards him, ""I assure you I am the most prepared and ready for this job that anyone has ever been! Besides, C says I need experience.""

""You're a kid, you shouldn't be on a serious job like this"" James said back as he stowed his whisky and glared up at her.

She scoffed and hopped down to the side, ""You were younger when you started.""

""I wasn't acting like a brat, nore was I hyperactive. You are both and it raises concerns."" He capped the soda bottle and sipped deeply from his mug.

Little Serina walked back over to the door and kicked it closed, ""There is no reason *I* can't do perfectly fine here, and this job isn't all that high stakes anyway.""

""Have you ever killed anyone?"" He asked pointedly.

She seemed to hem and haw for a bit, ""not on purpose""

""You mi-wait, what do you mean 'not on purpose'? Serina, what did you do?"" She squirmed under his glare, he may have sprouted some extra hair as he stood up slowly.

She was at least brave to look him in the eye as she explained herself.

\---

So, one more time.

All the things that can go wrong on a car or helicopter can go wrong 4 or 5 different times on any of these, and I only have the tools I can carry on my own back. 

60 lb (roughly 28 kg) of bread and donut glaze lasts me about 1 day and I am not actually living among mole people.

Magic is here, and it's precious. Everything is built to either not use it at all or only use what one person can put out. Simple spells are a ONCE a day thing.

I am in a ballon bubble built to imitate planetary conditions inside an interstellar cruise ship that's currently working on figuring out 70s and 80s electronics. 

There are several of these ships, with new, much smaller ones being minted or expanded.

Mega corporations are hoarding intellectual property industry expertise to try and monopolize markets to secure and expand their holdings on these ships.

Some things are a lot better than where I come from, like with guns and mechs. Other things are a lot worse, like environmental protections and violent gangs.

Ethics are imaginary except for individual people who walk on eggshells around each other and their employers and...well surely there's someone who has to be honest at an organizational level.

Surely. 

Any way, back to me. None of my machines move and I am contemplating kidnapping someone to help me with that.

Each machine uses the same arrangement of pistons as pushers and rubber bladders as pullers for every axis of every joint. Best I can tell the bladders provide main motivation and the pistons gauge position or dampen movement.

Fluid lines come down from the main body to both.

Pistons and bearings are fed oil by the heavy pump things I took to sell, safe to say it's a big electric motor and hydraulic pump with lots of valves. 

The wire wrapped bladders have some very thick lines leading back into the same cluster of stuff working the thrusters. The cluster of valves and cylinders that pipe to rocket nozzles on the back of the knees have a second set of pipes leading up to the muscles. 

Anchor points at the ends of the muscles around the mid thigh seem to inject pressure. Which expands them wider and shorter providing a ton of force without much power. Some of those muscles lead down to the knee (mostly the big ones) and the rest go back up to the hip joint.

Only 2 things that get the inch and change gauge copper wires, the hydraulic hub and the rocket nozzles directly. 

Those big wires do get tapped off for smaller power things but it's hard to keep track of all those little boxes and what they're for. Just too many insulated wires and pipes the same size running back and forth on the same stretch or frame, all running back and forth between little relay and switch boxes.

Fiberoptic and high voltage lines run along the frame opposite the accessories. (Two C channel bars making up the bones of the arms and legs before merging between the elbow/knee and wrist/ankle)

All of that stuff, through all 6 of my mechs (save for parts of Fuck-you and Parts-cannon) looks fine.

All the capacitors that feed those hi-v lines are fine on at least Red-1, Red-2 and Bunny-ears. All the rest either have stuff messed up or need deep cleaned.

I am not fucking around with cleaning them. I am tired and hungry and have a list of tools to buy and have some parts to sell.

Leaving my freshly filthied up electrician gloves next to all my wrenches I take a few moments to stretch and twist before hiking down the pile. Climbing up on my rope ladder with some generic looking circuit boards packed into my pockets and a notion to visit a place that does repairs to barter for their tools.

Mostly so I don't have to carry heavy shit up with me again.

Now should I use the same door as last time? There's a spook interested in me, they know foodtruck street is where I was lingering yesterday. 

I'm hoping they don't know the bakery. I'm hoping I can find the bakery, and that its not night already. It might be raining with how washy the canals are sounding, none of it is overflowing into the cavern yet though.

Taking what looks like a greasy tarp, lamenting my lack of cutting implement, I fold it and stack all the circuit boards on top. Pulling the tarp up around them. Then wrapping a similarly folded cargo net around that, and turning the bundle upside down, I have my little sale bundle. 

If the tarp isn't waterproof I should at least have some time with how much I folded it. And how much grease is packed into it.

Not perfect, but I can't do more without knowing more. A lot like my mechs.

Grabbing my chainsaw bike and walking it up to the top of the ramp, I descide to leave it for a quick shower. Parking it (and my computer crap) at the door. 

I come back clean and only slightly damp, though I catch a thought and pull my bundle of sale cargo over my shoulder to rest diagonal across my back.

Pushing my bike into a bump start I begin exploring the tunnels wi-...crap. I don't have anything to make a map with. Well, now we're on 12 things for the shopping list, at least.

I can only groan and try to keep track.

Taking a right out of my little H pipe home I just cruise down the bends of the mostly flat canal, noting that there are almost no doors on the line with road access, and it is most definately raining. I'm down the line nearly a mile before I get to an intersecting canal that speaks to me.

Sure enough most doors I jimmy lead into another corporate looking building, through each one notably run down, and one might be a school.

Two doors lead to utility spaces with pumps and valves and stuff, interesting but not today, not without a spool of rope to gui-damnit, 13.

Walking my running bike up a flight of stairs and out into the normal visitor facing area I find I chose a library. It's closed and empty. It's also dark out, and raining.

Fortunately fire codes exist here and I can just push the locked doors open.

There's traffic about, shining headlights and splashing puddles but not very much actual activity. Once I'm down the stairs I sit on the seat of my bike and start own the sidewalk back towards the cluster of buildings I know.

Funnily, the rain isn't actually from clouds. It's from whatever the shelves above are. Some irrigation thing or cleaning stuff that has all those hanging sheets pouring off water. Falling in cascades of ripples or streams that disintegrate into the airflow of the chamber.

It all gets whipped up and turned aro-

I slip and nearly crash while staring up at the ceiling. 

Ending up skidding the bike sideways as it falls over in slow motion and stalls out. Leaving me sitting on my soaked ass and thanking the stars that I thought to sling the chips around onto my back.

I'm sore, not too cold actually but very wet now, and worse, some red legion bitches are leering at me from under an awning.

""Whas amata lil birdie, can' fly in de rain?"" I ignore them and pick myself up slowly, pulling my bike upright as I crouch back down by the motor and turn it with my hand.

""Trubah hear'n girl? Do ya know who's talk'n to ya?"" There's no hard spot in the compression of the engine, everything feels smooth. Standing back up and pulling the rip cord to try and start it doesn't have it roar to life though. I frown at it.

""You know who owns da streets roun 'ere?"" I sigh and turn toward the guy with an unamused look, two of his buddies chuckling under the deployable roof extension.

""Deez ah cahdnah streets"" He makes a grand gesture outward, a car passing behind us as I slide my bike over to a set of newspaper stands to prop it against.

He keeps walking toward me with a laugh, ""Wuz so urgent ya gotta ride in de rain.""

""Delivering."" I give my reply, making him laugh. Again.

""Deliver'n what, girl? Ain' noth'n worth dis rain!""

""Then why are you braving it for me?"" I'm not replying in a friendly tone, he just doesn't seem to care.

He puts a hand on my shoulder and my vision shines.

""'Cus girlz is worth plenty more tan a lil rain."" One hand goes on his chest and the leg on the same side kicks out past his leg and comes back crashing against the back of his knee.

Pushing him down and stepping forward as he looses his footing then slams flat on his back. I turn and stamp my heel into his throat for good measure.

Glaring up at his buddies, seeing they aren't too eager to join him.

""Seems a girl isn't worth the rain after all."" I step back to my bike and give the cord another rip, drowning out his coughs with the roar of a tiny chainsaw motor firing up.

""Seeing as these *are* your streets, could any of you point me toward the nearest repair shop?"" I ask loudly.

Here are 5 instant resets you can do in under 2 minutes,"Life gets loud fast. Work, family, obligations, screens, noise (oh the noise). Eventually it feels like your brain never really shuts off, it just goes offline for a few hours when you sleep. I didn’t want massive routine changes or some perfect wellness lifestyle. I just wanted a way to reset in the middle of my days.



I started experimenting with what I now think of as “micro-resets.” Tiny 1–2 minute breaks that help ratchet stress down without needing a meditation mat or a free hour. Here are a few that have actually stuck: 



• A simple 4-breath pause while waiting in the car or for coffee  
• Naming 5 things you see + 3 things you feel to pull your brain out of overdrive  
• A 90-second shake-out (shoulders, hands, neck, toes) to release tension  
• One kind sentence to yourself instead of the usual internal trash-talk  
• A quick boundary check: “What’s one thing I can say no to this week?”

 

None of these are life-changing on their own, but stacked together they make a real difference over time. I’m calmer under pressure and let go of things more easily.

 

Does anyone here use small resets during the day? If so, I’d love to hear what works for you.

The resort's commitment to gourmet cuisine means you'll never eat at the same restaurant twice during your stay unless you choose to revisit a favorite.

Caribbean cuisine takes center stage at several venues, where talented chefs transform local ingredients and traditional recipes into contemporary masterpieces. Fresh seafood features prominently across multiple restaurants, from succulent lobster and grilled fish to creative seafood preparations that showcase the bounty of the surrounding waters.

The resort's private beach represents one of its most valuable assets—a pristine stretch of white sand exclusively for guest use.

Cabana service elevates the beach experience further, offering shaded retreats with personalized service throughout the day.

The ambiance strikes the perfect balance between vibrant energy and peaceful retreat.

# Why Choose Sandals Dunn's River Over Other Resorts

Within the Sandals portfolio, Dunn's River distinguishes itself through its modern aesthetic and recent renovations that incorporate the latest trends in resort design. While Sandals Montego Bay offers the heritage and classic elegance of the original Sandals property, and Sandals Negril provides the famous seven-mile beach experience, Dunn's River delivers contemporary sophistication combined with Ocho Rios' unique location advantages.

The resort's architecture represents a departure from traditional Caribbean styling, embracing clean lines, modern materials, and innovative design concepts that appeal to couples seeking something fresh and different. The recent transformation has created spaces that feel boutique-hotel stylish while maintaining the comprehensive amenities expected from a full-service resort.

The Ocho Rios location itself offers distinct advantages—it's less developed than Montego Bay, providing a more authentic Jamaican experience, while still offering easy access to attractions and activities. The proximity to Dunn's River Falls provides a unique selling point that other Sandals properties cannot match, allowing guests to experience one of Jamaica's iconic natural wonders during their stay.

For couples who prioritize cutting-edge design, contemporary aesthetics, and the newest resort amenities, Sandals Dunn's River often emerges as the top choice among Sandals properties. Travel professionals at agencies like [Rivage Travel ](https://www.rivagetravel.com/post/sandals-overwater-bungalows)can provide detailed comparisons to help couples select the perfect Sandals resort based on their specific preferences and priorities.

# Booking Tips and Best Time to Visit

Jamaica's tropical climate makes Sandals Dunn's River appealing year-round, but timing your visit strategically can enhance your experience and potentially save money. December through April represents peak season, offering the driest weather and most consistent sunshine but also commanding premium pricing. The summer months and early fall provide excellent value with only marginally increased rainfall—brief afternoon showers that quickly give way to sunshine.

For couples seeking the best combination of weather and value, consider traveling in late April through June or November through early December. These shoulder seasons offer pleasant conditions without peak-season crowds or pricing. Hurricane season officially runs June through November, though serious storms rarely impact Jamaica, and travel insurance provides peace of mind during these months.

When it comes to booking, working with authorized travel agents like [Rivage Travel](https://www.rivagetravel.com/post/sandals-overwater-bungalows) often yields better results than booking directly. Experienced Sandals specialists can access exclusive promotions, room upgrades, and resort credits that aren't available through direct booking channels. Their expertise proves particularly valuable for special occasions like honeymoons or anniversaries, where insider knowledge about room selection, dining reservations, and special amenities can significantly enhance your experience.

Many Sandals promotions include bonuses like free nights, butler service upgrades, or credits toward spa treatments and excursions. These offers change frequently, making it worthwhile to consult with a travel advisor who monitors deals and can alert you to exceptional values. Additionally, Sandals offers a generous booking policy that protects your reservation with minimal risk.

# Guest Reviews and Real Experiences

Sandals Dunn's River consistently earns high marks from guests across major review platforms, with particular praise directed toward staff hospitality, food quality, and the resort's modern aesthetic. Travelers frequently mention the attentive service that makes every guest feel special—from bartenders who remember your favorite drink to housekeeping staff who create towel art and leave thoughtful surprises.

The culinary experience generates enthusiastic reviews, with guests appreciating both the variety of dining options and the quality of execution. Many reviewers note that they never felt like they were eating ""resort food,"" instead enjoying restaurant-quality meals throughout their stay. The rooftop restaurants receive special mention for combining excellent cuisine with spectacular ambiance.

Common highlights include the pristine beach, beautiful pool areas, and the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the property. Honeymooners and anniversary celebrants particularly appreciate the romantic atmosphere and the special touches that make milestone celebrations memorable. Butler service receives consistent praise from guests who upgrade to butler-level suites, with many noting that the personalized attention exceeded their expectations.

Some guests note that the resort's size means slightly longer walks to certain restaurants or amenities compared to smaller properties. Others mention that popular restaurants can require advance reservations during peak periods. However, these minor considerations rarely detract from the overall experience, and most guests emphasize that any small inconveniences pale in comparison to the resort's many strengths.

The only sound was the light bulb's hum. Fabrizio opens the door and steps down the stairs; the creaks echo off the walls with every step until he reaches the bottom. Even though he felt winded;
Once one is at his old age, they'd need to take a moment to breathe, but this night was of too much importance. Fabrizio is approaching his older years, about seventy-seven, and his stature is tall, with an average build; his hair is a coffee brown, which does not age, unlike his body. Once dedicated to being a man of the cloth, he was, but after an altercation with a demon in his early life, he devoted his life to hunting down the demon who stripped him of his faith. After exercising most of Italy, battling werewolves in Romania, and reversing Gypsy curses from France to Poland, he had found the time to end his days fighting the darkness and descend into his own end.
Fabrizio flips a switch to turn on a light above a heavy cell door at the other side of the basement. The door was highly irregular compared to the rest of the area, although it had been so empty, it had stuck out from the surrounding concrete walls and dirt floor. There were no openings, and it resembled the door of an isolation tank in prison. The only opening was accessible only from the outside and was only wide enough to see a pair of eyes. Fabrizio brought a chair that sat in what seemed to be the only dark area of the basement, brought it to the front of the door, and shifted the eye hole open. He walks back to the chair and looks at the door,
""I was nineteen when I started to learn the good book. When I was growing up, my parents fell on hard times and struggled to parent effectively. But I began reading the Bible and sought to find purity and godliness in man. Some odd years later, I had been granted residency in Italy for one of their many cathedrals. One late night, I was attending the church and started picking up after the last mass when a young woman walked in. That night, there had been a terrible storm, so bad that it was only right to dismiss the mass early because the church had almost flooded. But she seemed to be perfectly dry. I bid her a good evening, but she ignored me. She walked into the confessional, and I walked into the booth on the other side."" A low, heavy boding growl had emerged from the darkness inside the cell and rumbled through the door.
""I stared through the divider just watching her and asked if I was able to help her, ""For this is the house of God and all who repent may be absolved of their sin."" The growling had come to a stop, and earthly stomps approached the door, and a voice bellows,
""And what did she say, Favvy?""
Fabrizio had been frozen with fear, but realized he could relax, because he posed more of a threat to the demon behind than the beast to him. ""Well, she had asked for forgiveness and said her last confession had been a month ago. So I asked her what sin she had been asking forgiveness for, to which she said it was the murder of a priest. She lunged through the dividing wall and pushed me through the booth. We fought on the church floor, she bit off my ear and some of my fingers, until I grew angry and struck her in the heart with the cross of my rosary.""
The voice lowered its aggression and spoke to Fabrizio, "" Oh, Favvy, we all make mistakes; you did the right thing. The poor girl couldn't handle my possession anyway."" The demon wholeheartedly laughed, and Fabrizio was quiet. He got up and dug a key from the pocket of his slacks. ""That night is when I devoted my life to tracking you down, and within my dark journey throughout my years was only to damn you back to hell from where you've come from."" The demon shifted to the peephole and peered with his glowing reptile-like eyes. ""And all those gypsies had big mouths, which I will punish after I’m done with you!"" Fabrizio held the key to the door and spoke with assurance, ""Demon, tonight, I will let you free to accompany me for some whiskey, dinner, and cigars. I have decided that it is time for me to lay myself to my final rest. I am too old to live on, you continue possession not just on me but in my home, we settle tonight in peace so you can take me to the after, and you may be free."" The demon raised an eyebrow and questioned Fabrizio's intention.
""You want me? To drink and eat with my captor and accompany you before suicide?""
""It is not suicide that will end me but your passage into the underworld, or wherever it is that you have come from, after battling creatures and evil like you, then I could only see darkness as my peace.""
The demon lets out an intrigued sigh and peers back through the peephole.
""I'll tell you what, Favvy, you've got yourself a deal. Then I can return the favor of hosting you in my domain, for all eternity."" Fabrizio grasps the key and yells back to the demon, ""Your wicked trickery and sickness will no longer hold me prisoner in my own home; the nightmares, the sounds, the visions! And it was all because of you! So, you win, but I go on my terms, and that is peacefully.""
""Alright, alright, fine, whatever you say, Favvy. We'll go where you want to go; it just goes to show that the boogeyman was too much for your old self."" Fabrizio had said nothing but began reaching for the lock. The room had been silent this whole time, but Fabrizio could hear the wind building around him; it felt like it was rushing past his ears and swirling around him. The wind, like a vacuum, receded into the cell room and blew the heavy steel door open. Fabrizio was struck and flew into the wall on the other side of the basement. He felt the impact but was not inflicted with pain. He lay still, not out of fear, but some invisible force kept him pressed to the floor. Fabrizio managed to turn his head toward the open cell; the door had swung open and unhinged, causing it to hang to one side. The air had been thin, but suddenly it was filled with footsteps. The steps had gotten closer to Fabrizio and grown louder, CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP.
The steps grew closer, and a match had struck itself to light a now appearing cigar. Fabrizio's body was lifted from the ground, lifted like a rag doll, and kept his head straight toward the floating cigar. The invisible figure had gotten closer and drawn the cigar to its mouth, blowing smoke into Fabrizio's face. The smoke had cloaked Fabrizio entirely and sent him through a now-formed tunnel of smoke, and a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. Fabrizio approached cautiously and walked toward the light. The closer he drew, the more he was able to figure out what made the light. He got to the end and, before he knew it, had realized it was the doorway back to his kitchen. Fabrizio entrusted the familiar surroundings and walked through. The kitchen light was on but started to flicker; it shuddered, then glowed brighter.
""How do you know you're not already dead?"" The demon's voice broke the dead air and emerged from the darkness. The figure walked around Fabrizio and took the seat across from him. ""Well, for one, I know you like to torture your victims on any chance you find. But I present what your believers do whenever they need their evil to cease, as a matter of peace and a celebration of the beginning to my end. I know you are a taker of souls and judge humankind, but the work keeps the peace. Just as mine had kept peace from the likes of you; hellfire, lust, goblins, werewolves, gypsy vampires, and it took all that to get to you. So I see then, as I see now, that there was only ever darkness whenever I needed light.""
The demon sat back and peered through the shadow covering his face; his attire was from an earlier era, almost Prohibition-like, and his demeanor seemed grimly approachable yet with hidden, dangerous intent. The demon's hands lost their humanity toward his fingers; they grew longer than the average man's, as if one finger was sewn to another at the knuckle; his nails were gray, practically dead-like, and serrated like a shark's teeth.
""Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Favvy, but there is light and a god. But he did not choose you; the moment of your downfall, Hell inherited your soul. That night, I attacked you, in possession of that sweet girl; it was supposed to be the end of your life.""
Fabrizio got up from the table; he sensed the conversation had not been hostile but almost a confession. ""Would you mind if I switched on a light? My eyesight is not what it once was.""
""If you do, then I must change form. How would you like to see me?"" Fabrizio turned toward the demon, and the creature peered back into eye contact; ""Just as a regular man, because of you, I was never able to call someone a friend. The life of chasing your wretched soul left me lonely to my death.""
Fabrizio leaned over and flicked the switch; within the blink of an eye, the creature morphed into the younger Fabrizio, Padre Fabrizio.
""You know what they say, the best kind of company is your own."" The demon had kept its demented eyes and demon hands; it seemed that being away from other souls had diminished its ability to form fully. The creature poured a glass of zinfandel for Fabrizio and himself. ""Ya'know? The only thing I liked about Italy was the wine; everything else I had done was purely business, and after encountering you, well, let's say I found another favorite thing about it.""
Fabrizio had started to cook the dinner, a thick seafood alfredo with a rosemary seasoning,
Fabrizio drained the pasta and poured the sauce into the pot. ""My friend, you know your way around the stove. Why hadn't I smelled a delicacy like this, while imprisoned in the shoe box I called home?""
""Probably because I had no occasion to cook, being alone for so many years, there had not been a chance for company, and I do not think I would be able to explain your growls and moaning from the basement, it sounded like a dog in pain."" The demon slammed the table and growled an insult in Latin; this did not frighten Fabrizio. At one point, it was all he heard at night. ""So whenever I was hungry, I left this haunted place for a soup kitchen in town, I washed bowls afterwards, and tried to be out as late as possible."" 
The demon had sat back and listened to Fabrizio; he finished his glass and lit a cigar. ""Do you know my name, Fabrizio? I think if we are sharing it all one last time, I'd like to be called by my name instead of Demon or Creature, it is very annoying."" Fabrizio set out the utensils and placed two plates on the table, set out napkins, and sat across from the demon.
""Your name is Nefario, commonly known as the Shadow Man, judgment demon for the devil, and tasked to pass judgment on humans through dreams and premonitions. Worshippers offer what I do tonight; to rid you of your torment or to ask you for your judgment on their enemies.""
Fabrizio took a couple of bites of Alfredo, and Nefario only sipped his wine, 
""Do not forget the possessions, which is a big no-no in the Fire Man's book."" Nefario chuckled and flashed a sharp grin.
Fabrizio had patted his mouth clean and placed the napkin on the side of his plate, ""And you were tasked to seek me out, why? Out of the billions of people on holy Earth?"" Nefario had taken a couple of bites of Alfredo and picked his bottom teeth with the fork.
""That's exactly why Favvy, because you think this land is holy, the lies and sins that man commits must all be punished, because your judgment is too soft. I had to make you kill that girl to make you impure and only worthy of the gates of hell-"" Nefario reached and grabbed Fabrizio's hands, lunged forward, and stared into his eyes. Fabrizio had seen him in this light before, once when he had to push him back into the cell after one of his tricks; those yellow eyes had now turned red, and the creature's pupils widened so much that Fabrizio could make out his own reflection.
""SINCE YOU KILLED HER, YOU NO LONGER HOLD A PURE SOUL! YOU WILL BURN BECAUSE YOUR GOD NO LONGER HOLDS FAITH IN YOU!""
Stiff. Frozen. Almost dead, Fabrizio could only stare back, for he had witnessed and vanquished all dark forces; for that, this did not faze him either. He could only see this reaction as no more than a child's tantrum than a threat.
""For that is his judgment, then it shall be his will.""
They both remained sitting and staring at each other for what seemed like hours, and in this moment, Fabrizio noticed that Nefario's eyes had lost their rage, like a candle being snuffed out. 
For the next thirty minutes, it was quiet. Fabrizio finished his food while Nefario only stared at him. He put out the cigar hanging from his mouth and collected the plates and glasses, placed them into the sink, and turned to Fabrizio. ""Well, we had our chat, I ate your food and drank your wine. I think it is about time to finish up the arrangement.""
Fabrizio had stood from the chair and pushed the chair tucked under the table, ""You might be right, Nefario, you just might be right."" Fabrizio walks into the hallway toward his front door, and behind him, the kitchen light turns off. Fabrizio was no longer afraid; he hummed an old lullaby his mother used to sing to him. He passed underneath the hall light and exploded over his head, sending glass and sparks crashing against the walls and Fabrizio's shoulders. Fabrizio had kept walking and came to the front door, 
""My fate does not end with you, for this conversation was to make amends to my creator and finally be accepted back into his grace. I banish you, demon, back to the hell you came from."" 
Fabrizio turns the doorknob and immediately burns his hand. Fabrizio had not reacted but only looked at the burn on his palm, and the burn had branded him with a pentagram.
Fabrizio begins to cry; a tear falls onto the burn and sizzles into mist. Out of thin air, a grandfather clock begins to ring its bell. The bells ding and ring throughout the house; they fill Fabrizo's home and his consciousness. Fabrizio cries, wails, then lets himself fall to the ground and lies in a fetal position.
Then a slow chuckle builds in his throat; almost uncontrollably, Fabrizio begins to laugh, but not in amusement, but in fear. His laugh begins to occur maniacally, and he gets up from the floor and begins to walk down the hallway to the basement door, he stumbles and grabs onto the doorway; the door had been opened for him, and his laugh grew louder and developed into shouts as he walked toward the opening cell door in the basement, fire begins to build and erupt out of the cell. Fabrizio tries to fight whatever power is pushing him into the inflamed cell. Fabrizio's laugh continued, but tears and expressions around the grin showed his terror at the fire about to consume him, but he stopped. Staring into the eye of hellfire, he sees damned souls screaming and wailing from their torment. Fabrizio started to breathe heavily in a panic, and a cold pair of hands grabbed the back of his neck,
""Your soul IS MINE!!""
Fabrizio is thrown into the cell. The door swung shut, and the house lights popped. Now, the house was quiet. All noise ceased, and the air had died with Fabrizio.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

So I recently (2 weeks ago) got a Ninja Luxe Cafe (the Signature one from Costco) and its been really hit or miss when it comes to espresso. The coffee I'm using is the Lava espresso from Costco and my grind jumps from 17 to 19 after every shot, never stays consistent. When it pulls a shot, it either delivers 1oz or 2 oz of espresso (im using the double shot basket) and so I'm just a little confused. Also ive noticed that when its griding, there are grounds that get stuck in the chute and so I have to clear it out before I do a grind.

I'm sorry for unloading, ive been using a Breville Barist Pro for like the last year so Im not a total newbie when it comes to espresso.

Im open to any and all suggestions!

I was told I have up to a $1k usd budget for my Christmas gift, which is great!

I have a crappy grinder and sometimes get the Illy preground stuff. Usually I use a pressurized basket. Anyway, my question is: should I replace this machine and get a better grinder (both for 1k or under), or do I keep the bambino and get a much nicer grinder? Would you also be able to supply some recommendations? Something not super loud and jarring would be a big bonus as well.

When I applied, uni accomodation was stupidly expensive and my funding is not great, so I ended up renting a small room about 35 minutes away by bus. Financially it made sense. Socially it feels like I accidentally put myself on hard mode. Most of the people on my course live in halls or in those giant student buildings near campus. They go to pres together, cook together, just knock on each others doors when something is happening. I only see my flatmates in the kitchen for 3 minutes when someone microwaves food, we are all on different schedules and no one is from my course. By the time I get home after lectures, everyone just wants to close their door and put headphones in. I honestly thought I was pretty outgoing before, but here I feel like the weird outsider who always arrives from somewhere else and leaves first for the last bus. 

I am trying not to just sit and complain, so I have done the ""right"" things people always recommend. Joined a couple of societies during freshers, follow the big group chats, went to a few events. The problem is that most people already seem to have their core mates from halls, and the conversation is a lot of ""oh yeah we all live in X block"". At society stuff we chat during the activity, but then everyone peels off in their hall groups to cook together or get ready for a night out. If I do go out with them, I always have to keep an eye on the time, because missing the last bus would mean a pretty expensive Uber for me. That makes me the person who is like ""sorry I have to leave at 11"", which isnt exactly the fun spontanous vibe. Staying over in halls is awkward because I dont know people well enough yet, and I am not trying to be the rando asking to crash on someones floor. I also cant really just ""hang around campus"" all evening, since I am carrying my laptop, books and random groceries half the time. The result is that my days are full of quick, surface level interactions but no one I would text just to go for a coffee. It already makes me anxious about second year housing, because everyone keeps forming friend groups for houses and I am here like, hi, I exist too. For anyone who was in a similar situation - living off campus or commuting - did you manage to build proper friendships at your UK uni. What actually worked for you beyond the generic ""join societies"" advice, and how do you deal with the feeling that the real social stuff happens back in halls after you have already left the area.",1,1765479424.0,UniUK,1,1.0,False
1pk5ppa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pk5ppa/curtain_call/,Curtain Call,"The light flicks on over a flight of basement steps; the single lightbulb illuminates the stairway that descends to the dark but not vacant basement. The only sound was the light bulb's hum. Fabrizio opens the door and steps down the stairs; the creaks echo off the walls with every step until he reaches the bottom. Even though he felt winded;
Once one is at his old age, they'd need to take a moment to breathe, but this night was of too much importance. Fabrizio is approaching his older years, about seventy-seven, and his stature is tall, with an average build; his hair is a coffee brown, which does not age, unlike his body. Once dedicated to being a man of the cloth, he was, but after an altercation with a demon in his early life, he devoted his life to hunting down the demon who stripped him of his faith. After exercising most of Italy, battling werewolves in Romania, and reversing Gypsy curses from France to Poland, he had found the time to end his days fighting the darkness and descend into his own end.
Fabrizio flips a switch to turn on a light above a heavy cell door at the other side of the basement. The door was highly irregular compared to the rest of the area, although it had been so empty, it had stuck out from the surrounding concrete walls and dirt floor. There were no openings, and it resembled the door of an isolation tank in prison. The only opening was accessible only from the outside and was only wide enough to see a pair of eyes. Fabrizio brought a chair that sat in what seemed to be the only dark area of the basement, brought it to the front of the door, and shifted the eye hole open. He walks back to the chair and looks at the door,
""I was nineteen when I started to learn the good book. When I was growing up, my parents fell on hard times and struggled to parent effectively. But I began reading the Bible and sought to find purity and godliness in man. Some odd years later, I had been granted residency in Italy for one of their many cathedrals. One late night, I was attending the church and started picking up after the last mass when a young woman walked in. That night, there had been a terrible storm, so bad that it was only right to dismiss the mass early because the church had almost flooded. But she seemed to be perfectly dry. I bid her a good evening, but she ignored me. She walked into the confessional, and I walked into the booth on the other side."" A low, heavy boding growl had emerged from the darkness inside the cell and rumbled through the door.
""I stared through the divider just watching her and asked if I was able to help her, ""For this is the house of God and all who repent may be absolved of their sin."" The growling had come to a stop, and earthly stomps approached the door, and a voice bellows,
""And what did she say, Favvy?""
Fabrizio had been frozen with fear, but realized he could relax, because he posed more of a threat to the demon behind than the beast to him. ""Well, she had asked for forgiveness and said her last confession had been a month ago. So I asked her what sin she had been asking forgiveness for, to which she said it was the murder of a priest. She lunged through the dividing wall and pushed me through the booth. We fought on the church floor, she bit off my ear and some of my fingers, until I grew angry and struck her in the heart with the cross of my rosary.""
The voice lowered its aggression and spoke to Fabrizio, "" Oh, Favvy, we all make mistakes; you did the right thing. The poor girl couldn't handle my possession anyway."" The demon wholeheartedly laughed, and Fabrizio was quiet. He got up and dug a key from the pocket of his slacks. ""That night is when I devoted my life to tracking you down, and within my dark journey throughout my years was only to damn you back to hell from where you've come from."" The demon shifted to the peephole and peered with his glowing reptile-like eyes. ""And all those gypsies had big mouths, which I will punish after I’m done with you!"" Fabrizio held the key to the door and spoke with assurance, ""Demon, tonight, I will let you free to accompany me for some whiskey, dinner, and cigars. I have decided that it is time for me to lay myself to my final rest. I am too old to live on, you continue possession not just on me but in my home, we settle tonight in peace so you can take me to the after, and you may be free."" The demon raised an eyebrow and questioned Fabrizio's intention.
""You want me? To drink and eat with my captor and accompany you before suicide?""
""It is not suicide that will end me but your passage into the underworld, or wherever it is that you have come from, after battling creatures and evil like you, then I could only see darkness as my peace.""
The demon lets out an intrigued sigh and peers back through the peephole.
""I'll tell you what, Favvy, you've got yourself a deal. Then I can return the favor of hosting you in my domain, for all eternity."" Fabrizio grasps the key and yells back to the demon, ""Your wicked trickery and sickness will no longer hold me prisoner in my own home; the nightmares, the sounds, the visions! And it was all because of you! So, you win, but I go on my terms, and that is peacefully.""
""Alright, alright, fine, whatever you say, Favvy. We'll go where you want to go; it just goes to show that the boogeyman was too much for your old self."" Fabrizio had said nothing but began reaching for the lock. The room had been silent this whole time, but Fabrizio could hear the wind building around him; it felt like it was rushing past his ears and swirling around him. The wind, like a vacuum, receded into the cell room and blew the heavy steel door open. Fabrizio was struck and flew into the wall on the other side of the basement. He felt the impact but was not inflicted with pain. He lay still, not out of fear, but some invisible force kept him pressed to the floor. Fabrizio managed to turn his head toward the open cell; the door had swung open and unhinged, causing it to hang to one side. The air had been thin, but suddenly it was filled with footsteps. The steps had gotten closer to Fabrizio and grown louder, CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP.
The steps grew closer, and a match had struck itself to light a now appearing cigar. Fabrizio's body was lifted from the ground, lifted like a rag doll, and kept his head straight toward the floating cigar. The invisible figure had gotten closer and drawn the cigar to its mouth, blowing smoke into Fabrizio's face. The smoke had cloaked Fabrizio entirely and sent him through a now-formed tunnel of smoke, and a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. Fabrizio approached cautiously and walked toward the light. The closer he drew, the more he was able to figure out what made the light. He got to the end and, before he knew it, had realized it was the doorway back to his kitchen. Fabrizio entrusted the familiar surroundings and walked through. The kitchen light was on but started to flicker; it shuddered, then glowed brighter.
""How do you know you're not already dead?"" The demon's voice broke the dead air and emerged from the darkness. The figure walked around Fabrizio and took the seat across from him. ""Well, for one, I know you like to torture your victims on any chance you find. But I present what your believers do whenever they need their evil to cease, as a matter of peace and a celebration of the beginning to my end. I know you are a taker of souls and judge humankind, but the work keeps the peace. Just as mine had kept peace from the likes of you; hellfire, lust, goblins, werewolves, gypsy vampires, and it took all that to get to you. So I see then, as I see now, that there was only ever darkness whenever I needed light.""
The demon sat back and peered through the shadow covering his face; his attire was from an earlier era, almost Prohibition-like, and his demeanor seemed grimly approachable yet with hidden, dangerous intent. The demon's hands lost their humanity toward his fingers; they grew longer than the average man's, as if one finger was sewn to another at the knuckle; his nails were gray, practically dead-like, and serrated like a shark's teeth.
""Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Favvy, but there is light and a god. But he did not choose you; the moment of your downfall, Hell inherited your soul. That night, I attacked you, in possession of that sweet girl; it was supposed to be the end of your life.""
Fabrizio got up from the table; he sensed the conversation had not been hostile but almost a confession. ""Would you mind if I switched on a light? My eyesight is not what it once was.""
""If you do, then I must change form. How would you like to see me?"" Fabrizio turned toward the demon, and the creature peered back into eye contact; ""Just as a regular man, because of you, I was never able to call someone a friend. The life of chasing your wretched soul left me lonely to my death.""
Fabrizio leaned over and flicked the switch; within the blink of an eye, the creature morphed into the younger Fabrizio, Padre Fabrizio.
""You know what they say, the best kind of company is your own."" The demon had kept its demented eyes and demon hands; it seemed that being away from other souls had diminished its ability to form fully. The creature poured a glass of zinfandel for Fabrizio and himself. ""Ya'know? The only thing I liked about Italy was the wine; everything else I had done was purely business, and after encountering you, well, let's say I found another favorite thing about it.""
Fabrizio had started to cook the dinner, a thick seafood alfredo with a rosemary seasoning,
Fabrizio drained the pasta and poured the sauce into the pot. ""My friend, you know your way around the stove. Why hadn't I smelled a delicacy like this, while imprisoned in the shoe box I called home?""
""Probably because I had no occasion to cook, being alone for so many years, there had not been a chance for company, and I do not think I would be able to explain your growls and moaning from the basement, it sounded like a dog in pain."" The demon slammed the table and growled an insult in Latin; this did not frighten Fabrizio. At one point, it was all he heard at night. ""So whenever I was hungry, I left this haunted place for a soup kitchen in town, I washed bowls afterwards, and tried to be out as late as possible."" 
The demon had sat back and listened to Fabrizio; he finished his glass and lit a cigar. ""Do you know my name, Fabrizio? I think if we are sharing it all one last time, I'd like to be called by my name instead of Demon or Creature, it is very annoying."" Fabrizio set out the utensils and placed two plates on the table, set out napkins, and sat across from the demon.
""Your name is Nefario, commonly known as the Shadow Man, judgment demon for the devil, and tasked to pass judgment on humans through dreams and premonitions. Worshippers offer what I do tonight; to rid you of your torment or to ask you for your judgment on their enemies.""
Fabrizio took a couple of bites of Alfredo, and Nefario only sipped his wine, 
""Do not forget the possessions, which is a big no-no in the Fire Man's book."" Nefario chuckled and flashed a sharp grin.
Fabrizio had patted his mouth clean and placed the napkin on the side of his plate, ""And you were tasked to seek me out, why? Out of the billions of people on holy Earth?"" Nefario had taken a couple of bites of Alfredo and picked his bottom teeth with the fork.
""That's exactly why Favvy, because you think this land is holy, the lies and sins that man commits must all be punished, because your judgment is too soft. I had to make you kill that girl to make you impure and only worthy of the gates of hell-"" Nefario reached and grabbed Fabrizio's hands, lunged forward, and stared into his eyes. Fabrizio had seen him in this light before, once when he had to push him back into the cell after one of his tricks; those yellow eyes had now turned red, and the creature's pupils widened so much that Fabrizio could make out his own reflection.
""SINCE YOU KILLED HER, YOU NO LONGER HOLD A PURE SOUL! YOU WILL BURN BECAUSE YOUR GOD NO LONGER HOLDS FAITH IN YOU!""
Stiff. Frozen. Almost dead, Fabrizio could only stare back, for he had witnessed and vanquished all dark forces; for that, this did not faze him either. He could only see this reaction as no more than a child's tantrum than a threat.
""For that is his judgment, then it shall be his will.""
They both remained sitting and staring at each other for what seemed like hours, and in this moment, Fabrizio noticed that Nefario's eyes had lost their rage, like a candle being snuffed out. 
For the next thirty minutes, it was quiet. Fabrizio finished his food while Nefario only stared at him. He put out the cigar hanging from his mouth and collected the plates and glasses, placed them into the sink, and turned to Fabrizio. ""Well, we had our chat, I ate your food and drank your wine. I think it is about time to finish up the arrangement.""
Fabrizio had stood from the chair and pushed the chair tucked under the table, ""You might be right, Nefario, you just might be right."" Fabrizio walks into the hallway toward his front door, and behind him, the kitchen light turns off. Fabrizio was no longer afraid; he hummed an old lullaby his mother used to sing to him. He passed underneath the hall light and exploded over his head, sending glass and sparks crashing against the walls and Fabrizio's shoulders. Fabrizio had kept walking and came to the front door, 
""My fate does not end with you, for this conversation was to make amends to my creator and finally be accepted back into his grace. I banish you, demon, back to the hell you came from."" 
Fabrizio turns the doorknob and immediately burns his hand. Fabrizio had not reacted but only looked at the burn on his palm, and the burn had branded him with a pentagram.
Fabrizio begins to cry; a tear falls onto the burn and sizzles into mist. Out of thin air, a grandfather clock begins to ring its bell. The bells ding and ring throughout the house; they fill Fabrizo's home and his consciousness. Fabrizio cries, wails, then lets himself fall to the ground and lies in a fetal position.
Then a slow chuckle builds in his throat; almost uncontrollably, Fabrizio begins to laugh, but not in amusement, but in fear. His laugh begins to occur maniacally, and he gets up from the floor and begins to walk down the hallway to the basement door, he stumbles and grabs onto the doorway; the door had been opened for him, and his laugh grew louder and developed into shouts as he walked toward the opening cell door in the basement, fire begins to build and erupt out of the cell. Fabrizio tries to fight whatever power is pushing him into the inflamed cell. Fabrizio's laugh continued, but tears and expressions around the grin showed his terror at the fire about to consume him, but he stopped. Staring into the eye of hellfire, he sees damned souls screaming and wailing from their torment. Fabrizio started to breathe heavily in a panic, and a cold pair of hands grabbed the back of his neck,
""Your soul IS MINE!!""
Fabrizio is thrown into the cell. The door swung shut, and the house lights popped. Now, the house was quiet. All noise ceased, and the air had died with Fabrizio.

Preface: I'm a severe emetophobe and have been my whole life but I understand that this procedure is necessary for me to not have a panic attack every single day over bloat-related nausea. 

My studio (for work) is in crunch to get everything approved before the Christmas holidays, so I've been treating my body like shit to keep up with the deadlines (coffee, Adderall, all-nighters... fellow artists, you relate?). I'm writing this with 0 sleep, though I am planning on sleeping EARLY today to at least be somewhat rested for the procedure.

On top of that I'm having some sort of allergy going on right now and my whole chest eyes and face are inflamed and itchy, and I'm swallowing a lot of mucus causing tons of nausesa on top of everything. Especially my chest feels hot and itchy and I keep having dry coughs. I think the lack of sleep is making my immune response stronger (I haven't had environmental allergies like this in years, and never in December, so that's another thing worrying me).

I'm freaking myself out that sleeping only every other day in the 2 weeks leading up to the procedure will make my recovery hell. As in I will throw up everywhere and my immune system will be so shot that I'll straight up die from... the anesthesia... asphyxiation.....heart attack?!?!?!

Now, I'm seeing a lot of people talk about regurgitation, nausea, and even vomiting in some cases (possibly even from the anesthesia?!?!) and I'm terrified that the current state of my body will make me a billion times more likely to vomit (or just GENERALLY be miserable).

Anyone have experience or semi-scientific input that I can apply to this situation to confirm that I will, indeed not die going under tomorrow? 😩 Thank you in advance!!!",1,1765479379.0,noburp,1,1.0,False

This might be a bit confusing so please bear with me. It is important to note that my husband who is a US marine was on deployment during this time. I wanted a divorce during this time. He is not a good husband, and I found him paying for only fans which is what led me to having an affair with a man who we’ll call ✨David✨ (to protect his privacy). I dated David in high school but then broke up with him when I met my husband. (Messed up, I know.)

I still do want a divorce sometimes from my husband but now is not an ideal time. Yes he knows about the affair.

I started seeing David again when I went back to my hometown to stay with my parents while my husband was on deployment. In May of this year I had a manic episode that went into psychosis. Before I was even into the psychosis, I started telepathically communicating with David. But when I asked him about it, he denied it. Then, I fell asleep (while he was at my house one night late at night) and before he left, he left me a note that said “I had a great time tonight, hopefully we can keep communicating without words :)”. I wasn’t sure if he was just teasing me and playing along with it, or if he actually meant it.

(Note: I was taking adderall at the time for ADHD, very likely could have played a chemical role in some of this experience. Regardless, I have VERY similar experiences to lots of the TI stories I have read).

Moving forward, we keep texting everyday, but we can’t see each other, because my dad won’t let me see him. We miss each other very much but have to be content with texting, snap chatting and talking on the phone whenever I could sneak it. We are still telepathically communicating at this point, and he tells me (telepathically) that he can see what I’m seeing. As in, he can see through my eyes. I’m not sure why, but at the time I didn’t question it, because it already felt so natural to be telepathically communicating, it just felt like it made sense. And strange coincidences kept happening, like after he would tell me something telepathically, he would text me something slightly related or a smiley face immediately after, or would sometimes answer my text immediately after I sent him a thought telepathically. Like, too soon to be a coincidence. And he was working during these times we were texting so most of the time he would take a little bit to respond (he’s a fire protection engineer).

During this time, I increasingly started believing in God, and very clearly heard God speaking to me. I was always praying, and audibly heard him answering my prayers (other people could not hear this). I was texting David about God, and telling him to pray for things. I would constantly bring up John 14:14 which says “ask for anything in my name, and I shall do it”. I believed that so fiercely. I was constantly praying, asking in Jesus’s name. I truly believed that miracles were on the verge of happening, and that he was going to answer all of my prayers of getting to see David soon, making my infertile aunt become pregnant, help my dad become healthier, etc. (I know this just sounds like psychosis, which it probably was, but I’m getting to a point.)

Eventually I start listening to a band that I never ever listened to before, or anything like it. It’s a post hardcore band. I never used to listen to music like that. (David’s favorite band, he’s obsessed with them, he even has a tattoo of the bands name on his chest. I made fun of him in high school for listening to them, and I would not listen with him) Anyway, I immediately fell in love with this band and their music, like, I stayed up all night listening to it the first night I discovered them. (Manic behavior, I know.) The following few days, I started telepathically communicating with the lead singer of the band, and we started ‘casting out demons’ together, and I strongly believed that a lot of their songs on one of their old albums were about me, and that we were twin souls. The lead singer told me that he has been watching me since I was young, and that he would watch me extra closely through the eyes of my boyfriend when we met in high school. I was constantly asking him (telepathically) if this was actually real, and if he could really see what I was seeing. He would tell me (in a perfectly audible voice that only I could hear) exactly what I was doing and what was in front of me. And anytime I felt any emotion, he would be like ‘what’s wrong, why are you sad’ etc. and things like that.

Anyway, I would pray to God in rhymes, and he would answer with a rhyme. Here’s an example:

Me: “Jesus, I feel sick.”

Jesus: “Close your eyes, and just ask Rick.”

(Rick being the lead singer of the band)

When I said ‘sick’ it meant I was feeling that demons were near/I was sensing their negative energy. Not physically sick.

Then I would close my eyes and see “Rick” (very, very vividly) and say:

Me: “Rick, I feel sick”

Him: “The gouge your eyes, do it quick!”

And I would push my fingers against my eyelids and press down until i couldn’t take the pain anymore. This was a compulsion that I did for several weeks, thinking that it was helping something. I believed that the ‘demons’ fed off my pain, and the pain attracted them, and in turn I was exposing them/“killing them”. I even put perfume in my eyes. I believed I was turning my eyes into ‘snake eyes’ because I was becoming a disciple, taking this verse literally: Matthew 10:16 - “therefore be shrewd as snakes and innocent as doves”.

I know this is so strange and doesn’t seem to make much sense. I hope I am describing it correctly.

I went to a psych ward a few days after I started telepathically communicating with the singer, not because I thought I needed to, but to make my family feel better.  They put me on an antipsychotic, but I still continued to hear the voice of God and telepathically communicate with the singer. And for some reason, I kept wanting to drink a bunch of straight black coffee, because I had an obsession with keeping my body ‘acidic’ so I could ‘feel more electricity’.

Does anyone have any idea what this might have been? I know a lot of people say I was hearing voices because I was in a state of psychosis, and I don’t disagree with that. But I remember everything so clearly, these voices were so vivid, and the images I was seeing were extremely vivid as well, as if I was going somewhere else in my mind whenever I closed my eyes. I don’t have any personal or family history of  s c h i t z o p h r e n i a. 

I still feel that I can telepathically communicate sometimes. But I try not to focus on it a lot, because I’m trying to just keep my mental health stable. I live near a military base and there are constantly helicopters flying over my house.",1,1765479289.0,SurveillanceStalking,0,1.0,False

I’m genuinely happy today — after months of feedback, rewiring layouts, and rethinking way too many screens, I finally shipped a big UI update to my app **DayTrace** (habit + event + timer tracker).

[New Daytrace UI](https://preview.redd.it/modh13n2gm6g1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=9237c8c44e6b68e1baf3221854f597eb5e2a591c)

A lot of people kept telling me the same two things:

* *“The history is useful… but hard to reach.”*
* *“Please add streaks and goals!”*

And honestly, they were right. So I sat down and rebuilt the experience from the ground up: cleaner navigation, a unified daily view, visual streaks, personal goals for any tracker, and a much more intuitive creation flow.

It’s still the same app at its core — but now it feels faster, clearer, and (I hope!) nicer to use. As a solo dev, hitting “publish” on an update like this feels huge, so I wanted to share that excitement with people who get it.

If you’re into habit tracking or just curious about the redesign, feel free to check it out or tell me what you’d improve next. I’m always listening!

1pk5m81,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EazyWrites101/comments/1pk5m81/curtain_call/,Curtain Call,"The light flicks on over a flight of basement steps; the single lightbulb illuminates the stairway that descends to the dark but not vacant basement. The only sound was the light bulb's hum. Fabrizio opens the door and steps down the stairs; the creaks echo off the walls with every step until he reaches the bottom. Even though he felt winded;
Once one is at his old age, they'd need to take a moment to breathe, but this night was of too much importance. Fabrizio is approaching his older years, about seventy-seven, and his stature is tall, with an average build; his hair is a coffee brown, which does not age, unlike his body. Once dedicated to being a man of the cloth, he was, but after an altercation with a demon in his early life, he devoted his life to hunting down the demon who stripped him of his faith. After exercising most of Italy, battling werewolves in Romania, and reversing Gypsy curses from France to Poland, he had found the time to end his days fighting the darkness and descend into his own end.
Fabrizio flips a switch to turn on a light above a heavy cell door at the other side of the basement. The door was highly irregular compared to the rest of the area, although it had been so empty, it had stuck out from the surrounding concrete walls and dirt floor. There were no openings, and it resembled the door of an isolation tank in prison. The only opening was accessible only from the outside and was only wide enough to see a pair of eyes. Fabrizio brought a chair that sat in what seemed to be the only dark area of the basement, brought it to the front of the door, and shifted the eye hole open. He walks back to the chair and looks at the door,
""I was nineteen when I started to learn the good book. When I was growing up, my parents fell on hard times and struggled to parent effectively. But I began reading the Bible and sought to find purity and godliness in man. Some odd years later, I had been granted residency in Italy for one of their many cathedrals. One late night, I was attending the church and started picking up after the last mass when a young woman walked in. That night, there had been a terrible storm, so bad that it was only right to dismiss the mass early because the church had almost flooded. But she seemed to be perfectly dry. I bid her a good evening, but she ignored me. She walked into the confessional, and I walked into the booth on the other side."" A low, heavy boding growl had emerged from the darkness inside the cell and rumbled through the door.
""I stared through the divider just watching her and asked if I was able to help her, ""For this is the house of God and all who repent may be absolved of their sin."" The growling had come to a stop, and earthly stomps approached the door, and a voice bellows,
""And what did she say, Favvy?""
Fabrizio had been frozen with fear, but realized he could relax, because he posed more of a threat to the demon behind than the beast to him. ""Well, she had asked for forgiveness and said her last confession had been a month ago. So I asked her what sin she had been asking forgiveness for, to which she said it was the murder of a priest. She lunged through the dividing wall and pushed me through the booth. We fought on the church floor, she bit off my ear and some of my fingers, until I grew angry and struck her in the heart with the cross of my rosary.""
The voice lowered its aggression and spoke to Fabrizio, "" Oh, Favvy, we all make mistakes; you did the right thing. The poor girl couldn't handle my possession anyway."" The demon wholeheartedly laughed, and Fabrizio was quiet. He got up and dug a key from the pocket of his slacks. ""That night is when I devoted my life to tracking you down, and within my dark journey throughout my years was only to damn you back to hell from where you've come from."" The demon shifted to the peephole and peered with his glowing reptile-like eyes. ""And all those gypsies had big mouths, which I will punish after I’m done with you!"" Fabrizio held the key to the door and spoke with assurance, ""Demon, tonight, I will let you free to accompany me for some whiskey, dinner, and cigars. I have decided that it is time for me to lay myself to my final rest. I am too old to live on, you continue possession not just on me but in my home, we settle tonight in peace so you can take me to the after, and you may be free."" The demon raised an eyebrow and questioned Fabrizio's intention.
""You want me? To drink and eat with my captor and accompany you before suicide?""
""It is not suicide that will end me but your passage into the underworld, or wherever it is that you have come from, after battling creatures and evil like you, then I could only see darkness as my peace.""
The demon lets out an intrigued sigh and peers back through the peephole.
""I'll tell you what, Favvy, you've got yourself a deal. Then I can return the favor of hosting you in my domain, for all eternity."" Fabrizio grasps the key and yells back to the demon, ""Your wicked trickery and sickness will no longer hold me prisoner in my own home; the nightmares, the sounds, the visions! And it was all because of you! So, you win, but I go on my terms, and that is peacefully.""
""Alright, alright, fine, whatever you say, Favvy. We'll go where you want to go; it just goes to show that the boogeyman was too much for your old self."" Fabrizio had said nothing but began reaching for the lock. The room had been silent this whole time, but Fabrizio could hear the wind building around him; it felt like it was rushing past his ears and swirling around him. The wind, like a vacuum, receded into the cell room and blew the heavy steel door open. Fabrizio was struck and flew into the wall on the other side of the basement. He felt the impact but was not inflicted with pain. He lay still, not out of fear, but some invisible force kept him pressed to the floor. Fabrizio managed to turn his head toward the open cell; the door had swung open and unhinged, causing it to hang to one side. The air had been thin, but suddenly it was filled with footsteps. The steps had gotten closer to Fabrizio and grown louder, CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP.
The steps grew closer, and a match had struck itself to light a now appearing cigar. Fabrizio's body was lifted from the ground, lifted like a rag doll, and kept his head straight toward the floating cigar. The invisible figure had gotten closer and drawn the cigar to its mouth, blowing smoke into Fabrizio's face. The smoke had cloaked Fabrizio entirely and sent him through a now-formed tunnel of smoke, and a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. Fabrizio approached cautiously and walked toward the light. The closer he drew, the more he was able to figure out what made the light. He got to the end and, before he knew it, had realized it was the doorway back to his kitchen. Fabrizio entrusted the familiar surroundings and walked through. The kitchen light was on but started to flicker; it shuddered, then glowed brighter.
""How do you know you're not already dead?"" The demon's voice broke the dead air and emerged from the darkness. The figure walked around Fabrizio and took the seat across from him. ""Well, for one, I know you like to torture your victims on any chance you find. But I present what your believers do whenever they need their evil to cease, as a matter of peace and a celebration of the beginning to my end. I know you are a taker of souls and judge humankind, but the work keeps the peace. Just as mine had kept peace from the likes of you; hellfire, lust, goblins, werewolves, gypsy vampires, and it took all that to get to you. So I see then, as I see now, that there was only ever darkness whenever I needed light.""
The demon sat back and peered through the shadow covering his face; his attire was from an earlier era, almost Prohibition-like, and his demeanor seemed grimly approachable yet with hidden, dangerous intent. The demon's hands lost their humanity toward his fingers; they grew longer than the average man's, as if one finger was sewn to another at the knuckle; his nails were gray, practically dead-like, and serrated like a shark's teeth.
""Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Favvy, but there is light and a god. But he did not choose you; the moment of your downfall, Hell inherited your soul. That night, I attacked you, in possession of that sweet girl; it was supposed to be the end of your life.""
Fabrizio got up from the table; he sensed the conversation had not been hostile but almost a confession. ""Would you mind if I switched on a light? My eyesight is not what it once was.""
""If you do, then I must change form. How would you like to see me?"" Fabrizio turned toward the demon, and the creature peered back into eye contact; ""Just as a regular man, because of you, I was never able to call someone a friend. The life of chasing your wretched soul left me lonely to my death.""
Fabrizio leaned over and flicked the switch; within the blink of an eye, the creature morphed into the younger Fabrizio, Padre Fabrizio.
""You know what they say, the best kind of company is your own."" The demon had kept its demented eyes and demon hands; it seemed that being away from other souls had diminished its ability to form fully. The creature poured a glass of zinfandel for Fabrizio and himself. ""Ya'know? The only thing I liked about Italy was the wine; everything else I had done was purely business, and after encountering you, well, let's say I found another favorite thing about it.""
Fabrizio had started to cook the dinner, a thick seafood alfredo with a rosemary seasoning,
Fabrizio drained the pasta and poured the sauce into the pot. ""My friend, you know your way around the stove. Why hadn't I smelled a delicacy like this, while imprisoned in the shoe box I called home?""
""Probably because I had no occasion to cook, being alone for so many years, there had not been a chance for company, and I do not think I would be able to explain your growls and moaning from the basement, it sounded like a dog in pain."" The demon slammed the table and growled an insult in Latin; this did not frighten Fabrizio. At one point, it was all he heard at night. ""So whenever I was hungry, I left this haunted place for a soup kitchen in town, I washed bowls afterwards, and tried to be out as late as possible."" 
The demon had sat back and listened to Fabrizio; he finished his glass and lit a cigar. ""Do you know my name, Fabrizio? I think if we are sharing it all one last time, I'd like to be called by my name instead of Demon or Creature, it is very annoying."" Fabrizio set out the utensils and placed two plates on the table, set out napkins, and sat across from the demon.
""Your name is Nefario, commonly known as the Shadow Man, judgment demon for the devil, and tasked to pass judgment on humans through dreams and premonitions. Worshippers offer what I do tonight; to rid you of your torment or to ask you for your judgment on their enemies.""
Fabrizio took a couple of bites of Alfredo, and Nefario only sipped his wine, 
""Do not forget the possessions, which is a big no-no in the Fire Man's book."" Nefario chuckled and flashed a sharp grin.
Fabrizio had patted his mouth clean and placed the napkin on the side of his plate, ""And you were tasked to seek me out, why? Out of the billions of people on holy Earth?"" Nefario had taken a couple of bites of Alfredo and picked his bottom teeth with the fork.
""That's exactly why Favvy, because you think this land is holy, the lies and sins that man commits must all be punished, because your judgment is too soft. I had to make you kill that girl to make you impure and only worthy of the gates of hell-"" Nefario reached and grabbed Fabrizio's hands, lunged forward, and stared into his eyes. Fabrizio had seen him in this light before, once when he had to push him back into the cell after one of his tricks; those yellow eyes had now turned red, and the creature's pupils widened so much that Fabrizio could make out his own reflection.
""SINCE YOU KILLED HER, YOU NO LONGER HOLD A PURE SOUL! YOU WILL BURN BECAUSE YOUR GOD NO LONGER HOLDS FAITH IN YOU!""
Stiff. Frozen. Almost dead, Fabrizio could only stare back, for he had witnessed and vanquished all dark forces; for that, this did not faze him either. He could only see this reaction as no more than a child's tantrum than a threat.
""For that is his judgment, then it shall be his will.""
They both remained sitting and staring at each other for what seemed like hours, and in this moment, Fabrizio noticed that Nefario's eyes had lost their rage, like a candle being snuffed out. 
For the next thirty minutes, it was quiet. Fabrizio finished his food while Nefario only stared at him. He put out the cigar hanging from his mouth and collected the plates and glasses, placed them into the sink, and turned to Fabrizio. ""Well, we had our chat, I ate your food and drank your wine. I think it is about time to finish up the arrangement.""
Fabrizio had stood from the chair and pushed the chair tucked under the table, ""You might be right, Nefario, you just might be right."" Fabrizio walks into the hallway toward his front door, and behind him, the kitchen light turns off. Fabrizio was no longer afraid; he hummed an old lullaby his mother used to sing to him. He passed underneath the hall light and exploded over his head, sending glass and sparks crashing against the walls and Fabrizio's shoulders. Fabrizio had kept walking and came to the front door, 
""My fate does not end with you, for this conversation was to make amends to my creator and finally be accepted back into his grace. I banish you, demon, back to the hell you came from."" 
Fabrizio turns the doorknob and immediately burns his hand. Fabrizio had not reacted but only looked at the burn on his palm, and the burn had branded him with a pentagram.
Fabrizio begins to cry; a tear falls onto the burn and sizzles into mist. Out of thin air, a grandfather clock begins to ring its bell. The bells ding and ring throughout the house; they fill Fabrizo's home and his consciousness. Fabrizio cries, wails, then lets himself fall to the ground and lies in a fetal position.
Then a slow chuckle builds in his throat; almost uncontrollably, Fabrizio begins to laugh, but not in amusement, but in fear. His laugh begins to occur maniacally, and he gets up from the floor and begins to walk down the hallway to the basement door, he stumbles and grabs onto the doorway; the door had been opened for him, and his laugh grew louder and developed into shouts as he walked toward the opening cell door in the basement, fire begins to build and erupt out of the cell. Fabrizio tries to fight whatever power is pushing him into the inflamed cell. Fabrizio's laugh continued, but tears and expressions around the grin showed his terror at the fire about to consume him, but he stopped. Staring into the eye of hellfire, he sees damned souls screaming and wailing from their torment. Fabrizio started to breathe heavily in a panic, and a cold pair of hands grabbed the back of his neck,
""Your soul IS MINE!!""
Fabrizio is thrown into the cell. The door swung shut, and the house lights popped. Now, the house was quiet. All noise ceased, and the air had died with Fabrizio.

But personally I've noticed stark contrast between the types of coffee having different effects.

I have this one cheap grocery store brand instant coffee (GSC) and one cheap walmart brand instant coffee (WMC), I noticed with the GSC no matter how much I take, it doesn't seem to wake me up as much, like it doesn't give me much of a cognitive boost, and I've tried to just take more to the point where it just keeps making my heart race and gives my body a lot of energy, yet my mind would still be tired. Meanwhile the WMC gives me more of a cognitive boost and I don't have to go to the doses that make my heart want to jump out of my chest. 

I also sometimes make ground coffee in a 3 cup moka pot (usually 30g), and thats what wakes me up the most. 

So I don't think its just about the caffeine dose, but seems like different kinds of caffeine that maybe cross the blood brain barrier and ones that don't?  ",3,1765479108.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

1pk5e7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/GangstalkingTruth/comments/1pk5e7v/my_husband_is_a_us_marine_please_help_me_find_out/,My husband is a US marine. Please help me find out if I am/have been a TI. Idk if he’s in on it,"Am I/have I been a targeted individual? I am desperate to know.

This might be a bit confusing so please bear with me. It is important to note that my husband who is a US marine was on deployment during this time. I wanted a divorce during this time. He is not a good husband, and I found him paying for only fans which is what led me to having an affair with a man who we’ll call ✨David✨ (to protect his privacy). I dated David in high school but then broke up with him when I met my husband. (Messed up, I know.)

I still do want a divorce sometimes from my husband but now is not an ideal time. Yes he knows about the affair.

I started seeing David again when I went back to my hometown to stay with my parents while my husband was on deployment. In May of this year I had a manic episode that went into psychosis. Before I was even into the psychosis, I started telepathically communicating with David. But when I asked him about it, he denied it. Then, I fell asleep (while he was at my house one night late at night) and before he left, he left me a note that said “I had a great time tonight, hopefully we can keep communicating without words :)”. I wasn’t sure if he was just teasing me and playing along with it, or if he actually meant it.

(Note: I was taking adderall at the time for ADHD, very likely could have played a chemical role in some of this experience. Regardless, I have VERY similar experiences to lots of the TI stories I have read).

Moving forward, we keep texting everyday, but we can’t see each other, because my dad won’t let me see him. We miss each other very much but have to be content with texting, snap chatting and talking on the phone whenever I could sneak it. We are still telepathically communicating at this point, and he tells me (telepathically) that he can see what I’m seeing. As in, he can see through my eyes. I’m not sure why, but at the time I didn’t question it, because it already felt so natural to be telepathically communicating, it just felt like it made sense. And strange coincidences kept happening, like after he would tell me something telepathically, he would text me something slightly related or a smiley face immediately after, or would sometimes answer my text immediately after I sent him a thought telepathically. Like, too soon to be a coincidence. And he was working during these times we were texting so most of the time he would take a little bit to respond (he’s a fire protection engineer).

During this time, I increasingly started believing in God, and very clearly heard God speaking to me. I was always praying, and audibly heard him answering my prayers (other people could not hear this). I was texting David about God, and telling him to pray for things. I would constantly bring up John 14:14 which says “ask for anything in my name, and I shall do it”. I believed that so fiercely. I was constantly praying, asking in Jesus’s name. I truly believed that miracles were on the verge of happening, and that he was going to answer all of my prayers of getting to see David soon, making my infertile aunt become pregnant, help my dad become healthier, etc. (I know this just sounds like psychosis, which it probably was, but I’m getting to a point.)

Eventually I start listening to a band that I never ever listened to before, or anything like it. It’s a post hardcore band. I never used to listen to music like that. (David’s favorite band, he’s obsessed with them, he even has a tattoo of the bands name on his chest. I made fun of him in high school for listening to them, and I would not listen with him) Anyway, I immediately fell in love with this band and their music, like, I stayed up all night listening to it the first night I discovered them. (Manic behavior, I know.) The following few days, I started telepathically communicating with the lead singer of the band, and we started ‘casting out demons’ together, and I strongly believed that a lot of their songs on one of their old albums were about me, and that we were twin souls. The lead singer told me that he has been watching me since I was young, and that he would watch me extra closely through the eyes of my boyfriend when we met in high school. I was constantly asking him (telepathically) if this was actually real, and if he could really see what I was seeing. He would tell me (in a perfectly audible voice that only I could hear) exactly what I was doing and what was in front of me. And anytime I felt any emotion, he would be like ‘what’s wrong, why are you sad’ etc. and things like that.

Anyway, I would pray to God in rhymes, and he would answer with a rhyme. Here’s an example:

Me: “Jesus, I feel sick.”

Jesus: “Close your eyes, and just ask Rick.”

(Rick being the lead singer of the band)

When I said ‘sick’ it meant I was feeling that demons were near/I was sensing their negative energy. Not physically sick.

Then I would close my eyes and see “Rick” (very, very vividly) and say:

Me: “Rick, I feel sick”

Him: “The gouge your eyes, do it quick!”

And I would push my fingers against my eyelids and press down until i couldn’t take the pain anymore. This was a compulsion that I did for several weeks, thinking that it was helping something. I believed that the ‘demons’ fed off my pain, and the pain attracted them, and in turn I was exposing them/“killing them”. I even put perfume in my eyes. I believed I was turning my eyes into ‘snake eyes’ because I was becoming a disciple, taking this verse literally: Matthew 10:16 - “therefore be shrewd as snakes and innocent as doves”.

I know this is so strange and doesn’t seem to make much sense. I hope I am describing it correctly.

I went to a psych ward a few days after I started telepathically communicating with the singer, not because I thought I needed to, but to make my family feel better.  They put me on an antipsychotic, but I still continued to hear the voice of God and telepathically communicate with the singer. And for some reason, I kept wanting to drink a bunch of straight black coffee, because I had an obsession with keeping my body ‘acidic’ so I could ‘feel more electricity’.

Does anyone have any idea what this might have been? I know a lot of people say I was hearing voices because I was in a state of psychosis, and I don’t disagree with that. But I remember everything so clearly, these voices were so vivid, and the images I was seeing were extremely vivid as well, as if I was going somewhere else in my mind whenever I closed my eyes. I don’t have any personal or family history of schizophrenia.

I still feel that I can telepathically communicate sometimes. But I try not to focus on it a lot, because I’m trying to just keep my mental health stable. I live near a military base and there are constantly helicopters flying over my house.",1,1765478660.0,GangstalkingTruth,0,1.0,False
1pk5e1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1pk5e1o/a_thought_on_tbm_spouses/,A thought on TBM spouses,"People in these subs often talk about how hard it is to still have the TBM spouse and all the emotional turmoil you have to go through. It's real. I've been there.
Sometimes we forget the emotional turmoil of our TBM spouses as their partner deconstructs and changes from the TBM person they fell in love with into something new. New isn't bad. But it's so hard on them too. They hold on to the structure that gave them comfort, sometimes even harder than they would if YOU were the TBM. Someone has to hold on and win you back/protect the kids, etc.
The church is brutal with the lies and guilt and holding people in.
I just hope everyone remembers how ""in"" they were at whatever point and treat your spouse with the same charity you want from them.
Even when they were TBM, my wife stayed by me, supported my decisions, and loved me for me. In that toughest of times, she was my rock. I made many mistakes and pushed more than I should have, but I also understood that I couldn't change everything overnight. I still went to church. I didn't complain that she wanted to tithe. I didn't try coffee right away, or change our relationship dynamics, I've still never tried alcohol and I won't unless she does it with me.
But over time, we both relaxed, she knew I was leaving church and not her, she heard things I was reading or listening to, and then suddenly we were back on the same page, though this often means we share each others' pain at the lies and betrayal of the church.  It still hurts, but less when we're on the same page.
Above all, be the person that your spouse will want to choose over the church. It's so easy to fall into anger and bitterness, and then project those feelings onto the person who still doesn't see the lies. I have never regretted avoiding that instinct.",14,1765478648.0,exmormon,3,0.95,False

1pk5axr,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1pk5axr/chapter_7_home_adult_dark_fantasy_words_2509/,Chapter 7: Home  [adult dark fantasy words 2509],"**Context:** Chapter 7 of a grimdark serial intended for Royal Road. \~2,500 words.

**The Story:** Grigori is a former Nightwatchman who shares his body with Kragg, a primal beast that emerges when he loses control. After fleeing Steinricht to understand what he's becoming, he returns to find his closest friend — and discovers everyone believes he's dead.

**Content:** Body horror, crude humor, implied violence. No combat in this chapter.

**What I'm looking for:** Brutal honesty on pacing. This is a setup chapter — does the tension hold without a fight? Do the new characters (Boris, Nadya) land, or do they feel flat? Is the Grigori/Kragg internal dynamic working?

**CHAPTER 7: HOME**

Grigori shuffled across the floor. Marta slept in the hammock swaying with the rocking of the packet on the Black Rush. Sleep escaped him. They'd purchased travel upriver to Steinricht, the cursed city. Sailors called it that. Sailors disappeared in the dark alleys there.

Kragg stayed quiet. Not sleeping, just huddled in the back of Grigori's thoughts.

""You there, big man?""

A grunt.

""Yeah, me too.""

Marta snored, then coughed, then silent.

Kragg chuckled.

Grigori opened the door, ascended the staircase, and walked onto the deck.

The night air skipped across the river, cold and wet. It carried the stink of silt and the foul stench of dead things, dead fish. A darker shadow passed under the waves, under the packet. The Black Rush ran slow here, fighting its own current as it pushed north. Stars hung low, too dim to light the moonless sky, but luminous enough to cast eerie shadows.

A man stood at the rail. Not too tall, broad shoulders, thick hands that gripped the wood of the rail. He didn't turn when Grigori's weight made the deck groan.

""Can't sleep either?"" The voice was rough. River-rough and filled with grief.

""No,"" Grigori said.

""You looking for a fuck?"" The man looked up at Grigori.

""No.""

""Good. Last lad was. Sent him below with a bloodied nose."" The man rubbed his fist.

*I like him.*

""Good. I'd probably have done worse.""

*Yes. He'd be meat for the fishies.*

Grigori almost smiled. Kragg attempting humor. It never landed right.

Dark eyes stared at the river. He watched the dark things beneath the waves.

""Boris."" He didn't offer a hand.

""Grigori.""

*Kragg.*

Long silence spread thick. The packet rocked and creaked. Water lapped at the hull, then slapped with larger waves.

""You stopping at Steinricht, or moving on?"" Boris asked.

""Stopping.""

""Should consider moving on.""

""Why?""

""Cursed city."" He spat something dark and oily over the rail, wiped the rust-colored spit from his lips with the sleeve of his shirt. ""Sailors call it that. Men go in. They don't come out or they come out wrong."" His grip tightened on the wood. ""My brother went in. Worked the docks. Good man. Strong.""

He stopped. Swallowed something hard. Something that didn't go down easy.

""They..."" He squeezed harder, turning his head away from Grigori. ""They found him on Hollows Lane. Near the sailor taverns."" Boris's voice flattened. ""Looked like he'd been dead a hundred years. Skin like paper. Eyes like raisins.""

Silence. Then, ""But he'd only been missing three days.""

*The Jack.*

Grigori said nothing. Let the man talk.

""They say it's disease. Plague. Something in the water."" Boris shook his head. ""I've seen plague. Plague doesn't leave puncture wounds.""

Grigori listened. Didn't say anything.

""You sure you don't want to fuck?"" Boris looked Grigori straight in the eyes.

Grigori said nothing. Didn't move. He remembered Anabeth. The whores that followed her death. Fucking didn't make the hurt stop, and it didn't quell the grief.

""I'm sorry."" Boris turned to leave.

""Wait."" Grigori spoke.

Boris stopped. He didn't turn.

""Whatever killed your brother wasn't a man."" His voice came low, quiet. The voice he used when Kragg surfaced.

Boris turned now. Eyes wet but jaw hard.

""I know what men do. I've seen it."" Grigori stepped closer. Their faces inches apart. The weathered planks groaned with his weight. ""If you go hunting Hollows Lane with a knife and rage, you'll end up like him.""

Boris's fist clenched, teeth grinding against teeth. ""You telling me to walk away?""

""No. I'm telling you what you're walking into."" Their eyes locked, two desperate men.

*Tell him.*

""The thing feeds. It wears a man's shape in the dark. It's not a man. It won't die like one.""

Boris held his gaze, felt the heat of his breath. He looked for the lie. Didn't see it.

""How do you know?""

Grigori's stare told him everything he needed to know in that awkward silence.

Boris nodded. Slow. The way men do when they've heard something they don't want to believe.

""I'm still going.""

""I know.""

*He'll die.*

""Don't hunt it alone.""

""You sure you don't want to fuck? I won't break your nose."" Boris's voice had softened. Less proposition, more plea.

""No. But if you need company, I'll sit with you.""

""Drink then?""

""I can do that. Whiskey?""

""No. Rum.""

Grigori thought of Aedrin then. Kragg purred.

They drank on the deck until the stars faded. Didn't talk much. Didn't need to. Two men sitting with their grief, letting the river carry them toward something neither could name.

Dawn bled grey over the water. Mist clung to the surface like a burial shroud.

Steinricht rose from the fog.

Grigori stood at the rail. The city looked the same — black spires, factory smoke, the steeple of St. Elara cutting the sky. But he saw it differently now. The sigils carved into old stone. The pulse beneath the streets. The things that had always been there, waiting.

*Home.*

Not home. Not anymore.

Boris appeared beside him. Sober now. Hard-eyed.

""Hollows Lane,"" he said. Not a question.

""Don't hunt it alone.""

Boris didn't answer. Just walked down the gangplank and disappeared into the crowd.

Grigori watched him go.

*He'll die.*

""Maybe.""

Marta's hand found his arm. ""Who was that?""

""A dead man walking.""

She didn't ask more.

They stepped off the boat and into the city.

Marta led the way through streets lined with brick and timber-framed storefronts. Bricks red and plaster brushed white. Tobacco drifted from the tobacconist they passed. Pastries, glazed in honey, sugar, and cinnamon, lined the glass-fronted bakery nestled next to a bookstore, and across the street, a coffee shop's smells mingled with the distinct aroma of eucalyptus, camphor, and juniper from the apothecary. Marta stopped there.

""This is it."" Marta smiled, a short-lived one. She rubbed her hands on her skirt.

*Why is she just standing there?*

""You okay?""

""It's just..."" She bit her lower lip. ""We haven't spoken to one another in years.""

The door flung open. A tall man dressed in a pressed uniform stared at them. A small bell sounded above the door. Stannard. Grigori stared back.

He watched the man shift his gaze to Marta, a tick or two of the clocktower's brass hands. Then they shifted back to Grigori. He moved from his face, over the thick neck, rolling shoulders, flat of his stomach, hips, then lingered on the bulge of his overly tight trousers. His gaze too obvious. He assessed him as threat and competition.

""I thought you were leaving,"" a soft voice chimed from inside.

""No, I think I'll wait. Just letting in some fresh air,"" Stannard said, eyes still locked on Grigori.

Marta snorted. ""You moving or standing there all day?""

Stannard blinked, then moved aside.

""Madame."" His eyes didn't leave Grigori. ""New to Steinricht?""

""Something like that."" Grigori grunted.

*Still want to punch his head through the wall.* Kragg snorted.

Shelves lined with glass bottles filled with liquids of every color, dried leaves, seeds, and berries. Amidst the shelves, small tables displayed bottles of perfume. But under the juniper, Grigori smelled it — antiseptic and the copper tang of blood. From the back room, shuffling and groaning.

Stannard moved to the back. Silent and swift.

Marta glanced at Grigori, then followed. He tagged behind.

Antiseptic and alcohol. Burned their nostrils.

Stannard stood next to Nadya. Too close. She pretended not to notice. Grigori tasted bitter-sweet, saw the tension in her neck, the stiffness of her shoulders.

*She lies good. Too good.*

Grigori nodded agreement.

Nadya stepped closer to a man lying on a table against the wall. Nightwatch blue, stained dark. His coat had been unbuttoned and pulled aside, the shirt beneath stained red, blurring into the white linen, ripped and also pulled aside exposing a torso that should be lean and strong. He'd sunk to the bones. Wrong. Paper thin and grey. His cheeks sunk over jaw. Eyes deep in his skull. Dull. His neck had a ring of teeth marks, and on his chest as well.

Brannic. Grigori didn't see the corpse; he saw the grin of the kid who grinned too much. The one that always asked questions. Always eager to please.

Kragg shifted, looked to Nadya.

Marta closed the distance. Grabbed Nadya's wrist. ""No. Not that."" She pulled the salve container from her hand. ""That will shorten his life.""

""You've seen this?""

Marta nodded. ""Once. Back at Kettle Bend.""

""If he speaks, I need to hear it. It's evidence."" Stannard moved closer.

""Shut up."" Nadya glared at him. ""I learned from this woman. My Aunt."" Her words were venom.

Stannard's breath staggered.

Grigori half grinned, one corner lifting so slightly.

*Said I liked her.*

Grigori nodded.

Brannic's eyes opened, drifted to the doorway, found Grigori. ""Big man."" He grinned. A thin chuckle slid across his withered lips.

""Enough."" Marta whispered, placing a hand to his forehead. Fever hot. ""He's a strong one.""

""Boy, move out of my way. I don't have time for pleasantries."" She bumped Stannard aside, grabbed three jars from the table, mixed the ingredients and began to grind them. ""Nadya, I need spotted toadstools.""

Nadya dashed to the front room shoving Grigori aside. ""Move it, or make yourself useful.""

*She's got bite.* Kragg grinned.

Grigori growled, then purred.

Nadya stepped beside Boris who counted coin and had a collection of remedies spread on the counter; silver dust, iron flakes, a pound of crystal salt, a chunk of belladonna, and crushed ash tree bark. ""Excuse me, sir."" She grabbed a basket of spotted toadstools and returned to Marta.

Grigori moved to the counter. Boris looked up.

""Arming yourself?""

""Best I can."" Boris gestured at the supplies. ""Old wives' tales. Silver for werewolves. Iron for fae. Salt for spirits."" He shrugged. ""Don't know what kills the thing on Hollows Lane. Figured I'd try everything.""

""Smart.""

""Desperate."" Boris wrapped the belladonna in cloth. ""You find lodging yet?""

""No.""

""Chandler's Row. Third door, green paint peeling. Landlady's name is Veka. Tell her Boris sent you."" He dropped coins on the counter. ""Room next to mine. Walls are thin, but she doesn't ask questions.""

On the table, Brannic winced. ""Vladovich? You said you'd train me.""

""What was that, Brannic?"" Stannard leaned in closer. ""You know he died that night. Maulhammer got him.""

Nadya pushed him aside, hard. ""I told you to move it. We are trying to save a life here.""

Stannard bowed his head, gritted his teeth and moved away. ""Yes, ma'am.""

""You, big guy. Throw me that towel."" Nadya ordered. Stannard's face flushed red.

Grigori reached for the towel and threw it to Nadya.

*She likes you.* Kragg approved.

*Boris respects you too. Look at him, watching your every move. Pretending not to.*

Grigori stole a glance back at Boris.

She was already back at the table.

Stannard stepped closer to Grigori. Too close. Chest puffed, chin raised.

""I didn't catch your name, stranger.""

Grigori looked down. He opened his mouth to answer.

Kragg stepped closer, bared a half-cocked toothed grin. ""Kragg."" A low growl followed.

Marta stepped up. ""He's my protector.""

Stannard didn't flinch. ""From what?""

""From danger."" Kragg said. ""From dangerous men."" He rolled his shoulders.

Grigori watched. *Not the time or place, Kragg.*

""One, two, three."" Kragg counted, wanted to be unleashed. He knew better.

""That a threat?""

""No threat. Wouldn't waste my time."" Kragg shoved past. ""Marta. The boy?""

Marta looked back at Brannic, then to Nadya. ""He's going to be fine with rest and some nursing.""

""Safe now."" Kragg purred.

Grigori sighed.

""Kragg."" Stannard repeated the name. Didn't like it. ""Strange name.""

Marta snorted. ""So's Stannard. He's from the eastern territories. Our families go way back.""

Nadya's head raised. One eyebrow lifted. She said nothing.

Stannard's eyes narrowed. He looked at Grigori's face. Really looked. Searching for something he couldn't find.

*He feels it. Doesn't know what.* Kragg thought.

*Good. Let him wonder.* Grigori answered.

Boris stepped beside Grigori, placed a hand on his arm. ""I'm headed out. See you tonight.""

Kragg reached his hand up, placed it over Boris's. ""I'll be there."" He turned his gaze away from Stannard and focused on Boris. ""We've got monsters to pursue.""

""That's the watch's job."" Stannard interrupted.

""Not doing good at it."" Boris rumbled.

Stannard stepped back. ""Don't get in the way of the Nightwatch's duty. Could find yourself behind bars. Don't interfere.""

Boris shrugged off Stannard's warning. Gathered his supplies. Nodded once to Grigori, once to Nadya. Left. The bell chimed.

""Stannard."" Nadya's voice ripped through the air. ""Stop with the bravado. These are paying customers and friends of the family."" She shot a knowing look to Marta. Marta didn't dodge the gaze.

""If the boy is fine, I leave him in your hands. I'll be back to check on him later."" He said nothing more to the strangers. Opened the door. The bell chimed. He stepped into the streets of the High Ward. The door closed behind him.

Grigori watched the door close behind Stannard.

*Still don't like him.*

""He's a good watchman. Too arrogant. Cock's too small and it chafes him.""

Kragg laughed. *Then he really hates us.*

""Yeah."" A smug smile crossed Grigori's face.

He turned to face Marta. Nadya.

""You look older,"" Nadya said.

""I am, girl.""

""You could've written.""

""Nothing to say that a letter could hold."" Marta didn't flinch. ""And you? Why didn't you write?""

Nadya turned away using the boy as an excuse. She checked his pulse, wiped his head, and cleaned his wounds. Her fingers trembled.

""You staying?"" Grigori said. Not a question.

Marta nodded. ""She needs help with the boy. And we have..."" She glanced at Nadya. ""Things to discuss.""

*We need to go. We need to find him.*

Grigori moved to the door. Stopped.

""The watchman. Warsaw."" He kept his voice flat. ""Where do I find him?""

Nadya's hands stilled on Brannic's chest. She didn't turn.

""Did you know Vladovich?""

""I do. I did.""

""Then you know Warsaw."" She straightened. Faced him. Her green eyes found his face. ""He resigned. After the hunt. After they told him his friend was dead.""

Grigori knew the truth. Remembered him standing on the pier that night.

Kragg remained still. He remembered, too.

""Where?""

""The old tenement."" She wiped her hands on the cloth. ""He's not the same. Doesn't sleep. Comes to me for tinctures and draughts to help him stay awake. Speaks of shadows and things in them.""

*We left him.*

*I left him. I left him alive.*

*Not enough. Coward.* Kragg snarled. Rolled his shoulders.

Nadya stepped closer. She stared into those black-haloed grey eyes. ""You're the one in my dreams. The one with something else inside.""

Marta heard. Didn't move or say anything.

Kragg stirred. Wary.

Grigori held her gaze. Didn't deny it.

""Take care of the boy. Tell me of any changes."" He turned. Reached for the door.

Nadya let him leave. ""Welcome home,"" she whispered under her breath.

The bell chimed. The door closed behind him.

Outside.

""Yes. Home.""

1pk5a0a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pk5a0a,"New Profitec Go owner: sour shots, channeling, and how I finally fixed it","I recently got a Profitec Go last week with firmware v1.09 and it took me way longer than I’d like to admit to sort out the taste of my espresso. Decided to share what I found so other new owners don’t have to go down the same rabbit hole.



**1. E1 Temp:** First problem I had was getting very sour shots, no matter what I have tried, increasing dose, increasing yield, waiting for the machine to heat up for at least 30 minutes, did not solve my issue. I have fixed this by adjusting the E1 setting. E1 setting is the offset temperature between your boiler and brew temp, so it means that if you set you PID at 93°C, your boiler runs at 93°C+ E1 offset temperature. **By default, this is set at 14°C (or 25°F) on some machines, and increasing this to 18°C (or 32°F) resolved the issue.** You can access this setting during the initial startup of the machine, when you switch on the machine(during firmware version is displayed), quickly hold - and + buttons on the PID and navigate to E1 setting using the - button. when you are at the E1 setting, press the + button and increase the temp. That is all. It is shocking that this is not mentioned in the manual.

**2. Loosening the shower screen:** You can also get channeling when the shower screen is installed too tight from factory. Apparently this is quite common. Once you realize this, the first thing to do is to loosen the shower screen with an hex key.

**3. Dispersion Plate aligning with the water exit hole in group head:** When the dispersion plate aligns with the hole on the entry of group head(during machine assembly at the factory), this will cause a big channeling on the side of the puck. **To fix this, you need to loosen the screw that attaches the shower screen and the dispersion plate to the group head, and rotate it a little bit, then screw it back but not too tight.** I have read on reddit on how to fix it, but without pictures it was a little hard to understand. So I took some pictures. 

**4. Getting a ""flatter"" basket:** The basket that comes with the machine is not bad, but I also realized that it also contributed to my sour espresso. The OG basket has a curved(narrow) bottom which always resulted in uneven water flow through the coffee puck. I have inspected the puck every time I pulled the my shots, and towards the narrow edges of the basket, the puck always had a darker color, which means the main water flow was through there. My puck prep routine includes RDT,WDT and a self leveling tamper, however it did not fix this issue. **I ended up getting a 20-22GR IMS basket, which does not narrow down, and that fixed the issue.** I have also added the picture of the pucks with the IMS basket and OG basket side to side(IMS on the left, OG on the right).



Overall, I’m happy with the machine now, but getting it dialed in took way more time and energy than I expected.



I hope this thread helps the future owners of this machine. Happy brewing!",12,1765478391.0,ProfitecGo,7,0.88,False

I have close friends all who I love a lot, as well as a sister and future sisters-in-law that I adore as well. But we’re a little older to get married (36), our friends have all done all the bridal party things over the years, and I just want to keep the day simple. I don’t want anyone to worry about any obligations, I simply want them to attend the wedding and have a great time - no need to be anywhere at a particular time or wear a particular thing. We also live thousands of miles away from them, so I don’t want anyone to feel pressured to plan or attend any kind of pre-wedding bachelorette events. I do still want to celebrate with them, and make sure our families have seats set aside, but the thought of coordinating more beyond that feels stressful for me and gives them more things to have to do.

I plan on inviting my closest friends and family to get ready in the room with me if they’d like, and I’d like to have a little breakfast bar and coffee for them to come and go while spending time together that morning if they’d like but, again, no obligations.

I know this also means my partner will probably not have a grooms party since I’m not having a bridal party. He has a lot of close friends and a brother, and I know if I did have a formal bridal party, he’d like to have groomsmen and a best man. He’s really understanding and flexible, and said he’s not hung up on it and doesn’t mind not having one if I don’t. But I do know my decision impacts him a bit too.

I'm pretty new to the idea that there is significant variance in the quality of espresso that you can get or make.

In the last couple of weeks, I've been trying to use all the various processes that people recommend and I feel like I'm at least making progress, albeit limited progress, in terms of the consistency of my output and the way the puck comes out when all else is finished.

However, I keep expecting there to be a moment where, taste wise, it all suddenly makes sense, but thus far, I'm not really tasting anything that tastes significantly different to any espresso I've ever had at your run of the mill Italian restaurant post-dinner or at your standard third-wave coffee shop. Some that I made were probably on the sour end (seeing someone describe it as lemony, helped me identify that profile) but I've tried changing the grind size and ratio since then and I feel I'm back to similar slightly bitter espresso like what I've had in the aforementioned places.

I can tell the difference between a dark roast/burnt drink you'd get at the chain coffee shops Vs one you'd get at one of the better independent places, but that's quite a low bar, right?

I think the thing is though, I'm not sure I even have the pallete to distinguish a good espresso from an average espresso in the first place. Or maybe I've just never tried a really good espresso before and that means I'm only comparing against average espressos. Maybe if I have a really good one, it will all just click... I dunno...

I understand that I'm limited by the quality of my equipment (Sage/Breville pro grinder being the biggest culprit) but I can get decent quality beans here in Ireland and I have ordered a Kingrinder K6, which hopefully will make a difference. Maybe then I'll see the light?

For the real espresso pros on here, was there a single drink where it just suddenly made sense for you? Is it really obvious when you drink a great espresso Vs a not so great one?

I want to get better but the truth is, I don't really know what I'm looking out for. I don't know if it's a subtle thing or a super obvious thing.

Also, I tend to drink cortados and flat whites (not in the past couple of weeks when I've been trying to up my game). Is it basically pointless to put so much effort into dialing in the espresso if I'm just going to add milk to it? Or can you still really taste the difference?

Sorry for the essay, but I'd like to hear people's stories of how they developed their palette.

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared… had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, giving the piano one last look. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different, denser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls, portraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn’t point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn’t the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No…through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did. Widening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn’t want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn’t ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps, soft and steady, from up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.

Eventually, I found him standing at the end of the corridor, motionless. His hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn’t reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn’t look at me when I approached.

“This is the quietest part of Bellmare,” he said softly. “She breathes slowest here.”

“What is this door?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. “A mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what’s in front of it.”

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

“You talk like you’re part of this place,” I said.

“Wellers has been many things,” he answered, almost wistfully. “Concierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.” He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. “But never the composer.”

“And who is?”

“The one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.” He glanced at me. “But not all music is meant for endings. Some… simply linger.”

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn’t noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we’d stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

“Wellers,” I asked, quietly. “Is there a way out?”

He regarded me. “That depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.” He paused. “But you, Mr. Goodpray, you’ve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.”

We stood before the mirror door. It didn’t show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

“Well then,” he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. “Shall we proceed?”

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed the opposite.

And together, we stepped through.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. It was absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn’t hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. The memory of walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I’d never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire, but wasn’t. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children’s laughter from a mouthless choir.

“None of this makes sense,” I muttered.

“Wellers never promised it would,” he said beside me.

“You... you aren’t Wellers. Are you?""

A pause. “No.”

I stopped. The air stood still. “Then what are you?”

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait that hasn't fully dried.

“I’m the third son of the one who buried the stars,” he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. “I was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.”

His voice was Wellers, but not just Wellers.

“All that remained was silence,” he said. “So I filled that silence with voice. From voice, I became music—song, echo, memory. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.”

“And Wellers?”

“He let me in,” the voice replied. “Long ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.”

“What did he want to remember?”

There was a hush, like a page turning. “A girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.”

Silence settled. I didn’t push that subject further.

“You said you listened,” I said again. “But why me? Why now?”

The not-light around us shimmered, and for a moment, the corridor folded into something like water. It was navy, with a full moon hanging heavy above, its pale light fractured by waves that never broke. “You didn’t drown in your sorrows,” Wellers murmured, voice low and sure, “though many do. You faced the currents, though the depths called.”

The faint image shifted. The watery veil around us now twisted into shadows, deep and near, weighted like the blackened surface of a lake at midnight, cold and silent. “Nor did you turn away, closing yourself to the echoes that cry in silence, burying your voice beneath a silence not meant for keeping, hiding passion and love beneath the frozen dark. That kind of silence suffocates.”

I looked at him, the figure who was not quite Wellers, and waited.

“You played,” he said again, softer now, “the grief in your bones. And places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.”

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage anymore.

“Why didn’t you take me earlier?”

He turned his head just slightly. “You weren’t ready to let go.”

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded like notes played in a room with no walls.

“Is Wellers… still alive?”

“For a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.”

“And now?”

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers’ borrowed mouth.

“He’s fading. The song is softer now.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “And Claire? The real Claire?”

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

“She passed through,” the voice said. “But she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.”

I didn’t know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

“This next part,” he said, “you walk alone.”

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn’t just any place. It was ours. Claire’s scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn’t want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare’s throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace.

She didn’t look up at me.

I stepped closer. “Claire?”

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

“Hi,” she said.

I couldn’t speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

“I—I’ve missed you,” I managed.

“I know,” she said, and smiled, sad and warm. “I’ve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn’t see me.”

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

“Was it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?”

Her eyes moved to the piano. “Some places are made from grief,” she said. “And some scores stay because we keep playing them.”

“I tried to save you.”

“I know,” she whispered. “But I didn’t need saving. You did.”

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out and hovered above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

“You can let go now, Liam,” she said.

“I don’t know how.”

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

“Then just try.”

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest. This time, it wasn't jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

“Wellers,” I said.

He nodded once, eyes dark and calm.

“To leave,” he said, voice still too calm, “there must be a price to be paid.”

“I’ve paid,” I said, without hesitating. “I’ve played. I’ve wept. I’ve given her up.”

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

“Yes,” he said, voice richer now, more layered. Like a choir echoed inside his chest. “You have. And I do not keep what was freely given.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled a folded piece of paper, handing it to me silently. I unfolded it carefully, tracing the words with a finger.

“Compensation: Solace”

I placed the letter gently on the kitchen table, the same where it first appeared. The start, and end, of this circle.

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn’t seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

“Wellers is resting now,” the voice added, quieter. “He heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.”

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. The fading visage of Wellers.

Then I walked through.

The door didn’t creak as it opened. It breathed, like something sighing its last. I stepped through into air that was far too still. The sky was grey, but free of storm and smoke. It was the kind of sky the world forgot about. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn’t the aftermath of a sudden fire. No—this had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the DIN(N)ER sign left, its last flicker long gone.

The silence was total. It felt cleared, like the performance had finally ended after final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue. It was now collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia’s stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn.”*

The windows were blackened from the inside with more than just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they’d burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn’t go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car at the entrance of the town. It was dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I. 

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but this time, it wasn't malicious.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat. Framed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just… pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don’t even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper “thank you.”

But no one was there.

1pk55gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CafeStartupHelpAU/comments/1pk55gw/café_branding_that_works_name_logo_customer/,"Café Branding That Works: Name, Logo & Customer Psychology","Your café’s name and logo are **more than decoration** — they’re powerful tools that influence customer perception, trust, and behaviour. Done right, branding can help attract, retain, and convert customers before they even taste your food or drinks.

# Why Café Branding Matters

# First Impressions Shape Customer Decisions

When customers first see your café — on signage, menus, social media, or packaging — they spend **about two seconds deciding what you do**. Creativity is valuable, but if they can’t instantly tell your café type or style, that creativity is wasted.

**Tip:** Make your purpose clear immediately:

* Is it a coffee-first café or a full breakfast menu?
* Is your style modern, casual, or artisanal?
* Are you aiming to communicate speed, comfort, or premium quality?

Clarity at first glance builds trust and encourages people to step inside or engage online.

# Logo Design & Recognition

A strong, consistent logo creates **instant recognition** across all touchpoints: signage, cups, packaging, social media, and menus. Familiarity increases repeat visits and word-of-mouth referrals.

**Design tip:** Keep it simple, clean, and memorable. Avoid overly complicated designs that customers can’t recognise quickly.

# Colours & Shapes Influence Emotions

Branding isn’t just visual — it triggers **subconscious responses**:

* **Red:** stimulates appetite and energy.
* **Blue:** builds trust and calm.
* **Earthy tones:** evoke warmth and comfort.

Choosing colours and shapes aligned with your café’s personality helps influence customer behaviour from the moment they see your brand.

# Names Are Mental Shortcuts

A strong, memorable café name becomes a **shortcut for the whole experience**. Customers don’t just see your brand — they feel it. Familiarity and trust are built before the first order.

**Naming tip:** Keep it simple, easy to say, and easy to remember. Avoid obscure or overly clever names that don’t immediately convey what your café offers.

# Consistency Is Key

Ensure branding is consistent across all customer touchpoints: signage, menus, packaging, social media, and uniforms. Consistency reinforces recognition, builds trust, and strengthens your café’s identity in a crowded market.

# Some Easy Practical Café Branding Tips

1. **Name:** Simple, memorable, and relevant to your café concept.
2. **Logo:** Recognisable, clean, and reflective of your café’s style.
3. **Clarity:** Customers must understand your café’s purpose in seconds.
4. **Colours & Design:** Choose tones and shapes that evoke the emotions you want customers to feel.
5. **Consistency:** Apply your brand across every touchpoint.
6. **Test & Refine:** Gather feedback from staff and customers to ensure your branding communicates the right message.

I hope this helps!

The Clippers have been nothing short of a tragedy this season and have lost 7 of their last 8 games, while Houston has only lost 6 games all season. In addition, the Rockets have won their last two home games by double digits, and 7 of their last 9 home encounters SU. My money’s on Houston to cover.

1pk5261,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pk5261/wishing_you_safe_travels_on_your_way_back_to/,Wishing you safe travels on your way back to yourself.,"Clicking through some snapchat memories. My ex fiancé's picture rolls through that i took of him at one of my sons Christmas concert. I find my self missing him. Find myself marveling at the fact that someone who was so unkind and hurtful could still feel like home. So I thought I'd write about it.

That is the whole reason i made this reddit account. Was to see if I could try my hand at journaling out my thoughts with a potential audience. I have found myself really struggling with my mental and emotions this season. The last year has been a doozy. Not sure what has been in the air 2025. I know it's not just me either. People close to me, people in general, something about this damn year came with a lot of pain. A lot of realizations. A lot of shedding bad habits, painfully. A lot of loss... Learning lessons the damn hard way even if you knew better. 

I was in a pretty bad rollover that I miraculously walked away from with 5 broken ribs and a lacerated spleen. The vehicle I rolled was crushed like a soda can. Soft top jeep. Pretty violent rollover. I was helicoptered to a trauma hospital where I would be spending the next 6 days in a lot of fucking pain. 

A few days before this rollover I had learned that this particular ex had cheated on me from the very beginning. For some reason that hurt just as bad if not more than the rest of the shit he'd done that I knew about. Back then was when I still trusted him....before he asked me to be his wife. Back when I still believed he was a good man and would never betray me. 

For a little context without going into the whole shit show that became three years of my life I will try to explain some of the behavior and actions I went through. A lot of gaslighting. There was always other women he seemed to be involved with in some way shape or form. Nudes on his phone of other women, women he knew. Never coming home, always at the bar, and a lot of drinking. He was very mean to me. His words could be vicious bringing out the fight in me, which he would promptly use against me. Before I knew who he really was, all of this....I had already fallen in love with him. Which is not something I give lightly.... 

I love hard. Loyal. Ride or die. But I have learned that it is not always a healthy trait because when the mask fell away and he showed me who he really was I gave him another chance. I was patient. I believed there was the good man I had fallen in love with inside him somewhere and he just needed some time and grace to get back to that. I made excuses. He was going through a lot. Stressed. Maybe I needed to be more patient, understanding, be the rock that he needed. If I stood strong by his side he'd love me for it in the long run. Deep down he really loved me. He asked me to be his WIFE for god's sake. I did not take that lightly. 

What I was actually doing was allowing him to mistreat me. He was killing my spirit and snuffing my spark. I used to think I was very strong. Had a solid head on my shoulders. I was confident, assertive, driven. I let him kill that in me for a very long time and I didn't even realize it till it was too late. He was not a good man. He was a narcissist, a cheater/womanizer, a liar, he did not respect women, he did not respect me. 

After I had learned that the first infidelity was real and that was the start of it all. I was so upset at myself that I had let it get so far, so bad. That I allowed him the access to me to hurt me over and over and over. I finally blocked him. From everything. Well after the breakup he would always come back around, telling me he loved me, still wanted to marry me, still wanted me to have his children. I would let him. Every time I found myself in his arms and his bed it was like a warm blanket....like home. Just for a second all the bad things didn't matter. He loved me. He missed me. The other women would never be me.

Like how fucking sick is that?! Words cannot express the shame I have with myself that I ever let it get that mentally fucked up. That's not who I am. I didn't deserve that.... No good women deserves that. I pray that type of love never finds me again. 

So I finally cut him off. I was focusing on myself. Being a better mother. My career. I was indulging in a man that was kind to me. Was finally starting to feel like I could get back to myself again.

Then I came pretty close to dying.

The first two days in the hospital I was stuck without a phone. My father and my son would come visit, but they were going to have to go home so I was going to be by myself. On the second day my ex showed up.... Just walked in my room looking concerned. I was in a lot of pain. I found myself happy to see him. He stayed with me, sleeping in that uncomfortable hospital chair, for two days. He bought me food. He was there with me through the screams of pain from the muscle spasms. (If you've broken your ribs real good, then you know) 

Why? What is that? This man was not good to me. He had hurt me repeatedly throughout our relationship. He continued to hurt me and play games up until the moment I blocked him. Yet, here he was. Taking care of me. Being there for me. Without having to ask. That nice man I was indulging in never check on me...and I had shared a kiss with him the night of my crash. He never called, texted, nothing. A lot of people I thought cared about me, that I loved, didn't check on me. 

That was a learning experience. I really learned who my true friends were because damn did they come through for me. A lot of them didn't. I have been marinating on that as well. 

My ex stayed with me for 2 days, had to go back to work. I asked for a kiss before he left. I was in need of some loving...and it felt good to feel him. He came back on the sixth day to take me home. He had put his engagement ring on the chain around his neck I had gotten him one Christmas. Within those few days I was alone in the hospital I thought a lot about my life and how I ended up there. Even though he showed up and I was grateful he did, it didn't change all the wrong doing. All the heartbreak. All the ways in which he had never valued me before. Him putting that ring around his neck didn't mean he was going to suddenly become a good man. That's not who he is. 

So regardless, I still needed to choose me. He tried for a while. He would bring me coffee in the mornings. I was pretty incapacitated the first week home. Then he wanted me to go spend a day with him and I told him no. I haven't heard from him since. 

I know he isn't good for me and he never will be. Him being gone allows me to grow into the good things in life. Being with him was some of the most miserable years of my life. Yet I still find myself missing him. Wondering if I will ever be loved by a good man. If I deserve it. I find the psychology behind knowing how bad he is for me, still missing him, still yearning at times for him, while also hating him and never wanting to go back interesting. KNOWING that I'm better than that. KNOWING that he isn't good. KNOWING that is who he really is. Yet, still hoping that he figures that out and steps into the good I felt like he could be. For himself. Still mourning the life I thought I was going to build with him. I find myself frustrated with those emotions. That they still linger in my chest. Hoping time will make me not care so damn much.

I want to flourish and step into the bad ass woman I want to be. I know I'm capable and better things are coming. Life really knocked me into the dirt to start working my way back up. I've always been tough enough to take it. As frustrated I am that this was how everything played out, I am grateful for the opportunity to build the life I want for me and my son. I definitely feel like I am running low on my nine lives and do not intend to waste it. I got a little lost along the way...I'm embarrassed I let it happen. However, I will give myself the grace to learn from it and do better.

Brush and floss your teeth twice a day, eat three meals a day, shower once a day, brush your hair everyday, wake up early everyday, study or work almost everyday, keep every room clean as often as possible, do laundry at least 3 days a week…

I’m tired all the time. I know not eating is not helping my energy, and it’s probably making my life 10x harder. 

But whenever I think about eating I feel sick to my stomach. Eating anything feels disgusting. I don’t wanna just eat a raw salad without dressing, but when I put the dressing on all I can think about are the extra 100-200 calories I just added to something otherwise healthy. Or how even salads aren’t technically safe because if I eat spinach there’s a lot of iron and iron causes kidney stones but I have an iron deficiency so Idk what to do.  

Everything I eat is bad for me and will kill me and I’m gonna fucking die if I eat food. So I keep having days where I only consume 1k calories and half of it comes from coffee. 

Cooking takes so much energy though. Even microwaving garbage prepared meals takes 10 minutes of effort. Then I have to chew it all. And I feel like a fat disgusting pig for eating fruit. 

I’m going insane. I can’t eat anything without thinking it’s hurting me. I can’t fucking take this shit anymore. I just wanna starve and maybe I’ll get skinny. I look in the mirror and I know I’m not even overweight and yet even knowing that I still feel fat. 

I tell my therapist and she tries to tell me I’m overreacting and I don’t have an ED. I know EDs are serious but I wonder if I have OCD or something because I can’t stop obsessing over these thoughts anymore. It used to not be so bad but the thoughts keep getting worse instead of better. I. Can’t. Stop. Thinking. I keep crying when I have to eat food because I feel like I’m about to pass out and then I eat too much and now I definitely don’t have an ED because I just ate 785 calories in one sitting.

I've been single for over two years now and recently moved to a new country. Had some unsuccessful dates since coming here. That was until a guy (let's call him Dan) asked me out at random for coffee - am invitation I didn't make much of at the time but once we met we clicked on some common interest and humor. He invited me to his place the following week to ""watch Netflix"", which I totally thought would be code for sex... until we actually really watched Netflix on a rainy day and cuddled.   
  
Around that time I've also been texting one other guy (Jon) from Hinge, with which I had nice chats but they felt more like friendship-oriented. However, when I met him I found him really charming, which led to two more dates afterwards - the last one of which was a very very romantic trip date.

I think I'm starting to fall for both of them. Dan and Jon, however, are so very different from one another - in communication style, in the way they dress, chat, etc. I still haven't kissed either of them nor slept with any of them. In both situations I'm in this ""what are we/could be after the third date"" situation. 

I feel shame that I'm behaving like an attention wh--- but I really do like them both. Should I just decide and cut one of them off? Should I continue seeing both of them until I get to know them further? Any advice would be appreciated.",1,1765477479.0,askgaybros,4,0.67,False

Hi there, my mod list seems to be having an issue with building anything in just a few different areas on the map of my RimWorld playthrough. It's odd as people will deliver the resources to the spots, but then nobody will build anything. I can't even force anybody to build, as when I right-click, nothing pops up like it's even possible?   
  
Here's my mod list. If anybody is aware of some specific bug or conflict that might cause this from a mod on my list, because I'm totally stumped as to what could be behind this.

1pk4qky,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pk4qky/aita_for_kicking_my_sil_out_of_my_wedding_party/,AITA for kicking my SIL out of my wedding party because she got pregnant,"Sorry this is super long, but it’s a true story and I needed to include as much context as possible because well… this is crazy.

I (27F) got engaged in the summer of 2024 to my wonderful husband (29M). I was over the moon. The ring was absolutely stunning. He had it custom made using my stones from my Mom’s wedding band (she passed away when I was 5) and so this was a beautiful gesture. He proposed at home in our kitchen. It was perfect.

At this time, my now-SIL (31F) was one of my best friends. I grew up with only brothers and always wanted a sister, so when we met and connected the way that we did it finally felt like something I was missing had finally been found. Let’s call her G.

I idolized G, which in hindsight is kind of embarrassing to admit, but I thought she was amazing. She was so strong minded, which could sometimes be mean, but I admired that she knew herself so well. She had a strong sense of style and morals, but at the same time she could be extremely difficult. If she didn’t like something or didn’t agree with it, she would make her opinion known. As an example, if you wore something she didn’t like you’d often get “that’s so ugly” or “what are you wearing”. She definitely lacks empathy.

She is very non traditional (she and her husband eloped at city hall without telling anyone because she thinks weddings are silly) and always said she never wanted to have kids.

A few years before I got engaged, G was the maid of honour in another wedding and she absolutely hated it. She complained about every aspect of it to me and swore she never wanted anything to do with being in a wedding party ever again. Well, apparently this changed when my husband (her brother) and I got engaged.

Once we started wedding planning, G came to me and asked about my wedding party and who was going to be in it. I told her a list of names of my friends I wanted to have as my bridesmaids and to my surprise she responded with “well if you don’t make me a bridesmaid I’m going to be really offended”. I was completely taken aback by this because of how vocal she was about hating being in the wedding party she was in previously. To be honest, as much as this surprised me I was also super excited because of how close we were. The only reason I wasn’t planning to ask her was because I thought she’d say no.

So when it came time to “propose” to my bridesmaids I spent a lot of time handwriting letters to each of them talking about how much they meant to me and I chose a gift that I thought would be timeless and meaningful.

For G, I decided I wanted to do something really special since she was going to be my actual sister after the wedding. Since my fiancé took diamonds out of my mom’s wedding bands to make my engagement ring, I was left with 2 small diamonds and gold bands. I took them to a jeweller and had two matching bands made for us using the gold and diamonds. Essentially I had created what I felt was a new family heirloom, and that she and I could pass them along in our family and it was a way of having my late mom included in my “new” family.

My SIL was shocked that I got her something so special, and I really felt like I had done the same thing. I ended up asking her to be my MOH (just a title because I knew she didn’t want any of the responsibility) because it saved me from having to choose a MOH between my other friends as there had been drama between them previously. Ultimately, my SIL accepted the role of MOH with the understanding that she would only have the responsibility of a standard bridesmaid.

Fast forward to winter of 2024: my bridesmaids had started planning my bachelorette trip. I had always envisioned a Nashville bachelorette and that was what I wanted from day 1. All my friends were on board, but expressed some concerns about budget but ultimately we found some options that were affordable. I was also going to drive down there with my bridesmaids to save some money on flights. I was so, SO excited as I love anything country. It felt like my dream was coming true.

In early January my SIL and her husband, let’s call him P, asked if they could come over. We hadn’t been spending as much time together as we used to just because life got busy and they live 45 minutes away. No big deal. She had asked a couple of times previously, but we weren’t able to make it work with our schedules but she was persistent about coming over so we eventually found a time and day that worked. They arrived with Starbucks coffee that said “Aunt” and “uncle” and told us they were expecting. I was SO EXCITED! I’ve always loved kids and this was going to be the first baby in the family. Ultimately, the reason they told us was because she was pregnant she didn’t think she’d be able to come to my bachelorette as by then she would be 7 months pregnant and not comfortable travelling. I said that was no problem and I understood and because it was not as important as her health while pregnant.

Shortly after this, I reconvened with my other bridesmaids and decided to do something local instead of Nashville. This would mean that G could attend, which was really important to me, and that my other bridesmaids wouldn’t have to be stressed about spending money and the budget could be smaller.

My SIL was also worried about not knowing what size she would be to get the bridesmaid dress I had picked (she was due a couple months before my wedding). So in the end I decided to let me bridesmaids choose whatever dress they wanted to wear, as long as it was pink and floor length.

After my SIL told us she was pregnant, I made sure to regularly check in and make sure they were okay as she does have mental and physical health issues. My husband and I bought a bunch of things off the registry and tried to be as helpful as possible. My SIL, for lack of a better term, was kind of rude. When we’d ask her questions about when she was due we would be met with responses like “it’s none of your business” and “it doesn’t matter because we won’t even tell anyone when I go into labour”. We were also constantly reminded that we are “not entitled to a relationship” with their baby (our niece/nephew). All this was very confusing and hurtful because I thought that G and I were like sisters. But after she got pregnant she really started to treat me badly. She became quite obnoxious in a few ways.

She had a specific baby bouncer on her registry, which I found on sale at an auction warehouse near my work. I ended up getting it for close to 50% off and I told her we got it as a present to which she replied “no I’ll send you the money for it because I’d rather buy things that are discounted and let everyone else buy the full price stuff”.

My SIL and her husband have an older house which they are doing renovations to. Her husband needed to redo the flooring upstairs so they could start actually putting the nursery together. My SIL asked if she could stay with us over he weekend while he was doing the renovations (he’s very good at DIY) because she didn’t want to be around the dust while she was pregnant. My husband didn’t want her to come, but I said it was no problem.

The morning she was coming to stay with us she called me before she left her house and asked what I was doing. I told her I was cleaning and was about to wash the floors so they’d be dry by the time she got there. She replied with “you better not be using any chemicals or bleach to clean them because that is not good for me because I’m pregnant and it’ll make me sick”. I was frustrated because I have a cleaning routine that I am particular about but I bit my tongue said ok and instead washed my floors with vinegar. When she arrived she immediately started criticizing everything and saying that our house “smelled funny” and that my dog was “dirty” (my dog is literally my child lol). I again ignored the comments and tried to changed the subject. I started showing her some of the wedding decor and the favours I was making to which I was again met with more criticism and told that it was all very “tacky”. At this point, I knew this was going to be a long weekend.

Later that night she received pictures from her husband of all the work he had done at the house, which I thought looked great. She apparently didn’t because she called him and literally was screaming at him about how terrible of a job he did and that if it wasn’t fixed that she would call someone to rip it all up and redo it. My husband and I were absolutely appalled. The rest of the night was awkward because we were so taken aback by her behaviour, but we didn’t say anything because we didn’t want to get involved. But the way she spoke to him was truly vile.

So she stayed over and the next morning we decided we’d go to Costco. My husband told her she could stay at our house if she wanted but she insisted on coming. When we got into my husband’s truck she started freaking out about the air fresheners he had in his truck because they are “toxic” and she is pregnant (like we didn’t already know this). My husband told her he liked them and she responded by ripping them out of the air vents in HIS truck. My husband was livid. This was after she told me I needed to sit in the backseat because she doesn’t like sitting in the back because… drumroll please… she’s pregnant.

Anyway, the rest of the day was terrible because my husband was pissed at her and she ended up leaving. Some other stuff happened to make things worse but I’m going to skip over it because this story is already very long.

A few weeks later, she sends me a picture of a yellow midi dress and asks if she can wear this to the wedding as the MOH, to which I was annoyed because I had already changed the dress vision I had to accommodate her. So I told her no, to which she seemed annoyed but didn’t say anything other than okay.

So my bachelorette finally rolls around. My SIL is 6 months pregnant. I have another friend who is also 6 months pregnant who is coming on the bachelorette trip. I’m excited but I still definitely have a little disappointment in my heart that it wasn’t what I really wanted. One week out I texted her asking if she was ready to which she replied that she “doesn’t know” because her mental health isn’t feeling right. I told her it was really important for her to be there and that even if she could just come for one dinner instead of the whole weekend it would mean a lot. I even offered to have her husband join us so she wouldn’t have to do the drive alone and she would have a support system aside from me. She told me she’d think about it and let me know.

The day before my bachelorette I texted her again asked if she was coming. She said no. Well… I completely lost all patience. I don’t think I’ve ever been so upset and so angry as I was in that moment. I told her she was a terrible bridesmaid and SIL and that I was completely disgusted by her treatment of me after everything I have done to help her. I told her not to ask me for anything ever again because I am done being her doormat and letting her use me. I then proceeded to block her on social media, leave any group chats and tell her she was no longer in my wedding party. I honestly almost uninvited her to the wedding.

She then told my husband that I “needed to get my head out of my… mindset because SHE’S PREGNANT”. My husband told her off, which didn’t go over well and she said she’d never forgive us for how we treated her. Honestly the whole thing was a disaster but she really showed me her true colours.

Honestly I am a people pleaser and I was really upset with myself for changing my wedding vision and plans to accommodate her when she clearly didn’t care for me as much as I cared for her. My MIL even apologized for the behaviour of her daughter and told me I’d done nothing wrong and that everyone has a breaking point.

Anyway the wedding was amazing, she and her husband showed up which I was kind of surprised about and they were civil the whole night. The wedding was the second time we got to meet our nephew, which was nice but also awkward because I really was hopeful for a good relationship.

AITA for kicking her out of my wedding party? I have never been pregnant so I don’t know what it’s like, but I don’t think that it justifies treating people poorly. Thoughts??

Confirm them for days of the week…

Then nothing. Never activate. I know in the original synch there was a schedule on/off but I don’t see that on this machine or in the manual.

1pk4ph2,https://v.redd.it/zff8ht756m6g1,Beginner home barista dialing in help [CASABREWS CM5418 | Tuni G1 Conical Burr Grinder],"# For context here is what I'm working with at the moment:

* [Casabrews CM5418 Espresso Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Espresso-Professional-Removable-Cappuccino-Macchiato/dp/B09X3WGJ3R/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)
* [Tuni G1 Conical Burr Grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCVRX7ZX), grind setting 4
* [Ultrean Mini Coffee Scale with Timer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRNYQ78Z)
* [51mm Bottomless Portafilter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6SMCTL9)
* 15 grams of [local roasted coffee](https://www.pearlandcoffeeroasters.com/shop-1/p/palo-alto) roasted on November 25th
* [Distribution Tool ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCF9TR6K)
* [Self-leveling Tamp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCF9TR6K)
* RDT before grinding
* 1:2 ratio of 15g in and 30g out in 24-30 seconds

# My process is as follows:

Pre-warm machine and cup by doing single shot of just water, weigh out 15g of coffee, do RDT before grinding, grind at setting 4 on my grinder, place ground coffee into bottomless portafilter, use distribution tool, use self-leveling tamp, place cup on top of scale, press double shot button and start timer, and pull around 30-33g at around 24-30 seconds.

# My issue:

The double shot I'm pulling seems to blonde too early when starting the shot and tastes a bit sour, but not face scrunching sour. I've gotten to the point where I've hit my ideal time for the double shot of 28 seconds for 33g of coffee but I still have those two issues. Intuitively I think that rather than go finer than I already am, I would have to increase my dose which would result in me having to dial-in again which isn't a problem. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

1pk4pew,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pk4pew/im_the_bad_guy_after_all/,I'm the bad guy after all.,"Well, here's the story, I've known this girl since I was 14, and me I wasn't a girl guy, like I didn't talk to girls, I'm not gay, it's just felt disrespectful, anyway, my friend put me up with this girl, at first it was just a funny experience, never took it serious, it went for 2 years, and I had some type of depression or something I guess, anyway I literally just didn't want to talk at all, to anyone, I isolated myself completely, and well we broke up respectfully.

Anyway after one year, I had a girl in my class, and she knew that we were together, and she kept pushing me to contact my ex over and over, and guess what I did it one night after I drunk a lot of coffee, and it went well, and we went back together, but this time we were more mature and grown up, and this time it got serious, we basically spoke daily, like daily daily, a lot of late night calls and texting, and we never had an argument, we just were so synchronized, we had so much chemistry and understanding and respect. 

But after 3 years of her absolutely being my whole world and my only thought in my head, stress got me, I had a burnout, school, family, friends, health, everything all at once, and all I wanted is to not lose myself again and drown, so I basically just acted cool when we talked, but that was a bad idea, because I gave up and I just drowned again, and depression hit me again, and because I had anxiety and I overthink, I just was blaming her in my head somehow, and because of that, I started texting her dry texts, like I was punishing her for something she has nothing to do with, but she kept trying to help me, but I was so f blinded, and didn't see it, and at the end she just gave up on me, and when she did, just then I realized what I did, and tried to reverse it but it was so late, and out of frustration, my final text was ""you are the worst thing to ever happen in my life"", I apologized after and explained myself, but I never got a response, and from that day I never saw her again. 

I sound like a bad guy, and I can admit that, because I still punish myself everyday for whatever I may caused to her, and I'm still trying to heal and become a better person. I just wanted to share this story with u guys, so whoever has something to say, u are free.",1,1765477055.0,BreakUps,5,1.0,False
