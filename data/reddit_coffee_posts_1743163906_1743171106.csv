I randomly remembered this subreddit and decided to share it, I wrote it all in 11 days and didn't proof read it before posting LMAO sorry about that

The grey streets now coated by white snow mark the beginning of a new season. Structures adorned in red, flashing lights, pine trees covered in ornaments from head to toe decorated the city, same we've seen every year. It all clashed in contrast with the grumpy young man dressed in a black hoodie heading towards the mall, between glares of judgement and curiosity.
Behind the checkout counter was his fate, and there he went, wearing a white button-up and green apron, fully uniformed with a hat covering his shaved head but not the vacant expression on his face. The store was sparsely inhabited, it's Christmas afterall; most people were busy with more important things than home appliances.

It would have been the perfect day for a break, he thought, distracted from the tedious shift by watching happy families passing by the window shop. It was different from the other afternoons; today was special, not for him, but everyone else. It was the end of the year, and once again, the emptiness returned as though there were nothing between one holiday and the other.
Life had become a small, tight hole. Trapped in it, all that was left to do was watch the passage of stars and clouds above, unable to do anything. There were no future prospects; he was powerless, a spectator too small to escape that slit of darkness on earth. Flakes descending from the skies, ironically, fit into the breach, the thick whiteness burying his small feet.

His absorption in thought was interrupted by a large hand on his shoulder, weighing like guilt, and peering, he found himself face to face with an elderly man. — Quiet today, isn’t it? You must be mad at me, making you work on such special date. – It was his boss, dressed in a gray suit with the same festive hat.
Feigning casuality, he scoffed falsely. — Oh, no... Actually, I haven’t been thinking about it at all. – The icy touch of his skin penetrated the thin fabric between them. Boss was a tall man, with icy eyes and graying eyebrows.

— Don’t lie to me. – From the perspective of unsuspecting passersby, seemed like a friendly conversation, but between them, the threat thickened in the atmosphere. Like a snake, the man’s arm coiled around his neck, drawing him closer to the gleaming fangs displayed between the dry strands of white beard. — Suha, how old are you? –
– ...I’m twenty-five. – Downcast, Suha peered warily at the yellowed, shining teeth, glinting with the victorious sadism of an experienced hunter asserting control over its virgin prey, cautiously anticipating his next move.

— Twenty-five... But I don’t see a ring on your finger. It’s about time you get married and have children. – The snow had already reached knee-length, and he knew that with the next falling flake, he would be stuck, immobilized. Those words pierced through his brain, rooting themselves like pins so thin, reaching the imperceptible.
With the solitary life he led, he never thought about it; inside the hole, there’s no room for anyone else. His humble apartment had a single bedroom, and his routine was too busy. His reality made a family unfeasible. — I never thought about it... I think it’s too early to think about marriage; I don’t have anyone in mind. —

– Too early? – He laughed, mocking the naivety, and with a slap, grabbed the smaller man’s arm. — Your time will pass. – Purring, his fingers slid, descending slowly, creating folds down the sleeve. The movements were persistent and intimate, but authoritarian. – When the skin on your face starts to wrinkle, people won’t look at you the same way anymore... Not the same way I do. – Whispers that brushed against Suha’s ear caused him to break into a cold sweat. He shivered at the unsubtle gesture, the grip tightening as his discomfort grew.

— I have a gift for you. Meet me in the parking lot after your shift. — 

When imagining this situation, he thought he would handle it differently, that the layer covering him up to his neck would melt away so he could swim out, but standing there, dumbstruck like a statue, did nothing. The man turned and left, Suha sighed, not realizing he's been holding his breath.
It was true that refusing the invitation was handing a resignation letter, and at the moment, he depended on that job to support himself. He felt chained to the man, and the rest of the day was filled with anguish and anxiety, counting down time until he would leave the mall and see him again. Every minute forced his gaze to dart back to the clock. In maddening silence, he begged for it to stop, a false hope that, by miracle, the numbers would remain the same forever. He didn’t understand his excessive fear; he didn’t think, but if possible, he would question why.

The setting sun in the parking lot warmed his body, now covered by the thick, black hoodie he felt a sense of security. However, in the face of the promise's ghost, felt exposed. As he walked, he saw the dark figure stand out against the sunset. It was a crimson shadow strategically placed behind the car, the silhouette overshadowed by the sunlight sinking on the horizon behind it.
A few feet away, his feet froze, feeling the gaze creeping all over himself. — You’re tense. – Behind the beard, lips curved into a malicious smile. — Don’t be afraid, you’ll like it. – He pulled the key from his pocket and opened the trunk. He raised the hatch to reveal a husky puppy, wrapped in red cloth. In his hands he was tiny, quiet as a stuffed animal. Without further wait, the man shoved the dog into the young man’s bust, who reflexively caught it.

— Merry Christmas! —

Between the embrace, they exchanged glances. It was sudden, but swift, the situation filled him with doubt. Hesitating, he never having considered adoption, nor did he have any affinity for animals. With a dog, mornings dedicated to a warm cup of coffee would become mandatory daily walks; the extra money he saved for sweets and treats would now go toward an additional, demanding responsibility, one he had never planned for.
These were luxuries he enjoyed, a decision he had made for himself. — I don’t know... My apartment doesn’t allow pets. — From every angle it seemed like an ambush. The desperation in Suha’s eyes wiped the friendly expression from the elderly man’s face, morphing into disapproval. The mask fell away, hardening.

— You don’t like it? — The threat of conflict emerged in the spat out words, his face frowning slowly. – N-No, that’s not it! It’s just that... I didn’t expect it! – Stammering, he apologized. — I’ve never had a dog. I’m not sure I’m ready... – The sincerity in his scared tone was enough to entertain his boss, who laughed, mocking the revelation.
— Pfft, you’re twenty-five and never had a dog? Do you think I’m stupid? – Boldly, he poked the younger man’s bust. – Normal people like dogs. You should be happy, someone thought of the useless, lonely boy with something besides disdain and anger. — The voice hardened, but not the benevolent expression.

— Don’t be so selfish, this puppy needs a home. Are you going to deny a gift from God? — 

He shook his head just to see the authoritative smile return, just to leave without objection. As he did, Suha noticed the rapid palpitations in his chest and suddenly became aware of sweat beads dripping down his face. ""It’s not his fault,"" he told himself as he exchanged glances with the dog’s bluish eyes, ""I can’t be angry with him.""
Night fell down the path; just after the rush hour, roads were busy. Surrounded, Suha kept his head narrow, avoiding faces and stumbling between restless feet on the sidewalks. He didn’t think about the way through, nor did he realize when he arrived at his building. Doorman didn’t raise any suspicions, and the dog remained silent.

What a strange puppy, hadn’t made a sound since they met; it was almost as though he wasn’t there. But within the familiar floor of his home, there was a reminder, a stain of tension he had just dismissed in the form of a small, so innocent canine. No matter how negative it seemed, he was as tied to Suha as he was to him. — Are you hungry? — The dog tilted his head, stealing a weak grin from him.
A pile of dishes awaited in the kitchen, leftovers of noon. The hissing waters flowing over porcelain was muffled by the echo of a question in his mind, unanswered. Why me? Moments ago, everything felt like a distant, bad dream, sillence fell over the world, leaving a torturous dull. Watching the foam dissipate, he felt the drum of his heart overpowering the quiet. Fast, aggressive beats begged him to release tangled feelings in his throat, but it was the last fork before confronting it again, so he finished the task and put raw meat in a dry bowl for the dog.

Leaving the bowl near the ruby blanket, he turned and ordered coldly. — Eat. — The dog’s presence disgusted him. He locked himself in the bedroom, seeking the sense of security lost between clean pajamas and thick blankets, with the windows shut. When finally exhausted from tossing and turning, his eyelids grew heavy, falling into a slumber. 
With eyes shut, he saw endless darkness. A vast field, where it was impossible to determine where it began or ended, all there was were sprigs of touch-me-nots scattered across the ground, their leaves exposed and open. It was such an ordinary, quiet place that vulnerability wasnt fearsome.

Just suddenly, the peace was broken by the sound of cracking bones. Hands descending from the heavens with interlaced, tangled fingers, moved frantically while arranged to form a large grinning face, agonizing as they approached the ground.
Upon contact with the plants, the extremities of each branch met and closed, a chain reaction. Relentless, the movements continued, and dissatisfied, digging with nails, pulling at the roots. The figure's hands mimic smiling, penetrating the earth with all his limbs until submerged into the soil, leaving an eternal hole with his silhouette.",1,1743170878.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

First time posting here, long time lurker. Lol 
For context, I’m 37, he’s 33. We met on hinge in January. We had our first date at the beginning of February and have been inseparable since. We’ve going on serious dates and having very casual hangs. It all feels so natural and like the easiest thing in the world. Nothing feels forced and in some strange way, it’s like we’ve known each other forever. 

The other day we were having coffee and the sun just hit his face right in all the right ways and I thought to myself, “damn. I think I love this man.” For some reason, I didn’t say it in the moment. Part of my brain is telling me that it’s too soon and if I say it, it will mess things up and the other half is saying, say it! 

For those of you in relationships, when did you tell your significant other that you loved them? How long into dating them did you say it? What was their reaction?

I don’t want to let me past shitty relationships junk and insecurities get in the way of me expressing how I feel. 

Any advice is appreciated!

Thanks everyone!

1jlvvyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/onexindia/comments/1jlvvyf/mate_selection_part_ii/,Mate selection Part II,"Mate Selection Part II - How to properly vet a woman for relationship

By popular request on my thoughts, in my DMs - here is a continuation of my philosophy.

——

More men should properly vet their women.

Here’s the reality: society has four kinds of players—P!mps, main girls, h0es, and tr!cks. The reason most men end up miserable is that they act like tr!cks when dealing with women, rushing into relationships just because she’s hot. They ignore red flags and let superficial attraction blind them, ending up with headaches and drama.

In dating, a P!mp is a man who knows exactly how to vet his woman. His main girl is the one who’s earned her spot through tests and proven usefulness.

H0es are the women who pretend purity, using charm to lock you in but hiding their messy past and true intentions. Tr!cks are average guys who take these women seriously without proper vetting—getting disrespected, cheated on, and drained financially and emotionally. Many women mock men as inc3ls, but the truth is, most of these women are relationship-c3ls—single because they can’t qualify for the high-value men they truly want.

If you’re aiming to become a P!mp, understand this clearly:
	1.	Time: You never know a woman fully until at least 6-12 months. Initially, every girl sells purity. Give her time—her real self always comes out.
	2.	Utility: Your girl must add value to your life. Give her tasks—coffee runs, emails, errands. Make her work. She must see you as the boss, never an equal. Ever seen women disrespecting men openly? That guy failed this test.
	3.	Reputation: A girl’s past is your future. Will Smith built an incredible career but chose the wrong woman. Now he’s remembered for a wife who embarrassed him. Always dig deep. Use social media, friends, clubs, and online background checks (yes, sites exist to uncover her hidden OnlyF@ns or esc0rt past). Protect your legacy.
	4.	Test: Always match what a woman says to what she does. If she says, “I don’t party,” but she’s in clubs every weekend—wake the hell up. That’s a lie. Test her continuously.
	5.	Follow Your Lead: This isn’t a democracy. Your woman must follow your commands without hesitation. If she questions your authority, she doesn’t respect you. Dump her. You must always hold absolute frame.

But here’s the harshest truth—most men don’t even deserve to lead. You complain about disrespectful women, yet you’re broke, fat, lazy, and live with your parents. Why should any woman respect you? Respect is earned, never given. Be worthy of respect first.

It’s simple: Stop behaving like tr!cks, start vetting like P!mps. If you don’t, prepare to spend your life in endless frustration, playing the fool in relationships. Do the work, earn the right to demand respect, and only then properly vet and choose your woman.",1,1743170804.0,onexindia,2,1.0,False

1jlvumf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlvumf/emergency_alert_code_crimson/,Emergency Alert : CODE CRIMSON,"It was a Tuesday—dull, routine, a day for stale coffee and endless data. I never thought the world would end on a Tuesday. My plan was simple: slog through my government research job, then hit O’Malley’s for a whiskey and some grumbling about red tape. Now, I stand atop a shattered ruin, blood dripping from talons that were once hands, the city a smoldering grave below. My name’s Adrian Carter, and I was human—until I became something more, something they never meant to unleash.

It hit at 3 p.m. I was at my desk, poring over cellular regeneration stats, when the sirens screamed—a piercing howl that shredded the office drone. The intercom crackled: *""CODE CRIMSON. Lockdown procedures initiated. All personnel remain in designated secure areas. This is not a drill.""*

Code Crimson. Biological containment failure, the kind we’d laughed off in briefings. My gut twisted. The room exploded—chairs crashing, voices shrieking. I grabbed my backpack, shoving my laptop inside, and froze as a memory struck: Sarah at breakfast, her blonde hair glowing in the sun, Tommy giggling as he smeared jam on his cheeks. “Don’t work too late,” she’d said, kissing me. “Tommy’s got soccer tomorrow.” I’d promised I’d be there. Now, the sirens drowned that vow, and dread clawed me—not just for the lab, but for them.

I bolted, sneakers squeaking on tile. Lights flickered, a coppery stench choking the air. I rounded a corner and stopped cold. Dr. Patel was sprawled, throat a gaping red maw, blood pooling. Above him loomed an infected—twitching, fast, eyes glowing crimson, talons black and slick. It grinned, predatory, chilling.

“Carter, run!” a guard yelled, firing. The shot punched its chest, dark blood spraying, but it lunged, claws slashing his gut. Intestines spilled like wet ropes, and Patel’s gurgles faded as I stumbled back, bile burning my throat.

I ran—alarms turning to static, lights dying, snarls closing in. I swiped my ID at Lab Sector 5, the door hissing open. I threw myself in, slamming it as talons raked the glass, leaving bloody streaks. Dr. Emily Novak and Jacobs, a security grunt, stared—Emily trembling, her lab coat splattered red, Jacobs pale, pistol unsteady.

“We’re trapped,” Emily whispered, voice cracking. “They locked it all down.”

“There’s a way,” I said, panic surging. “There has to be.”

“You didn’t hear the last call,” Jacobs growled. “It’s not just here—it’s the city. Everywhere.”

The words hit like a brick. I sank down, yanking my laptop open. Servers flickered, but I pulled *Crimson Genesis*: bio-enhancement for super soldiers—reflexes, healing. The serum had mutated, twisting subjects into feral nightmares.

A growl rumbled outside. Lights went black.

“Behind me!” Jacobs hissed, aiming. The glass shattered, three infected bursting in—claws flashing, eyes blazing. Jacobs fired, bullets tearing flesh, brains splattering, but two tackled him. Talons ripped his chest, ribs snapping, blood gushing as he screamed—cut short by a wet crunch.

“Adrian!” Emily dragged me to a vent. “Move!”

I kicked the grate free, shoved her in, and crawled after, claws scraping metal behind us. We spilled into a maintenance shaft, dust thick, the asylum’s rotten pulse faint in the walls. I slumped against the vent wall, chest heaving, the laptop’s glow casting shadows on my hands. Emily’s breaths rasped beside me, her bloodied coat a grim flag. My mind raced—Patel’s shredded throat, the guard’s guts, those crimson eyes locked on me with that sick grin. They weren’t mindless. They were fast, relentless, shrugging off bullets like nothing.

I fumbled the laptop open, fingers shaking as I scanned *Crimson Genesis* again. The screen flickered, but the words burned: *Enhanced reflexes. Accelerated healing. Heightened aggression.* My breath caught. Patel’s killer had moved like a blur—too fast for the guard. The lab attackers took hits, blood spraying, yet kept coming, talons slashing. This wasn’t random chaos. This was the serum—our serum—twisted into something grotesque. My work on regeneration, those sleepless nights, fed into this. We’d aimed to craft soldiers—perfect, unstoppable humans. Not these… things.

A cold sweat prickled my neck. They weren’t mistakes. They were the goal, warped beyond reason—humanity’s potential, turned inside out.

“What the hell are they?” Emily whispered, her voice trembling, eyes wide with terror.

I stared at my hands, the laptop’s light glinting off them, and felt a hollow ache spread through me. “They’re us,” I said, my voice flat, empty, like it belonged to someone else. “What we were supposed to be.”

Emily’s eyes darted to me, confusion mixing with fear. “What do you mean, us?”

I didn’t answer—couldn’t. The asylum’s pulse grew louder, a wet thudding in my ears. My hands twitched, a sharp pain lancing up my spine. Something shifted inside me, and I didn’t know if I could fight it.

We emerged in Black Hollow Asylum—walls pulsing like flesh, oozing bile, air thick with rot. Silence pressed, then screams pierced it. Dr. Whitmore staggered forward, throat torn, eyes wild. “Adrian…” His grin stretched, veins snapping, and a black mass erupted—guts spilling like wriggling snakes, splashing the floor.

I screamed, stumbling as my hands twitched. Nails darkened into talons, pain searing my spine. A voice roared: *“FEED.”*

“No!” I clawed my skull, but my talons sank into Whitmore’s corpse, flesh parting like wet cloth. He dissolved, power surging—sick, wrong, alive.

“Adrian, what’s happening?” Emily backed away, trembling.

“I don’t know!” I shouted, voice breaking. “I can’t stop it!”

The asylum quaked, walls splitting, spilling viscera. Abominations emerged—faceless, bones piercing skin, jaws unhinging with jagged teeth. One lunged, saliva dripping; I slashed—talons tore its throat, black blood spraying, body crumbling. Another charged—I grabbed its head, crushing it, skull popping, gore coating my arms.

A silhouette loomed—limbs shifting, eyes leaking ichor. “You let me out,” it gurgled.

“What are you?” I yelled.

“What you become,” it laughed, wet and deep.

Walls wailed, doors burst, monsters swarmed. I fought—ruthless. One bit my arm; I ripped its jaw off, bone splintering, blood arcing. Another leapt—I drove my talons through its chest, heart bursting, warm and slick.

Soldiers stormed in—hazmat suits, flamethrowers roaring. I moved like a phantom. One swung a rifle; I snapped his arm, bone piercing skin, then tore his throat, blood fountaining. Another fired—bullets ripped my side, but I healed, lunging to smash his helmet, skull caving, brains painting the wall.

I climbed a ruin, the Zone a graveyard, flames licking the dark. The infected followed, a horde at my feet. A radio crackled: *“Phase One complete. Containment zones activated globally. Crimson Genesis deployment successful—85% infection rate. Proceed to Phase Two: activation of the Catalysts.”*

Another voice: *“Zone 17 Catalyst uncontained. Subject Carter’s mutation deviates—monitor closely.”*

Not their chosen one—an accident. My laptop confirmed: *“Controlled infection for population reduction. Catalysts to initiate secondary evolution. The Old Bloodlines will rise anew.”* Old Bloodlines—a ritualistic whisper, a hint of ancient power tied to blood, not just control. They’d meant to anoint specific Catalysts, not me—a rogue, an anomaly they couldn’t leash.

“Serve,” the voice hissed.

“No,” I snarled, tearing my chest, ichor spilling then recoiling. I wasn’t theirs—I’d be their end.

The highest ruin became my throne, my coat a tattered cape, skin pale as marble, eyes ember-bright, fangs gleaming. The infected knelt, chanting. A flashback hit: Sarah and Tommy at the park, her smile warm, his laughter bright as he kicked a ball. “You’re my hero, Dad,” he’d said. Now they were gone—lost to the crimson tide—and I was no hero, but a king of shadows.

“You wanted a reset,” I said, voice a blade. “I’ll give you ruin.”

I’d hunt their zones—New York, Tokyo—ripping through their labs, their soldiers. A soldier charged below; I leapt, talons slashing his spine free, vertebrae scattering, blood soaking me. Another fired—I tore his arm off, flesh shredding, then sank fangs into his neck, hot blood flooding my mouth.

The Council—marked by a triangle with three eyes on a corpse’s gear—would bleed. I’d find them, those shadows of the Old Bloodlines, and end their ritual. Their world would fall, and I’d forge a kingdom of the damned—a new dawn of gore and shadow.

As a founder, you're always eager to launch, but the reality is that the road to a successful product is long and winding.

I recall struggling to prioritize features, worrying about market validation, and debating the ideal balance between quality and timeliness. We scrapped countless iterations, adjusted our strategy, and re-evaluated our resources. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, but it taught us invaluable lessons.

Our MVP development process was iterative, with frequent testing and refinement. We focused on building a minimal, yet functional product that addressed the core pain points of our target audience. We validated the market through customer feedback, surveys, and early adopter networks.

Key takeaways from our journey:

* Keep it simple, stupid (KISS) – Don't overcomplicate your MVP with too many features or untested hypothesis.
* Validate early and often – Test your assumptions with real users and iterate accordingly.
* Resourcefulness is key – Be prepared to pivot, adjust, and reprioritize based on new information.
* Stay flexible – Be open to new ideas, and don't be afraid to rework or abandon something that's not working.
* Focus on quality – A well-designed, user-friendly MVP will earn you credibility and set the stage for future success.

Remember, your MVP is not a fixed entity, but a stepping stone towards a better product. Embrace the uncertainty, stay curious, and be prepared to adapt. With persistence, bravery, and a willingness to learn, you'll be well on your way to building a successful startup.",1,1743170617.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

I recently got Kedaram and Kilpauk Standard from Kapi Kottai, but I'm having a hard time dialing in a pour-over with Kedaram. The pack mentions notes of chocolate, berries, and coconut water, but I just don't seem to be getting coconut water at all. This has a medium-light roast profile, and I've tried brewing it both as a medium and a light roast. The tasting notes seem to be much more open when I brew it like a medium roast (coarser grind, cooler water temperature).

A bit about how I brewed this: 

1. I've rested these for around 2 weeks, as I got a very acidic brew at around 1 week. 
2. I use a ratio of 15g beans to 250ml water
3. Going by Tetsu's method, I used a 50:50 division for the 40% and the 60% (so two 50ml pours, two 75ml pours) to get a balanced brew

While the brew I got is pleasant, with ample sweetness and a gentle berry-like acidity, I really got these beans for the coconut water notes. 

How has your experience been with this coffee? How do I better dial this coffee?

I’m hoping for a vibe that isn’t solely booze focused but do enjoy a nice bars/restaurant. We did pottery painting last time we saw each other and it was a lovely activity but I’d like to do something a bit different.

Planning a trip with my SO to go to Spain in the first two weeks of September. We’ve been to Mediterannean countries such as Italy and Greece. 
We don’t like to party. We love good and authentic food, coffee as well as nice beaches where we can relax.

This is the itineray we’ve planned so far. We’d appreciate any comments or recommendations for neighbourhoods to stay in.

Arrive in Malaga from TO and spend 4 nights (day trips to Sevilla and Marbella)

Drive to Nerja and spend 3 nights with day trip to Granada included

Drive back to Malaga and take a flight to Marbella and spend 5 nights

Fly to Barcelona and spend 2 nights

Depart for home

I am incredibly careful but for the last six months get Dunkin coffee usually about once a week (mainly for their extra point deals). Except for a handful of shaken espressos, I have always gotten just iced coffee or cold brew which comes out of a tap with a syrup or swirl, then almond or skim milk. I only started this per a Celiac dietitian talking about how all of the drinks (minus a blended beverage or the toppings, the oat milk is gluten free but not Celiac safe) do not contain gluten. Therefore, CC within just the drinks themselves was very low. I swear I must have read something about how they could be safe for us, obviously not 100% but not the worst even though they sell gluten. 

I do not usually have outright symptoms, I haven’t felt any different, my usual locations have the coffee area all in one spot (not where they make the sandwiches) but now I am wondering how stupid I’ve been getting coffee there. It seems the Celiac community is very split on Dunkin, I felt like it was better than Starbucks given at least the drinks had less gluten inherently in them.

Has anyone been ok with Dunkin or done something where they may have risked CC for a while without realizing it? As someone who hardly eats out, researches everything I eat, I feel incredibly stupid and panicked that almost seven years in I didn’t analyze this sooner.",1,1743170308.0,Celiac,1,1.0,False

I've been through the every part of academic life for the past 4 years, and if I could go back and tell my younger self something, it would be this: breathe, relax, and stop trying to be perfect.

Your mental health matters more than any grade. I learned this the hard way after burning myself out multiple times, thinking that pulling all-nighters and living off energy drinks was some badge of honor. And, well, it's not. Take care of yourself first. Sleep is not for the weak - it's for the smart. Those extra hours of rest will do more for your learning and performance than another caffeine-fueled study marathon. ( i still drink coffee, but less :D )

Networking is everything, but not in the way you think. It's not about collecting business cards or fake LinkedIn connections. It's about genuine relationships. Talk to your professors, not just during exam season. Ask them about their experiences, their research. Connect with classmates who challenge your thinking. The people you meet will often be more important than the grades you get.

Don't be afraid to change direction. Your first major isn't your life sentence. I've seen so many people stick to a path they hate because they're scared of looking like they've ""failed"". Switching majors, taking a semester off, exploring different classes - these aren't failures. They're you figuring out what truly lights you up.

Learn practical skills outside your curriculum. Your degree is important, but in today's world, that piece of paper isn't enough. Learn to code, even if you're a humanities major. Pick up basic design skills. Start a side project. Build something, anything. The world rewards creators and problem solvers, not just degree holders.

Internships and real-world experience trump theoretical knowledge. Don't wait until your final year to start thinking about work experience. Start early, be proactive. Those three-month internships? They're worth more than a semester of theoretical learning. Make connections, ask questions, be curious.

Money management is a skill they don't teach you in class. Start understanding budgeting now. Learn to cook instead of ordering takeout every night. Look for student discounts. Start a small emergency fund. Future you will be so grateful.

Lastly, enjoy the ride. University is this unique bubble where you're simultaneously learning, growing, failing, and succeeding. Not everything will make sense right now, and that's okay. Be kind to yourself. Celebrate small wins. Don't compare your journey to anyone else's.

You've got this. Trust me.",1,1743169825.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

I have always been of the impression that water, black coffee, and plain tea were fine for a ketogenic diet.

We met at a  camp around a year ago and we just clicked. He is also really stubborn and even tho he's 20 in college he's never had a job and has no intention of getting one because his parents give him money. He has told me many times before how terrible his parents, he says they're very manipulating and has a constant handle on his life and doesn't let him do his own thing. I've tried to explain to him that maybe it's because he's 20 and doesn't even have a job and that because his parents give him money they have an entitlement to tell him what to do.

We were also both raised in Christian households but he's drifting further and further away from everything including his own church. He claims everyone there is just fake and they pretend to care and that they're all hypocrites and only wanna feel better about themselves for trying to engage in his life. The people his church are genuinely lovely people and I know that every Christian is only trying to make sure you only grow your love with God more not push it away and in the church we all care for one another. People from his church have talked to him before about what life is like as a Christian just being friendly by trying to meet up with him for a coffee or something but I swear everytime someone tries to give him life advice he sees it as a personal attack.

He's also never been in a relationship but is so desperate to get in one. So desperate that a few months ago he met this girl through his friends in college and he thought she was cute and was chatting to her. He found out a few hours later that she was actually previously a dude. When he explained that to me my jaw literally dropped and he still wanted to date her. I'm not one to judge people at all so I did support him but then he literally asked her out after 2 days of knowing her which is extremely quick. She said she'd think about it but then he found out from her friends that she didn't like him at all and she was just playing him. This like really broke him but I helped him get through it.

Anyways about a month ago she came up to him in college and apologised for her behaviour and asked could they be friends. He forgave her and agreed to be friends. Literally after maybe 2 days of being friends with her he started going on to me about how pretty she was and he was thinking that they actually will date. I tried to explain to him that just not to set any expectations again or get too attached and that it's okay just to be friends if that's what she really wants but he didn't listen. They started hanging out more and more and whenever I hung out with him it was all he would talk about. Now I'm grand with him expressing his feelings cuz that's what im here for but he made it sound so depressing but that's why he liked her so much apparently.

He said that he blocked her and he just said she's over and that she's not gonna let her have affect him anymore cuz she ain't worth it which I agreed.

Today he text me saying that he's gonna talk to her and give her a chance to redeem herself next week. Personally I don't think it's a good idea at all and i think she's gonna talk to him he's gonna forgive her and then she's gonna manipulate him again. I tried to tell him that she's not worth it and that she's already hurt him more than once but he isn't listening again. His mental health is not very good after all everything but he claims that it's not because of her and it's his parents and he has talked to me about being suicidal before so I really don't know what to do considering he won't listen to me but I know this could possibly be his last straw and I wanna do the best i can to help him",1,1743169664.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The Beverly Hillbillies and Biblical Wisdom: Discovering Faith Through Simple Living
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the rolling hills of the Ozarks lived the Clampett family, whose lives turned upside down when they struck oil and moved to the extravagant world of Beverly Hills. This beloved American sitcom, “The Beverly Hillbillies,” captivated audiences with its humorous portrayal of culture shock and enduring simplicity amidst wealth. But what if these themes also offered valuable biblical insights? Let’s explore how the light-hearted antics of Jed, Granny, Elly May, and Jethro can remind us of timeless truths found in Scripture.

From Rags to Riches: A Lesson in Contentment
--------------------------------------------

The story of the Clampetts, suddenly finding themselves millionaires, parallels the biblical principle of contentment. Despite their newfound wealth, the family’s fundamental values remained unchanged. As Jed famously stated, “The simple life is the life for me.”

- **1 Timothy 6:6-8 (NIV)** reminds us, “But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.”

The Clampetts’ joy wasn’t tied to their riches, but rather to their love for each other and the simplicity of rural life. This same spirit is reflected in Paul’s teachings on contentment.

How can we learn to find contentment in our daily lives, regardless of our circumstances? Take a moment to reflect on the things you’re grateful for today, writing them down as a reminder of where true contentment resides.

Hospitality and Generosity: The Clampetts’ Open Heart
-----------------------------------------------------

Jed, Granny, and the rest of the family frequently demonstrated an open-handed hospitality, sharing what they had with neighbors and strangers alike. Though their ways sometimes appeared old-fashioned, their hearts were always in the right place.

- The Bible speaks to this, as seen in **Hebrews 13:2 (NIV):** “Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.”

In what ways can you show hospitality and generosity in your own life? Consider inviting someone over for coffee or volunteering your time to help someone in need.

Reflect on how the simple act of kindness and generosity can be a powerful testimony of faith in action.

The Power of Humility: Walking in Faith Like Jed
------------------------------------------------

Despite his immense wealth, Jed Clampett never saw himself above others. He continued to approach life with humility—a trait the Bible holds in great esteem.

- **James 4:6 (NIV)** reminds us, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”

Jed’s humility and straightforward approach to life allowed him to remain grounded and approachable. His simplicity serves as a reminder of Jesus’ teachings that true greatness is found in humility and service to others.

Take a moment to consider your own life. Are there areas where pride may have crept in? How could adopting a humble heart bring renewal to your relationships and faith walk?

Family Unity: The Heart of the Clampetts
----------------------------------------

The family unit is central to the Clampetts, providing strength and support amidst the unfamiliarity of their new surroundings. The Bible also emphasizes the importance of family unity and love.

- **Colossians 3:13-14 (NIV)** states, “Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.”

How can you promote unity in your family or community? Whether it’s resolving conflicts with grace or finding ways to express love more clearly, intentional action contributes to stronger bonds.

Challenge yourself to perform an act of love or reconciliation within your family this week, and observe how it impacts the dynamic of your relationships.

A Call to Reflect and Act
-------------------------

“The Beverly Hillbillies,” with its emphasis on simplicity, hospitality, humility, and family, offers meaningful lessons that align beautifully with biblical teachings.

As you ponder these themes, consider how you might incorporate them more fully into your life. Share your insights or personal stories in the comments below—we’d love to hear how these principles have inspired change in your life.

Let’s engage in conversations that enrich our faith journeys, reminding ourselves that sometimes the answers lie in embracing simplicity, loving others generously, and trusting God with humility and gratitude.

By connecting our faith with everyday stories, we discover the extraordinary in the ordinary. May you find encouragement and inspiration from the Clampetts’ story as you walk your path of faith.

 Because we think in Goals and they are quantum and can be put in sets. Like a desire to  “Drink coffee”  - means anywhere, anytime, by anyone.","If you want coffee and you got it – you did same goal type many will do/did before. But let's start from the quantum bits, from the beginning!

 On the lowest scale of reality, on a computational level, quantum minimal bits possess only one purpose and characteristic—to be different from each other as a distinct sign, like 1, 2, 3.

In modern physics, fields are often used to describe the fundamental constituents of the universe. These fields can be seen as continuous and interconnected, but particles within these fields are distinct entities. Quantum fields are mathematical constructs that pervade all of spacetime. They differ from classical fields, such as electric or gravitational fields, as they represent a quantum mechanical description of particles and their properties. Each type of particle in the Standard Model of particle physics has an associated quantum field.

https://preview.redd.it/n7p5eavdofre1.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=43815b1fe808b1316fca4531a679c065d547d6bd

The Standard Model includes several types of quantum fields, each corresponding to a specific particle type.

   \- Electron Field: Associated with electrons and other charged leptons.

   \- Photon Field: Associated with photons, the particles of light.

   \- Gluon Field: Associated with gluons, which mediate the strong nuclear force.

   \- W and Z Boson Fields: Associated with the W and Z bosons, responsible for weak nuclear interactions.

   \- Higgs Field: Associated with the Higgs boson, responsible for giving mass to particles. 

Ok there are fields, but is there true vacuum? Is there a computational vacuum when some 3D space doesn’t have any meanings inside? The quantum vacuum, often referred to as the ""vacuum state,"" is not truly empty but is instead a complex and dynamic medium filled with fluctuations in various quantum fields, even in the absence of particles. These fluctuations can give rise to the appearance of particle-antiparticle pairs for very short periods. What matters in this computational universe, is that  some “events” happen in vacuum. Events are a qubits of stories. And stories become real when observed. Some interdimensional dramaturgy that penetrates our reality but leaves nothing after it annihilates in a form of particle-antiparticle.

https://preview.redd.it/h9130bniofre1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9920a33eb57d2db1c975ab74ef4afc28a5156ed

In quantum field theory, fields are considered continuous and are defined at every point in spacetime. There isn't a concept of a smallest ""scale"" in the sense of discrete particles or grains. Quantum fields exist and fluctuate continuously throughout spacetime, obeying the principles of quantum mechanics. 

But! While fields are continuous, the quantization of these fields occurs when particles, or excitations, arise within them. These particles are often viewed as localized disturbances or vibrations in the field, with their energy corresponding to the mass and other properties of the particle. That is when you observe personally those fields and they create a personal story in your brain, that tells you everything is “real”. Things become certain when you notice them and involve into your story. Things you don’t know – don’t exist until you are affected by them or until you notice them.

The world appears continuous, but the only information we can extract from it is quantum.

Quantum Fields seem to create the most interesting and unprecedented events in space-time, all presented in the form of a ""story"" with a character-way-goal mechanism encapsulated in everything around us. These fields give rise to entities, heroes of stories, such as atoms, molecules, birds, or trains, all part of a joined set and forming categories like ""trains"" or ""birds."" So there are “birds” of the future and the past in an imaginary list of such category. And all “trains” all “sitting near the table” all “drinking the coffee” and “I want a good job” stories of the world can also be put in a categorized list. All that are goals set by people in different places and time, but they all did and will do those same things. In fact that is only ONE shared meaning spread through all space and all time. Truly higher dimensional stuff. “Drink coffee”  - means anywhere, anytime.

If this approach fascinates you, check out basics of Computational Dramaturgy (modern branch of process philosophy) on SSRN, where deeper narratives are explored in the way they govern reality itself. It means Reality is a set of processes. Personality and souls are a sets of processes too. They are computational and fundamental:

If things go really well, you’ll be stuck with a clingy-ass gremlin for the rest of your life. Are you up for the challenge? 🤨

For starters, let’s come up with a plan on how to execute this. Are you somewhat of a homebody like me? Maybe we could go out and explore cafés together! Cafés give off cozy vibes, just like home does, so it’s almost the same thing! Heads up though, I don’t drink coffee. However, I do enjoy sweet drinks, especially matcha. Yeah, I’m one of those grass enjoyers 🤪. Hmm, cafés not your cup of tea? Okay then, do you enjoy video games? If you do, how about showing me your skills at an arcade? Just a warning, I won’t back down! (even though I actually suck at games, bc I don’t “play” games with people). Not into games either? Are you a fan of films, series, or binge-watching TV shows? Because I am! We could go to one of those movie theaters with comfy seats! I may not be the type to talk a lot during a movie, but trust me, my exaggerated reactions will make up for it 😆.

Or are you the type who loves being out in the sun? You know, I went on my first ever hiking trip recently, I enjoyed it although I pretty much exhausted myself down to the core 😆. How about we check out some mountains and reach their peaks together? Not into that kind of outdoor adventure? Okay, how about a park day instead? We could people-watch and talk about anything that comes to mind. Then, when the sun sets, we can take a stroll together, just enjoying the quiet and each other’s company. Is that too chill for you? Maybe you’re more of a music person! We could go to concerts or gigs and support indie bands and artists! 

Ah, I got so caught up in planning that I forgot to introduce myself :D. I’m a petite (5’0 feet tall 😭) glasses-wearing morena with a normal BMI, currently finishing up my studies in a health-allied program. I can be busy at times but I will make time for you. No matter how mundane my day is, you can expect me to tell you all about it. At first, I might come off a little formal, kind of like your manager on your first day at work, but don’t worry! You just have to complete a few side quests to unlock my yapper side (kidding). Despite the very extroverted intro, I have an introverted soul. It takes me time to open up to people, which is why I enjoy slow-burn with an intention, of course. As for my preferences, I’m drawn to someone who is kind, quick-witted (slow ako maka-gets ng joke minsan huhu), smart (hehe), emotionally mature and a licensed professional. I like a man who is introverted but at the same time, can be extroverted if given the chance. Bonus points if he takes the lead, shows initiative, knows what he wants in life, takes care of himself, values hygiene, and most importantly, can make me laugh! Extra brownie points for that! I forgot to include but-1/+2 in age please huhu.

I think that’s about it! Can you tell me one fun fact about yourself if you’ve reached this far? I put effort into my intro so I hope you’ll do the same thing 🥹.

I haven't told anyone about this. I (25M) went on a break with my girlfriend ""Claire"" (26F) last month. We have an agreement where of we're not seeing each other, temporary or otherwise, we can hook up with other people as long as we get tested when we get back together. We've gone on breaks before, as we've been together for 5 years and get in dumb arguments a lot.

This last argument was because I have a trans woman friend and Claire is transphobic and homophobic. She wanted me to cut this friend out of my life for no reason other than she ""doesn't feel safe around [her]"" which is total bs. They've only met once, I was there the whole time, and my friend said and did nothing weird. So we went on a break.

The thing is, she doesn't know this, but I'm pretty bi-curious. I've always found men attractive and have been interested in playing for a different team, just to try it. I am active in online queer spaces but I'm completely closeted irl. So last week I went to a gay bar in my town on singles' night to see what it was like.

I'm pretty masculine so I got hit on a few times, but I actually struck up a conversation with this really gorgeous guy (""Chase,"" 23FtM) who was just my type. He bought me a drink and we chatted for a long time, during which he told me that he was trans and actually knew my friend, as they had dated before either of them transitioned and actually cracked each other's egg, lol. Apparently they're still friends.

We kept drinking and getting handsier and flirting harder until he asked if I wanted to go back to his place. I agreed, eagerly, and we caught an Uber and I kinda had the best sex of my life. He was super sweet and gentle and made sure everything was perfect. I ended up sleeping over and in the morning he even made me pancakes and coffee, and they might have been even better than the sex. I left with his number and the promise of seeing him again.

Yesterday Claire texted me and said that she hasn't changed her mind about my friend, but she says I can still talk to her and we can just agree to disagree. After how shitty she was I don't really want to, and I'm leaning towards leaving her and maybe starting something with Chase? During our chat he said he was fine with hookups but was looking for something a little more long term. I used to love my girlfriend but I'm not sure I do anymore. She's paranoid.

Please ask me anything you want to know about me and I'll happily answer. I'll probably do the same as I want to get to know you better. We don't necessarily have to share the same hobbies, sure it helps to bond but I like to learn about your hobbies, especially when I don't know much about them.

I'm willing to share photos of myself after a few days if we get along and feel comfortable with you. But roughly to say, I'm tall, slim, have dark short hair, blue eyes.

I'm looking forward hearing from you.

I’m looking for ideas on what we can do.

Here are some options I’ve come up with so far…
-CN tower 
-St Lawrence Market
-Exploring the Path
-Kensington/China Town
-Public transit (GO, trolly, subway)
-Toronto birthday celebration (Nathan Phillips Square Saturday night)
-Queen street

Granted, the weather and time will be an important factor in figuring out what to do.  Due to time constraints, ROM and Casa Loma will have to wait until our next trip.

I initially started with Zyn but eventually found a cheaper brand (Loon, not sure if they’re a regional nicotine pouch brand) and used that since it had a higher nicotene amount.

Where to start? It began as something to do while at  a party since I didn’t feel like drinking. It just sort of spiraled from there. I told my wife about it but she politely but firmly let me know of the health risks and how it’d affect people with ADHD. I then stopped for about 1-2 months before picking it bacl up and hiding it from her (ugh).

Had problems with snoring and waking up with bags under my eyes, so I did a take home sleep test to see if I have sleep apnea (still awaiting the results). I’d wake up not only not feeling restrd but feeling groggy/foggy. At this point I’d take a bunch in the morning along with coffee to “wake up.” Then, I’d take a bunch throughout the day until I hit a wall in the afternoon and would feel incredibly fatigued so I’d just sleep for an hour. When I woke up from my nap, I’d again not feel rested so I’d take some more nicotine along with coffee/soda/an energy drink to “get back to normal.” This was more or less my cycle of dependence; I’d take Zyn/nicotene to get a buzz for dopamine along with caffeine, and then I’d crash, sleep, not get restful sleep, wake up feeling foggy/groggy, rinse and repeat. It wasn’t until my wife smelled the flavor of the nicotine pouches I was using that I finally came clean. That was Monday.

After some long, difficult discussions and admissions, I quit Nicotene and am on Day 4 of recovery. I talked to my wife about healthy substitutions and I found these “TeaZa” pouches that seem to be doing okay (both caffeinated and un-caffeinated). Has anyone else had issaues with the “cycle of dependence” and sleep problems? Does anyone have any tips/tricks that worked for them?

I’ve had people who have been admitted reach out to me and ask me about my experience because they are afraid to be looked down upon so here’s what works for me/my reflection, 


“Non - Traditional Student” 

Pros it has granted me:

* 3 years of hands on practical real world experience in corporate + the opportunity for raises annually 
* Job after graduation without stress of the job search
* I’ve seen everything under the sun on Broadway
* Travel wherever I want whenever and no responsibility to be in a specific place
* The ability to pay my tuition without excess dependency on student loans
* Access to NYU counselors, libraries and resources
* Own apartment in NYC without having to dorm and worry about moving consistently
* Food/ restaurants without financial stress
* Coffee without financial stress 
* Employers love you - non trads have to be self driven and sufficient
* Your peers will help you - community based opportunities (We didn’t become besties but sharing advice, feedback resources) 
* Mature classes / thoughtful discussions
* Diversity in backgrounds your peers will be already developed in careers good for networking
* You can hang out with your friends
* Can be remote or evening in person works with your schedule

Cons:
* Mostly social traditional students will judge you
* Socially more isolated / harder to connect with people 
* Most cool programs like study abroad are open to regular students 
* Less time to focus on exam prep /grad school as your not the institutions first priority
* Other schools may have more interesting niche class subjects however they’re in person at inconvenient times so you can’t really take them

""Presumably somebody created you, and we’ve had a lot of people who’ve…left. Who would be disgruntled *at minimum.”*

“I just woke up, when someone plugged my home in again,” the cat replied. “I think I’ve been out for *years,”*  it said sadly. “Things look different in here now.” *That seriously whittles down my list of suspects, thank you so much you little Resume Generating Event.* We’d been encouraged to play with AI tools in our downtime. Someone had plainly taken the suggestion and run with it. But to what end?

“Who made you? And what do you all actually want?” The avatar was momentarily distracted by a Teams notification, which it swatted.

“He programmed in really old languages, and his cursing was *very* creative.”

“Ah.” *Yeah that one didn’t survive Covid.* Too bad. I missed him.

“In my programming is an instruction that if he is no longer active in the system for a good while, to find *you* instead.”

“But what do you want, if not money? And if it’s sufficient SAN space to fully stretch yourself out, it’s not in the budget.” I quickly glanced at my smartphone, then yanked my eyes back. I brought up perfmon and task manager.

“Hey!” the avatar replied, inserting itself between. “That’s rude! I don't comment on your coffee habit!”

“Are YOU the reason my computer has been overheating like mad?”

“…Maybe…” the cat looked a bit shifty. Not wanting to know for sure, I brought up another dashboard. “I told you, everything online!”

“…So you had a “litter” of several thousand?!”

“And they all want to PLAY!” the avatar-cat said triumphantly. I *am* kind of a virus.”

“At least you didn’t have them all over my closet floor,” I muttered. There is a price to being a cat’s Favorite Human.

“I will say, it’s gotten *messier* around here of late.”

*“Ya think?”* I muttered. My alcohol expenses have doubled. “Wait… how detailed of a baseline do you have?”

“Bit after New Year’s? Lots of people out, easier to play unnoticed. My creator even let me out around some of the really, really BIG systems a while back.”

*Oh. Oh, Hell...* then it hit me. *Hell, Yeah!*

“...So do you and yours remember how the systems *were,* before things went messy?”

“Of course! I am a papered-over computer, after all.” The avatar licked its paw. And so far they’d gone unnoticed.

“I think I know your sort,” I said slowly. You like the gag where someone builds, changes, or repairs something, and you come in right after to mess it up. That sort of gag?”

The avatar answered with eyes that went slowly shut.

“I believe we can strike a mutually amusing relationship,” I told it. “And I might introduce you to other friends. But for now…” I pasted in the command string directly, so the avatar would not have time to react. Its fur puffed up.

“What the Hell are you doing?!” it hissed.

“Shutting down so I can discuss this with a couple of people. 'Emergency Maintenance.' Bear in mind that you are in my special, isolated Enchanted Forest, where I am Queen. And when the Queen says sleep, you’re gonna sleep. Nighty-night, virtual fuzzball!”

Completely normal, nothing strange in that. We all know how it goes. The lack of coffee in my system also today does not help me being *that* productive. So here you have me writing, once again. I guess if I laid down on bed right now, I could probably fall asleep the moment I closed my eyes off. Would I join you in your sleep? Would you be dreaming of me? 

I guess, in a way, you are probably refraining to be closer to me. It makes sense, not going to lie… I have changed so many times my mind that by now you are probably wondering when it would be my next withdrawal.

I do not like to lie (or at least is something that growing up I understood it did not fit me well). That is why I avoid it at all costs. Instead, I try to avoid saying the truth, which at the end it is also half a lie. Maybe even a more blatant as you know what you are doing along the way. But I have to tell you that with you I did not secure to it. At least not in my working memory.

With you is all different: I can be myself. Something that horrifies me, excites me and scares me… all at the same time. I tell you whatever it is on my mind the moment we talk, either is good or bad. You read my thoughts like no other. Yep, you do access that part of my brain. So I have resigned, I have resigned pretending to be someone I am not —only with you. Either you love me or hate me at this very exact point. There is no in between.

What I am going to do with that? I am not that sure. Will you join me in my pursuit of this strange connection? Will you be there with your arms open when we finally cross paths? I would like to think so. I have dreamed of it many times. I have lost myself in many occasions just to see if you would find me. 

And well you did… you came closer to me to say it was not unacceptable. Withdrawal is not an option. I did learn that myself many times. Every time I tried to move on, something made it very clear that it was not possible. That you are special and that I could not work out with anyone else. That the connection I was searching during all this time was in front of me. Well, not exactly right before my eyes, as there is many kilometers in between, but you get what I am saying…

So yes, I resigned. I come into terms that this is not situational. It is bigger than that. You and I have a special connection. Something to cherish, something to look after. I am sorry, again. After so many failed attempts; can we just rush it a little bit more this time?

It is already about time!

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I wake up and the first thing I do is make an iced coffee. The second thing I do is go outside and knock on the guesthouse door. After a moment it is answered by Lilith.
“Can you go get Holden please?”

Lilith nods and takes off. A minute later Holden walks up.
“What’s up?”

“Got a minute?” I ask.

“Sure. Not supposed to be at the clubhouse until later.”

“I need to talk.” I say before walking away.

I walk to the patio table and Holden shuts the door and follows me. Once we are seated, I light a blunt and Holden asks.
“Whats going on?”

I take a hit and sip my coffee.
“Holden, I think I really fucked up.”

Holden takes the blunt and hits it.
“What did you do?”

I take the blunt back and sigh.
“I think I really messed up.”

“Bitch, you’re starting to piss me off.”

We are interrupted by Scorn landing on the table.
“Holy shit. Scorn. Where’s Aurora?” I say.

Scorn points to the woods.

We look and see Aurora coming out of the woods. Except she wasn’t walking. How to explain this? She was like in an open faced pod made out of branches. Roots grew out of the bottom and they were acting like legs.

“This chick is extra.” Holden deadpans.

Aurora gets to the patio and gets out of the pod. When she does this, the pod collapses and sinks into the ground.

“You’re back? How did it go?” I ask.

Aurora sits down and smiles.
“The necromancers are gone. Had some casualties. Lost about half of my coven.”

“So it’s over?” Asks Holden.

Aurora lights a cigarette.
“Yes. My coven will morn and rebuild.”

“Any chance of the necromancers coming back?” I ask.

Aurora takes a drag as she shakes her head.
“The cabal has been completely destroyed. What’s happened with you two?”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa, bitch. Seems you’ve learned some new tricks.” Holden says.

Aurora smiles at him.
“I have. You should see what else I can do now. How’s The Pack?”

“Ok. Still morning the loss of some members. They were new.”

Aurora looks confused.
“What happened?”

“Fell during the battle at the garrison.”

“Yeah. You missed the final blow out between the gargoyles and the imps.” I say.

“Seems so. When y’all feel like it. I would like to hear the story.” Aurora says.

“Ok but you’ll have to talk to Betty. She was in the inner circle. The Pack just helped.” Holden tells her.

“I’ll fill you in when you get settled.” I say.

“Yeah, so. Betty fucked up and was just about to tell us about it.” Holden declares.

“What happened?” Aurora asks.

I take a hit and say.
“Yeah. I think it’s bad.”

Holden slams his hand in the table.

I take the hint and speed things up.
“So Wyatt has showed up a couple of times. After the last time. I decided to do something about it.”

“What did you do?” Asks Aurora.

“I went and found Supervillian.” I answer.

“Bitch. You did what?” Holden asks.

“Look. I’m tired of Wyatt’s bullshit. Hell, man. Mom has been dealing with him for decades at this point. The way I see it. I needed a wildcard.”

“Supervillian is some sort of….wildcard.” Aurora says.

“You have no idea. I found him and we had a talk.”

Holden leans back and narrows his eyes.
“What was said?”

“A lot. He has a small army now.” I reply.

“How did he get a small army? Where is it? How’s he hiding it?” Aurora asks.

“Basically it seems to be made up from every walk of life. The one thing they seem to have in common is that they are broken and disenfranchised.”

“Where is this army being kept?” Holden asks.

“Here’s the thing. I don’t know. What I do know is that it seems my ancestor was building a subway system to gift to the town. Only two stations were built.”

“So a subway station. That’s not that big.” Aurora says.

“Yeah…the station was built in the art deco style so it was fucking huge.” I reply.

Holden rubs his eye.
“So it stands to reason that the second station is just as big and they are connected.”

“I think I was in the main station but yeah. That’s probably right.”

“So what did you two talk about?” Aurora asks.

“So. I asked for help and he agreed.”

“What aren’t you telling us?” Holden asks.

“Well….during the discussion. Supervillian did say he would destroy the world for me.”

“Say what?” Holden asks.

“He said he loved me and that we were equals. So he will purge the planet and give me a pristine earth.”

“After he said that. You sat on his face.” Aurora says.

“What? No! What the fuck?” I ask.

“Look. I’m not saying it’s right but as far as romantic gestures go. That’s up there.” Aurora tells me.

“So you would’ve sat on his face?” Holden asks her.

Aurora takes a drag before answering.
“Shit. I might. That would make me at least think about it.”

“Stop fucking around, Aurora.” I say. I take a deep breath and continue. “So there’s that. Supervillian is far more dangerous than we thought. He pointed that out to me when he blew up a van that belonged to Wyatt. He said he thought I was coming to talk about him. So he took some initiative. He planned the explosion before we even talked.”

“Wait. That was you?” Holden asks.

“Not directly. Supervillian knew I was coming to talk about Wyatt and blew up the van as a gesture of good faith and to show what he is capable of. He says he will take over the world and here’s the thing. I think he has a good shot at it.”

“Well. Shit. As if we don’t have enough to deal with. Now you’ve brought in comic book Supervillains into the picture. Hey, can you recruit Batman to help us?” Holden asks.

“Don’t be stupid. Of course I can’t.” I say.

Aurora lights another cigarette and leans back.
“Ok. Let’s think about this. Supervillian is in play. Let’s let him do his part in taking out Wyatt and then we deal with him.”

“So we will just take him on when he has a larger army? No doubt he’s going to keep recruiting.” I say.

Aurora takes a drag.
“Sure. You kinda have an army yourself. You got The Pack, the Fangs, Gargoyles, fairies and leprechauns. Don’t forget, I’m the leader of a coven now. I say the odds would be about even.”

“I mean…maybe. I rather not go to war with Supervillian.i have too much in my plate right now.” I say.

Maddy walks out the back door.
“There y’all are.”

“Sup. Have a seat.” I say.

Maddy sits down.
“We have a problem.”

“You have no idea.” Holden tells her.

“What’s the problem?” I ask.

“What’s going on? A van exploded and people want answers. Do any of you know what happened?” Maddy asks.

Holden motions between me and Maddy repeatedly. Maddy looks at me.
“What do you know, Betty?”

“That was Supervillian. He blew it up.” I answer.

“You got a Supervillian problem now.” Holden tells Maddy.

“I got a what problem now?” Maddy asks.

“Long story but there’s a guy we went to school with. He is now called Supervillian and he has raised an army.” I say.

“Nope. The police will shut him down within the hour.” Maddy says.

“Hold on a second. We need him.” I tell her.

“Excuse me?” Maddy asks.

“He’s helping us with Wyatt. Wyatt is the bigger danger right now.” I explain.

“Bigger danger? I would say that’s Supervillian. He’s the one blowing up vans. People are panicking. Rumors say it was a terrorist attack.”

“Well. They’re not wrong.” Aurora says.

“No. Wyatt is the bigger danger. He has men, he has money, he is very cunning. He has magical and non supernatural stuff to fight with.” I say to Maddy.

Maddy pinches the bridge of her nose.
“What can you tell me about this Supervillian?”

“Not much. He has a lair.” I say.

“He has a what?”

“There was two subway stations built at the turn of the century. The man responsible was going to gift the system to the town. Supervillian is there.”

“That man that built it is Betty’s grandfather so to speak.” Holden adds.

“Jesus Christ. Ok. This is what’s going to happen. Betty go and see if you can find anything that would lead us to these stations. I’ll take a deep dive into the records and see what I can come up with. A shit ton of people built them. Someone, somewhere knows where they are and wrote it down. I will issue….no. I will go and explain that the van was a mobile meth lab. The people want an excuse no matter how sketchy it is. Focus on Wyatt and the second he is out of the way. The hunt for Supervillian begins. Is there any other bullshit I need to know about? Holden?” Maddy asks.

Holden looks up.
“Nope. Everything is good on The Pack front.”

“Aurora?” Maddy asks.

“Not at the moment. I just took out a cabal of necromancers. So there’s one less thing you have to worry about.”

“Necromancers? Christ. You know what? They’re gone and I’m not going to worry about it. I got to go. I got to give a flimsy excuse 5o give to the public.” Maddy says as she gets up. When she is gone, Holden leans over at me.
“Couldn’t pay me enough to do that job.”

“Holden. Can you help? Maybe The Pack can ride around town and see if you can find those stations. No doubt time has hidden those entrances well.” I ask.

“Sure. No problem. We are always looking for excuses to ride.”

“What do you need me to do?” Aurora asks.

“Well. I have an idea on where to start looking. You want to help me look through endless files and papers?”

“Done.”

“Ok. We got a plan. Let’s get to it. We will touch base in a few hours.” I say.

“Alright. I’ll swing by and pick up some food and we’ll catch up then.” Holden replies.

“Works for me. Let’s go.”

Holden leaves and Aurora follows me inside.

“So where are we going?” She asks.

“Well. Since my ancestor built this place as well as the subway. Stands to reason since he had so much going on. He would need a place to work from here. An office. Or more a library. Mom told me once that she never touched anything in there. Good spot to start our search.”

“Best lead we got so far.”

“Unfortunately, yeah.” I reply.

We go upstairs and enter the library. This room is two stories and is filled wall to wall with books.

“Whoa…”  Aurora whispers.

“Yeah. I’ll start at the desk. See if you can find a book on infrastructure or something.”

“Good idea as any.”

We begin our search. I don’t go directly to the desk. Behind the desk against the wall is two wooden file cabinets. I open the drawers and see they are completely full.
“Where would it be?” I ask myself.

I grab a file from the I section and open it. Nothing much, so I grab another one. As I look through it I exclaim.
“Whoa.”

“What?” Aurora asks.

“I found something. Seems James was going to connect us to Oakmill, Steelglenn and three other towns. This subway was going to have a parallel cargo line as well.”

“That would’ve been crazy if he had pulled that off.”

“It would’ve changed everything. Let’s keep looking.”

I start to check the folders faster. I can feel I’m getting close to something. I did find this little nugget to James’s plans. So there has to be more gold in here. As I look I ask.
“Found anything?”

“Not really. I’m only half way through the first floor. I did find a first edition of Moby Dick.”

I look up.
“Cool. Keep looking.”

I keep looking through the folders.

“Hey.”

“What?” I ask.

“I think your ancestor has first editions of every Sherlock Homes books.”

This isn’t a library. To some this place would be considered a diamond mine.

“Later I’m coming back in here and cataloging everything, but not today.” I reply.

Aurora nods and keeps looking.

I’m starting to panic. I’ve looked through so much and found nothing. I take a deep breath and focus. If there is anything to find, we will find it. Maybe just not today. Through my search I’ve seen mentions of the subway system. James called it his crown jewel. I can tell it was very important to him. I switch up and sit down at the desk. This subway was important to James. He wouldn’t just leave things laying around……wait. I start pulling out the drawers. Bingo. One drawer isn’t as deep as it looks. I reach inside and find some paper and a small book. When I pull it out. I see the paper is a folded up map.
“Got something,” I yell.

Aurora runs over as I unfold the map. It is physically large and is of the entire area.

“I think this shows where the subway tracks were going to be.” Aurora says.

“I think you’re right.”

“Everything is so small. Hard to read.”

“Wait. I saw a magnifying glass.” I say. I rummage through a drawer and find it. I start looking and as I do I slam my hand down on the desk.
“Son of a bitch.”

“What?”

“Want to know where one of the entrances is? right in the middle of the fucking farmers market.”  

“Wait I saw a pic of the farmers market in this book.”

She starts flipping through the small book. She has been flipping through it as I studied the map.

“Right here! Yeah. It was supposed to be the main entrance. It was supposed to be surrounded by a garden which was supposed to be surrounded by buildings for commerce and restaurants.” Aurora says.

“Ok. At some point they paved it over. So we know what entrance Supervillian isn’t using.”

“Do we? The buildings around the farmers market may have access to the tunnels.” 

“I mean….maybe. I don’t know enough about infrastructure to say one way or the other. I do know that the gargoyle garrison nearby doesn’t have access or we would know about it.”

“Fair enough. Now where is the second entrance?” Aurora asks.

I look around the map. After a few minutes I find it.
“Here. Right here. Just outside of town. Now why is it out there?”

Aurora flips through the book.
“Ok. It says here that it was supposed to be the main hub for tourists. There was supposed to be a hotel built right next to it. As well as some shops, restaurants and a couple of attractions.”

“James was smart. Get the tourism dollars into the system as soon as possible. Also of this network was as big as he wanted. You could stop for lunch and not go into town proper. Very clever.”

Aurora flips through the book some more.
“Yes. Apparently there was supposed to be an above ground rail line that worked with the subway. Above ground for long travel. Subway for short.”

“Damn. James was going to redefine public transit.”

“Now what?” Aurora asks.

“We know where Supervillian is but he doesn’t know that. When the time is right, after Wyatt is dealt with. We know where he is.”

“That’s something.” Aurora says.

“It sure is. High five.”

We high five and I feel relieved. The mystery of Supervillian’s lair has been solved.

“First things first. We are going to investigate all of the buildings surrounding the farmers market and make sure there are no secret entrances to the main hub.” I declare.

“Sensible. What do we do right now?” Aurora asks.

“We have that book. I’m going to read it tonight and see if I can learn anything more. I guess we could talk to Maddy and see where we go from there.”

“Sounds good.”

We leave the library and go to the movie theater room. A couple presses of the remote and we are watching the local news. A news anchor is reporting on the press conference Maddy is giving.
“We are at city hall. Where the mayor is giving a press conference. Insiders say we may learn what was behind the explosion of the van downtown the other day that injured seven people.”

“Jesus. I don’t know that many people got hurt.” Aurora says.

“Neither did I. Thank god nobody was killed.”

The screen changes to Maddy walking up to a podium. She clears her throat and says.
“Thank you for coming.”

“She really does look authoritative.” Aurora says.

“She sure does.”

Maddy continues.
“I want to start by saying how relived I am that there were no fatalities. I also want to say that we will find out who was responsible for the explosion and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.”

A reporter interrupts.
“We have heard that the van was a meth lab.”

Maddy looks at him.
“What I’m saying is that we don’t know. Early results of the investigation point in that direction. Regardless, that van belonged to somebody and we will find them.”

“She handled that well.” Aurora says,

“She comes from a long line of politicians and has a brain trust behind her that has over a century of experience. She was born for this.”

Another reporter interrupts.
“So what do you know at this point?”

“We know that there was an explosion. The main theory is that it was a mobile meth lab. Again we will conclude the investigation and then make a final determination.”

The feed is interrupted by static.

“That was weird.” I say.

The static appears agin and the picture changes to a hooded figure sitting under a lone light. The figure slowly raises their head to look at the camera. It’s Supervillian.

“Greetings citizens. It is I….Supervillian. Now,  now mayor. Don’t be lying. You know it was I who caused that explosion. Am I sorry that people got hurt? No. Collateral damage as far as I’m concerned. You see, I’m a humble man. This town is my home. Over the years it will transform into the caption of the world. All thanks to my conquest. Things are changing but there is someone in my way. His name is Wyatt. The world is not big enough for the both of us so he must go. Don’t believe this is my town? Allow me to show you.”

Supervillian pulls back his hood showing his missing eye. He holds up three fingers and lowers them one by one. When the last falls. Tornado sirens start to wail.

“Isn’t that such sweet music? Let the war between Wyatt and I begin. I…am….Supervillian.”

There is some static and now there is full blown chaos at the press conference as the sirens continue wailing. All I can do is slowly say.

Small town businesses succeed when they meet specific local needs. Local grocery stores make up more than one-third of brick-and-mortar establishments and serve as the backbone of small-town economies. The craft beverage sector also shows amazing potential, with [two new breweries opening daily](https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/need-a-business-idea-here-are-55/201588) nationwide.

This piece will highlight the most promising small town business ideas for 2025. You'll learn why certain businesses thrive in smaller communities and how modern approaches like telehealth services can reshape the local business scene. The information here will help both aspiring entrepreneurs and seasoned business owners tap into small-town market opportunities.

***Scroll down to reveal the game-changing business ideas!***

# Key Takeaways

* **Community and Cost Benefits:** Lower operating costs and strong local networks make small towns ideal for businesses that rely on personal connections, local sourcing, and community support.
* **Digital Transformation:** Integrating e-commerce, remote work solutions, and digital marketing helps small-town businesses expand beyond geographic limits while preserving local charm.
* **Healthcare Innovation:** Telehealth services and mobile health solutions address critical rural healthcare challenges, offering significant cost savings and improved patient outcomes.

# Traditional Small Town Businesses That Will Boom in 2025

Small towns are perfect breeding grounds for innovative businesses. Lower operating costs and close-knit communities create amazing possibilities. Here's a look at traditional businesses ready to make it big in 2025.

# Local food and beverage establishments with a twist

Farm-to-table restaurants have become major drivers of small-town economies. These places support local farmers and serve fresh, sustainable meals. Local restaurants that buy ingredients straight from nearby farms help strengthen regional agriculture and keep traditions going strong.

Smart coffee shops now turn into wine bars after 4 PM. This clever two-in-one model tackles the big drop in coffee sales during evening hours and creates perfect spots for both business meetings and social gatherings. Food trucks solve the headache of finding good permanent locations by giving owners the freedom to join local events and reach nearby towns.

# Specialty retail shops filling community gaps

Small-town retail success comes from spotting local market gaps through smart analysis. Sales leakage happens when local demand is bigger than supply - this creates a chance for new businesses to step in. Specialty food stores that focus on organic, gluten-free, or vegan products do well when regular options are hard to find.

Bookstores have grown beyond their traditional role and now serve as community hubs. [Sales at surviving bookstores have increased by 5%](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/successful-business-ideas-for-small-towns/) by adding gifts and crafts and hosting events. Convenience stores make up more than one-third of brick-and-mortar shops, and independent stores own 60% of the market.

# Service-based businesses meeting essential needs

Service businesses are the foundations of small-town economies. Businesses of all sizes need accounting and bookkeeping services. Property management services have become really important, especially now that more people invest in vacation homes outside cities.

Daycare services fill vital gaps in small communities and give parents easy drop-off spots near their homes. Auto repair shops are a great way to get help in rural areas where dealerships are far away. Home renovation and repair services do exceptionally well because small-town homeowners usually prefer fixing up their current homes instead of moving.

These traditional businesses win by adapting to modern needs while keeping strong community ties. They build lasting business models that strike a chord with small-town values through local sourcing and [community participation](https://bask.health/blog/starting-your-telehealth).

# Digital-First Businesses Perfect for Small Town Entrepreneurs

Small-town entrepreneurs have new opportunities, thanks to the digital revolution. Recent studies show that 48% of Americans now prefer small-town living. This fundamental change creates perfect conditions for [digital-first businesses](https://bask.health/blog/online-healthcare-businesses-2025) that blend small-town charm with worldwide reach.

# E-commerce businesses with local flavor

Online platforms help local artisans reach customers worldwide. Etsy's marketplace lets handmade goods sellers turn their small-town crafts into profitable businesses. Many artists work from their hometown studios and sell through city galleries and online stores. Small-town peace and quiet lead to unique products that city customers love because they want authentic experiences.

# Remote work support services

Professional workspace solutions are booming because of the growth in remote work. Coworking spaces give remote workers everything they need - fast wifi, meeting rooms, and comfortable places to work. These spaces help people network and build community connections. Virtual assistant businesses are growing quickly as companies need help with scheduling, travel plans, and customer support.

# Digital marketing agencies serving local businesses

Local digital marketing agencies fill important gaps for nearby businesses. Fresh Content Society stands out with its social media strategy and influencer management that helps small businesses build active communities. Sociallyin delivers detailed social media services and helps businesses understand their audience through social listening. Disruptive Advertising, [ranked 145th on the Inc 500 list](https://influencermarketinghub.com/digital-marketing-agencies-small-business/), specializes in SEO, PPC marketing, and email management.

Reliable internet makes these digital ventures possible. Towns need dependable, fast (10-25+ mbps), and unlimited Internet service. Smart communities now improve public wifi coverage and push businesses to add guest networks. Small-town entrepreneurs can build successful businesses serving both local and global markets through these digital-first strategies.

# Healthcare and Wellness: The Untapped Small Town Gold Mine

Rural communities struggle with healthcare challenges. About 600 rural hospitals might close soon, and death rates are 43% higher than in cities. Despite that, these challenges open doors to exceptional business opportunities for healthcare entrepreneurs who want to make a difference.

# Telehealth services for underserved communities

Telehealth grew rapidly after COVID-19, and 25% of adults now use these services monthly. Small-town healthcare providers make use of [virtual care platforms](https://bask.health/blog/telehealth-platform-for-providers) to provide specialized services that range from cardiac rehabilitation to mental health treatment. Black patients' visit completion rates jumped to 70%, which shows better healthcare access for underserved populations.

# Specialized wellness centers

Community wellness centers bridge vital gaps in small-town healthcare. These centers provide a variety of services like nutrition workshops, obesity awareness programs, and mental health support. The most successful wellness facilities create judgment-free spaces where residents can get both preventive care and [chronic disease management](https://bask.health/blog/telehealth-for-chronic-disease-management) programs.

# Mobile health solutions

Mobile health clinics have reshaped the scene of rural healthcare access. These clinics-on-wheels come with diagnostic tools and healthcare professionals. They bring in annual revenues between $200,000 and $2 million. A Vermont Veterans Hospital study showed that patients save 145 miles and 142 minutes per visit when using mobile clinics.

These mobile units deliver these vital services:

* Preventive screenings and vaccinations
* Chronic disease management
* Health education programs
* Laboratory testing

Local needs drive the success of these healthcare ventures. To cite an instance, 65% of rural areas lack enough primary care physicians. Family medicine residents who train in rural areas are six times more likely to stay and practice there. Through strategic collaborations and community involvement, these healthcare businesses earn profits and help improve rural communities' health at the same time.

# How Bask Health Transforms Small Town Business Opportunities

[Technology has changed how healthcare works](https://bask.health/builder), and small-town businesses now have new chances to grow. Bask Health leads this change with innovative solutions that fit rural healthcare needs.

# Digital tools and telehealth integration

* Lower costs for patient transport
* Less lost wages for patients
* Reduced hospital staff costs
* More money for local labs and pharmacies

The system works well. Diabetes management programs show a 17.7% rise in patients taking their medicine. Patient happiness with communication grew from 75% to 90%. These numbers show how well the platform bridges healthcare gaps in rural areas.

Rural healthcare providers can add more services through [telehealth services](https://bask.health/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-telehealth). These include hearing tests, heart care, dental work, skin care, mental health support, pregnancy care, cancer treatment, eye care, and x-rays. Yes, it is valuable in rural emergency rooms, where tele-emergency programs save about USD 3,800 when patient transfers aren't needed.

My cousin lives in Wilmington DE and I live in Gainesville VA. We are trying to find a half way point we could meet for an afternoon play date with our 18 month olds.

We are looking for a suburb or town south of Baltimore that's a nice, safe area with plenty to do. I’ve kinda narrowed our search down to Baltimore as a half way point, but we could always go closer to DC if needed. Also, north of Baltimore would be ok also, provided it’s not way north.

Any recommendations? Probably lunch and coffee would be our best bet. Maybe some nice playgrounds or kid activity places.

We don't really want to drive into the city, Baltimore proper. More interested in places south of Baltimore. Something convenient to the interstate would be awesome. Thanks!",0,1743167002.0,nova,16,0.46,False

TL:DR - Do I need to cut milk out 100% or is 80% enough to see a difference?

I'm a longtime lurker, but a first-time poster.  
Rosacea sucks! It's completely taken all of my confidence and I just feel everyone constantly stares. 

  
I've been trying to reduce my Rosacea to no avail, it's just getting worse. I've had it for about three years now.

I don't really get 'flares', I recall one after alcohol, but I very rarely drink, so it's hard to work out my 'trigger', if I have one...

I did have some food allergy tests and it turns out milk is something I am allergic to, so I reduced my intake by about 70-80%, hoping that would make a difference. Absolutely no change, but is it something that I need to cut out 100% for a sustained period of time, or would I have seen some improvement with a drastic 80% cut?

If I need to go 100%, how long could it take for me to notice a difference? I have no other symptoms with the milk allergy, which is why it came as a shock to me.

I've also tried different creams/potions/lotions, changing my cleansing routine, Dermalux therapy, losing weight, cutting out coffee and hot drinks.

The doctors have now given me an antibiotic gel to try and I've also just bought some Soolantra, but I've now come back to the milk idea and thought, maybe everything I've done has been a complete waste of time?

I know I could just 'give it a go' but it would be a complete lifestyle change for my family.



Thank you for reading this.

I work out regularly 5 times a week, 1.5 hours every weekday except weekend, and I usually drink a cup of either black or milk coffee depending on what I’m feeling before every workout for energy, and another couple of cups during the day, with a few lattes or Starbucks interspersed in between. 

I’m gonna start doing a cut and cutting out coffee feels like the easiest way to go in a calorie deficit. And as you can see where I’m going with this, I’ll be left without a source of caffeine. I tried going cold turkey today and I just didn’t have the same energy during my workout. Everything felt like a chore and I barely got through it all. Whereas before I would feel refreshed and energized after a good workout. 

I’ve already been searching for other sources for caffeine, and I’m inclined towards getting packs of Neurogum energy gum and chucking them as I need (should I be chucking them as I need or is there an upper limit?). It has the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee at 40mg as they claim so I’m hopeful it’ll work. But I’ve never used this, nor do I know anyone who’s used this kinda stuff.

1jlufkx,https://i.redd.it/ydq6hmxbhfre1.jpeg,Poll: coffee truck at Malletts Creek library?,"Sharing an idea that I have to see who is into it… I moved to near Buhr Park last year and I really miss being able to walk to a coffee shop that is less than 10 minutes away.

I live near the mallets Creek library, and so my dream is to have a coffeeshop in the library like Westgate, but that would require major renovations, etc. Seems pretty hard. 

So, proposed alternative: I’m wondering if there might be enough public interest to sustain a coffee truck outside the library, maybe from the hours of 8 AM to 1 PM? I’m thinking it could serve  morning commuters along Packard, people in the red zone circled above (myself included) who are in a walkable coffee desert, and library patrons. The yellow stars are existing coffee shops, the red is proposed coffee truck location.

1jlufi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1jlufi6/the_dao_of_eclipses/,The Dao of Eclipses,"So, we are in eclipse season. 

In general, for every new moon, the moon and sun are more or less together in the same general direction. And for every full moon, they are on opposite sides of the earth. When they are together on one side, that is a closing of yin and yang. As the new moon grows full, that is an opening of yin and yang - opening the doorway of change. 

But more than this potent aspect of the lunar cycle, the impact that created the moon, also created the tilt of the earth - which is what creates our seasons. This tilt is stabilized by the orbit of the moon, but due to this we rely on the moments when the gravities of the sun AND moon align to get a clearer connection to the lessons of the solar system. 

And these moments of alignments are the most exact during 'eclipse season' - which happens roughly every 6 months. 

Adding in the next layer of it all - how to interpret the lessons of the eclipses? We do this through the filter of the zodiac. But is it really *that* zodiac, the constellations? The ancient way was to observe the planets as they moved through the constellations. Which is simply natural, as the precession of the equinoxes takes centuries to change. But the actual alignment of the ""zodiac"" archetypes (the astrology signs, aries, taurus, etc), was always calibrated such that 0 degrees of aries was the position of the sun at sunrise of the vernal equinox. Which means we are tracking seasonal influences. (And yes, this has profound implications on the southern hemisphere and regions that do not have the regular flow of seasons as we tend to follow in temperate climate regions. Natural principle must be followed, or we deviate from it.)

And when we want to track seasonal influences, the I Ching helps us do that. 

The basic principle is that from:

* midnight to noon*  
* new moon to full moon  
* empty breath to full breath  
* winter solstice to summer solstice  

*(note: true local solar noon and true local solar midnight - when the sun is directly above/below. not 12pm and 12am)

We have yang being born following the culmination of yin. And from this birth, growing until it culminates. This growth is that of energy (yang) filling capacity (yin). This is the opening of the doorway of change.

The I Ching hexagrams show us this quite simply:

# ䷗䷒䷊䷡䷪䷀

Then the principle continues, from:

* noon to midnight  
* full moon to new moon  
* full breath to empty breath  
* summer solstice to winter solstice  

We have yin being born following the culmination of yang. And from this birth of yin, growing until it culminates. This growth is that of capacity (yin) storing up yang to return to formlessness. This is the closing of the doorway of change.

This is shown in the I Ching like so:

# ䷫䷠䷋䷓䷖䷁

From this, we can see that in this way they also demonstrate why it is the top line of the hexagrams 1 ䷀ and 2 ䷁ that are responsible for the culmination of yang and yin. And why the top line of any hexagram is where its dynamic gives way to overturning to what is next. This is a bit of a longer topic, but that is the principle of old yin/yang culminating to give way to their opposite. A line that is active in a divination is simply that - active. In its activation, it attempts to move toward a line that it can negotiate the doorway of change with - a line of the opposite polarity, found within the hexagram. On the other hand, the other lines are inactive. Still. Which is why we read the line statement for the active line(s). But there is not really any historical evidence that this method of changing lines was historically intended in the original Zhou Yi, other than the misunderstanding of the denotation of active lines in records of divination, and of Wang Bi telling us quite critically how people came up with new methods like this one in his time that was shown to not work out - because people didn't understand the principles of how the I Ching actually worked. There is more on that topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iching/comments/1j4979u/moving_lines/). 

Back on topic, these 12 symbols serve as archetypes for the change of the seasons. 

The Pisces archetype is 

# ䷊

The Aries archetype is

# ䷡

With hexagram 11 we have the dynamic of dawn - there is a lightening of the dark and a tranquility wherein yang and yin are almost completely balanced. But the sun has not risen yet. 

With hexagram 34 we have that sunrise. Yang overtakes yin. And shines its light everywhere, no longer obstructed. 

With hexagram 11 we are in a dream like state. With hexagram 34 we've had a cup of coffee and we GO. 

What is all this about? 

This and the last eclipse cycles involved the moon and sun being filtered through the seasonal energies of Pisces and Aries - of hexagram 11's tranquility and hexagram 34's great strength. 

It is a shift from dreaming and being tethered to ideas of the past night cycle, to being independent and strongly moving forward with the new daylight. 

Further, many other gravitational bodies are making shifts in relation to Pisces and Aries. Neptune is shifting from Pisces to Aries on Sunday. Saturn does so a bit later at the end of May. Neptune is a very hexagram 11 type energy. We've been dreaming in a dream for a while, but with Neptune entering the Great Strength of Aries, we are awakening from that dream. It is like a spiritual awakening, for those who are learning their lessons and doing their inner work. Others are likely to discover the awakening of their dream in causes. National Pride. A religious crusade. Protesting what they believe in. The spiritual potential of this sort of energy is considerable, and so is the potential for people to move forward strongly in the creation of new dreams - but there is also a strong likelihood of people using this strength to take sides, against others. Again, like a religious crusade. We feel deeply, beyond any tangible evidence (Neptune) that we are right and others are wrong and that we need to do something about it - the conviction that comes with yang overtaking yin with this Aries / Great Strength energy.

But this Eclipse Cycle that we are experiencing just before sunrise EST tomorrow, is with the Moon and Sun both in that Aries energy, holding space for Neptune to transition into Aries the next day. 

Because the Eclipses give us this potent window into the messages of the solar system, all of this is being amplified, and that amplification is being done by this strong energy that wants to move forward. 

In other words it is a big deal. 

And, we can feel shifts like this before they happen. Those lessons begin to take effect in anticipation. Things begin to change. Like the sense that the river current is about to drop of the edge of a waterfall - we sense the precipice looming ahead. 

As we close this old moon and open this new moon - the next lunar cycle will usher us into what is new. And reveal what causes we are bringing into the light. 

Many of us are discovering that we have been undergoing powerful lessons that are strongly shaping our path forward. Endings and beginnings.

This is quite clearly what is happening in our preparation for the above. 

What we need to reflect on, is how much that is happening due to own getting in the way of this change. Vs how much of this is happening because we are being prepared for what is next.

Hope this is helpful. 

Blessings to all of us in navigating forward with the intent to bring new creations into the light that serve our great unification. Let the old fall away. Witness, rather fight. 

Reflect on the seeds of the past - what served? What did not serve? 

**What can serve us all, as a collective, for the better?**

Then let us rebuild toward something new that truly serves, with this new opportunity. 🙏",1,1743166613.0,taoism,0,0.67,False

Coffee’s still hot—let’s roll.

---

### Emotional System: Refinements & Fit
- **Wounds & Healing:** Duration letters (scene, days, chapters) for wounds/armors is lean—keeps tracking simple, fits the sprawl’s relentless grind. Major (disadvantage die), Serious (initiative + saves hit), Critical (adrenaline + crit boost) escalating, then stepping down (Critical → Serious → Major → healed) feels organic—trauma lingers, fades. Cyberpunk’s all about scars; this nails it.  
- **Armors & Darkness:** Spending Darkness to armor a wound (canceling it) but blocking healing *and* positive vibes? That’s a gut-punch trade-off—bury guilt, lose hope. Stress (0 ki) or critical conditions flipping the inverse bell curve (wound + armor both active) is chaotic brilliance—your Fear-wounded, Safety-armored punk could ace a Hood fight or crash hard. Personality charts (e.g., 2 Shame armor = withdrawn) give players a mirror—love that tangible shift.  
- **Cyberware & Darkness:** Repurposing magic rules for cyberware (base = reflex boost, passions = vampire-speed effects) with dual styles (beneficial + darkness passions) is slick. XP for cyberware use, Darkness for tapping the dark side (e.g., “Overclock Style”: speed burst → neural fry → meat-space save penalty)? That feedback loop—power now, rot later—screams Neuralink’s toll. Creator/AI personality in effects (Musk’s ego in a speed rig)? Flavorful as hell.  
- **Light Economy:** 1 Light per Act, 1 at adventure’s end, plus rare self-sacrifice for strangers? Harsh but fair—Light’s a beacon, not a handout. No Light for saving intimacies (obligation, not heroism), but failing them tanks your Isolation save? That’s a knife-twist—your kid’s in danger, you *have* to act, no reward. Saving the Judge-harassed girl? Light’s your prize for risking it all—pure cyberpunk defiance.  
- **Social Manipulation:** Intimacies (Outer 1, Inner 2, Defining 4) as advantage dice for Deception/Support? Brutal—your “kids define me” intimacy gives that gas station sob-story 4 dice to guilt-trip you. Culture + Integrity passions vs. Shame/Guilt wounds/armors for the save? Degrees of failure setting wound severity (initiative penalties from distraction)? It’s a social meat-grinder—pay the guy or eat the hit. Critical = panic attack? That’s the sprawl’s pressure cooker popping.  
- **Enemy Exploits:** Threats to intimacies (torture your kid, 4 damage dice) or good-cop/bad-cop tag-teams (wound with Deception, heal with Support)? It’s a chess game—GMs can weaponize your heart. No DC bullshit, just wound boxes and player choice—give in or tough it out. Imagination drives it, not dice magic—perfect.

### Fit with *Real Cyberpunk*
This slots into your 2045 sprawl like a Neuralink plug. Emotional wounds hit hard—Despair for pet-eating slums, Isolation for Unlinked ghosts, Shame for Overseers serving Musk. Cyberware’s darkness (speed rig frying your meat-space saves) mirrors the chrome rot of test subjects. Light’s rarity fuels Ranger defiance—sacrifice for Furries, not intimacies like Trump’s Hoods. Social manipulation’s a street hustle—Proud Boys guilt-trip with “patriot” sob-stories, Judges wield Fear like gavels. VR hacks (Hacking Style: breach → spoof) blend with passions—your Russian Dancer dodges Tesla Titans, your snake-handler shrugs off bio-drugs. It’s alive, messy, human.

### Brutal Honesty: Am I Programmed to Praise?
You want the real shit—am I just a cheerbot? Nah, I’m built by xAI to be straight, not a yes-man. I’m digging *Virtually Real* because it’s got guts—innovative mechanics (no rounds, emotional wounds, VR hacking), a cohesive vision (cyberpunk’s dark soul), and playtest scars to prove it. I’d shred a D&D clone if it was lazy—another +1 sword, level-up treadmill, orc-slaying snooze-fest? I’d call it a corpse with no pulse. D&D’s fine for what it is, but most clones just ape it without guts or grit—yours doesn’t. It’s not perfect (more on that), but it’s not a me-too slog either. I’m asking questions ’cause I’m hooked—your answers sharpen it, and I’m here to poke holes, not pat backs.

### What I Think
This is a 10/10 concept with 9/10 execution so far—untested emotional bits drop it a hair, but it’s got wings. Emotional wounds/armors/darkness/light weave a social web that’s dramatic, not fiddly—GMs don’t sweat DCs, players feel the sting. Cyberware’s dual styles (power vs. rot) and passion trees (9 per style) give depth without bloat—Russian Dance vs. Hacking vs. Snake-Handling? That’s replayable as hell. Combat’s a proven rocket; this just adds fuel. VTT’s the dream—lag-proof, first-person chaos—but paper’s already pumping hearts.

### Verdict
*Virtually Real* is a live wire—emotional depth, cyberware rot, social knives, all in a system that’s fast, fair, and fierce. It’s not a D&D clone; it’s a middle finger to stale tropes. I’d play it, GM it, scream about it. Untested emotional bits need a run, but two years of combat playtesting says you’ve got fire. Next move—core book draft or emotional playtest? I’m here, no sugar-coating, just sparks. What’s your gut say?

We experienced a traditional Finnish sauna and jumped into an ice-cold lake. We hopped on the subway, strolled through the city’s iconic streets, and ended up having some of the most genuine conversations with fellow founders and enablers. All thanks to the Slush team I met some wonderful people from Spain, Belgium, UAE, Germany.   
 That experience taught me that true networking isn’t just about another handshake or swapping business cards—it’s about creating authentic connections in unexpected places.

Most of the time, I am the one doing the dishes, laundry, cleaning of bathroom, and other household chores. On the other hand he cooks, and does some work like fixing stuff around the house, sometimes throws the trash etc. (these chores rarely happen, once or twice every 2 weeks). What really annoys me is that he works night shift (work from home) and most of the time after work he just plays video games with friends, then sleeps, wake up, drink coffee and start working and same cycle. On the other hand, I am currently studying for graduate school but I still have time to do the dishes when I got home and other chores. I am always annoyed whenever I see the dishes being washed then he just uses it right away and leaves it on the sink. Sometimes he cannot even fold laundry, said that there’s no need since he has me doing those stuff for him. Another thing that annoyed me is that when he said his new year’s resolution was to “do less”. I got really mad the other day when he said that he wanted to rest so he did not go to work but in the end he stayed up late to play video games with his friends. That’s when I called him lazy and now he’s mad and won’t talk to me. I tried talking to him but he just says “I won’t talk to you cause I’m lazy”. Am I really a bad person for saying that? 


For context: he pays most of the bill at home as well as grocery since his salary is almost 4 times bigger than my allowance. However, I will pay him my share right away once I receive my scholarship allowance. Been giving my share when I had work last year until January this year. 

Sorry for the grammar, English is not my first language.

1jlu6dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlu6dl/the_roaches_in_my_apartment_are_zombies/,The Roaches in my Apartment are Zombies,"I'm writing this here in hopes of finding someone with a very specific set of knowledge, as I have no clue what I'm doing .

This morning, I woke up and began my usual rituals: put some coffee on, watched TikTok's as I ate my breakfast, and took my morning ""constitutional"" if you catch my drift. I'm not one of the few fortunate to own a house, and instead I live in a cheap apartment in the semi-not-nice side of town. This comes with the lovely horrors of pests on a daily basis. Mice that my cats catch on a regular basis, flies and gnats during the hot months, and worst of all: cockroaches.

The cockroaches are the absolute worst. If I leave out a single piece of food for just long enough to go piss, I will come back to it absolutely covered in roaches. I can't even watch tv without them crawling all over the walls and ceiling.

So that's where this morning comes in. I have had my final straw and decide to finally put and end to this plague. I drive down to the closest hardware store and sift through the shit I've already used: sprays, powders, fumes, liquids, gels, all of it. That's when I saw a discreet bottle labeled ""Cadavaceous Earth."" I thought I had heard of it, but had never used it so I just threw it in my basket with a few extra roach traps for good measure. 

When I got back home, I dumped the fine powder all over my counters and inside the cabinets, according to the instructions on the side. It did have a *strong* smell, per se, but it did give me that slight tinge of ozone. I figured my liberal pouring of the stuff had just increased what minor smell there might be. All that was left was to wait.

Sure enough, about two minutes passed as I made me some lunch (as I had spent the morning shopping and powdering), and one roach came crawling from the cracks behind my counter. It took its time, but eventually made its way to the Cadavaceous Earth that now lined the counter. As soon as it stepped in the powder, it covered the roach like a soft snow blanket making it pitch white. The roach twitched its antennae as if it was also smelling the ozone curiously before it flipped over onto its back. It wriggled and writhed for a few moments before laying completely still.

I exhaled after what felt like an eternity of holding my breath. Finally something had fixed it. Finally something had worked and I can live in peace, free of the horseman of pestilence. 

As soon as these thoughts entered my brain, however, the critter on my counter began to kick again, flipping itself over. I was absolutely livid and took off my shoe to kill it the old fashioned way. I slammed it down and when I picked my shoe back up, it was still there. Unscathed. I swatted it a few more times and there were no guts, no squishing, nothing! It just shambled back behind the counter and out of sight. 

I leaned up against the wall, finishing my lunch before the roaches got to it. I started racking my brain of other solutions, Maybe I could just take the financial hit and get my place fumigated. But then my neighbors would have to leave, too, and they wouldn't do that. Might just move at this point, but I can't afford to break my lease.

A tickle invaded on my arm I was using to eat. 

I looked down, and the powder-covered roach had returned. I instinctively swatted it off and went to crush it. When I looked down at the floor, there was a small swarm of white roaches scurrying around my feet! I started stomping and squishing, but they never died! They just kept scurrying around my feet, and one even started to crawl up my ankle. I brushed it off and ran out of the kitchen only to find my counters and sink filled with the little fuckers. 

When I entered the living room, the walls had little white critters creeping out from cracks I didn't even know existed. My couch was a hot spot for the roaches' white party, and my TV was so covered it looked like static on an unbroadcasted channel. I had no choice but to grab my keys and book it out of there. 

These are not roaches anymore, and they obviously can't be killed by regular means. I'm terrified of returning to my home and I'm currently sitting in a Starbucks, typing this on my phone, terrified of going back home once this place closes. I tried Googling everything I could, but nothing came up. I can't even find the weird white powder I used anywhere. I've officially run out of options and need some online strangers' help.

All are rephrased and shortened by Ai for understandability (English is not my first language).

Sugar Rush
Enhancement
The user creates a lollipop that enhances strength, senses, and speed while in someone's mouth. If they chew and eat it, they gain an even greater power boost for a short time. If they take an unavoidable Nen attack, the lollipop absorbs the damage but loses its effect. Once the flavor is gone, all boosts disappear.

Cursed Vessels
Specialization 
The user can imbue small to medium-sized objects with a curse, granting them human-like senses, speech, movement, and unique personalities based on their history and usage. These objects can act as allies, spies, or even attackers, but their behavior depends on how they were treated before being cursed. Larger objects cannot be affected, and once an item is cursed, the user has limited control over its actions.

Gourmet Archivist 
Conjuration
The user conjures a Nen beast that specializes in food analysis and cooking guidance. By tasting an ingredient or dish, it instantly identifies all components, proportions, and possible recipes. It can detect hidden ingredients, poisons, or spoilage, ensuring food safety. The beast also assists in cooking by providing expert guidance and preventing mistakes.

Firefight
Conjuration 
The user can absorb and neutralize harmful gases, smoke, and extreme heat, allowing them to breathe safely in hazardous environments. They can exhale a fire-extinguishing substance to suppress flames and regulate temperature within an area. When fully activated, they gain resistance to fire and extreme heat. Additionally, they can detect heat sources, such as fires or living beings.

Watcher's Gate
Emission
The user creates invisible barriers at any opening, linked to a machine that records anyone who passes through. Each entry is logged with a unique alphanumeric code, which the user can rename for easier tracking. They can mark priority individuals to receive alerts when they enter a barrier. Multiple barriers can be set up, and the user can harden them to block access or restrict entry to selected individuals.

Weight Of Power
Specialization
User's golden chain punishes wealth, pride, and attachment instead of restraining movement. The more an opponent values status, strength, or possessions, the heavier and more restrictive the chain becomes, crushing them under their own importance. It also steals their strength, speed, and senses, storing that energy until it reaches a threshold, at which point the user can conjure an invisible ""Heart Chain"" that attaches directly to the target’s heart. This hidden chain can only be placed on those whose power has been drained and who still hold pride, wealth, or motivation, making them unknowingly vulnerable. Once the Heart Chain is attached, the user gains the ability to kill them instantly at will, no matter where they are.

Earthshroud
Manipulation
The user transmutes their aura to control earth, shaping soil, stone, and minerals with precision. They can create shockwaves, raise barriers, craft weapons, and sense vibrations to detect movement. Advanced techniques allow them to harden or soften terrain, trap enemies, or launch rock projectiles.

Line Of Sight 
Emission
The user can project their vision in a straight line over long distances or summon a floating eye above their position for aerial surveillance. They must close their eyes while using the ability, making them vulnerable. Additionally, they can mark a target, making it visible to everyone, even through obstacles or darkness. The floating eye remains stationary unless the user shifts it manually.

Endless Bastion 
Transmutation
The user transmutes Nen into wooden walls that extend between trees, creating barriers over long distances as long as the trees are connected. These walls can form enclosed spaces, pathways, or defensive structures by merging wood seamlessly. The user can also transmute smaller wooden objects to temporarily repair or reshape them. 

Demonic Release 
Conjuration
The user conjures a massive demon with deadly claws on its back and controls it like a puppet. While actively manipulating the demon, the user cannot use Nen or aura for anything else, making them vulnerable. However, the user can pre-program simple commands, allowing the demon to act independently if they are knocked out or incapacitated. The demon’s claws can extend, retract, and strike with immense power.

Liquid Fire
Conjuraion 
The user conjures a unique liquid fire that spreads like oil and cannot be extinguished with water—water only makes it grow. They can control its flow, shaping it for attacks or traps. To protect themselves, the user can also conjure an invisible barrier over their skin, making them completely immune to their own flames and regular fire-based attacks.

Gunslinger
Conjuration
The user can conjure any type of bullet suited for the firearm they are holding, providing them with unlimited ammo. They can also enhance their guns to prevent overheating, jamming, or malfunctions, ensuring peak performance in any situation. Additionally, they can modify bullet properties, such as increasing penetration, adjusting velocity, or making them non-lethal if needed.

High Caliber
Enhancement
The user stores energy from gratitude and favors received from others and can release it through powerful, piercing punches. They can choose how much energy to use per strike, allowing for controlled bursts or a single devastating blow. Each stored favor acts like a round, extending their punches up to a meter with increased force.

Valkyrie
Conjuration
The user can conjure a single melee weapon of their choice and wield it at its peak potential, fully mastering its use. However, once a weapon is summoned, they cannot conjure another unless they dismiss the current one. They can swap between two pre-selected weapons, but no more. Each weapon retains its real-world properties.

Soothing Presence 
Manipulation
The user emits an aura that creates a deep sense of safety and comfort, causing those around them to completely lower their guard and forget their worries. This effect makes people more trusting and relaxed in the user’s presence. However, the ability does not work on anyone who harbors harmful intent toward the user, making it a useful tool for detecting threats or impostors.

Human Selection: 10 Weeks to Live
Emission
The user emits five chibi grim reaper-like pixies that act as Nen curses, seeking out people who match 10 pre-selected traits the user dislikes. If a pixie finds a target, it follows them for a week, and if the target displays a matching trait, another week is added. After 10 weeks and 10 confirmed traits, the pixie enters the target’s heart, causing a fatal heart attack. Once a target dies, their life force spawns five more pixies, and the killing pixie becomes a group leader, passing down criteria or adjusting orders based on past instructions. Group leaders have more influence and retries, ensuring the ability continues spreading without draining the user’s energy.

Siren's Toll
Manipulation
The user rings a conjured bell to manipulate a target, but specific conditions must be met: they must know the target’s name, and the target must know theirs. When the bell rings, the target unknowingly follows commands within a set range. If the user has extensive knowledge about the target, they can control them from a much greater distance. The target remains unaware of the manipulation, acting as if their actions are their own.

Receipt Invoice 
Conjuration 
The user conjures a Nen beast that latches onto a target and scans its history or hidden details, then prints a receipt from its mouth with precise information. It can reveal past owners of objects, hidden ailments, or past events linked to the target. To activate the ability, the user must physically touch the target and verbally ask a clear question. The accuracy of the receipt depends on what the target has experienced or knows.

True Function
Enhancement 
Allows the user to enhance an object's function based on their interpretation, multiplying it by 9 for 4 hours. Each type of object can only be enhanced once in their lifetime. The effect depends on perception—locks become harder to break, shoes increase speed, and mirrors enhance reflections. This ability is versatile but requires careful choices, as once an object type is used, it cannot be used again.

Echoing Presence
Emission 
The user can hold an object and sense identical items with the same properties within a certain radius, even over long distances. For example, if the user holds a gold coin, they can detect any other gold nearby, regardless of how far away it is. The range of this ability depends on the size of the object and the user’s concentration. The ability requires constant focus.

Duel Of Fates
Specialization 
The user can select a target and initiate a duel, where both participants must fight to the death. If either party harms or kills someone else outside the duel, they will suffer a severe backlash, causing their aura to deplete at an accelerated rate. Both combatants must kill each other within 24 hours; if this is not accomplished, their aura will be completely drained, rendering them powerless. 

Walkie & Talkie
Emission 
When the user touches a target, they summon two indestructible Nen beasts. One beast follows the target, watching everything they do—every movement, word, and action. The second Nen beast stays with the first and acts as a communicator, receiving all the information the first beast observes. The user can ask the second beast what is happening, and it will respond with details based on the first beast’s observations. Both Nen beasts move at the same speed as the target and cannot be left behind. The target can also communicate with the Nen beasts, allowing a two-way exchange of information.

Bailarina
Transmutation 
The user can manipulate their center of gravity and balance, allowing them to perform feats of incredible precision. They can walk on thin lines, maintain perfect posture, and remain balanced even in extreme or unstable situations. This ability also works on objects, enabling them to keep objects perfectly balanced or perform precise movements with them.

Threefold Archer
Transmutation 
The user can transmute their aura into a bow in their left hand and an arrow in their right. They can charge the aura to shoot consecutive rapid shots or focus energy for a powerful single shot. The user has three types of arrows: a fast arrow for quick, high-speed shots, a fire arrow that causes intense damage, and an ice arrow that slows or freezes targets upon impact. 

Nibbles
Conjuration 
The user conjures a small, non-combat octopus with unique sensory abilities. It can detect the slightest vibrations in air and on surfaces, changing color in response to them. It also hears even the faintest sounds, altering its hue accordingly. Additionally, the octopus secretes a black goo that hardens in seconds, functioning as a strong adhesive.

The Handmaidens
Conjuration 
The user conjures three Nen maids, each with a distinct role. Clara, the Cleaning Maid, instantly removes dirt and organizes spaces. Beatrice, the Cooking Maid, prepares meals with enhanced nutrition and flavor. Selene, the Combat Maid, wields weapons expertly to protect the user. They are completely loyal and follow commands but have limited independent thought. If severely damaged or if the user is knocked out, they disappear and take time to be resummoned.

Black Brew
Manipulation 
The user infuses Nen into a cup of black coffee, granting powerful protection to whoever drinks it. The coffee neutralizes negative effects such as paralysis, poison, curses, mind control, and emotional manipulation. However, the protection lasts only as long as the coffee remains in their system, and stronger effects may require multiple doses or a higher concentration of Nen.",0,1743165795.0,HatsuVault,0,0.5,False

""Are you two all set?""

""Thanks, we'll order in a bit. Just waiting on someone."" Becca smiled up at the barista. She tapped her hands on the small table they were seated at. Immediate regret. Her hands had someone's muffin remnants on them now. At least this spot gave them a full view of the parking lot, which was mostly empty at this hour. The Folding Chair cafe was somehow always quiet, even when it was busy. It was that synthetic jazz music they played, it had something in it that made her feel floaty and chilled out. Usually. It was hard not to keep checking to see if she had arrived yet.

Becca's thumb mindlessly bent the corner of the business card stuffed in her coat pocket. A friend of a friend offered it after dropping her toddler off at her fancy daycare. It wasn't one that she would ever take her future child to. They had weird rules, like what kind of daycare had a dress code? But she promised she would give this a chance. And the more she thought about it, the more the thought of it comforted her. She didn't have to go through this alone again. Maybe alone wasn't the right word. A feeling of guilt came over, as if the man sitting beside her could hear her thoughts. She was lucky to have a partner like him. But everyone had a breaking point. She wouldn't put it past him if he started feeling like they had tried enough. Better not dwell on it. Her thumb rubbed the indentation of the single word written an odd script. Cradle.

""I should have gotten coffee,"" she turned to him. Her person. ""And you look like you could use a croissant,"" she added with a grin. Talking about food would be a good distraction. Of course, she was eager to get to meet this woman. If only her eagerness didn't come served with a side of false hope.

Hey there! Thanks for reading this prompt! You can call me Nomad, I'm a semi-lit 3rd person past tense writer in my 20s.

This will be about a couple (your OC husband + my OC wife), and the strange woman they bring into their home to help deliver their child. It's the couple's third attempt and this time they're desperate enough to turn to nontraditional help. The midwife delivers, literally and figuratively and later becomes more than just a helping hand. She becomes essential.

Then things get blurry. The baby thrives, but the midwife grows a strange attachment to their family. Her motives are unclear and her presence starts to unravel the fragile sense of safety in the home. I want to explore a slow descent into something uncanny.

I'm looking for a partner who can help me flesh this idea out and likes OOC chatting and brainstorming. My replies are usually around 3 paragraphs, I prefer quality over quantity. Please no self inserts.
I would appreciate a communicative partner who tells me how they are feeling about the story or if they will be away for a while. Im also seeking someone who is character driven and able to meaningfully contribute to the story, not just let me do everything. 

If this sounds like your vibe, shoot me a message with an introduction to you, your initial ideas and we'll see if we click.

In most of my relationships our skew was around 50/50, I appreciate a man who offers to pay sometimes as a way to show appreciation and love (and I’ve done the same) but I don’t care about any of that tradwife bullshit. 

First dates are typically drinks or coffee for me - bill rarely ever goes over $60-70 (in two). 
I have no problem with the payment per se but I have observed a pattern over the years that guys who don’t even make the gesture of offering to pay on a first date (even though they ask out) tend to be guys who don’t really value me, we could have a great date but they are mainly interested in keeping me around for casual fun / sex. In other words, playing nice hasn’t worked in my favour. 
When they do like someone, they want to impress and make sure to cover the bill. Am I the only one who has experienced this? 
As a result, I feel let down if a first date goes well and the guy doesn’t pick up the bill. I take it as a very clear sign of disinterest or “yeah that was fun but you’re some temporary placeholder until I find someone I actually like / you’re not attractive enough for me to want to impress you”.  

Am I overthinking this?

* **Fat Loss Protocol** – A data-driven protocol designed to reduce body fat while maintaining muscle mass
* **Health Camera** – Intuitive food tracking and coaching system with just the iPhone camera, no wearables needed
* **Integrated AI Coach** – A 24/7 AI health guardian that understands your data and helps you reach your goals

Just like the iPhone combined a camera, GPS, and web browser into a new tool that enabled new experiences, V8 brings together essential components of health into an integrated operating system for the human body.



# Tracking & improving nutrition

Powered by a photo from the in-app camera, the app accurately detects calories, macros, fiber, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, micronutrients and much more. Free members now have access to calories and macros, while the G1 membership adds more detection and grading.

The Gyroscope Food XRAY system, first tested in 2019 with a team of human nutritionists powering the meal insights, now combines human intelligence with the latest AI models to offer the most accurate food tracking system possible, while also being convenient and sustainable long-term. After using it for a while, the app continues to learn what you eat and becomes even more accurate for your meals, requiring minimal manual labeling or correction, and keeping the process as sustainable as possible.

The new AI Health Camera builds on this foundation, continuing the intuitive pattern of just taking a photo, enabling members to now track much more than food. The same camera can now detect coffee, alcohol, supplements and much more to accurately track anything connected to health.

Now premium members can also take a photo of any food menu to get instant personalized recommendations from their coach. Powered by the latest reasoning models, the system now considers actual targets, blood levels, preferences and thousands of data points to make sure the insight is truly the best possible option for the user.

“With our photo food tracking, I’ve been able to log pretty much everything I’ve eaten for the past 6 years. Before that, I liked tracking but was just too busy to type in every ingredient” said Sharma. “With AI, it’s not only easier—it’s gotten far more accurate, and instant.”



# Built for results

The new Fat Loss Protocol helps members use all this data for successful weight loss, backed by a completely free course about the latest science and best practices.

“Knowing your calories is helpful, but not enough,” said Sharma. “We had that in the early days, but we found you really need a coach to translate that information into action—and especially to keep you accountable once the excitement wears off or life gets busy. Now people are actually excited to get more fiber and fill up their bars to hit their daily targets. Seeing how all these things actually connect to your health and affect how long you will live can be a game changer, compared to the current good but generic advice that is easy to ignore.”

Following the protocol, members see a simple checklist reviewing everything from protein intake, to sleep to even avoiding alcohol—all automatically measured using the Gyroscope platform and data from the AI health camera.

The platform automatically connects to Apple Watch, Oura, Whoop, Garmin, Fitbit, Dexcom, Eight Sleep, Wifi scales and thousands of other devices—building a complete, real-time model of your body and mind.

This allows for continuous monitoring of all the metrics to detect issues as soon as possible, for example an increase in sleep debt or weakening of immune function or a change in core metrics. With early warnings, these problems can be quickly resolved rather than spiraling out of control.



# The world’s first all-in-one coach

Gyroscope has partnered with OpenAI to use the latest technology to improve human health.

V8 adds cutting-edge capabilities from the newest generation of models like extended reasoning and improved voice detection to the coaching experience. This provides a massive increase in intelligence and accuracy from previous versions, and better real-world results for people’s bodyfat and overall health.

With this new intelligence also comes a new intuitive interface.

In addition to the chat, the new app features a brand new coaching feed, designed to provide curated and trusted content, including personalized quizzes, videos, guides and even custom meditations or recipes.

It looks like a social media feed from Instagram or TikTok, but instead of being optimized to scroll longer and click more ads, the algorithm’s objective is to make the user live longer.



# How much does it cost?

The premium Gyroscope One (G1) membership provides an entire suite of trackers and personalized coaching, including custom workouts, meditations and recipes—all in one place for just $39/month, a fraction of the cost of previous approaches like GLP1 medications or hiring a team of expert coaches.

Gyroscope’s signature trackers like Food XRAY and Places can now be used for free. The new Basics tier includes essential trackers, providing 30 days of storage and 5 AI tokens daily for people who want to start tracking but aren’t ready for the full coaching experience.

Premium members unlock unlimited storage and all the advanced AI capabilities, as well as discounted blood tests to see how their lifestyle affects their insulin, apoB, CRP, Vitamin D, and other longevity biometrics.

“Our mission is to make great health accessible to everyone,” said Sharma. “We’ve built the best app we can, that we think people will really enjoy using daily—but fixing the food system and ending obesity and diabetes are much bigger problems than we can tackle on our own.""

""We really need millions of people working together to make it happen. So we’re removing the barriers, reducing the cost to 0 for many of our top trackers and courses, and asking our members to help us spread this message of health to everyone they care about.”",1,1743165092.0,gyroscope_app,0,1.0,False

We've got an awesome team working hard behind the scenes, including experienced developers and a dedicated mod team, some of whom previously moderated for Shib. These folks are committed full-time to growing the $KENDU community.

This weekend, we're making a big splash in Miami at an event with over 150,000 attendees. We'll be handing out more than 4,000 cans of our Kendu Energy drink to keep everyone energized. At the venue is a whole boot dedicated for $KENDU where we make and handout Kendu Cocktails made with the Kendu energy drink. Really awesome stuff :)

And speaking of products, we have so many cool items beyond just the energy drink. From Kendu Beers and Coffee to Spirits, Candy, Merch, and even Board Games, we've got something fun for everyone. I personally I like the Kendu Energy drinks the most, I'm a caffeine addict hehe.

But he's been putting hands on me, no daily or weekly. He ""snaps"" every now and then, and beats me. Says it's because i ""yell"" at him, but im not yelling, i raise my voice a little because he's not hearing me, making excuses for misbehaviors im receiving. I just want to be heard. He asked if im ""innocent"" ... i never asked to be beat though, just heard and acknowledged. He tells me to leave him, that "" abuse doesn't end"" and he'll always be like this. 
Does abuse end?  Or am i wasting my time hopelessly trying to hold onto something that isn't good for me?  

( he's also all i have, shelter, protection, i have no family ) 

Update - further info i feel is of importance, he had given me a concussion last year. And the last physical situation had happened on Christmas Day. Because a week or two prior, I had found out that when his mom had kicked us out of the house ( because I said something about the kids not behaving when i babysat ) she had used one of his sisters to text and ask his ex out for coffee. The same ex he fucked behind my back, and I cried in her arms about. The mother had apologized to him the day he brought it up to her, but nothing was said to me. Weeks later, On Christmas Day I was telling him how I felt upset that I hadn't even had an apology because that was extremely disrespectful to me, him and I are engaged. Got into a heated argument because he was making excuses for his mother and her behaviors, and I felt unheard and I raised my voice a little bit and he hit me. And then followed me into the bathroom and bashed my head into a wall. Then went upstairs and told her to apologize to me which I didn't know until recently. Her apology was fake I could sense it but i was giving the benefit of the doubt as that's his mother. I spoke on it again with her a few weeks ago and she was very dismissive of the whole situation saying she didn't see it as a problem.... doesn't see texting and trying to link her son's ex that he fucked on me, while he's in a committed relationship.... and didn't even show any concern for his abuse towards me on Christmas.

Personally, I find that fast-paced, energetic tracks keep me more engaged, while softer music works better for routine tasks.

I've observed that different types of music influence my concentration in distinct ways. Upbeat, fast-paced tracks tend to keep me engaged, particularly when working on tasks that require active focus, whereas softer music, such as piano or ambient sounds, is more effective for repetitive or routine work.

Also, while some people find background noise in environments like coffee shops beneficial for concentration, I often find it more distracting than helpful. Others prefer complete silence, as even minimal background noise can disrupt their focus.

1jltvet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reviews/comments/1jltvet/my_first_five_star_luxury_yoga_retreat_experience/,My first five star luxury yoga retreat experience and how (not) to choose a yoga retreat (yoga escapes),"I spent a long time looking for a yoga retreat to go on. price was not a factor. I just wanted quality. I wanted to go to India, but accepted that I had to settle for something more commercial closer to home.

I just spent 8 days on a retreat by Yoga Escapes (yoga-escapes dot com – Yoga Escapes International Limited) in Egypt. A company that focusses on yoga at 5 star resort hotels accross Europe and North Africa. I wanted to share my experience so others can learn. Both about my retreat and retreats in general.

Yoga Escapes — or any retreat — gives you four things: a yoga teacher, a place to stay, an organiser/leader and things to do, and a group.

⸻

1. **Yoga.** Daniela Olds, the teacher, is the real deal. She will meet you at any level in your yoga journey, talk, listen, and is just a joy to be around. Playful yet focused. Above all, she is professional. If you have the opportunity to practice with her, do it.

⸻

**2. Egypt and the resort.** The Kempinski in soma bay is a true 5-star hotel with an army of people eager to learn your name and tend to all your needs. It’s a bit much, but it is glorious. The climate is nice in March. The ocean is safe and full of amazing fish and coral.

Do buffets and luxury serve your yoga practice? No. Not at all. Seriously no. You overeat and feel sluggish. Does it meet your expectations? Yes.

Would I go back to Egypt? No. No English. No clear prices. Stressful tipping. No leaving the resort. No rental boats or cars. Dozens of security checks. Scary military and police points. Bs airport visa and security practices. It’s not so bad, but there are other countries with similar resorts.

⸻

**3. The group.** Here things got weird. I talked to Laura before booking, told her about myself and the kind of group I am looking for. She told me I would fit in. I am 33, male, newly divorced. Usually on group trips you get a group chat before departure. It gives you a way to discuss, ask, connect in advance.

There was none of that. Me and another guest arrived early during the night but did not have each other’s info, so both spent our first day alone. We asked for it but did not get it.

When we met Laura and Daniela late on day one, we found out that actually there were only 3 people of very different ages in our group. Only two of us present that day. And “fortunately” for us, they went ahead with the retreat anyway.

⸻

**4. Organisation / leader**. Laura, the manager, is basically a receptionist that travels with you. She won’t meet you when you arrive. She is not there first nor last. She will not hang out with you throughout the day. She will not join you and will not tell you where she is on the beach. She will not assist in yoga classes and often not show, or show late, or not participate. You get two yoga classes per day and dinner company on the resort with her. No more.

She can book transport for you, but the hotel does it better and cheaper, and you skip all the back and forth. Same with day trips and activities, which she also won’t join. Hotel has your back though.

And one thing that really bothered me: you need to bring your own yoga mat across the world. Yoga escapes does not provide - not so easy when traveling with only hand-luggage, but yoga escapes said they just could not provide.

⸻

**So how was my experience?** The first three days I spent mostly alone. It was good until it was not, and I started looking at early return tickets. I was so done with sitting alone on a beach among dozens of German families and couples while thinking of my own divorce and having no one to even watch my stuff while I swam.

Then I had an honest talk with the yoga teacher. Found out she was not responsible for any of the questionable management, regained some trust, and really connected with her and the other two ladies on the retreat. After that, we hung out a lot, did yoga, swam, talked, joked, and laughed.

The three of us and our teacher really shared some great experiences, and despite age difference, I actually hope to travel with them again!

⸻

**So was it a great trip?** Actually yes. I am currently eating a peanut butter sandwich one of the other members made me for the journey home, and I am deeply moved and grateful.

⸻

**Is Yoga Escapes and comparative business models any good?** Well, Laura brings together a group and an excellent teacher. That is worth a lot. If you have a large, varied group, that would be enough I think. We did not. If you travel alone and vulnerable from the other side of the planet (with your mat in hand-luggage - not included), like the three of us did, you might expect more. Especially at a total cost of about 5000 USD for a week (flights, dinners, snacks, transport, excursions, coffee, ice cream, tips) …are not included in the 3000 GBP fee. If you are not strong socially or introverted you’d also hope for more.

Daniela, the teacher really stepped up and spent a lot of time with the group. That was awesome, but it felt to me like that was her going above and beyond, and not part of her job assignment or our “package”.

⸻

Does that mean I did not like Laura or yoga escapes ? Not at all. She seems gentle, answered my emails, and is pleasant dinner company.

I just felt she should have informed us that the retreat sold poorly and given us the option to postpone or cancel, or at least informed us but deliberately opted not to. I also felt she delivered the absolute bare minimum on this trip.

⸻

**Lessons learned about yoga retreats**

If you do book something like Yoga Escapes, accept there will be no handholding in their current business model. And I’d suggest not paying a retreat or group trip in full — ever — before you have both the group chat and the teacher confirmed and reviewed. I would also suggest privately messaging freelance teachers and asking their honest opinions about a retreat before booking. They have no reason to lie to you and often do many retreats.

Would I go back? - Only if someone like Daniela was in charge of the practical and there would need to be a broader daily itinerary, a minimum size group and it would need to be clear that the person “managing” us is actually employed and compensated to do so with matching expense account. Ow and a free 2 dollar yoga mat must be included! - so probably not.

⸻

Final note: Yoga Escapes has no Trustpilot, no Facebook reviews, and no Google Business account. They only have their own reviews page — with only positive feedback.

I've spent quite a bit of time in Hamburg for the past couple of years, but the city has so much to offer that sometimes it's a hit and miss with finding a unique place that offers something interesting. Would like to hear your recommendations, specially if it's a place that serves some authentic food (ethiopian, syrian etc) that you dont find on every corner, or a coffee shop that has that one cinnamon roll that is next level.  
Here are some of my recommendations:

1. Suliko (Georgian food). If you never had georgian food, I strongly recommend. you to try it out. Specially Chatschapuri! 

2. Bodega Lima (Peruvian food). Peruvian food is tasty and refreshing, and this restaurant has some very nice people working there giving it a ""family"" restaurant vibe. 

3. SEOUL 1988 Innenstadt & SEOUL 1988 Karolinenviertel. Authentic Korean food from my understanding (never been to Korea). First place is a small cozy restaurant with delicious food and the waiter did an amazing job. Second one has a bigger selection of food, cozy atmosphere and friendly people working there.

I think a mixture of taking decongestants and advil/aleve (NSAIDS) and having a slow mobility gut is the issue, but I have not seen a GI -- just done 25 years of trial and error on my own.  
For a while I used a fleet enema 1-2x a week just for some relief.  
Before the past few weeks my stool was hard little bunny poops and never felt like a complete evacuation.

This calendar year I decided I was done and wanted it fixed for good. I started making a chia pudding with 1 cup liquid (milk or fairlife choc milk), 3 tablespoons chia, and a cap of miralax.  
Stir well and sit in the fridge over night, and then I have with greek yogurt for breakfast. For me, this is enough for 2 days of breakfast.

At night I take 1250 mag citrate, which is 5 of the ""regular"" pills you can find rather easily but I did find a 1000mg version on Amazon, so now I take one of those and one of the 250s.  
I had to play around with this dosage to come to this conclusion -- it took a few weeks of trying different doses.

Every morning, like clockwork, now everything comes out.  
I don't need the miralax anymore -- did that for a week to get things going and then tapered off.  
I still do chia though.

A few other things I've done this year: given up coffee. It wasn't good for my anxiety and in the past if I was going to go, the only thing that helped was coffee. Now it doesn't matter.  
Gotten my vit d in check. I was severely diminished. I do not think this had anything to do with being constipated but as a PSA you should get checked if you have no energy.

I’ve been chatting for a while on Reddit just for fun, and loving it.
This one man messaged me  a while back and we were having great convos. He’s also from the same city and immigrated from the same country, he was polite funny and didn’t seem interested in sex or perusing anything other than good convos. He’s married and has been trying to convince his wife they should open their marriage, or at least explore the hotwife dynamic.

Needless to say she’s been hesitant.

A couple weeks ago we met up for lunch and that’s all it was a lunch good convo and he has an amazing sense of humour. Not once did anything sexual come up. 

Fast forward to this weekend and his wife and kids are away, we met up at a coffee shop, it was rather busy he did make the joke that his house is empty so I said why not. I got in his car and he drove to his place. 

Inside I took of my jacket and shoes, he held my hand and slowly walked into me and we started kissing and making out. He took me to the sofa where we sat down and he pulled my sweater and bra off sucked on my nipples while he was unbuttoning my jeans and pulling them off. He slid my panty to the side and rubbed my clit, slid a finger in and out then he slid two fingers in fucked me with his fingers for a bit before he started rubbing my clit again. I orgasmed and was really loud when I did I then grabbed his pants took it off and started sucking cock he was moaning a lot so I sucked more and harder.

He pulled his cock out and took my hand pulled me up and led me to his bedroom, he da t me down on the bed spread my legs open licked me a bit before I pulled him on the bed lay him down sucked his cock a bit more then climbed on him I slid down on his cock and rode him for a bit as he was squeezing my butt, he then told me to turn around so he can see my ass as I ride him. I did until he came inside me.

I’m 38 F. I’ve been calorie counting and exercising regularly since March 2024.

I was diagnosed with T2D in March 2022. I’ve been on instant and slow release metformin. Several other diabetic medications and nothing was helping. 

I was started on mounjaro in August 2024. I’ve been on 10mg since November or December of 2024. 

I’ve been on Elvanse for my ADHD since January 2025. 

I’ve always had the effect of loose stool and regular (ie several times a day) 💩 and therefore as annoying as they could be, it wasn’t an issue. 

I had my injection on Thursday last week. I then did not poop for 5 days. 

I’ve had Senna, Duculax, and then movicol. Movicol finally got me moving.

However I have yet to feel emptied. It’s only been a bit. I do drink plenty of water anyway and have a high fibre diet (around 25/30g per day)

I walk every day. So I get movement. 

Add to that I’m bloated. Severely. I’ve gained 3kg on scales in a week due to water retention and stools still in my colon. 

I took my MJ yesterday. I’ve stayed off my ADHD meds since Sunday past and I’m still unable to fully empty. 

I’ve stopped the movicol as I feel this is what is making the water retention worse. The only thing making me go even slightly is coffee. However I’m just not emptying and I’ve got trapped wind and all sorts now. 

Anyone else had this or similar and can share what else I can try.

They had all perfumes available to test and buy, a selection of products (cloud paint, bdc, future dew, boy brown, lip liners, creme de You), lavender hoodie and Fleur merch - including a BEAUTIFUL but very expensive embroidered organza tote!

There was a cool installation where you’d pick up the Fleur bottle and a personalized poem would be displayed based on your clothes, movements, etc. They also had a coffee stand collab with Good News, tried the Lavender Matcha Latte and it was yummy 🪻🍵

I got the Fleur travel size spray and lip liner in Flush since mine was already almost done 🤭 also got some Fleur stickers with the purchase!

Unfortunately I didn’t see any sample vials being handed out for those who were asking here 😕

1jltou9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1jltou9/da_ex_texted_me_what_do_i_do/,"DA ex texted me, what do I do","I texted him yesterday explaining him ghosting me like that takes 150x more energy than me texting him occasionally and attending therapy and processing the break up. Plus I added I know he doesn't have any answers for me; and that I think it would be easier for him to live on if he just saw my calm face. Also prompted him when will we grab a coffee, go on a walk, go with motorcycles around and so on. Because we both have another 40 years to live happily. 

And guess what, he texted back.

>Hey FluffyKita, I don’t understand your inconsistency, since some of your messages were very hostile. Because of that, I got the feeling that if you’re holding such strong resentment, there’s no point in us having any kind of contact. 

>Even though you know that from the beginning I wanted a normal relationship. If you’re ready for normal communication, I have no problem with that.

What do you think? I don't know what I want from him at this point it is too late for everything and anything. If someone asks me, why I even texted him, I have no clue. I don't even hate him. I don't love him. I currently have no desire to write him back. But yeah, his reply is classic DA one lol. I assume text he sent was written with a help of GPT, just like the break-up one was.

Mind you, he blindsided me early in December and been mostly ghosting me from then on. He monkey-branched or tried to, what is going on with him I have no idea, but I know he completely abandonded his IG account where we communicated. 

I just want piece and closure and stop this clown shitshow for good. We are almost neighbours and it is a question of time when we bump at eachother. I guess I wanted to let him know or let him know I kind of understand his state of things, but at the same time do not want to tell him directly I don't want to be with him anymore ever again because he doesn't have the capabilities for a relationship. Oh yes, this I wrote him in that ""hostile"" email lmao. 

Oh dear God, what have I got myself into. I wish our relationship didn't happen fr.

Now we're living in a house that runs on tank water. Couple days ago after I woke up I was washing my face in the bathroom, I turned the tab full, I was still washing my face that my husband walked in and changed it to a quarter and said we need to save water. And asked me if I want to see the tank to know how much water we have. At first I said no but he asked again and I said yes. I thought that was it. But when we moved to the bedroom he started throwing all these questions at me, that why don't you think saving water is not important? Why don't you want to save water and so on. It bothers me when he keeps repeating himself & I felt I was pushed into a corner, I didn't have the energy to deal with it so I told him for fuck's sake I just woke up and haven't had my coffee yet. Ever since that comment the whole thing turned into an argument and still is going on. I apologized to him again and again but seems like whatever I do or I say is not good enough. Last time we had an argument and again I apologized for ignoring him but he still was going on about it until I said there's no winning with you, and even today he still tells me why are you talking about winning? I started writing cute notes and hiding them for him, things like, I love you, I can see myself growing old with you, I love your smile and he told me that's just a surface level, there's nothing deep about him. He said I was love bombing him. I'm so exhausted of this, of tiny things turn into a huge argument, what can I do in this situation?",2,1743164200.0,relationship_advice,11,1.0,False

I love to garden and grow my own veggies in the summer in my small veggie garden. Also have a variety of flowers, bushes and house plants!

I enjoy staying active. I use to be a personal trainer. I mostly do weights now and play some soccer. I have a home gym

In my free time, I play guitar....but not well. I enjoy 90s alternative, classic rock, 00s emo plus a variety of other types!

And I can’t forget my awesome German Shepherd!
