1gjhyw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gjhyw2/double_date/,Double Date,"""Top off?"" I asked the man in the corner, already pouring more coffee before he could respond.

His hat was pulled down low, barely a nod in reply. I've worked here long enough to not ask more. 

I walked back and slid the pot back under the counter, then glanced over to the booth by the window. Dave and Kevin sat with their wives, Mary and Lila, raising hell like it was their job, each old story louder than the last.

Kevin, practically waving his fork around like a weapon, had 'em all caught up in one of his tales. ""So, Dave here decides he’s gonna play Tarzan on that old rope, the dumbass sack-o'-bricks belly smacks into the lake!""

Dave just snorted and pitched a crumpled sugar packet at him, smirking. “Hell, you’re the one who dared me to, man! Besides, you damn near drowned your ass rolling off that log!”

“Oh, give me a break,” Lila chimed in, sharp as a knife. ""Let’s not forget the time Kevin tried to heat up canned beans without opening the damn can. Had beans splattered all over the campsite like a bomb went off.”

They all broke out laughing, Dave slapping the table. 

Then Kevin slowed his chuckling, leaned forward, his face turning serious. ""Hey, Dave… you remember that drive we took out by Grand Ridge?""

Dave gave one final slap on the table.

Kevin kept going, the beers making his whisper louder than he thought. ""Out by that old church road? It was way late, and there was no one else around. And that… thing we saw up above the trees?""

I wiped the counter, my eyes moving from the man in the corner to glance at Dave, whose poker face was failing him.

Kevin pressed on,  ""It was this huge black triangle, lights on each point, just hovering there. No stars, no sound, just… there. And then it felt like… like I wasn’t in the car anymore. Like everything went… foggy, y’know? Next thing, I’m back in the seat. It was two when we saw it. I look at the clock—suddenly it’s past four. Just like that. Whole two hours gone.""

Dave opened his mouth, but what came out wasn’t words.

A godawful scream. A cry, almost infantile.

After thirty seconds straight, his vocal cords shredded. Specks of blood sprayed from his mouth, splattering across Mary, who was clearly in shock. 

I kept wiping down the counter, while the rest of the place emptied in a heartbeat. Folks bolted, even Kevin, Mary and Lila, eyes wide with the kind of fear you don’t shake off easy.

The man in the corner drained his cup, set it down with a soft clink, and gave the table a measured double tap with his knuckles.

My hand came down twice on the counter in reply, confirming my suspicions that the man in the corner *wasn't* the marked **unknown variable**.",1,1730736628.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

**Note that the 18% gratuity language has been removed**.

The property I'm currently at seems to believe that the choice of 'entree or buffet' belongs to the hotel, not the guest. Globalist breakfast here is ONLY the buffet ($19), and worse, the gratuity is ONLY $2.25.

Of course, I only found this out after we had entrees, but luckily before I had written ""Globalist"" in the tip line.

We've been together a year and a half by now. We both have female and male friends, perhaps he has more female friends, but that was okay with me. 

Last december he revealed that one of his friends (let's call her Amy, 24f) that he knows from university, maybe has feelings for him. 

This girl probably has Asperger's disease (we don't know it for sure but she is showing the signs) so sometimes it is really hard for my boyfriend to perfectly understand Amy's intentions, tones and the meaning of her sentences. Of course we respect her condition and don't blame her at all. But last december my bf mentioned that when they were in a Vienna trip with his mom, and 2 of his female friends (Amy and another friend), Amy showed weird signs: touching his arm more, touching both of his shoulders and a hug from backwards. 
He felt really uncomfortable with these and told me that I shouldn't worry about this because he got this under control and our relationship is more important to him than any relationship with friends. 

They have been in touch since then, but they didn't have meetups frequently. They have known each other since 2021 and have been in the same friend group since then. 

This autumn, they started meeting regularly for coffee. For example, in his break between 10.30 and 12.00, having coffee somewhere near the university they attend. But they sometimes have coffee after lessons, and these meetings became twice-a-week kinda regular. I feel so weird about this. 

He is not hiding these ""coffee dates"" but never mentions them unless I ask what is on his agenda for e. g. that particular day.

What do you think about this situation? Do you think between two people with this backstory can be anything more than friendship?

1gjht2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gjht2a/time_looped_chapter_14/,Time Looped (Chapter 14),"Sebastian June was perfect for the role of school counselor. One look alone portrayed strength, care, understanding, and professionalism… or so Will had been told. He himself had only gone to see the man twice per year, as the principal demanded of every student. So far, the obligatory chats had been a complete waste of time. The general questions were basic and trivial, revolving in equal part around what the boy thought about his future, and issues he’d felt in his past. On one occasion he’d tried to go off script in an effort to make it difficult for the counselor, but Mister June had had ample experience dealing with Alex and others like him to take it in stride.

*Get ready.* A text popped up on his phone. *He’s on his way.*

Responding with a thumbs up reaction, Will set the phone to vibrate and put it away.

“Good luck at the shrink,” a group of seniors laughed as they passed by.

Will did his best not to pay attention. Normally, he would be in the small waiting room in front of the counselor’s office. The issue with that was since Mister June was the only person who had the key. Until he arrived, people had no choice but to stand in the corridor, becoming the target of everyone’s ridicule.

Given a choice, the boy would have popped in ten minutes later, especially since Helen was adamant that the first student to see him wouldn’t arrive until the start of next period. However, anyone would agree that standing there waiting gave off a sense of urgency.

“Err, Mister…?” the counselor asked as he approached his office.

“Stone,” Will said. “William Stone.”

“William Stone.” The man nodded with a smile, almost suggesting that he remembered who that was. “I take it you’re here to see me?”

“Yes. I tried earlier this morning, but it was locked.”

“Right, right. I had some traffic trouble. Well, let me just get a quick coffee and I’ll be right with you.”

“It’s about Danny… we were in the same class, so… I just didn’t know who to talk to.”

The counselor’s expression instantly changed. The smile was still there, but the corners of the mouth turned slightly down, suggesting that he wasn’t particularly happy to skip his morning—or mid-morning at this point—coffee, but knew where his duty lay.

“We better go inside.” He unlocked the door.

The waiting section was little more than a set of chairs in front of the office’s main door. They were marginally more comfortable than those in class. Switching keys, the counselor opened the inner door and invited Will inside.

“And what made you come to me?” he asked, putting his suit jacket on the only hanger in the room. While most schools prided themselves with the elegant casual look, the vice-principal had instead insisted that certain people of Enigma High had to “match their role.” Mister June was one of those select few.

“They’ve been repeating it all week since Danny’s death,” the boy replied.

“Right, right. Good choice. Good choice.”

*Don’t look around,* the boy told himself*. Don’t look around.*

Inadvertently, he did just that. Ignoring the plainness of the room, there were several large filing cabinets, most of them lockable. Above and around them were framed inspirational posters with generic quotes such as “today marks the first day of the rest of your life.” Whoever had come up with that clearly hadn’t experienced loops.

“You won’t find them there,” Mister June said casually.

“Find what?” The boy tensed up.

“My diplomas. School management insisted I have them, but I refused. This office is for people like you, not a room I could turn into my own trophy case.”

“Yeah.” Mentally, Will let out a sigh of relief. That was a bit too close.

“So, what’s worrying you?” The man held a paper notepad ready.

“Don’t you use a tablet for that?”

“Absolutely no. This is the best way to make sure that your data remains safe.”

“What if someone steals your notes?”

“That’s unlikely,” the man laughed. “Trust me, everything you share here is safe.”

“As safe as Daniel’s file? I heard that the contents of the folder are gone.”

The accusation quickly wiped off the smile on Mister June’s face. Initially, Will thought that he had caught him in a classical gotcha moment. Unfortunately, it quickly turned out not to be the case. The counselor was very touchy when it came to professional ethics and even a jokey accusation—not that this had been at all jokey—was enough to make him clam up and get the boy out of his office. Clearly, this wasn’t the way.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

“So, what’s worrying you?” The counselor asked.

“Before Danny killed himself, he told me that he felt trapped,” the boy tried a new approach. “As if he was reliving the same day over and over again.”

“I see.” The man jotted something down. “Were you two close?”

“No. I mean, not particularly at first.” Helen had texted him exactly what to say in order to get the best reaction. The key was not to get sidetracked again. “I think I mentioned I felt trapped during gym one day, so we got talking.”

“Interesting. He never mentioned it before.”

“Maybe he forgot?”

“I doubt it. He had a remarkable memory.”

*Oh well, here we go again.*

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

“I see. Were you two close?”

“Not particularly. He mentioned it once. I didn’t think much of it until he killed himself.”

“Daniel didn’t kill himself,” the counselor corrected. “What happened was a tragedy, an avoidable tragedy, but it wasn’t suicide.”

“That’s what everyone’s saying.”

“Look, Will,” the man put the notepad away. “This is school. Rumors are part of life. Exaggeration and lies are their own currency. When I say that it was avoidable, I meant that steps could have been taken to reduce his level of stress. The fact that you’ve come to see me is already a good sign.”

“I don’t feel it is.”

“I’m sure it feels like that. You probably feel that this whole place is like a prison that refuses to let you go. If you come here thinking that every day, of course, you won’t feel well. It’s like punishing yourself, then wondering why things are like they are.”

The conversation changed focus, according to plan. Now it was time for the second part.

“Umm, sorry, can I go to the bathroom for a bit?” the boy interrupted.

“Now?” the counselor arched his brows.

“It’s stupid, but… I want to be alone for a few minutes. Please.”

The explanation was such that a five-year-old wouldn’t fall for it. Yet, for someone who had gone through years of college, plus all the additional training programs, there was no way to say no. With an understanding smile, Mister June gave the boy a nod, then took his notepad again to jot his conclusions so far.

In the corridor, Will quickly took out his phone and sent Helen another thumbs up icon. This was the sign. Now all she had to do was climb to the second floor on the outside of the building without being seen and see exactly where the man put the file.  

No sooner had he done so than the phone rang. It was Helen.

*Huh?* “What happened?” the boy asked in a hushed voice. In his view, she was taking way too many chances. No wonder she had failed to get the file even after so many attempts.

“You were right,” Helen said. “He called the vice-principal.”

“So that’s where the files are kept?”

“Maybe. I’ll create a distraction. You get in the vice principal’s room and find it.”

That was the opposite of what the plan was supposed to be. Originally, he was supposed to be the distraction, and Helen had to trash up the counselor’s room and get the file.

“Are you sure?” he asked.

“It has to be in one of the two places. I’ll see where he puts your file and check the place. You go through the principal’s office.”

“Why don’t we do that next—” a faint sound told him that the conversation was over “—loop.”

Left with little choice, Will rushed along the corridor. He was almost certain that they’d fail, but that didn’t prevent him from giving his all. In the end, the loops were a means to gain experience in doing something. At the moment, their teamwork was highly disorganized. The plan was Helen’s. He was only playing a role in it. Regardless, all that mattered was finding the file. Once they did that, they had eternity to streamline the process.

As he reached the staircase, the unmistakable sound of shattering glass echoed from above. It sounded like two trucks carrying windows had crashed into one another. Sadly, Will knew that wasn’t the case. The sound had been burned into his mind for as long as he could remember.

*Did you have to call the wolves?* He ran faster.

Yells and screams soon followed. Helen had indeed been true to her word. This was a distraction the whole school would react to. The principal’s office was right in front of him, less than a few doors down the corridor. However, just as he neared it, the door handle turned down.

*Oh, crap!* Will leaped forward, sliding along the corridor.

The door opened, letting the vice-principal and the secretary rush out less than a split second after he had slid past. Not wanting to ruin his achievement, he quickly rolled to the side, hiding from view behind the door itself.

“What do you mean wolves?” the vice-principal yelled into her phone. “How can there be wolves?”

“I’m calling the police,” the school secretary said in a hushed voice, trying to keep up.

“Just go inside and close the door!” She glanced at the other woman beside her. “Yes. Frankly, I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. This better not be someone’s idea of a prank.”

Quietly standing up, Will made his way to the door, then, using his reflexes, slipped inside, closing and locking the door behind him. The action was likely noticed, but at this point, it didn’t matter. Fifteen minutes remained until the end of the loop. In that time, he had to find the location of their prize.

The desk was the usual choice to start. As usual, it was kept locked, but in her panic, the vice-principle had left the room leaving the keys behind.

*Score*, Will thought as he went through the drawers.

The first thing he found were the vice-principal's e-cigarettes. The woman clearly had a passion for them, for there were no less than five different ones, all filled up. Administrative documents filled the rest of the desk. The only things that stood out were a few transfer student printouts, and a half filled out expulsion form.

*Wow.* The boy paused for a moment, reading through the form. *Never knew you were about to get kicked out, Danny.*

Given the accusations listed, it wasn’t surprising. Apart from being described as disruptive, violent, and anti-social, one of the sections filled out stated that Mister June considered him a threat to himself and others. Interesting why he hadn’t mentioned that while Will was in his office.

The boy’s phone rang again.

“Hey,” he placed the phone between his head and shoulder as he went back to going through the last sections of the desk. “Found anything?”

“The binder’s empty, same as last time.”

“Well, I think my hunch was right. The harpy was about to expel Danny. There’s a note of June’s opinion, so she must have had the file to include it.”

“Expel? That’s impossible.”

“I’m looking at the papers right now. My guess is, if his loop had lasted a few more days, he would have been out of here.”

“That doesn’t make sense!”

“I’m just telling you what I saw.”

“I’m heading to you.”

“No! The door—” Will heard her end the call again “—is locked…”

*Why do I bother?* He thought.

With the desk fully rummaged, he quickly went to the cabinets containing the school files. Everything relating to a student went there, from student information to all their grades and teacher comments. With the opportunity presenting itself, Will gave into temptation and went through his own file. To his major disappointment, there was nothing particularly special there. His grades were okay and most of his teachers considered him smart but lazy.

Suddenly, the windows shattered. Fearing a wolf attack, the boy jumped away, grabbing the nearest object to use as a weapon.

“Chill, it’s me!” Helen said. Despite her dramatic entrance, not a single wound or scratch was visible. “Found anything?”

“I was just going through our files,” he said, only then glancing at what he was holding. As it turned out, it was a miniature Edgar Allan Poe bust.

“And?”

“You dropped in.” Leaving the bust in its place, the boy returned to the cabinet. “The expulsion papers are at the desk somewhere.”

Helen glanced at the desk, then at the file cabinet.

“I’ll check the desk,” she said.

“Sure.” He went back to searching through student files. “Why doesn’t anyone use computers here?”

“It’s Enigma High. What do you expect?”

“What’s his family name?”

“Keen,” the girl replied. She had found the document in question and was now reading and rereading it, as if trying to convince herself it was fake.

“Right, Keen.” Will continued rummaging.

*Kallan, Kackeron…* he tossed binders one after the other. *Keen.*

“Found it!” he said, waving it in the air. “Wow. His grades are really high.”

“That’s what happens when you’re in a loop.” The girl joined him. “When you’re bored in class, you just read ahead.”

Skimming through the general data, Will soon reached a yellow divider titled “Psychological – Copy”. It wasn’t what they originally had set out to find, but it had to do. Holding his breath, he turned the binder. Nothing followed.

“No!” Helen shouted in anger and annoyance.

*You must be kidding me!* Will thought. He flipped back to the beginning of the pages, then back again, as if hoping that the information had been misplaced.

“What if the cops took it?” he asked.

“His mother would have known. She was convinced it was still here.”

“Well, it’s clearly not. The only explanation is—” he stopped. There were several thin slivers of paper in the file behind the binder. “Look at this,” Will took them out. “Someone beat us to it.”

I am working on creating some monthly events at our new space downtown called Distillery Labs. We currently have the following events each month, but I am looking for any suggestions that would help get more people connected (and aware of the space down here).

Currently on the roster:  



\- Fail Club (4th Monday of Each Month, 430p - 630p) - Aimed at entrepreneurs & students; this event celebrates failure and the lessons learned so that we can all grow and know how to keep going.  

\- First Friday Coffee (morning) - Standard networking event; business, community, entrepreneurs  

\- Welcome Wagon (2nd Tuesday of Each Month, 430p - 630p) - Just a meet & greet with new folks and make some acquaintances in the area  

\- Trivia Nights (2nd Thursday of Each Month, 5:30p - 7:30p) - BYOF&B, fun curated trivia  

\- Family Game/Movie Night (Monthly Event) - Bring the kiddos and play games, watch movies, get up and move and meet others  

\- Slices & Startups (Monthly Event) - Connecting high school students with founders to talk about entrepreneurship, starting a business, and provide access to the spaces at Distillery Labs for young entrepreneurs; includes free pizza  

\- - - - - -  

We are completely open to bringing in more events. A couple of ideas we are exploring are intern mixers, college student mixers, and adult game nights (play tabletop, TCG, or any board games), and also looking at potentially having an ""old school"" LAN party where everyone comes in and plays online games, eats pizza, enjoys beverages and has fun.  

I'd love to hear from the community on what we could do that might actually get some more folks in here. If you aren't familiar with Distillery Labs, you can learn more on their website or chat with me, or come in and see the place - we are always happy to show off the space.

Glossy Lip Stain in Spicy Sienna, and I'm impressed with its unique formula.

This lip stain offers a sheer wash of color with a subtle glossy finish. It's not as bold as a lipstick, but it gives more pigment than a regular lip balm. I found it easy to apply and build up for more intensity. The color stayed put throughout the day without feeling dry or sticky on my lips.

I like that it's lightweight and doesn't transfer, so I don't have to worry about it smudging. The formula feels fresh on my lips, and I appreciate that it's made with skin-friendly ingredients. It's also vegan and cruelty-free, which is a big plus for me.

# Bottom Line

If you want a low-maintenance lip product that gives you color and shine, the e.l.f. Glossy Lip Stain is worth a try. It's perfect for everyday wear and comes in eight pretty shades. 

# Get to Know e.l.f. Cosmetics Glossy Lip Stain

I recently tried the e.l.f. Glossy Lip Stain and was impressed by its unique formula. This lip product sits between a balm and a lipstick, giving a sheer pop of color with a subtle shine. I found it lightweight and comfortable to wear.

The stain comes in 8 shades. I picked Spicy Sienna, which gave my lips a nice warm tint. The color stayed put for a while and didn't transfer much. I liked that it felt non-drying on my lips.

One thing to note is that the tube is quite small at 0.1 ounces. But a little goes a long way. The formula is buildable, so I could layer it for more intensity.

E.l.f. made this product vegan and cruelty-free, which is a plus. It's also budget-friendly compared to other lip stains I've tried.

# Sheer Pop of Color

I tried this glossy lip stain and was impressed by its lightweight feel. The color goes on sheer, giving my lips a subtle tint that's perfect for everyday wear. It's not as bold as a lipstick, but offers more pigment than a typical lip balm. The gloss effect adds a nice shine without feeling sticky. I like that I can build up the color if I want a bit more intensity. The stain lasts for several hours, even through eating and drinking. My lips felt comfortable and hydrated throughout the day. While the shade range is limited, the colors available are versatile and flattering.

# Long-Wear and Comfort

I tried this e.l.f. lip stain and was impressed by how long it lasted. The lightweight formula felt comfortable on my lips all day. It didn't dry them out like some other long-wearing lip products I've used. The stain left a nice sheer color that stayed put for hours, even after eating and drinking. I noticed some fading by the end of the day, but the subtle tint remained. The glossy finish gave my lips a fresh, hydrated look without feeling sticky. I liked that I could reapply it easily for a boost of shine. This lip stain strikes a good balance between long-lasting color and wearable comfort.

# Gloss-to-Stain Finish

I love how this lip stain transitions from glossy to matte. When I first apply it, my lips look shiny and plump. As the day goes on, the gloss fades but leaves behind a pretty tint. It's like getting two products in one. The color doesn't fully set right away, so be careful about smudging in the first 30 minutes. After that, it stays put nicely. I find I can drink coffee without leaving marks on my mug. The stain lasts several hours before fading evenly. It's not totally budge-proof, but it holds up well for a lightweight formula. I like that my lips don't feel dry or sticky as the gloss wears off.

# Skin-Loving Ingredients

I was happy to see that e.l.f. uses good stuff in this lip stain. It's 100% vegan and free from harsh chemicals. That's a big plus for me. My lips felt soft and smooth after wearing it. The formula didn't dry out my lips like some other stains I've tried. E.l.f. seems to care about using safe ingredients. They left out toxins and other bad stuff. I like that they make products that are good for your skin at fair prices. It's nice to use makeup that doesn't irritate my lips or cause problems.

# Pros and Cons

This glossy lip stain from e.l.f. Cosmetics has caught my eye lately. After trying it out, I've noticed some key points worth sharing.

# Pros

* The color payoff is impressive. I got a nice sheer tint that was buildable.
* It feels light on my lips. No heavy or sticky feeling here.
* The subtle gloss effect gives a fresh look without being too shiny.
* My lips felt soft and moisturized while wearing it.
* The formula is vegan and cruelty-free, which I appreciate.

# Cons

* The staying power could be better. I had to reapply after eating and drinking.
* Some shades look different on the lips than in the packaging.
* The size is quite small for the price.
* It can transfer a bit before fully setting.

I found the e.l.f. Glossy Lip Stain to be a nice middle ground between a lip balm and lipstick. The sheer color with a hint of shine worked well for everyday wear. It was comfortable and didn't dry out my lips.

The color range is good, but be aware that some shades might surprise you when applied. I liked that it's easy to remove at the end of the day.

For those who want long-lasting color, this might not be the best choice. You'll likely need to touch up throughout the day, especially after meals.

Overall, it's a solid option if you want a lightweight lip product with a natural-looking tint and some moisture. Just keep your expectations in check regarding its longevity.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this glossy lip stain for a while now, and it's clear why so many people love it. The e.l.f. lip stain has over 6,000 ratings on Amazon, with an average of 4 stars. Most users praise its smooth texture and soft feel on the lips. The color payoff is good, and it doesn't feel tacky.

Some buyers like that it's gentler than other lip stains and works well with face masks. The product comes in various shades, but a few customers got colors different from what they expected.

While many find it long-lasting, some say it transfers and fades quickly. The size is small, which some see as a downside. Overall, people seem to enjoy the subtle gloss effect and how it feels on their lips.

# Shades and Personalization

I tried out the e.l.f. Glossy Lip Stain in Spicy Sienna. It's one of eight shades available. The color is pretty and gives a nice pop without being too bold. I like that I can build up the intensity if I want more coverage. The sheer finish lets my natural lip color show through a bit, which I find flattering. It's great for everyday wear or when I want a more subtle look. The glossy effect adds a nice shine without being sticky. While I enjoy the Spicy Sienna shade, I wish there were more color options to choose from. Eight shades is a good start, but more variety would be even better for finding the perfect match.

# Usage and Application Tips

I found this lip stain super easy to use. The doe-foot applicator glides smoothly over my lips, letting me build up the color gradually. For a subtle look, I apply one thin layer. When I want more impact, I add a second coat. The formula dries quickly, so I don't have to wait long between layers. I like to blot my lips with a tissue after applying to set the color and reduce transfer. To keep my lips feeling fresh, I sometimes top it with a clear balm. The stain lasts several hours, but I touch up after eating or drinking. For best results, I exfoliate my lips first so the color goes on evenly.

# Conclusion

I've found the e.l.f. Glossy Lip Stain to be a solid choice for everyday wear. It strikes a nice balance between color and comfort. The lightweight formula feels nice on my lips without being sticky. While it may not last all day, it leaves a nice tint behind as it fades. The shade range offers something for most preferences. I appreciate that it's easy to apply and remove. For the price, it's a good value. If you want a low-maintenance lip product with a bit of shine, this could be worth trying. Just keep in mind the small size when considering your purchase.",1,1730736114.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

We share a ride to work daily since we live on the same street and his company provides the car, so he’s obligated to pick me up. But lately, there’s been this unspoken tension between us. We have this little ritual of shaking hands when we greet each other, and there’s always this lingering moment where he won’t pull away unless I do. Sometimes, he even plays with my hair during the ride, and recently, he’s started drawing circles on my knee. I poke his arm back, and we often end up locking arms, almost like it’s becoming a natural thing.

Sometimes, we have a third coworker in the car, and since I always finish work a bit late, I end up sitting in the back. When there’s someone else with us, the car gets super quiet. But as soon as we drop off the other coworker, I move up to the passenger seat, and suddenly we’re chatty and joking around, as if we’ve been waiting to be alone. Even in the office, we stay quiet if others are around, but when he finds me alone, he’ll joke around, pat my head, and just goof off.

Thing is, I’ve never been in a situation like this, so I’m not sure if this is flirting or just friendliness. I’m also not sure if I like him or if I just enjoy the thrill of the tension. His birthday is coming up, and I wanted to buy him coffee, but he just got assigned to another office for a week.

Ungodly hour because the film is just showing in a few theatres in order to qualify for a certain award (the theatre is open at that hour normally as well though - but no clue who usually ever goes then), so it's very empty.

Elderly man at the ticket booth before me says clearly: ""Hello. I'd like to watch film x and sit in row y, please."" The guy working the till looks just not all there yet overall. He replies in a condescending manner to the man: ""Hi. Which film? Which row?"" (Mechanically.) The customer is a bit taken aback, whereas I (and the colleague of the clerk who is standing behind making popcorn and coffee) chuckle. The customer repeats what he said, tries to enunciate (he was very clear before) and is a bit intimidated. It's my turn. I smile and say ""Hey, maybe your mate needs to make you a coffee. It's a bit early still. His first sentence was 'I want to see film x and row y.' Anyway, I want to see film x as well and the penultimate row, please."" He doesn't reply. I try to decide on snacks - while going over the snacks menu, I see that there is a poster on the glass at the snacks section of the counter that says ""only available until Halloween."" I'm a bit confused and say ""this says 'only until Halloween', but that has passed."" The guy working the tickets retorts ""Lady, you don't have the right to correct me here."" I'm absolutely taken aback and baffled. I reply: ""What do you mean? Why not just say 'Ah, sorry, I didn't hear the guy. 'haha, yeah, Tom, why haven't you brought me a coffee yet?!' Are the snacks available or not? If they aren't, why not just say 'yeah, I didn't see that, I'll take it off' or 'there are still a few available?'"" I'm really confused by his behavior now. It doesn't make sense to me at all.

Now he goes into full ""five year old throws a tantrum"" mode: ""Why would I do such a thing?! Why on earth would I correct that sign?! We don't have that candy anymore."" I am even more... perplexed - ""...because giving correct information to customers is important?"" I reply.

We raised two boys and continued to co-parent well. Now the boys are grown. I’ve been with my current wife for ten years. After ten years together, we married this summer. My extended family continues to invite my ex to family gatherings and my ex-wife continues to attend and while the boys were growing up, we allowed this for the sake of the boys and to not create any drama. I received an invitation by group text inviting us to a large family gathering. My ex-wife was not included in the group text and we had no reason to believe that she had been invited or planned to attend. The night before the event we learned that my ex had been invited and that she planned to attend. My new wife had a brief and polite text exchange with my ex in which my ex expressed that she planned to attend even if it was awkward. This was the first gathering since our wedding and so my new wife felt extremely awkward about it and said she would rather not go. So we changed plans and decided not to go. 
I had cousins I haven’t seen in years who were in town, I made plans to visit with the out of town cousins the next day for coffee before they flew home. 

I learned that my aunt had asked my mom whether she should invite my ex and my mom had given my aunt permission to invite her. Nobody asked us or gave us a heads up. 
My wife was very gracious and values that we have been able to get along with the ex for the sake of the boys but she was looking forward to spending time with my family for the first time as an official member of the family without my ex. I supported her and I understand how she feels. 

So we missed out on a fun gathering with aging relatives and faraway relatives. We tried straightening things out with my mom to avoid this happening in the future, but instead of understanding that things have changed and respecting my wife’s feelings, doubled down and tried to bully my wife into going to the event anyway. 

Our hope was that between now and the next gathering we could reach some understanding but instead my mom, my aunt, and my ex appear to have formed an alliance. 

AITAH for supporting my wife’s feelings and asking that the others understand how she feels? 

At this point we have decided we can only control our own behavior and responses and will likely choose not to attend family events that include my ex, other than funerals. 

As a side note, my mother and I had this same discussion about a year ago and my mom agreed that she would no longer invite my ex to events without asking us first because of awkward situations in the past. But she thinks giving my aunt permission to invite the ex was some kind of loophole and that she wasn’t breaking our agreement.

It’s very interesting according to my friends who have read it but I need others opinions. It’s completely free also. Can you let me know what you think so far ?

    CHAPTER ONE -- A Surprise for Eva
  

  A hand wrapped tightly around my throat, pulling me under into murky, dark waters. Panic surged through me as I flailed, limbs thrashing in a desperate bid for freedom. My mouth opened to scream, but no sound came out—only silence drowned beneath the weight of water.
  “Aruis” 
  “No”
  “Aruis”
  “Please stop” I murmur…
  “OMG, is she sleeping right now and dreaming of Aruis Blackwood?” A piercing voice cut through my sleepy haze. 
  Was that Loren?
  I blinked, the vision of the dark waters fading, replaced by the sterile glow of fluorescent lights in my small office. Shit, I must have fallen asleep working late.
  Loren stood before my desk, arms crossed and a smirk plastered across her perfectly made-up face. 
  Loren was the one person at work who had some hatred for me for no good reason. She’s a partner at CT Corps, tall, blonde, pretty, and has amazing style, but with a pretty nasty attitude that can even rival Blair Wardolf’s. 
  

  She’s the queen bee and I, Evaliegh Stone was her opposite. I was the pretty but weird loner. I had long black hair, a pretty face and terrible social skills. I can see why I was an easy target for Loren to bully. It has been a few weeks since I Joined CT Corps as a personal assistant to the CEO and Loren has been an awful thorn in my flesh that hurts the more I try to pluck it out hence I have made a resolve to let it be no matter how painful the thorn was.
  

  I lifted my head from the desk and got up immediately. Loren was now standing right in front of me with Cole Hastings, the CEO of CT Corps, behind her. He was in his early thirties and a very hardworking man. He was quite a good-looking guy as well. I suspect the fact that I was working directly under him might be the reason Loren absolutely hates my guts. She’s nice to everyone except me.  I have absolutely no interest in him aside from work though so I don’t care.  It seems they both are the first to arrive at the office today. I lift my hand, using the back to wipe my face to clear any drool that might have come out of my mouth.
  

  “Sorry sir. Hello Mr. Hastings. Hi Loren, I just took a quick nap. I’m awake now.  I was doing some last-minute double checks for your meeting today ” I say apologetically, with a polite smile and ignore Loren’s face of disgust. It was too early in the morning. I’ve learnt not to let her words or actions affect me. If I do, it’ll ruin my day before it even begins.
  

  We had a business meeting in a few hours. I spent the whole night in the office making sure everything was ready for CT Corps to win the business deal today.
  

  Loren was responsible for making the presentation to our potential investors with Mr. Hastings today. It’s all we’ve been talking about this week, and considering the crazy amount of times Loren has tried to sabotage my work, I didn’t want her to get the opportunity to blame me for anything in case something went wrong. After I worked on the presentation for her, I also made several copies of the document and kept them on different devices. 
  

  “Did you stay up all night at the office working on our proposal? Ms Stone ?” Mr. Hasting asked perplexed. 
  

  “Um yeah i did. I just needed to be sure everything was perfect. I know how huge this project is and what it’ll mean to win this for CT Corps ” I explain to him. This project was worth a hundred million dollars and would be our most expensive project if we won it.
  “You know what? Why don’t you come with us to the meeting? You’ve put in much effort, you deserve to at least see how it goes over there.”
  

  “What? She’s not even properly dressed and also we literally found her asleep and not even working. Why does she have to go with us, Mr Hastings.” Loren bitterly complained. She was obviously looking forward to both of them spending time together and if I went with them, I would be ruining that for her.
  

  Which was absolutely perfect for me.
  

  “I’d be happy to join the team. This will be the perfect opportunity for me to watch Loren do what she does best.” I said with fake enthusiasm. I could attend the meeting, learn something for myself and piss off Loren at the same time. This was a dream come true.
  

  “Didn’t you hear me? I said I don't want you there. You’ll ruin the meeting if you show up.” She retorted haughtily.
  

  “Loren! That’s enough I already asked her to come. You’ll stop this tantrum immediately unless you’re trying to disrespect my decision..” Mr. Hastings said with finality. 
  

  Did I mention i absolutely love Mr Hastings? He defends me whenever Loren takes it too far.
  

  “I’m sorry Mr. Hastings. I spoke too quickly without thinking. I too think it’d be a good opportunity for her to learn.” Loren immediately switched her attitude. 
  

  “Great. Now let us be on our way.” Mr. Hastings said and left my Office, walking into his.
  

  “Yes sir.” I chirp and begin walking out too but Loren grabs onto my arm, her acrylic nails digging into my skin painfully. 
  

  “You might have won this round bitch but don’t get too cocky. If you go against me, you might just end up drowning.” 
  

  Drowning 
  

  Hands
  

  Nighttime
  

  The dream I had played in my mind. I shiver at the memory. -- Strange Nightmare.
  

  “This look doesn’t suit you, Loren. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you look scared and threatened.” I taunted with a smirk.
  

  “You !-” She screeched lifting her hand to smack me but I grabbed it at the last second.
  

  “Good Luck Loren. You’ll definitely need it today.” I shoved her off and walked out. I had to get ready for the meeting ASAP. I head to the washroom and splash water all over my face, wiping it dry with a towel.
  

  I looked at myself in a mirror.
  

  “Hey, you’ll be fine Evaliegh Stone. You’ve totally got this.”  I give myself a little pep talk. I put my hair into a sleek ponytail bun and put on some light make-up to hide my under-eye bags. 
  

  I hurried out into the car, Loren and Mr.Hastings joined me shortly and we drove to the B Group Headquarters. 
  

  I’ve only read about Aruis Blackwood and his family online. The Blackwood family was the Synonym of gods in Aqe city. They were from Old money. They were even connected to the royal family if you traced their family history back a few generations... Arius Blackwood was the CEO of the Blackwood group and the most eligible bachelor in Aqe City. From his pictures, he was dashingly handsome. Dangerously and ruggedly beautiful. Every woman’s wet dream. Rightfully just a dream though because he was never caught in any dating scandals. But that might also be because the media is scared to publish anything negative about him. I don’t blame them. He was a powerful and dangerous man who could get away with anything.
  

  Soon enough, we arrive at the B group Headquarters, a tall skyscraper like a powerful god. It was located in the luxurious part of town, and the tallest among the other buildings. B group was really on top of the hierarchy. I grew a little nervous. Was CT Corps good enough for this bid? Was the presentation I put together for Loren good enough? I squeeze my fingers together in a silent and nervous prayer. I hope I don’t embarass CT Corps.
  We walk into the Large as life luxury building. There are people everywhere. Looks like we are not the only ones here to bid for this project. My nervousness increases.
  

  

  “Oh my Gosh, Eva please stop looking around like a bum country girl,” Loren says with an eye roll.
  

  I turn to glare at her. I’m already beginning to feel anxious by myself. I don’t need her bitchy cattiness right now.
  

  Mr. Hastings seems to understand and comes through. He steps in between us.
  

  “Ms Stone, Loren and I will find a place to sit. Can you go and get us registered?” He points towards a stand where companies are registering for the meeting.
  

  “Of course Mr. Hastings,” I reply and walk away.
  

  “This is why she shouldn’t have come here in the first place. She’s going to cheapen us with her low-class attitude.”
  I heard Loren complaining before I Left. 
  

  What at all did Loren have against me? Why was she my biggest hater? Was it just because of Mr. Hastings? 
  

  I feel a pair of eyes dig into the back of my skull. It was probably Loren trying to cut my head off with her glare. Thank Goodness her eyes weren’t razors.
  

  I turn around but she’s not looking my way
  

  Strange… I  could swear she was staring. I ignore it.
  

  “Hi, I’d like to register three people from CT Corps for a meeting with the B-group team,” I say to the receptionist who is dressed up in a suit and a full face of makeup. I look like I was the receptionist whilst she was here for a business meeting. B group must really have high standards. 
  

  “Sure, Go ahead and  fill these forms.” The receptionist smiles nicely and hands me a form to complete, which I do.
  

  I register our names and she then directs us to a conference room. 
  Loren shoulders me and heads inside first. She earns an eye roll from me...
  

  It's an empty smaller room with a large TV and Swivel chairs around a mahogany table. Simple and minimalistic, yet expensive and elegant. 
  

  “Mr. Hastings. Sit beside me. I have something to discuss with you swiftly.” She calls to him. 
  

  Mr. Hastings turns to look at me. Probably to invite me to join them sit together but I’d never know for sure because Loren probably guessed the same and acts quickly.
  

  “Why don’t you do your job and make us some coffee, Ms Stone ?”. She pulls him into a chair and plumps down right beside him, totally dismissing my prescence..
  

  “I don’t need coffee. Thank you, Loren. Ms.Stone, please join us.” Mr Hastings responds quickly, beckoning me over. Cole Hastings was always kind and nice to me, trying to save me from Loren’s little evil plots.
  

  “I’m a bit nervous. I’d get one if you wouldn’t. Coffee will surely calm my nerves.” Loren says hurriedly.
  

  Yeah nervous my foot. She was obviously just trying to prevent me from partaking in anything related to the actual work and just wanted to use me as a maid.
  “It’s fine. I’d go. How do you like your coffee, Loren ?” I ask her politely. I’d just hurry it and come back before the presentation begins.
  

  “Extra sweet.” She’s talking to me but she doesn’t even have the decency to look at me. She bats her eyes  at Cole Hastings. 
  

  Typical
  

  “Got it, Loren.” I turn to leave and slam into a wall.
  

  “Ouch!” I whimper and turn to look.
  

  Or Someone – 
  

  Not just Anyone but Aruis Blackwood.
  

  He’s outrageously tall. That is my first thought.
  

  He towers over me and I’m not even that short. He’s dressed in a sharp black suit that hugs him perfectly like a sudectress. He even looked better in person. My online research did not do him justice.
  

  I tilt my chin upwards and black dead-looking eyes stare back at me. 
  

  Arius Blackwood’s scowling black dead-looking eyes.
  

  “I- I’m so- sorry sir.” I stammer. Which I never ever do. My heart is hammering in my chest.
  

  I take a step back but stumble in my heels. His hand reaches out to grab my wrist, jerking me upright...
  

  His grip is tight and painful. I bite my lower lips so as not to make a sound. But that just makes him squeeze harder.
  

  The sound of a chair pushing back causes his eyes to shift from mine. I’m able to breathe a little better. Mr Hastings gets up in a hurry and approaches us.
  

  “Eva, Are you ok ?”. He doesn’t call me by my first name. He only calls Loren by her first name.
  

  “I-” My voice fades into nothing
  

  Do I admit I’m not? Why am I so frozen and scared? 
  

  “I think you’re hurting her Mr. Blackwood.” Cole Hastings says firmly.
  

  “Get Out !” His voice is firm and commanding. He was a true Aristocrat.
  

  “Mr. Blackwood.” Someone calls his name in confusion from behind. There are three other men behind him. I assume they are part of his team. They must be as confused as the rest of us. Did CT Corps manage to offend Aruis Blackwood somehow? 
  What the hell was going on? 
  

  “Everyone Get Out! Now !” he didn’t need to say it again, as everyone scrambled out.  Mr Hastings looked like he was contemplating it, but Loren grabbed him and they both left. He gives me a worried look whilst Loren gives me one of pure non-diluted disgust. That’s expected.
  

  I waited for him to let go so I could follow but when he didn’t I attempted to sidestep him but he jerked me against him.  
  

  Hard
  

  “Mr.Blackwood” I gasp in shock. Heat engulfs me in a second as I’m flashed against his warm strong body.
  

  “Where is my child, woman?” He asks Coldly.

The cup blueprint has integer variables for coffee, milk, syrup, topping etc. When making the drink the integers increase. So a single coffee shot is 1, double shot is 2, steamed milk is 1, frothed milk is 2 etc etc.

I have a data table with the recipes. Eg:   
Latte = Coffee 1, Milk 1, Syrup 0, Topping 0  
Large Latte= Coffee 2, Milk 1, Syrup 0, Topping 0  
Cappuccino with choc sprinkles= Coffee 1, Milk 2, Syrup 0, Topping 1

When the cup is finished I want it to look at it's current variables, compare against the data table for a matching recipe, then change it's mesh and label to the created drink.  


How do I go about that? Tutorials are showing how to use data tables and access specific data within the table. But I haven't found one to essentially do multiple VLOOKUPs and match a row.",1,1730735215.0,unrealengine,1,1.0,False

1gjhcia,https://www.reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/comments/1gjhcia/i_saw_a_ghost_today/,I saw a ghost today.,"Kal mein gaadi chala raha tha, saath me badiya songs chal rahe the, ek cup coffee thi cupholder mein, aur mein maje se jaa raha tha.

Achanak mujhe unknown number se raat ko 1 baje call aya, mene cut kar diya. 2 second baad mujhe firse same number se call aya, mene uthaya aur samne wala ko suna to pata chala ki yeh to mera friend hein.

Friend – bhaiiiiiii, jaldiiiiiii, mein fas gaya hoon, jaldi kar, mujhe kuch samaj nahi aa raha kya karu!?


Me – kya hua bhai bol, abhi aya tere ghar pe, tension mat le.


Friend – nahiii, nahiii, ghar pe mat jana, mein ghar pe nahi hoon.


Me - to kaha pe au? bol kya hua?


Friend – jaldiiiiii, jaldiiiiii aa yaar.


Me – kidhar parrr!?


Friend – mere dada ke......(call disconnected).


Mene call back kiya par phone switch off aya.


Mein shock ho gaya ki kya ho gaya usko! Mene uske ghar pe call kiya aur pucha ki wo kidhar hein? Caretaker ne call uthaya aur bola:

Care-taker: ki wo to bahar gaya hein uske dada ke gaon mein, 3 din ke liye. Dada/dadi aur uncle/aunty to bahar gaye hein, wo akela gaya hein gaon mein - use mana kiya tha , par wo chala gaya gaon zidd karke. Kuch hua hein kya? itni raat ko call kiya apne!?


Me: Uska call aya tha par cut ho gaya aur ab switch off aa raha hein, mein jata hoon uske dada ke gaon, address batao.


Fir mene address note kiya aur GPS set kiya, songs off kardiye the aur coffee thandi hogayi thi.

Mein uske gaon ke entrance pe poch gaya aur gaadi park kar di. Aage bahot hi chota rasta tha, gaadi nahi jaa pati usme se. Mene mobile liya mera, torch chalu kiya aur aage badha.

Raat ke 3 baje the, ghor andhera tha, thandi hawa aa rahi thi aur janwaro ki awaj aa rahi thi, door door koi kutta bhaunk raha tha aur meri gaand fatt rahi thi.  
Mene ek ghar ka darwaja knock kiya, koi old aurat bahar ayi

Old Aurat: Aaj dhood dene itni jaldi aa gaya?


Me: Mein doodhwala nahi hoon dadi, mujhe ye batao......(she interrupted)


Old Aurat: Doodhwala nahi hein to kaun hein tu? Idhar kyu aya hein? Raat to aaram se sone bi nahi dete baatamez.


Me: Mera dost idhar aya hein, aapko pata hein wo kidhar hein?(I mentioned his name).


Old Aurat: Wo udhar uske dada ki haweli mein hoga, sidha chalta reh aur right side mein uski haweli ayegi, uske saamne ek bada sa kua hein.


Me: Okay, thank you dadi.


Old Aurat: Wo jagah mein bhoot rehte hein, wo haweli bhooto ka ghar hein, mat jaa udhar, tu vapas nahi aayega!


Me: Kya!? Bhoot Voot kuch nahi hota!


Old Aurat: Baatamez, nikal idhar se, raat ko gyan mat pel.


Mein chalne laga aur haweli pe pocha, mein mere dost ka naam chilane laga aur usko dhoondne laga.
Koi awaaz nahi ai saamne se, sirf door door se kutte bhaukne ki awaaz aa rahi thi.

Mene haweli ka darwaja khola aur andar chala gaya.
Andar koi light nahi thi, ghor andhera tha aur darr ke mare mujhe pasina aa raha tha. Mein mere dost ka naam chilate chilate aage badha.

Mein chal raha tha aur mere per ke niche kuch aa gaya, niche dekha to mein shockkk ho gaya aur jor jor se chilaya, mere daant tak kanp rahe the, mujhe dimaag mein kuch yaad nahi aa raha tha – niche ek khopdi pati thi, human skull pada tha.

Mein wo uthane gaya to piche se awaaz ai kisi ke chalne ki, meri piche dekhne ki himmat hi nahi hui – dheere dheere wo awaaz badh rahi thi; koi mere karib aa raha tha.

Koi mere nazdeek aya aur bola:

Ghost: Chole Bhature khayega?


Me: Tumm kon ho?(Mein rone hi wala tha darr ke mare).


Ghost: Mein chokidaar hu iss haweli ka.


Me: Achaa, itni raat ko kidhar tha, mein jab andar aya tab to tu nahi tha?


Ghost: Khana lene gaya tha, puri raat kaam jo karna hein.


Me: Muh dikha apna, cover hata ye jaldi se.(Usne pura face cover karke rakha tha apne cap aur bade size ke jacket se).


Ghost: Arey sir mujhe infection hein, thanda weather suit nahi karta. Aap idhar kyu aye?


(Usne mujhe gaslight kar diya, aur cover nahi hataya, saala ghost)


Me: Mein mere dost ko dhundne aya hoon. Apne dekha usko?


Ghost: Chalo saath mein dhundte hein. Mein upar ke floor pe jata hoon, aap kitchen mein jao.


Me: Okay, mile jaye wo to mujhe awaaz dena.


Fir mein kitchen mein gaya aur dekha to mera dost behosh pada tha. Mene uspe paani dala aur use uthaya.


Dost: Bhaiiiiii, tu aa gaya, thank you.


Me: Tujhe kya hua tha? Behosh kaise hua?


Dost: Bhaiiiiii, udhar ek khopdi padi hein, use dekha to chakkar khake behosh ho gaya.


Me: Yeh sab chod, chal ghar jaate hein, upar wo chokidaar gaya hein use bulata hoon mein.


Dost: Kon chokidaar?


Me: Arey ye haweli ka chokidaar. Jo yeh haweli ki chokidaari karta hein wo.


Dost: Koi chokidaar nahi hein idhar.


Mein: Wo upar gaya hein, ruk bulata hoon(Mein chokidaar ko awaaz dene laga, parr koi aya hi nahi).


Dost: Kisko awaaz laga raha hein?


Me: Bhai use kuch hua lagta hein, chal upar jaake dhundhte hein.(Fir hum log upar gaye aur shockkkkkkk ho gaye)

Hamne pura ghar dhundh liya par koi nahi mila. Aur gharke saare windows andar se bandh the. Hume ek jacket mila, aur wo jacket wo hi tha jo us chokidaar ne pehna tha.

Me: Bhai yeh jacket pehenke hi aya tha wo!? Yaarrrrr sach bol raha hoon.


Dost: Yaha se nikalte hein jaldi, yeh jagah sahi nahi hein.


Me: Chal jaldi, gaadi bahar hi khadi hein.


Hame ghar ke andar chokidaar nahi mila kahi pe aur jab ham bahar jaa rahe the, tab hamne dekha ki ghar ka darwaja to andar se bandh hein! To wo chokidaar gaya kidhar!?

Fir hum log nikal gaye udhar se.

Dost: Ruk ek second, mein wo dadi to bata deta hoon ki mein jaa raha hoon.


Me: Bhai sath mein reh, mein bhi aaya.


Fir hamne wohi old aurat ka darwaja knock kiya. Wo bahar ayi.


Old Aurat: 2 Liter dhood dede.


Me: Arey mein dhood wala nahi hoon.


Old Aurat: Baatamez nikal idhar se(fir mene side mein nazar ki aur dekha ki wo chokidaar ki jo cap thi wo us old aunty ke piche padi thi).


Fir mujhe itna darr laga ki mein kuch bolne se bi darr raha tha, mene dost ka haath pakda aur dodne lage. Gaadi pe poche aur udhar se nikal gaye.

It's a close game 14-10 just let your ProBowl punter do his job.

When Cowboy history is written on the ""McCarthy Era"" there will be a subset called the ""DQ Years"" because the winning occurred during that time frame.

McCarthy should be let go in my opinion. 



Let's cross our fingers Dak is placed on IR.

It will give us fans a chance to see what Rush and Lance can do.

I get this sneaky feeling that the team will react positively to a change at the QB position.



\#13 is demonstrating why Will McClay drafted him.

Overshown is a gamer, just wish he got to wear #0 and flavor up as Agent Zero.



After watching Jerry's post game scrum it's crazy how much denial he is in.

Here are my suggestions for Jerry...

\- Fire McCarthy

\- Let Zimmer be HC (he never would have done the fake punt)

\- Plug Paul Guenther in at DC.

\- Cut Zeke

\- Place Dak on IR Return

\- Find playoff trade contenders for Zack Martin and Brandin Cooks.



The season is over and what your doing now is seeing how this team plays with a different deck of cards.

It's an evaluation that is critical for moving forward.



Go Cowboys!

Almond- perfect almond taste, so good in Greek yogurt and baked goods.

Butter- rich buttery taste, so good in baked items and Greek yogurt.

Banana- absolutely delicious but little goes a long way, if you add too much then it tastes like banana laffy taffy (which I like lol). Goes well in baked goods, oats, coffee, and Greek yogurt. 

Cake Batter- easily my favorite, it’s a sweet cakey taste and it goes well in everything (oats, baked goods, coffee, and Greek yogurt). 

Butter, Almond, Banana, and Cake Batter (ranking from least sweet to most sweet).

Met a pAP about 6 weeks ago on AM. Since then we text multiple times a day, exchange pics, also spicy ones, talked about our expectations, lifes, etc. all that good stuff. 
It’s going great! I’m feeling a really good connection EXCEPT every time I push for a meetup for coffee or walk, something easy, to check in-person chemistry it falls apart at the last minute for a “family emergency” (better reason than that, but essentially in this bucket). Let alone that trying to setup a meeting feels like pulling teeth and scheduling one is solely initiated from my part.

Rant end. 

And now all together please: 

YOU ARE THE BACKUP!!!

","Hey there! I’m a 29-year-old trans woman, hoping to find a friendship that’s easy, genuine, and maybe just a bit magical. I’m drawn to people who bring warmth and depth, who love long talks over coffee (or a glass of something stronger) and who see life as an adventure of moments and memories. If you’re someone open-minded, resilient, and with a story or two up your sleeve, we might just vibe.

Setting up in my Bed as the days first light began make its way through my bedroom window setting there looking out of the window to a day that life has given me. I could see the sun as it light glimmered through and around the tree and its branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves.

With the quietness of the morning being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids walking by making their way to a nearby school. The early morning sounds would soon go away as I set there in bed Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.

 As I slowly got up making my to bathroom. Standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself a young Girl closing in on 30! Running my hand back through my messed blonde hair. Thinking to myself as I just stood there looking into the mirror thinking to myself what could a blue eyed girl could do to get through another day.

 Another day of let’s see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on thinking to myself “ Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here” making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee. 

Setting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what the day may have to look forward to. I thought to myself “ is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door I noticed my coat was still in the closet. Dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table making my way back into my room opening up my closet door. I reaching for it I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it. 

Walking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table setting down to open it up to Memories! Memories that later on I knew that I would need I just didn’t realize it at the moment. It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom as I wipe away a tear.

It didn’t seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.

 Who was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don’t realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this, 

“. To my lovely Daughter Dakota I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together. For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota to me knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself that no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 

Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that you will find too. Like some that you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.

Reading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring to me but little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring that day.

It was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running jumping onto my bed. Licking my face making himself known telling me in his way that another 
day was here another day to go exploring to find ourselves wondering into a world of our imagination. 

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying “ maybe later I’m not hungry right now” for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. 

But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying “ honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!” jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying “ just not now mom! I will be back later” making my way out the door as I looked back at my mom saying “ look I will be back later till then just chilling okay” as walked out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me, a journey that would in time change my Life forever setting on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself what else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.

 Looking down at buddy saying to him “ let’s go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here” with that I stood up saying to buddy “ let’s go! Let’s see for ourselves what else is out there” walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line. 

I thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there! 

Walking down the road dirt a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road that we really seen anybody. Looking at a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy as we ran to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

 Laying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there on the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up.  laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. Pulling out of the gas station I could feel as the wind hit against the blanket as we made our way down the road.

About fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we  passed by going down the road making sure at the same time that the driver didn’t see us.  Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him “ I know what you say if you could talk but I know what I am doing “ looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road.

 I thought to myself, what was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?” About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into a parking lot of a grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting I then heard the truck door open as a person then got out. 

Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear before uncovering myself and buddy making our way from the truck not looking back until we was far enough away. Looking across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 Walking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk. As people would pass us by not paying any attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves. Until we came across a gentleman setting in front of a convenient store. Looking at him he asked me saying “ well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you” saying back to him “ thanks buddy here is my dog that my mom got me from the pound” smiling back to me he then asked me saying “ so where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask”

Replying back to him I said to him “ just a girl and her dog finding our way in Life looking to what is out here for us.” Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us “ finding yourself! Why aren’t you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you”? Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then you when you are old enough. 

Then maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.” as he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

“ Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! 

But know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep. “ thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy made our way down the street I didn’t know then what he said as I would later in Life know for what he meant.

With the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on  me and buddy we decided to make camp there for the night Just with no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. “ You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life”.

 For everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life” as I Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me “ Please Dakota come home whenever you are please come back to me” waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

The next morning buddy and myself found our way across the field walking along thinking about the  journey ahead the journey would take us to where we was going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way!  Spending most of the day keeping  in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field.

Thinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn’t maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as I watched the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there, but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying “ we are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in Life.

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view just as the we made our way down the highway. Thirsty and hungry I felt laying there in the bed of pickup for I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as they passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world that I was not for sure off. A world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her” wait mom please come back please where are you going “ turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying “ I love you Dakota I love you wherever your are” with that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself what have I done? What have I done to my mom?

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Laying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me “ what! I can’t even believe to what I am seeing!”Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying “ you have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there” 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said said “yes very much so”

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me laying there in bed looking at him  saying “ hello “

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me “ who are you” I replied to him saying “ I am Dakota and what is your name” as he spoke bake to me saying “ my name is Billy” walking closer to him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next too him. 

Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying “ the Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better” just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy.

 As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile “ it is okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?” Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me “ a journey! 

Man I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed” looking to Billy I said to him “ maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey” smiling to me Billy just looked at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

“ I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life. 
But hearing it in my mom and dads voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life”

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him “ I hope that one day that you will get better and that you will find your place in Life. And just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together” as Billy gave buddy one last hug I made my way to front door to where the authorities was waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me “ don’t you ever leave me again Dakota! Don’t you ever leave like that again me again” hugging my mom saying to her “

 I promise mom I will never leave you again” for as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking as I set there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me.

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Just knowing that I was there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me “ honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.” 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom’s letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom’s grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me. 

For me to grow to appreciate the Life that I had, For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. There was a place!
A Place In Heaven

I’m also a Canadian living the US. We have accounts/properties in both countries, so our financial picture can be a little convoluted. I’ve tried to include everything here, but if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. Sorry in advance for the long read, I'm pretty wordy! Unless specified, we live and operate in US Dollars (USD).

I did a previous Money Diary five years ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/c1pjkw/i_am_30_and_make_65000year_as_a_lawyer_in/). 

**Section One: Assets and Debt**

**Retirement Balance:** $6,066 CAD, $177,672 USD.

$16,667 in my Roth IRA, $127,314 in B’s Roth IRA, $9,144 in a joint HSA, $33,691 in a 401(k) from an old employer. I also am part of the state pension plan now that I work in the public sector. I have absolutely zero clue what that balance is. $6,066 CAD in an RRSP (I haven’t contributed since I moved to the US).

**Equity if you’re a homeowner:** $750,000-ish CAD, $150,661 USD.

We own two properties. A condo in Toronto that I purchased before I moved to the US and a house in Cincinnati we bought in 2018. The condo we own outright (see passive/inherited income section below) and comparable condos are selling for $750,000 - $800,000 CAD. Zillow says our house is valued at $237,300 and we still owe $86,639.

**Investments:** This is where my financial savviness sort of falls apart. $53,843 USD in a Guided Solutions Fund (55/45 split between stocks and mutual funds), B has money in Bitcoin (\~$15,000 USD I think), but I don’t really count that since he mostly just does it for fun and we treat it like we’re never going to see the money again. \~$18,000 CAD in investments. My parents manage the Canadian investments for me since I’m not a resident anymore, so I’m not sure of the exact amount.

**Savings account balance:** $11,789 CAD, $82,965 USD.

$27,790 USD in targeted savings (dog, car, house, vacation, etc.), $55,175 USD in a HYSA, $11,789 CAD in a general savings account (some of this goes to paying taxes every year and then I’ll move a chunk over into investments after).

**Checking account balance:** $8,853 CAD, $5,956 USD.

I pay all our bills and credit card out of our USD checking account every month, so it’s high right now, but we usually only carry a balance of \~$1,500.

**Credit card debt:** Zero. We pay our credit card bill every month.

**Student loan debt:** Zero. My parents paid for my undergraduate degree, I got good scholarships for my masters and law school, and my parents helped cover the remaining balance. My husband’s parents paid for his schooling.

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** I graduated law school and passed the bar in 2018. I started making $60,000, I got one raise to $65,000 during my time at that job. I started my current job in 2021 making $68,000. I’ve received steady annual raises as well as COLA to bring me to $88,000 today.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $2,470 bi-weekly after taxes, pension, insurance, HSA

**B’s Main Job Monthly Take Home:** B’s hourly and his job is project-based so his take home varies. On average, he makes $850/week post-tax.

**Side Gig Monthly Take Home:** $2,230 CAD rent for the condo

**Did you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.**

I took this from the actual Money Diaries because I feel like it provides an important picture of our finances.

So much yes. I’m very aware of how lucky I am, and I’m also very upfront about the privilege I’ve had. Especially when talking about student loans or buying property with friends. I try not to rub it in, but also want to make it clear that because of the help we’ve received it’s why my husband and I can do things that would otherwise be above our salary band.

My parents paid for all my education expenses above what I received in scholarships. This included my rent during undergrad, masters, and law school. B’s parents similarly paid for his education and his rent during undergrad and law school. When my maternal grandparents died, they left me money. I was in elementary school at the time, so my parents (along with their financial planner) helped me to invest that money, which ultimately resulted in \~$250,000 CAD in 2013, which I used as the downpayment on my condo. My parents loaned me the remaining $125,000 CAD for the purchase price, so I had a private loan with them. In 2023 my final grandparent died and my parents received money from their estate, they used that money to forgive what was remaining on my condo loan, so we now own the condo outright. My paternal grandfather gave B and me $10,000 USD to go towards our home downpayment, which we added to $50,000 USD we had saved. My parents again privately loaned us the remaining balance for the house, and we are paying them back at 4% interest. In addition to that, we’re very fortunate to have parents that want to spend time with us and have the financial ability to pay for our travel expenses if we are doing things with them. We are also on my in laws phone plan, and they refuse to accept money in exchange.

Because of all this help, I would not classify us as financially independent from our families. While it’s always been important to B and me that we can pay our own way – we got approved for mortgages for both properties independently, and then my parents charged us a loan amount based on what we were approved for – so that if our parents’ assistance was ever to stop, we would still be able to make all our payments. But in my parents’ case, they want to financially help us because they want us to be afforded the same opportunities they had at our age, and we gratefully accept.

**Section Four: Money Diary**

**Day 1 - Monday:**

6:53 am: Combo of sunrise alarm and dog whining for breakfast wakes me up. I scroll my phone for a little bit and then finally get up. Get ready for work, feed the dog, give him his eye drops (he’s one month post cataract surgery), pack my lunch, and head out.

 8:12 am: Get to work and it’s a colleague’s birthday. Have a pumpkin spice donut from Dunkin and chat about his weekend. Make a cup of tea and finally start working: answering emails from the weekend, making some changes to a contract, general Monday morning things.

10:07 am: Have a meeting with a colleague about some large-scale future projects we have coming up at the end of this year/Q1 next year. Talk through projects, next steps, etc. Leave the meeting with additional stuff on my to-do list that I start working on.

12:30pm: Take a break for lunch. I make an open face sandwich with scallion herb chickpea salad ([this Budget Bytes recipe](https://www.budgetbytes.com/scallion-herb-chickpea-salad/); it’s so good), and have some cucumber, carrots, and a leftover cookie from the birthday spread this morning. I watch Love Island while I eat (I’m catching up on this past summer’s Love Island USA and so far, it’s my favourite of the USA version. I just hit Casa Amour and these boys are messssssssy).

4:47 pm: Got busy this afternoon with unexpected meetings, reviewing some documents for a different department, and other random stuff, but all done and heading out for the day.

5:24 pm: Get home and B’s still working so I change and take the dog for a walk.

5:58 pm: Someone just pulled over to ask me if we breed our dog because they fell in love at first sight. I regretfully tell them that he’s neutered and a bit of a basket case, so they wouldn’t want his offspring anyways and we continue our walk. This honestly happens more often than you would think.

6:12 pm: Get home, do the dog’s evening eye drops, eat a Sour Patch Kids (assume all candy I eat over this week is Halloween/snack size and I’m not just downing full sized candy bars on the reg), do a load of laundry and fold some clean clothes while starting the newest season of Love is Blind. B starts making dinner: spaghetti carbonara, my favourite!!

6:53 pm: Dinner’s ready and we watch Only Murders in the Building while we eat.

8:15 pm: We finished season 3 and I ate way too much pasta. I change over the laundry, do the dishes, and B puts on the Leafs game.

10:23 pm: I fell asleep at some point during the game. B wakes me up and takes the dog out and does his nighttime drops. B finds a bump on the dog’s eye as he’s doing drops, so he takes some pictures, and we agree to call the vet in the morning. I get into bed and B comes and tucks me and the dog in.

**Daily total: $0**

**Day 2 - Tuesday:**

6:43 am: Wake up and B had trouble sleeping so he’s already working. I lie back in bed for a little bit and scroll on my phone and then get up and take a shower.

7:48 am: I call the vet and they’re able to squeeze us in this morning. Text my boss letting him know I’m working from home this morning. B also decides he’s finally tired so heads to bed to take a nap.

10:24 am: The dog’s totally fine… of course. The bump is just part of the normal healing process apparently and everything looks great. I swear he’s manufacturing reasons to get me to bring him here because he loves it and gets so many treats and attention. Either way, crisis averted, and his happiness is priceless I guess (or more specifically, **$98**). Two different vet techs tell me they love my outfit though ([overalls](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/high-roller-jumpsuit/?color=045&type=REGULAR&quantity=1) \+ [shirt](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/classic-striped-oversized-crewneck/?color=266&countryCode=US&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwj4K5BhDYARIsAD1Ly2p8ZufLjeNFXad7bxP3xh1QQkWmiPqlNRMggsQfcz8ZsifczghcqSwaAgxZEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&inventoryCountry=US&utm_kxconfid=vx6ro62gj&type=REGULAR&quantity=1)) so that completely makes my day. Glad to see other people appreciate the toddler chic vibe I’m going for.

10:52 am: Get back home, respond to emails, change into actual work clothes, have some blueberries as a snack, unload the dishwasher, make the guest room bed, and head to work around lunch.

2:03pm: Come back from a meeting telling this group the same thing for the umpteenth time (spoiler alert: they still don’t get it) and reward myself by paying a dermatologist bill (**$87.33**, paid from HSA) and eating a 100 Grand.

4:53 pm: Get off the phone with an attorney who tries to tell me our zoning code is unconstitutional (dear reader: it’s not) because it doesn’t benefit his client. I explain in excruciating detail why it’s not unconstitutional and remind him of all the missteps his client has made over the past 2 years. We actually end the call with him agreeing with me, so I count that as a win! My job is basically a professional bad guy where I tell people why they’re wrong or why they can’t do something all day every day. I have a meeting tonight and I’m dragging, so I go to Starbucks to get a tea and snack (**$9.70** on a preloaded card).

8:27 pm: Leave work and stop by Panda Express on the way home to pick up dinner for B and me (**$19.60**). The nights I work late we typically just do takeout so that neither of us is having to cook at like 9 pm.

9:19 pm: Get home, chat with B about our days since we really didn’t see each other or talk much at all, eat dinner – I’m not that hungry after my snack so I only eat a few bites and now B will have leftovers for lunches – and have the World Series on in the background (as a lifelong Blue Jays fan, booo  the Yankees).

10:12 pm: I’m exhausted after today, so I get ready for bed while B takes the dog out, does his nighttime drops, and tucks us both into bed.

**Daily total: $117.60 (not counting the HSA payment or the pre-loaded Starbucks card)**

**Day 3 - Wednesday:**

7:04 am: Get up after a combo of my sunrise alarm and the dog’s snoring waking me up. I have a conference today, so I put slightly more effort into getting ready (actually do my hair and put on some makeup). I feed the dog, do his morning drops, and then head out.

8:27 am: Get to the conference and it’s a who’s who of my former bosses and colleagues. I work in a pretty niche area of the law where we all know and have worked with each other, so it’s always nice to catch up and learn what’s new in their worlds.

2 pm: B ran the Roomba and mop today and had to order more cleaner for the mop (**$20.45**).

5 pm: Leave the conference and head home, stopping for gas on the way (**$26.90**). It was a great day; I learned a lot and there were a handful of sessions directly applicable to things I’m dealing with so I’ll be able to use a lot of the information in my day to day work.

5:45 pm: Get home, chat with B, fill him in on all the hot goss from the conference (there really is none,  I just like to nerd out on what I learned), and give the dog lots of attention. I start prepping dinner ([Piri Piri meatballs](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/piri-piri-meatballs?srsltid=AfmBOor54958TJUVJM4PUP_ac9ngfwcTQW9QbxE85dvm88vrOOYHMc7c) from Bon Appetit) so B can cook while I’m at tap class. The Free People catalogue also came and I flip through that and find about a million new things I want – including a very beautiful but stupidly expensive [coat](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/henri-wool-stripe-coat/?category=catalog-products&color=060&type=REGULAR&quantity=1) that I am now coveting. I show it to B, and he just rolls his eyes.

8:44 pm: Home from tap and B has dinner ready. We eat the meatballs with zucchini and rice and watch the World Series. I have a Snickers Peanut Butter for dessert (these are a new to me candy and OMG they’re incredible!).

9:13 pm: We take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood. When we get back, B puts away leftovers while I do the dishes. I start getting ready for bed, B does the dog stuff and tucks us both into bed. I read (*The Ministry of Time* – for anyone whose read it… does it get better? I’m like ¼ of the way through it and it’s a tough slog. Anytime I go to pick up the book I feel a little dread. Help! Reviews please! Tell me if I should stick with it or just bail now.) a little bit before I finally fall asleep around 10:40 pm.

**Daily total: $47.35**

**Day 4 - Halloween (or Thursday):**

7:22 am: Finally get out of bed. I’ve been awake for a little bit but didn’t want to leave our cozy bed. Same drill as most mornings: get myself ready, feed the dog, do his morning drops, and then head to work.

8:28 am: Get to work and immediately jump on my first call. Today is basically back-to-back meetings and calls, so busy for me but probably boring to read about.

12:17 pm: Run to Costco on my lunch break to get olive oil and heartburn meds for B. I also get a mocha freeze as a treat for myself on the way out (**$45.61**).

5:21 pm: Get home, chat with B, and give the dog lots of love and attention. He’s been under the weather today, just sort of whiny and lethargic (we suspect just a stomachache, this is not the first time), so I make sure he knows he’s the best boy and we love him so much.

5:46 pm: Pour myself a beer and we all go sit on the porch with Halloween candy to get ready for trick or treaters. Halloween is my favourite night of the year in our neighborhood. Everybody sits on their front porch to hand out candy, there’s so many kids, and it’s just the best night of happiness, joy, and friendliness. All things we could use a little more of right now. B and I both sample a number of different candies throughout the night for quality control purposes.

6:48 pm: The rain is definitely deterring the trick or treaters, which kind of sucks, but I use the break to take the dog inside and give him dinner. He eats and drinks normally and even barks at a couple of passing trick or treaters, so I’d say he’s back to his normal self. Yay!

8 pm: Another Halloween over, and while the rain definitely kept the crowds away, it picked up towards the end and we still had blast. Now it’s time or celebrate with some [Nihilist Arbys](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBpbOW_O_Hd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) and broccoli from the Northside Yacht Club (**$35.20**). B and the dog stay outside for any stragglers, and I walk over to pick up our food.

8:37 pm: B and I split a beef and cheddar and broccoli and it’s all amazing. Arby’s is my favourite special the Yacht Club does, and I can’t believe I’m going to have to wait another year to get it again, but if you take anything from my Money Diary please let it be do not sleep on the broccoli at the Yacht Club! It’s one of the sneaky best, most underrated dishes in the entire city. The dog was begging for roast beef and broccoli the entire time, so safe to say whatever was bothering him earlier is officially gone. We all settle into a roast beef-induced coma; B watches Thursday Night Football and I keep reading my book.

10:18 pm: I’m sad tonight’s over, but I’m starting to get tired, so I get ready for bed. The dog’s still snoozing so B says he’ll do his nighttime routine late. B tucks me into bed, and I stretch out and enjoy having the entire bed to myself for once.

**Daily total: $80.81**

**Day 5 - Friday:**

7:56 am: I got up in the middle of the night to let the dog out, and didn’t sleep very well afterwards, so I let myself sleep in a little this morning. I get ready for work, feed the dog, do his morning drops, and head out.

8:45 am: Get to work, make a cup of tea, and chug basically an entire Stanley of water (I feel like a shriveled-up prune after two beers and salty food last night). We do all our financial reconciliation on the first of the month, so I spend a while paying all our monthly expenses, paying off our credit card, and moving money to savings.

9:22 am: Move onto doing actual work. I have to knock out a  memo for a council packet by noon summarizing a bunch of legislative changes we’re going to be making over the next six months or so. It’s going to equate to A LOT of work for your girl but should hopefully bring about some positive changes for the community. I close my door and focus on the memo.

10:24 am: Get an email that our Higher Gravity beer club membership (**$25**, included in monthly expenses) went through.

11:46 am: Finish my memo and start on a public records request we received. My co-worker brought in cookies, so I snack on one of those while I  work.

12:27 pm: Eat lunch (same as the rest of the week, chickpea salad, cucumbers, and carrots) while I continue to work on the public records request and make edits to the memo.

1:10 pm: All done with my edits and record request, so I head out for the day.

3:30 pm: Just woke up from a nap and it was glorious! I feel like a whole new person. I have a 3 Musketeers (texturally these are super one note and I don’t really understand the appeal) and spend the rest of the afternoon/early evening tidying p because we have friends coming to visit this weekend. I also take the dog for a long walk to tire him out and take a shower.

5:24 pm: Chat with my parents while out walking the dog. They’re at the airport and about to take off on a month’s long Europe trip, so this is the last time we’ll talk on the phone until they get back. I’m equal parts jealous and excited for them.

7:45 pm: Our friends, M&L, get here and our dog goes ham! He’s even more excited to see them than we are. We all briefly catch up but then get ready to head out for dinner.

8:30 pm: We have reservations at Pepp & Dolores, which is M’s favourite restaurant in Cincy so we always make a point of bringing them here. I get a Lambrusco spritz and then we order an insane amount of food to share. Standouts include broccolini, ricotta and sourdough, gricia pasta, and Limone pasta, but as per usual, everything was delicious (**$112**).

10:40 pm: We get home and just hang around and chat about life. M&L are people we are completely open with about everything so it’s nice to freely talk about things that could be considered too big or overwhelming for polite conversation. While we’re talking, I do the dog’s nighttime drops and he takes himself to bed.

12:00 am: Somehow conversations have devolved into discussing Scrooge McDuck’s net worth (here’s a [very informative Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2v7d1u/self_how_much_money_does_scrooge_mcduck_have/) we came across for those that are as invested as we were) and we all decide it’s time to pack it in for the night.

**Daily total: $112 (excluding monthly expenses for beer club)**

**Day 6 - Saturday:**

8:26 am: Even the dog slept in after such a late night! I get up and feed him, do his morning drops, and he goes to sleep on the cold concrete in the backyard. I make a cup of tea and keep reading (I would say I’ve shred from genuine dislike to agnostic acceptance).

9:02 am: B gets up and we hang out and read our respective books. B’s not a big reader but he’s an amazing cook and lover of all things food (it’s definitely his biggest passion), so he’s currently working his way through Jacques Pepin’s *New Complete Techniques*.

9:09 am: The dog comes in all excited from the cold weather, and to see that B’s up, and demands we play with him. There’s lots of karate chops (from B), sneezes and jumping (from the dog), and monster sounds (from me) as we chase each other and run around the dining room table. I love this silly little fam of mine.

9:18 am: The dog decides we’re done, and I’m a little dizzy from running in circles, so not exactly upset. We all go back to our various quiet morning activities.

9:30 am: M wakes up and we decide to walk the dog to Collective Espresso to get coffee. I buy all the drinks and also grab a couple of pastries (goat cheese and spinach Danish and cinnamon sugar cruffin) for us to share (**$33.92**).

10:15 am: L’s up when we get back and I pop the pastries in the oven to heat up.

10:40 am: Got distracted with the conversation and completely forgot about the pastries. Whoops! B saves them from the over and splits them up for us. Maybe slightly toastier than initially planned, but still delicious.

12:14 pm: Very slow-moving morning, which is perfect after the late night, but we finally pull ourselves together and head to Factory 52 with the dog. We start by grabbing beers at Hi Wire and the weather is perfect, so we sit on their rooftop patio and people watch below (**$20.16**). The City Flea is here today so we end up walking around there and I buy a cool, vintage University of Cincinnati sweatshirt (**$40**). We get stopped approximately every 10 feet by someone wanting to know what breed the dog is (Bouvier) and asking to pet him (of course, he’s an attention whore). M&L have never experienced a walk with our dog in a busy area before and they can’t stop laughing at all the attention he gets; it’s like hanging out with a celebrity. After the City Flea we take them to Jeni’s ice cream (they’ve never been!) and have a nutritious and delicious ice cream lunch. B and I split an iced molasses gingerbread and gooey butter cake (**$8.62**).

2:40 pm: We drop the dog at daycare and then head to the mall because we have Cheesecake factory reservations. The Cheesecake Factory is L’s and my guilty pleasure, and we don’t go very often so this is a very special occasion. We get to the mall a little early and walk around. B finds the cutest Christmas crackers (I feel like this is a very British/Canadian thing that hasn’t made its way to the States, and I always struggle finding them, so this is very exciting) at The Container Store and turns out I have a 25% off coupon, so we get them (**$28.29**).

4 pm: Cheesecake Factory time!! I’m so full of brown bread and buffalo chicken blasters that by the time my meal comes I only eat a couple of bites. B and I get a pumpkin and s’mores cheesecake to go for later (**$104**).

6:15 pm: As we’re leaving the mall we go into the Squishmallows store so M&L can buy gifts for their kids. Our brother-in-law and sister-in-law are pregnant, and we end up getting them a super cute sushi rattle Squishmallow that’s on sale for $5. B goes to pay and somehow gets upsold on another Squishmallow because it’s only $2.50 so we’re now the proud owners of an avocado unicorn I have zero clue what do with (**$8.08**).

6:45 pm: We pick up the dog from daycare and head home. B and M play video games while L and I chat about life and read our books. When the boys are done with video games, we open a bottle of wine and B and I introduce them to Quacks of Quedlinburg, one of our favourite board games and we play a few rounds.

11:32 pm: Full, tired, and happy, I do the dog’s nighttime drops and collapse into bed. B and M stay up a little later playing more video games.

**Daily total: $243.07**

**Day 7 - Sunday:**

8:06 am: Relishing the extra hour of sleep (although as soon as it starts getting dark at 4pm I’ll be grumpy about daylight savings like everyone else)! Everyone’s still sleeping so I just scroll on my phone in bed for a bit.

8:19 am: The dog’s up and starts whining for breakfast so I head downstairs, feed him, do his morning drops, make a cup of tea and alternate between reading and scrolling on my phone.

10:25 am: I’m going to the Taylor Swift concert in a couple of weeks and am trying to decide on my outfit. I think I want to do a Folklore/Evermore vibe since they’re my favourite albums and are best suited for November in Toronto weather. I find a cardigan on Amazon that’s supposed to be an excellent dupe of the official Folklore cardigan, so I order it (**$41.91**).

10:55 am: We walk up to the Comet for brunch, and I take a Sour Patch kids with me for the walk.

11:52 am: M&L loved the Comet! B got the eggs benny, I got the shrimp ceviche special, and we both got a coffee (**$42.50**). M got the chicken and waffle, and L got the biscuits and gravy and they both declare them the best versions of those dishes they’ve ever had. It makes my heart extra happy when people we love end up loving the places we love.

12:16 pm: M&L head out after we get back home. B works on his football picks, the dog snoozes, and I keep reading my book. B and I joke about going back to the Comet for dinner because the ceviche has made me desperately crave on of their burritos.

3:45 pm: B’s watching football downstairs and I’ve been reading in bed off and on while also scrolling on my phone and start getting a little hungry. B, being the total gem that he is, reheats some of the leftover spaghetti carbonara as a snack.

4:14 pm: The dog’s up and barking out the window at god knows what, so I decide it’s time to take him for a walk. I have a Snickers before we had out.

4:48 pm: We get back from our walk, I start a load of laundry, and then go back to my book. After 190 pages things are FINALLY starting to happen so now I feel like I need to stick with it.

5:15 pm: One of the characters makes a pot of tea and I decide that’s a good idea and do the same thing.

6:08 pm: We turn on the Brazilian Grand Prix (we LOVE a wet race) and eat some of our cheesecake. This is turning into a perfect night.

8:30 pm: We snack on some of our leftovers during the race and the dog gets some frozen yogurt as a treat. After we finish the race, we switch to last week’s episode of The Challenge.

9:34 pm: We finish The Challenge and B switches back to football. I move some laundry around, take out the trash, and run the dishwasher. My mother-in-law texts me about planning a baby shower for my sister-in-law over American Thanksgiving. Love that for me. I go down a Pinterest rabbit hole and finally decide on an adventure/travel theme. I don’t’ even bother consulting anyone else on the idea because I know 99% of the planning is going to fall on me anyways. Such is life when a Type A planner marries into a last minute, disorganized family. B says he loves the theme and reminds me I’m a very nice person (lol). He seriously is the best, and his family’s lack of planning bothers him even more than me, so I know he’ll help with whatever I need.

10:22 pm: The dog makes it known he’s ready for bed, so B does his nighttime drops while I get ready for bed. B tucks us both in. It was a perfect lazy Sunday with my boys!

The only thing that's not reflective is not seeing a grocery charge. I went Sunday before the diary started and spent \~$80 on groceries for the week (although that included some Halloween candy), which is pretty typically for us. We try to cook on weeknights and then just do take out or delivery on weekends. I promise I normally eat more fruits and vegetables than are reflected in this week. And way less candy.

1gjgyhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/seducingwomen/comments/1gjgyhw/video_7_point_checklist_for_dealing_with_approach/,[VIDEO] 7 Point Checklist For Dealing With Approach Anxiety and Women,"One of life skills as an adult we have to learn is emotional management and self-awareness, but approaching women- even for the best of us- can be scary. But approach anxiety is something we all have to deal with as men. Approaching girls is actually easy to learn, but hard to master. Not because it's technically hard, but because our emotions can get the best of us.

So if you're a still a newbie when it comes to talking to girls, here are **7 straightforward tips** that can help you push past that fear and actually start feeling comfortable approaching women:

1. **Start Small** – Don’t expect to go from zero to chatting up your dream girl right away. Start by just talking to *anyone* – your barista, a cashier, or even the guy at the bus stop. This isn’t about picking people up; it’s about building comfort with talking to strangers. The more you do it, the easier it gets.
2. **Desensitize Yourself** – Spend time in places where you'd like to meet women, whether that’s a bar, cafe, or park. The more familiar you are with an environment, the less anxious you’ll feel. Familiarity helps dial down that fight-or-flight response.
3. **Use Simple Observational Openers** – Forget cheesy pickup lines. Just comment on something around you, like, “Hey, that book looks interesting, what’s it about?” or “You look like a coffee expert—what did you order?” It keeps things natural and takes the pressure off.
4. **3-Second Rule** – When you see someone you want to approach, count to three and just go. The longer you hesitate, the more excuses your brain will come up with to back out. This rule is all about overriding that initial fear impulse.
5. **Get Comfortable with Rejection** – Here’s a tough pill to swallow: rejection is part of the game. And it’s actually a good thing because it builds resilience. She’s not rejecting you as a person (she doesn’t even know you); she’s just not interested right then. Shake it off and move on.
6. **Visualize Success** – Spend a few minutes every day imagining yourself approaching women and having good conversations. Visualizing success can help reduce your nerves when you’re actually in the moment.
7. **Celebrate Every Win** – Don’t just focus on whether you “succeed” in the interaction. Give yourself credit just for making the approach, even if it didn’t go perfectly. The more you recognize these small wins, the more your confidence will grow.

These steps won’t make approach anxiety disappear overnight, but they’ll help you make real progress. If you want more details, the full video has examples and a deeper dive into each tip – check it out [here](https://youtu.be/UcKN1WgMU6w).

I'm a SAHM, discussed and agreed , his job can be stressful, he deals with lots of big events and lots of people management, at times it can be overwhelming. 

I've noticed that whenever things are hard in work with events coming up or he's struggling with peoples mistakes etc. he's just not as nice as home. 
To a certain degree im ok with this. I can expect him to be nice and happy all the time. I support him in anyway I can. 

The main reason I snapped today was because he shouted at my 2yo. We have a system with discipline, we say no, warn him, and then get down on his level and sternly talk to him. Then it's naughty step and a potential shouting depending on the situation. 
Almost every time the job is stressful, this goes out the window with hubs. He just defaults to shouting straight away. 

My LO was super upset, he loves his dad ( further proof he's normally an awesome dad) 
I whispered to him, I think you shouted too soon. (We've agreed not to disagree with discipline in front of the children but back each other up) Well this time I just didn't want to keep my mouth shut 
Well hubs shouted at me that I shouldn't undermine him in front of our child. 

I snapped back, I said I was done with how he treats us when he stressed, we are not the bad guys and he cannot take his frustrations out on us, I told him to get out and leave us alone. he left for work then and we've not spoken since 

I've been for coffee with a friend and she thinks I was too harsh and that I should cut him some slack as he's in a stressful place with work. I'll admit I shouldn't have said about not shouting, as I went back on something we agreed on. I just hated seeing my LO cry because of it. I want to protect him. 

I don't really know how to handle the situation otherwise. I have spoken to hubs about this issue before and he always apologises and says he'll work on it. But I'm not seeing any change and don't know how to help this issue... But I won't have him taking work stress out on us as a family...",7,1730734085.0,AmItheAsshole,19,1.0,False

I’ll try to keep this brief. I (40m) have been talking to this girl (35f) for a month now. She lives about 2.5 hrs away. We share a hobby of ultra trail running which is how we met. She had a really hard divorce (her husband was a tool and got into a relationship while they were still married but separated). She split with him 2+ yrs ago and is still SUUUUPER guarded. 

After our first coffee she sent me a really nice text saying “thank you for pushing past my walls, I really enjoyed spending time with you” and some other pleasantries. 

The thing is she doesn’t ask many questions about me and isn’t generally inquisitive about me and my life. I can understand why, bc that would mean becoming vulnerable and close. 

we had a proper date tentatively planned which she couldn’t make happen but didn’t offer an alternative date. At that point I called it and explained it seems like you’re not interested or not ready for XYZ reasons. She said she didn’t mean to give that impression so I gave it another chance 

I have been extremely patient, responsive and available. The problem is my interest is really starting to wane at this point. Maybe I’m too available (the idea is being consistent and trying to earn her trust) and not creating enough dating tension.  

What’s the best way to proceed? Any advice?

Edit: she had that X factor for me that caught my attention and pulled me in. The thing you can’t describe about a person that pulls you. That’s why I’m pursuing but ultimately am starting to realize it’s not an optimal situation. ",0,1730734062.0,AskWomenOver30,9,0.17,False

However, by some miracle, I've connected with 3 other people in my area on Facebook who are also interested in creating some kind of coven or magical group together.

The problem is, we don't know how to get started. None of us have ever been in a coven before. There are no existing established groups within a 2 - 3 hour drive of us. Obviously we don't have some established tradition like Gardnerian wicca to draw from. I don't know if even a coven would be the right word, because I think we're all quite eclectic in our practices and not wanting to commit to something as narrow as wicca.

The big question is... for our first in-person meetup, what do we DO? Do we just jump right into it and hold a ritual out in the woods around a bonfire somewhere? If so, how do we decide on what ritual to do? Should we just meet up for coffee casually first? Do we start off with just a book club to get everyone on the same page with basics like LBRP etc? Wait and do something for one of the eight sabbats? Then how do we plan for the 2nd and 3rd meeting etc?

I see a lot of Youtube videos and blogs and Reddit posts about how to join a coven, what to expect when you join a coven, etc. But I think most of these assume you're joining an established group with a lineage who's already been at it for years.

I just wanted to write a quick post because I’m currently 2.5 days post treatment and experiencing some nasty symptoms, and I’m freaking out a bit. I’m also away from home on holiday, so I cannot talk to my usual GP (I asked and they said they can’t do consults for patients who are abroad).

I did triple therapy (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, omeprazole) for 7 days, taking my final dose Friday evening just gone (it’s now Monday afternoon/evening where I am). I had diarrhoea throughout the treatment, usually 4x per day, twice in the morning and twice in the evening. I wouldn’t say it was proper diarrhoea, but certainly looser than I’m used to.

After finishing I felt fine on Saturday and was looking forward to getting back to normal (and having some more solid poops!) but Sunday was a different story. I felt a tight, anxious feeling in my chest as soon as I had my morning coffee. I hoped it was just because I had drank it on an empty stomach, but heading out for food didn’t do anything to change it. I had a tight/anxious heartburn sensation all afternoon, and managed to find some Gaviscon in a pharmacy. I took that and felt better, so we headed out for some drinks in the city we’re visiting. We came home around 10pm and I got ready for bed, but was kept up all night with diarrhoea and acid reflux. Gaviscon wasn’t really helping. Today (Monday) I have been nauseous all day (strong smells are really setting me off) and have that roiling upset stomach feeling, though I don’t really have anything on my stomach to expel anymore. I was sick in the shower this morning but it was just foamy bile.

My GP texted me to suggest while I’m waiting to get home and get an appointment I can go back on omeprazole, which thankfully the pharmacy here also carried. I feel a little better but still so anxious. I was maybe naive but I thought finishing the treatment would leave me feeling better, but if anything the symptoms are just as intense as before but now with added diarrhoea.

I suppose I’m just hoping for some reassurance that this is normal, or any similar experiences which turned out fine. I’m really upset thinking it’s something worse (like stomach cancer) and that’s why the treatment hasn’t worked, and I can’t stop crying long enough to enjoy the time away with my husband.

hi so I am thinking of going on my first bike pack trip, with mostly what I own myself (a lot from mountain trekking). I am doing this on my TREK emonda SL7 road bike. but I do not know if the storage is sufficient. I am buying a 16Liter Deuter saddle bag, as it is quiet cheap online. and I have a backpack of 7Liter used for trail running.

i am good in making basic stuff out of metal and welding it so if I need something else I will just make it myself.

I will be bringing;

**handle bars**

\-A lightweight tent(nature hike cloud up 2) I was thinking of strapping this to my handlebars, I have it in a weatherproof bag already and make a small rack strapped to my bars.

**saddle bag (16Liters)**

\-sleeping bag(nomad lightweight mummy)

\-lightweight sleeping pad 

\-gas burner, 1 small pan/coffee cup combi, 300ml espresso maker - all attached to outside saddle bag with carabiner

\-lightweight warm downjacket + lightweight hiking pants + thermo shirt + underwear + socks(used for when I am not riding)

\-lightweight small towel 

\-running shoes(or other shoes), strapped to outside of saddle bag

**backpack (7liters)**

\-3,5Liter flask drinking pack, put into backpack

\-food(what I normally eat during training + dried food to make at gas stove and most importantly good coffee) put into backpack

\-utilities(toothbrush, multitool, headlight, first aid, spare tire, small tire pump, wallet, phone, earbuds, bike lock, electrical tape, toilet paper, disinfection gel, some rope, tie wraps, spork)

\-rain jacket

**bidon holders**

\-thinking just two 750ml bidons filled with water, as I am sleeping without utilities most likely I will bring as much water as possible.

\-sleeping pad also fits in here if saddle bag is too full. would use an extra strap to secure it.



most of the stuff I already own luckily from hiking in the mountains, normally everything would fit into my 50 Liter backpack. but I am just wondering if I am over estimating the amount of things I can fit into the saddle bag, and maybe I am forgetting something essential I need on this first 1 day trip to try out(obviously I have food and sleeping so I pretty safe)

I found alot of the frame bags online expensive so I am not yet buying one, also because in the future I will buy a hardtrail bike to go bikepacking so I do not know if it will fit. however I am thinking of making a compartment myself with some straps to the frame to maybe store something that would not fit into the saddle bag.

1gjghh9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjghh9,Obligatory Christmas BDC review,"Hi everyone,

I finally broke and bought the Christmas balmdot coms here are some swatches and my thoughts

I liked the packaging of both however I don't feel the silver lettering will hold up very long as I attempted to scratch it lightly and some marks did appear! This is such a shame as the metallic writing is really cute, the packaging colours are lovely I just wish biscotti was maybe paired with a different coloured cap but that's just my personal taste, the individual flavours feel wintery and autumnal but not overly Christmasy, I don't feel like I would want to wear these in spring or summer however the flavours don't scream its Christmas if that makes sense!

Biscotti: smells and tastes like sweet almond and nothing really else tbh I love it however i can see this giving a headache to people sensitive to smell, the tint leans on the cool light brown side and I find it really pretty, I would wear this paired with the Charlotte tilbury lip pencil in pillow talk, another mid pink shade or by itself! Whilst this shade works lovely on my pale skin and lips if you are a darker complexion I do feel like you would need a lip liner for this or that it may not show up as well which is annoying for a set product!

Expresso: Smells and tastes like overly sweet dalgona coffee from 2020, I didn't love this smell tbh however I don't love coffee scents in general! It gave a really strong cool brown tint to my lips that I'm not crazy about, I would wear this as a base to prep my lips form a darker berry shade like the storm cloud paint, or I would pair this with  dark red lip liner to create a vampy look, I do still prefer hot cocoa as a balm however and I would probably reach for that first which means that I will probably have to try panning this at some point!

My final thoughts is that I really liked biscotti and I might repurchase it separately from expresso again on a sale. I felt kinda meh towards expresso and I wouldn't repurchase this separately from biscotti again

I feel the set is good value for money and quite fun if you like the bdc, I would recommend them to anyone who likes cool browns and extremely strong and sweet smells, none of these scents make my top 5 bdc however and I wouldn't repurchase the set",10,1730732936.0,glossier,1,1.0,False

Instead, when set to an appropriate grind settting, I get a hum with no motor activation. To fix the problem, I turn to a coarser setting until the grinder functions again and then turn the dial to my preferred setting. I always turn towards finer grinding while the machine is in operation to avoid jams. This strategy works in the moment (at the expense of wasted coffee and extra time). Invariably when I attempt to grind my next shot, I get the same hum / no grind effect and the process repeats.

I’ve tried cleaning out the burrs and chute and have done the deep clean I’ve seen recommended here and on YouTube ([https://youtu.be/1iXylhTU\_-w?si=FfyZjIocX\_mvZ4nV](https://youtu.be/1iXylhTU_-w?si=FfyZjIocX_mvZ4nV)). I’ve even replaced the burrs. As far as I can tell, Eureka doesn’t have much customer support in the United States, so before replacing the machine I thought I’d come here for any ideas.

I figured I'd share what I learned with the class, and hopefully someone else can benefit or just have fun reading about it

To answer some of the questions from the last post:

If a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \~$600 CAD/$420 USD

Most Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e

Most Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4

Best Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range

Volkswagen ID.4: 5/10

This is the car version of vanilla ice cream. This is a car that uses energy to move wheels to get you places. This is a product you can purchase with money from selling your labour

There's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.

This is the car version of the paper they wrap spring rolls in. Thin nothingness. Maybe that was fine when it was one of the few EVs you could actually go out and buy during the shortage, but now? It's competing in a segment (crossover SUV thing) and price point (roughly $50-65k CAD) that is INCREDIBLY crowded at the moment

Infotainment is solidly okay, not awful like I've heard, but this 2024 is apparently the ""fixed"" version. Driving is boring, no feedback. The car feels like its off and just kinda gliding places, but not in a smooth luxury way. I don't know how to describe it other than it feels like what I thought a robotaxi would be, but you're actually driving the damn thing. Sterile.

If you are someone who always drives a Volkswagen, and you need a new car, this isn't something that will ruin your life. But is that what you want out of a car?

Audi Q4: 4/10

This EV suffers from Blazer syndrome; if you're already spending the money, reach for a Q6. If you want the same package, just get the ID.4. Otherwise, I feel like you're spending a lot more money for what it ultimately the same product

For example, a top trim ID.4 and a base trim Q4 are about the same price ($63,231 and $63,400 CAD, respectively), and here's what you have to pay to gain feature parity:

\~$5000 to upgrade to the 55 quattro, to match the ID.4 Pro S' HP

\~$6000 premium package to match the ID.4's memory seats, among others

\~$5000 package to match the ID.4's adaptive cruise control

That's fucking nuts. Yes, the Q4 feels nicer inside. Yes, it handles better (marginally). Yes, if you pay even more, you can get certain features that the ID.4 doesn't have, like the VR Hud and the hands free cruise control, which are nice.

Also, the ID.4 has ventilated seats. You can't even option ventilated seats on the Q4! What's with the German OEMs and their hate for this feature?

But I feel like its nowhere near nice ENOUGH to justify spending that money on it. If you really want one, upgrade to the Q6, whose feature set and range and general build quality, from what I've read, seems to be a league better. And I know that ""just spend more money lol"" isn't necessarily fair, but option for option, if you're buying (or more likely, leasing) a new car that's in the \~$75,000 range anyway, I really don't think that jumping to the \~$85,000 range will trouble you, unless you can't really afford the $75k car anyway

Volvo EX30: 6/10

I'm not even mad; I'm just confused

To get this out of the way; I fucking LOVE this car. Once it hits the used market and we move to a place with enough driveway space for 2 EVs to overnight charge, this will be mine. I want it over the i4, and I fucking loved that car.

It's so fucking fun to drive. It feels very light on its feet, like you're zipping around. On the updated twin motors of \~400+ horsepower (!) it feels like you're in a need for speed game (even when you're obeying the speed limit!). It reminds me most of a Golf GLI and then a Golf R, or maybe a Mini Cooper. This is the EV Golf that Volkswagen should be making; a fun but practical family car, and then an absurdly hot hatch in the form of the twin motor. And all that fun was before I turned traction control off!

I'll also say that this is the smoothest implementation of regen braking I've had in a car. Absolutely peak, better than the previous winners of Tesla and BMW

The interior is very funky, in a way that activates my Spreadsheet brain. It's absolutely cost cutting, but honestly? It's still a nice place to be. At first I thought it'd feel way worse, because it had reverse Hyundai Effect (where their materials look nice but feel bad). The flecked plastic looked cheap, but when you're actually in it, it doesn't feel that bad.

The materials are certainly nowhere near as good as the S60 or XC60, but they still felt wayyy better than an average economy car. They look interesting, they feel interesting/pretty good. The seats remain incredible, even if not quite as good as their more expensive cousins

Like I said, everything feels like it was designed with purpose. Most buttons pull double duty, the screen is how you do everything, but the infotainment is snappy, and designed in a very logical way. No Menu hell like the EQE

But that's the issue; it's a cost cutting vehicle... for fucking *$57,000 CAD!* ($41,000 USD). That's fucking absurd. This is supposed to be their entry level car, and it's more expensive than their gas XC40. It's more expensive than a base model XC60! Which is far larger and nicer. This car could do extremely well in Canada; I see Golfs and mazda 3s rolling around all the time. Priced a bit less (but still more) and Volvo could sell it well. But they're not, and why? This car goes against their move to being luxury, but in this case, why make it?

And of course, I follow the Chinese market. This car is the less luxury version of its sister car, the Zeekr X! So don't give me any bullshit about ""oh we needed to cut costs : ("" [when the Zeekr X exists](https://www.datocms-assets.com/128969/1713875719-zeekrx_interior_main2_tab.jpg?auto=format), built in the same goddamn factory and sold for the same price in China (roughly $35,000 CAD).

To paraphrase a German: I say this full of admiration for the EX30. I love it, I love it very much. But I love it against my better judgement

I am probably the demographic it was made from. I'm a young white collar professional who works in a boring industry, I compared these with spreadsheets, I consider Chinese design to be a positive instead of a negative for an EV, and I have awful fashion sense. If I'm hesitant about it, how well is it going to sell for a random 50 year old crosshopping it with an XC40?

Ford Mustang Mach-e: 8/10

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER. This is the car my wife settled for.

There's a lot to like here; this car handles quite well for an SUV. It's no sports car, it's no Mustang. But you know, everyone knows the arguments now, so I won't get into it other than to say I will only call it a mach e

Interior wise, the big ass tablet is kind of lame, but I feel like it's laid out in a logic fashion. It's response, it's fine, the wheel for volume makes a nice clicky sound when you use it, which pleases me. The turn signal noise sounds like horse hooves clicking. It satisfies my lizard brain. The materials aren't necessarily better than competition, but like the EX30, it's what you do with it that counts. They're laid out very nicely, everything feels and looks interesting, etc

Driving feel is very American. Not necessarily super feedbacky, but you definitely don't feel this thing's weight around corners. I mean again, it's an SUV at the end of the day. But you can tell that Ford was REALLY trying here

It also is nice that it doesn't make eco mode feel like a penalty box. Really, Ford, Kia-Hyundai, Tesla, and Volvo are an odd coalition that makes you think that eco mode is how they expect you to drive it, and make that mode as nice and reasonable as possible

So why not a 10/10? If this is what we're buying, and we both love it, why an 8?

Well, it's because we're buying one used. New? This car is simply not cost competitive. It is, for sure, a better car than the Equinox or Blazer from Chevrolet, or the Model Y from Tesla. It is simply not nearly $10,000 better

You can get any GM product for less, with more range. Oh, and they usually feel a bit bigger inside. Tesla is worse inside for the Y, but likewise you get native NACS, better range, and lower prices

Used, however? We're going to be picking up a 2021 Mach-e Premium extended range for $33,000 CAD sticker. That's more than 50% depreciation, for a vehicle with less than 30,000 kilometres on it. That's fucking NUTS, and good value

There are, theoretically, Mach-es that get in the same price, but the small battery is both short of range for not a big discount, and also unicorn tier rare. We can custom order one from the factory according to Ford, but one in the wild already made? Nah.

Chevrolet Silverado EV: 10/10

The letter to keep in mind for the Silverado EV is ""C""

The first C is for Cavernous: its a full sized truck, but this is by far one of the most spacious vehicles I've been in, ever. Almost felt like more space than an Escalade. It's about the same size as an ICE Silverado, but holy shit. I genuinely felt like a kid who had climbed into his dad's truck. In the backseat, I felt like I was in a movie theatre

The second C is for Cheap. I sat in the work truck (base) model and actually drove the fully loaded one; night and fucking day. I swear there's a prototype WT trim out there with hand cranked windows. The smell of plastic was nausiated, and it was covered in what was genuinely one of the worst feeling fake leathers I've had the misfortunate of sitting in. Hard plastic galore

So yeah, this is a truck that's basically required to be purchased above base trim. Hell, if I was in the jury for a trial of a workman who beat his boss' ass for buying this for him, I would find him not guilty regardless of evidence

But otherwise... as someone who likes sedans, I felt dread driving this, because it was awesome. This is a Truck without *any* of the traditional downsides of owning a truck. Still body on frame, so it wasn't like it was perfect, but it felt far nicer than any truck I've driven before (besides the lightning). It felt peppy, and didn't feel like I was dragging a full sized truck around. It felt far more like an SUV than a truck

Likewise, cost of fuel; napkin math says that I should be able to get \~773 kilometres with the top trim gas engine (which, according to C&D, is actually more efficient than the 4 cyl, common 4 banger L). That needs premium fuel, so for the 90 litre tank at $1.85 a litre of 93, is \~$166, or 22 cents a kilometre

Compare that to the RST, with \~708 kilometres of range from a battery that appears to be 205 kwh. At my overnight rate of $0.08 a kwh, I'd cost me $16.40 to charge, for a cost of 2.3 cents a kilometre

But there is a range, of course. Assuming you charge from zero to full at an average Tesla charger, you're going to pay $98.40 for a full ""tank"". Still cheaper, but less so

But then my province also offers a super low overnight rate of $0.023 kwh, knocking the Silverado down to being recharged for $5.74. For two coffees at tims, you can get 708 kilometres of range. Insane

All that being said, I expect trucks to SIGNIFICANTLY increase in popularity as time goes on

Lexus RZ: 7/10

I'll probably get some flack for this, given that this and the Bzwhatever is the most hated car other than the cybertruck, but I thought that this was a pretty decent car

It feels like a Lexus, Electric. If you like Lexus, then you will like this car. Given the talk about it, I actually though the specs would be far worse. But the one I drove got an EPA range of \~430 kilometres, with a max charging speed of 147 kws

And you know what? That's *fine.* Would I buy this car? Not right now, because it'll be used on regular \~550 kilometre roadtrips, but if I didn't? Very strong contender

It felt very nice inside, probably among the most comfortable after the various Volvos. Infotainment was solidly okay, nothing to write home about. It felt a bit slow on the highway, but like, who cares?

This is a car for people who are 50-80 years old, who have always bought Japanese, who want something nice in their golden years, who will go on a roadtrip of maybe 300 kilometres to get on a plane to get sunburnt at an all inclusive in Barbados. Essentially, this is a car made in a lab for My Father. So thank you Lexus!",1,1730732563.0,cars,1,1.0,False

I figured I'd share what I learned with the class, and hopefully someone else can benefit or just have fun reading about it

To answer some of the questions from the last post:

If a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \~$600 CAD/$420 USD

Most Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e

Most Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4

Best Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range

Volkswagen ID.4: 5/10

This is the car version of vanilla ice cream. This is a car that uses energy to move wheels to get you places. This is a product you can purchase with money from selling your labour

There's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.

This is the car version of the paper they wrap spring rolls in. Thin nothingness. Maybe that was fine when it was one of the few EVs you could actually go out and buy during the shortage, but now? It's competing in a segment (crossover SUV thing) and price point (roughly $50-65k CAD) that is INCREDIBLY crowded at the moment

Infotainment is solidly okay, not awful like I've heard, but this 2024 is apparently the ""fixed"" version. Driving is boring, no feedback. The car feels like its off and just kinda gliding places, but not in a smooth luxury way. I don't know how to describe it other than it feels like what I thought a robotaxi would be, but you're actually driving the damn thing. Sterile.

If you are someone who always drives a Volkswagen, and you need a new car, this isn't something that will ruin your life. But is that what you want out of a car?

Audi Q4: 4/10

This EV suffers from Blazer syndrome; if you're already spending the money, reach for a Q6. If you want the same package, just get the ID.4. Otherwise, I feel like you're spending a lot more money for what it ultimately the same product

For example, a top trim ID.4 and a base trim Q4 are about the same price ($63,231 and $63,400 CAD, respectively), and here's what you have to pay to gain feature parity:

\~$5000 to upgrade to the 55 quattro, to match the ID.4 Pro S' HP

\~$6000 premium package to match the ID.4's memory seats, among others

\~$5000 package to match the ID.4's adaptive cruise control

That's fucking nuts. Yes, the Q4 feels nicer inside. Yes, it handles better (marginally). Yes, if you pay even more, you can get certain features that the ID.4 doesn't have, like the VR Hud and the hands free cruise control, which are nice.

Also, the ID.4 has ventilated seats. You can't even option ventilated seats on the Q4! What's with the German OEMs and their hate for this feature?

But I feel like its nowhere near nice ENOUGH to justify spending that money on it. If you really want one, upgrade to the Q6, whose feature set and range and general build quality, from what I've read, seems to be a league better. And I know that ""just spend more money lol"" isn't necessarily fair, but option for option, if you're buying (or more likely, leasing) a new car that's in the \~$75,000 range anyway, I really don't think that jumping to the \~$85,000 range will trouble you, unless you can't really afford the $75k car anyway

Volvo EX30: 6/10

I'm not even mad; I'm just confused

To get this out of the way; I fucking LOVE this car. Once it hits the used market and we move to a place with enough driveway space for 2 EVs to overnight charge, this will be mine. I want it over the i4, and I fucking loved that car.

It's so fucking fun to drive. It feels very light on its feet, like you're zipping around. On the updated twin motors of \~400+ horsepower (!) it feels like you're in a need for speed game (even when you're obeying the speed limit!). It reminds me most of a Golf GLI and then a Golf R, or maybe a Mini Cooper. This is the EV Golf that Volkswagen should be making; a fun but practical family car, and then an absurdly hot hatch in the form of the twin motor. And all that fun was before I turned traction control off!

I'll also say that this is the smoothest implementation of regen braking I've had in a car. Absolutely peak, better than the previous winners of Tesla and BMW

The interior is very funky, in a way that activates my Spreadsheet brain. It's absolutely cost cutting, but honestly? It's still a nice place to be. At first I thought it'd feel way worse, because it had reverse Hyundai Effect (where their materials look nice but feel bad). The flecked plastic looked cheap, but when you're actually in it, it doesn't feel that bad.

The materials are certainly nowhere near as good as the S60 or XC60, but they still felt wayyy better than an average economy car. They look interesting, they feel interesting/pretty good. The seats remain incredible, even if not quite as good as their more expensive cousins

Like I said, everything feels like it was designed with purpose. Most buttons pull double duty, the screen is how you do everything, but the infotainment is snappy, and designed in a very logical way. No Menu hell like the EQE

But that's the issue; it's a cost cutting vehicle... for fucking *$57,000 CAD!* ($41,000 USD). That's fucking absurd. This is supposed to be their entry level car, and it's more expensive than their gas XC40. It's more expensive than a base model XC60! Which is far larger and nicer. This car could do extremely well in Canada; I see Golfs and mazda 3s rolling around all the time. Priced a bit less (but still more) and Volvo could sell it well. But they're not, and why? This car goes against their move to being luxury, but in this case, why make it?

And of course, I follow the Chinese market. This car is the less luxury version of its sister car, the Zeekr X! So don't give me any bullshit about ""oh we needed to cut costs : ("" [when the Zeekr X exists](https://www.datocms-assets.com/128969/1713875719-zeekrx_interior_main2_tab.jpg?auto=format), built in the same goddamn factory and sold for the same price in China (roughly $35,000 CAD).

To paraphrase a German: I say this full of admiration for the EX30. I love it, I love it very much. But I love it against my better judgement

I am probably the demographic it was made from. I'm a young white collar professional who works in a boring industry, I compared these with spreadsheets, I consider Chinese design to be a positive instead of a negative for an EV, and I have awful fashion sense. If I'm hesitant about it, how well is it going to sell for a random 50 year old crosshopping it with an XC40?

Ford Mustang Mach-e: 8/10

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER. This is the car my wife settled for.

There's a lot to like here; this car handles quite well for an SUV. It's no sports car, it's no Mustang. But you know, everyone knows the arguments now, so I won't get into it other than to say I will only call it a mach e

Interior wise, the big ass tablet is kind of lame, but I feel like it's laid out in a logic fashion. It's response, it's fine, the wheel for volume makes a nice clicky sound when you use it, which pleases me. The turn signal noise sounds like horse hooves clicking. It satisfies my lizard brain. The materials aren't necessarily better than competition, but like the EX30, it's what you do with it that counts. They're laid out very nicely, everything feels and looks interesting, etc

Driving feel is very American. Not necessarily super feedbacky, but you definitely don't feel this thing's weight around corners. I mean again, it's an SUV at the end of the day. But you can tell that Ford was REALLY trying here

It also is nice that it doesn't make eco mode feel like a penalty box. Really, Ford, Kia-Hyundai, Tesla, and Volvo are an odd coalition that makes you think that eco mode is how they expect you to drive it, and make that mode as nice and reasonable as possible

So why not a 10/10? If this is what we're buying, and we both love it, why an 8?

Well, it's because we're buying one used. New? This car is simply not cost competitive. It is, for sure, a better car than the Equinox or Blazer from Chevrolet, or the Model Y from Tesla. It is simply not nearly $10,000 better

You can get any GM product for less, with more range. Oh, and they usually feel a bit bigger inside. Tesla is worse inside for the Y, but likewise you get native NACS, better range, and lower prices

Used, however? We're going to be picking up a 2021 Mach-e Premium extended range for $33,000 CAD sticker. That's more than 50% depreciation, for a vehicle with less than 30,000 kilometres on it. That's fucking NUTS, and good value

There are, theoretically, Mach-es that get in the same price, but the small battery is both short of range for not a big discount, and also unicorn tier rare. We can custom order one from the factory according to Ford, but one in the wild already made? Nah.

Chevrolet Silverado EV: 10/10

The letter to keep in mind for the Silverado EV is ""C""

The first C is for Cavernous: its a full sized truck, but this is by far one of the most spacious vehicles I've been in, ever. Almost felt like more space than an Escalade. It's about the same size as an ICE Silverado, but holy shit. I genuinely felt like a kid who had climbed into his dad's truck. In the backseat, I felt like I was in a movie theatre

The second C is for Cheap. I sat in the work truck (base) model and actually drove the fully loaded one; night and fucking day. I swear there's a prototype WT trim out there with hand cranked windows. The smell of plastic was nausiated, and it was covered in what was genuinely one of the worst feeling fake leathers I've had the misfortunate of sitting in. Hard plastic galore

So yeah, this is a truck that's basically required to be purchased above base trim. Hell, if I was in the jury for a trial of a workman who beat his boss' ass for buying this for him, I would find him not guilty regardless of evidence

But otherwise... as someone who likes sedans, I felt dread driving this, because it was awesome. This is a Truck without *any* of the traditional downsides of owning a truck. Still body on frame, so it wasn't like it was perfect, but it felt far nicer than any truck I've driven before (besides the lightning). It felt peppy, and didn't feel like I was dragging a full sized truck around. It felt far more like an SUV than a truck

Likewise, cost of fuel; napkin math says that I should be able to get \~773 kilometres with the top trim gas engine (which, according to C&D, is actually more efficient than the 4 cyl, common 4 banger L). That needs premium fuel, so for the 90 litre tank at $1.85 a litre of 93, is \~$166, or 22 cents a kilometre

Compare that to the RST, with \~708 kilometres of range from a battery that appears to be 205 kwh. At my overnight rate of $0.08 a kwh, I'd cost me $16.40 to charge, for a cost of 2.3 cents a kilometre

But there is a range, of course. Assuming you charge from zero to full at an average Tesla charger, you're going to pay $98.40 for a full ""tank"". Still cheaper, but less so

But then my province also offers a super low overnight rate of $0.023 kwh, knocking the Silverado down to being recharged for $5.74. For two coffees at tims, you can get 708 kilometres of range. Insane

All that being said, I expect trucks to SIGNIFICANTLY increase in popularity as time goes on

Lexus RZ: 7/10

I'll probably get some flack for this, given that this and the Bzwhatever is the most hated car other than the cybertruck, but I thought that this was a pretty decent car

It feels like a Lexus, Electric. If you like Lexus, then you will like this car. Given the talk about it, I actually though the specs would be far worse. But the one I drove got an EPA range of \~430 kilometres, with a max charging speed of 147 kws

And you know what? That's *fine.* Would I buy this car? Not right now, because it'll be used on regular \~550 kilometre roadtrips, but if I didn't? Very strong contender

It felt very nice inside, probably among the most comfortable after the various Volvos. Infotainment was solidly okay, nothing to write home about. It felt a bit slow on the highway, but like, who cares?

This is a car for people who are 50-80 years old, who have always bought Japanese, who want something nice in their golden years, who will go on a roadtrip of maybe 300 kilometres to get on a plane to get sunburnt at an all inclusive in Barbados. Essentially, this is a car made in a lab for My Father. So thank you Lexus!",27,1730731894.0,electricvehicles,29,0.78,False

Hello,
I am writing this to try and get some perspective on my situation. I (25m) just got married to (25f) a couple weeks ago. We have a really good relationship. We have have no kids, a great sex life and are completely financially stable, the big things to argue about aren’t there. We still argue a lot, the thing we argue about most is her step mom and dad. They have not accepted me since day one, it took her four months to even introduce me to them because they didn’t like her last boyfriend.  Shortly after being introduced, she moved in with me. As far as I remember, she let them know by text. I’m not sure what they thought about us moving together, but I have an idea because shortly after moving in, her step mom bought tickets for everyone to go to a concert except me. She has consistently left me out of things. She has talked about how she plans to have vacations without me, only inviting my wife after we’re married.(in fairness this was walked back). Even through our engagement process, she kept so far away, rarely asking about things or helping us. It was just weird, and I know that her own daughter will not get that same treatment when she gets married. Anyway, we have had arguments about all of this, but this past week, we have been arguing all week. My wife and her dad’s team was in the World Series. My MIL bought my FIL tickets to 2 games in the World Series and he got mad my wife wasn’t invited, it almost led to them divorcing. We didn’t see it, but it sounds bad. IMO, after two days, this was swept under the rug. One day later, one of our own TVs wouldn’t let my wife finish the game and so I invite her down to watch on a split screen, since my favorite team was also playing that night. The next morning I help wake her up because she cause she struggles in the morning and she has an attitude. I tell her, it’s not okay for her to have an attitude because I am being nice waking you up and making you coffee and breakfast and even the night before putting the game in split screen so you can watch the end of your game while I also watch my favorite team. She tells me this is bottom of the barrel and I didn’t go above and beyond at all, barely meeting her expectations. This is frustrating given her dad’s own behavior that week and historically, that she sweeps under the rug. So, im asking, am I the issue here? And, if not, what can be done as when I bring this up, she defends her dad and says I am wrong.",2,1730731591.0,inlaws,3,0.63,False

I work in FnB and recently there is this new girl who just joined us who after 1 or 2 days started to talk to me more and more overtime . I took it as simply she was asking me questions so I just answers when she asked . Then on the third day she started hanging out around my station (I am at the food window so I don't usually move too far from post while she's a waitress so she's supposed to move around alot) and one of the days  during some down time she came up next to me and started just striking up a conversation with me and a few times (this is where I think I'm overthinking) she would brush her shoulders with mine and I would do my best not to flinch or pull away cuz I was scared that I was too close to her like I was invading her personal space and I could not tell you what was said there cuz FnB very noisy and we had 1 ear plugged for crew communication . Not only that we spoke in my second language which isn't very strong so I would frequently ask her to repeat which is also killing me from the inside (There's also the one time I asked her a question , she replied and I acknowledged that I heard her answer , just to realize I have no idea what she said but I couldn't ask her again cuz I'm awkward like that ). But yesterday when we went on break she asked me where I was going to eat and followed me to get the food I got and after that break she offered to buy me coffee with her expiring coupons . And during that night we were on early shift so she asked if I was heading off and I told her I was staying for dinner first to which she said she would come too but when we were leaving she ended up staying abit longer so I left on my own . If this was a regular day without the coffee stuff I would have just brushed it off . But her changing her mind on leaving got me to second guess and her choosing to leave after me got me triple guessing . I'm also terrified that I'm actually overthinking it and she's just treating me like a friend and I don't know if I should keep some distance between us or she does want to have a closer relationship.

He is used to being in a soft-sided carrier and going on car rides (including a car ride that lasted one hour). He is also somewhat used to wearing a harness and leash, and riding in a stroller outside—I take him on walks in parks and to my local coffee shop sometimes. He’s very friendly and not fearful of people, he is used to meeting and being around lots of people. However, he does get restless if he isn’t able to be out of his stroller or carrier after about 15-20 minutes. He doesn’t get physically agitated, just starts meowing and putting his paws on the sides of the carrier. Usually, I am able to either let him out on his leash (if we are on a walk outdoors) or just speak to him calmly and tell him we’re almost home, sometimes I sing to him in the car when he’s getting vocal and I can tell he wants out of his carrier. However, sometimes he doesn’t stop meowing until we get home (could be on and off meowing for 20ish minutes). Later this month, I am taking him on a plane to visit my family in my hometown. The flight is a little under 2 hours and I’ve already got most things prepared in terms of adding him to my trip and paying the pet fee with the airline, getting his vaccine records, etc. But I need some advice about how to travel with a young cat who has never been in an airport before, how to make sure he is as comfortable as possible, and what to do about his meowing in the airport/on the plane.

\*\*\*TL;DR IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS... WILL NOTE IN ALL CAPS THE END OF THE TL;DR AND BEGINNING OF FLUFF/DETAILS/ELABORATION\*\*\*

I swear on our holy Father and both of my parents' graves that each time I have presented the following analogy to a stranger with time to spare or a caring acquaintance distant enough from my personal life that I feel exposing such an existential and insurmountably grand problem as my not being a caliber of person large enough to realize my destiny and grab life by the horns won't come back to bite me, they've all been perplexed…

A vetted and respected record producer friend in his 60s (who I might hope would agree withand understand my referring to him as a father figure) kind of saw the writing on the wall that my coming off of a music career hiatus nearly a decade long might cause me trouble more than six months ago told me at the time that I need a life coach, and, on the same note, as I understand it , here are also counselors who specialize in career advice just like there are counselors that specialize in couples or anger management-

If you, dear reader, believe best answer simply lies in the above paragraph, to rephrase it in more deliberate terms that I might have to hire somebody to help my spoiled man child archetype to grow the heck up, then I'm sorry to have wasted this much of your time then I will gladly take your down vote and accompanying browser back page click as a signal blatant enough, but I believe most people have solved similar problems without committing money and weekly scheduled time on top of bills that seem to increase in size without hesitation... I often wonder if I am slightly on the Asperger's side of the autism spectrum disorder, but no counselor I have met with during my two recent-ish rehab stays agrees with this sentiment.

Anyways, onto this analogy which keeps dumping people– I believe I am experiencing somethings similar to the age-old predicament of an athlete attending college on a scholarship who can't make the grades to stay on the team which they need to stay on to maintain their scholarship...  Just existing as a person who doesn't have the aptitude in certain necessary personality facets to garner the motivation or drive to realize their True potential as a scholar in their field of interest and talented athlete in the support they desire to own undeniably existing skills in.

\*\*\*WOW, THAT WAS A LENGTHY FAILURE OF A TL;DR, WASM'T IT? MY APOLOGIES...\*\*\*

It could be effortlessly argued that the long winded and whimsical disposition and voice I have already exhibited to you, dear reader, therein lies a large chunk of the problem- to be fully candid, since recently deciding to outsource my mix and master (which I don't feel insecure about in the slightest, since many artists and producers who even have the experience and knowledge I lack to get a pop or EDM track clean and loud enough for labels to respond favorably to a demo submission STILL outsource their master when they don't have the necessary gear or schedule to polish their own tracks), I have already had two mastering engineers fire me from their client roster just due to my exposing too much of my neurotic personality in trying to foster an earnest business partnership haha.

""Biting off more than I can chew"", as stated in this post title, basically means that in choosing to restart my career as a composer and producer, I have chosen to attack the project by evolving myself from a bedroom electronic DJ/producer into an actual record producer in the traditional sense of the term by assembling a roster of recording artists, fostering relationships with sound designers who supply loops, learning how to appropriately buss tracks and run them back through analog gear for an impressive final product, moreover building relationships with engineers who can afford such gear, picking the brains of friends and acquaintances with management prowess over late night cups of coffee, restarting my personal imprint on YouTube which is still network-partnered after more than 5 years of inactivity, and excepting requests to get involved with events companies run by respectable booking agents, along with more tasks this community is all too familiar with......

......The prompt success of which (people say my beats are better than I give myself credit for and that I'm an alright enough guy to spend time with and entrust elements their hopes and dreams to (would love to share some upcoming tracks with anyone curious enough by the end of by the end of this lengthy read)) left me with:

1. A fiancée, PERSON A, (who is, mind you dear reader, so loving and benevolent that she has finally chosen to follow in her mothers footsteps of becoming a vocalist and performing artist for the sole purpose of helping me out and supporting my dreams) becoming visibly depressed when presented with a cold bad night after night due to my burning the midnight oil on virtual business meetings and developing beats that meet my artists' specifications
2. Long time friends who have supported me in my life endeavors and recovery from drug addiction (I am blessed enough to say a few of whiom are even respected and established music industry professionals who played integral parts in developing my musical skills and presence in the public eye during my first 4-year presence in the industry as an adolescent all those years ago) disappointed in my snubbing their attempts to reach out or failing to develop plans to spend time together as I am so constantly distracted, folded, crumbled, or what have you, by the tasks outlined in the above paragraphs.
3. An undeniable and blatant failure to complete everyday tasks such as unpacking the remainder of my family's belongings into a new house we moved into a whopping 15 months ago, tackling projects with my new accountant as my previous one retired, daily household chores and spending playtime with my loving pets, processing feelings about the untimely deaths of both my parents less than a handful of years ago, coming into my own as an adult who doesn't squander the life's work the aforementioned deceased parents so generously left to their only child, and just stopping to smell the roses with the goal of lowering the concentration of cortisol coursing through my veins...
4. A flagship songwriter and performing artist of my camp, PERSON B, whom I spend a lot of time with as of recent, developing a big brother (he's 7 years my senior), relationship with me the likes of which has him feeling like he can liberally voice concerns about my life choices, finances, and immaturity to his girlfriend, PERSON C, (I believe this girlfriend of his is my camp's most talented songwriter and recording artist, again a friend so loving that she's decided to start a hobby as an artist to help me out, akin to my fiancee) and my fiancee herself at every one of many frequent occasions where he's sauced up on whatever the drug cocktail of the day is... Despite the fact that myself, PERSON A, and PERSON C  all agreeing behind closed doors that he is throwing pretty heavy rocks from a considerably thin glass house, PERSON B's words, understandably, have enough truth in them to put a strain on my relationship with all three of them (all three friends mentioned in this paragraph are at least 4 years my senior).

I'm halfway across the USA with PERSON A visiting  PERSON B and PERSON C  on business currently, the dealings and projects of which they're chipping away at during the rare hours they're not mentally and physically cooked by their day jobs... PERSON Bt has so generously introduced me to his childhood friend who is a university graduate of composition, design, and engineering respected in the magical world of modern Soul/RnB, PERSON D, (PERSON Bt does not have the time, reputation, nor credentials to work with this childhood friend of his, but I I've been given the exciting and honorary privilege of mitigating this sticky situation of shortcomings for PERSON B despite my not being classically trained).

MY LIFE IS SO BLATANTLY MELTING INTO AN UNRECOGNIZABLE MESS THAT.... Despite PERSON A and I having our initial meeting with this PERSON D yesterday for four hours, the last hour of which PERSON B was able to join us , spending the time talking shop, conducting a think tank on how to progress the careers of this talented camp which I have assembled, and showing each other our biggest releases and favorite tracks, having some cognac, all of which culminated in this new friend of mine, PERSON D, whom I had only spent four hours and a couple phone calls with, yelling down the driveway that he loves me as I am leaving and my responding that I definitely believe in love at first sight whether it be a new friend or a love interest.... and despite PERSON D later texting PERSON B that he believes I'm a good person with a heart in the right place and ideas that he, PERSON B, should believe in, invest in, and follow through with as best he can,

PERSON A, who admittedly always assumes the worst, sometimes even despite tangible evidence otherwise, told me on the way to the hotel that she believes PERSON D,  whom we spent the entire afternoon with, was lying in that text and that in reality I made a bad impression by not being super professional and locking in on the digital audio workstation first thing after I shook his hand and accepted his invitation into his house and studio...

Hours earlier, whenPERSON C, who had agreed with me the previous day that I am far too neurotic and weird of a person and I would totally blow it with PERSON D upon our first meeting, asked us how it went, I, for the third time that day, asked PERSON A and PERSON B for a reaffirmation that they did indeed believe that things went well and that PERSON D is excited to work with me...

PERSON C responded  to me that during a FaceTime with PERSON B during PERSON C's shift, the context of PERSON D's text was revealed to her far earlier than it was to me...  Then an hour later PERSON B is sauced up on God knows what, tearing into me for being a directionless oaf who would fare best by taking some of my parents' fortune and opening a business that made money off of one of PERSON A's many culinary talents.

Fort all I know PERSON A is using her persistent doom-and-gloom outlook to discourage me into giving up on this music career reboot  that leaves her bed cold as I work all night, resulting in my doubling down on my day job...

For all I know, PERSON D actually sent a negative text to PERSON B regarding his impression of me, and that all three of these artists in my camp agreed behind closed doors to not mention it to me... I mean it makes no sense to me that PERSON A and PERSON B would  thrice confirm to me that i put on a good show for PERSON D, PERSON D would and did make sure to schedule our first recording session for this very next day before PERSON C  even got off work last night,

but then the night ended with yet two more long-winded, disillusioning, and stern lectures from PERSON A and PERSON B about like... I guess... my consistent failure to rise to any given occasion or ever make a good/responsible/respectable choice in any given situation...

Feels llke that recent story where the Warner executive axed that Roadrunner & Coyote movie that polled well with all of the focus groups that viewed it despite the movie purportedly succeeding at what few opportunities it was given in its infancy....

Well... Thanks for reading... The sun is rising to end yet another sleepless night for our story's valiant protagonist, a night void of cuddles for his lonely and fed-up fiancee, an acute withdrawal from God knows what kinda stuff for the exuberant flagship artist, a few hours of sleep gathered by his girlfriend who grows more weary each day of her boyfriend and his producer/manager/handler's boisterous and obnoxiously loud Dumb-and-Dumber schtick, and begin a new work day for one of RnB's most promising young producers who hopefully just now made the vibration in our neurotically wordy main character's pocket, else it be angry withdrawing flagship artist or our hero's soul mate wondering why he spent the night on the hotel's patio chainsmoking about his life situation...

1gjfpak,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gjfpak/i_am_a_pizza_delivery_guy_thats_lost_in_the_bush/,I am a pizza delivery guy that's lost in the bush.,"It may sound strange, but I have been delivering this pizza for three hours now.

 

 

I think I am going crazy, It started as normal as it can get: a ticket coming from one of the regular food delivery apps, requesting two large pizzas to a street no more than six minutes from our business. Having our shop on the far outer suburbs meant we weren't strangers to deliveries that would dip into the country, far from it. I could regale you with a million times I had delivered to a massive property where I got to pet a horse, or a cow, or an alpaca, it was how ordinary this order was that initially shielded me from my concern.

 

Three doors down from one of our regulars, an easy delivery, I thought to myself as my car rolled itself out of the driveway next to our shop, I didn’t think for a second that the house was more than a regular order, maybe some stoned teenagers left alone at their rich family's mansion over the weekend, but nothing I hadn't seen a million times. Even turning on the street, I was met with the same thing I had been met with a million times; Trees, the calls of magpies and kookaburras, and the cacophony of a million crickets chirruping en masse as if to entirely overwhelm my sense of hearing. It took little more than five minutes of driving, with me thinking that if I could take it slow, I might be able to sneak a cigarette on the way back. Before I knew it though, I was faced with the driveway; A narrow path of dirt and gravel that slowly inched its way into the dense bush and trees Infront of me. As I lowered my music, to focus on my driving, I turned into the driveway; It dipped into a valley and I could see the worn tracks of tires run down and then up into a large group of trees, with nothing but the idea of a tip, or maybe a cute farmer on my mind I thought only of moving forward and shifted my Ute into a lower gear to tackle the muddy and dirty track.

 

As my car pulled into the valley at the bottom I watched the track fade into the cluster of trees, I thought nothing of it as I recalled my Hilux burning through mud paths far more treacherous than this and that one time a few friends and I drove far into the Styx up in the mountain ranges, I pulled into second gear to climb the hill and I felt my car shudder. Had anyone else been driving it may have seemed like a quirk of my cars clutch, but I felt something else; It was as if my car was shivering, feeling something that I couldn’t feel yet, and as I corrected the gearstick the shadows of the trees on the other side of the valley drowned out the light, forcing me to turn on my headlights.

 

It seemed as if the track was far too long and that I should have reconnected to the nearest road; one that I was familiar with, due to a regular with an adorable pug that would chase me down to get to the pizza before their owner. But as I trekked on, still not totally disconcerted by the ever-encompassing dark, I began to look for the break in the trees that would usually allow for the emergence of the house.

 

The trees loomed too high, the track too straight. Had this have been logical I would have been by the house by now, or at least an intersection to soothe my beating heart, to let me know the road is ending. Still the driveway seemed to take me between trees for longer than I could imagine. It had been almost ten minutes until the radio played the stupid joke song I had set as my ringtone, it was my boss. I immediately answered and spoke, hoping to get help from someone who was my superior.

 

""Keep going Carl, these people need their food,"" I heard, before I could even open my mouth to complain about this awful road that I had been on. I still had the sense within me to roll my eyes at the nickname my boss had given me. Something so close to my name, but something wrong that my boss could pronounce with his deep accent.

""Their driveway is awful if I find a spot I am going to turn around and come home, it's not possible,"" I said, hoping my boss would do as he usually does and take my side with matters regarding customers. I heard a pause far too long over the line and was met with a phrase that almost froze my blood;

""They were promised a meal,"" The sound of a dead phone line met me after that and shocked me, my boss was never one to hang up on me and was someone who would usually take my side. I could not understand why he was so determined to have me deliver these pizzas. The phone line faded my phones music kicked back in, some terrible song from the 90's.

 

I shrugged and moved on, my car roaring loud as I over revved the clutch to climb the small hill in front of me, the trees seeming to swallow all of the dimming sunlight the late December sun could throw on my evening delivery.

It seemed so normal, that it was only when I snubbed out a cigarette into the old coffee jar in my console that I realised that I had been on this path for almost 10 minutes, taking me far into where the nearest town should be, and when looking at my GPS, said I was only 100 meters from the road I turned off of.

  
I'm sitting on a road that every map says is twenty meters above a river half a suburb away, typing this all out. I don’t know if it's all a glitch of my phone and Navman's GPS but I feel as if somethings wrong. Why can't I see the sun? It was supposed to be bright for another two hours but all I can see is the darkness of the moonlight sky in the very small gaps in the trees, and all I can hear is crickets. I will take off in a moment, a delivery is a delivery, but if you have any ideas, please let me know.

 

Thanks,

I’m in my mid life crisis I feel na parang ang daming binabato sakin ngayun ng universe sa isip isip ko kanina parang puro problema puro pain. so I decided not to go home muna and treat myself kahit papaano kahit kape at tinapay lang. I sat in a coffee shop, nakatulaa tumitingin sa mga nakasulat na pagkain, this guy next to me ask if what will i be having, so right away tinuro ko kung ano gusto ko and I sat down sa upuan nila sa labas. Pumunta yung waiter and gave me my order then asked “kamusta ka na?” so napatingin ako sa kanya and with confusion in my face he said “I was your high school batch mate” and still with confusion I said sorry “hindi kita po maalala” then He replied and said my name tapos biglang sabi ng “laki na ng pinagbago mo ah, iba na bihisan mo ag itsura mo” then I smiled and said “uy hehe maraming salamat”. He left me with smile in his face.

Habang nagkakape inilabas ko yung libro na binabasa ko but I can’t seem to focus on what I’m reading. I look back and He is smiling at me and suddenly I was pulled back to my past. naalala ko dati sa halos araw araw na lumilipas na magisa ako sa bahay pag nagugutom ako wala akong makain at mautangan pinapalipas ko nalang yung gutom by watching TV habang hinihintay yung parents ko makauwi from work, minsan nga nadadatnan nila akong tulog sa sala kakanood tapos ginigising nalang nila ako pag kakain na. Lagi ako di nakakasama sa mga gala ng clasmates ko kasi wala naman akong pera. then I saw myself habang nakaupo sa coffee shop dito tapos napangiti ako. Narealized ko na dati maski softdrinks minsan lang ako makabili bangus na tag pipiso lang fave ko kasi yun yung kayo ko lang bilhin sa nahihingi kong pa lima limang piso pero now I get to choose my own coffee and pastry without thinking kung may laman pa ba yung wallet ko. It came to my senses nakita ko yung sinabi nyang ibang iba na ako and it made me appreciate myself on how far I had come kahit na maraming pagsubok nararamdaman ko ngayun… napakaliit na bagay yung ginawa kong pagbili ng kape pero these little things does matter. It’s a reminder na sa kabila ng mga bagay na hinihingi ko at hirap ko pang makuha ngayun na iniisp kong solution sa problema ko, I was being provided by things na madalas hindi ko naappreciate.

So it got me thinking~ if I was able to have what I can’t years ago what makes me think that I can’t have what I want now in the future? binalik nung pagupo ko sa coffee shop yung tiwala at pagmamahal ko sa life na meron ako ngayon and I’m happy and thankful for that🤟🏻✨🪐

I am heartbroken.,"My ex-boyfriend of 8 years broke up with me. He posted some of our screenshots on here and downplayed the context – everybody called me manipulative even though I worked with a therapist to communicate because I knew it was a sensitive subject. He started to say some awful things like how he could never see having children with me despite me likely being infertile due to health issues (which he knew and was previously supportive of) and how he wishes we never got together in the first place. On the Reddit post, he left out SO much information and of course, the messages without context look bizarre since they are about wanting to keep Life360 active as he suggested to rebuild trust. Plus, he lied about my mental health diagnoses – I don’t know why because he knew about both.

He’s made me believe I am an AWFUL person for my reactions to scenarios and I have spent so many weeks hating myself and trying everything I could to become better. I took what he and everybody else said, self-reflected, felt terrible and went onto medication for my Anxiety and OCD plus, gained a regular therapist – something I wanted to do for a long time, but I was struggling with money, so I put it off as a non-essential which I do regret - he told me I should've gone into my savings for therapy (I'd already lent him 8k.) During our sessions, my therapist has learnt the entire situation, background, our relationship, my actions, his actions, trauma and our conversations regarding our text messages. My therapist has advised me I was protecting my mental health and that he possibly could be narcissistic – of course, she cannot give that diagnosis but has informed me to look at these signs and see if they relate.

Upon breaking up, (I’d moved to the other side of the world for him about 9 months before because he wanted to go,) I had to choose whether to stay where I had no support system or return home. He told me we didn’t know what the future held, and I needed to get better and fix myself if there was a chance we could reconcile, and he’d miss me but I was hurting him and he needed to heal.

Background of the Relationship:

When we were teenagers, his mother kicked him out of his home, and my family and I took him in because he had nowhere else to live after we’d been together for only 8 months, I was 15 at the time. I’ve always supported him, encouraged him not to sever ties and continue to try and communicate with his family. I’d ensure they were sent cards on special occasions and gifts etc. Eventually, after a few years, he didn’t want to continue speaking to them because he didn’t want his mother or his mother’s side to know about his life. He still had contact with his Dad who lived overseas – I’d contact his younger sisters, I spent my wages on flights across the world to go and visit them, I’d coordinate their Christmas presents, arrange Facetime calls etc. After a couple of years of frequently visiting his Dad who was an alcoholic and previously caused issues when we visited his family, his Dad became verbally abusive to us both and kicked us out the home whilst we were staying with them – his step-mum also continued sending us horrible messages on a group chat after we left, I had just turned 18 at this point. After this, my ex decided he didn’t want to have contact with them. During those 4 years of no contact, I continued to try and maintain a relationship with his sisters, wishing them Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday etc. I kept asking if he wanted to rekindle with them because I know what it is like to lose family members and wish you would’ve had a closer relationship with them before it’s too late. He denied. Eventually, after 4 years, his father reached out to him again via telephone, and told him he was sober and that he was doing better now – he sort of apologised but not really more ""the past in the past so it doesn't matter anymore.""

My ex and I had intimacy issues – he became distant and stopped initiating when we were in our early 20s. For about a month or two, I just put it down to life circumstances and stress. But, he also has depression so, after that period, I started to worry. I kindly approached the situation and he told me he was stressed so I encouraged him to seek support from a therapist or a doctor. He goes on to antidepressants and is hit with all the side effects. Apathy, loss of libido, irritability etc. For about the final 3 years, he didn’t want to have sex, we didn’t kiss, we barely hugged, we didn’t really get naked around each other – it felt like a roommate situation, I’d initiate but eventually hated the rejection. I communicated all of this to him, and sought advice but he'd get annoyed that I was bringing it up and said I didn't care about him because it stressed him out. I tried to take the pressure of sex and reconnect, I suggested ways of doing this without sex, I researched, we got sex toys, I bought SO many sets of lingerie – I tried to spice things up, I did everything I felt like I could to support him and fix the relationship issues.  The longest we went without sex, anything sexual and kissing was over 8 months – and the average was around once every month or two. I’d reached out so many times on Reddit, and to professionals online for advice – he told me he had trauma from a previous relationship, stress, financial issues, physical health issues – I tried to help him work on all of it as best as I could (my OCD became much worse during this time, I worked with a therapist and had meds so I could try and support myself and him.)

After this, my boyfriend broke up with me for the first time. I tried to go no contact, he messaged me every day and I love him so I kept responding. We got back together after a month or so and he told me he was in a bad mental space, he regretted everything and he’d never let me go again and kept telling me he couldn’t live without me. A couple of months later, he told me he's moving to the country his Dad lives in (where he was born) because he wanted access to better healthcare, I was unsure if I was ready to do so I took some time to think about it – I also had an important hospital appointment that I’d waited years for regarding my health condition that causes infertility and daily suffering – he booked his flight a couple of days before this appointment despite knowing that I had this lined up. If I wanted to go, I had to cancel that appointment – which is what I had to do. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have left when we already had relationship issues but I didn’t want to lose him and I felt long distance wouldn’t work after we’d lived together for around 7 years.

 

This year:

We leave and instantly he’s in contact with his Dad, he wants his Dad to pick us up from the airport, go out for lunch etc. I politely let my ex know that I wanted to freshen up after the flight and sleep so I didn’t feel comfortable with his abusive and ex-alcoholic Dad picking us up from the airport when I hadn’t spoken to him in years. We’d previously agreed we would reconcile together and my ex consistently tells me he wanted us BOTH to be apologised to before we moved forward with a relationship with them. He then goes out with him later that day to purchase a motorbike (we’d previously agreed to go half on a car so we both could get around but he insisted he needed the motorbike, and we were in a motorbike accident a year before where I was severely injured and couldn’t walk for months so he knew I wasn’t comfortable riding one) Then, my ex’s birthday – I plan the entire day for him, take him shopping, buy him clothes, give him gifts, buy a birthday cake, balloons, and make reservations at his favourite restaurant. Halfway through the day, he tells me he is going to see his Dad. I became really upset because I knew we’d then be late to our reservations and I also had the entire day planned which he cut short. I was upset and got emotional because I felt that my efforts weren’t appreciated and he walked out and left to go see his Dad.

After that, I didn’t hear much more about his family. He tells me he is working late so I prepare dinner as late as I can for when he comes home, most nights 9, 10 or 11pm. Then, he advised he couldn’t afford the place we were staying anymore and that we needed to move into his Dad’s house. I was apprehensive due to the previous experience but, I went along with it, I tried to be friendly with his Dad and see if he truly had changed. (He had not, he had stopped alcohol as far as we knew but was on drugs, he also tried to commit suicide in front of his young daughters multiple times and was charged with a DUI and still lived with his ex-wife – all of which was either completely hidden from my ex or the truth was withheld and I found out from his teenage sisters.) I helped around the house and did most chores, spent time with his sister's and family even if he wasn't home, we were sleeping on an air mattress in the middle of a kitchen.

One night, I was speaking with his sisters, without him there, they mentioned a memory and insisted I was there too – recently. I wasn’t. They then told me that my ex had been around the house whilst he was telling me he was working late and was lying to me and I was home preparing dinner for us. Before we moved into his Dad's house, he told me he hadn't seen anyone but his Dad and that it was going to be weird for us all to see each other again. His sisters tell me all the awful things his Dad has done and said to these young girls whilst we weren’t in contact – they are scared for their lives, literally. I comfort them, try to protect them as if they were my own siblings and tell them they can always come to us for help. This continued even after we left and to this day, they know they can contact me. They don't know that we aren't together as per my ex's wishes.

I felt so betrayed by him. This hurt a lot. I had no one but him in the country, I’d just left my family and my country for him, and he was sneaking behind my back weeks after we move whilst I tried to keep things running, continue to work myself and worry about accommodation (we were looking at properties) This reared some trust issues in me – I felt betrayed and had no one to turn to. The whole time, my ex was severely apathetic and selfish which he admitted to after coming off the antidepressants. I felt really hated in the last years of the relationship – we communicated about this and he assured me he didn’t hate me but his actions didn’t match.

We still lived in their house, I tried to forget it. I came to his medical appointments to support him and tried to just continue as normal in very abnormal circumstances. Then, he had a medical procedure which was pretty invasive and his Dad once again verbally abused us, threw chairs, turned the TV volumes up full blast at 4 am and just swore, standing over our bed making a ton of noise and putting his middle finger up repeatedly and is acting awfully – it was traumatic and terrifying. My ex told me to pack up our things and to leave as soon as I was done since he had to go to work (I worked from home so it was easier for me to deal with the mess,) I packed up our things, his sisters and I have a conversation, I tell them I am always there for them and we exchange “love yous,) agree that we will see eachother soon, whilst I left and packed up our things. Again, his Dad and step-mum message my ex horrid things but he ignores them and wants to lie about our location to his family members so that they cannot communicate and figure out where we were. Despite all this, I still try to arrange for us to meet with his sisters but he never wants to because it’s difficult. They message me and tell me they miss us and want to see us. I try to arrange karaoke nights since his sister loves singing, and bowling because we all enjoyed bowling a few years back and tennis because we purchased the equipment but never had chance to use it. Every time, he said he didn’t want to because all the information would get back to his Dad and his sisters would ask too many questions. We were moving around from place to place every 1-2 weeks because we couldn’t find stable accommodation among a rental crisis – we did this for about 9+ months and never settled, we were still moving around whilst he broke up with me.

We recognise we still have relationship issues between us that we need to fix after the traumatic situation with his Dad, especially now we’re away from his Dad but still unsettled. I suggested couples therapy – we agreed to it. Even a couple of days before he ended the relationship – he agreed to counselling together and said we’d work through everything. I have messages from him praying that we work out, that he hopes his insecurities never ruin the relationship, that he is grateful I was there and supported him through a ton of stuff in life, how incredible I am and how much he wants to spend his life with me etc.

There were a lot of broken promises on his part, a lack of sex drive and affection and avoidance conflict – he told me my naked body didn’t do anything for him etc (really damaged my self-esteem and triggered aspects of my mental health conditions and I became very anxiously attached) He says that he wants to rebuild my trust and apologises for hiding things from me, I ask how he felt he could do that. We previously had location sharing via Life360 for safety purposes but he tells me that he could also keep that in place to build trust too. Then it stopped working, I kindly notified him that it stopped working, and he started acting weird and then eventually when I realised it still wasn’t working after a few days of him saying he’d fix it, that’s when the screenshots came in – I worked with a therapist to try and communicate my feelings and hear him out since I knew it was sensitive but I was still called manipulative and controlling on Reddit so I’m not going to do that again.

I TRIED to encourage us to both make friends because we both had no support system – he told me he wanted to make friends, I gave him app suggestions like Bumble BFF, I said there were FB groups, I reached out to some groups I am in to see if anyone had boyfriends in the same situation or anybody wanted to meet as a couple – I watched him sit and swipe every person away and when I planned to go to couples meet or events, we ended up breaking up so we never did them. I encouraged him to stay in contact with his sisters, I also encouraged him to stay in contact with his Auntie and cousins who lived overseas who we had visited – I contacted them nearly every week to check in and make sure they were okay and regularly contacted them – they reached out after he told them that “he broke things off for us to heal,” and told me how much they love me etc. I never once tried to isolate him, I put my all into this relationship – so much so that I lost myself, I was just worried about whatever would make him happy, what I thought he wanted, which upon reflection I understand isn’t healthy either but I put everything into us.

I took accountability for everything wrong in the relationship, he believes I was in the wrong. But, afterthought, I believe we went through SO much and so many unordinary situations with mental and physical health issues plus family issues, plus no support system AND moving across the world and then interstate every 1-2 weeks, worrying about our next accommodation and trying to hold down jobs. We BOTH hurt each other by amplifying each other’s mental health or flaws. It was so draining. However, 3 weeks before he ended the relationship, he was telling me how in love he was with me, he got a huge tattoo which he incorporated my favourite flowers into, I went to every appointment with him and held his hand through the long sessions, packed him lunch etc. We booked a trip for Christmas together. A couple of days before he broke up with me, we seemed so happy. I have pictures of us looking at each other, crazily in love and laughing. The day before he broke up with me, were arranging a property inspection. Once he ended it, anytime I spoke to him and apologise or talk about things he said I was trying to manipulate him, he didn’t believe I loved him or cared for him.

During the time we weren’t together and were still living together, he slept in the same bed with me despite being able to sleep in a separate room if he wished, still invited me on errands with him, told me where he was going to be living and invited me to find an apartment nearby and ordered food for us but the stuff he said online was so horrible and accusatory. I still grabbed us coffees and food, checked in on him frequently and tried to apologise and talk. He gave me hope for the future. When I left and he dropped me at the airport, I told him I loved him and he did say “I love you too.” And, he gave me a hug.

He contacted me the entire flight home and checked in on me. I tried to go no contact. After three days, he checked in on me again. Afterwards, he kept trying to speak about my family dog – who we both adore and we were there when he came home as a puppy together – but I had to ignore the messages and go no contact again, it’s just too emotional and fresh and I am shocked he still wants to talk to me considering everything he believes about me.

I know we weren’t perfect, life handed us so much shit and we did our best to love each other through that, we were kids when we fell in love and even then, we didn’t have a “normal” relationship because we lived with each other at 15 and 16, we never knew how to be in a relationship – we just tried as best we could. I tried to support him, I lent him so much money, I saw him cry, I tried to work through the intimacy issues, I picked up the pieces from his parent and family issues, I sat there through the depression, the trauma he opened up to me about – I tried and I think I just neglected myself and my mental health in the process, trying to pour from an empty cup.

My OCD and Anxiety did get bad, but I didn’t care because I didn’t think it affected anyone other than me, and I felt like I deserved to feel that way so it was okay – which I learnt at the end it was affecting him too but it wasn’t intentional. But there were so many perfect elements for so many years, so many good times, so much love and care. And, I still do love and care for him. He really was my bestfriend and always will be.

 

TLDR;

My ex-boyfriend of 8 years broke up with me after misrepresenting our relationship online, leading to public accusations against me. I supported him through family issues including dealing with his abusive and alcoholic father and mental health struggles, moving across the world as he wished. Despite my efforts to address our relationship problems, he ended things suddenly after posting online and expressing love just days before and making permanent gestures to our relationship. Now, he’s reaching out post-breakup, and still gave hope for the future which complicates my feelings. I still care for him, but I neglected my mental health while trying to support him.",1,1730730860.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 3

**Memory transcription subject: Arch Cyvlezh**

*Date\[Datkashi Standard\]: 72nd of 3rd Winter*

Exterminators sectioned off the whole factory floor. Nobody was allowed in or out of the building without express permission. For three hours we waited for them to go over security footage and interrogate witnesses. Finally, they began asking each and every worker if they could identify the Datkashi in the video. They turned on a massive holoset and played back the entire incident, capturing every gruesome moment.

A lithe, feminine physique, unlike any of the women around the floor I’d seen, with black fur crept up behind the Kolshian, who was too busy watching the line to notice her. In a flash, she threw her full body into him, sending him stumbling into the assembler. Claws and prods immediately gripped and tore at his tentacles, and pulled him deeper into the mechanism to churn him up. By the time the alarm blared, the assassin was gone.

Once it was clear nobody could identify her, we were cleared to leave early so they could clean up the floor. On my way to the door, Millie caught up to me.

“I can’t believe it,” he moaned. “That’s *another* death on the factory floor! Haizh forbid we’re haunted! Or cursed!” he bellowed.

“We ain’t cursed, ya dolt,” I chastised. “The gal back there sure didn’t look supernatural to me.”

“I guess… but why would anyone do such a thing?”

“I can think of a few reasons,” I grumbled under my breath.

“What?”

“Nothin’. I dunno why anyone’d do that. Ain’t right to just go killin’ folk.”

“Agreed,” Millie nodded. “So, you got any plans now that we’re off the rest of the day?”

“Well, I *was* gonna head o’er to Block Eight. See what all the buzz is ‘bout them gatherings,” I answered as we stepped outside. The clouds overhead were beginning to part. The blue sky beyond seemed sickly, and the rays of sun on my skin forlorn. I was still torn on that Kolshian’s death. Surely he didn’t deserve it personally, but what his species did to us Southerners makes me almost gleeful at the thought.

“Ooh sounds fun. Can I tag along? Been real lonely since Deirl’s been gone ‘n all,” he sighed and adjusted his spectacles.

“Sure thing,” I smiled, patting his shoulder.

“Oh! Thank ya, Arch!” Millie grinned.

We walked toward Block Four, our home sector, in relative silence. The streets were almost totally deserted during work hours, giving the appearance of a ghost town. All that concrete and metal, the spires overlooking us from the city’s skyline, everything around was built in only the last three years. I wondered what this town must have looked like before the uplift. Those picturesque rolling violet hills, cloudless blue skies, endless fields of food and grain, it felt fictional now.

It wouldn’t be hard to convince me the Northern Province embellished itself to sound better, but surely there was *some* kernel of truth to it? Perhaps outside the town’s limits are where the natural beauty awaits. Unfortunately, the whole place is walled-in, and patrols of Exterminators prevent anyone from leaving. Unless the Northerners really *were* completely full of it, the Kolshians were doing serious damage to things around here. Ever since their arrival, even in the Southern Province, winters were getting colder, storms were getting stronger, and animal’s migration habits seemed thrown off. But surely what we’ve been given makes up for it.

My kind had never had access to the amenities in my home alone. Running water, as much as I can drink, stable food that doesn’t wane with the seasons, mystical indoor heating without so much as an ember in sight! Of course, above all else, protection from the War.

Prowling the stars were carnivorous beasts hellbent on devouring anything they came across. The Kolshians assert they’ve uplifted us to stave off our extinction at their claws. They sometimes come around and encourage folks to enlist, with promises of grandeur and heroism. That’s what Dad sought, some two years back now, when a caravan of Kolshians passed through Oseika early on in the uplift. He told me he’d fight for the village. That so long as it stands, he’s still fighting. I reckon if he’d been there the day we were relocated, he would’ve been ashes like Gnall.

I cast Dad from my thoughts before they strayed to Mama. Millie and I were finally nearing Block Four. “I’m off this way. Meetcha at yours in forty-five,” he smiled.

“Sure thing,” I nodded as we parted, then slipped my forearm onto the lock in my doorframe. Just like the factory, it shot open.

I threw off the coveralls, the stench of work still somehow accumulating on the shortened day, and decided I had enough time for a five-minute shower to freshen up. I hopped into the bathroom and twisted the dial, forgetting I forfeited warm showers for the cane, I was assaulted by a torrent of frigid water. It was good I lived alone, so nobody heard the surprised yelp that escaped my lips. I hastily lathered my fine fur and got out quickly. I was still damp when I exited the bathroom, but I’d air-dry on the way.

I dug in my closet for something casual. Most of my clothes were loaners with weird stains and holes. I finally found a half-decent overcoat and pants to throw on. There were a couple of patches on the pants, but that was better than holes. I exited the bedroom and sat down on the hard sofa in front of the holoset. I still had thirty or so minutes until Millie would be there.

I started into the black screen, wondering if there was a Kolshian somewhere within staring back. I raised my forearm to the holoset and mimed pressing buttons along it, as I’d seen done by Kolshians prior. Astonishingly, it turned on. A piercing blue light pinged a few times before it constructed the visage of a twenty-something Northerner.

“My name’s Cerelin Bre and you’re watching the three PM news,” the Northerner spoke with a silky, charismatic voice. “Last night’s PD patient tally is six thanks to our brave Exterminator guilds efficiently protecting our streets.” A series of mugshots slowly materialized. I didn’t recognize any until the last one.

“Deirl?!” I exclaimed.

The news anchor droned further about the Exterminators’ heroism while I was left reeling. Exterminators hauled him away? For what? Deirl was one of the few folks I talked to often. Probably the nicest fella I’d ever met. What could he have possibly done to get hauled off? I scrambled mentally to think of a logical explanation, but only drew blanks. Then I remembered I probably received the newspaper today, and usually they print reasons for arrests. I fiddled with my forearm and the holoset until it finally turned off and I walked into the kitchen.

In the wall next to the coffee dispenser on the counter was a small, square door. I pulled it open and a mess of mail fell onto the countertop. I couldn’t remember the last time I had bothered to check it, so suddenly finding today’s print was going to be a lot harder.

I began by sorting out anything that *wasn’t* a newspaper. Bills for a phone I didn’t have, advertisements for local businesses, a couple of saucy pages advertising some brothel downtown, before finally being left with a dozen or so prints. I threw open one, skimmed the top, and chucked it. It was a week old. The next one was a few days, the one after *two* weeks. Finally, I flipped open the *3rd Winter, 72nd print* and scanned until I found the section on arrests.

*Ghreil Drugra - Assault, Battery*

*Sia Lorink - Distribution of narcotics*

*Krau Frier - Assault*

*Baten Yeps - Sexual harrasment*

*Deirl Qwetsi - Grand treason*

I blinked, astonished. Grand treason? What in Haizh’ name does that even entail? As far as I knew, only the worst of the worst receive that penalty. Deirl wasn’t some grand criminal, terrorist, anarchist, or whatever kind of person would commit grand treason; Deirl was a good friend, a kind man of about fifty, with a jaunty walk and joky demeanor. Quick with a quip, and always offered to buy his pals drinks. I looked up to him.

A knock at the door pulled me back to reality. I hastily shoved the papers aside and answered the door.

“Hey, Arch,” Millie greeted. “You’re lookin’ a bit freaked out, everything good?” he asked.

I thought for a moment of hiding Deirl’s fate, but Millie was his friend too. Arguably, they were closer together than I was to him. They came from the same village, it was only right to do him justice. “Not really, no,” I sighed. “Gimme a sec,” I muttered, retrieving the newspaper from the pile. “Ya remember we were talkin’ about Deirl?” I asked.

“Yeah…?” Millie nodded. “Oh, he’s not in the obituaries, is he?”

“Worse.”

“What? How could anything be-” he cut off. Adjusting his spectacles, Millie leaned his fuzzy head closer, scrutinizing every drop of ink on the page. His ears fell heavily. “No, oh no no,” he mumbled. “How could he?”

“I don’t know,” I replied. “I dunno what he even did. I mean, we knew him, didn’t we?” I said.

“I suppose not,” Millie hung his head somberly. “Prob’ly took him right to Haizh.”

We took a moment of silence for him. “You still want to go to that gathering?” I asked finally, once I felt our respects were fairly paid.

“Yeah. I reckon it’d be good to take my mind off ‘im. Better be booze there though!” he chuckled awkwardly before puttering out.

“I’m sure there will be. C’mon,” I patted his shoulder and we took off down the concrete road toward Block Eight.

“So,” Millie began after a big of walking silence, “you never did tell me what your village was like. I mean, you’re Southerner, right?”

“‘Course I’m Southerner. Everybody in the blocks is. And my village was fine. Quaint little place, but all ashes now.”

“Same as mine,” He sighed. “D’ya think the Northerners care much about it?”

“About our homes? Nah. Reckon they had a good laugh over it,” I scowled. Northerners always held a strong sense of superiority over us Southerners. Some time centuries ago we all lived in the Northern Province. When the current Northerners were expanding south, down to the equator, they bumped into us and promptly kicked us from our homelands. Millions were uprooted, and those who didn’t leave were killed or enslaved. Even long after the Provinces welcomed immigrants from one another freely, the hatred broiled and tensions flared. I wouldn’t doubt if the Northerners themselves asked the Kolshians to incinerate our homes for kicks.

“Damn Chattelscalpers,” Millie breathed.

“At least we don’t gotta see their faces ‘round here,” I offered. “Anyway…” I trailed off.

We walked in silence a bit longer before he once again piped up, “How do ya think that lady got into the factory?”

“Dunno. She seemed small, maybe through a window?”

“Only a Publing could fit,” he replied. “Could have been on of the back doors, but shouldn’t there be patrols there?”

“Dunno. I don’t think I saw anyone on rotation this mornin’ though. Bad time for a day off, eh?” I nudged Millie.

“Right,” he put his hands in his coat pockets. We crossed a couple of streets and finally made it to Block Eight. The biggest building in the sector was the community center, where folks from all over town came to mingle. It was a good spot to meet new faces and enjoy a day off. Millie and I got to the doors, which slid open automatically for us. Inside was a wide-open court. Some restaurants and shops were built into the walls, and there were various activities scattered about. It was bustling at just about all hours.

“Let’s hit up Nat’s, I know the barkeep,” Millie suggested.

“Sure thing,” I nodded, following him. We cut through a couple clusters of folks playing darts, tabletop board games, and betting on cards, before emerging at the doorway to a pub called Nat’s. Nat’s was way more my speed, and plenty lively enough to meet some new folks.

We sat up front right at the bar. The barkeep greeted us chirpily, and I ordered a whiskey. Millie downed a beer and the two of us reminisced a bit about the night we met. It was late, something like two in the morning, and I was down way too many. Millie and Deirl wandered in and began singing karaoke, really poorly, and needed a third person for the set. I drunkenly volunteered and stumbled to the stage. Mic in one hand, whiskey in the other, I belted the lyrics so awful, that the bar banned me from using the machine ever again. Oh, and maybe because I might’ve broken it when I fell tail-first into the screen.

Between our conversations, I noticed a girl take a seat on the stool beside me. Since I was facing Millie, I couldn’t get all that good of a look at her, but something felt off.

“Arch,” Millie whispered. “Look over there, but don’t be obvious,” he spoke, pointing with his tail across the bar at some flamboyant hunk of a man, sitting alone legs-crossed in a booth nursing an ale. “Ya don’t think he’s…” Millie tapped the tips of his pointer fingers together.

I chuckled and slapped his shoulder. “Dude’s a total prance. Go talk to ‘im!” I winked.

His ears fell and his eyes widened. “Oh no- I couldn’t just-”

“‘Course you can, bud. Walk over and introduce ya self,” I encouraged.

In one go Millie finished his drink and slammed the cup down. “Alright,” he steeled himself.

“Good luck!” I called as he walked toward the man’s booth. Finally, I was alone. I faced forward, ordered another whiskey, and kept the lady next to me in the corner of my eye. She had white fur, completely uniform, but something was off about it. It almost looked like it was recently dyed. Remnants of black were sprinkled throughout. Her physique also matched with the assassin’s. I felt my heart race and my spine chill. I was sitting next to a psychopathic monster. A killer. *Predator diseased*. Yet she had a more intelligent look to her. There was soul in her pale eyes and geniality in her smile. 

The words *Remember Oseika* flashed back in my mind. Suddenly, I realized, she had caught my gaze. I averted my eyes fearfully, downing my whiskey.

“Hey, what’re you lookin’ at?” she asked.

“Nothin’, sorry,” I muttered. Since we were properly speaking now, I was able to get an even better look at her. She looked about my age, with pierced ears and an amused look in her eye.

“If ya want a gal’s attention, you should just ask, mister,” she giggled. “What brings ya here?”

“Uhm,” I pointed my tail toward Millie, who seemed to be having a very lively conversation with the prance from earlier. “My friend there. Needed a wingman.”

“That’s cute,” she remarked.

“How about you?” I asked.

“I’m here for the atmosphere. Joints like these got a lot goin’ on. Real easy to fall into the crowd.” Yeah, I bet that’s exactly what she wanted to do. Blend in.

“You hear the news?” I dared. “About that factory down by First Block?”

“Oh yes. Tragic what happened,” she sounded so believable it almost convinced me she was innocent. “That poor Kolshian. I hope his family ain’t hurtin’ too bad.”

“Yeah. Me too.” We sat in an awkward silence before those words crept back into my mind. They were alluring, dancing on my tongue, begging to be spoken out. I sucked in a deep breath and spoke flatly, “Remember Oseika.”

A smirk crossed her features and she extended a hand. “Maz,” she spoke.

I took her hand, “Arch.”

“Where did you hear that phrase, Arch?” she asked, not letting go of my hand. Alarmingly, I noticed an incredibly small syringe being held to my palm. Inside was some sort of green liquid I couldn’t identify, but it didn’t look good.

“I-I uh-” I stuttered. I felt the needle break my skin. “It was- it was written on a wall,” I explained. “Outside a honky-tonk down the way in town. I- please don’t,” I cried.

Maz popped the syringe out of my palm, clicked a button on the side to retract the needle, and slipped it into her coat. “I know the place. Congratulations, you found the revolution.”

Started with Mojo because that's what everyone uses. It was okay - I'd sit there every morning, coffee in hand, grinding out calls. Hit 100 dials most days and felt pretty good about it.

Then I heard about PhoneBurner. The way people talked about it, you'd think it was magic. And yeah, the voicemail drop feature was sweet - saved me from saying ""Hey, just following up..."" a hundred times a day.

But here's the thing - 6 months later, I'm stuck. Same numbers. Same results. Just a fancier system.

I know there's got to be something better out there. Something that actually helps me talk to more people, not just dial more numbers.

So here I am, asking: What dialer can help me with better connect rates, keeping the price tag in mind?!  
And most importantly - was it worth it?",1,1730730188.0,SaaSSales,0,1.0,False

1gjfcgh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjfcgh,Update on changes and advice,"Hey everyone! I wanted to post an update on some changes after very helpful input from some of you guys. 

I've moved the mirror to balance the room. I swopped the entryway stand for hooks (that I sprayed black) and a bench - I spaced them for functionality with that doorway. I also replaced the kiddie table and chairs with our extra oak coffee table - it looks better and the kiddo prefers it  anyway. I'll think I'll be adding two small textured terracotta pouffes for kiddos. We'll be painting soon.

Now for balance I want to put an artwork that I enherited from my mom on the open wall, and I have one that I think goes well with the rest of the room's colouring. I wanted to get input on whether you guys think a nude is alright for an open plan kitchen/living area? My mom had it up in her TV room my whole childhood and I think it's beautiful. I also want to add some tall art between the doorway and hooks/bench for symmetry.. or would that look too cluttered?

I (F35) recently changed my job. I am with the new company for 2 months. One of my colleagues(M35) from another team is making small comments each time we go to lunch, that make me think he might be interested in me; comments about my shoes, my habits, my food etc. Recently, he made a comment about my earrings, he asked if they were new? I was nicely surprised that he even noticed. After we had lunch with the team, the both of us split from the team to grab a coffee. He asked me what coffee and cookie he should get? He actually took my suggestions, which also surprised me in a good way. During our walk he was interested in my personal life, and after we discussed a personal topic about me, I’ve asked him to also share some personal thing and he did. Overall, I felt that he is a sweet person and he is interested in getting to know me. 
Now, what do you think: is he genuinly interested in getting to know me as a person/colleague or is he interested in more? I don’t want to assume but I also don’t see these stuff from a man.

Open to picking up new hobbies / interests! I like hiking, anything outdoors really, play a bit of golf. Love nothing better than a good conversation over a cup of tea (coffee is acceptance…). Play a bit of music sometimes just casually. Like to read and chat about technology / philosophy.
