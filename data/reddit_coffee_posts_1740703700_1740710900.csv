I checked my desk, looked under sheets of paper, and even peeked into my coffee mug, but no luck. Thinking I must have dropped it, I stood up and spun around. Still nothing. Sighed, gave up, and sat down. Turns out, it was already in my hand the entire time.

1izxlsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1izxlsb/ordered_a_kingrinder_p2_now_what/,Ordered a KINGrinder P2 - Now What?,"I finally pulled the trigger on a hand grinder because as I grow in my coffee journey (just recently switched to drinking coffee black. Day 6 actually) I can't ignore the issues I have with a blade grinder.

SO...

Now that I will have this P2, what can I expect. I've watched dozens of YT videos and while they all tell me how wonderful the KINGrinder series of grinders is I want to know more about the perceived learning curve with using a hand grinder. Folks often talk about ""calibrating"" the grinder to zero but my research shows that's not even a thing. 

Should I have saved for a better, more user friendly manual grinder? Should I have bought an electric grinder instead? Help a fellow out with your wisdom!

  
Oh! As a bit of reference, I don't brew espresso, have a Chemex, but don't use it and I don't own a drip brewer. Exclusively brew with either my AP or a Bodum 4-cup French Press. I do enjoy light/medium roasts more than darker roasts. I don't think I have a ""refined palate"" for coffee but I can taste some flavors in coffee now. I have subs to Red Bay Coffee and Atlas Coffee Club. OK, ask if you need more details and thanks in advance. ",1,1740710674.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False
1izxlha,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1izxlha/when_i_was_sixteen_homeless_kids_were_going/,"When I was sixteen, homeless kids were going missing in my town. I was one of them.","I won't go into detail why I was thrown out of my house at sixteen. Financial problems/I came from a poor family. 

Mom and Dad wanted me to get a job, and I wanted to stay in school, so that caused arguments. 

I also made the mistake of revealing to them an intimate part of myself I should've kept fucking hidden. 

Look, I won't say being on the street was “better”. 

But being away from that toxic environment was like a breath of fresh air. 

I lived in a pretty big town, and there were a lot of kids living on the streets. 

I did try and find somewhere at first. 

I stayed in hotels with my last remaining cash, but then I found myself with the option of eating or starving. I was VERY stubborn at sixteen. I hated asking for handouts, and just the idea of asking my school for help was like “losing”. 

I didn't want my friends and teachers to know about my situation, so I dropped school. Again, I was a stupid stubborn kid. 

I obviously should have asked for help, but back then, teachers didn't care. 

Kids in my school were severely bullied, and nothing ever changed. 

They were there to teach, and that was it. 

So, the thought of telling them I was fucking homeless just wasn't happening. 

I didn't want their pity. 

I didn't want their attempt to try empathize with me when in reality, they did not give a fuck. 

So, yes, I ended up on the streets. 

But there was a community of us. 

We were all in the same situation. Thrown out for the same reasons. Toxic and abusive parents, or significant others. 

So, all we had were each other. 

I've seen homeless kids depicted on TV/movies as scrappy pickpockets. 

That's a lie. The kids who I hung with weren't brave enough to pick-pocket. 

If they saw cash/food/anything they wanted hanging around unclaimed, they would snatch it up. 

The pickpocket thing is just the media glamorizing the idea of being a street kid, turning them into a “fun, quirky group of teenage criminals trying to survive.”

The reality is a lot more depressing. 

I ended up in a group of kids on the south side of our town. 

Ben, the leader of our gang, was the latest to disappear. 

Look, I didn't believe in the “child catcher” rumors. I thought they were just stories—but it became evident someone was actually kidnapping street kids. 

I may have come from a toxic house, but I was sheltered. I didn't think things like that existed. I had never been in the type of situation when they COULD exist. 

Kidnapping was like a foreign concept to me. 

It only happened in movies and cartoons. 

But then familiar faces I knew started to disappear– Carly, a street performer who was trying to earn enough money to leave town. Jason, the weird kid with the eyepatch who tried to steal my phone. 

These kids weren't friends, but they felt comfortable. 

They felt like a community, even when I wasn't personally close with them. 

Carly always smiled at me, offering me fresh donuts some old man handed her in the morning. 

Jason was always skulking around the music stores, asking for change. 

Every time I saw him, we talked about things that didn't even matter. 

But talking to him made me feel less alone. When Jason disappeared, that normalcy I’d gotten used to started to fade. I looked for him, but his familiar purple woolen hat had vanished. 

Carly was always singing under the bridge every afternoon. 

I could hear her voice while snoozing in the park entrance. She sounded like an angel. 

With her gone, I felt colder than usual. 

I couldn't get warm no matter how many times I rubbed my hands together and stuck my hands under my coat. I had holes in my socks and shoes, and the freezing chill was creeping into my bones. 

Carly’s disappearance really shook me up. 

Especially when, several days later, a guy took her spot with his guitar, belting out painfully bad reimaginings of pop songs. 

When Ben vanished, I started taking word-of-mouth more seriously. 

*""He's been taken by the white van,""*  was the rumor floating around. 

Apparently, some kid saw Ben getting dragged into a white van. 

This kid was also known to say BS to get attention, but his claim was actually believable. 

Ben, Carly, Jason, and the other missing kids were last seen at the homeless shelter. 

So, the place where kids were vanishing—wasn't exactly ideal.

But it *did* have hot soup and coffee, as well as a place to charge my phone, so I risked it.

The homeless shelter was where most kids hung out every day. 

It was also the prime spot for drug deals (behind the soup kitchen). 

I used the mostly broken facilities to shower, use the bathroom, and try to make connections with kids who were well known. It was pretty much a survival instinct at this point. 

If I was going to survive on the streets, I needed people I could count on. 

I had this constant need to get my name out there. Just in case I was one of the missing. 

But it turns out, not all homeless kids play nice. 

I won't go into detail, but there were a lot of names I thought I could trust, and quickly learned that I couldn't fucking trust anyone. 

I got my (first) phone stolen, and then my shoes were snatched while I was sleeping. 

I was definitely hardened after a while on the streets. 

So, when Charlie came along, I basically told him to go fuck himself. 

All of the ‘connections’ I made just lost me cash, food, and my shit. The worst thing you can be as a street kid is nice. 

If you want to be left alone, you have to make it very fucking clear. Without Ben’s leadership, things went off the handle. 

I was quickly labeled as a naive bastard who f/w anyone. Most of my spots were compromised, so I had no choice but to once again risk the homeless shelter. 

My initial plan was to grab food and coffee, and make a run for it. 

I had the town library as a safe spot until 4pm, and after 10, the guy who owned the Chinese takeout begrudgingly let me sleep in his doorway. 

I think he felt sorry for me. But at this point I was too fucking cold to care about pride. 

The volunteers in the soup kitchen were my age. I didn't know them (thankfully), but I was eager to get out of there. 

The food was a choice of cold curry or soup. I chose soup, and a chunk of stale bread. 

The coffee was always lukewarm, but it was coffee. I wasn't going to complain. 

I was trying to eat it as fast as I could without burning my mouth, when a kid I can only describe as the human embodiment of a golden retriever slid next to me, grasping his own bowl of soup.  

With dark brown hair under his hood and freckled cheeks— not to mention his expensive jacket and shoes—I knew the streets would eat him alive.

This kid looked like he'd stepped right out of a perfect suburban home. 

He had a Mommy and Daddy, and a perfect fucking life. Lucky him. 

I was having  a hard time taking in his expensive clothes. 

Yes, his hair was greasy and his clothes were slightly discolored (holes in his gloves, dirt smearing his face) so he was clearly sleeping rough. 

But this guy was ASKING to get his branded coat stolen. 

""Take *that* off,"" I said through a mouthful of stale bread.

That was all I could say. I didn't want to say “hi”, because *hi” was an invitation to join me. I was on my third phone, and I wasn't taking any chances with this kid. 

Two years of fucking with the wrong people, I was done. 

I nodded at his jacket, and he looked confused. 

“Huh?”

""Put it in your backpack, idiot.” I was just warning him of my past mistakes. I DID have my dad's expensive watch, and some kicks I bought with money from a summer job before I left home. I lost both of them because I failed to hide them. 

Elizabeth and Mari, two older girls I thought I could trust, were now proud owners of my shit. 

The guy had this docile look on his face, eyes wide like a fucking deer. 

I had no idea how he had survived this long. If he was sleeping in the shelter, yes it was “safer”, and warmer, but it also made him a target for kidnapping. 

“Unless you *want* to lose it.” I added, finishing my soup. 

The guy continued eating, completely unbothered. 

“Your jacket.” I said, directly. 

I didn't lose my patience much, but this guy was testing me. 

“Take it *off*, or you will lose it.”

After being fucked around with by Ben’s asshole friends, it felt strangely good to be an asshole back to a total stranger. 

The kid hesitated, before pulling off his jacket and backpack, awkwardly yanking off the jacket, and stuffing it inside his bag.

Then he sat there shivering like an idiot, and I gave up and offered him one of my spare sweaters. 

Street kids usually wanted something in return, and I was waiting for his proposition.

Instead, he said, “Thanks!” and pulled it on.

“I'm Charlie.” he introduced himself, when I stood to leave, grabbing my own pack. 

I told him I didn't ask, and that it was nice meeting him. 

When he followed me, I thought we were just going the same direction. 

But then I took a turn down an alleyway, and his footsteps hesitated, before coming after me. I was all ready to get him to beat it, but looked lost. He had this look on his face, like he was trying and failing to look intimidating. 

This kid didn't look like he was going to steal my shit while I was sleeping. 

I didn't officially ask him to join me, it just sort of happened? 

When I got back to my spot, he dropped his pack and started unrolling his sleeping bag next to mine.

I took advantage of his kindness, that innocence that was yet to be drained from him by every stone-cold night that never seemed to end. 

Midnight and dawn felt like centuries apart, and I was never warm enough. 

My toes were always numb, my fingers losing all feeling. 

The worst part was when I didn't have enough to eat, so I started fantasizing. 

But Charlie never lost that stupid fucking smile. Even when he was freezing to death. 

I told him to grab us food for the night– and he came back with two pizza rolls, and a can of soda to share. 

I asked him *how* he'd gotten them, and he shrugged with a grin. 

This kid expected me to play along with his cryptic games every time he did something vaguely helpful. 

I didn't care how he'd gotten them. 

I was just thankful. 

I started to see Charlie as less of a nuisance, and more of a friend. 

Charlie was loud and obnoxious, and drove me insane with his ‘dreams’ of getting out of town and his situation. 

But he  made me smile—even in freezing temperatures. 

He never told me about *why* he was on the streets. 

Instead, he always changed the subject back to me. 

I didn't realize how self centered I was until I spilled my entire life story to him, and when he opened up about himself, I started talking about *myself* once again. 

In a way, I think I saw it like a competition. “Oh, your life is bad? Well, *this* happened to me.”

I waited for him to get frustrated or angry, but he just listened. 

He always listened. 

It was snowing when the two of us sat shivering on a wall, our legs dangling. 

I don't remember who's genius idea it was to sit in sub zero temperatures, but I remember enjoying the icy breeze on my face. Everything was covered in white. 

I don't think I should have enjoyed snow. 

It was extremely fucking easy to freeze to death in these conditions. 

But it was also *snow*. 

And I was still a stupid kid. I still liked snow. 

Charlie was, as usual, being his chipper self. 

He scored us a pack of chips to share, so we were passing it back and forth. 

My hands were so numb I couldn't even feel the chips. I just stuffed them in my mouth. ""Do you believe in angels, Finn?"" 

That question caught me off guard. Charlie’s gaze was glued to a little girl perfecting a snow angel in front of us. 

The answer was no.

I didn't believe in God. Any God's. Any religion. 

If God existed, or the “angels”, my parents wouldn't have kicked me out for liking guys. 

In the earlier days, I prayed for help.

I had the stupid idea that my mom would actually hunt me down and take me back home. 

But God didn't exist, at least not to me—and I was tired of pretending. 

I didn't respond to Charlie, and his head dropped onto my shoulder. 

I jerked back, swallowing a hiss. I shoved him away, and for the first time since I'd met him, his smile started to fade. 

""Sorry,"" he muttered, rubbing his hands together. Charlie seemed to notice our proximity, shuffling away from me. 

He said I was warm, and I hated myself for shouting at him. 

Because he was fucking warm too. 

I liked the feeling of his head on my shoulder. 

He felt safe and warm, and the closest thing I had to a home. 

I jumped off the wall, making an excuse to distance myself. 

I think I told him I was going to the shelter to try to find warm clothes from the lost and found. 

Charlie didn't reply, only jerking his head in a nod. 

He told me he’d be right there when I got back, and his words settled my twisting gut, the growing lump in my throat. 

I used my time away from him to come to terms with my feelings, and instead of pushing them away, like I had done for so long, suppressing and fucking swallowing them down, I realized I wanted Charlie to stay with me. Charlie was Home. 

I had barely known this kid for a few months, and yet with him, I didn't feel cold anymore. 

I went back to the wall, ready to apologize to Charlie, but to my surprise, he was gone. I figured he'd gone searching for food since it was almost around dinner time, so I waited. I waited until the sky was dark, and I was so fucking cold, my teeth were chattering. 

I noticed an old man who was playing chess with pigeons earlier. 

Charlie had pointed him out, laughing at one particular pigeon, who seemed too self aware. 

I hurried over to him. 

“Did you see me earlier?” I twisted around, pointing at the wall the two of us sat on. 

The man nodded. “Oh, you're looking for your friend?” He slid another chess piece across the board. “I believe he walked away with a man a few hours ago now.”

“What man?” I felt like I was going to puke. 

I asked him to describe the guy, but the old man shrugged. 

“I have bad eyes, kid. It was just a man. Late forties, I think.” 

His expression softened when my stomach crawled into my throat. 

“Are you all right?” he reached into his pocket and pulled out a sour candy, dropping it into my hand. “You should go home now, kid. I'm sure your parents are worried about you.”

Again, I asked him to describe this man, this time through my teeth. 

But the old guy just turned back to his one-man chess game. 

I think part of me was in denial. I went back to our sleeping spot, expecting Charlie to be there, already comfortable in his sleeping bag, talking about optimistic BS. 

But he wasn't. 

I ran back to the shelter with his name choked in my mouth. 

I was living my own personal nightmare. Being snatched into the night, and nobody even knowing my name. 

I just got weird looks, kids looking progressively more freaked out. 

I wouldn't accept it at first. 

Charlie could have been anywhere. But the longer I waited for him in all of our spots, It became clear that Charlie was just another missing street kid who was there one minute, and gone the next. 

He was another Ben. 

Another Carly. 

But this time, I made the mistake of getting to know him.

He was more than a name. 

Charlie was my friend. 

I asked strangers if they'd seen him. 

Passers by looked me up and down like I was dirt on their shoe.

These people had places to be. 

They didn't care about some faceless kid disappearing from the street. I already knew what they were thinking when they offered pitiful smiles, and said things like:

*“Sorry, I don't know.”*

They were wondering *why* Charlie was sleeping rough in the first place. 

Why he didn't just ‘get help’. 

I'm going to tell you the hardest thing I've come to realize. 

It's easy to be numb on the streets. 

Easy to shut down. Easy to forget to mourn, because it was too fucking cold. 

I didn't forget about Charlie, but I did bury him, so I wouldn't forget how to survive. 

So, a month later, I thought I was fucking hallucinating when I saw that all too familiar jacket; the one I told him MULTIPLE TIMES to keep out of sight. 

It was snowing again, and it was thick and wet, clinging to my jeans. 

I was trying to find a patch of concrete free of snow to dump my sleeping bag. 

I scored hand warmers from one kid who was nice enough to offer them for a DS I'd found. 

There he was. Somehow. 

Charlie was standing in the middle of an empty road, in dead of night. 

I didn't question why or *how*. I just hugged him, mentally promising myself I would never let him go again. 

Charlie was so warm.

His coat was thicker, and his backpack was nowhere to be seen. 

""Where did you go?!"" I demanded, shoving him back. 

Charlie just smiled, and I noticed his pocket, a Blackberry phone sticking out. 

I think I was about to laugh, wondering just how he’d managed to get a fucking BLACKBERRY, when a clammy hand suddenly clamped over my mouth. 

Warm arms wrapped around my torso and yanked me back. I screamed, but my cries were muffled—the hand clamping tighter until I couldn’t fucking breathe.

I remember being violently dragged back, my feet stumbling, my body struggling to stay upright.

I was dragged halfway down the street, hoisted onto a stranger’s shoulders, and dumped into the back of an awaiting van.

It didn't feel like it was happening to me. All those nights I had nightmares about being the next kid snatched into oblivion.

I never thought it would be me. I couldn't even cry out, my body felt paralyzed. 

I was dragged backwards through snow, and then I was on my knees on the ice-cold flooring of a van jerking left to right, staring at silver shutters being violently pulled down like I was an animal. 

I dived forward, but I was trapped.

""I'm sorry, Finn,"" Charlie’s voice pricked the silence. The back of the van was so cold, and the smell was already there—potent, a thick, rotting decay.

“But you're the perfect body and shape for my father,” he said, his voice deadpan and wrong. “I hope this doesn't change things between us,” he whispered.

His voice was different—taunting and cold—sending shivers down my spine.

“We’re still friends, right?”

I fucking screamed at him.

That bastard.

He played the role so well, I should have fucking applauded him.

I slammed my fists into the shutters, but the ignition came to life, and the van jerked forward, sending me stumbling back.

I dropped to my knees, choking on the stink of decay. I didn't want to look.

The light was too bright, too invasive, scorching the chill from my skin.

I stayed on my knees until the smell got so bad, I had to fucking look.

In front of me were bodies. Most of them were faceless, with no features, skin already crumbling from bones jutting out.

One of them caught my eye, lying at the bottom of the pile.

Ben. His skin was gray, dried blood staining his face, painting his clothes. 

I was already trying to roll him onto his front, so I didn't have to look at him. His eyes were open, like he was still alive.

I shoved him onto his stomach, and something sour crawled up my throat, my stomach revolting.

I thought I was seeing things. But no.

When I reached forward, my fingers touched them—the twisted, feathery appendages protruding from twin slits cruelly sliced into a jutting spine.

I shuffled back, a cry clawing from my throat.

Wings.

They were rotten, decaying—the wings of a bird, or something else—spliced with his flesh. I could see where his back had been cut open, all the way down his spine. Ben was dead.

His wings were dying, festering inside a body that was ice-cold and alone, where he would never be found. That thought was quick to hit me. *Just like me*.

Carly’s short brown curls were buried under another corpse, a much younger kid.

I could still see the pale blue of her coat, her yellow hat still frozen to her head.

Carly had one singular wing sticking from her back, while the rest of her rotted away.

I tripped over something—Carly’s backpack.

I could glimpse Jason's kicks sticking out from the pile.

I couldn't look.

They had names. They were real kids. Carly. Ben. Jason.

They existed. Even if this world was so obsessed with fucking erasing them.

""Finn?"" Charlie's whisper slipped through the shutters.

I held onto his voice, willing it to be him.

Charlie.

""Do you believe in angels?” he asked me once again.

He still had that voice—that innocent, chipper tone I fell for.

But there was an unmistakable twisting madness clinging to every word.

I didn't respond. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

After a while, his voice stopped trying to get my attention.

I just sat, freezing cold, my arms around my knees.

I was going to fucking die.

I kept looking at the kids who vanished, their bodies twisted and contorted into a cruel fantasy. The van stopped when I was falling asleep, jerking me awake.

I heard footsteps outside. The shutters slid open, and in front of me, to my surprise, was a middle-aged woman.

Her smile was kind, despite the gleam in her eye.

She held out her arms, gesturing for me to come toward her.

“It's okay, honey,” she told me. “You're okay now.”

Charlie was standing next to her, his arms folded.

“Careful,” he muttered, nudging her. I saw his lip curl in disgust. 

Illuminated in the van’s headlights, I saw who really was; a spoiled, psychotic kid playing with his toys. Charlie mockingly stepped back. “He might attack you.”

Behind him stood a towering man, holding a gun pointing it between my eyes.

I had no choice, letting them pull me from the van.

The man was quick to slip a shot into the back of my neck, which turned my body to lead.

I was lifted into someone's arms. I remember they were warm.

The last thing I remember is a bright light getting closer.

I don't know how long I was out for. Long enough to get an actual, proper sleep.

When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the sun peeking through gaps in a wooden door, my head turned at an awkward angle. It looked like I was in some kind of farmhouse. I could see piles of hay and horse shit in the corner. I was lying on my stomach, my wrists pinned down. 

The pain crept in slowly—at first a dull thud, before slamming into me, agonizing lightning bolts striking down my spine.

So fucking painful, my vision blurred and feathered, losing focus.

I've had sensory issues since I was a kid, and I could feel the entirety of my upper back had been split open.

I could feel my own blood dripping down my skin, and something cruel and sharp forcing flaps of flesh apart. The thought of being cut open was enough to send me into fucking hysteria. I remember screaming until my throat was raw, until I  I passed out again. This time, a mercy. 

The pain wouldn't leave, pulling me into agony, and then letting me go.

When I came around for the second time, I felt the ice-cold scalpel slicing into my back.

But I didn't feel like I was cut open anymore. I felt a painful tugging when I tried to move. Stitches holding me together.

“That's all finished,” the man’s voice sounded. “The body is almost ready.”

“But when?”

That voice sent shivers creeping down my spine.

Charlie.

“You said that last time, and the last three died, Dad.” I could sense his rolled eyes. “Admit that you're just killing them, and you actually have no idea what you're doing.”

“I said he's ready,” the man grumbled.

“So, let him fly!” Charlie groaned. “Come on, Dad, I want to see the angel fly!”

I was aware I was gasping into the cold surface of the surgical table.

“His stitches are still fresh,” the man said. “When he's ready, you can play with him.”

I was left alone after that.

Hours.

Then, a full day.

But I wasn't hungry anymore. I was thirsty. I didn't sleep.

I was trying to find the best position to lie in (on my side) when footsteps startled me.

“Hey, Finn.”

Charlie's voice was an excited whisper. I felt his warm fingers tiptoe down my back before reaching for my restraints.

He pulled them apart, helping me up, and I immediately dragged my hand down my back, where I was sure I’d touch my ugly, protruding spine. But instead, I felt smooth skin.

Slowly, I lowered myself off the table. Charlie was holding my backpack.

“Here!” he said excitedly, shoving it into my chest.

“Dad says I'm not allowed to let you go yet, but I'm too impatient.” His eyes never left my back.

Without responding, I took my backpack, shoved past him, and broke into a sprint.

I pushed through the doors of the farmhouse and kept running.

I expected to be grabbed and pulled back. But I wasn't. 

Charlie just stood there watching me, grinning, an inhuman grin stretched across his face. 

I didn't stop until I couldn't breathe, until I was on my knees, on some unfamiliar road in the middle of nowhere. I was picked up by a woman who offered to take me to the sheriff's station. She gave me hot tea and food, but I declined both. 

I wasn't hungry, and my body didn't feel like my own. 

When we got into town, and I was sure I knew where I was, I dived out of her car. 

I went to the restroom, pulled off my shirt, and ran my fingers down my back. I could feel them. 

Something was moving under my skin, twitching, like they were alive. 

When I gingerly touched my skin, I could feel tiny stitches all the way down my spine. 

Part of me wondered what would happen if I ripped them open. 

After a single restless night on the street, I realized I couldn't fucking do it anymore. 

I ended up asking for help when the pain in my back kept me up at night.

I could feel them physically trying to push through my skin, straining against my spine. I couldn't sleep on my back, or my side. The best sleeping position was lying on my stomach. 

Winter moved into spring, and I felt like I was dying. I couldn't eat, and I was weak. 

I think it was luck. Maybe a miracle. 

I walked into one of my old teachers. Mrs W. She didn't ask about my situation, but she did offer a place to stay. 

That was the best thing about Mrs W. 

No matter how much I knew she wanted to ask, she never invaded my privacy. She saw the scars on my back, saw me puke up everything I ate. But she didn't speak.

Mrs W asked me if I wanted to share anything with her, and I said, “No.”

If anyone knew what was inside my back, I’d be sliced open again. 

I was nineteen at this point– and I was tired and in too much pain to care about accepting handouts. 

Mrs W let me sleep in her spare room. She offered me food, but I could never eat it. 

I could only drink water, and even that was hard to stomach. 

She took me to the emergency room to get my back checked out, but after I suffered a panic attack at the thought of opening up to a doctor, she promised *no hospitals*. 

The pain got worse. It fucking laughed at medication. 

It got so bad, one night, I stood on the roof of Mrs W’s house, and let the pain take over, ripping through me, until something was splitting my spine, sending me to my knees.

I could feel them coming through, breaking through my skin.

They felt wrong and awkward, like additional limbs. I panicked, and with shaking hands, forced the twitching *things* back into twin slits. 

That did relieve the pain.

I still couldn't eat or drink, but I started to feel human again. 

Mrs W offered to send me back to school, and I did. I went back to finish high school. 

The eating/drinking thing got easier. I think my body just got used to it. 

After school, I got into community college, and Mrs W helped me buy my first place. 

I grew up, with the gnawing feeling that something wasn't *right* with me.

The pain was still agonizing, and at times, I would have to rip open the stitches, and let them free. I've never once tried to figure them out, because I'm fucking terrified of them. 

I'm 29 now. I live far away from my hometown. I have a boyfriend, and an apartment, and I finally feel human again. 

Last night, I was waiting for a train home. It was freezing, and already, I could feel my back twitching, pain starting to gnaw at me. 

It's worse these days. Not just the pain. I'm sleepwalking. 

I'll find myself blocks away from my house, with no recollection of how I got there. 

I don't know why I'm no different from my teenage self. 

I still don't want to ask help, because whatever is inside me isn't fucking human. 

So, I kept my mouth shut. 

There was a homeless girl slumped in the corner of the platform. 

I've made it my goal. Whenever I see a homeless kid, I point them to the nearest shelter– and when they roll their eyes at me, I offer to take them there myself. 

I don't leave them until I know these kids are safe. Yes, they can be difficult.

They're a lot more vocal these days. Kids hate authority figures. 

Especially authority figures that failed them. 

But I want to make it clear to them that they CAN ask for them. And there IS help. 

I was already halfway across the platform when I glimpsed familiar brown curls nestled under a green beanie. 

I knew it was him. He was wearing that exact same jacket, clinging to a wider frame. He was taller, his face more matured, with a five o’clock shadow, talking loudly on an expensive phone.

I took my eyes off of the girl for one second. 

One second. 

I turned back to her, and she was gone. Just like that. 

When I searched the crowd, I caught her blonde ponytail behind her. 

A man pulling her through strangers. 

I started forwards, when someone pulled me back. 

“No, Finn.” Charlie's voice was in my ear, suddenly. 

“She has the perfect shape and body for my father,” he murmured. His voice kept me paralyzed, while the girl was getting further and further away, before coming a speck, and then bleeding into nothing. 

“I want to see you fly, Finn,” Charlie whispered. 

I twisted around, and he was gone. But, when I left the train station, sitting on a bench was his old threaded backpack. 

Nothing inside, but I know why he left it. 

He's telling me he's watching me. 

Charlie is bragging that he's taking more kids right in front of me. 

I've looked everywhere for the girl, and I can't find her. 

When I asked a group of street kids, they were defensive, clearly not trusting me, before I warned them someone was kidnapping them. 

They told me three guys, and a girl (the blonde) have all vanished. 

I asked *when*, and that's when they started getting suspicious. 

They left without telling me, and I've spent the last week looking for these kids. 

The only way I'm going to find these kids is to find the sick bastard who took me. 

Before he does to them, what he did to Ben, Carly and Jason.

Here is WHY!,"I had a crap ton of midterms today, and I needed to take a break between my exams, so I made my way to a local coffee shop driving my BMW windows rolled down feeling the breeze on the way there. I stepped out looking handsome as hell winking at all the ladies and homoerotic men, I found on the way staring me down for obvious reasons! My break was 2 hours, and I sat myself down, reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Idiot while sipping on my coffee. 

  
I saw a beautiful girl with her friends, knowing I had a sophisticated work of literature, and I was wearing my best fit, white button-down shirt, dress pants, belt, and an elegant silk tie to match, I made my move like a wolf hunting prey, we made eye contact, and I went in for the kill, but in this case the romantic intrigue. I walked up saying, ""my good madame, I am Sir Gibson, I am a student at the University of Michigan, and I want to say you look very fine today. May I have the pleasure of accompanying you in a delicate chat while we sip on this good coffee?"" 

Her eyes sparkled before me impressed by me dapper use of the English vocabulary, as the kids say I was spitting game, she took a seat next to me, and I nearly lost track of time in our conversation, it was among the most proper and refined of conversations I had, but a good sir disturbed our conversation. He walks in dressed like a brute wearing a wife beater with unshaved arm pits, this man does not fit into this environment. He begins screeching ""you elitist prick get away from my girl!"" 

Gob smacked I respond ""do you know her? What here conundrum did I spawn myself into for the sake of a pretty girl!"" I straightened myself forward ready to fight with facts and logic.

The woman replies earnestly, ""I do not know this gentleman, he is a brute who has spawned from outside Ann Arbor, invading our glorious college town with pick-up trucks, and misogyny!""

He begins cracking his knuckles, and I begin to get ready to pounce, misogyny, and evil has come forward to invade our pleasant college town, and I am the final defense, the Saviour of Umich, the ultimate weapon the one they speak of. 

I begin spitting facts, putting this brute in his place, using spells I learned from D&D, and telling him ""You shall not pass this barrier, one for the educator, and one for the student. You have not shaved those pits, and you belong in a pit, away with you!""  

I watched a hole form beneath his two feet, and he was sucked under, Satan himself heard my pleas, and logic. As he was sunk below the girl kissed me holding my hands, thanking me for everything I have done, and the employees behind the counter clapped. I saved the day and hopped back in my BMW sunglasses on, windows rolled down to finish my last midterm. Another day in college completed.

It worked out fine and days were fast and it was easy to forget about food for the morning. Still I had food noise, but I could distract myself.

I was pretty depressed and food noise was constant, even on eating days. **But** on those rare occasions I could get past the noise, my body felt a lot better. 

This only lasted about 2 months before I had to have wisdom tooth surgery that had complications and I fell off the bandwagon. By then it was the holidays and you know how that goes. Life gets away from you. 

I’d like to feel good again, and I’d like to loose weight, but I don’t want it to consume my life like it had. Any advice?

I’m an English speaking black woman visiting Montreal for a weekend in April and I don’t have an itinerary. I’m just enjoying the city and am interested in checking out local coffee shops, speakeasy’s, clubs and maybe a bookstore or two.

For context, I love house / Amapiano / Afrobeats music for clubs, but I’m also interested in lounges / speakeasy’s where I can sit and drink and socialize. I also love video games and am interested in bringing back black art or some food home with me (i.e coffee, jams and jellies, chocolates etc.) and I’m open to trying a new restaurant or two (not too picky on cuisine with the exception of Indian food).

At first there wasn't much interaction but over time he would start to make stupid jokes around the girls wrestling team and I would find him staring at me. Jake was popular in school but he was definitely an asshole to everyone and he didn't even try to hide it. Towards the end of my senior year he started to talk to me a bit more and I definitely noticed him staring at me during practice and around that time he added me on snapchat fast forward to September of 2024 he randomly asked me to go to a concert with him and I said yes. The concert went really really well so we kept talking after. we eventually started dating and he was so sweet but it scared me off like it felt like he was love bombing me with doing things like showing up to my house when my family went on vaca and i wasn't the only one home to put flowers and chocolates in my car while i was sleeping to surprise me but in all reality all that did was scare me it got to the point one night where i felt kinda sick i had a long day with school and work and he pushed so hard to go on a date that night then proposed to take me to a fancy restaurant which i didn't end up liking then out to a halloween corn maze and i was just so tired by the end of the night that the night day i decided to end it with him because i felt like i couldn't hold up a relationship with him. Fast forward to mid January. I missed him, I missed the way he would look at me and the sweet things he would do and I know those aren't the right reasons to get back with someone but I decided to reach out and apologize for how I ended things before. 

We started talking again and it was nice, then I found out he was sick. He was passing out, his blood pressure was abnormally high and his blood glucose was weird. He went to the doctor and they ran a test and discovered his liver was failing. I'm an emt so I wasn't scared by his symptoms but the way he was handling them was stressing me out. He was still doing things his doctor told him not to do like wrestling and working out. There were times when he called me that he just threw up blood or passed out and I would offer to take him to the ER and sit with him but he never wanted to go. On February 4th at 7AM I got the call from my best friend's mom that my best friend had died in the early morning. It felt like something broke at that very moment. Someone who had been my best friend for years, someone who had been with me through thick and thin died and I felt like I was drowning. for the days following that he tried to give me support but i just wanted to be left alone. he stop giving me support and i was ok with that but then valentines day happened when maddie died it felt like time stopped for me so i wasn't prepared for valentines day i didn't get us reservations anywhere or have any plans but i did make him these cute cotton round flowers i saw on tik tok. I made 11 of them and it took me almost 6 hours to finish them all. On Valentine's Day he was almost pissy at me that i didnt have any plans for us but he could have been the one to step u-p and make them since I'm dealing with grief, college and work all at once. we ended up just driving around that night not really talking, we decided to get coffee at starbucks so while we were in the drive through i was talking to him turned to make the order then look back and him and in the middle of a sentence he stopped talking he head fell back i saw his eyes rolling into his head and his arm was twitching the i started saying his name loudly and he came back into it i gave him a automation either i was going to take him to the er and be there with him or i'm taking him and dropping him off at home because i'm not spending my night dealing with that. 

On the way back to his house I got a call from one of my sorority sisters asking if I wanted to go out with them since they were having a galentine's day dinner and taking pictures and I said sure I'll be there in a bit. After that he was mad that I'm choosing them over him and I told him that I'm not doing that. I'm dropping him off because I don't want the responsibility of dealing with him since he's not being responsible about his condition and it's not my job to watch him. 

The next few days I realized I couldn't handle my own shit plus his. I don't have it in me to deal with his shit and my own shit. I'm failing two classes and I'm on academic probation with my sorority. I can't risk sleeping anymore in my academic life and personal life than I already am. I know that is selfish but I feel like I have that right to be selfish right now. On the 20th he texted me about how things with us weren't right and how he's worried so I sent him ""this I don’t really think I have it in me for a relationship run like I’m so mad and sad all the time right now and you don’t deserve it. I don’t think I can give you the things you deserve in a relationship. I think if hadn’t started this right before Reagon died things would differently but I’m barely functioning rn and I don’t want to lead you on then I crash out and ghost you again because that’s not fair. Ik this is shitty of me but i barely have enough of myself for just me and there not much of me to share anymore."" and he responded with ""are you serious, this isn't fair you're abandoning me again, if you do this there no changing it"" and i told him that i'm aware of what i'm doing and it's what i need to do for myself. 

I just want to know if what I did was wrong. I'm aware I probably didn't handle it the best and at this point I can barely handle anything. currently while writing this i have covid and i sinus infection. It feels like my life is in shambles and I'm not sure how to fix it. I lost my best friend, my family doesn't really do emotions and it's the first death I'm having to deal with.i’m having problems sleeping because i keep having nightmares about the way she died i just feel like shit in every way.

1izxfh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1izxfh8/could_discover_the_gevi_espresso_machine_be_the/,Could Discover the Gevi Espresso Machine Be the Ultimate Home Barista Tool? A Full Review,"Using the Gevi GECME418E-U+GECGI406B-U7 espresso machine daily has been an enlightening experience for me as both a coffee enthusiast and a curious tester. This machine offers a blend of compact elegance and professional-level functionality, designed to transform your kitchen into a mini café. From the first brew to the most intricate latte art, it excels in many ways but also leaves room for a few improvements.

**Brewing Performance**  
The brewing process is where this machine truly shines. Its 20-bar pressure system delivers a consistent and aromatic espresso shot, rivaling some of the best café brews I’ve tasted. It took me a few trials to perfect the extraction time and tamping pressure, but once dialed in, the espresso was rich and full-bodied. I even experimented with different grind settings using the integrated burr grinder, which allowed for a wide range of customization. This feature is a dream for someone like me, who enjoys alternating between espresso and Americano.

[Check Gevi GECME418E-U+GECGI406B-U7 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ckmtrl53/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
Creating silky microfoam for a latte or cappuccino is quite straightforward thanks to the powerful steam wand. I’ve had my fair share of encounters with frothers that overheat milk or fail to produce the right consistency, but this machine’s wand is surprisingly advanced. It easily creates the smooth texture needed for latte art, with just the right temperature control. My kids even joined in, attempting to make hearts and swirls, though the results were more abstract than artistic!

**Features**  
This machine is packed with thoughtful features. The burr grinder includes 35 precise settings, making it easy to switch between fine espresso grounds and coarser grinds for a French press. The hot water function comes in handy for tea or a quick Americano. I also appreciated the removable drip tray, which accommodates larger mugs for those oversized coffee cravings. Another clever touch is the included accessories like the tamper, milk jug, and cleaning tools, which make the setup feel comprehensive and user-friendly.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
Most mornings in my home are chaotic, with everyone rushing around and plenty of background noise. That’s why I appreciated how quiet this machine is, especially when grinding beans. It doesn’t disrupt the household, even during early mornings. On the energy front, it performs admirably too, with an automatic shutoff feature that ensures no unnecessary power is consumed.

**Design & Build Quality**  
With its ivory beige finish and stainless steel accents, this espresso maker adds a touch of sophistication to the kitchen. Despite weighing 17.16 pounds, it feels sturdy yet sleek. However, I noticed the lightweight design can cause the machine to shift slightly when locking in the portafilter, requiring a bit of extra hold during setup.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Cleaning is a breeze, with removable components like the drip tray and froth nozzle making routine maintenance simple. The included cleaning brush and pin are lifesavers for ensuring the grinder and nozzle remain clog-free. However, the grinder occasionally requires a gentle tap to encourage beans to move, especially with oilier roasts.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
The water reservoir is easy to refill and holds enough for multiple shots, which is convenient for busy mornings. I found it manageable to detach and clean, though I would have appreciated a visible water level indicator for quicker checks.

**Coffee Quality**  
Taste is the ultimate test, and the Gevi machine delivers. The espresso was consistently robust and aromatic. I could taste the nuances in the beans, whether I used a light roast or something darker. Friends who visited for coffee often commented on how café-like the experience felt.

**Strong Points**

* The built-in burr grinder offers exceptional customization with 35 grind settings.
* Produces café-quality espresso with its 20-bar pressure.
* The steam wand creates silky microfoam effortlessly.
* Quiet operation and energy-efficient features are great for daily use.

**Areas of Concern**

* The grinder occasionally struggles with darker, oilier beans, requiring manual intervention.
* Lightweight design can cause slight movement when locking the portafilter.
* No clear water level indicator on the reservoir.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to other super-automatic espresso machines, such as those from Breville or DeLonghi, the Gevi holds its ground remarkably well. While it lacks some of the advanced programmability of higher-end models, its price point and feature set make it a strong contender. The burr grinder and steam wand are comparable to those in machines that cost significantly more. However, competitors like Breville might offer a sturdier build and slightly quieter grinding operation.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its price range, this machine is an excellent investment. It bridges the gap between entry-level and professional espresso makers, providing a balance of quality and affordability. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned coffee lover, the features justify the cost, especially considering the included accessories and robust performance.

1izxfgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1izxfgy/can_the_best_wireless_earbuds_from_jbl_live_up_to/,Can the best wireless earbuds from JBL live up to expectations? A detailed review,"Using the JBL Vibe 200TWS earbuds daily has given me plenty of insight into their performance. As someone who juggles music during workouts, podcasts on commutes, and the occasional phone call, I had high hopes for these true wireless earbuds. There's a lot to like here, but a few quirks might leave some users wanting more.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about these earbuds was their sleek and pocket-friendly design. The black matte finish gives them a modern look without being too flashy. They feel lightweight, and the rounded-tip earpiece shape makes them easy to insert. The charging case is compact, slipping easily into a pocket or small bag. However, while the case feels sturdy, it doesn't scream premium quality. It's functional but a bit basic for a product in this category.

**Fit & Comfort**  
Comfort is subjective, of course, but I found these earbuds to fit well. They come with three sizes of silicone tips, so you can find the best seal for your ears. I went through all three sizes before settling on the smallest ones, which fit snugly and stayed secure even during workouts. My wife tried them briefly and found the medium tips more suitable for her ears. While they’re generally comfortable for extended wear, I did notice slight irritation after wearing them continuously for several hours.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Battery life is one of this product's most impressive features. The earbuds themselves deliver up to 5 hours of playback on a single charge, while the case holds an additional 15 hours. This means I can go for days without needing to recharge, which is a lifesaver for someone like me who often forgets to plug things in. The quick charge feature is a nice touch—10 minutes in the case gets you about an hour of playback. However, I did wish the charging case had better visual indicators for battery levels.

[Check JBL Vibe 200TWS price on Amazon](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b097f4v3fj/)

**Sound Quality & Performance**  
The sound on these earbuds is, simply put, delightful. JBL's signature Deep Bass Sound delivers punchy lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. Whether I’m listening to upbeat pop tracks during workouts or calming classical music while working, the sound remains balanced and crisp. There’s no distortion even at higher volumes, which is a big plus. That said, audiophiles might find the bass slightly overpowering for certain genres. For the average user, though, the sound quality is more than adequate.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**  
These earbuds rely on passive noise cancellation, which depends on the physical seal created by the ear tips. While this does a decent job of blocking out background noise, it's nowhere near the level of active noise cancellation. I was able to drown out the hum of a coffee shop but could still hear traffic on a busy street. They lack an ambient mode, which would have been useful for outdoor activities like jogging.

**Features**  
The JBL Vibe 200TWS has touch controls for managing playback, calls, and voice assistants. While functional, the touch controls are overly sensitive. I found myself accidentally pausing songs or skipping tracks when adjusting the earbuds. Dual Connect technology lets you use either earbud independently, which I found handy during work calls.

**Durability & Water Resistance**  
With an IPX2 rating, these earbuds are resistant to light sweat and small splashes. They’ve survived a couple of gym sessions and an accidental drop into a puddle without any issues. However, they're not designed for heavy rain or intense physical activities that produce a lot of sweat.

**Warranty**  
The earbuds come with a standard one-year warranty, which is fairly typical. I haven’t had any issues requiring customer service, but it’s nice to have that safety net just in case.

**Advantages**

* The compact and lightweight design makes them portable.
* JBL Deep Bass Sound delivers rich and immersive audio quality.
* Battery life is excellent, offering up to 20 hours of combined playback.
* Dual Connect allows the use of a single earbud for calls or music.

**Negative Attributes**

* Touch controls are overly sensitive and prone to accidental activation.
* The lack of active noise cancellation might be a dealbreaker for some.
* Limited water resistance means they aren’t ideal for intense activities.

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing these earbuds to their competitors, they hold up reasonably well. For instance, the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro offers active noise cancellation and customizable EQ settings but comes at a higher price point. Apple’s AirPods are known for their seamless integration with iPhones but lack the robust bass of the JBL Vibe 200TWS. If you’re willing to spend more, the Sony WF-1000XM4 offers better noise cancellation and sound quality. However, in the budget-friendly category, these JBL earbuds provide excellent value for their price.

**Value for Money**  
For what they offer, the JBL Vibe 200TWS earbuds are a solid investment. They might not have all the bells and whistles of high-end models, but they strike a good balance between affordability and performance. If you’re looking for reliable earbuds with great sound and long battery life, these are worth considering.

\- [Milky Beach ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3QyjdXq28W7Y5Lu7)for drinks on the beach. Each drink is around $10-12 USD and you can take them to go out on the sand. Cocktails were better than some of the other places around.  
\- The [Sandbar massages](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UHZZm9YYUdKFbDhUA): Went here twice for full body massages, they are $38 per person plus tip and overall a great experience both times. I would recommend going in the morning <11 am to avoid the heat and the music that gets pretty loud from the bars below. Bring Pesos or Dollars to tip.  
\- [Mi Casa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YmzLeEicVHstM3h26) (restaurant): Food here was great, got a Molcajete with Arrachera (steak) and it was delicious. Servers are very friendly and the ambience is awesome.  
\-[ Mother Flower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/htPxj5jK8FtpH2BM9) (Restaurant): Small spot with good food and amazing cocktails. Would go back here just for the drinks.  
\- [Tacos Lalos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DQzLzYiEHmAaHEFB6) (Restaurant): Great casual dining spot for breakfast or lunch. No frills but the food and margs are reasonably priced.  
\- Mango on a stick and churros from beach vendors: You pay a slight premium but a fresh mango with Tajin and churros with sauce are a perfect snack for the beach. they were both $5 each when I bought them (\~100 pesos)   
\- [Bar Esquina Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z4yeBRqEnYvv1nZt8): Next to the restaurant they have their coffee shop and we got green juices/ smoothies here every day. Their bakery items were good, we got the vanilla concha which was tasty.  
\- Schedule a round trip [shuttle](https://www.cabotransfers.com/) to and from the airport: Otherwise you may be stuck getting fleeced by the people once you arrive. Plus it is kind of nice to know that you have transportation covered and don't have to worry about planning it. Bring some cash to tip.  
\-Cabo Treasure (Souvenirs): The place was reasonable in price and the lady working there was very nice. The blown glass here is all from Guadalajara and handmade.

  
Dont's:  
\-  buy souvenirs from vendors walking the beach. They are grossly overpriced and if you show any bit of interest they will continue to try to sell them to you. Would recommend going into town and going to some of the smaller souvenir shops and haggling there.  
\- [La Lupita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SF3V5d7H9ZX9LKYE9) (Restaurant): Overall the vibes are good here but I was not super impressed with the tacos. They have their basic menu and then mostly specialty tacos but I didnt love any of the specialty ones. My favorite was the Al Pastor and that was the cheapest of the ones I got. Also music can be very loud if they have a live band  
\- [Bar Esquina ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rQdQCpHdTy6bSHQf6)(restaurant): Went here for dinner and it was by far the most expensive food we had and honestly it wasn't that great. It is italian/american and the portions were small, food was good but not worth the price. The vibes were nice though. 

  
Other tips:  
\- Staying in an airbnb was nice and nearly the same price as a hotel (or cheaper)  
\- Have some pesos on hand to tip (im sure dollars work too in most places) but for smaller establishments, cash is a lot easier to tip with  
\- Use a debit card that doesn't charge foreign/atm fees (Charles Schwab or Fidelity are 2 good ones)  
\- Always pay in Pesos when using a credit card as you will mostly likely get a better exchange rate than if they do the conversion   
\- Wouldn't recommend drinking tap water. Safe to brush your teeth and stuff but not for consumption. ",1,1740709855.0,cabosanlucas,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’m from Peru, and my brother started a business by creating his own Peruvian coffee brand. Now, he has four different types of coffee.



I’ve been thinking about the future because one day, I’d love to work in Bangkok as a digital nomad (I’m a graphic designer). This made me wonder—what if I opened a coffee shop in Bangkok, importing my brother’s coffee brand? I know this is just an idea that popped into my head, but I love design, and I’ve noticed that brands in Thailand are so well executed.



So, my question is: **Has anyone started a business in Bangkok as a foreigner? How did you do it?**



I saw that a Thai actor Sky Wongravee (IG: u/burnt.bkk) has his own sandwich brand, and the branding looks bold and solid! So, instead of starting from scratch, I was wondering—**is it possible to buy the operating rights of an already established franchise and start from there? (this would be option2)**



If this is possible, would I need a work visa for it?



I have tons of questions in my mind, but for now, I’d love to hear from people with experience. I really like the idea of showcasing how amazing Peruvian coffee is!

I’m not a smoker, not even cigarettes, but the whole idea of altering your mind felt like something I had to experience. Everyone talks about it, so why not try it once to see what all the fuss is about?

I walked into a small coffee shop near the center, the kind where everyone is on their own vibe, and time doesn’t seem to exist. I ordered a pre-rolled mixed Indica joint for 12 euros. Supposedly it’s the kind that makes you chill out and relax. The bartender handed it to me with no fuss, no instructions. Just a joint. I lit it and started smoking.

At first, it felt almost performative. I wasn’t even sure if I was inhaling right. The smoke was harsh, and it felt like something my body wasn’t used to. I kept smoking anyway, not really knowing what to expect.

Then the first wave hit. It wasn’t euphoric or relaxing, just this sudden full-body jolt, like someone was pulling my skin from the inside. My face stretched into a forced smile, but there was no real feeling behind it. I remember thinking, ""Is this it?""

Minutes passed. Then the second wave came, and it was stronger. Sounds started to loop , the clinking of glasses, the bass of the music , everything became distorted, like an audio hallucination. My sense of time collapsed. I looked at the clock, looked away, and when I looked back, no time had passed. But I was still fully conscious, trying to observe everything for the experience.

I decided to leave, carrying the half-smoked joint like it was some kind of cursed object. Walking back to my hostel was a trip in itself. I had to cross a pedestrian tunnel, something that should’ve taken 20 seconds. But inside, it felt like eternity. Every step dragged on. The walls seemed to close in, and I started losing track of myself. I genuinely thought I was stuck in that tunnel, trapped in some never-ending loop where time had stopped but my body kept moving.

When I finally got back to my room, I couldn’t stop laughing, but nothing else came. No relaxation, no calming effects, nothing positive. My mind was slow, my senses were all over the place, and my body felt heavy, almost numb. My eyes hurt, and my vision was blurry, like when you stare at the sun for too long.

I slept for a few hours and woke up... feeling nothing at all. I finished the second half of the joint while writing this. Same result — just slower thoughts, dull limbs, and a sense of regret.

I don’t get how anyone could want this regularly. Maybe I had the wrong expectations. Maybe weed isn’t for people who are too analytical, who want to watch the high instead of just letting go. Its Was A FLOP

What bothers me most isn’t that I didn’t enjoy it — it’s that I still don’t know if I really experienced it. Maybe I should try a space cake next time?",1,1740709318.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

# 🚀 [OpenAI Just Released GPT-4.5](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-5-release)

OpenAI has officially launched GPT-4.5, featuring improved reasoning, faster response times, and better multimodal capabilities. The model is expected to bridge the gap between GPT-4 and the upcoming GPT-5.

Available now to Pro users ($200/mo tier) and developers on paid tiers via API.  
  
GPT-4.5 is a leap forward in scaling unsupervised learning. Reasoning models (like o1 + o3-mini) are great for STEM/logic...  
  
But unsupervised learning increases world model accuracy and intuition — leading to better EQ and a broader knowledge base (and less hallucinations).  
  
OpenAI says early testers reported GPT 4.5 interactions feeling more natural and intuitive.  
  
In human preference testing:  
  
— 70.8% preferred GPT-4.5 for professional tasks  
— 58.4% chose it for creative work  
— 55.9% picked it for everyday queries  
  
With the focus on unsupervised learning over reasoning, 4.5 isn't a step up from previous models on math or science.  
  
However, it does surpass o3-mini and o1 on SWE-Lancer, OpenAI's recently released freelance coding task benchmark.  
  
GPT-4.5 currently supports search, file/image uploads, and canvas for writing/code — no multimodal features like Voice Mode, video, or screensharing yet.  
  
OpenAI expects to roll out the new model more broadly to Plus and Team plans next week.

**What this means:** GPT-4.5 represents a major step in AI performance, with enhanced abilities in code generation, language understanding, and complex problem-solving. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/27](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

Inception Labs has unveiled an AI-powered ultra-fast diffusion model, significantly accelerating the speed of image and video generation without sacrificing quality.

* LLMs generate text one token at a time, but Mercury’s diffusion approach generates entire blocks in parallel for increased speed, efficiency, and control.
* Their first model, [Mercury Coder](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.a3gBHu6_kDRL6l3yEfNWAWlfQ6Mm4aIKKJ5L4yqwrMV6VC8P7ZWPvoF-3HgBXtQ6YbKX-XFbCaqbIAT2q6Yo3IDE0iY_qAdMv7ogqLkpZM5kxeOPH27eP8aX_4DbwOPCeva0E9GV3mfHqjW1EW6G5fYGdGYrNaM1kTZ-SoEBTT39vgnDGcYgU8rbXhlpunynrFdtasKcNRHir_WmS4rdsg9RwbI22sK9o_ciI8WtUKn2TP3CTpiSpzEwpucFkANX/4ed/y0HH6OWKTPinhGyjlPRrqw/h19/h001.gMzG-Yl0qSm_2SjyzqkWcfbzU3eUaFEpYDsLpNg0kiw), matches or beats the coding performance of models like GPT-4o Mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku at 5-10x the speed.
* Inception was founded by Stanford professor Stefano Ermon, who researched how to apply diffusion (commonly used for image and video generation) to text.
* Mercury models can serve as drop-in replacements for traditional models in areas like code generation, customer support, and enterprise automation.

1izwyuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1izwyuv/how_to_use_ai_to_write_linkedin_posts_that/,How to Use AI to Write LinkedIn Posts That Actually Get Engagement,"# 1. Start with a Personal Hook

Most AI-generated posts jump straight into facts, but LinkedIn thrives on storytelling. Instead of asking AI to “write a post about leadership,” try:  
👉 *""Tell a story about a time a leader made a tough decision that paid off, but the risk was high.""*

This forces the AI to create something more relatable and engaging.

# 2. Use the “Problem → Insight → Solution” Structure

Great LinkedIn posts don’t just share information; they create a narrative. Try prompting AI like this:  
💡 *""What’s a common misconception about \[your industry\]? Explain why it’s wrong and what people should do instead.""*

This keeps your post informative but also conversation-driven.

# 3. Make It Sound Like You

AI defaults to formal, robotic language unless you direct it otherwise. Try adding:  
🗣 *""Write this in a casual, first-person tone, as if I’m talking to a colleague over coffee.""*

This removes the AI-generated stiffness that LinkedIn users instantly scroll past.

# 4. End with a Strong Call to Action

The best LinkedIn posts invite discussion. Instead of ending with *“What do you think?”*, try:

* *""Have you faced a similar challenge? How did you handle it?""*
*  *""Would you have made the same decision? Why or why not?""*

AI can help generate ideas, but it’s the *right prompts* that make the difference.

Or times I cut sugar (very briefly) from my diet. Last January is when it started for me. At first, I thought maybe because I was eating cleaner, cut coffee, etc, that I had a slight headache. After a couple weeks went by, I was baffled. How come I still had a headache? And how come Tylenol etc isn’t exactly helping? Another couple weeks passed and panic set it. I went to a clinic, they arranged bloodwork and a CT scan - results showed nothing. I was relieved, you know, no brain tumour or whatever. During this time is when I researched and found out about NDPH. Like what? That can’t be a thing. When I told my husband he told me I needed to drink more water (lol). I mentioned it to several people in my life. No one really gets it. It’s hard to explain. You feel like you’re being dramatic… “24/7 headache.. 24.. 7….” Well, I left it alone. I have brought it up every so often, like just so you all know, I still have this headache. And now it’s been a little over a year. Tomorrow I am going to go back to the clinic.

The coffee thermoses, can pyramids, night springs video games, and the other dlc collectibles add nothing to the game besides another number in the statistics menu.

The gameplay really lowers the rating of this game, there's no reason/incentive (other than misc kill # enemies with x weapon trophies) to engage in combat. For every encounter, besides the few defense and boss encounters, the most efficient strategy (time and resources) is popping a flare and running to the next checkpoint. Nightmare mode ""increases difficulty"" by simply increasing the shields, health, and damage of the enemies. The gameplay never really engaged me at all, it really is the low point of this game

# Teas with the Most Caffeine

Not all teas are created equal when it comes to caffeinated teas. Some teas have more caffeine naturally, to give you that extra energy boost to start your day or power through the afternoon slump. Among them, Matcha and some black teas like Assam and Darjeeling stand out for their high caffeine content. These are naturally high caffeine teas, no jitters like coffee.

[Oolong tea](https://dofotea.com/collections/oolong-tea) is another option to consider. Its caffeine content is between green and black tea, so a balanced choice for those who want moderate caffeine. Oolong tea is also good for you, weight loss and cholesterol reduction. The processing method of oolong tea affects its flavor and caffeine extraction, that’s why it’s unique.

Knowing the caffeine content in your tea allows you to choose the best brew for you. Here are the most caffeinated teas and what makes them special.

White teas are often misunderstood when it comes to caffeine content, they have less caffeine than black teas. But some white teas can have more caffeine depending on the preparation and the part of the plant used. That’s why white teas are an interesting option for those who want to manage their caffeine intake and still enjoy the flavor.

# Matcha: The Caffeine King

Matcha has the highest caffeine content of all teas. From Japan, this powdered green tea packs a big caffeine punch because you’re consuming the whole tea leaf in powder form. This way you get the most caffeine and nutrients. Matcha is the go to for those who need a big energy boost.

Shading the tea plants for weeks before harvest increases Matcha’s caffeine and flavour. Consuming the whole tea leaf gives you more caffeine and antioxidants than regular green tea. Matcha is a powerhouse of goodness.

Adding Matcha to your daily routine will give you sustained energy without the crash. L-theanine in Matcha balances out the caffeine and gives you relaxed alertness and focus and mood.

# [Black Tea](https://dofotea.com/collections/black-tea) Varieties

Black teas, especially Assam and Darjeeling, are known for their strong flavor and high caffeine. An 8oz cup of tea has 25-60mg of caffeine, so if you need to stay alert all day, this is a good one. Unlike iced black tea which has the same amount of caffeine as hot, these varieties have a consistent caffeine kick.

Longer oxidation in black teas increases both flavor and caffeine. Whether you like the malty Assam or the floral Darjeeling, black teas are a satisfying and energizing experience.

# [Pu-Erh Tea](https://dofotea.com/collections/puer): Aged and Energizing

Pu-Erh tea stands out not just for its unique aging process but also for its high caffeine content. Ripe Pu-Erh, in particular, offers an energizing boost that can rival other high-caffeine teas. As Pu-Erh tea ages, its flavor and caffeine levels evolve, providing a rich, complex taste that is deeply satisfying.

Pu-Erh is ideal for those seeking to explore unique flavors while enjoying high caffeine benefits.

# Factors Influencing Tea Caffeine Levels

Caffeine levels in tea vary due to factors like tea type, processing methods, and brewing techniques. Knowing these elements helps you choose the right tea for your energy needs. Here are the key factors determining caffeine content in your tea.

The type of tea—black, green, white, or another variety—primarily determines caffeine levels. Regional cultivation practices, processing methods, and brewing techniques also play crucial roles. Understanding these influences helps you make informed decisions about your caffeine intake. For those looking to reduce caffeine intake, rooibos tea is a great caffeine-free alternative that offers health benefits such as protecting the liver from oxidative stress and potentially lowering blood pressure.

# Plant Species and Cultivation

The Camellia sinensis plant is the primary source of caffeine in tea. The tea plant Camellia Assamica variety, with its larger leaf size, produces slightly more caffeine and is commonly cultivated in regions like India and Sri Lanka for its high caffeine content.

Younger tea leaves, found in tender shoots, contain higher caffeine levels compared to older leaves. Caffeine acts as a defense mechanism, increasing its concentration in younger leaves. Darjeeling tea, made from young Sinensis leaves, is known for its higher caffeine content.

# Processing Techniques

Oxidation and processing methods affect caffeine content in tea. Oxidation in particular affects caffeine levels based on how the leaves are handled.

Fermentation methods also change caffeine levels and that’s why there are variations among tea types. These methods along with growth conditions determine the final caffeine content in your tea.

# Brewing Methods

Brewing methods matter a lot. Longer steeping time and hotter water extracts more caffeine and gives you a stronger more caffeinated tea.

Amount of tea leaves used also affects caffeine content. More leaves means more caffeine. Adjust steeping time, water temperature and amount of leaves and you can control caffeine content to your liking.

# Tea vs Coffee Caffeine Content

Caffeine levels in tea and coffee are very different so you can make an informed choice about how much caffeine you want to consume. An 8oz cup of brewed coffee has about 95mg of caffeine, most teas have 30-50mg. This means you can choose how much caffeine you want.

Coffee gives you a quick energy hit, tea releases caffeine slower so you get steadier energy. Tea is better for sustained energy without the quick spikes and crashes of coffee.

# Tea vs Coffee Caffeine

A typical cup of brewed coffee has about 95mg of caffeine, black tea has about 47mg. Some teas like Matcha can have higher caffeine levels, sometimes similar to coffee. But caffeine levels can vary greatly even within the same tea variety.

Espresso has about 58mg of caffeine per shot. Now you can adjust your caffeine intake to your energy needs and preferences.

# Effects on the Body

Tea’s caffeine is absorbed more slowly compared to coffee, providing steadier energy levels and avoiding rapid spikes. L-theanine in tea mitigates some stimulating effects of caffeine, promoting a relaxed state of alertness. This combination enhances cognitive performance and mental clarity without the jitteriness of coffee.

Caffeine is absorbed quickly, often within 20 minutes to an hour, stimulating the central nervous system and improving focus and alertness. High-caffeine teas like Matcha, containing both caffeine and L-theanine, provide a balanced boost in focus while minimizing stress.

# High Caffeine Teas

High caffeine teas do more than just give you energy. They can boost cognitive function, alertness and overall physical performance. The unique compounds in tea like L-theanine help to calm down the effects of caffeine.

Adding these teas to your daily routine can give you health benefits from better mental clarity to better physical endurance. Here are the benefits.

https://preview.redd.it/5zxvatbffsle1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=047fc38ffec131faca09ea3b653380ba69ef50e3

# Focus and Energy

High caffeine teas are popular for mental clarity and physical energy. They help you focus better and contribute to physical stamina so you have extra energy during activities.

High caffeine teas can improve both mental and physical performance so add them to your diet.

# Antioxidant Properties

Caffeine in high-caffeine teas acts as an antioxidant, helping neutralize free radicals and protect cells from damage. The antioxidants in these teas may reduce inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases.

# Weight Management and Metabolism

Certain high-caffeine teas can aid weight management by increasing metabolic rate and enhancing fat oxidation. The combination of caffeine and catechins elevates metabolic rates and assists in fat breakdown, potentially aiding weight loss efforts.

Adding these teas to a balanced diet and active lifestyle can effectively help achieve weight management goals.

# Caffeine Balancing

Balancing your caffeine is key to enjoying high caffeine teas without the side effects. Tea has less caffeine than coffee so it’s better for those looking to cut down. But individual reactions to caffeine are huge so you need to know your limits.

Knowing the factors that affect caffeine levels and adjusting your intake accordingly will allow you to enjoy high caffeine teas according to your lifestyle. Here are some ways to balance your caffeine.

# Know Your Limits

Knowing your limits is key to avoiding the negative effects. Signs of too much intake are headaches, insomnia and increased heart rate. Effects can happen even at low doses so knowing your tolerance is important.

Pay attention to these signs and adjust your caffeine intake to avoid issues.

# Reducing Caffeine Sensitivity

Gradually decreasing caffeine intake may help lessen sensitivity and withdrawal symptoms. By slowly reducing your caffeine consumption, you can help your body adjust and decrease sensitivity, leading to fewer withdrawal symptoms.

This gradual approach can make the transition easier and more sustainable.

High-caffeine teas offer a unique and enjoyable way to stay energized and focused throughout the day. From Matcha to Pu-Erh, these teas provide a range of benefits, from enhanced cognitive function to aiding in weight management. Understanding the factors that influence caffeine levels, comparing tea to coffee, and knowing the best times to enjoy these teas can help you make informed choices about your caffeine consumption. By balancing your intake and recognizing your limits, you can enjoy the numerous health benefits of high-caffeine teas without the negative side effects. Many herbal teas are naturally caffeine-free, making them suitable for those looking to avoid caffeine.

I have the shitties sleep possible. Every little sound wakes me up - like my dog drinking water or walking around; my partner moving in his sleep; OR literally some people outside talking (even though all you can hear from the apartment - very muffled distant voices). I can't wear earplugs - it's extremely painful for my ears, can't explain it. If I want to sleep - I need complete silence and piece, otherwise it's a disaster to fall asleep and especially hard to STAY asleep.

Unfortunately in the country where i currently live - it's impossible to ""make an appointment"" with a doctor - you need to go through rounds of hell to eventually get to the one who can actually help you - so I have no idea what to do here and what can I do in the meanwhile...

I stick to a specific routine. 
I read before bed. 
I don't use any gadgets at least for an hour before going to bed. 
I eat relatively healthy. I do still have some products with sugar and fastfood from time to time, but cmn who doesn't? 
I drink a lot of water. 
I don't drink coffee/smoke/drink alcohol at all; I mostly drink some mixed-herbes teas, not even sure any of them contain caffeine.
I do some sports (at least 2-3 times/week).
I work from home in IT, so I get a relatively normal dosage of stress. Like, average, I can't say I overstressed or overwhelmed each day. 

I'm really trying here. I know that a lot depends on my lifestyle and I have no idea what else to adjust. 
I tried some special teas for sleeping - no effect, none. I have no idea what else to do and this just becomes unbearable.

The summer before my dad (59M) divorced my mom (56F) my dad would take me out on weekends to a lookout in my town for coffee because he wasn't home during the weeks. My dad and I would spend a few hours chatting and listening to music. Because my dad was spending this time with me, my mom and my brother felt jealous (which my mom only told me how she felt back in mid 2024 \[the divorce was in Jan of 2024\]). I have apologised many times to them both for this because I know it was part of the downfall of my parent's marriage and it impacted my brother greatly.

In the past few years, my relationship with my brother has gotten kind of better. I was a smartass when I was a kid and I have changed. My brother has gotten farther into depression and participates in reckless behavior and has even told me he wants to have a DNR (do not resuscitate) order. He stopped college at the end of the school year last year and moved back home for trade school.

Tonight, we got takeaway sushi for dinner and I drove to go get it. My brother and I got the same roll so they put it in the same plate. I divided the rolls up evenly, his on the lid of the container and mine in the actual container, and we both ate. After I was done eating, I moved my empty part of the container towards him so when he was done he could put the lid on and we could throw it away without a mess. He angrily pushed the container towards me with the lid on top (I wish I was lying to make my side of the story more appealing). I asked him calmly what I did wrong and he said I was acting like I was better than everyone else and that I was a little brat (he said this repeatedly) and called me jobless and claimed I had no social life (I take AP classes and multiple big tests a week so I am studying at home 6/7 nights). He then says, ""This is why I hate women"". I am a feminist (not radical) so that evoked something in me and I said ""Ok, misogynist"". I know I should not have said that and I apologised. Then he says I rely on my dad to comfort me and tell me everything is going to be ok and that once thats gone it will be a rude awakening for me (I have been no/low contact with my father since Jan 2024). My father has always favored me to my brother and I have apologised for this even though it is not my actions that are making him feel unloved by my father, in fact, my brother has more of a relationship now with him than I do.

Then I flew off the handle. I mean screaming, so angry I am crying kind of anger. I know it was not the best thing to do in this situation but I was tired of taking my brother's crap for so long (he's been acting like this for the past few months). You have to piss me off really bad for me to scream at you, it's something I have been and am still working on in therapy. My brother criticised me for it saying I was acting like I was 12 and told me to grow up. I told him I was tired of him taking out all his problems on me, he denied it. My mom told me I need to work on being less snarky and that I should focus on my own character and not anyone else's, and that's probably true, but idk. AITAH?",1,1740708127.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Are you a coffee aficionado obsessed with the perfect espresso? Do you dream of pulling shots just like your favorite barista, right in the comfort of your home? If so, then the Breville Double Boiler espresso machine might be the answer to your caffeinated prayers. In this thorough guide, we'll delve deep into the world of the Breville double boiler, comparing top models, dissecting key features, exploring alternatives, and ultimately helping you determine if this prosumer espresso machine is the right investment for your coffee journey.

[[Explore Top Rated breville double boiler on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=breville double boiler)
## Why Choose a Breville Double Boiler Espresso Machine?

Before we dive into specific models and comparisons, let's first understand why the Breville double boiler has garnered such a dedicated following. The core advantage lies in its dual boiler system itself. Unlike single boiler machines, which require time-consuming temperature adjustments between brewing espresso and steaming milk, a Breville dual boiler boasts separate boilers dedicated to each function. This means you can pull consistently perfect espresso shots while concurrently steaming milk for lattes, cappuccinos, and other milk-based coffee drinks - a critical feature for efficiency and workflow, especially appreciated by those who enjoy crafting multiple beverages.

Beyond speed and efficiency, the dual boiler system also contributes to superior temperature stability. Espresso extraction is a delicate process, heavily influenced by water temperature. A consistent temperature within a narrow range (typically around 200°F or 93°C) is essential for optimal flavor extraction, preventing both under-extraction (sourness) and over-extraction (bitterness). The Breville double boiler, with its PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) temperature control, ensures this stability, leading to richer, more balanced, and more nuanced espresso. Users looking for an espresso machine with PID often find this a defining feature.

Furthermore, the Breville double boiler machines are celebrated for their user-friendly design and comprehensive feature sets.They often include programmable features, pre-infusion settings, adjustable brewing temperatures, and intuitive interfaces, giving you unparalleled control over every aspect of the brewing process. This customization is highly prized by those who want to fine-tune their espresso to their precise preferences. Ultimately, the breville double boiler empowers you to become a true home barista.

I finally became ready to date/enter a relationship last year and refuse to use dating apps, so I don't have much experience with men these days. God, I hope he doesn't see this, lol. Anyway, I seem to attract younger men, like late 20s - early 30s, which is fair because I only look about 35 and I'm young at heart. I haven't pursued dating them, though, as it felt like I always carried the conversation when we talked. So last weekend, I was at a spiritual gathering that I regularly attend and ran into a customer from my work; we shared a great conversation and good vibes, and he asked if I'd like to go out for coffee sometime, so we exchanged numbers. 
I texted him the following day and asked if he'd like to grab that coffee, but he had to stay by his phone/computer for work and asked if I wanted to come over instead. I told him I probably would, but I don't have a car, which he understood. So I didn't get to hang out with him, but we continued texting. I asked how old he was and he's 29! I let him know my age and told him I didn't want to be a creep (probably my first mistake, as I'm too honest/awkward sometimes). He told me I looked 33 and that age is just a number, which made me feel better. So the next day, I messaged him again, only this time I didn't ask to hang out and it was mostly small talk. There was something about his eyes and his personality, and the fact that he seems pretty self-aware and mature for his age. He hasn't messaged me in 3 days and it's just confusing because he asked for my number and asked me out to coffee, but he's not really showing much of an interest, and I'm not sure if it was because of what I said about not wanting to be a creep.

We're going on a long weekend trip to a cabin to celebrate, but l'd like to get him something small but meaningful as well.

He's in his early 30s, and very much has a BIFL mindset. He works in a technical role, runs a lot, plays guitar, enjoys history and old movies, is really into good sound systems, and has started doing some woodworking lately (larger stuff like desks, tables, etc., so he's got the power saws & whatnot for that already). He's kind of an ""old soul"" type, and likes being warm and cozy.

He's a little tricky to gift for -- he makes a lot more than I do, so he's able to get himself good-quality items when he wants them, so he's fairly well-stocked already! He already has a set of Le Creuset, nice kitchen knives, a Leatherman multitool that he carries every day, good quality luggage/work backpack, and is currently working on fixing his Garmin running watch. I gave him Darn Toughs for his birthday.

The only ideas I've had so far are 1) a good leather wallet to replace his aging one (happy to hear your brand suggestions!) but he recently mentioned he might want to switch to a more minimalist mag-safe one, so l'm not sure about that, or 2) a pair of good leather slipper boots (probably LL Bean), to replace his current ones that are wearing out.

He doesn't really drink alcohol or coffee, and doesn't have any particular favorite sports teams, so those kind of ""easy target"" gifts are out.

Price range is probably in the under-$200 region. Any suggestions? Thanks all!",7,1740707745.0,BuyItForLife,5,1.0,False

We both still care for each other but have issues we need to deal with. We were trying to be friends, but he wants to be together. Am I being manipulated?","Hi all, this might get confusing, I am not a good story teller and this is my first Reddit post. I really need someone to talk to. Please be kind and patient with me, I’m trying my best. 

My bf (27M) and I (26F) dated for almost 4 years. For some background information: He’s been my longest relationship and the most serious. I met him through tinder and it was a hook up at first, but he became my best friend and it was easy to talk to him about life. When we got serious with each other it was great at first, but it turned toxic quickly once a lot of issues and boundaries weren’t getting addressed. I felt like when I brought things up that I had an issue with he would get mad at me instead of addressing there was a problem. I didn’t blame him and wanted to look at it like us vs. The problem but it never worked like that with him and I think a lot of problems escalated from that. 

When it ended we both said some hurtful things, and he really did a number on my feelings by how he acted and what he said. I was mainly frustrated and at the end of my rope with the responsibilities of having to take care of him (more like a mother than a girlfriend), something we never agreed to. To me the way he was acting was childish. Unfortunately, I never felt like he put me first with things and I said so as much. I told him he was selfish (not the first time I’ve said it). Us breaking up didn’t come out of the blue and it’s not the first time we’ve broken up either. But legitimately living together was new for both of us and our problems only grew under one roof. Bottom line is that I wanted a partner that I felt unconditional love with, and someone who understood how to make me feel safe and happy. Towards the end of our relationship I recognise I really got on him/ annoyed at him because I was doing majority of cleaning the apartment even though I work 2 jobs, one on the weekend that involves 12 hour shifts. I’m exhausted from my work and only asked for help in the apartment on a consistent basis because his ‘schedule’ means he’s at home constantly. He would stay up all night and then sleep all day. He owns his own business and I guess he had enough work but he was usually always home sleeping during the day. When he moved in I had laid down some guidelines. If he was going to be home he needed to help clean up his messes (wash dishes, etc.) and let my dog out so she wasn’t stuck inside for 12 hours a day when I’m at work. My mom used to do that but because he moved in he said he could instead of her coming over all the time. I also made it clear it was important to me that I have time to myself in the apartment. I am an independent girl and he knew this from the day we met. I like my alone time and it’s clear to me now how much of a problem I guess that was. It meant him taking the time to do something outside of the apartment if he wasn’t working, instead of sleeping all day. He agreed to these things but it totally fell apart while we lived together. I’m not joking, he really never left the apartment unless it was to go to work or get coffee/ food. I never got time alone unless I went somewhere and I didn’t always want to be driving around. So I ended up cleaning up after 2 people on a daily basis, on my days off, while he slept because he’d stay up all night. I don’t mind those who have that lifestyle but it’s not mine and it wasn’t fair of him to put his on me without helping a little. Towards the end of the relationship I felt like I was being his mother and just cleaning up after him and nagging him all the time. I was strained because I never had time to myself but constantly needed to be thinking about him. I don’t want to feel that way in my home. It would upset him as well, which I can understand because it doesn’t feel great to get nagged constantly or hear that someone you love needs space. He would never listen to me and immediately got defensive (possibly gaslighting? I’m honestly not sure, but anytime I had an issue he would immediately bring up his issues about me that he had and we’d never address my issue because “I always have issues with him” and according to him I make things into a power play). He’ll bring up me not caring about him or making comments that he just wanted to talk to someone who cared about him and validated him and clearly he didn’t have that. If you knew me you’d see how much I do care about him, and I tell him/show him all the time. But once a fight happens he throws it in my face. I am a people pleaser and get easily manipulated once I feel like I’ve hurt someone or made life harder for that person. It kills me because one of the first times I ever told him that I felt invalidated when I brought something up to him (because of how he’d respond) he turned around and started using that anytime I tried bringing something up. 

 I genuinely do understand his side and how he could be hurt from things I said or did in the relationship. He’s a sensitive man and has been through some awful things outside of our relationship when we were together. Both of us are dealing with mental health issues as well. I fully know that you can’t change someone, but someone’s treatment and behaviour towards you can change and I don’t think I’m asking a lot for that to be better. I’ve always owned up to my mistakes and tried many ways to do things differently or work on an issue with him. I’m an honest person and I do love him sincerely and he’s my first real love and I don’t think that will ever go away. When he moved out we worked together so that it could be amicable while he got his things and found a place to live. After all I still consider him one of my best friends. I made it clear I was single when we discussed things, and we even talked about how we’d feel if we met other people. We still wanted to try to be friends, and I do admit to sleeping with him when he would come over. We had great sexual chemistry most of the time, but I know we view sex differently and I think I made a mistake by that. I hadn’t wanted the relationship to end, neither of us did, but we recognised that we weren’t happy or healthy living like that. So it was hard for me to fully let go of him (hence the sex and hanging out). I don’t think that I was trying to lead him on since I was bringing things up and having conversations with him when he would come over to get some things he’d left. I don’t want him to be sad or upset with me. I know I am important to him but the way he treats me sometimes doesn’t reflect that. The last time I saw him it really hit me how much he puts himself first or doesn’t understand what my issues have been. Im realising it’s not the future I want. We had talked a couple of days ago and I knew I shouldn’t have because I was cranky and tired and stressed and felt like I’d only get annoyed, but there were something things I wanted to talk about. But afterwards he texted me something really sweet and thoughtful, offering to do things I wanted to try and take away some stress. I was so torn because I love him and it was so sweet but it was a high expectation to put on me, especially when I voiced there was so much going on in my life at the moment. I know he was trying to be thoughtful but I don’t know how I feel anymore and I took a day to respond.  I was worried whatever I said would cause him to get upset and I guess I really do know him since he ended up basically texting me ‘never mind I guess’, which I then felt I had to respond to, so in a nice way I said that was a very sweet and thoughtful offer but it wasn’t what I needed at the moment. He got really mad at me and just went off on me and it felt like we were breaking up all over again. I feel terrible for hurting his feelings and I do love and care for him but I also can’t tell if I’m being manipulated. I feel like he’s guilting me because he’s scared to be alone or to have to start all over with someone. What can I do? My heart hurts and I’m confused if this person is just using me. I also can’t understand what my feelings are anymore and I’m frustrated with myself. Any advice is much appreciated <3

Amelia had her hands full, managing 70 kids, ten adults, two buses, and the financial side of the trip. It was exhausting, but she thrived in the chaos.

During a rare quiet moment, her principal, Nathan, approached her with a steaming cup of coffee. ""You need this,"" he said with a knowing smile. She took it gratefully, savoring the warmth in her hands.

""Thanks, I really do,"" Amelia replied, taking a careful sip. He nodded and gestured upstairs. ""I'll be up there if you need anything. Just checking in.""

As he walked away, Amelia felt a presence nearby. Turning her head, she spotted Ethan, one of the ski resort workers, watching her with an amused smirk. ""You really have everything under control, huh?"" he remarked.

She chuckled, shaking her head. ""Trying my best.""

""Saw you running around earlier. Impressive. Thought I'd come say hi, but you were too busy bossing everyone around.""

""That’s the job,"" she replied smoothly, a playful glint in her eye.

Before she could say more, another staff member called for her attention, and just like that, she was swept away again.

Later in the afternoon, Amelia made her way to the coffee stand, in desperate need of a second cup. As she stood in line, she glanced up and caught sight of Ethan behind the counter, giving her an easy grin.

""Back for round two?"" he teased.

She raised an eyebrow, feigning surprise. ""And you work here too? What, do you run this whole place?""

""Only the important parts,"" he said, handing her the coffee before she could even place her order. ""Figured you'd need another.""

She accepted it, a little taken aback but amused. ""Are you trying to get on my good side?""

He leaned on the counter, smirking. ""Is it working?""

Amelia laughed, shaking her head before turning away. ""We'll see.""

As she walked off, she couldn't help but glance back over her shoulder. Ethan was still watching her, a knowing look on his face before he turned to help another customer. She felt the warmth of the coffee in her hands, but for the first time that day, she realized it wasn’t the only thing making her feel warm.

As the day wound down, Amelia found herself back in the lodge, checking over logistics for the departure. The students were gathered, recounting their adventures on the slopes, while teachers exchanged exhausted glances. She was reviewing the final checklist when a familiar voice interrupted her thoughts.

""So, did I make it onto your good side yet?"" Ethan asked, appearing beside her.

She smirked, crossing her arms. ""You're persistent, I'll give you that.""

He shrugged. ""I figure someone who handles chaos as well as you deserves at least a little extra coffee and conversation.""

Amelia tilted her head, considering him. ""You're not wrong about the coffee. But conversation? I barely have time to think.""

""Lucky for you, I’m patient,"" he said, his smirk softening into something more genuine. ""Besides, I’ll be here next time your school comes around.""

She chuckled, shaking her head. ""We’ll see about that.""

Ethan gave her one last smile before heading back to his post. As she turned back to her checklist, she couldn’t help but think—maybe the next ski trip wouldn’t just be about managing chaos. Maybe, just maybe, it would come with a little fun too.

Months passed, and Amelia got caught up in work, the ski trip becoming a distant memory. One day, she stumbled upon a crumpled napkin in her coat pocket—Ethan's number scribbled on it. Her stomach twisted. She had meant to text him back. She had planned to. But life had gotten in the way.

Feeling a pang of guilt, she decided to look him up, just to see if he was still around. But as she searched, her breath caught.

Ethan had passed away in an accident on the slopes that same year. An avalanche had hit an experienced group of resort staff on a remote run, leaving no survivors.

She sat there, staring at the screen, the world suddenly feeling a little heavier. The warmth of those coffees, his easy grin—it was all frozen in time now, a memory of a moment she hadn't realized would be their last.

We went with Durango tile. [https://www.centura.ca/en/products/tile/ceramic-tiles/durango](https://www.centura.ca/en/products/tile/ceramic-tiles/durango)

We have a fairly big dog (and will continue to have dogs) so we're worried about his joints as he gets older. Our designer recommended tile over hardwood or vinyl flooring because there's more options for finishes. 

At the showroom we told them we wanted to go with something more textured (less glossy, less slippery) and why. They recommended a bunch in and around our budget.

There many options we liked the look of, so no compromises there. 

The dog use to slide on the hardwood and had to be careful how he sat. He's not doing that anymore. 

Once installed we immediately noticed it is so much easier for everyone to walk on.  While we were originally thinking about the dog, this tile is better for everyone -- small kids, older adults, anyone with mobility issues, morning pre-coffee people in sock feet.

1izwj4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1izwj4o/small_hybrid_awd_suv/,Small hybrid AWD SUV,"I find myself in need of a new vehicle urgently. I have determined the requirements as

\- new

\- small

\- SUV

\- hybrid

\- AWD

\- (high want) HUD

  
Now, if HUD is available at all, it is usually only in the top level trim, and at those prices I might just as well look at luxury brands, but do they even have hybrids?

Ok, I tried to start with the TL;DR. This bit is the long-winded context for the curious.

I am single (widow, hence small vehicle) and live in Seattle area (hence AWD for the snow we get every few years that the city doesn’t have the infrastructure to clear). I am progressively disabled, getting around on a small foldable motor scooter (Luggie), which I currently deadlift (60 lbs) into the backseat of my car (protected by a treadmill mat). However, it is now patently clear I can no longer manage this, which means my mobility is cut off.

There are lifts/hoists, though, that can mount in the cargo space of an SUV to help. They need the height and extra room from the gate of an SUV or minivan. The remaining two requirements, new and hybrid are my personal strong preferences. 

 I currently  drive a 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring, with 14,2xx miles on the clock. I bought it new, and waited an extra three weeks to get it in the Kona Coffee I wanted. I love all the electronic bells and whistles, but in particular the HUD, which I would have thought in 7 years would have become standard. 

I am prepared to look at the lower end of the luxury ranges as well; I do like esthetics, but my primary concerns are quality and reliability. Anyone have any bright ideas? The internet tells me my best option is a CR-V.

Thanks in advance for your patience and advice.",1,1740707287.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,0,1.0,False

We have been together for roughly 8 months. 3 months ago her sister with undiagnosed schizophrenia moved in with her. Even up to about 2-3 weeks ago, her and I would talk and text all the time, be on facetime whenever her and I werent at work (we work together, how we met). She is the first girl I ever fell in love with, and I’ve fallen hard. 

A few weeks ago I started to see her pull away. She hasnt sent me a text message in 10 days, and our messages were all me up until 2 days ago when I stopped texting her, letting her reach out. The last time she texted me was a ‘goodmorning babe’ text saying she got a coffee for me waiting at work. She has called me every day but every call has been brief, and not what it used to be. 7 Days ago we talked in the car and I asked her what was happening and why she doesnt talk to me much anymore. She says she is stressed and depressed and doesnt want her sister to see that she is talking to me (her sister is crazy and has been trying to control her life). The thing is, I see her texting other people. All. The. Time. I’ve asked her if she still wants to do this, and she says she doesnt know if she’ll be back to how she was anytime soon. Meanwhile, she seemed so in love just a few weeks ago. She would talk about starting a life together, moving in, etc. She says ‘I love you’ every end of our conversations on the phone but I can tell the way she acts towards me has done a complete 180. She is the first girl I’ve fell in love with and the only girl I’ve been able to see myself spending my life with. I am so anxious and confused. 

AIO? Is this really just because of her sister, or do you all believe its done? Should I continue to let her be the one to reach out?

I met a guy (22M) who seemed perfect - fun, outgoing, easygoing, and a good listener. We lived in the same apartment, so we'd often hang out, grab coffee, or go for walks. We clicked due to our many similarities, and I found myself opening up to him about my life, family, and everything else.

At first, I thought I was comfortable with him because we were friends, but later I realized it was more than that. He made me feel secure, always looking out for me - carrying my bag, fanning me when it was hot, and walking beside me. He does the bare minimum things naturally. Yes BARE MINIMUM. 💀 We kept everything that we do private, even from our friends. 

What drew me to him was how naturally he did things I wished someone could do for myself. Our nightly conversations were meaningful; he understood me deeply, even the parts I kept hidden. It was as if I was an open book to him.

We agreed to keep things casual, doing partner-like things without commitment. But when he left, I couldn't forget him. We're no longer in touch, and he's with someone right now. I'm left silently rooting for him.

Although I got hurt, I don't regret my decision to be with him. I knew what I was getting into, and I chose to take that risk. So i kept asking myself until now, why did i settle for casual when i knew myself i’m a lover girl that easily gets attach? Why did i settle for casual?

It kinda worries me, like when did she think WW1 and WW2 happened? Or MLK jr? 

But it all did kinda click in my head about why she believes insane conspiracies & also keeps insisting on talking about the “coffee with ur younger self” thing w Brooke & Trisha. They both didn’t rlly want to get into it (which I understand esp on a video that millions of ppl will see) & tana just rambled with the most basic takes. Like everyone would tell their young selves to not beat themselves up & that things will work out. 

I feel like tana is trying to sound smart & lecture but it came off kinda fake deep. maybe that’s harsh but the regurgitated tiktok therapy talk is annoying. & I felt for Brooke too, I dislike her but I think she really thought ab the “prompt” instead of feeling the need to lecture & project surface level advice like tana did. 

I feel like tana needs to get an education & get some hobbies. I think her fixation on her looks & push for therapy talk is boredom & also her lack of understanding of the world. Like she’s trying to find an answer & mask her insecurities without putting in the work. 

For ex: she just kept calling ash Trevino a narcissist over & over again. (Which ofc she’s a terrible person) but it felt like tana only rlly knew about the bed (didn’t do research) & kept projecting her own childhood onto ash’s daughters. ",19,1740706970.0,canceledpod,5,1.0,False

I can't fully yet bc I can't start OCIA until I'm out of my moms house next fall. Anyway, I don't know how to deal with protestant friends or acquaintances trying to evangelize me. I was once like them, trying to evangelize to my catholic friends, so I understand the intent. But I'm really tired of people saying or implying that I left Christianity, was never Christian to begin with, and am unintelligent bc how could I possibly be catholic?? 

1. I had coffee with a friend and she was telling me how her sister liked a catholic boy and how she listened to him pray a rosary. she said her sister told this boy he could pray directly to God and the boy was apparently taken aback. I know this boy is very devout so I knew what she said was a lie. So I politely told her that was not true, catholics do pray directly to God. Then she continued saying they also believe in works based salvation.  I again told her thats not true and we believe in faith and obedience. She kept yapping and I kept correcting her until she said ""Okay then, what do you think they believe? Because (sister) has done tons of research on this and thats actually what they believe."" So I told her to find her claim in the catechism. she said she didn't know what that was and continued, ""Do you know how catholicism was started? It started as a sex cult by a man who wanted to sleep with everyone and claimed God told him to."" I gave up on the conversation because I didn't want to fight, but she was very condescending. 

2. The pastor of the church I grew up in came up to me after church (I still have to go to my protestant church after mass to keep my mom happy). The sermon that day was about sola fide and he looked at me very smugly and said, ""what did you think about the sermon?"" and I just said ""it was good,"" to limit confrontation. and he replied with, ""yeah? good truth right?"" and smiled in the most condescending way. I just said ""it was good"" and he said ""good truth, right?"" I wish I could explain the look on his face, but it was very derogatory and belittling. 

3. I'm currently going to a Baptist bible study for college kids with a friend. The woman who hosts it found out I was converting and texted me privately instead of the normal group chat. She asked why and I told her and she told me to talk to her son who went to bible college bc he knows more and that I just need to follow God and the bible and she'll pray for me. She was very kind, but it was implied I was following neither God nor the bible. 

I feel like I constantly have to defend myself and I'm tired of everyone being so condescending. It's getting harder and harder to not get angry. I would never show my anger but am I wrong for feeling it? It's only been about 3 months since people found out and things like this keep happening. How do I deal with this? Is it wrong to say I don't want to talk about it if talking about it may help them come to the truth? How do I not get angry? sorry for the long post. ",6,1740706873.0,Catholicism,5,1.0,False

I (23 M, AuDHD) have been dating my boyfriend (21 M, bipolar) for two years, living together for one, and I’m starting to think I might just be too autistic to realize this relationship isn’t working.

Before we moved in, things were fine, but now I feel like I’m more of a caretaker than a partner. He lost his parents young, lived alone through high school, and never developed basic hygiene, organization, or cleaning habits. I didn’t realize how much that would affect me until we shared a space. I’ve had to hire in-house help at a thousand ish monthly to handle things he should integrate into his day to day life, like laundry, dishes, cleaning, etc, because I can’t be a full time maid myself. On top of the stress of his untrained large inside dog and two untrained cats. 

We also have completely different worlds—he runs a theatre company and a dance studio, I do data science and run a tech company. We both make a ton of money, but our mindsets are totally different. He’s very leftist, constantly talking about “gay culture,” which I just don’t connect with. I see being gay as a trait, like preferring tea over coffee, not an entire cultural identity. He gives radical socialist on a good day, whereas I’m more pragmatic and libertarian, so a lot of his ideological takes just don’t compute for me.

On top of that, we haven’t been intimate in months. We work early and late into the night, and it just never comes up. I loved living alone, having my own space, my own schedule, and not feeling responsible for someone else’s life. But I suck at confrontation, so I just let things slide. Every month or so, he says something like, “You don’t want to be in this relationship,” expecting me to fight for it. But I don’t. And then somehow, we just go back to normal.

I don’t even know if I want a relationship at all, but I don’t know how to end this in a way that isn’t an emotional trainwreck. I care about him as a person and want him to succeed, but I feel like I’m physically complacent in something that’s already over.

Is this just me not understanding social cues? Have I already broken up with him emotionally, and I’m just too autistic to realize it? How do I make a clean exit when I struggle with confrontation and emotional processing, also considering he owns the house? ",1,1740706600.0,autism,1,1.0,False
1izwaf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1izwaf9/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_delonghi/,Explore the best espresso machine De'Longhi ECP3420 review: Is it worth it?,"As someone who enjoys a good cup of coffee every morning, I was excited to try out the De'Longhi ECP3420 Espresso Machine. After weeks of testing it daily, I can confidently share my experience with this compact yet powerful coffee maker. While it delivers impressive results, there are aspects you might want to consider before adding it to your kitchen.

**Brewing Performance**

The 15-bar professional pressure is the star feature of the De'Longhi ECP3420, ensuring a rich and consistent espresso shot every single time. I appreciated how easy it was to switch between brewing a single or double espresso, thanks to the three-in-one filter holder. The machine is quite efficient, with minimal warm-up time, so I could enjoy my coffee quickly, even on busy mornings. However, timing the shot manually could be a bit tricky at first, especially if you're used to fully automated machines.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The manual frother performs admirably, producing creamy, velvety milk foam for cappuccinos and lattes. I experimented with different types of milk, including almond and oat, and the results were satisfactory across the board. Although it’s not professional-grade, it’s more than enough for home use. My kids loved their frothy hot chocolates, and I enjoyed trying my hand at latte art—though the frother might not be ideal for intricate designs.

[Check De'Longhi ECP3420 Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00ycp71vk/)

**Design & Build Quality**

This espresso machine boasts a sleek, compact design with stainless steel accents that blend seamlessly into any kitchen decor. It’s lightweight yet sturdy, making it easy to move around if needed. The narrow footprint is perfect for small countertops, though the plastic components may feel less premium compared to pricier models. I noticed the drip tray could feel a bit flimsy, but it’s functional and easy to clean.

**Coffee Quality**

The De'Longhi ECP3420 consistently delivers rich, flavorful espresso with a thick crema on top. I tried various coffee blends and grind sizes, and the machine handled them well. For the best results, I found that using freshly ground beans and lightly tamping the coffee provided the perfect balance of flavor and extraction.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water tank is removable, making refilling and cleaning a breeze. Its transparent design allows for easy monitoring of water levels, which I found particularly handy. However, the tank's capacity might feel a bit limiting if you're making multiple drinks in one session, especially when entertaining guests.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

One of the standout features is how easy it is to maintain this espresso machine. The removable water tank, drip tray, and filter holder are all dishwasher-safe, which saves time. I also appreciated the straightforward descaling process, though regular maintenance is essential to keep the machine running smoothly. A minor gripe is that the drip tray tends to fill up quickly, so frequent emptying is necessary.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

This machine is relatively energy-efficient, with a simple switch to turn it on and off. However, it does lack an auto-shutoff feature, which means you’ll need to remember to power it down after use. In terms of noise, it falls somewhere in the middle—not whisper-quiet but not excessively loud either. The brewing and frothing processes may wake up light sleepers, so keep that in mind if you’re an early riser.

**Warranty & Support**

De'Longhi offers a one-year limited warranty for the ECP3420. While I didn’t encounter any major issues, it’s reassuring to know that customer support is available. The user manual is clear and detailed, and there are plenty of online videos and resources to help you get the most out of the machine.

**Advantages**

* Compact design fits small spaces beautifully.
* Produces rich espresso with consistent crema.
* Versatile frother for cappuccinos and lattes.
* Easy-to-clean removable components.
* Transparent water tank for hassle-free refilling.

**Limitations**

* Manual operation requires some practice.
* Plastic components may feel less durable.
* Lacks an automatic shutoff feature.
* Drip tray fills up quickly and needs frequent emptying.

**Competitive Options**

When comparing the De'Longhi ECP3420 to competitors like the Breville Bambino Plus and the Gaggia Classic Pro, a few distinctions stand out. The Bambino Plus offers faster heat-up times and automatic milk frothing but comes at a higher price point. Meanwhile, the Gaggia Classic Pro provides a more traditional espresso-making experience with a higher build quality, though it’s bulkier and less beginner-friendly. The ECP3420 strikes a balance between price, functionality, and ease of use, making it a great option for casual coffee drinkers.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

In terms of overall value for money, the De'Longhi ECP3420 delivers a solid performance at a competitive price. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of premium machines, it offers everything a beginner or casual espresso enthusiast might need. If you’re on a budget but still want to enjoy barista-style coffee at home, this machine is definitely worth considering.

1izw9jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1izw9jt/symptoms_insight/,Symptoms Insight,"Hi there- thank you for reading what I suspect with be a long winded post.  I have struggled with pain under my xiphoid process since 2009. The first time I remember it occurring was after eating Mexican. It was sudden and severe and only had some relief after being able to have a BM a few hours later. It had been recurring ever since, but has been more noticeable/painful since I had a hysterectomy in June 2024. I want to preface that and say that I think the problem was always there but was just masked by the pain that was caused by reasoning behind my hysterectomy (uterine fibroids, endometriosis and constant bleeding). I am just ready to feel better overall and am feeling at a loss. 

My 💩 related symptoms: constipation, hard time passing BM, will only go 2-3x per week, when I do go the poop is either so hard and big I have to assist it in coming out and it clogs the toilet or it is slimey, have had green poop periodically, blood in stool rarely, mucus in stool regularly.

Some other symptoms I struggle with include: super sensitive gag reflux (new within the last year or so), heart burn/acid reflux at times, fatigue.

I also experience what I described to my doctor as ‘Charlie horses of the butthole’. Essentially that was tied to endometriosis lesions that were connecting to my bowels and has minimized.

I first went to my doctor to talk about this all in September 2024 and my PCP prescribed me omeprazole and something else. I stopped taking them because I didn’t have any real relief. He had me get an xray of xiphoid process- no concerns. He had me do a hydrogen breath test and h pylori- both showed no concerns. I have another appointment tomorrow with my PCP and I think I am going to ask for a referral to a GI doctor.

Some other things to note:
- 35 year old female
- have had same issues at various weights
- mom has a ulcerative colitis dx
- hysterectomy was due to endometriosis that had recurring lesions to the bowels, uterine fibroids, heavy bleeding did 70+ days at a time.
- have had endometriosis removal surgeries a couple of times before the hysterectomy 
- right now all foods seem to bother me. Dairy products, coffee and cookies are more consistency items I can remember causing problems 

What should my next steps be to try to find a remedy?

Thank you!

1izw833,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowjackets/comments/1izw833/theory_walters_season_3_appearances_are_all/,Theory: Walter's Season 3 Appearances Are All Hallucinations (Spoilers through episode 3),"I've been kicking the idea around and decided to make a post about it.  I believe all of Misty's interactions with Walter in season three have been Misty hallucinating. I believe Walter, as a character, is real in the show, but that Walter himself has not really been physically present since the end of season two.  What we have seen in season three is Misty imagining Walter as a result of her grief and guilt over killing Natalie.  It is a way for her to process her own thoughts about her friendships with the surving Yellowjackets.  The hallucination serves as someone to talk things out with when the people she thinks of as friends don't offer comfort.

Evidence:

Every time we see Walter in season three, Misty is the only other person present.  She is the only one Walter speaks with or touches.  Importantly, whenever we see Walter, Misty's mental state is altered - either by deep grief, or by alcohol (or allergy medication mixed with alcohol. Fuck you Callie, you could kill someone with that shit!).

The big clue is the bar scene in episode one.  We see Misty get very drunk, very fast, at the bar.  Then Misty sees and hears young Natalie talking to her from the mirror.  As an audience, we now know that Misty is capable of hallucinating things that are not really there. It also shows that Natalie is at the forefront of Misty's thoughts (as if wearing Nat's jacket wasn't enough).

Walter in episode 1:

We see Walter twice in this episode.  The first time is the morning of Nat's funeral. Her guilt about killing Natalie would likely feel very close to the surface on that day. Misty is trying to meditate to gain some mental peace.  Walter interrupts her loudly (like an intrusive thought when meditating).   Walter reminds her that Nat's funeral is that day.  He leaves Misty the key to Natalie's storage unit.  

The only two people in the scene are Misty and Walter, so we have no indication that he was really there.  What about the key? Misty could have easily snooped around and obtained the key to Nat's storage unit prior to Nat's death, and left the key on her bedside.  The hallucination of Walter giving the key to Misty could just be Misty's mind reminding her about it because she is looking for a distraction and a reason not to go to the funeral.

The second time we see Walter is after the bar scene.  When he drives up next to a very drunk Misty, he says Misty left her phone at the bar.  Misty briefly pats her pockets and can't find her phone.  Walter says the bartender called all Misty's friends, and Walter was the only one who answered.  Walter gets out of the car and hugs Misty to comfort her.

But did that really happen? We don't see the bartender make the call. We don't see Walter answer the call. After he finds her, we don't see Walter give a phone back to Misty (which would confirm he had been to the bar and got her phone from the bartender). We don't know that her phone was ever actually missing - Misty was so drunk she could easily have forgotten what pocket her phone was in.

What we see is Misty walking down a completely empty street, then Walter pulls up beside Misty in a car, talks to her, and hugs her. Misty could have hallucinated the entire interaction.  And this is the scene when Walter starts to question the sincerity of the Yellowjackets' friendship with Misty.

Walter in episode 2:

Again, we see Walter twice.  The first time is when he wakes Misty in the morning with breakfast.  Again, they are the only two in the scene.   Misty is clearly hung over.  She does NOT eat the food that Walter made her (a potential indicator the food wasn't real). Walter suggests that Misty's actions the night before were ""a cry for help.""  Misty tells Walter that he could never understand the true friendship Misty had with the other Yellowjackets, as it was forged in life or death sitiations.  

During their conversation, Walter refers to the call made to Shauna the night before as the call MISTY made (""your call""), not the call the bartender made. The call was likely made from Misty's phone, so maybe Walter's verbal slip can be excused (thoughe he seems the type to be very precise with his words). Or, it could be Misty acknowledging to herself (via hallucination), that SHE called Shauna for help, and her so-called-friend did not bother to answer. I believe Misty is starting to wonder, (given how none of them reached out after Nat's death) whether the other survivors really care about Misty or theor friendships.  And ""Walter"" represents the doubt that is growing. 

The second time we see Walter, it is after Misty comes home from babysitting.  Walter and the parrot are the only ones in the house when Misty arrives.  Misty is both drunk and drugged (though Misty doesn't know about the drugs).  Walter is angry that Misty had to drive herself home, and tells Misty that good friends would not have let Misty drive when she was drunk.  Misty tells Walter she doesn't want to listen to this from him anymore, and that he should just leave if he won't love Misty's friends in addition to Misty.

Again, there are no other witnesses to the conversation.  This could be another instance of Walter as Misty's hallucination, being a stand-in for Misty's growing belief that her friends don't care for her at all.

Walter in episode 3:

Interestingly, Walter is not in episode three.  He apparently left Misty's home after she told him to go.  Another interesting point is that we only see Misty alone once in this episode, when she returns to burn the reunion picture.  

If Walter is a hallucination brought on by grief and alcohol/drugs, there are two reasons for him not to be in this scene.  The first is that, in this moment, Misty is not grieving. Misty is ANGRY.  In this moment, Misty has no need to talk anything out with Walter because she no longer has doubts about her relationships. Misty has decided her friends were not really true friends and she is furious about it. 

The second reason hallucination-Walter is absent is that Misty is stone-cold sober.  As far as we know, she has had coffee and a scone today, and nothing since the car incident with Shauna.

Why is this important?

So we've got two Walter possibilities happening this season.  The first is that Walter is really there and Misty is just having a terrible time with her boyfriend.  It is a shitty stessor that adds to the emotional journey she's going on regarding her relationships with the other survivors (Shauna in particular).

The other possibility, that Walter is a hallucination, is far more interesting.
I think Misty is suicidal due to her grief and guilt about Nat's death. Misty is drinking like crazy, and knowingly driving home while drunk. Misty was HOPEFUL that her friends were having an intervention for her when she went to Shauna's.  I think Misty IS somehow responsible for the breaks not working Shauna's van, even though Misty would also be riding inside it. I think Misty was subconsiously ready to die in a car wreck. I think Misty was subconsiously willing to take Shauna out with her, because of Misty's increasing doubts about the sincerity of their friendship.  Hell, cutting the breaks could have been Misty's  twisted idea for a friendship test!  Misty wanted to see how Shauna would react and if Shauna would care whether Misty was safe and uharmed.  Walter as a hallucination is an indicator of Misty's troubled state of mind.  He is the ""cry for help,"" that Walter himself noted.  

I'll be watching to see whether Walter reappears, either with Misty alone or with anyone else.  ",5,1740706325.0,Yellowjackets,9,0.63,False
1izw7xq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1izw7xq,"Real Korea in G-Valley in Geumcheon, Korea's Silicon Valley","Located in Geumcheon and Guro districts, G Valley is the largest in the nation as an apartment-type factory called Knowledge Industry Center. Recently, various colors have been added to G Valley, which used to be a gray area. New Knowledge Industry Center equipped with cultural facilities such as exhibition halls and large cafes that showcase the aesthetics of space by utilizing old factories have been built. This place is recommended to foreigners as a place where they can take a close look at the working life of Koreans. 

It is estimated that about 140,000 office workers work in G Valley. IT manufacturing and software development companies are mainly gathered. 

In recent years, new spaces have been added to the G-Valley. The public addition has a space where visitors can hold various cultural events along with an office. The exhibition ""Jean Julien's Paper World,"" which runs through next month, has gone viral in the G-Valley, which was considered a cultural barren land.

It is the last series of ""Paper People,"" in which French illustrator Jean Julien showed his original world view at Ginza Six in Tokyo and Le Bon Marché department stores in Paris. It also hosted ""Happy Hour,"" which allows office workers to receive tickets and coffee exchange tickets during lunch for only 10,000 won.

Public Gasan created a shelter in the city center by greening 42 percent of the land area in the G Valley, which lacks green space. Starbucks is also targeting the central garden and waterfront space, not the main street. Located on the side of Public Gasan, the library specializing in design is a place where start-ups and SMEs can contemplate on ways to innovate their designs.

In spring, Anyangcheon Stream, which is full of cherry blossoms, is a seasonal event in the G Valley. In the case of G Valley Complex 2 and 3, which is long between Anyangcheon Stream and Line 1, it is connected to Anyangcheon Stream in just a few blocks of walking. 

Located in the residential area of Gasan Digital Complex Station on Subway Line 1, the Guro Industrial Complex Workers' Life Experience Center ""Geumcheon Sooni's House"" remembers Korea in the past. The red-brick two-story detached house vividly recreates the dossier of female workers who worked at the Guro Industrial Complex, which was mainly focused on low-wage light industry such as wigs and sewing factories in the 1960s and 1980s. In a room of only 2-3 pyeong, three or four people gathered to sleep cramped, and materials containing the socio-economic lifestyle of the time, including night schools where young people who came to Seoul in the country continued their studies, are also on display.

Every fall, the ""Geumcheon Fashion Film Festival"" continues the past, present, and future of G Valley under the theme of fashion. The festival has been held for four years based on the history of the clothing manufacturing industry and the infrastructure of downtown outlets. It is the first and only fashion film festival in Korea.

The opening ceremony of last year's festival was held at the Mario Cartoon Factory, a low-rise building built in 1969.


There were also fashion runways for young people by era and ""AI conferences"" to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) film production. The third award-winning short film ""Echo"" was officially invited to the ""La Cineph"" section of the Cannes Film Festival.",1,1740706311.0,KoreaSeoul,0,1.0,False
1izw77a,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1izw77a/caffeine_made_me_lose_my_job/,Caffeine made me lose my job.,"To start this off, I always used to get these horrible anxiety attacks. My family has a history of anxiety, so it was no surprise when I inherited this awful disorder. I found out that coffee contributes to my anxiety, so I tend to stay away from caffeine. Once in a while I will order a decaffeinated coffee when I need something hot on these cold mornings. I know there is a small trace of caffeine, but there’s not enough to cause any issues.

Last year, my dad (who also frequents this specific location) upset one of the workers. This employee just so happened to date a fellow coworker of mine. He had informed me that she doesn’t like my dad and will periodically give him caffeinated coffee instead of his usual decaf coffee to get back at him. When I heard about this, I made an anonymous tip to a manager who assured me she would look into it. My dad didn’t want to make a big deal about it, but I didn’t think it was right, 

Last month I stopped by in the morning with my dad for a decaf coffee and noticed when I got it that it tasted a bit off. I chalked it up as being burnt, or maybe that they didn’t put enough cream in it. I really didn’t think about the fact that maybe this employee is now messing with me as well. I had no negative interactions with this employee. I felt like It could’ve been an honest mistake. 

This potential mistake led to me being whisked away on a stretcher and taken to the ER. My heart rate was intense, I had a fever and I felt like absolute trash. After that whole situation, I stayed away from coffee for a bit. It was quite a difficult experience, but I did it for my health. After a while I finally started to feel like myself again.

One day after work I stopped by for a decaf coffee as I missed the taste. I ordered it, and confirmed twice with the employee that it was correct due to my previous issue. She ensured me that it was correct. I drank it and I had no issues. That went on for a few more days before I was comfortable enough to try drinking coffee before work again. 

That morning I went to this location, ordered my coffee and made my way to work. I got about halfway through my coffee when suddenly I started to feel my heart start to race again. I felt very faint and Ill. I had to sit down for a minute and try and compose myself. My nerves were shot, so I couldn’t really walk all that well. I told my supervisor about the situation and he seemed to be really concerned.
ed
He let me know that they were concerned for me, but they couldn’t keep me if this g is something that would affect my job performance. It was absolutely embarrassing. I couldn’t believe I lost my job over a medical issue. But I understood how it may be a liability to have someone faint while working directly with glass. I wasn’t mad at my employer, surprisingly. I was more upset that a simple cup of coffee caused this whole mess. 

My question is, should I consider legal action? Do I have a case here?

Hi ok please listen and just give me your honest advice. I can’t talk to my family about this really.

I am 21 (I’ll be 22 in a few short months). I graduated college just last month with honors. I am clean, I can drive, I speak 3 different languages, i am literally the perfect daughter. I am currently looking for a job and I just wanna get a good job and move out asap.

I am an only daughter to an ethnic/immigrant family. They are very overbearing and overprotective. They are very prideful of their culture and their image. About a year ago around this time they made me break up with my boyfriend of 4 years…

REASON WHY:

I love him and I still do. They didn’t like him simply because he was half of a different ethnicity than us. They tried to break us up for years due to this. Well finally, last year around this time they snuck into my laptop without my permission and read out private messages (you know the kind). Those messages were consensual and we were in love and safe. But my parents were shocked and they even showed my grandmother the messages (they are also very religious). They all got together and cornered me and threatened me to break up with him… it ended up with me having a mental breakdown in the hospital. I am so depressed. They even threatened to divorce and that their own marriage would fail because of me if I didn’t. They pretended like he never even existed and that they are normal now like they “won”. They made me so scared I just let them act like everything is ok even though I’m so resentful and hurt and depressed. They used those messages to get what they wanted and even threatened to tell the other family. They said that it was all his fault (my boyfriend) but I consented to it too. It’s not like we were underage or something. The messages were explicit and had us pretending and stuff but it was just supposed to be for us… 

A year later and I’m still so depressed. Now I’m trying to get a job and just get out. I’m trying so hard to get a job but it’s hard. I keep working hard and praying. But I want to tell my parents and I want to be honest with them. I want to tell him I want to get back with him… I love him. If I lose him because of them I will be devastated. They may try to guilt trip me more though or more idk. 

I did everything my parents wanted and I was the perfect daughter they could show around. How the heck am I so bad now because I love a man who is only half of a different ethnicity than us?? I want to be happy too and live unapologetically. 

I still also love my family deep down though and this hurts me. I feel so much.

Someone please give me advice.


ALSO now he wants to meet for a final time on Saturday. For a quick coffee and to basically say goodbye for now (deciding to break up but remain in contact until i hopefully find a job soon) idk im freaking out",2,1740706185.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Unfortunately, they are all dead and I can’t find the paper recipe card my grandmother wrote out decades ago and even if I could, it was so worn the last time I saw it I could barely read it. Please bare with me while I explain what I do remember:

We would boil water, cocoa powder, and sugar to create a syrup. That would be set aside to cool. Then we beat together eggs, Crisco, (I think butter but that’s also in the frosting recipe that I do have so maybe not but I think so), vanilla, and I’m pretty sure more sugar. Then we would mix up dry ingredients (flour, salt??, and baking powder or soda). Then we would incorporate the chocolate mixture by 1/3, the Crisco mixture by 1/3, on and on until we had the batter. Finally we would add 1 cup of freshly brewed coffee. 

My sisters birthday was a few days ago and I would really love to surprise her with the cake that we’ve both missed for so long. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? This recipe is super old, my great great grandmother claimed it was passed to her so we’re talking over a century if that’s true. There has to be something similar out there somewhere. ",2,1740706058.0,Baking,3,1.0,False

I don't know when to stop filling up the small glass with espresso, so I just fill it all the way to the brim until it automatically stops. And I also watched the tutorial on here on how to do a steamed milk but it's still isn't working. All of the customers are just really mad all the time. But I love all of the new characters and the music! And the StoryLine also is cool too but I just don't like how it is so hard to make a simple espresso.

1izw4i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JerseyCityNJ/comments/1izw4i9/building_community_through_coffee_and_creativity/,Building Community Through Coffee and Creativity,"Hello Reddit,

Finding like-minded individuals to collaborate on community events can be challenging. As a home baker with high-level barista skills, I’ve built my business on an appointment basis, offering barista classes in both Spanish and English. While this has been rewarding, I’m eager to do more with the space I have available.

I’ve hosted events like a dessert night but struggled with attendance, likely due to my limited marketing budget. I want to improve my outreach and collaborate with others who have event ideas but lack a venue. The space I use in Jersey City features an espresso machine and comfortably accommodates up to 25 people perfect for intimate gatherings.

I typically cater events with homemade cookies and quick bread loaves, baked with love and passion. My vision is to host community events such as game nights, poetry slams, and live painting sessions. However, I’m not yet connected to these creative communities and need help bridging that gap.

If you’re an artist, poet, or community organizer looking for a space to share your craft, let’s collaborate! Together, we can build a community that celebrates creativity, connection, and, of course, great coffee.

Did I mention I live in Brooklyn and commute to make things happen? When I want something I go for it and that is the kind of people I want to surround myself with.

Much thanks,

A Brooklyn Barista with a Dream",1,1740706012.0,JerseyCityNJ,0,1.0,False

Beginnings of a **FAQ** about meetups:

* [rules for publicizing a meetup on reddit platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/wiki/index/calendar/disclaimer)
* [what happens at these meetups?](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/a3um4s/weekend_meetup_thread/ebab1pj/)
* [/u/solidified50 gave some general advice for starting a meetup and keeping it going.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/aa5khh/weekend_meetup_thread/ed4cu3m/)
* Meetups should be (mostly) free. Ordering coffee, similar minimum items from a menu excepted, but events that charge formal admission or an entry fee cannot be publicized here.
* Some meetups use a sign to give attendees an easy way to see the group and know which to join without too much embarrassment, etc.",1,1740705706.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False
1izw0q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1izw0q3/i_feel_seen_im_not_even_mormon/,I feel seen & I’m not even mormon,"I did not grow up mormon and have never been a mormon, but my father was extremely conservative and super defensive of mormonism, despite him not believing in a god and hating church. My mother was a spineless enabler who just did whatever my father wanted.

I just wanna say that I have never found a place where people describe my childhood more than this subreddit. I stumbled across it & was shocked to see how many stories are exactly like mine. The obsession with purity and morality, the long-lasting insane punishments supposedly to reflect until I was “deserving,” the deep demonization of anything remotely sexual, the belief that people who did drugs or even drank coffee were hellish, the need to look like clean, deeply religious (for some reason?) and conservative people. 

I’ve never seen stories so similar even on other religious and narcissistic abuse forums/groups/sites/etc. I realize it is not the same as the actual corrupt mormon church, but my father was basically part of a hardcore conservative cult (usually full of mormons though tbh) and I was insanely brainwashed. I used to believe I was a horrible vile slut for wearing shorts for christ’s sake.

And you know who were the only kids in school who seemed to empathize, I now realize looking back? Mormons. I grew up in fucking conservative Texas and even then, they were the only people I ever met that resonated with my former batshit beliefs and standards. Not even other hardcore conservative and religious kids understood my family’s obsessions with morality.

I don’t know the point of writing this other than just, holy shit I feel so seen. I know I didn’t go through quite the same experience as yall did, I was not hurt by a church, but I relate extremely deeply to being hurt by members of a perfection-obsessed cult. It’s so cathartic in a fucked up way to finally see my EXACT memories written down by others. 

I just wanna say I love you all and I’m so sorry that you went through what you did.

1izvzb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1izvzb1/when_you_think_about_it_the_contradictions_in_so/,"When you think about it, the contradictions in so many aspects of this case are insane. The expected vs. the reality is almost absurd.","I always see comments about how insane this case is, but when you really lay some details out it’s just contradiction after contradiction.
I flaired this as humor, because it’s sort of funny, but I do actually want to discuss it and hear thoughts on it, and there are some things at the end I also felt like discussing. * Long post warning. *

&nbsp;


**The actual act itself and the alleged suspect:**


Expected: Suspect following their carefully planned out route.  
Reality: Suspect stops on the way at a Starbucks to buy a water bottle and granola bar. Not even Starbuck’s branded coffee, which would sort of make the stop make a little bit of sense.


Expected: Suspect covers up from head to toe to hide identity.  
Reality: Suspect leaves hands completely bare and touches several things.


Expected: Suspect carefully planned for months.   
Reality: Suspect leaves behind used water bottle, phone, and food wrappers, purportedly with fingerprints and possible DNA.


Expected: Suspect carefully, allegedly, wears a face mask everywhere in the week beforehand.  
Reality: Takes down his mask in full view of a hostel camera, then in a taxi scoots forward to directly stare into its security camera.


Expected: Experts go on air to say how they think the shooter is a trained assassin, someone who might have been hired to do the job.  
Reality: Suspect’s getaway vehicle is an e-bike.


Expected: Suspect isn’t found for five days. Everyone thinks they are clever and have successfully gotten away.  
Reality: Suspect is found, in similar clothing as what is seen from Dec 4, with a gun, and a notebook that apparently details everything out and a manifesto directly addressed to the feds, just to bring the trifecta of damning evidence all together.


Expected: “Higher ups” thought people would be condemning a murderer.  
Reality: Public is pretty much unequivocally on the shooter’s side, not just across the country, but even worldwide.

&nbsp;

**LM identified as suspect:** 


Expected: Police capture a suspect and release images of him hoping to embarrass him.  
Reality: Internet has a collective meltdown over his looks.


Expected: Suspect would fit the typical narrative of loner/weirdo/loser.  
Reality: Suspect is a peak academic, purported highly successful in life, and reportedly very well liked.


Expected: They try perp walking him to show everyone how dangerous he is in one of the biggest perp walks in US history.  
Reality: People lose their minds and think the images are incredible. He is compared to Superman being perp walked.


Expected: Four documentaries are released and the media mass reports try to smear LM’s character.  
Reality: Meanwhile internet sleuths get to work. The full extent of his: excellent academic background, how loved he is by everyone in his life, how socially successful he was, is revealed. His health problems make him sympathetic and relatable to the public. His supposed rejection of his privileged life makes him appear admirable. People even talk about how learning about him has fueled them to improve their own lives. 


Expected: The media sees the support and tries to change the narrative and labels LM supporters as “sick” “twisted” “insert disparaging name here”.  
Reality: Instead of embarrassing the supporters it fuels the fire and online groups, subreddits, communities, discords etc. are formed and still going strong months later. 


Expected: LM support is suppressed across all almost all social media outlets, in an attempt to suppress it. Even the words Free [his name] are labeled as violent/extremist content and cause posts to get removed/people banned from platforms.   
Reality: The censorship gets people angry and they post and comment more than they originally would have than if they had just been allowed to say what they wanted to say in the first place.


Expected: His first court appearance he is paraded around as slowly as possible to as many cameras as possible, chained up and surrounded by cops. Apparently to again to try to highlight how dangerous he is. Cameras are allowed in the courtroom which is unusual.   
Reality: Internet again collectively loses their minds, the sweater he is wearing sells out. His images go viral, and are compared to images from high fashion magazines.



Expected: Media goes quiet. Very little is reported on him. His next court appearance he has the shortest public walk to the courtroom available and cameras are denied inside of the room. Seems like it’s been realized by the powers that be that parading him around doesn’t work and has the opposite effect of making him look dangerous so they hope keeping him out of the limelight will help prevent support from growing.  
Reality: Even this backfires. After the over saturation of LM content by the media for every single public walk he has, people are not just expecting it, but wanting it. He still goes viral. The clothes he wears still sell out. 


Even now, the new info coming out: Altoona police were honored and awarded for his arrest before he has even had a trial. They really thought they had it in the bag.  
Reality: His lawyer has filed motions highlighting how much they have allegedly messed up the arrest.


Unexpected after unexpected. It’s like anything the higher-ups/law enforcement try to do to make LM be seen in a negative light to the people just automatically backfires and has the exact opposite effect to an almost frighteningly accurate degree. Their theory at this point should be, “if we think this will happen, we should expect the exact opposite to occur”.


I know there’s way more but this post is already so long. Feel free to share them in the comments.

&nbsp;

I also wanted to talk about “coincidences” that might actually not be so coincidental, but again, the length of the post. However, since these last two happened in the last week I feel they’re ok to include:


Hashbrown letter being shared. People spiraling about how it could not possibly be him and how he could not joke or even reference his arrest. However this brought A LOT of attention BACK to his McD’s arrest and then literally in the two days afterwards Dickey’s motions were filed and shared, which were questioning his arrest with the hash brown. All this after barely hearing anything about it for weeks.


Ron from Altoona’s video is found, where it was posted a few days (the 18th) BEFORE the Feb. 21 court day where Karen coincidentally shares with the public just how much evidence they don’t have and that they still don’t have a lot of the discovery. However it’s only discovered now, and as soon as it’s discovered it’s taken down. But as we all know once something is shared on the internet, it’s never going to be erased. Also to note the fourth documentary was released the day before it, on the 17th. How would the release of this video have swayed public opinion if it had successfully went viral before his last court date? Also who finds unreleased video footage from the biggest current criminal investigation in the country and decides their plan of action should be to personally narrate it and release it to the public? Who?!

1izvvk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1izvvk6/nutrition_advice_needed_intense_stomach_pain/,Nutrition advice needed - intense stomach pain,"Hello Reddit! I am currently training for my first marathon and needing some advice on proper nutrition and fueling, so I figured I’d give lots of details on my current training and eating and see if anyone would be able to help me with some of my issues.

I have been running for 4+ years now, but only really started doing long distance and increased load about 1.5 years ago (did my first half marathon race about a year ago). I’m currently training for my first full marathon and I’m currently at around 40 miles a week (5-6 runs; two speed, 2-3 easy, one long, max distance at this point 15mi). I have just now started incorporating gels and all of that is going fine so far in terms of my stomach during the run.

My main issue has been that I seem to just be hungry all the time, and in response to that I’ve increased my volume of what I eat. However even with that increase, I also have been having intense stomach pain/gas/bloating and now I can’t even tell what’s pain or bloating or what’s me being hungry. It’s not affecting my performance at all, but it makes a lot of my days just very uncomfortable and frustrating because I try to eat more than I usually have been but I still feel bad. This was never really an issue during my half marathon training.

I don’t count calories as I will say I had some issues with restricting in high school so I just prefer to not focus on numbers and focus more on if I feel hungry or not. I’m 22F, 5’1, around 120 lbs for context, but for example here is what I ate/did today:

5am - 6.2 mi tempo run. 
7am - 3 pieces of toast with jam, 2 scrambled eggs, coffee. was pretty full until lunch. 
12- two pieces of avocado toast (used whole avocado), 2 waffles
1-3pm- this is the point where i started experiencing intense stomach pain
3:30pm - light 30min walk, ate an apple and  drank electrolyte mix (20oz)
stomach felt even worse and bloated like crazy to the point of pain until i got home from work 
5:00 pm- brown sugar oatmeal packet
started to feel better but still uncomfortable
7:00pm - one piece of salmon, rice, and roasted broccoli 
also had 2x 64oz water throughout the day

i also take vitamin D and a multivitamin every morning. Also, I’m allergic to all nuts so I know that’s a popular snack but nuts and most protein bars are just not an option for me.

The stomach pain is just getting to a point where it seems like it happens with pretty much everything I eat, and it’s super distracting as it always happens post lunch and I feel terrible for the rest of the work day. Would anyone have any suggestions as to what to incorporate into my diet to potentially combat this issue? I don’t know if I should eat more variety of food, if I still need to increase my volume (although I feel like it’s already increased quite a bit from what it used to be), or what the deal is. Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated! (And apologies for how long this is!)",1,1740705248.0,Marathon_Training,0,1.0,False
1izvv7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1izvv7d/my_job_just_told_me_i_cannot_miss_anymore_daysat/,My job just told me I cannot miss anymore days.....at all. Medical field. Are they serious?,"I've been at my position for just about a year. I've been a great employee. In fact the last few weeks I've been picking up doubles just to help out. I've won awards and been given recognition, get along with everyone, the whole shebang.....I really love this job.

My attendance was spotty early on but I've worked very hard on it. I also caretake my terminally ill mother at home, something they've always been sensitive towards.

I'm a medical assistant caregiver at a dementia facility and also part time life enrichment.

I've had a great rapport with my head supervisor for awhile now. In fact I TRIED to quit in November and my supervisor went out of her way to meet me for coffee and ask me to please stay on board. I agreed.

I caught pneumonia last week. I'm still not 100% but I was well enough to come in after unfortunately missing 3 days. I had let my enrichment boss know last Thursday that I didn't feel well and she told me to come in just wear a mask. I did, pushed through Friday but realized my body was getting worse so ended up out of work Saturday and ER Sunday. Monday was my last day missed...came in today and all seemed great, normal good productive day until about an hour before my shift ended I was radioed into the conference room. In it was my head supervisor, my HR manager, my two nurse supervisors and my life enrichment boss.

They were all super upbeat and friendly when I came in but as we sat down to talk......well it went like this.

They said they wanted to understand the timeline of me getting sick so I went over it again. They asked about my hospital note which I went over. I admitted I wasn't in the best mindset Monday and apologized for any discrepancy in anything but yes that's how it all went. Then they asked about my mom, I told them the truth as usual (she really is nearing her time)....

Then they got to the point. They asked if I had properly called out as in way before shift and via call. I did not call - I texted. I honestly thought that was okay since they text me for all manners of things but I digress.

They said it was an improper call out and that this would be my last warning. None of them seemed happy or angry, in fact they all seemed very apologetic and kept thanking me for all I do. They expressed ""concern"" over my absences and yeah, bluntly told me if I have any more improper absences, they will ""unfortunately"" have to move ahead with termination.


I left the room almost in tears as they all quietly thanked me again. I'm on section 8. I ADORE my job. I STAYED HOME BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TO GET MY PATIENTS SICK AND KILL THEM.

I stopped in my head supervisors office afterwards to ask for clarity - was it how I called out? What was it exactly? She reiterated everything in the meeting and when I asked her ""well what if I genuinely get sick again"", she just went ""well, we have a policy on sick days"".
I could genuinely tell she wasn't happy or anything about the entire situation but I'm left scratching my damn head......I......can't ever get sick again basically? The time prior to this that I was out due to sickness my facility had a damn norovirus outbreak. EVERYONE got sick. 


Also. It was my final write up for attendance as they verbally said yet no paperwork was given unlike any other write up. My HR manager bounced back to normal afterwards, like they didn't just tell me they may terminate me in the future.


Is my career safe.....? Are they bluffing? I mean we are operating on a skeleton crew, like seriously it's just me and a handful of other employees. I take on doubles all the time and am even getting my QMAP so that I can be of BIGGER help to my job.


I just am in shock that my facility is asking me to come in no matter what, with people who are dying, so if I'm vomiting or coughing a lung up I'm supposed to just go in and help death usher my patients in. 
So when my mom dies I can't miss a day to even bury her apparently. 


I think I just needed to vent. I'm hurt as fuck and scared how that maybe they've already decided to fire me but won't say it. 

So I guess I'm just never getting sick again is my point because that's totally possible. And I can't be absent if my mom dies, if my kids need me, whatever. 

Like did I fuck up am I not seeing this correctly? It's a TOTAL 180 from the past 11 months. And even now I'm being asked to work a double tomorrow. The fuck? ",34,1740705218.0,careerguidance,53,0.81,False

1izvtww,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerWoodWorking/comments/1izvtww/table_top_epoxy_questions/,Table top epoxy questions,"So I am making a coffee table. The top, which is 38x22 is made from butternut. I applied an epoxy finish using UVPoxy to only one side at the moment. This side is intended to be the top. Prior to applying the epoxy I applied two coats of Zinsser sealcoat to both sides. I am aware that both sides need to have epoxy applied to prevent unwanted warping or uneven wood movement. My questions are:

Can I simply apply more of a seal coat to the bottom, i.e. paint the epoxy on, rather than a full blown flood coat like I did to the top? Would this be enough to achieve the same amount of ""sealing"" as the top side. I'm trying to avoid having the hardened epoxy drips end up on the side I want to use as the top of the table. 

Also, I would like to achieve a satin finish on the top side. There are some minor imperfections due to a few stray pieces of debris and air bubbles that appeared. Currently it's obviously very glossy. What grit sandpaper should I use? I plan on starting with 320 but not sure if I should plan on going higher? The epoxy layer is pretty thin and I would like to remove as little as possible. Ultimately I would like to apply Natura Onecoat as a final finish. Thank you for any help or advice.

Chapter 3

Painting the town red



There was uncertainty in my mind all these years. I never stop to think that my family was a part of an old history. Her words played in my head, I admit I was told little about my real mother… just that she died giving birth to me. In the next few days I continued to prepare the rough draft of the piece, the story was coming together but I knew there was so much I still didn’t know. *“ sir? Just wanted to drop off the rough draft, I hope I can write more on the piece…""*Vincent sat back his tired eyes looking over the computer screen, I didn’t know how to describe it but he seemed off… *“Thanks, just put it on my desk….* *Wait liz ....”* I froze, the tone of his voice seemed odd as he waved me back into his office. *“Yes sir…”* grabbing his coffee he only took a drink, *“ I wanted to thank you….”* I looked confused as I sat down, he seemed to pick up my piece and flip through the pages. *“ I'm sorry sir, I'm confused, thank you for what?” “ Ms. Smith called and told how sweet you were… you handled it really well.”* I smiled feeling a sense of pride as long as I had been working here, I only hoped for someone to see my hard work. *“ Your welcome I just knew she needed someone to listen from her side, well I can’t take all the credit…my friend gave me the idea about how to talk to her.”* he only rubbed his eyes looking unable to focus, *“ are you ok sir…you look sick..”* he only gave a weak smile nodding his head, *“ yeah i'm ok just been working late hours again… I will take this home and read it… I should be able to get back to you monday.”* I didn’t know what to even think I knew he had a habit of staying after to finish his work, I only nodded leaving his office worried that maybe he was coming down with something. By midafternoon I had almost forgotten about Vincent as my mind was focused on my own family…. *“ was the Evans really a part of our bloodline?”* there was only confusion in my mind as I got into my car, before all of this I was just your everyday reporter trying to make it.I must have spent countless hours in my office, thinking about nothing but my family and the possible chance that these abilities could aid in my search for the truth. *“Where to begin… I only know so much of my past…”*  I thought of my foster family wondering if they had been kept in the dark about this? 



*“ maybe start with my mother’s name and her life, that had to answer something…”* my mind was lost so much I didn’t know and yet all I wanted was peace from this hell. *“Liz … Maggie's on the phone..she sounds troubled”* I never knew maggie to lose her cool, in fact she was the most well balanced person you could ever meet. I thanked as he waved goodnight, quickly grabbing my phone and I dialed Maggie's number. It only rang twice before she answered, her quicken tone made me worry, *“thank god finally!!!! Something bad happened at the diner…. I can’t talk about it here…”* she was stressed that was for sure, I calmed her down telling her to meet me at my house… I knew by the tone in her voice she had seen something horrible. I was nervous the whole ride home, only preparing myself for whatever could have happened in this sleepy little town. Arriving home Maggie sat in my driveway. Her pale skin and shocked expression only made me fear what she knew, *“maggie you look horrible…please come in tell me what happened..”* she shook barely able to hold on to her keys, I helped her inside almost feeling her heart racing. *“ it was horrible liz I found her…. All that time in the police station answering all those damn questions.”* I looked lost, almost unsure of what she was even saiding, *“ Maggie just gave it to me straight…. You're losing me..”* she sat back on the couch trying to form the words, as tears fell down her face. *“ there was murder in the diner…. I found…robin laiding in the bathroom with her chest torn open! But her heart was stuck to the wall with a knife… oh god liz she was missing her head!!!* I froze another murder in rizepoint, thinking back to Vincent I wondered if that was why he was so off today. I let cry into my chest, her screams echoing in my ears, I felt odd as images filled my head… I could see through Maggie's eyes as she entered the bathroom. Robin’s body laid against the bathroom wall, as the rib cage was torn open blood flowing onto the floor… her heart pinned to the wall with an odd looking knife.



The fear building as Maggie's screams made the diner look up in shock, *“ what the hell!I'm so sorry you had to see that!!”* she looked almost confused before wiping away the hot tears, *“ robin was just an innocent little thing, we joked that she was the young blood in the diner… barely able to take the craziness during rush hour.”* I let her cry for another few minutes only thinking about the images that I saw, this was the second murder in rizepoint in just a few weeks and yet I wondered if mercy had anything to do with robin’s death. She stayed only for a few hours telling me everything, the police were no help of course grilling everyone in the place. *“ Maggie, I understand this all too much right now, but just breathe…. Maybe some rest will help. I will call tomorrow ok to see how you're doing, come let me help you to your car.”* I watched her drive out of view only hoping she would be ok, once back inside I grabbed the notebook feeling that same strange pull again… this time I was ready as I opened to the next page. *“ back again liz? You wish to learn more of the truth?” “ I have to know there has been another murder, and I feel you're not behind it…. Please let me in.”* she only grins accepting my request, as the bright light flooded the room. I stood back at the farm as the warm sun felt good against my skin, luca worked in field sweat rolling down his face…. As he looked tired and sick. *“Father, mother need you inside… lunch is ready…”* Again mercy rushed past me looking worried as her father pulled another box of food into the shed. Wiping the sweat from his face he nods following mercy back toward the house, *“ your father looks sick in this memory please tell me he will be ok….”* mercy’s ghostly figure stood next to me only looking on with a certain sadness, she didn’t answer at first but only waved for me to follow her. 



Inside the house the family sat quietly as her mother passed plates around, their meal was barely even enough to fill their bellies. *“ we suffered so much more since the judge ordered double of our crops… you notice something off liz?”* I looked closely at the table only noticing three plates that laid on the oak top, *“ your sister she is not here….”* I was lost for words as only imagining what could happen, *“ yes Abby was sick with the plague, my mother tried her best to help her but when the judge was told of her illness….. He did something horrible that changed my family forever… I would rather not say.”* that was anger in her voice. Clearly he had killed poor Abby just to keep the sickness away from the village, only now I knew what was wrong with her father. *“ Father, I can finish your work for you…. You need to rest!”* he seemed almost taken back as the family looked scared, *“ no this my sin to carry…mercy I understand but he already killed your sister.. In front of us all of things… I can’t even get her little cries of pain out of my head.”* luca had lost so much that he had now taken on the work in order for his family to live, the bright light again blinded me but this time I felt an odd chill that filled me with dread. I now stood deep in the woods, mercy and her mother weeping over two tombstones. *“ my father only lasted a few more months before winter, we were alone and scared of the judge*…  *I took on the task of making sure that the village had food for the winter.”* no words were spoken in this moment, only the stillness of the woods around us. *“ you must go! The darkness is not far…they know when you are here… leave liz save yourself!”* her cold fingers wrapping around my body, as the bright light swallowed me I awoke again watching the notebook hit the floor…. I was confused who she was so scared of…even in death she was running from something. Again I wondered about my connection with the evans, there had to be answers… Only now I wasn’t sure if time was on my side any longer. All that night I went through everything about my family, only finding what I already knew… I wanted to scream how could my past be hidden so well? 



There was a certain dread that seemed to stay with me no matter how I tried…it was stronger than I could fight. By early morning I laid back on my bed feeling myself drafting off to sleep, again I was standing in the woods a light snowfall fell around me. *“Where am I…”* my voice sounded different almost like I wasn’t myself, the sound of screaming and yelling echoed around me I panicked and started into a dead run….  *“ Get the witch!!!! Find her…….”* I was being hunted by an unknown force… a group hell bent on killing me. I must have ran forever. I felt like I was running in place as the same trees towered around me, *“ leave me alone I didn’t do anything wrong… mother! Where  is my mother?”* they crowded around me blocking my way, as a strange tall man stood out from the rest… *“ liz val I know what you're doing, the secrets you keep… now I will come for you… see you soon!”* I was shocked awake trying to catch my breath only I felt like I was dying, again smoke seemed to fill my lungs. *“ focus liz don’t let their darkness take you….. We still need to end this terror.”* her voice filled my head almost like a strange angel watching over me, I fought back letting her world push the smoke from my body. Finally I could breathe again as I sat up in bed, my alarm buzzing in my ear, my body was shaking but I could feel her still near me. I spent half the morning just trying to understand the change I had undergone, my life was so different since the notebook. Only now I knew what needed to be done. Grabbing my phone I called Maggie who seemed in a better mood, still she seemed shaken by everything. 



*“ I'm still not able to sleep… nightmare of robin’s body was all I could dream… liz you look tired as well..the same thing?”* I wondered just how much I should let Maggie in on, after all she had alway trusted me to tell her the truth. I swallowed my fear and began to speak, unsure of how to begin. *“Remember the box that lady rose gave me?”* I waited as she nodded her head unsure of what to think, *“something happened when I opened it, I know this is going to sound strange..maybe even crazy but inside was mercy’s notebook her life written into the pages.* She sat back thinking about everything that had happened between the first and second murder, things seemed to become clear to us both. *“Did you read something horrible? Did mercy have a dark past?”* I only paused before bringing the notebook over to the table, she studied it for a few moments before asking to hold it. *“ I don’t know… it did something strange to me you see I didn’t read but saw everything like I was in a day dream.”* she looked almost confused before placing her hand upon my head, *“ what are you doing?” “ checking to see if you're sick… I mean you're talking crazy…”* I admit I was prepared for that answer, Maggie was open minded but to a limit she alway had to see it for herself before she would believe you. *“I'm not crazy…. Fine give me a second…""* She only looked nervous before I placed my hands on her, closing my eyes I felt an odd pull, before I could see her standing in the doorway crying out for someone…only she sounded younger, almost in her teenage years. I could feel her hot tears almost like I wasn’t myself again, it was all clear now this was a memory one that she must keep to herself…. Only her father was still alive. He seemed to bend down, giving her a hug telling her he was sorry for all of this, and to take care of her mother for him….. *“ Im seeing your father he bends down hugging onto you..while your mother yells at him from the entrance way. You beg him not to go, but he ensures it’s best that he leaves…. You never knew your parents were having issues. Wait, now I'm seeing you and mother standing at the door again, but your mother is crying out as a police officer tells the both of you…about your father.”* she pulls herself away from me, almost unable to understand what happened. 



*“ how!? I never told anyone about that…. And you saw all in my memories… holy shit what did that book do to you?* She almost fall back before catching herself, *“ I'm sorry if that was a memory you didn’t know the world to see, I can’t help it whatever you're thinking about I can see and things of your past… mercy had given me this ability.”* she only stood again before grabbing her keys, I watched her rush out the door unable to accept what I was saiding. I tried calling her all through the day, but she only seemed to not answer… I didn’t blame her, I awakened something she didn’t want to remember. All through the rest of the week she seemed to avoid all together, I felt alone for once in my life…. Maggie was my balance. By monday I arrived at my job heartbroken, only wanting to be left alone… there was a cold fearful dread that made me wish I wasn’t there at all. *“ liz good you're here can we talk for a minute?”* Vincent stood in my doorway holding my piece in his hand, he seemed almost pale looking like he had become worse over the weekend. *“Sure come in… you look sick sir… you good?”* he only settled into the chair before looking at himself in the nearby mirror, *“ I know I look horrible…i'm on my way out..just wanted to tell you I loved your paper… so much I wanted you to do a full story on it… I'm giving you the front page.”* I froze as he smiled. This was the break I had been waiting for, I quickly nodded, promising to start the real story. This little bit of news brightened my day, in fact I almost forgot about maggie… until lunch had rolled around. *“ I should just eat at home… Maybe look at starting this story for vincent.""* The drive home was odd to say the least, the diner was still closed down due to robin’s murder..police had reported until they went over the whole crime scene no one was allowed inside.

Gathering my notes in front of me I felt good knowing I had most of the information, the only thing missing was anything about robin and her murder. The police would be no help of course, after all they loved to hide all the details from any reporter who asked. There was only one way to know anything about robin, *“ of course the diner the police had shut it down…think liz the person who could have helped you….* The sadness seemed to hit me hard, had I wronged Maggie by going into her hidden past? Either way she was the only one who could have let me inside the diner, sitting back I didn’t know what to do..like a lost child my mind was filled with fear and doubt. *“ don’t give up liz…. There had to be another way…”* she voice was calm and inviting, almost making me feel like I had an angel to look after me. *“ How mercy? Maggie won’t talk to me…. And I don't think she even answers my text…* *“ she isn’t the only person you know ... .who works at the diner…”* I was confused at first, unable to focus on her words, only for a few anyway as her mother’s image had come into my mind. Betty was like a second mother to me, she alway made sure I was taken care of as a kid… I wondered if she could help me now? Grabbing my phone I stopped knowing the risks, how would Maggie feel if I asked her mother about looking into the diner? ",1,1740705097.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

Then he asked, “what do you think is worse the holocaust or slavery.” And I said you cannot compare them. And he kept trying to get me to say slavery was worse.

1izvqi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1izvqi4/42_m4f_10_very_interesting_things_about_me/,"42 [M4F] 10 ""Very Interesting"" Things About Me.","
1--  I visited a site that is supposed to keep me up to date with what is happening in the neighbourhood, I thought there would be way more about the underground rave seen, but it seems to be run entirely by coyote enthusiasts. Every post in my part of the city about someone seeing a coyote, what time, and in what direction they were headed. Having almost no interest in coyotes (sure, they're cute and I would pet them and tell them that they're very good boys if given the opportunity), I am now seeking other forms of distraction.

2--- I have discovered that I enjoy cooking via some trial and error. A couple of weeks ago I made soup in the slow cooker and thought ""you know what everyone loves in soup? Rice!"" and threw handfuls of rice into the slow cooker in an attempt to ""freestyle it"" and make the soup ""good."" What happened over the next eight hrs is that the rice absorbed any and all liquid and created this grey mush that would have horrified Oliver and his friends at the orphanage. ""Please Sir, we don't want any more."" I understand.

3- As I write this my dogs are sitting on the couch together looking out the window like they are some kind of buddy cops on a stakeout. One is a loose cannon, the other plays it by-the-book (and won most improved dog a million years ago in obedience training!), but together they keep the city safe.  Should they see a cat, squirrel, person, or a plastic bag that they dislike, they will stand up from the couch and bark for a solid three minutes until the neighbourhood knows that the threat from the evil cat/rodent/human/inanimate object had been thwarted, and should you see them on the street while on a walk, you should thank them for keeping these city streets safe. They are not opposed to treats, and wouldn't be opposed to a statue in their likeness.

Once I told them that they jointly won the award for Best Pups as given by the United Nations, and I haven't had the heart to tell them that I made it all up. Should you ever meet them, please don't sell me out, they are so proud. I wouldn't sell you out regarding any lies you tell to your pets/children/place of employment/co-workers/spouse/self, they can believe it all. 

4-- I like the idea of books more than reading seemingly. Every month I buy more books and place them on every available surface until the piles look like they may topple over. Every book that I have ever read has a bus transfer in it from the day that I started the book. Even now where I no longer rely on buses to get me from point a to point b, I will walk to the bus stop by my house, pay three dollars for a bus transfer, ride the bus a single stop, get off and walk home while listening to Nick Cave or something. 

When I was a kid I bought a copy of Breakfast of Champions by Vonnegut at a garage sale and inside was a bus transfer from 1978, and that blew my mind to have a piece of paper from before I was even born. I guess I had the idea that although I am told that the earth is millions and billions and bajillions of years old, I had never seen proof of this until I had that bus transfer in my hand. And so I keep transfers in all of my books in case I, one day, sell my collection of barely read books, and in doing so, I can make a small child feel insignificant.

5--- I stand 6'2"", A lot of great men were much shorter than me. Muggsy Bogues (5'3""), James Madison (5'3""), Winston Churchill (5'5""), John F Kennedy (6'0), Michael J Fox (5'3""),  Daniel Radcliffe (5'4""), and Dax Shepard (6'1""). Donald  Trump claims to be 6'2"", but he has the hands of a toddler, so I am claiming height supremacy over him. 

I am not a religious person, but if the average male height is 5'9"", then that would make me taller than most, and if height brings you closer to God (see Genesis 11:1-9), then I guess that makes me a godly person. I am not sure that I subscribe to that though, as I am friends with someone (humble brag) who is 6'5"" and he is a real piece of work.

6-- You can take me to parties and all of your friends will be shocked at how introverted I am. ""He doesn't talk much, does he?"" they will ask when they think I am out of earshot (but, I am not, and hearing that hurts), or, ""Is he always like this? You've heard him speak, right?"" and you have it just takes me a little time to warm up, and then you can't get me to shut up.
  
At this stage in our friendship, my lack of noise will be one of the things that you find most endearing about me. You'll mistake it for mystery or depth, you'd be wrong, but I find it very sweet all the same. Please mistake this initial quiet as a sign that I am a really good listener. Please mistake my ability to ask very good questions as a sign of interest, and not a desperate attempt that I would prefer you to speak so that I don't have to.

7-- I enjoy pop culture references and will sprinkle them in whenever I possible can. I do them all, literary, tv, movies, music. I am very proud of them, so please point them out when they are made to reassure me that it was caught, appreciated, and we are all in awe at how very big my brain is. Big brain, big personality, it is my guarantee. 

8--- I am impossibly brave. Yesterday I went to the grocery store without crying. Now I know how those brave young men felt on D-Day storming those Normany Beaches, them getting shelled, me shopping for cauliflower.

9--- I was told by a drag performer that I like broadway and RuPaul's Dragrace way too much to possibly be a straight man. 

10-- I am allergic to cats. But, I really love cats. I think they're great. I had a colleague at an old job who says that she is allergic to cats, but actually just hates cats. When I first met her, I tried to bond with her, as people often do, over our mutual allergies. She notified me that she actually isn't allergic, but just really dislikes them. So, I want you o know that my cat allergy is genuine, and you deserve the truth, and I swear on my itchy, burning eyes that I will always give it to you (which is sort of weird to say in a sub-reddit like this)

January 15th, 2020. 4AM. Illuminati Haven.

Two guards outside the Haven stood at attention, one on each side of the entry gate. The silence of the waning night had begun to fade, and the faint glow of dawn had begun to emerge. The two soldiers looked from left to right, always alert. With the arrival of the first Trueborn in decades, they could not afford to slack off.

They did not speak to one another. Cameras swiveled back and forth overhead, searching the jungle for heat signatures and other hostile blips. Each of the guards hefted heavy rifles capable of blasting holes through the bodies of all but the most durable of Dukes. Against Demon Emperors, they might not kill them, but they'd likely cause some pain before the guards met their end.

A bird chirped to the right, causing both guards to snap their eyes in that direction. Reflexively, they took aim with their rifles and narrowed their eyes, looking for the 'creature' that may have made the noise. They were all too familiar with demon tricks, and knew there were all sorts of esoteric and frightening demonic abilities that could easily fool their mundane human minds.

The rightmost guard continued to look to the right, but the left guard instead turned to look in the opposite direction. He realized if something did make a noise, it could have been a distraction to sneak up on the opposite side.

Hardly had he turned his head to look, when a figure suddenly emerged out of nothing, as if revealing itself by stepping through a crack between dimensions. The guard's eyes widened. He started to open his mouth, to shout, to alert his comrade, but the figure lifted its arm and pointed something at his face.

Before he could react, his vision went black, and he collapsed on the ground.

The sound of his body hitting the dirt was enough to draw the attention of the other guard. He quickly swiveled around, only to catch sight of a humanoid figure wearing a black business suit, and a white mask with strange markings he couldn't make out in the dim light of dawn.

An instant later, his vision went black too. He collapsed under the attack of the silent weapon his attacker shot at him.

The attacker smiled under his mask.

""Step one, complete. Let's do the rest right this time.""

...................................

**[Recommended Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7_5XhpDy0A)**

Inside the Haven, all was quiet. The fall of the guards outside didn't set off any alarm bells. Every fifteen minutes, the command center would ping each pair of guards on the premises, getting the secret code-word for their patrol. When they pinged the exterior guards, they received the all-clear without hesitation.

The mysterious mask-wearing attacker grabbed the wrist of the first guard. He placed the guard's hand on the control panel to activate it with his palm print, then he lifted the guard's head up to scan his iris.

Finally, the vocal component of the entryway came up. The suited man leaned over the mic and spoke, his voice changing to perfectly mimic the guard's voice, despite never actually speaking before.

""Jericho-9-0-2.""

The gate silently slid open. The man smiled under his mask. He dropped the guard and casually walked inside.

Seemingly an idiot, he brazenly walked right past multiple cameras, as if not caring at all. Despite this, at the exact moment he entered each camera's path, the person looking at that particular camera happened to look away, either to examine another camera's image, or to take a sip of their coffee, or to speak to a coworker.

Coincidentally, time after time, the masked man paused for half a breath, then walked forward, carefully timing his walking motions while occasionally glancing at a wristwatch that displayed not only the minutes and seconds, but even a rolling number of milliseconds as well.

After breaching the base, the masked man casually strolled toward the secondary entrance leading downward. He took a coin out of his pocket and flicked it up into the air. The coin sailed noiselessly into the darkness of dawn, where it loudly clinked against a metal trash can, causing several people nearby to jump in alarm and turn to look at it.

As if playing a stealth video game on easy mode, the masked man walked right behind the people while their backs were turned. Someone else happened to walk inside right before he did, so he slipped through the entry door behind them, pressed a device to the back of their head, and pulled the trigger.

Their body hit the floor right as the door closed, muffling the noise.

The masked man paused for half a breath. His body blurred slightly, and he mumbled under his breath, ""One-one-four, right, left, six seconds...""

He brusquely grabbed the person laying in front of him by their shirt collar, dragged them past three sets of doors, took a right and a left, then tossed the person inside. He silently shut the door, then he began to do something extremely bizarre.

He moonwalked backward, ducking his body as he passed by a window. Coincidentally, at that very moment, someone turned their head to look outside, but they failed to notice the intruder doing an odd Michael Jackson impression just below their field of view.

As if listening to some invisible tune, the intruder began dancing while he walked, bending his body in odd ways, slipping around doorways, dodging one person after another, always evading their line of sight as if he were able to predict the future. Like a ghost, he entered the second level of the Haven, then the third without tripping a single alarm. Nobody saw him even once, save for the guards outside, who remained comatose, unable to move.

Abruptly, the masked man paused as he came up to a door with a numerical keypad.

""Fuck. This is gonna be a pain.""

His body blurred. Three seconds passed. His position seemed to remain unmoving, but after those three seconds, he leaned forward and typed in a 12-digit number.

_1-1-7-9-5-4-2-7-6-1-2-0_

The door beeped once, then slip open.

As it opened, the masked man's shoulders slumped. ""Fucking hell. _Fuck._ I'd better not have to do that again. At least the digit only started with 'one' this time.""

He cursed under his breath, then slipped deeper into the facility.

Not five minutes after first waltzing in the front door, he smoothly arrived at his ultimate destination. He poked his head out of a doorway and glanced down the hallway outside, where he saw a young woman, only twenty or so years old, standing guard outside a seemingly ordinary room.

The man's body blurred for a moment, then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small walkie-talkie looking device and spoke into it.

""Natalie, this is Claire. Is the Trueborn still sleeping?""

Natalie Summers blinked. She reached up to touch her earpiece, then looked off to the side, in the opposite direction the intruder happened to be standing.

""He is, ma'am. Is something the matter?""

""Yes."" The man said, his voice coming out a perfect recreation of Claire's. ""I've just received word that he needs to pay Bloodworks a visit. Please enter his dormitory and wake him up. Get him down here, immediately. His life is in peril.""

Natalie's eyebrows shot up in alarm. ""Of course. I'm on my way.""

She hurriedly turned around and typed in a series of numbers on the door's control panel, numbers the intruder recorded with relative ease. The moment she entered the room, he stepped into the hallway and darted toward the room. His shoes silently struck the ground, far too quietly despite striking hard tiles that should have made at least a slight clicking noise.

Natalie stepped into the room. ""Jason-""

She started to speak, but at that moment, something pressed against the back of her head, and her vision turned black. She collapsed to the ground, but the intruder quickly leaned forward to catch her, allowing her to lay down without suffering a dangerous fall.

Jason Hiro awoke with a start. His heart turned cold as Natalie abruptly woke him up, then fell over, a man in a black dress suit appearing behind her.

""What the fuck?!"" Jason exclaimed, his heart turning cold. He had barely even woken up, and already, he felt his life was in existential danger!

In the darkness of his room, Jason couldn't pick up on many details. All he could tell was that the intruder looked to be a male, relatively muscular, wearing a black dress suit and... was that a mask? A Japanese mask? And why did it have the image of a cat painted on it?

""Who-?"" Jason started to ask, but before he could get the words out, the masked man held up three fingers.

""Firstly: I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to rescue you."" The man said, his voice gruff. ""Secondly, you may call me 'Cat Mask.' Thirdly: The Illuminati are not your allies. You are right to suspect them. If you want to live free, come with me.""

Jason blinked twice. He stared at the man, his mouth agape.

""I-""

""Your clothes are over there. And no, Natalie isn't dead. She's just unconscious. I have a weapon that can induce an abrupt shock to any human's cerebral cortex. It's non-lethal, but only works at short range. Now hurry up and put your pants on. We have seven minutes and fourteen seconds before all hell breaks loose here.""

Jason nodded dumbly. His first instinct was not to trust this person, but something about his cool confidence made Jason faintly want to believe in him. More importantly, Jason was already planning to escape. Wasn't this timing... just too good??

Without delay, Jason grabbed a pair of pants. He threw them on, looking at Natalie with a hint of worry, but luckily she didn't appear injured. She simply lay unmoving, her chest rising and falling as if having entered a deep sleep.

Carefully, Jason stepped over her, but couldn't help looking back at her one last time...

""Relax. The pretty girl will be just fine."" Cat Mask said with a quiet chuckle. ""Now, follow my lead. If I tell you to duck your head, you duck it, got it? We'll be out of here in four minutes and sixteen seconds if everything works out just the way I've planned.""

Jason nodded dumbly. ""Alright..""

He followed along behind Cat Mask as they power-walked down the hallway Cat Mask came from. Periodically, Cat Mask would do something bizarre, like moonwalking while bending forward, but each of those time, Jason just crawled along the ground. He felt like an idiot compared to Cat Mask's cool and smooth moves.

Two minutes passed. The two of them made it up to the first floor, and Cat Mask abruptly paused. His body blurred for a moment, something Jason had grown used to seeing, though he had no idea what the hell the man was doing.

Suddenly, Cat Mask pulled a walkie-talkie device out of his pocket. He spoke into it, his voice changing to a familiar feminine one.

""All personnel, this is Claire Rothschild speaking. The Trueborn has gone missing. He has attacked his handler and is presumed to be attempting an escape. Immediately surround the second and third levels. Keep an eye out for him. Under no circumstances are you to use lethal force.""

Jason blinked. He was internally shocked beyond belief! Cat Mask had perfectly replicated Claire's voice... _but how_? And wouldn't sending the base into high alert compromise their mission?!

Cat Mask looked at Jason for half a beat. ""Relax. I've done this a thousand times. We just have to wait eight more seconds, then we'll be get moving.""

Cat Mask glanced down at his wristwatch. Exactly seven seconds later, he stepped out of the doorway on the first floor right as a pair of men ran past. Jason tensed up, but the two men were so distracted that they didn't notice Cat Mask and Jason emerging from right behind them.

What coincidental timing!

Silently, Cat Mask weaved his way around barrels and boxes stacked around the top level of the base, just outside. He led Jason to the exterior gate, and they walked right in front of the cameras, causing Jason to fear someone might have seen him. But what he did not know was that at that very moment, the guard assigned to check that camera had looked away to comb the level 2 and 3 cameras instead, just barely missing Jason and Cat Mask as they walked past.

After stepping outside the Haven's walls, Cat Mask's breathing sped up. He quickly gestured.

""Come on, kid. We'll have to run, now. I've got a quad outside waiting to pick us up. Let's move it!""

Jason nodded. He didn't know how the hell they were going to escape the entire Illuminati on a freaking ATV, but anything was better than just standing around, waiting for rescue. He and Cat Mask both started jogging as they disappeared into the woods. Along the way, Jason spotted several fallen guards who were supposed to be patrolling the woods. Clearly, Cat Mask had taken them down before he even drew close to the base.

Ten minutes later, they slid down the side of a shallow ravine. Before them, there was an open area nestled inside a natural bowl-like part of the hillside. Jason looked left and right, but he didn't see any sort of escape vehicle.

""We're here."" Cat Mask said, retrieving a remote from his pocket.

He pressed a button, and Jason's jaw nearly hit the ground.

A small helicopter, made of a shiny silvery material he guessed was platinum, greeted his eyes. The copter did not have rotors on its top, but instead it was built like a hovercraft with one internal rotor on each of its four 'corners', made for stealth operations. Just by looking at it, Jason had a sudden hunch, a guess that frightened him to his core.

_This copter... it's way more advanced than anything I've ever seen!_ Jason exclaimed internally. _This looks like some kind of air vehicle pulled from fifty years in the future! Or is this a top-secret government copter? Something even the US Air Force would keep under lock and key? Just who the hell is this guy?!_

Cat Mask hopped into the pilot's seat. Jason climbed in beside him via the co-pilot's door.

As the doors closed behind them, Cat Mask turned his whole head to look at Jason.

""Don't touch anything. I mean it. Don't press even one button. I know you want to. _Don't._ We have one minute and forty-seven seconds to escape this airspace. Just sit still, and this will all be over.""

Jason nodded. ""Okay...""

Cat Masks's body blurred again. Each time he did that, it confused Jason more and more. What exactly was happening whenever he did that?

Jason secretly guessed this guy wasn't a human at all. Maybe he was a demon, or even an angel. Could he be one of the Lowborn? Could that be why he was so incredible at infiltration? Maybe he had some powerful ability that was able to allow him to evade even a monolith as powerful as the Illuminati.

The quad-copter lifted off. Jason shifted in his seat as he felt a few G's pull his stomach into his ass.

Then, the copter turned invisible and shot off into the darkened sky.

""We're not in the clear yet."" Cat Mask said, after they had traveled a mile or two. ""Hold your questions until I give the OK. The Illuminati have aerial assets they can deploy. They can also call on the local Air Force bases if need be.""

Jason's eyes flickered with insight. _So this guy isn't with the Air Force? Is he not even part of the US Government?_

""No, I'm not."" Cat Mask said, startling Jason. ""I'm a lone agent. Unaffiliated with any other group.""

Jason's jaw dropped. ""You can read-?!""

""Nope. Not a telepath."" Cat Mask simply said. ""Now, hold the questions.""

Jason bit his tongue. His mind swirled as he thought of a thousand other questions he wanted to ask. Every time Cat Mask spoke, it simply added another layer to the mystery surrounding him.

Just who the hell WAS this guy?!

Minutes later, Cat Mask sagged in the pilot's chair. He exhaled deeply.

""Mission success. Attempts: Seven hundred and fourteen thousand, nine hundred, sixteen.""

Jason scrunched up his face. ""Huh? Attempts?""

To his surprise, Cat Mask looked at him for a moment.

Then, he reached up and pulled off the mask, revealing his face underneath.

Jason looked at the man's true visage. He was surprised to see that, despite his deeply American way of speaking, Cat Mask was actually a blonde haired Asian man. Korean? Japanese? Jason thought he looked more Japanese than anything else.

The man had narrow eyebrows and a faint mustache. He was relatively clean-shaven, and only looked to be in his 40's. Not old by any means, but certainly a bit advanced in age.

""Hey, Jason."" Cat Mask said, smiling at him. ""You really screwed things up for me again. Haha...""

Jason frowned. ""Do I know you?""

Cat Mask's expression slumped a little. He looked away.

You did. Once. Or Twice. Or even a thousand times. But it was never destined to work out. That's why I had to leave you behind when you were a kid. It's been eating me up, all this time.""

Jason's heart plunged into his shoes. A cold, icy feeling swelled within his chest.

""W-what...? You... you're not... you _can't_ be?""

""Yeah. I am. It's me."" The man said. ""I'm Hideki. Hideki Hiro. I'm your father, Jason.""

Silence filled the cockpit. Jason stared at the man claiming to be his father. His eyes trembled.

""You... my... father? No. That's not... my father died. When I was... and my mom, too.""

Hideki pursed his lips. As the copter flew, he lowered his eyes.

""I tried to save her. So many times. I went to medical school for hundreds of years. I went back again and again. I did everything I could. But always... she died during childbirth. And she wouldn't let me undo your birth. She told me I had to raise you well. To make sure you grew up and lived a good life.""

Hideki chuckled humorlessly.

""In the end, I couldn't even do that much. The fate of the Earth was at stake. I had it all planned out... everything had to proceed according to one path. You would end up in that cryopod and be saved, someday returning to restore humanity, long after my death.""

Hideki looked at Jason, an indescribable emotion in his eyes.

""This was supposed to be the last rewind. Everything was all set up. So, Jason... how the HELL did you end up falling into the Illuminati's clutches?! Nothing like that should have ever happened! I accounted for EVERY variable!""

Jason blinked. He pulled away from Hideki, his own confusion mixing with anger and disbelief. ""YOU wanted me to be in the cryopod? You?? But- no wait, why would you abandon me? What's this about 'rewinding'? What in the hell is even going on right now?!""

Hideki coughed. He looked out the window and adjusted course slightly.

""Right. Sometimes I forget that I have to re-explain everything every single time. It gets tiring after a while. Luckily I've become the most patient Sentient in all the universe or I'd have gone insane millions of years ago.""

Hideki cleared his throat. He continued to look out the window as he spoke.

""I am a Hero, Jason. A Trueborn Hero, just like you. Due to a variety of extenuating circumstances, my Heroic potential passed on to you as a child, and you became capable of great feats. As for me, my power is simple. I am a temporal manipulator. I can speed up or slow down my perception of time, and I can rewind time to any point in the past, provided that moment is not before my 16th birthday when my powers awakened.""

Cat Mask's smile turned dour. ""I have rewound time more times than you can imagine. I am far older than the oldest living Volgrim. My age even compares to the oldest living Titans at this point. I've seen things you wouldn't believe...""

Jason coughed. ""You can rewind time?! Holy shit! That's amazing! But what's this about 'Volgrim?'? I'm going to die of shock-induced heart attacks at this rate!""

Cat Mask chuckled. ""It's funny. You say something similar every time we've had these discussions. Ah, how some things never change...""",15,1740704773.0,HFY,18,1.0,False

Two guards outside the Haven stood at attention, one on each side of the entry gate. The silence of the waning night had begun to fade, and the faint glow of dawn had begun to emerge. The two soldiers looked from left to right, always alert. With the arrival of the first Trueborn in decades, they could not afford to slack off.

They did not speak to one another. Cameras swiveled back and forth overhead, searching the jungle for heat signatures and other hostile blips. Each of the guards hefted heavy rifles capable of blasting holes through the bodies of all but the most durable of Dukes. Against Demon Emperors, they might not kill them, but they'd likely cause some pain before the guards met their end.

A bird chirped to the right, causing both guards to snap their eyes in that direction. Reflexively, they took aim with their rifles and narrowed their eyes, looking for the 'creature' that may have made the noise. They were all too familiar with demon tricks, and knew there were all sorts of esoteric and frightening demonic abilities that could easily fool their mundane human minds.

The rightmost guard continued to look to the right, but the left guard instead turned to look in the opposite direction. He realized if something did make a noise, it could have been a distraction to sneak up on the opposite side.

Hardly had he turned his head to look, when a figure suddenly emerged out of nothing, as if revealing itself by stepping through a crack between dimensions. The guard's eyes widened. He started to open his mouth, to shout, to alert his comrade, but the figure lifted its arm and pointed something at his face.

Before he could react, his vision went black, and he collapsed on the ground.

The sound of his body hitting the dirt was enough to draw the attention of the other guard. He quickly swiveled around, only to catch sight of a humanoid figure wearing a black business suit, and a white mask with strange markings he couldn't make out in the dim light of dawn.

An instant later, his vision went black too. He collapsed under the attack of the silent weapon his attacker shot at him.

The attacker smiled under his mask.

""Step one, complete. Let's do the rest right this time.""

...................................

**[Recommended Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7_5XhpDy0A)**

Inside the Haven, all was quiet. The fall of the guards outside didn't set off any alarm bells. Every fifteen minutes, the command center would ping each pair of guards on the premises, getting the secret code-word for their patrol. When they pinged the exterior guards, they received the all-clear without hesitation.

The mysterious mask-wearing attacker grabbed the wrist of the first guard. He placed the guard's hand on the control panel to activate it with his palm print, then he lifted the guard's head up to scan his iris.

Finally, the vocal component of the entryway came up. The suited man leaned over the mic and spoke, his voice changing to perfectly mimic the guard's voice, despite never actually speaking before.

""Jericho-9-0-2.""

The gate silently slid open. The man smiled under his mask. He dropped the guard and casually walked inside.

Seemingly an idiot, he brazenly walked right past multiple cameras, as if not caring at all. Despite this, at the exact moment he entered each camera's path, the person looking at that particular camera happened to look away, either to examine another camera's image, or to take a sip of their coffee, or to speak to a coworker.

Coincidentally, time after time, the masked man paused for half a breath, then walked forward, carefully timing his walking motions while occasionally glancing at a wristwatch that displayed not only the minutes and seconds, but even a rolling number of milliseconds as well.

After breaching the base, the masked man casually strolled toward the secondary entrance leading downward. He took a coin out of his pocket and flicked it up into the air. The coin sailed noiselessly into the darkness of dawn, where it loudly clinked against a metal trash can, causing several people nearby to jump in alarm and turn to look at it.

As if playing a stealth video game on easy mode, the masked man walked right behind the people while their backs were turned. Someone else happened to walk inside right before he did, so he slipped through the entry door behind them, pressed a device to the back of their head, and pulled the trigger.

Their body hit the floor right as the door closed, muffling the noise.

The masked man paused for half a breath. His body blurred slightly, and he mumbled under his breath, ""One-one-four, right, left, six seconds...""

He brusquely grabbed the person laying in front of him by their shirt collar, dragged them past three sets of doors, took a right and a left, then tossed the person inside. He silently shut the door, then he began to do something extremely bizarre.

He moonwalked backward, ducking his body as he passed by a window. Coincidentally, at that very moment, someone turned their head to look outside, but they failed to notice the intruder doing an odd Michael Jackson impression just below their field of view.

As if listening to some invisible tune, the intruder began dancing while he walked, bending his body in odd ways, slipping around doorways, dodging one person after another, always evading their line of sight as if he were able to predict the future. Like a ghost, he entered the second level of the Haven, then the third without tripping a single alarm. Nobody saw him even once, save for the guards outside, who remained comatose, unable to move.

Abruptly, the masked man paused as he came up to a door with a numerical keypad.

""Fuck. This is gonna be a pain.""

His body blurred. Three seconds passed. His position seemed to remain unmoving, but after those three seconds, he leaned forward and typed in a 12-digit number.

_1-1-7-9-5-4-2-7-6-1-2-0_

The door beeped once, then slip open.

As it opened, the masked man's shoulders slumped. ""Fucking hell. _Fuck._ I'd better not have to do that again. At least the digit only started with 'one' this time.""

He cursed under his breath, then slipped deeper into the facility.

Not five minutes after first waltzing in the front door, he smoothly arrived at his ultimate destination. He poked his head out of a doorway and glanced down the hallway outside, where he saw a young woman, only twenty or so years old, standing guard outside a seemingly ordinary room.

The man's body blurred for a moment, then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small walkie-talkie looking device and spoke into it.

""Natalie, this is Claire. Is the Trueborn still sleeping?""

Natalie Summers blinked. She reached up to touch her earpiece, then looked off to the side, in the opposite direction the intruder happened to be standing.

""He is, ma'am. Is something the matter?""

""Yes."" The man said, his voice coming out a perfect recreation of Claire's. ""I've just received word that he needs to pay Bloodworks a visit. Please enter his dormitory and wake him up. Get him down here, immediately. His life is in peril.""

Natalie's eyebrows shot up in alarm. ""Of course. I'm on my way.""

She hurriedly turned around and typed in a series of numbers on the door's control panel, numbers the intruder recorded with relative ease. The moment she entered the room, he stepped into the hallway and darted toward the room. His shoes silently struck the ground, far too quietly despite striking hard tiles that should have made at least a slight clicking noise.

Natalie stepped into the room. ""Jason-""

She started to speak, but at that moment, something pressed against the back of her head, and her vision turned black. She collapsed to the ground, but the intruder quickly leaned forward to catch her, allowing her to lay down without suffering a dangerous fall.

Jason Hiro awoke with a start. His heart turned cold as Natalie abruptly woke him up, then fell over, a man in a black dress suit appearing behind her.

""What the fuck?!"" Jason exclaimed, his heart turning cold. He had barely even woken up, and already, he felt his life was in existential danger!

In the darkness of his room, Jason couldn't pick up on many details. All he could tell was that the intruder looked to be a male, relatively muscular, wearing a black dress suit and... was that a mask? A Japanese mask? And why did it have the image of a cat painted on it?

""Who-?"" Jason started to ask, but before he could get the words out, the masked man held up three fingers.

""Firstly: I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to rescue you."" The man said, his voice gruff. ""Secondly, you may call me 'Cat Mask.' Thirdly: The Illuminati are not your allies. You are right to suspect them. If you want to live free, come with me.""

Jason blinked twice. He stared at the man, his mouth agape.

""I-""

""Your clothes are over there. And no, Natalie isn't dead. She's just unconscious. I have a weapon that can induce an abrupt shock to any human's cerebral cortex. It's non-lethal, but only works at short range. Now hurry up and put your pants on. We have seven minutes and fourteen seconds before all hell breaks loose here.""

Jason nodded dumbly. His first instinct was not to trust this person, but something about his cool confidence made Jason faintly want to believe in him. More importantly, Jason was already planning to escape. Wasn't this timing... just too good??

Without delay, Jason grabbed a pair of pants. He threw them on, looking at Natalie with a hint of worry, but luckily she didn't appear injured. She simply lay unmoving, her chest rising and falling as if having entered a deep sleep.

Carefully, Jason stepped over her, but couldn't help looking back at her one last time...

""Relax. The pretty girl will be just fine."" Cat Mask said with a quiet chuckle. ""Now, follow my lead. If I tell you to duck your head, you duck it, got it? We'll be out of here in four minutes and sixteen seconds if everything works out just the way I've planned.""

Jason nodded dumbly. ""Alright..""

He followed along behind Cat Mask as they power-walked down the hallway Cat Mask came from. Periodically, Cat Mask would do something bizarre, like moonwalking while bending forward, but each of those time, Jason just crawled along the ground. He felt like an idiot compared to Cat Mask's cool and smooth moves.

Two minutes passed. The two of them made it up to the first floor, and Cat Mask abruptly paused. His body blurred for a moment, something Jason had grown used to seeing, though he had no idea what the hell the man was doing.

Suddenly, Cat Mask pulled a walkie-talkie device out of his pocket. He spoke into it, his voice changing to a familiar feminine one.

""All personnel, this is Claire Rothschild speaking. The Trueborn has gone missing. He has attacked his handler and is presumed to be attempting an escape. Immediately surround the second and third levels. Keep an eye out for him. Under no circumstances are you to use lethal force.""

Jason blinked. He was internally shocked beyond belief! Cat Mask had perfectly replicated Claire's voice... _but how_? And wouldn't sending the base into high alert compromise their mission?!

Cat Mask looked at Jason for half a beat. ""Relax. I've done this a thousand times. We just have to wait eight more seconds, then we'll be get moving.""

Cat Mask glanced down at his wristwatch. Exactly seven seconds later, he stepped out of the doorway on the first floor right as a pair of men ran past. Jason tensed up, but the two men were so distracted that they didn't notice Cat Mask and Jason emerging from right behind them.

What coincidental timing!

Silently, Cat Mask weaved his way around barrels and boxes stacked around the top level of the base, just outside. He led Jason to the exterior gate, and they walked right in front of the cameras, causing Jason to fear someone might have seen him. But what he did not know was that at that very moment, the guard assigned to check that camera had looked away to comb the level 2 and 3 cameras instead, just barely missing Jason and Cat Mask as they walked past.

After stepping outside the Haven's walls, Cat Mask's breathing sped up. He quickly gestured.

""Come on, kid. We'll have to run, now. I've got a quad outside waiting to pick us up. Let's move it!""

Jason nodded. He didn't know how the hell they were going to escape the entire Illuminati on a freaking ATV, but anything was better than just standing around, waiting for rescue. He and Cat Mask both started jogging as they disappeared into the woods. Along the way, Jason spotted several fallen guards who were supposed to be patrolling the woods. Clearly, Cat Mask had taken them down before he even drew close to the base.

Ten minutes later, they slid down the side of a shallow ravine. Before them, there was an open area nestled inside a natural bowl-like part of the hillside. Jason looked left and right, but he didn't see any sort of escape vehicle.

""We're here."" Cat Mask said, retrieving a remote from his pocket.

He pressed a button, and Jason's jaw nearly hit the ground.

A small helicopter, made of a shiny silvery material he guessed was platinum, greeted his eyes. The copter did not have rotors on its top, but instead it was built like a hovercraft with one internal rotor on each of its four 'corners', made for stealth operations. Just by looking at it, Jason had a sudden hunch, a guess that frightened him to his core.

_This copter... it's way more advanced than anything I've ever seen!_ Jason exclaimed internally. _This looks like some kind of air vehicle pulled from fifty years in the future! Or is this a top-secret government copter? Something even the US Air Force would keep under lock and key? Just who the hell is this guy?!_

Cat Mask hopped into the pilot's seat. Jason climbed in beside him via the co-pilot's door.

As the doors closed behind them, Cat Mask turned his whole head to look at Jason.

""Don't touch anything. I mean it. Don't press even one button. I know you want to. _Don't._ We have one minute and forty-seven seconds to escape this airspace. Just sit still, and this will all be over.""

Jason nodded. ""Okay...""

Cat Masks's body blurred again. Each time he did that, it confused Jason more and more. What exactly was happening whenever he did that?

Jason secretly guessed this guy wasn't a human at all. Maybe he was a demon, or even an angel. Could he be one of the Lowborn? Could that be why he was so incredible at infiltration? Maybe he had some powerful ability that was able to allow him to evade even a monolith as powerful as the Illuminati.

The quad-copter lifted off. Jason shifted in his seat as he felt a few G's pull his stomach into his ass.

Then, the copter turned invisible and shot off into the darkened sky.

""We're not in the clear yet."" Cat Mask said, after they had traveled a mile or two. ""Hold your questions until I give the OK. The Illuminati have aerial assets they can deploy. They can also call on the local Air Force bases if need be.""

Minutes later, Cat Mask sagged in the pilot's chair. He exhaled deeply.

""Mission success. Attempts: Seven hundred and fourteen thousand, nine hundred, sixteen.""

Jason scrunched up his face. ""Huh? Attempts?""

To his surprise, Cat Mask looked at him for a moment.

Then, he reached up and pulled off the mask, revealing his face underneath.

It's like the modern-day version of Hamlet's ""To be or not to be,"" but with fewer skulls and more screen glare.
So, here's my tale of woe and redemption (kind of). I had a trusty 2016 Kobo Aura One--a solid companion that had seen me through countless reading sessions. But alas, it lacked dark mode. Naturally, I turned to my iPad, because what better way to ruin your sleep than by blasting your eyeballs with blue light at 02:00? Spoiler: I was sleeping like absolute garbage.

Enter Koreader, the supposed savior of my Aura One. It promised dark mode and a world of possibilities! But instead, it delivered… confusion. So many gestures! So much customization! It felt like trying to pilot a spaceship when all I wanted was to read a book. With frustration mounting, I decided it was time for an upgrade—something sleek, something modern, something not Android (because: no!).

I'm a sucker for the 7-8"" size (Goldilocks vibes: not too big, not too small), so I narrowed it down to the Kobo Libra 2 and the PocketBook Era or InkPad 4. Cue hours of obsessive research (thanks, Reddit and YouTube rabbit holes) until I stumbled upon a sweet deal on a refurbished PocketBook InkPad 4. People, I bought it. And wow—what a beauty! The build quality? Chef's kiss. The buttons? Satisfyingly clicky. Sideloading? A breeze. Suddenly, I was reading more than ever before—no more iPad distractions—and my old KA1 found a new home with my son, who couldn't care less about dark mode.

And they all lived happily ever after… right? WRONG.

Plot twist: I couldn't resist Koreader's siren song again. Everyone raves about it, and honestly, PocketBook's built-in reading stats are about as exciting as watching paint dry. So, back down the rabbit hole I went—this time determined to conquer Koreader's quirks. After some serious tinkering (and maybe a few exasperating curses), I finally got it just right. Now? Love it. Stats galore! Customization heaven! It's like taming a wild beast and ending up with a loyal pet.

But wait—there's more! Because apparently, one eReader isn't enough for me now. Nope, I'm officially addicted and dreaming of adding a 6"" eReader to my collection for those ""on-the-go"" moments (read: sipping coffee somewhere during longer walks). So here we are again: Kobo Clara (because juggling two systems sounds like chaotic fun....) or PocketBook Verse Pro (to keep things in the family)? And perhaps make it spicy by going for the color version this time because why not?

The house was quiet.

Not just quiet in the sense that there was no music playing, no TV buzzing in the background, but the kind of quiet that settled in when a place had been empty for too long, when the walls had forgotten what it was like to hear laughter, or life, or anything other than the occasional creak of the foundation settling.

My mother was gone.

Again.

It was happening more often now—her disappearing for days at a time, probably drifting from one barstool to another, one man’s bed to the next, calling home just enough to make sure the electricity stayed on, the fridge was stocked, and the house still looked like someone lived here.

But it didn’t feel like anyone did.

I walked up the short flight of steps that seemed to get longer with every stride, headed for my parents’ room, looking for answers. I sat down on the untouched bed, which responded to my weight with the faint sound of creaking springs. I reached under the bed, grasping my father’s old wooden chest, pulling it up onto my lap, feeling the familiar weight of it in my hands. Once again, the brass latches opened with a click and inside were all my father’s worldly possessions. His old photographs, a scarf, a set of dog tags, a deck of playing cards, and a well-worn Bible with a faded golden trim. Last time, I’d reached for the weapon, but this time I reached for the book, firmly grasping the leather-bound tome, opening it to a random page. 

I had expected the small black print that you could expect to find within most bibles, but I hadn’t expected my father’s handwriting alongside it, pages and pages of notes, scribbled into the margins, paired with verses and filled with knowledge. There were several diagrams, depicting several gruesome looking beasts. I flipped through it quickly at first, marveling at the detail and the amount of time he must have spent writing this all down. My idly moving fingers stopped when I read the word exorcism. My heart pounded in my chest as I quickly read through the pages, my pulse rate going higher as I realized that this was exactly what I needed. Somehow, my father had known this day would come.

I must have sat there for hours, poring through the handwritten manuscript contained within the margins of the scripture, absorbing every drop of information that I could glean from the brittle pages. He had been researching how to ward off spirits, cleanse a soul, and even how to cast out powerful demons.

I kept the book in my hand as I descended the steps to find Mac and Heather, still studying, not out of choice, but by necessity.

Heather sat cross-legged on the couch, poring over a book on exorcisms, her brows furrowed, lips moving slightly as she read, mouthing words that probably hadn’t been spoken out loud in centuries.

Mac was on the floor, elbow propped up on the coffee table, a beer balanced in one hand, flipping through an old Latin textbook with the same vague disinterest as a man reading the fine print on his own death warrant.

I leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching them, the faint scent of fresh coffee curling through the air from the half-full pot still warming on the burner.

We were cramming. We had been forced to take Latin in school, but I don’t think we’d ever found any use for it outside of class.

Most kids bitched about it, never saw the point, thought it was just another dead language they’d never use.

But most kids hadn’t witnessed a cult perform a ritual in that dead language deep in the woods, kneeling before a stone owl with human bones scattered at its base.

Most kids hadn’t heard demons whisper in the dark.

Heather tapped the page in front of her, chewing on the inside of her cheek, eyes flicking toward me.

“How do you say protect me again?”

“Protege me.”

Mac groaned. “I thought we were done with this shit after junior year.”

Heather ignored him, flipping a page. “And I command thee?”

“Praecipio tibi.”

Mac tossed his book onto the table with a thud, rubbing a hand over his face.

“Yeah, well, I command thee to bring me another beer, because this is giving me a headache.”

Heather rolled her eyes. “I’d rather command a demon to drag you to hell.”

Mac grinned. “You wouldn’t last a day without me, sweetheart.”

Heather responded with her middle finger.

I sighed, grabbing a beer from the fridge and tossing it at Mac’s head.

He caught it without looking up. He had been flipping through my father’s bible, his eyes locked on a particularly disturbing image within the margins, a monstrously horned demon, wrapped in golden chains and trapped within a circle. Behind him was the figure of a man, burning into golden ashes.

“What’s the story behind this one?” Mac asked curiously, taking a swig of his cold beer.

I glanced over at the drawing, my eyes scanning the Latin inscription.

”Apparently that’s a particularly hardcore exorcism, reserved for powerful threats. It casts out the demon, but it requires a willing human sacrifice.” I said, translating as I read from the page.

Mac’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline.

“Yeah, uhm… I’d rather just stick with the holy water.” Mac said, shaking his head and taking another sip of his beer.

As if just remembering, he moved the Bible aside with newfound purpose, pulling out a rumpled piece of paper from underneath it. Mac handed me the newspaper. He didn’t toss it or shove it in my general direction, he handed it to me, his lips set in a thin, unimpressed line.

“Medical examiner ruled on Greg O’Neal.”

Heather glanced up. “Already?”

Mac leaned back against the couch. “Yeah, and you’re not gonna believe it.”

I unfolded the paper, my eyes skimming over the bold, black headline stretched across the front page.

LOCAL MAN FOUND DEAD IN HOME

CAUSE OF DEATH: HEART ATTACK, FOLLOWED BY PET CONSUMPTION

Heather leaned closer, scanning the article over my shoulder.

I read aloud.

“Greg O’Neal, 42, was found deceased in his home early Sunday morning after concerned neighbors reported a foul odor. Medical examiner Dr. Yasin Halak has officially ruled that O’Neal suffered a fatal heart attack in his residence. His pet dog, left without food or water for several days, reportedly consumed much of O’Neal’s lower torso, as well as his head and skull.”

I stopped reading.

Mac let out a low, skeptical whistle.

Heather made a noise in the back of her throat, somewhere between a laugh and a horrified choke.

Mac tilted his beer toward the ceiling.

“Pour one out for the dumbest fucking explanation I’ve ever heard.”


I read the rest in silence, my fingers tightening around the edge of the paper, my breath suddenly too loud, my heartbeat pressing hard against my ribs. Greg’s wounds weren’t consistent with a dog attack. They were consistent with something else, something I had read about. I moved quickly, flipping through one of the old texts on the table, Heather’s breath hitching as I shoved aside the exorcism book to make room.

“What?” she asked, watching me.

I didn’t answer, not yet. I was already skimming pages, scanning paragraphs, searching, searching, searching—and then—I found it.

My chest tightened. Heather’s hand brushed my arm gently, reassuringly, but I barely registered it, my eyes locked on the page, my pulse hammering beneath my skin.

“Corpus laceratum. Carnem devoratum. Os fractum…”

Mac raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, cool, spooky demon words. Mind explaining that in English?”

I swallowed hard.

“It means—”

I looked up, finally meeting Heather’s eyes.

“The body was shredded. The flesh was consumed. The bones were crushed.”

Heather’s face drained of color.

Mac blinked. “Okay. And?”

I tapped the passage, jaw tight.

“This is how they kill people. This is what those demons leave behind.”

Heather’s breath hitched. Mac sat up straighter. The weight of what I was saying—what it meant—settled into the room like a lead blanket. Heather swallowed hard, shifting uncomfortably, her fingers curling into the fabric of her jeans.

“So,” she said, voice unsteady. “So, what? You’re saying that thing in my room, the one that…”

Her gaze flickered down her arms to the bandages. 

To the long, jagged gashes beneath them.

She inhaled sharply.

“That thing could’ve done a lot worse?”

I didn’t say anything, I didn’t have to. The answer was clear as day, sitting between us in the pages of an ancient, leather-bound book.

Mac let out a slow breath. “Shit.”

Heather pressed her hands into her knees, as if grounding herself, her lips pressing together into a thin, bloodless line. Silence stretched around us, encompassing the dimly lit room.

Heather shook her head, her expression tight, unreadable. I could tell she was trying to make sense of it. This was a creature that had sunk its claws into her, that had cut into her skin and let her live, like it was playing with its food, toying with her. It could have ripped her apart like it did Greg O’Neal, but it didn’t.

Heather exhaled slowly, dragging a hand through her hair.

“I need a drink.”

Mac raised his beer. “Amen.”

Heather didn’t laugh.

Neither did I.

Because deep down, we knew—we were running out of time.




The house was warm.

The kind of warmth that settled in slow and steady, creeping in through low voices, flickering candlelight, the hum of pages turning, the soft scrape of pen against paper.

Heather was curled up in the chair across from me, one leg folded beneath her, a blanket draped loosely over her shoulders. She had stopped flipping through her book twenty minutes ago, her fingers resting against the open pages, eyes half-lidded as the weight of exhaustion pulled at her limbs, at her breath, at her pulse.

Mac was on the floor, leaning back against the couch, a book resting on his stomach, turning it over absently in his hands, his fingers smudged orange from the last of his cheese puffs, his head tilted back, eyes closed, breathing even.

Outside, the night was still. The world wasn’t ending, at least not yet anyway.

I took a slow sip of coffee, savoring the rich, bitter taste, the warmth spreading through my chest, settling into my ribs, filling the spaces that had been hollowed out by weeks of dread, of death, of secrets too big to name.

For a moment, just a moment—it almost felt like we were okay.


Then Heather fell asleep and the screaming started.


It began as a whisper.

A faint, distant sound, barely audible over the steady crackling of the fireplace.

Then it grew into a shriek, a wail, a piercing, unholy cacophony, tearing through the night, rattling through the windows, growing louder, faster, closer. Mac’s eyes flew open. Heather gasped, body jerking as if something had reached out and yanked her from the depths of sleep.

Mac shot up. “What the fuck—”

I slammed my book shut, shoving to my feet.

“They followed her,” I said, my voice steady.

The house shook. The walls trembled, the floorboards creaking, the air growing thick and oppressive, the scent of burning sulfur curling beneath my nose, sinking into my lungs. I moved quickly, grabbing the book from the table, tearing through the pages, searching, scanning, finding what we had prepared, what we had studied, what we had been waiting for.

Mac swore under his breath.

“What do we do?”

I gripped the cross from the mantle, pressing it into Heather’s limp hand, wrapping her fingers around it, holding them in place, then I turned to Mac.

“Go to the truck. Fill a jug.”

Mac didn’t hesitate, he didn’t argue.
  
He was out the door in seconds, sprinting into the dark. Heather’s body lifted from the chair, her arms limp, her hair falling in wild tangles around her face, her pulse a distant, dying thing beneath my fingers. The house groaned, the walls stretching like something was pressing against them from the inside, trying to force its way through.

Mac came crashing through the front door, the jug sloshing wildly in his grip.

“Got it.”

“Good.”

Heather screamed.

Her body snapped upward, arms flung wide, suspended in midair, like invisible strings had yanked her from the ground, her back arching, her mouth falling open in a silent wail, her fingers twitching violently, spasming, shaking, twisting into unnatural shapes.

I grabbed my father’s bible, my voice steady, unwavering, loud.

“In nomine Jesu, ad te veniamus, tuam divinam protectionem quaerentes!”

Heather convulsed, her head snapping back, her throat exposed, her lips parted as if gasping for air that would never reach her lungs. Mac grabbed her ankle, trying to pull her back down, but something stronger held her in place. The house groaned, the walls stretching like something was pressing against them from the inside, trying to force its way through.

The shadows moved, the air hissed.

Heather’s body jerked violently, her breath ragged, choked, her arms stretching outward, her ribs heaving, her body pulling in two different directions, as if unseen hands were gripping her from both sides, preparing to—

“Mac!”

Mac lifted the jug aloft, sloshing holy water all over his hands.

“Now!”

The moment the first drop hit Heather’s skin, she convulsed, her mouth falling open in a silent scream, her limbs spasming, the house shuddering beneath our feet.

I lifted my cross.

“Abrenuntiamus omnibus spiritibus immundis et eiecimus eos sicut fecistis filio Matutino!”

The air rippled, the walls bulged outward, the lights flickered, then died.

Heather’s back arched, her breath ragged, shallow, gasping.

“Adjuramus te, cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque æternæ perditionis venenum propinare!”

A deep, guttural hiss slithered through the room, folding into itself, shifting into laughter, into sobs, into something ancient and mocking.

Mac gritted his teeth. “Come on, come on—”

“Circumda nos lumine sancto tuo et pace tua reple nos! Tecti sumus sanguine Christi, et nullae contra nos tenebrae praevalere possunt!”

I kept reading, voice growing louder, stronger, words rolling from my tongue like fire, like a blade, like the will of something greater than myself.

“In nomine Dei, impero tibi! Exi!”

Heather’s body seized, convulsed, snapped forward—the shadows dissipating.

And then it was just us.

I lurched forward, just barely managing to catch Heather before she’d have hit the floor, the house falling still, no shadows, no whispers, no breathing but our own.

Mac was panting, his hands still dripping with holy water, his shirt damp with sweat, his eyes wide. Heather lay motionless in my arms, her chest rising and falling in slow, even breaths, her fingers still loosely curled around the cross.

I wiped a hand down my face, exhaling slowly, willing my hands to stop shaking, letting the weight of what we had done settle into my chest.

Heather was weightless in my arms. Not just in the way she physically felt, but in the way her body curled against me, soft and pliant and light, her breath a quiet whisper against my collarbone, her fingers loosely curled against my chest.

I carried her down the hall, moving slowly, deliberately, like I was holding a precious piece of Kintsugi pottery, fragile, too important to be rushed.

The bedroom was dark, the bed unmade, the sheets soft and cool beneath my hands as I lowered her onto the mattress, letting the blankets swallow her whole. She was the deepest kind of asleep, the kind that couldn’t be touched by nightmares, by memories, by anything at all.

I stood there for a long moment, looking down at her, taking in the curve of her cheek against the pillow, the way her lashes flickered just slightly with each breath, the slow, steady rise and fall of her chest.

Carefully, gently, deliberately, I reached down and tucked the blankets around her.

Pulled them up over her shoulders, over the bruises on her wrists, over the places where she had been hurt. The weight of them settled over her like a shield, like a barrier against whatever might come next, against whatever was still waiting in the dark.

I brushed her hair back from her face, fingertips barely grazing her skin, just enough to push the loose strands away from her eyes. She exhaled softly, didn’t wake, didn’t even stir. For the first time in weeks, she looked at peace.

Mac was waiting in the doorway. He didn’t say anything, didn’t make a joke, didn’t smirk, didn’t point out the way I had been standing there too long, looking at her too long.

He just leaned against the frame, arms crossed, watching me. I swallowed hard, glancing back at Heather one last time before finally turning, exhaling slow and steady.

I glanced at the clock.

3:47 AM.

“You wanna get a drink?”

Mac barked out a tired, humorless laugh.

“Yeah.”

I grabbed my jacket.



MAC PETERSON

The bar was dimly lit, the kind of place that hadn’t changed in twenty years—wooden stools worn smooth by time, walls stained with nicotine, the air thick with the scent of spilled whiskey and lost wages. The jukebox in the corner hummed with the low twang of old country music, playing to a crowd too far gone to listen.

It was late enough that the crowd had thinned, the usual drunks slumped over their tables, nursing warm drinks, eyes glassy and far away. A neon sign buzzed softly in the window, flickering every few seconds, casting uneven light across the linoleum floor.

It was the kind of place you came to forget.

Which made sense, because Jeremiah Wright had been trying to forget for a long, long time.

He was sitting at the bar, hunched over a glass of whiskey, fingers wrapped tight around it, like if he let go, the whole thing might fall apart.

I almost didn’t recognize him at first.

Jeremiah Wright, Morgan’s dad.

He was hunched over at the bar, a bottle of something brown and mean sitting in front of him, his fingers wrapped so tight around his glass I thought it might shatter. His shoulders, broad and heavy, seemed smaller than I remembered, his once-strong posture caved in, folded inward like a man trying to make himself disappear.

He used to be sharp.

I remembered him at twelve years old, standing on his porch, telling Morgan and me to be home before dark. He always spoke like a man who knew things, like a man who could smell bullshit before it was even shoveled. He was a journalist, the real kind, the kind that asked questions and expected answers, the kind that dug until his hands were bloody and his throat was raw from shouting the truth into deaf ears.

But that was before, before the funeral, before he buried his only daughter.

The last time I saw him, he had been a different man—tall, broad, always carrying himself like a guy who knew the world was against him but refused to let it break him.

Now, he looked small. Not physically—he was still built like a goddamn freight train—but the weight in his shoulders, the dullness in his eyes, the way he carried himself like something that had already been crushed and was just waiting for the rest to cave in?

That was new.

That was the weapon that only grief could wield. I took a deep breath, glanced at Alan, then walked over.

Jeremiah didn’t look up when I sat beside him, didn’t flinch when Alan sat on the other side, didn’t acknowledge us at all, except for the way his fingers tightened around his glass, just a little. We sat in silence for a moment, the weight of it thick between us, pressing against my ribs, filling the spaces where words should be.

I spoke first.

“How you been, Jeremiah?”

His jaw clenched.

“Been better.”

His voice was rough, worn down by cigarettes and whiskey and too many nights without sleep.

I nodded, staring at the bottles lined up behind the bar. “Yeah. I bet.”

Alan leaned forward, resting his forearms on the counter.

“You hear about what happened to Don and Kevin?” Alan’s voice was calm, level, but there was a weight behind it, something thick and unspoken.

A long pause.

Jeremiah exhaled through his nose.

“I heard.”

Something flickered in his expression, something quick and deep and awful, but it was gone before I could place it.

Alan didn’t miss a beat.

“You know anything?”

Jeremiah laughed, short and bitter, the sound like gravel in his throat.

“Yeah,” he muttered. “I know plenty.”

That caught me off guard.

I expected denial, deflection, a brush-off, not an admission. 

I leaned forward.

“Then… tell us.”

Jeremiah took a slow sip from his glass, set it down carefully, and shook his head.

“Go home, Mac.”

There was no anger in his voice, no bite. Just exhaustion.

The kind that settled deep into your bones, the kind that made a man stop fighting because there was nothing left to fight for. He turned and for the first time that night, he looked at me.

His eyes were bloodshot, rimmed with exhaustion, but there was something else behind them, too—something sharp, something heavy, something that had been buried so deep for so long that even mentioning it was enough to bring it clawing back to the surface.

“Go home, Mac.”

I shook my head.

“Jeremiah—”

“Go home.”

His voice was low, firm, final, the kind of tone that left no room for argument.

Alan tensed beside me.

“Jeremiah, we just—”

“I said go home.”

His words hit like a slammed door, sharp and unyielding, like a man who had nothing left to give, nothing left to say, nothing left at all.

But I wasn’t leaving, not yet.

I took a slow breath, steadying myself.

I swallowed, my throat tight.

“I… I miss her.”

His face twisted, something flickering behind his tired eyes, something raw and ruined and old.

“Don’t,” he murmured.

But I did, because someone had to.

“She wouldn’t want you to drink yourself into the grave.”

His fingers tightened around his glass, shoulders going stiff. I swallowed, my throat dry.

“She wouldn’t want you to pretend she never existed, either.”

That one hit.

I saw it in the way his shoulders sagged, in the way his hands curled into weak, shaking fists, in the way his breath hitched just slightly before he could smother it.

The words settled like dust in a house long abandoned, like something forgotten finally being remembered.

Then, finally—his eyes opened.

And he looked at me again.

Jeremiah sighed, long and slow, and reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out a set of truck keys.

“Come on,” he muttered.

Alan and I exchanged a glance.

Then we stood, following him out into the cold.

The pines stood tall and silent around us, stretching upward like ancient sentinels, their branches swaying with the kind of whispering movement that made you think they were listening.

Jeremiah’s truck was parked in the darkest corner of the lot, an old, rusted-out beast with chipped paint and a dented bumper, the kind of vehicle that had been through hell and back. It was tucked into the shadows, its headlights casting a pale yellow glow over the scattered pine needles and uneven ground.

He opened the driver’s side door and leaned in.

He came back with a shoebox and thrust it into my hands like a live grenade.

“Everything I have,” he muttered, his voice rough, tired, a note of finality to it. “Not that it ever did me any good.”

I hesitated, then pulled off the lid.

It was filled to the brim with newspapers, photos, and old, handwritten notes, scribbled in frantic, desperate cursive, detailing places, dates, names.

Some were old school pictures, others were grainy images of men in suits, shaking hands with figures I couldn’t quite make out.

I flipped through the newspaper clippings, eyes scanning the headlines.

GOVERNOR CLIFTON ANNOUNCES MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION INTO ASHWOOD, AR

LOCAL MIDDLE SCHOOL SHOOTING LEAVES SEVEN DEAD

NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY; SCIENTISTS SHOCKED

The articles blurred together, my fingers gripping the paper tighter, my breath slow and uneven.

Alan leaned over my shoulder, scanning the clippings, his brow furrowed.

“What is this?”

Jeremiah exhaled through his nose.

“The only truth that ever mattered.”

He leaned against the hood of his truck, the orange glow of his cigarette flaring in the dark, his face cast in long shadows by the headlights. Smoke curled from his lips as he exhaled, staring out into the blackness of the trees like he was looking at something a thousand miles away.

Alan stood beside me, flipping through the papers, scanning the clippings, his fingers tightening with every turn of a page. The night was still, heavy, the only sound the distant hum of cicadas and the soft rustle of wind through the pines.

I held the shoebox in my hands, its cardboard edges frayed, its contents pressing against my palms like a pulse.

Jeremiah didn’t speak at first, didn’t move.

Just stood there, silhouetted in the headlights, his breath curling in the cold, his fingers flexing at his sides like he was trying to ground himself.

Then Jeremiah finally spoke.

“I was working for the Arkansas Times when I first caught wind of it,” he said, his voice low, rough with exhaustion and cigarettes and something older, deeper, heavier than all of it.

I watched the glow of his cigarette as he took another drag.

“The governor had been ramping up fracking projects all across the state,” he continued, breathing slowly. “Said it was about jobs, progress, energy independence—same shit they always say.”

He paused.

“But it didn’t add up.”

Alan looked up from the papers.

“What do you mean?”

Jeremiah tapped ash from his cigarette, watching it drift to the dirt at his feet.

“The numbers. The profits. The scale of the projects. None of it lined up with what they were actually pulling from the ground. Oil prices were high, sure. But not that high. Not high enough to justify what he was spending, what he was hiding.”

He shook his head.

“I started digging. Asking questions. And then—”

He gestured to the shoebox.

“I found this.”

He pulled out an old photograph, holding it up to the light.

It was grainy, black and white, taken underground—men in hard hats standing beside some massive structure, cables twisting from the ceiling like metal veins.

Alan frowned.

“What the hell is this?”

Jeremiah’s jaw tightened.

“The real project. The fracking sites? The drilling? The expansion projects? It’s all bullshit.” He turned back toward us, eyes dark, gleaming with something not quite anger, not quite regret. “Oh, sure, there’s a little oil coming out of the ground. Enough to keep the investors happy, enough to make the operation look legitimate. But that’s not what’s down there.”

He shifted, rubbing his fingers over his face like he was trying to wipe away years of exhaustion.

“They built something beneath the mountains. A Hadron Collider, a particle accelerator. It smashes protons together at nearly the speed of light to study the fundamental nature of reality. Clifton’s started off small, but every time they ‘expanded operations,’ they weren’t looking for more oil. They were expanding that. Making it bigger. Giving it more and more power.”

I felt a slow, sinking feeling settle into my gut.

“What the hell were they doing with it?” I asked.

He flicked his cigarette into the dirt, crushing it beneath his boot.

“They built a communication system. A way to send and receive messages—not from satellites, not from radio waves—” He hesitated. “From another dimensional plane.”

Alan stiffened.

“Another plane,” he repeated.

Jeremiah nodded once.

“The fifth and sixth dimension.”

The words sent a chill down my spine, the kind that started at the base of your skull and slithered all the way down, wrapping tight around your ribs like a vice.

“They have a computer system down there,” Jeremiah said. “A machine that takes input from the scientists—their questions, their problems, their theories—and then…” He trailed off. “It answers.”

Alan frowned.

“Who answers?”

Jeremiah shook his head.

“No one knows. That’s the problem. Every question gets a response, but they don’t know where it’s coming from. Could be an intelligence from the other side. Could be something else.”

Alan rubbed a hand down his face.

“And what do they ask it?”

Jeremiah’s expression darkened.

“The kind of questions that make people rich,” Jeremiah said. “And they got answers. About science, about medicine, about technology. It revolutionized the tech and pharmaceutical industry. Far more valuable than anything they could have pulled from the ground.”

He turned, resting both hands on the truck, exhaling like the weight of it was pressing down on his chest.

“That’s how the Phoenician Club was born. They built a monopoly on knowledge,” Jeremiah continued. “They controlled it. Decided who got what information, who could profit, who would be left behind.”

He shook his head.

“Governor Clifton has more power than the goddamn President.”

Jeremiah sighed.

“And they killed my daughter to keep it that way.”

The wind barely moved through the trees, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. The world felt still, too still, like the ground itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to give.

The shoebox sat on the hood of Jeremiah’s truck. The truth, tucked away in brittle newsprint and ink-stained pages, pages that should have seen the light of day years ago. My throat tightened. My hands curled into fists at my sides, fingernails digging into my palms, my pulse hammering behind my ribs.

“When Clifton found out I was writing the exposé, he sent me warnings. Told me to stop.”

Jeremiah’s voice was flat, empty, but there was something behind it, something barely held together, something teetering on the edge of collapse.

“I didn’t.”

He exhaled, his shoulders rising, then sagging.

“So they sent me a message.”

I felt something in my chest crack. Something deep and old and aching. Jeremiah turned, and for the first time that night, he looked right at me.

“They killed Morgan.”

The words hit like a bullet. Not like the one that took her from me, worse.

That one had been fast.

This one burrowed into my bones, splitting me open, filling every empty space with something I couldn’t name, something I didn’t have the words for, big and black and endless. The world tilted. I clenched my jaw, trying to breathe through it, but the weight of it was too much, too big, too awful.

They killed her.

Not by accident, not because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but because they wanted to turn her body into a message. Just because Clifton wanted Jeremiah to know how much power he really had.

Morgan had never mattered to them.

Not her laugh, not the way she could find a song in the sound of the rain, not the way she saw the world like it was still something worth loving, still something worth saving.

They had taken her and left nothing behind.

Just blood on a classroom floor.

Just a casket too small for all the life she had in her.

Just the empty, gaping space where her voice should still be.


I didn’t realize I was shaking until Alan touched my shoulder.

It was quick, just a brush of his fingers, but it was enough to bring me back to my body, back to the ground beneath my feet, back to the bitter taste in my mouth.

I forced a breath, tried to swallow it down like a prescription pill.

Tried to breathe through it.

Tried to make it make sense.

But it wouldn’t. It never would.

Jeremiah rubbed a hand over his face, his fingers trembling just slightly.

“They told me if I didn’t keep my mouth shut, my other kids were next.”

He turned toward me then, eyes wet, hollow, ancient with grief.

“So I kept my mouth shut.”

I swallowed, but it felt like shards of glass, cutting, burning, bleeding on the way down.

Alan’s voice was tight.

“And Greg O’Neal?”

Jeremiah nodded.

“He was my inside man. He drove equipment to the sites, saw things he wasn’t supposed to. When he was spotted talking to you—”

His gaze flicked to Alan.

“They killed him too.”

Alan’s jaw tightened.

We sat in silence.

The truth hung between us, thick, suffocating.

And for the first time in years, I saw something in Jeremiah’s face that wasn’t exhaustion.

It was relief.

Like a man who had been holding a secret too big for too long, and now that it was out, it didn’t belong to him anymore.

Alan closed the shoebox, setting it on the hood of the truck.

“What do we do now?”

Jeremiah took a deep breath.

“You do what I never had the guts to.”

He looked at both of us.

“You burn it all down.”



———————————————————


The overhead fluorescents buzzed in the stillness of the U.S. Marshals’ office. The air was thick with the scent of coffee and toner, the quiet hum of computers filling the space between the occasional rustle of paperwork.  

Near the center of the room, two officers stood close, speaking in hushed voices.  

""Tip came in this morning,"" one said, arms crossed.  

""From who?"" the other asked.  

""The Governor himself."" A pause. ""It’s bad, child exploitative material. They’ve got a tape.""  

The second officer exhaled sharply, shaking their head.  

Across the office, a printer whirred to life. The machine’s steady hum filled the room, followed by the mechanical click of rollers pulling in a blank sheet. The first poster slid out, crisp and still warm, its bold black lettering stark against the white paper. 

WANTED.

Another followed. Then a third.  

The sheets collected in the output tray, edges curling slightly from the heat of fresh ink. A hand reached out, lifting the stack, thumb brushing against the thick paper as the posters were fanned out across the nearest desk. A coffee mug was pushed aside. A stapler clacked shut. The soft rip of tape being torn filled the space.  

In the background, a projector flickered on, casting faint light against the wall. A map appeared, red circles marking locations. Papers shifted. A chair creaked. Fingers tapped against a keyboard, quick and deliberate.  

No one spoke as the posters were lifted again, sorted into neat piles. The names printed below the mugshots stood out in dark ink:

MAC PETERSON

I had seen Alan carry a weapon before. The pocketknife when we were kids, the old pistol from his dad’s things after the funeral—he had always carried the weight of something meant to protect, to defend, to kill if necessary. But when I stepped into his house that night, seeing him standing there, shoulders tense, eyes shadowed, his crewneck henley pulled snug across his chest beneath the weight of a leather shoulder holster, I realized something had shifted.

This wasn’t just something he carried, it was something he had become. The gun wasn’t tucked away anymore, hidden at the small of his back or stuffed in a glovebox. It was on him, resting against his ribs like it had always been there, like it was part of his body now, a new limb, a new purpose.

The firelight flickered across his face as he turned the page of an old, thick book, one of several spread out across the coffee table, worn leather covers and yellowed pages scattered like relics from another life.
I kicked the door shut behind me.

“You gonna start preaching now, Reverend Alan?”

He didn’t look up. The room smelled like leather, paper, and the faintest trace of Alan’s cologne, something woody and sharp. His mother was gone again—out at someone else’s house, or a bar, or wherever it was she spent her nights. It didn’t matter. The house had always felt like his, not hers. But right now, it felt like something else entirely, filled with an uneasy reverence.

Alan’s fingers skimmed the page, his Tokarev shifting with the movement of his shoulders. The holster was new, stiff enough that I could tell it hadn’t been broken in yet, the leather creaking softly as he reached for another book. He finally spoke.

“We saw something ancient,” he murmured, almost to himself. “Older than this town. Older than America.”

I dropped onto the couch, stretching my legs out, picking up a book at random. The pages were fragile, delicate beneath my fingers, the writing dense and intricate, bleeding into the margins in fine, spidery script. The title on the spine read: Nephilim and the Fallen Hosts.

“Where the hell did you get these?”

Alan didn’t answer right away. Just turned a page, his mouth pressing into a thin line.

“The library.”

I raised an eyebrow. “They let you walk out with this?”

“Mrs. Reese always loved me,” he said. “You know that, Mac.”

I barked out a laugh, flipping through the pages. “So, you read a couple pages of biblical scripture and suddenly you’re a scholar?”

Alan ignored me.

I watched as he leaned forward, elbows braced on his knees, the book balanced in one hand, the other hovering just above the holster strap, like he had already trained his body to move toward it when necessary. His voice was quiet, measured, but there was something tightly coiled beneath it, something simmering just below the surface.

“What we saw in the woods wasn’t just a ritual.”

I frowned, shifting in my seat. “You’re gonna have to be more specific, man. We saw a lot of fucked-up things in the woods.”

Alan’s eyes flicked up, catching mine for the first time that night.

“It was a reenactment.”

A chill slid down my spine, cold and immediate. I didn’t have to ask what he meant. I had seen it, too, in the way the cult members moved, the way they bowed before the owl, the way their words sounded like they had been spoken a thousand times before. Not just a ceremony or a ritual, but a reenactment of something real, something that had happened before, long before we were there to see it.

Alan tapped a passage in one of the books, his jaw tightening.

“They weren’t just burning him as a symbol of Care,” he murmured. “They were offering him.”

My stomach twisted.

“An offering to who?”

Alan exhaled, closing the book softly, like the weight of the words had settled into his bones.

“To something older than humanity itself.”

I had never seen Alan look afraid.

Not even after the school shooting. Not even when we found out Kevin and Don were dead, laid out on the train tracks like garbage, their blood thick and dark and wrong. But now—sitting there, surrounded by old books and older truths, his gun snug against his ribs—

He looked afraid.

Not of the men in the robes or the stone owl or the cult that stretched its roots through our town like God running his fingers through the dust of creation. But of what they worshipped.

I leaned forward, arms braced on my knees.

“You think this thing is real?”

Alan’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. His fingers tapped against the book in front of him, once, twice, before flipping it open again. I followed his gaze to the passage, a list of names.

Some in Latin. Some in Phoenician, Hebrew, Greek. Some older than language itself.

He pointed at one.

Molok.

The god of sacrifice, the eater of children, the unblinking owl that never sleeps. In the renaissance painting printed onto the pages of the book, he was perched above the entrance to Hell, his master standing behind him, dark and terrible.

Belial, Abaddon, Apollyon, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, the Tempter, the Serpent, Old Scratch, many names for the same creature, spread across cultures and continents. On the page below me, Lucifer Morningstar stared directly up at me, a malevolent glint in his eyes.

A lump formed in my throat.

“This—” My voice cracked, just slightly. I swallowed hard and started again. “This is who they were praying to?”

Alan nodded. My chest felt tight, something cold pressing into my ribs.

“I thought…” I hesitated, the words feeling too big for my mouth, too big for the room. “I thought demons weren’t supposed to be real.”

The silence stretched between us, heavy and drenched in the weight of something neither of us wanted to admit.

I shook my head, gripping the back of my neck. “What are we supposed to do with that?”

Alan leaned back against the couch, exhaling slowly, his fingers running over the strap of his holster, like he was reassuring himself it was still there.

“I don’t know.”

But I could see the answer forming behind his eyes, flickering there like a match waiting to be struck.

And I knew—he was going to find out.




HEATHER ROBINSON

The sky was a deep, bruised purple, the last stretch of night folding into the pale suggestion of dawn as I made my way to Alan’s house.

I had barely slept.

I had barely blinked.

The gashes across my wrists ached, dull and constant, wrapped in uneven, hurried bandages, the cheap gauze I’d found in the bathroom cabinet doing little to stop the slow, seeping burn beneath my skin.

Mac was sprawled across the couch, a half-eaten bag of cheese puffs in his lap, fingers stained orange, an old TV tray balanced on his knee, its surface cluttered with a half-drunk beer, a few stray crumbs, and what looked like a grease-stained fast food napkin.

Alan was at the coffee table, surrounded by stacks of books, pages open to rituals, sigils, forgotten prayers, his fingers skimming over the text as if he had already memorized them and was just waiting for the words to tell him something new.

Mac looked up first, mouth half-full, eyebrows raised.

“Hey, Alan,” he said, chewing lazily. “When was the last time you slept?”

Alan didn’t look up.

“I haven’t.”

And as if to prove a point, he reached for his coffee, taking a long sip from the steaming mug, slowly pacing the kitchen as he swallowed, the acrid smell of freshly brewed caffeine curling through the air like smoke.

I shrugged off my coat and hooked it onto the back of a chair, rolling up my sleeves to adjust the bandages across my arms.

“I wouldn’t recommend it.”

Alan’s head snapped up instantly, coffee forgotten. In two steps, he was in front of me, eyes flicking down to my wrists, the bandages stark against my skin. He reached for my hands, gently, hesitantly, like touching them too hard might make them worse.

“What the hell happened?”

I shook my head, trying for a half-hearted, dismissive shrug, but Alan wasn’t buying it. Mac’s head popped over the back of the couch, an orange-stained hand covering his mouth as he mumbled through a mouthful of food.

“You good?”

“I’m fine.”

Alan’s fingers ghosted over my bandages, his jaw tight, his auburn eyes storm-dark, unreadable.

“You didn’t—” He stopped. Swallowed. “Heather, did you—”

“No.” I cut him off before he could finish the thought, shaking my head quickly, firmly, so there wasn’t a single doubt left in the room.

“And it wasn’t Trevor either.”

That seemed to make Alan relax just a fraction. Only a fraction.

Mac tilted his head. “Then what—”

“I didn’t do this,” I said, voice quieter now. “They did.”

Alan’s face didn’t change, but his hands did.

His grip on my wrists tightened, just slightly, fingers tensing like he was about to snap a pencil in half.

“Tell me everything.”

So I told them all of it, the breathing in the dark, the shadows that had always stared at me from my closet as a child finally stepping forward, finally becoming something tangible. I told them about the pain, about the way the talons had carved into my skin, precise, slow, like they had all the time in the world, like they had been waiting for this moment, for this night, for my body to finally belong to them.

When I was done, the silence in the room was heavy, suffocating, sacred.

Mac had stopped eating. Completely.

Alan turned away, rubbing a hand down his face, exhaling slow, measured, before grabbing another book from the pile and flipping through it.

“Hmm.” He tapped a passage. “Holy water. We’ll need holy water.”

Mac blinked. “How does one make holy water?”

Alan turned another page. “You can get it from a church.”

Mac grinned, but it was tired, humorless. “That’s great and all, but unless I missed a grand opening, we don’t exactly have a Catholic church in town.”

Alan hummed thoughtfully. “Then we make it.”

Mac raised an eyebrow. “And how do we do that? You got some kind of priest license you haven’t told us about?”

Alan didn’t answer immediately, running his fingers down the page as he read, brows furrowing, lips pressing into a thin line.

He let out a slow breath, running his hands across his face.

“I’ll figure it out.”




MAC PETERSON

I always got the short end of the stick.

Alan and Heather got to stay in town, sip coffee, and whisper over ancient scripture like a couple of medieval scholars preparing for battle, while I got to take Alan’s rust-bucket of a truck on a four-hour drive to find a priest who would bless three stolen water coolers from the high school football team.

Perfect. Really.

It was exactly how I wanted to spend my day.


Alan’s truck rattled like it was held together by duct tape and pure spite, the kind of vehicle that shook when it went over forty miles an hour and smelled faintly of cigarettes, engine grease, and something I could only describe as boy.

I hadn’t been to the city before. Didn’t even know what the hell I was looking for, aside from a church, a priest, and enough patience not to commit a felony when someone inevitably pissed me off.

The drive was long, dark, and uneventful, the highway stretching on forever, the streetlights thinning out the further I got from town. The radio was mostly static, save for some old rock station playing the same ten songs on repeat, and I kept my window cracked just enough to keep me from dozing off.

The three massive water coolers sat strapped in the truck bed, sloshing slightly every time I hit a bump.
The whole thing was stupid. But then again, so was everything else that had happened to us lately. 

So I kept driving.


The city was alive in a way Ashwood never was.

Bright storefronts, traffic signals blinking neon-red through the damp streets, couples walking arm in arm, people moving like they had somewhere important to be. It was like stepping into another world.

For a second, I didn’t know where to start. So I parked outside the first church I saw—an old, brick-and-stone cathedral, the kind of place that looked like it had been standing since before America had a name.
I pulled Alan’s truck into the lot, turned off the engine, and sat there for a minute, drumming my fingers on the wheel.

And that’s when I saw them.

A couple holding hands. She was laughing, throwing her head back, golden hair catching in the streetlight, her fingers curling into the sleeve of his jacket, pulling him closer.

And for half a second, just half a second—I thought it was her. It wasn’t. Of course, it wasn’t.

Morgan was dead, had been dead for years, her body nothing but bones beneath the dirt. But the girl looked like her, enough to make my stomach twist, enough to make something inside me ache in a way I didn’t want to examine too closely.

The guy she was with leaned down, pressing a kiss to her temple, murmuring something that made her laugh, and for a second—

I saw us. Twelve years old again.

Sitting on the dock by the lake, her bare feet kicking at the water, her hand in mine, a teasing smile playing on her lips as she whispered, I think you’re my favorite person, you know that?

I swallowed hard, shoving the memory back down before it could take root.

Morgan was gone.

And I was here, sitting in a truck full of stolen tap water, trying to convince a priest to bless some Gatorade jugs so we could fight demons.

Perfect.

Just fucking perfect.

The inside of the church was warm, dimly lit, the scent of old wood and melted wax curling through the air.

I was Catholic, but I hadn’t stepped foot inside a church like this one since my grandmother’s funeral, and even then, I had spent the whole time staring at the stained glass windows, tracing the patterns with my eyes, avoiding the weight of the casket in front of me.

Now, standing at the front, I cleared my throat.

The priest looked up from a massive, leather-bound book, tilting his head slightly as he took in the vaguely suspicious teenager in front of him.

He gave me the look—the kind of look adults gave kids when they knew they were about to hear some kind of bullshit, but they hadn’t quite figured out how much yet, so I decided to rip the band-aid off.



The look he gave me was priceless.

“You want me to do what?”

There was a long, painful silence.

“…How much water?”

I hesitated.

“About fifteen gallons.”



It took forty minutes.

Forty long, awkward minutes of convincing the priest I wasn’t a complete lunatic, followed by an even longer period of watching him measure out herbs and salts, mixing them into the coolers, murmuring prayers over them as he worked.

I stood awkwardly by the truck, hands in my pockets, nodding along like I had any idea what the hell he was saying.

Eventually, it was done. He wiped his hands on his robe, eyeing me warily, like he was still deciding if I was some kind of cultist or just really, really Catholic.

“You’re sure you’re using this for—” He paused. “Appropriate reasons?”

“Yep.”

More silence.

A slow nod.

Then—

“Well. God be with you, then.”

I forced a smile. “Appreciate it.”

By the time I got back on the road, the sun was creeping up over the horizon, casting everything in a washed-out, golden light, like the world had been dipped in honey and dust. The drive felt longer on the way back, exhaustion settling into my bones, the steady slosh of the water coolers in the back serving as the only real reminder that this wasn’t just some insane fever dream.

By the time I pulled into Alan’s driveway, I was running on coffee fumes and sheer determination, my hands gripping the wheel a little too tightly, my thoughts a little too scattered. I threw the truck into park and climbed out, rolling my shoulders, stretching out the stiffness that had settled in during the drive.

Inside, Alan and Heather were exactly where I left them—curled up on the couch, a massive tome spread between them, heads bent low as they whispered over the text. Alan was barefoot, his shoulder holster slightly undone, the Tokarev nestled against his ribs, his coffee cup sitting half-finished on the table beside him.

Heather was close, her knee pressed against his, one hand holding the book open, the other tracing something in the margins, her brow furrowed, her lips pressed together in concentration. I stood in the doorway for a second, watching them, feeling an unfamiliar, uncomfortable pang in my chest that I couldn’t quite place.

Then—I cleared my throat.

Alan looked up first, expression unreadable.

I grinned.

“Congratulations. We’re officially the proud owners of fifteen gallons of home-brewed holy water.”

Heather huffed out a laugh, shaking her head.

Alan just nodded.

“Good,” he said, tone even, calm, like he hadn’t just asked me to drive eight fucking hours for this.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair.

“If that water doesn’t work,” I muttered, “I’m gonna kill you.”

Heather snorted.

Alan just turned the page.

ALAN RUSSELL

They found the bodies on Sunday.

I heard about it before I even saw the papers, before the whispers started rolling through town like a slow-moving sickness, twisting their way through the streets, through the diners, through the school hallways. News like that doesn’t spread. It seeps, like blood through fabric. By the time the sun had fully risen, everyone knew.

By noon, the story was already set in stone.

Kevin and Don, drunk or high or both, had wandered out to the train tracks in the dead of night, draped themselves in a tarp, and fallen into such a deep, careless sleep that they hadn’t woken up when a thousand-ton train came bearing down on them at sixty miles an hour.

By evening, their names were cautionary tales, spoken in hushed, disapproving tones.

By Monday morning, they were just another small-town tragedy, another set of parents left burying their sons, another gruesome accident that no one wanted to think too hard about.


The conductor had seen them first, lying just past the junction outside of town, a few miles down the old freight line where the rust crept up the rails and weeds poked through the gravel. The tarp covering them was blue, weathered by the elements, barely distinguishable from the ground in the dark.

At first, he thought it was debris, a bundle of junk left behind by drifters or careless hunters. But as he got closer, the shape became clearer, more deliberate—two forms beneath the fabric, motionless, long limbs sprawled awkwardly over the steel rails.

He hit the horn. They didn’t move.

He threw the brakes. The train didn’t stop.

It took nearly a mile for it to slow, for the screeching metal to finally drag to a halt, but by then, it was too late.

By then, the bodies had already been torn apart, scattered across the tracks in dark, wet ribbons, pieces flung into the grass, into the gravel, into the deep ditches lining the junction like open graves.

The crew searched the scene with grim, reluctant hands, collecting what was left of Kevin’s arms, Don’s ribs, fragments of skull and torn fabric, piecing them together like a grotesque puzzle. That’s when they noticed that the blood wasn’t red. It was thick and purple, clotted like syrup, far too viscous, soaking into the ground in sluggish, gelatinous pools.

Any doctor, any forensic pathologist, any damn coroner with half a brain could tell you what that meant.

By the time the steel wheels tore through the bodies, splitting flesh from bone, scattering viscera across the tracks, they had already been dead.

I wasn’t a doctor. Neither was Mac or Heather. None of us had the medical knowledge to stand in that morgue and tell them they were full of shit, to point at the viscous, purple blood pooling in the plastic bags and tell them that people don’t die like that.

The medical examiner—Dr. Yasin Halak, a man who had been working in Ashwood longer than I had been alive, longer than my mother had lived here—gave the official cause of death at noon.

The boys had gone hunting, as they often did, but this time, they had gotten reckless. They had gotten stoned off their asses on “the dreaded marijuana,” lost track of time, lost track of their minds, stumbled onto the train tracks, and, for some unfathomable reason, pulled a tarp over themselves and passed out cold, dead to the world.

So dead, apparently, that a roaring freight train had not been enough to stir them from their sleep.

So dead that they hadn’t moved when the engine bore down on them, hadn’t twitched when the horn blared, hadn’t so much as shifted when the wheels finally met flesh.

Halak stood at that podium, in front of the whole town, and said this with a straight face.

Like Don, who had spent half his life handling firearms, tracking animals, surviving in the woods, would’ve decided to just fall asleep on the goddamn train tracks after smoking a little weed.

Like Kevin, who had been the lightest lightweight I had ever known, who never got high when we went night spotting because he was too paranoid about making a mistake, would have just let it happen.

He said it like it was reasonable, like it made sense, like we were all supposed to just accept it and move on.

And the worst part?

Most people did.


Don’s mother stood stone-faced at the service, her grief too deep to bend into words, her bodies too hollowed out to hold onto anything but the weight of loss. Don’s brothers, Nathan, Oliver, and little Sam sat behind her, shaky-legged and confused. Oliver and Sam were young, too young to understand that Don wasn’t coming home, tugging Nathan’s sleeve, asking if they could go to the catering table—and Nathan was too young to look as old as he did, the lines of loss etching themselves deep into the twelve-year old’s youthful face. He looked more like Don every day.

Kevin’s father was hit the hardest. He stood for the entire service, eyes firmly locked on the coffin of the last member of his family, silent tears streaming down the practiced iron face of a United States Marine. It occurred to me that this was the first time I had ever seen him without a bottle in his hand, something he explained when he gave his eulogy.

“I-I could have been a better father. Coming back, I wasn’t ready, I turned to the bottle to… try to deal with it. Kevin-Kevin looked up to me like you wouldn’t believe, thought I was a hero, and I let him down. Everyday. Watching his little face fall was worse than anything I ever had to do over there. But I… didn’t change and I guess he tried to deal with it the only way he knew—the way I did. If… if that shit did that to my boy, I’m never touching a drop of it again, memories be damned.”

After he walked off the stage with the brisk steps of a broken soldier, they brought up a bunch of Kevin and Don’s old teachers and classmates. We sat in the church pews, listening to people who had never really known them talk about them like they had, feeling our teeth press into our tongues as we tried to hold back the things we really wanted to say.

That it wasn’t their fault.

That they hadn’t died like that.

The town had already cried for them, for the boys they thought they knew. For the cautionary tale they had turned them into.

Kevin and Don, the reckless, foolish kids who had thrown their lives away in a haze of smoke and bad decisions, who had been claimed by the same stupid vices that had claimed a hundred others before them.

They didn’t get to be the boys we knew. They didn’t get to be smart, or funny, or stupid in the way that made life fun instead of tragic.

They didn’t get to be people anymore.

They were just a story now, another cautionary tale, another lesson to scare the younger kids straight, a tragedy they could shake their heads at over coffee, muttering about how they had thrown their lives away over drugs and bad decisions.


We should have said something.

We should have stood up, right there in that church, and screamed the truth at the top of our lungs, that their bodies had been dumped there, left like garbage on the tracks to be found.

But we didn’t.

Mac’s hands hadn’t stopped shaking since the moment we’d walked in. Heather hadn’t looked up from her lap. I sat there, gripping Kevin’s old lighter so tightly it left an indent in my palm, staring at the polished caskets at the front of the room, knowing—no one was in them. Not really, not the way they had been. The pieces of them had been collected. Put back together as best they could be.

But the real Don, the real Kevin—they had been gone long before that train hit them. 

I sure as hell didn’t trust the police, not after what we had seen. I knew better than to walk into that station and ask questions, but I needed to know, now more than ever.

I had other leads, people who might have been willing to talk if they thought I was the only one listening.

Greg O’Neal had told me to wait for his call. I had been waiting ever since.

Now, with Kevin and Don buried beneath the dirt, I wasn’t waiting anymore.

That night, after the funeral, after the murmured condolences, after Mac had punched a hole in the wall of my garage and Heather had sobbed into my shoulder for hours, I grabbed my father’s gun and I went looking for answers.




HEATHER ROBINSON


Alan held me like he knew I might break.

Like if he let go, I would crumble to pieces, scatter at his feet like shattered glass, slip between the cracks in the floor and disappear completely. I pressed my face into his shoulder, breathing in the scent of wood smoke and old leather, my fingers clutching at the fabric of his jacket, digging in like I could hold myself together by holding onto him.

The grief didn’t come all at once.

It bled in slow, crawling waves, filling the spaces between my ribs, creeping up my throat, pooling behind my eyes. I didn’t cry at first—just stood there, trembling, silent, too hollowed out to process the depth of what I had lost.

And then it hit me, all at once, like a tidal wave crashing over a broken levy.

Kevin was gone.

Don was gone.

The weight of those words pressed down on me, crushed me, swallowed me whole.

I broke and Alan let me.

There were no more stupid inside jokes, no more late-night drives, no more drunken confessions whispered between cigarette drags, no more Don rolling his eyes and Kevin making some sarcastic quip to lighten the mood.

There was just this hole, this sickening, gaping wound that had opened inside my chest, something I could never fill again.

And it hurt.

God, it hurt.

I don’t know how long I cried, but Alan didn’t let go. He just stood there, holding me up, like he knew I couldn’t stand on my own anymore.



I left shortly after, still dizzy with grief, still raw, like my insides had been scraped out and left in the dirt beside their caskets.

The wind was cold as I walked, cutting through the thin fabric of my dress, stinging my skin. I kept my arms wrapped tightly around myself, head down, feet moving automatically over the familiar road that led toward home. The pavement stretched ahead of me in long, jagged cracks, veins splitting through the asphalt like the town itself was coming apart.

Then, a sound—the low, slow roll of tires creeping up beside me.

The glow of headlights crawled along the street, reaching for my shadow, stretching it long and thin against the ground.

I knew who it was before he spoke.

“Hey.”

Trevor’s voice was too casual, too normal, like he was greeting me in the school parking lot instead of pulling up beside me on the way home from my dead friends’ funeral.

I kept walking.

The truck slowed, keeping pace with me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked, genuinely confused, like he didn’t already know, like he hadn’t been somewhere else, anywhere else, instead of sitting next to me in that church pew.

My hands curled into fists.

A sharp, bitter laugh pushed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, clenched my jaw, forced myself to breathe. I turned my head just enough to see his face, to take in the way he tilted his head in mild confusion, unbothered, unaffected, like he had never known them, never known me.

Something inside me cracked.

And I realized, with startling, suffocating clarity—

I hated him.

I hated his detachment, his self-importance, the way he could so effortlessly pretend that nothing had changed. I hated the fact that he hadn’t been there, hadn’t thought to call, hadn’t thought to ask if I was okay until I was walking alone in the dark with grief bleeding out of me in short, sharp, arterial bursts.

I turned back.

Kept walking.

“Hey—Heather.” His voice tightened, just a little, that edge of frustration creeping in. “Come on, don’t be like that.”

His car sped up for a second, pulling ahead, then slowed again, the tires grinding against the pavement.

I didn’t look at him. Didn’t stop. Didn’t care how pissed he was. I just walked, straight to my house, straight inside and slammed the door shut behind me.

I didn’t turn on the lights.

Just peeled off my dress, kicked off my shoes, crawled under the covers, and stared at the ceiling. But something felt… off.

It was subtle at first, just a tickle at the back of my skull, something I couldn’t place.

The air in the room was too thick, too heavy, pressing down on my skin like a damp cloth. The silence was too deep, stretched tight like a wire, like it was just waiting to snap.

I turned onto my side.

Told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, grieving, paranoid.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.




I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not my own.

Not… human.

Something slow. Something measured. Something wet.

The air in my room was thick with it, damp and unnatural, each inhale slow, rattling, wet, like something sucking air through hollowed-out bone. The sound slithered over my skin, pressing into my ears, crawling down my throat like smoke, pooling in my lungs like a second presence, something inside me, something breathing with me.

I tried to move.

I couldn’t.

A weight pinned me down, crushing my chest into the mattress, pressing my arms into my sides, my muscles locked into place like I had been buried alive.

I could feel it.

Something was sitting on me, pinning me to the mattress, pressing my body down into the sheets with deliberate cruelty, allowing me just enough breath to stay awake, to keep struggling, to remain trapped in the moment where waking turned to nightmare and nightmare turned to something worse.

My skin crawled, the back of my neck prickling like when I was a child, when I used to lie awake at night, convinced something was waiting in the closet, beneath my bed, just out of sight.

I wasn’t wrong back then.

I wasn’t wrong now.

And if I looked, if I let my gaze slip toward the darkness pooling in the corners of my bedroom, toward the places where my childhood nightmares had always waited for me, if I dared to look too closely—

I would see the others, too.





The closet door was open.

I didn’t remember leaving it open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

But now, in the suffocating dark, it had cracked just enough to reveal the narrow stretch of empty floor, the space between my hanging clothes, the place where I used to imagine glowing eyes blinking back at me from the void.

Something moved inside.

It was not solid, not a figure, not a shape, but rather the absence of a shape, an unraveling of reality, thick and black as ink, shifting in the dim light, pulsing, the suggestion of a form flickering in and out of existence.

Then—

The tips of black, razor-sharp claws curled around the edge of the doorframe, sinking into the wood.

It was steadying itself.

It had been waiting for me to notice.

A horrible, slow shudder rippled through the dark, and then it leaned forward, just slightly, just enough to be sure I knew—

It was looking at me.

The air grew colder, pressing into my ears, my ribs, my throat. I could feel the sheets beneath me, feel the mattress at my back—

And then, I felt something shift below me, a gentle, almost playful movement.

A pressure pressing up into my spine. Something was beneath the bed.

I had been afraid of this, once—when I was four, five, six years old, lying awake at night, legs curled up so they wouldn’t dangle over the side, so nothing could grab me, yank me down, pull me under.

I wasn’t four years old anymore, but I had never been more convinced that if I set one foot on the floor, I would be dragged into something I wouldn’t return from.

The breathing was closer now, curling over the mattress from all directions, seeping from the floorboards, from the corners of the room, from the spaces where darkness stretched too deep, where it pooled in places it had no right to be.

The creaking started, slow and deliberate, my headboard shaking ever so slightly. 

I couldn’t see past the edge of my mattress, but I felt it moving, shifting its weight from one foot to the other, measured, careful, like it didn’t want to wake me up.

It was closer than the first one, too close.

The stench of smoke and rotting meat filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, sinking into my skin, curling against my tongue.

It moved again. It was not solid, not completely.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye, a shape unraveling, folding into itself, shifting like liquid shadow, like a cloud of black ink spilled across water, its outline flickering in and out of reality, its presence undeniable even when it disappeared completely.

It was watching me.

It was hovering over me.

I could feel it leaning in, face hovering inches from mine, breath curling hot and damp against my cheek.

The smell of blood was thick in the air.

Something in the closet shifted again, fingers tightening around the wood, the unseen weight on my chest growing heavier, heavier, heavier, the edges of my vision dimming.

And suddenly I was back in middle school.

Mr. Corbin had fallen in a twisted heap of broken limbs and fabric, like something that had been dropped rather than collapsed, his fingers still curled into the fabric of his slacks, his back arched unnaturally, as if the bullet had locked him into place.

I had stared at him, unable to reconcile the shape of his body with the shape of the man he had been, watching as the blood crawled between the tiles, as thick and slow and endless as the River Lethe.

I had squeezed my eyes shut then, trying to pretend it wasn’t real, trying to pretend I wasn’t seeing it, that if I stopped looking, it would stop existing.

It hadn’t worked then, it wouldn’t work now.

Because I could still see him, could still see the way his mouth had fallen open, lips twisted in a way that no longer belonged to him, his face empty, hollow, frozen in the moment when he realized he was about to die.

And something in the darkness—something woven from inky black smoke and elongated limbs—laughed.

The weight on my chest never lessened, but I could feel a new presence, a new shape pressing into the mattress at my back, something curling itself around my spine, winding through my ribs like ivy, seeping into the spaces where I had long since stopped believing anything holy remained.

Its fingers trailed lightly over the skin of my neck, feather-light, tender, almost affectionate.

And then—a sound above me, a slow, wet clicking.

I had always been afraid of this, the idea that something could perch on the headboard of my bed, looking down at me while I slept, curling its claws into the wood, waiting for me to wake up so I could see it.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t—

It was not solid, not fully formed, an unraveling thing, shifting between states, visible and not, present and not, real and not, a creature made of ink and shadow, pouring through my bed frame, coiling beneath my sheets, wrapping its tendrils around my wrists like bracelets made of bone.

Something sharp pressed into my wrists. A long, curved raven’s talon, curling against my pulse, tracing the delicate, vulnerable stretch of skin, where my veins rose close to the surface.

And then, with a slow, deliberate pressure, it sank into my wrists.

Pain erupted in twin streaks of fire, sharp and hot, sending a bolt of electricity up my arms, every nerve ending screaming at once. My vision blurred, my breath ripped from my lungs in a silent, shuddering gasp.

Something wet dripped down my arms. The thing above me pressed closer, whispering something I couldn’t understand, something too old and too heavy and too broken for human ears.

And then—I woke up.

Jerking violently, gasping for air, hands flying to my wrists, breath shattering in my throat as I ran my fingers over the skin that should have been smooth, should have been whole.

It wasn’t.

Two long, deep scratches ran the length of my wrists, carved into my flesh like a signature welling with blood.

The closet door was still open. The room was as still as a mausoleum.

And in the shadows where my nightmares had always lived—

Something breathed, waiting for me to sleep again.



ALAN RUSSELL

I found Greg O’Neal’s address the old-fashioned way—sifting through old phone books, talking to the right people, using my fake id to pay for a couple of drinks at Callahan’s, and finally, after piecing together information like a puzzle made of half-rotted scraps, I had an address.

It sat in a part of town that felt like it had been forgotten on purpose, a place where the paint peeled faster than people could afford to cover it up, where the sidewalks were cracked and buckling, where the streetlights burned too dim or not at all.

By the time I pulled up, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon, a pale slit of dull pink light barely strong enough to push through the lingering night.

I should have been the first one there, but I wasn’t.

Two Dodge Polaras sat parked in front of the house, their red and blue lights casting eerie pulses across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the strips of yellow crime scene tape that flapped lazily in the early morning breeze.

And the front door—the front door was wide open.

I killed the engine and slid out of my truck, pulling my jacket tighter around myself as I made my way up the cracked sidewalk, shoulders tense, jaw clenched, the Tokarev TT-33 resting like a quiet promise beneath the layers of fabric, the metal icy cold against my skin.

I really needed to buy a holster.

The air reeked of something sour, something rotten, a stench so thick it made the back of my throat tighten. I had smelled blood before, smelled bodies left too long in places they weren’t supposed to be, but this was something different. Something worse.

The stink curled into my nostrils, settled into my lungs, and as I stepped closer, I saw it. Just past the officers standing at the door, past the flickering glow of cheap overhead bulbs, just barely visible through the open doorway—a corpse, sitting upright.

Headless.

One of the officers swiveled around, turning towards me before I could get any closer.

“Crime scene’s closed.”

I pulled my hands from my jacket pockets, raising them in an easy, slow-moving gesture. “Didn’t know there was a crime scene, officer.”

His eyes narrowed. “Then why are you here?”

I let my expression stay neutral, ignoring the tight coil of unease winding its way up my spine.

“Friend of a friend told me Greg O’Neal lived here. Haven’t heard from him in a few days.”

The other officer—younger, thinner, the kind of guy who still looked nervous when he put on the badge in the morning—shifted uncomfortably before speaking.

“Yeah, well. You won’t be hearing from him now.”

I didn’t ask what’d happened, I didn’t have to. I had already seen enough.

But the first officer—the older one, built like a brick wall, with eyes that looked like they had seen a thousand things no man should ever see—decided I should hear it anyway.

“Neighbor called it in,” he said, voice gruff, tired, the tone of a man who had been awake too long and had seen too much. “Said the smell was leaking out onto the street. We get here, we knock, we get no answer. We step inside, and there he is. Melting into the goddamn couch.”

His lip curled slightly, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered disgust in his eyes, the thing he was trying to swallow down, bury, forget.

“The top half of him, anyway.”

I didn’t ask where the head was.

They didn’t know, or maybe they did, and they didn’t want to say it out loud. I had seen enough strange things to know that some wounds didn’t bleed the way they were supposed to, that some deaths weren’t meant to be neatly written down in a coroner’s report.

Something felt wrong about this, though. Not just the body, not just the missing head. The house itself was too quiet, not the kind of quiet that came from an empty building, but the kind of quiet that came from something waiting, something watching, something pressing against the walls just beneath the surface, curling its fingers into the floorboards, stretching through the drywall.

Something had happened here and whatever it was—it hadn’t left.

I was about to turn back when the dog came out.

The first thing I noticed was the blood.

It was matted into its fur, dried and crusted in dark, jagged streaks, caking the white of its paws, staining the gray of its snout. It snarled and thrashed, teeth bared, foam bubbling at the edges of its mouth, the leash wrapped tight around the wrist of one of the officers as he struggled to drag the animal toward the car.

“Son of a bitch hasn’t let anyone near him since we got here,” the younger officer muttered, keeping his distance.

“Wouldn’t either, if I’d been locked in here for days with a corpse.”

I watched as they forced the dog into the backseat of one of the Dodge Polaras, the metal door slamming shut behind it.

It kept snarling, snapping, eyes wild, like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to attack or run or rip the whole goddamn world apart.

Something about it didn’t sit right.

Dogs mourned, dogs starved, dogs howled and whimpered and shrank beneath the weight of grief and loneliness.

But this?

This dog was angry.

And for some reason, that scared me more than the body.

I had come looking for answers.

Instead, I had found a corpse with no head, a house that smelled like death, and a dog that had seen something no living being could understand.

I had nothing.

No leads. No direction. No next move.

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, turning back toward my truck, keeping my eyes on the cracked pavement as I walked, forcing myself not to look back at the house, not to let my mind pick apart the way the door still stood open, how the shadows inside seemed darker than they should have been, deeper than they should have been.

I climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life beneath my hands. I sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, staring at my own reflection in the windshield, watching the red and blue lights flicker over my skin.

I needed a holster, I needed a plan, and most of all—

I needed to know what the hell had happened to Greg O’Neal.


The night was thick with humidity, the air clinging to my skin like a second layer. Greg O’Neal’s house stood ahead, dark and hollow, abandoned in the wake of his murder. The yellow police tape still fluttered against the porch railing, curling at the edges, but no one was watching this place anymore.

I stepped over the tape, my boots hitting the wooden steps with a soft creak. The door was still open—just enough for me to slip inside. The stench hit me immediately, thick and rotten, the kind of smell that burrows into your sinuses and lingers. Death. Even after they’d taken the body, scrubbed the floors, it still sat heavy in the air.

I pulled the collar of my jacket up, breathing through my mouth as I moved through the small living room. The furniture was cheap and well-worn, a sagging couch pushed against the wall, a stained recliner in the corner. A coffee table sat between them, littered with old magazines, cigarette butts, and a ring of dried blood where something—someone—had sat.

I crouched down, examining the dried stain. Greg had been dead for days before they found him, his dog half-starved by the door. There were things here that didn’t add up, and I wasn’t leaving without answers.

I moved toward the back of the house, careful not to disturb anything. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, the hinges groaning as I pushed it open. The bed was unmade, sheets still tangled, like someone had been in a hurry. A dresser stood against the far wall, drawers hanging open, empty. Someone had been here before me.

I stepped closer, my eyes catching on something wedged between the dresser and the wall. A scrap of paper, folded and creased. I crouched, pulling it free, unfolding it with careful fingers. The ink was smudged, but I could still make out the words.

PETERSON COMP STA #12—01:30

A date was scrawled beneath it, a week before Greg was found dead. I stared at it for a long moment, my pulse thrumming in my ears. He had known something. He’d gone out there for a reason, and whatever he’d found had cost him his life.

My pulse jumped as I heard a noise, soft, barely there, but enough to send a prickle down my spine. I turned sharply, scanning the darkened doorway. The house settled around me, the wind whispering through the open front door. There was nothing, only my nerves. I exhaled slowly, tucking the paper into my pocket before moving back toward the living room. I needed to check the kitchen, see if Greg had left anything behind—notes, receipts, anything.

I barely made it two steps before something slammed into the side of my jaw.

Pain exploded through my skull, bright and searing. My vision blurred, my knees buckling as I staggered, catching myself against the wall. Another hit—this one harder. My head snapped to the side, stars bursting behind my eyes, my body giving out beneath me.

The floor rushed up to meet me.

Then there was nothing.


I woke up in a jail cell that smelled like sweat, old paper, and the sharp, metallic tang of dried blood—the kind you don’t notice at first, but lingers beneath the surface, clinging to the air, waiting to be acknowledged. I sat up on the edge of my cot, elbows resting on my knees, watching the bars in front of me with the kind of measured patience that only came when you knew no one was coming to help you.

The silence pressed against me, thick and unmoving, broken only by the steady ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands moving with the slow, mechanical certainty of something that had seen more men wait out long nights than I could ever count. I rubbed my jaw, feeling the faint bruise forming there, and exhaled through my nose.

Then came the footsteps, boots against linoleum, the shift of a belt, the soft jingle of keys tapping against metal. I just listened as they came closer, as they stopped just beyond the bars, as a familiar weight settled into the air like a hand pressing firm against the back of my neck.

I finally lifted my gaze. Wilkes was standing there, one hand on his belt, the other holding a paper cup, steam curling from its rim. The old man took a slow sip of coffee, then let out a long sigh, shaking his head. ""Hell of a mess you got yourself in.""
For a second, just a second, it felt like being twelve again.

Like I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, listening to him spin stories about Samson and his jawbone, about David and his sling, about all the times when God didn’t spare the sinners, when the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole, when fire rained from the sky and turned entire cities to dust.

The stories they never told in church, but that he was always eager to share, delighting in the details.

“You’re real lucky, though,” Wilkes said, taking a slow sip of coffee. “If it were anybody else, they might’ve decided to charge you with something a little more serious than a night in jail.”

I snorted, rolling my shoulders. “On what, trespassing?”

Wilkes hummed, shifting his head slightly. “Could’ve been breaking and entering. Maybe even attempted burglary, if they were feelin’ mean about it.”

I tilted my head slightly, glancing at the bars between us. ""You know I had to try and find out what happened.""

Something flickered in Wilkes’ face, but it was gone before I could name it. The sheriff sighed, a deep, weary sound, and leaned back in his chair, rubbing a hand over his face like a man who had spent too many nights awake, watching over something he couldn’t protect.

“You’re reckless, son,” Wilkes said finally, his voice lower now, not scolding, but something else. Something softer. “You run around this town kicking up dust, looking under rocks that oughta stay put, and one day, you’re gonna find something you wish you hadn’t.”

I raised one weary eyebrow. “You worried about me, Sheriff?”

Wilkes exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “Course I am.” He looked down at the desk, tapping one finger against the wood. “Watched you grow up. Watched all of you grow up. And now I’m sittin’ here, wonderin’ if I’m about to watch you throw yourself headfirst into something you can’t come back from.”

I looked down at the cracks in the concrete floor of the cell, thinking it over.

“You ever read Ezekiel 31, Sheriff?”

Wilkes' eyes flicked up, just for a second.

I took that as my answer.

""Talks about shepherds,"" I continued, my voice steady. ""The ones who do right, and the ones who don’t. How the Lord gets mighty pissed at the ones who fatten themselves on the flock, who trample the pasture, who leave the lambs scattered, hungry, lost.""

Wilkes exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. ""You always did have a memory for scripture.""

I smiled faintly. ""Got it from you, Sheriff.""

Wilkes sat there, watching me, unmoving, unreadable.

""My father was a carpenter,"" I said. ""Built everything we ever had with his own two hands. Didn’t have much growing up, but I had him. And he wasn’t perfect. But he worked, and he prayed, and he tried—tried his damnedest—to be a good man. A better man than his father was.""

I took a deep breath, pausing for a minute.

""I keep thinking about that, lately. About what it means to be good. About what it means to stand in the light of the Lord and walk in the path of the righteous man.""

Wilkes’ fingers stilled against the cup, his jaw tightening slightly.

""See, I used to think it was simple. I used to think there were good men and there were bad men, and all you had to do was be good."" I let out a breath, shaking my head slightly. ""But it ain’t that simple, is it? Nah, the world don’t work that way.""

Wilkes didn’t say a word. I looked at him then, really looked at him—the lines in his face deeper than he remembered, his shoulders not quite as squared as they used to be. I thought of all the years Wilkes had spent keeping this town in order, all the weight he carried.

""It’s hard to be good,"" I said. ""Hard to stand in a place like this and tell yourself you’re still walking the righteous path. Cain thought he could walk it. Abel did too. But the first story of man is the story of one man killing another. The first time blood ever touched the earth.""

Wilkes’ expression didn’t change, but something in his posture shifted, just slightly.
I leaned forward, resting my forearms on my knees.

""Every man’s got a choice,"" I murmured. ""To be the shepherd, or to be the sinner. To raise his hand, or to keep it by his side.""

I swallowed hard.

“And I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.”

Wilkes’s fingers tapped against his desk, slow, rhythmic, thoughtful. Then, finally, he spoke.

""I know you are,"" he said, voice steady. ""And that’s what worries me.""

Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. Then Wilkes let out a long breath, stood, and walked over to the cell. He pulled out the key, turned it in the lock with a soft, metallic click.

He stood, slowly and deliberately, walked on over, and unlocked the cell door.
“Mac paid your bail.”

He didn’t look at me as I stepped past him, moving toward the open door, toward the first breath of morning air spilling into the station.

But as I reached the threshold, the light cutting across my face, I heard Wilkes sigh quietly, almost resignedly. 

“Just go home, Alan.”

ALAN RUSSELL

They found the bodies on Sunday.

I heard about it before I even saw the papers, before the whispers started rolling through town like a slow-moving sickness, twisting their way through the streets, through the diners, through the school hallways. News like that doesn’t spread. It seeps, like blood through fabric. By the time the sun had fully risen, everyone knew.

By noon, the story was already set in stone.

Kevin and Don, drunk or high or both, had wandered out to the train tracks in the dead of night, draped themselves in a tarp, and fallen into such a deep, careless sleep that they hadn’t woken up when a thousand-ton train came bearing down on them at sixty miles an hour.

By evening, their names were cautionary tales, spoken in hushed, disapproving tones.

By Monday morning, they were just another small-town tragedy, another set of parents left burying their sons, another gruesome accident that no one wanted to think too hard about.


The conductor had seen them first, lying just past the junction outside of town, a few miles down the old freight line where the rust crept up the rails and weeds poked through the gravel. The tarp covering them was blue, weathered by the elements, barely distinguishable from the ground in the dark.

At first, he thought it was debris, a bundle of junk left behind by drifters or careless hunters. But as he got closer, the shape became clearer, more deliberate—two forms beneath the fabric, motionless, long limbs sprawled awkwardly over the steel rails.

He hit the horn. They didn’t move.

He threw the brakes. The train didn’t stop.

It took nearly a mile for it to slow, for the screeching metal to finally drag to a halt, but by then, it was too late.

By then, the bodies had already been torn apart, scattered across the tracks in dark, wet ribbons, pieces flung into the grass, into the gravel, into the deep ditches lining the junction like open graves.

The crew searched the scene with grim, reluctant hands, collecting what was left of Kevin’s arms, Don’s ribs, fragments of skull and torn fabric, piecing them together like a grotesque puzzle. That’s when they noticed that the blood wasn’t red. It was thick and purple, clotted like syrup, far too viscous, soaking into the ground in sluggish, gelatinous pools.

Any doctor, any forensic pathologist, any damn coroner with half a brain could tell you what that meant.

By the time the steel wheels tore through the bodies, splitting flesh from bone, scattering viscera across the tracks, they had already been dead.

I wasn’t a doctor. Neither was Mac or Heather. None of us had the medical knowledge to stand in that morgue and tell them they were full of shit, to point at the viscous, purple blood pooling in the plastic bags and tell them that people don’t die like that.

The medical examiner—Dr. Yasin Halak, a man who had been working in Ashwood longer than I had been alive, longer than my mother had lived here—gave the official cause of death at noon.

The boys had gone hunting, as they often did, but this time, they had gotten reckless. They had gotten stoned off their asses on “the dreaded marijuana,” lost track of time, lost track of their minds, stumbled onto the train tracks, and, for some unfathomable reason, pulled a tarp over themselves and passed out cold, dead to the world.

So dead, apparently, that a roaring freight train had not been enough to stir them from their sleep.

So dead that they hadn’t moved when the engine bore down on them, hadn’t twitched when the horn blared, hadn’t so much as shifted when the wheels finally met flesh.

Halak stood at that podium, in front of the whole town, and said this with a straight face.

Like Don, who had spent half his life handling firearms, tracking animals, surviving in the woods, would’ve decided to just fall asleep on the goddamn train tracks after smoking a little weed.

Like Kevin, who had been the lightest lightweight I had ever known, who never got high when we went night spotting because he was too paranoid about making a mistake, would have just let it happen.

He said it like it was reasonable, like it made sense, like we were all supposed to just accept it and move on.

And the worst part?

Most people did.


Don’s mother stood stone-faced at the service, her grief too deep to bend into words, her bodies too hollowed out to hold onto anything but the weight of loss. Don’s brothers, Nathan, Oliver, and little Sam sat behind her, shaky-legged and confused. Oliver and Sam were young, too young to understand that Don wasn’t coming home, tugging Nathan’s sleeve, asking if they could go to the catering table—and Nathan was too young to look as old as he did, the lines of loss etching themselves deep into the twelve-year old’s youthful face. He looked more like Don every day.

Kevin’s father was hit the hardest. He stood for the entire service, eyes firmly locked on the coffin of the last member of his family, silent tears streaming down the practiced iron face of a United States Marine. It occurred to me that this was the first time I had ever seen him without a bottle in his hand, something he explained when he gave his eulogy.

“I-I could have been a better father. Coming back, I wasn’t ready, I turned to the bottle to… try to deal with it. Kevin-Kevin looked up to me like you wouldn’t believe, thought I was a hero, and I let him down. Everyday. Watching his little face fall was worse than anything I ever had to do over there. But I… didn’t change and I guess he tried to deal with it the only way he knew—the way I did. If… if that shit did that to my boy, I’m never touching a drop of it again, memories be damned.”

After he walked off the stage with the brisk steps of a broken soldier, they brought up a bunch of Kevin and Don’s old teachers and classmates. We sat in the church pews, listening to people who had never really known them talk about them like they had, feeling our teeth press into our tongues as we tried to hold back the things we really wanted to say.

That it wasn’t their fault.

That they hadn’t died like that.

The town had already cried for them, for the boys they thought they knew. For the cautionary tale they had turned them into.

Kevin and Don, the reckless, foolish kids who had thrown their lives away in a haze of smoke and bad decisions, who had been claimed by the same stupid vices that had claimed a hundred others before them.

They didn’t get to be the boys we knew. They didn’t get to be smart, or funny, or stupid in the way that made life fun instead of tragic.

They didn’t get to be people anymore.

They were just a story now, another cautionary tale, another lesson to scare the younger kids straight, a tragedy they could shake their heads at over coffee, muttering about how they had thrown their lives away over drugs and bad decisions.


We should have said something.

We should have stood up, right there in that church, and screamed the truth at the top of our lungs, that their bodies had been dumped there, left like garbage on the tracks to be found.

But we didn’t.

Mac’s hands hadn’t stopped shaking since the moment we’d walked in. Heather hadn’t looked up from her lap. I sat there, gripping Kevin’s old lighter so tightly it left an indent in my palm, staring at the polished caskets at the front of the room, knowing—no one was in them. Not really, not the way they had been. The pieces of them had been collected. Put back together as best they could be.

But the real Don, the real Kevin—they had been gone long before that train hit them. 

I sure as hell didn’t trust the police, not after what we had seen. I knew better than to walk into that station and ask questions, but I needed to know, now more than ever.

I had other leads, people who might have been willing to talk if they thought I was the only one listening.

Greg O’Neal had told me to wait for his call. I had been waiting ever since.

Now, with Kevin and Don buried beneath the dirt, I wasn’t waiting anymore.

That night, after the funeral, after the murmured condolences, after Mac had punched a hole in the wall of my garage and Heather had sobbed into my shoulder for hours, I grabbed my father’s gun and I went looking for answers.




HEATHER ROBINSON


Alan held me like he knew I might break.

Like if he let go, I would crumble to pieces, scatter at his feet like shattered glass, slip between the cracks in the floor and disappear completely. I pressed my face into his shoulder, breathing in the scent of wood smoke and old leather, my fingers clutching at the fabric of his jacket, digging in like I could hold myself together by holding onto him.

The grief didn’t come all at once.

It bled in slow, crawling waves, filling the spaces between my ribs, creeping up my throat, pooling behind my eyes. I didn’t cry at first—just stood there, trembling, silent, too hollowed out to process the depth of what I had lost.

And then it hit me, all at once, like a tidal wave crashing over a broken levy.

Kevin was gone.

Don was gone.

The weight of those words pressed down on me, crushed me, swallowed me whole.

I broke and Alan let me.

There were no more stupid inside jokes, no more late-night drives, no more drunken confessions whispered between cigarette drags, no more Don rolling his eyes and Kevin making some sarcastic quip to lighten the mood.

There was just this hole, this sickening, gaping wound that had opened inside my chest, something I could never fill again.

And it hurt.

God, it hurt.

I don’t know how long I cried, but Alan didn’t let go. He just stood there, holding me up, like he knew I couldn’t stand on my own anymore.



I left shortly after, still dizzy with grief, still raw, like my insides had been scraped out and left in the dirt beside their caskets.

The wind was cold as I walked, cutting through the thin fabric of my dress, stinging my skin. I kept my arms wrapped tightly around myself, head down, feet moving automatically over the familiar road that led toward home. The pavement stretched ahead of me in long, jagged cracks, veins splitting through the asphalt like the town itself was coming apart.

Then, a sound—the low, slow roll of tires creeping up beside me.

The glow of headlights crawled along the street, reaching for my shadow, stretching it long and thin against the ground.

I knew who it was before he spoke.

“Hey.”

Trevor’s voice was too casual, too normal, like he was greeting me in the school parking lot instead of pulling up beside me on the way home from my dead friends’ funeral.

I kept walking.

The truck slowed, keeping pace with me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked, genuinely confused, like he didn’t already know, like he hadn’t been somewhere else, anywhere else, instead of sitting next to me in that church pew.

My hands curled into fists.

A sharp, bitter laugh pushed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, clenched my jaw, forced myself to breathe. I turned my head just enough to see his face, to take in the way he tilted his head in mild confusion, unbothered, unaffected, like he had never known them, never known me.

Something inside me cracked.

And I realized, with startling, suffocating clarity—

I hated him.

I hated his detachment, his self-importance, the way he could so effortlessly pretend that nothing had changed. I hated the fact that he hadn’t been there, hadn’t thought to call, hadn’t thought to ask if I was okay until I was walking alone in the dark with grief bleeding out of me in short, sharp, arterial bursts.

I turned back.

Kept walking.

“Hey—Heather.” His voice tightened, just a little, that edge of frustration creeping in. “Come on, don’t be like that.”

His car sped up for a second, pulling ahead, then slowed again, the tires grinding against the pavement.

I didn’t look at him. Didn’t stop. Didn’t care how pissed he was. I just walked, straight to my house, straight inside and slammed the door shut behind me.

I didn’t turn on the lights.

Just peeled off my dress, kicked off my shoes, crawled under the covers, and stared at the ceiling. But something felt… off.

It was subtle at first, just a tickle at the back of my skull, something I couldn’t place.

The air in the room was too thick, too heavy, pressing down on my skin like a damp cloth. The silence was too deep, stretched tight like a wire, like it was just waiting to snap.

I turned onto my side.

Told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, grieving, paranoid.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.




I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not my own.

Not… human.

Something slow. Something measured. Something wet.

The air in my room was thick with it, damp and unnatural, each inhale slow, rattling, wet, like something sucking air through hollowed-out bone. The sound slithered over my skin, pressing into my ears, crawling down my throat like smoke, pooling in my lungs like a second presence, something inside me, something breathing with me.

I tried to move.

I couldn’t.

A weight pinned me down, crushing my chest into the mattress, pressing my arms into my sides, my muscles locked into place like I had been buried alive.

I could feel it.

Something was sitting on me, pinning me to the mattress, pressing my body down into the sheets with deliberate cruelty, allowing me just enough breath to stay awake, to keep struggling, to remain trapped in the moment where waking turned to nightmare and nightmare turned to something worse.

My skin crawled, the back of my neck prickling like when I was a child, when I used to lie awake at night, convinced something was waiting in the closet, beneath my bed, just out of sight.

I wasn’t wrong back then.

I wasn’t wrong now.

And if I looked, if I let my gaze slip toward the darkness pooling in the corners of my bedroom, toward the places where my childhood nightmares had always waited for me, if I dared to look too closely—

I would see the others, too.





The closet door was open.

I didn’t remember leaving it open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

But now, in the suffocating dark, it had cracked just enough to reveal the narrow stretch of empty floor, the space between my hanging clothes, the place where I used to imagine glowing eyes blinking back at me from the void.

Something moved inside.

It was not solid, not a figure, not a shape, but rather the absence of a shape, an unraveling of reality, thick and black as ink, shifting in the dim light, pulsing, the suggestion of a form flickering in and out of existence.

Then—

The tips of black, razor-sharp claws curled around the edge of the doorframe, sinking into the wood.

It was steadying itself.

It had been waiting for me to notice.

A horrible, slow shudder rippled through the dark, and then it leaned forward, just slightly, just enough to be sure I knew—

It was looking at me.

The air grew colder, pressing into my ears, my ribs, my throat. I could feel the sheets beneath me, feel the mattress at my back—

And then, I felt something shift below me, a gentle, almost playful movement.

A pressure pressing up into my spine. Something was beneath the bed.

I had been afraid of this, once—when I was four, five, six years old, lying awake at night, legs curled up so they wouldn’t dangle over the side, so nothing could grab me, yank me down, pull me under.

I wasn’t four years old anymore, but I had never been more convinced that if I set one foot on the floor, I would be dragged into something I wouldn’t return from.

The breathing was closer now, curling over the mattress from all directions, seeping from the floorboards, from the corners of the room, from the spaces where darkness stretched too deep, where it pooled in places it had no right to be.

The creaking started, slow and deliberate, my headboard shaking ever so slightly. 

I couldn’t see past the edge of my mattress, but I felt it moving, shifting its weight from one foot to the other, measured, careful, like it didn’t want to wake me up.

It was closer than the first one, too close.

The stench of smoke and rotting meat filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, sinking into my skin, curling against my tongue.

It moved again. It was not solid, not completely.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye, a shape unraveling, folding into itself, shifting like liquid shadow, like a cloud of black ink spilled across water, its outline flickering in and out of reality, its presence undeniable even when it disappeared completely.

It was watching me.

It was hovering over me.

I could feel it leaning in, face hovering inches from mine, breath curling hot and damp against my cheek.

The smell of blood was thick in the air.

Something in the closet shifted again, fingers tightening around the wood, the unseen weight on my chest growing heavier, heavier, heavier, the edges of my vision dimming.

And suddenly I was back in middle school.

Mr. Corbin had fallen in a twisted heap of broken limbs and fabric, like something that had been dropped rather than collapsed, his fingers still curled into the fabric of his slacks, his back arched unnaturally, as if the bullet had locked him into place.

I had stared at him, unable to reconcile the shape of his body with the shape of the man he had been, watching as the blood crawled between the tiles, as thick and slow and endless as the River Lethe.

I had squeezed my eyes shut then, trying to pretend it wasn’t real, trying to pretend I wasn’t seeing it, that if I stopped looking, it would stop existing.

It hadn’t worked then, it wouldn’t work now.

Because I could still see him, could still see the way his mouth had fallen open, lips twisted in a way that no longer belonged to him, his face empty, hollow, frozen in the moment when he realized he was about to die.

And something in the darkness—something woven from inky black smoke and elongated limbs—laughed.

The weight on my chest never lessened, but I could feel a new presence, a new shape pressing into the mattress at my back, something curling itself around my spine, winding through my ribs like ivy, seeping into the spaces where I had long since stopped believing anything holy remained.

Its fingers trailed lightly over the skin of my neck, feather-light, tender, almost affectionate.

And then—a sound above me, a slow, wet clicking.

I had always been afraid of this, the idea that something could perch on the headboard of my bed, looking down at me while I slept, curling its claws into the wood, waiting for me to wake up so I could see it.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t—

It was not solid, not fully formed, an unraveling thing, shifting between states, visible and not, present and not, real and not, a creature made of ink and shadow, pouring through my bed frame, coiling beneath my sheets, wrapping its tendrils around my wrists like bracelets made of bone.

Something sharp pressed into my wrists. A long, curved raven’s talon, curling against my pulse, tracing the delicate, vulnerable stretch of skin, where my veins rose close to the surface.

And then, with a slow, deliberate pressure, it sank into my wrists.

Pain erupted in twin streaks of fire, sharp and hot, sending a bolt of electricity up my arms, every nerve ending screaming at once. My vision blurred, my breath ripped from my lungs in a silent, shuddering gasp.

Something wet dripped down my arms. The thing above me pressed closer, whispering something I couldn’t understand, something too old and too heavy and too broken for human ears.

And then—I woke up.

Jerking violently, gasping for air, hands flying to my wrists, breath shattering in my throat as I ran my fingers over the skin that should have been smooth, should have been whole.

It wasn’t.

Two long, deep scratches ran the length of my wrists, carved into my flesh like a signature welling with blood.

The closet door was still open. The room was as still as a mausoleum.

And in the shadows where my nightmares had always lived—

Something breathed, waiting for me to sleep again.



ALAN RUSSELL

I found Greg O’Neal’s address the old-fashioned way—sifting through old phone books, talking to the right people, using my fake id to pay for a couple of drinks at Callahan’s, and finally, after piecing together information like a puzzle made of half-rotted scraps, I had an address.

It sat in a part of town that felt like it had been forgotten on purpose, a place where the paint peeled faster than people could afford to cover it up, where the sidewalks were cracked and buckling, where the streetlights burned too dim or not at all.

By the time I pulled up, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon, a pale slit of dull pink light barely strong enough to push through the lingering night.

I should have been the first one there, but I wasn’t.

Two Dodge Polaras sat parked in front of the house, their red and blue lights casting eerie pulses across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the strips of yellow crime scene tape that flapped lazily in the early morning breeze.

And the front door—the front door was wide open.

I killed the engine and slid out of my truck, pulling my jacket tighter around myself as I made my way up the cracked sidewalk, shoulders tense, jaw clenched, the Tokarev TT-33 resting like a quiet promise beneath the layers of fabric, the metal icy cold against my skin.

I really needed to buy a holster.

The air reeked of something sour, something rotten, a stench so thick it made the back of my throat tighten. I had smelled blood before, smelled bodies left too long in places they weren’t supposed to be, but this was something different. Something worse.

The stink curled into my nostrils, settled into my lungs, and as I stepped closer, I saw it. Just past the officers standing at the door, past the flickering glow of cheap overhead bulbs, just barely visible through the open doorway—a corpse, sitting upright.

Headless.

One of the officers swiveled around, turning towards me before I could get any closer.

“Crime scene’s closed.”

I pulled my hands from my jacket pockets, raising them in an easy, slow-moving gesture. “Didn’t know there was a crime scene, officer.”

His eyes narrowed. “Then why are you here?”

I let my expression stay neutral, ignoring the tight coil of unease winding its way up my spine.

“Friend of a friend told me Greg O’Neal lived here. Haven’t heard from him in a few days.”

The other officer—younger, thinner, the kind of guy who still looked nervous when he put on the badge in the morning—shifted uncomfortably before speaking.

“Yeah, well. You won’t be hearing from him now.”

I didn’t ask what’d happened, I didn’t have to. I had already seen enough.

But the first officer—the older one, built like a brick wall, with eyes that looked like they had seen a thousand things no man should ever see—decided I should hear it anyway.

“Neighbor called it in,” he said, voice gruff, tired, the tone of a man who had been awake too long and had seen too much. “Said the smell was leaking out onto the street. We get here, we knock, we get no answer. We step inside, and there he is. Melting into the goddamn couch.”

His lip curled slightly, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered disgust in his eyes, the thing he was trying to swallow down, bury, forget.

“The top half of him, anyway.”

I didn’t ask where the head was.

They didn’t know, or maybe they did, and they didn’t want to say it out loud. I had seen enough strange things to know that some wounds didn’t bleed the way they were supposed to, that some deaths weren’t meant to be neatly written down in a coroner’s report.

Something felt wrong about this, though. Not just the body, not just the missing head. The house itself was too quiet, not the kind of quiet that came from an empty building, but the kind of quiet that came from something waiting, something watching, something pressing against the walls just beneath the surface, curling its fingers into the floorboards, stretching through the drywall.

Something had happened here and whatever it was—it hadn’t left.

I was about to turn back when the dog came out.

The first thing I noticed was the blood.

It was matted into its fur, dried and crusted in dark, jagged streaks, caking the white of its paws, staining the gray of its snout. It snarled and thrashed, teeth bared, foam bubbling at the edges of its mouth, the leash wrapped tight around the wrist of one of the officers as he struggled to drag the animal toward the car.

“Son of a bitch hasn’t let anyone near him since we got here,” the younger officer muttered, keeping his distance.

“Wouldn’t either, if I’d been locked in here for days with a corpse.”

I watched as they forced the dog into the backseat of one of the Dodge Polaras, the metal door slamming shut behind it.

It kept snarling, snapping, eyes wild, like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to attack or run or rip the whole goddamn world apart.

Something about it didn’t sit right.

Dogs mourned, dogs starved, dogs howled and whimpered and shrank beneath the weight of grief and loneliness.

But this?

This dog was angry.

And for some reason, that scared me more than the body.

I had come looking for answers.

Instead, I had found a corpse with no head, a house that smelled like death, and a dog that had seen something no living being could understand.

I had nothing.

No leads. No direction. No next move.

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, turning back toward my truck, keeping my eyes on the cracked pavement as I walked, forcing myself not to look back at the house, not to let my mind pick apart the way the door still stood open, how the shadows inside seemed darker than they should have been, deeper than they should have been.

I climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life beneath my hands. I sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, staring at my own reflection in the windshield, watching the red and blue lights flicker over my skin.

I needed a holster, I needed a plan, and most of all—

I needed to know what the hell had happened to Greg O’Neal.


The night was thick with humidity, the air clinging to my skin like a second layer. Greg O’Neal’s house stood ahead, dark and hollow, abandoned in the wake of his murder. The yellow police tape still fluttered against the porch railing, curling at the edges, but no one was watching this place anymore.

I stepped over the tape, my boots hitting the wooden steps with a soft creak. The door was still open—just enough for me to slip inside. The stench hit me immediately, thick and rotten, the kind of smell that burrows into your sinuses and lingers. Death. Even after they’d taken the body, scrubbed the floors, it still sat heavy in the air.

I pulled the collar of my jacket up, breathing through my mouth as I moved through the small living room. The furniture was cheap and well-worn, a sagging couch pushed against the wall, a stained recliner in the corner. A coffee table sat between them, littered with old magazines, cigarette butts, and a ring of dried blood where something—someone—had sat.

I crouched down, examining the dried stain. Greg had been dead for days before they found him, his dog half-starved by the door. There were things here that didn’t add up, and I wasn’t leaving without answers.

I moved toward the back of the house, careful not to disturb anything. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, the hinges groaning as I pushed it open. The bed was unmade, sheets still tangled, like someone had been in a hurry. A dresser stood against the far wall, drawers hanging open, empty. Someone had been here before me.

I stepped closer, my eyes catching on something wedged between the dresser and the wall. A scrap of paper, folded and creased. I crouched, pulling it free, unfolding it with careful fingers. The ink was smudged, but I could still make out the words.

PETERSON COMP STA #12—01:30

A date was scrawled beneath it, a week before Greg was found dead. I stared at it for a long moment, my pulse thrumming in my ears. He had known something. He’d gone out there for a reason, and whatever he’d found had cost him his life.

My pulse jumped as I heard a noise, soft, barely there, but enough to send a prickle down my spine. I turned sharply, scanning the darkened doorway. The house settled around me, the wind whispering through the open front door. There was nothing, only my nerves. I exhaled slowly, tucking the paper into my pocket before moving back toward the living room. I needed to check the kitchen, see if Greg had left anything behind—notes, receipts, anything.

I barely made it two steps before something slammed into the side of my jaw.

Pain exploded through my skull, bright and searing. My vision blurred, my knees buckling as I staggered, catching myself against the wall. Another hit—this one harder. My head snapped to the side, stars bursting behind my eyes, my body giving out beneath me.

The floor rushed up to meet me.

Then there was nothing.


I woke up in a jail cell that smelled like sweat, old paper, and the sharp, metallic tang of dried blood—the kind you don’t notice at first, but lingers beneath the surface, clinging to the air, waiting to be acknowledged. I sat up on the edge of my cot, elbows resting on my knees, watching the bars in front of me with the kind of measured patience that only came when you knew no one was coming to help you.

The silence pressed against me, thick and unmoving, broken only by the steady ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands moving with the slow, mechanical certainty of something that had seen more men wait out long nights than I could ever count. I rubbed my jaw, feeling the faint bruise forming there, and exhaled through my nose.

Then came the footsteps, boots against linoleum, the shift of a belt, the soft jingle of keys tapping against metal. I just listened as they came closer, as they stopped just beyond the bars, as a familiar weight settled into the air like a hand pressing firm against the back of my neck.

I finally lifted my gaze. Wilkes was standing there, one hand on his belt, the other holding a paper cup, steam curling from its rim. The old man took a slow sip of coffee, then let out a long sigh, shaking his head. ""Hell of a mess you got yourself in.""
For a second, just a second, it felt like being twelve again.

Like I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, listening to him spin stories about Samson and his jawbone, about David and his sling, about all the times when God didn’t spare the sinners, when the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole, when fire rained from the sky and turned entire cities to dust.

The stories they never told in church, but that he was always eager to share, delighting in the details.

“You’re real lucky, though,” Wilkes said, taking a slow sip of coffee. “If it were anybody else, they might’ve decided to charge you with something a little more serious than a night in jail.”

I snorted, rolling my shoulders. “On what, trespassing?”

Wilkes hummed, shifting his head slightly. “Could’ve been breaking and entering. Maybe even attempted burglary, if they were feelin’ mean about it.”

I tilted my head slightly, glancing at the bars between us. ""You know I had to try and find out what happened.""

Something flickered in Wilkes’ face, but it was gone before I could name it. The sheriff sighed, a deep, weary sound, and leaned back in his chair, rubbing a hand over his face like a man who had spent too many nights awake, watching over something he couldn’t protect.

“You’re reckless, son,” Wilkes said finally, his voice lower now, not scolding, but something else. Something softer. “You run around this town kicking up dust, looking under rocks that oughta stay put, and one day, you’re gonna find something you wish you hadn’t.”

I raised one weary eyebrow. “You worried about me, Sheriff?”

Wilkes exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “Course I am.” He looked down at the desk, tapping one finger against the wood. “Watched you grow up. Watched all of you grow up. And now I’m sittin’ here, wonderin’ if I’m about to watch you throw yourself headfirst into something you can’t come back from.”

I looked down at the cracks in the concrete floor of the cell, thinking it over.

“You ever read Ezekiel 31, Sheriff?”

Wilkes' eyes flicked up, just for a second.

I took that as my answer.

""Talks about shepherds,"" I continued, my voice steady. ""The ones who do right, and the ones who don’t. How the Lord gets mighty pissed at the ones who fatten themselves on the flock, who trample the pasture, who leave the lambs scattered, hungry, lost.""

Wilkes exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. ""You always did have a memory for scripture.""

I smiled faintly. ""Got it from you, Sheriff.""

Wilkes sat there, watching me, unmoving, unreadable.

""My father was a carpenter,"" I said. ""Built everything we ever had with his own two hands. Didn’t have much growing up, but I had him. And he wasn’t perfect. But he worked, and he prayed, and he tried—tried his damnedest—to be a good man. A better man than his father was.""

I took a deep breath, pausing for a minute.

""I keep thinking about that, lately. About what it means to be good. About what it means to stand in the light of the Lord and walk in the path of the righteous man.""

Wilkes’ fingers stilled against the cup, his jaw tightening slightly.

""See, I used to think it was simple. I used to think there were good men and there were bad men, and all you had to do was be good."" I let out a breath, shaking my head slightly. ""But it ain’t that simple, is it? Nah, the world don’t work that way.""

Wilkes didn’t say a word. I looked at him then, really looked at him—the lines in his face deeper than he remembered, his shoulders not quite as squared as they used to be. I thought of all the years Wilkes had spent keeping this town in order, all the weight he carried.

""It’s hard to be good,"" I said. ""Hard to stand in a place like this and tell yourself you’re still walking the righteous path. Cain thought he could walk it. Abel did too. But the first story of man is the story of one man killing another. The first time blood ever touched the earth.""

Wilkes’ expression didn’t change, but something in his posture shifted, just slightly.
I leaned forward, resting my forearms on my knees.

""Every man’s got a choice,"" I murmured. ""To be the shepherd, or to be the sinner. To raise his hand, or to keep it by his side.""

I swallowed hard.

“And I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.”

Wilkes’s fingers tapped against his desk, slow, rhythmic, thoughtful. Then, finally, he spoke.

""I know you are,"" he said, voice steady. ""And that’s what worries me.""

Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. Then Wilkes let out a long breath, stood, and walked over to the cell. He pulled out the key, turned it in the lock with a soft, metallic click.

He stood, slowly and deliberately, walked on over, and unlocked the cell door.
“Mac paid your bail.”

He didn’t look at me as I stepped past him, moving toward the open door, toward the first breath of morning air spilling into the station.

But as I reached the threshold, the light cutting across my face, I heard Wilkes sigh quietly, almost resignedly. 

“Just go home, Alan.”

ALAN RUSSELL

They found the bodies on Sunday.

I heard about it before I even saw the papers, before the whispers started rolling through town like a slow-moving sickness, twisting their way through the streets, through the diners, through the school hallways. News like that doesn’t spread. It seeps, like blood through fabric. By the time the sun had fully risen, everyone knew.

By noon, the story was already set in stone.

Kevin and Don, drunk or high or both, had wandered out to the train tracks in the dead of night, draped themselves in a tarp, and fallen into such a deep, careless sleep that they hadn’t woken up when a thousand-ton train came bearing down on them at sixty miles an hour.

By evening, their names were cautionary tales, spoken in hushed, disapproving tones.

By Monday morning, they were just another small-town tragedy, another set of parents left burying their sons, another gruesome accident that no one wanted to think too hard about.


The conductor had seen them first, lying just past the junction outside of town, a few miles down the old freight line where the rust crept up the rails and weeds poked through the gravel. The tarp covering them was blue, weathered by the elements, barely distinguishable from the ground in the dark.

At first, he thought it was debris, a bundle of junk left behind by drifters or careless hunters. But as he got closer, the shape became clearer, more deliberate—two forms beneath the fabric, motionless, long limbs sprawled awkwardly over the steel rails.

He hit the horn. They didn’t move.

He threw the brakes. The train didn’t stop.

It took nearly a mile for it to slow, for the screeching metal to finally drag to a halt, but by then, it was too late.

By then, the bodies had already been torn apart, scattered across the tracks in dark, wet ribbons, pieces flung into the grass, into the gravel, into the deep ditches lining the junction like open graves.

The crew searched the scene with grim, reluctant hands, collecting what was left of Kevin’s arms, Don’s ribs, fragments of skull and torn fabric, piecing them together like a grotesque puzzle. That’s when they noticed that the blood wasn’t red. It was thick and purple, clotted like syrup, far too viscous, soaking into the ground in sluggish, gelatinous pools.

Any doctor, any forensic pathologist, any damn coroner with half a brain could tell you what that meant.

By the time the steel wheels tore through the bodies, splitting flesh from bone, scattering viscera across the tracks, they had already been dead.

I wasn’t a doctor. Neither was Mac or Heather. None of us had the medical knowledge to stand in that morgue and tell them they were full of shit, to point at the viscous, purple blood pooling in the plastic bags and tell them that people don’t die like that.

The medical examiner—Dr. Yasin Halak, a man who had been working in Ashwood longer than I had been alive, longer than my mother had lived here—gave the official cause of death at noon.

The boys had gone hunting, as they often did, but this time, they had gotten reckless. They had gotten stoned off their asses on “the dreaded marijuana,” lost track of time, lost track of their minds, stumbled onto the train tracks, and, for some unfathomable reason, pulled a tarp over themselves and passed out cold, dead to the world.

So dead, apparently, that a roaring freight train had not been enough to stir them from their sleep.

So dead that they hadn’t moved when the engine bore down on them, hadn’t twitched when the horn blared, hadn’t so much as shifted when the wheels finally met flesh.

Halak stood at that podium, in front of the whole town, and said this with a straight face.

Like Don, who had spent half his life handling firearms, tracking animals, surviving in the woods, would’ve decided to just fall asleep on the goddamn train tracks after smoking a little weed.

Like Kevin, who had been the lightest lightweight I had ever known, who never got high when we went night spotting because he was too paranoid about making a mistake, would have just let it happen.

He said it like it was reasonable, like it made sense, like we were all supposed to just accept it and move on.

And the worst part?

Most people did.


Don’s mother stood stone-faced at the service, her grief too deep to bend into words, her bodies too hollowed out to hold onto anything but the weight of loss. Don’s brothers, Nathan, Oliver, and little Sam sat behind her, shaky-legged and confused. Oliver and Sam were young, too young to understand that Don wasn’t coming home, tugging Nathan’s sleeve, asking if they could go to the catering table—and Nathan was too young to look as old as he did, the lines of loss etching themselves deep into the twelve-year old’s youthful face. He looked more like Don every day.

Kevin’s father was hit the hardest. He stood for the entire service, eyes firmly locked on the coffin of the last member of his family, silent tears streaming down the practiced iron face of a United States Marine. It occurred to me that this was the first time I had ever seen him without a bottle in his hand, something he explained when he gave his eulogy.

“I-I could have been a better father. Coming back, I wasn’t ready, I turned to the bottle to… try to deal with it. Kevin-Kevin looked up to me like you wouldn’t believe, thought I was a hero, and I let him down. Everyday. Watching his little face fall was worse than anything I ever had to do over there. But I… didn’t change and I guess he tried to deal with it the only way he knew—the way I did. If… if that shit did that to my boy, I’m never touching a drop of it again, memories be damned.”

After he walked off the stage with the brisk steps of a broken soldier, they brought up a bunch of Kevin and Don’s old teachers and classmates. We sat in the church pews, listening to people who had never really known them talk about them like they had, feeling our teeth press into our tongues as we tried to hold back the things we really wanted to say.

That it wasn’t their fault.

That they hadn’t died like that.

The town had already cried for them, for the boys they thought they knew. For the cautionary tale they had turned them into.

Kevin and Don, the reckless, foolish kids who had thrown their lives away in a haze of smoke and bad decisions, who had been claimed by the same stupid vices that had claimed a hundred others before them.

They didn’t get to be the boys we knew. They didn’t get to be smart, or funny, or stupid in the way that made life fun instead of tragic.

They didn’t get to be people anymore.

They were just a story now, another cautionary tale, another lesson to scare the younger kids straight, a tragedy they could shake their heads at over coffee, muttering about how they had thrown their lives away over drugs and bad decisions.


We should have said something.

We should have stood up, right there in that church, and screamed the truth at the top of our lungs, that their bodies had been dumped there, left like garbage on the tracks to be found.

But we didn’t.

Mac’s hands hadn’t stopped shaking since the moment we’d walked in. Heather hadn’t looked up from her lap. I sat there, gripping Kevin’s old lighter so tightly it left an indent in my palm, staring at the polished caskets at the front of the room, knowing—no one was in them. Not really, not the way they had been. The pieces of them had been collected. Put back together as best they could be.

But the real Don, the real Kevin—they had been gone long before that train hit them. 

I sure as hell didn’t trust the police, not after what we had seen. I knew better than to walk into that station and ask questions, but I needed to know, now more than ever.

I had other leads, people who might have been willing to talk if they thought I was the only one listening.

Greg O’Neal had told me to wait for his call. I had been waiting ever since.

Now, with Kevin and Don buried beneath the dirt, I wasn’t waiting anymore.

That night, after the funeral, after the murmured condolences, after Mac had punched a hole in the wall of my garage and Heather had sobbed into my shoulder for hours, I grabbed my father’s gun and I went looking for answers.




HEATHER ROBINSON


Alan held me like he knew I might break.

Like if he let go, I would crumble to pieces, scatter at his feet like shattered glass, slip between the cracks in the floor and disappear completely. I pressed my face into his shoulder, breathing in the scent of wood smoke and old leather, my fingers clutching at the fabric of his jacket, digging in like I could hold myself together by holding onto him.

The grief didn’t come all at once.

It bled in slow, crawling waves, filling the spaces between my ribs, creeping up my throat, pooling behind my eyes. I didn’t cry at first—just stood there, trembling, silent, too hollowed out to process the depth of what I had lost.

And then it hit me, all at once, like a tidal wave crashing over a broken levy.

Kevin was gone.

Don was gone.

The weight of those words pressed down on me, crushed me, swallowed me whole.

I broke and Alan let me.

There were no more stupid inside jokes, no more late-night drives, no more drunken confessions whispered between cigarette drags, no more Don rolling his eyes and Kevin making some sarcastic quip to lighten the mood.

There was just this hole, this sickening, gaping wound that had opened inside my chest, something I could never fill again.

And it hurt.

God, it hurt.

I don’t know how long I cried, but Alan didn’t let go. He just stood there, holding me up, like he knew I couldn’t stand on my own anymore.



I left shortly after, still dizzy with grief, still raw, like my insides had been scraped out and left in the dirt beside their caskets.

The wind was cold as I walked, cutting through the thin fabric of my dress, stinging my skin. I kept my arms wrapped tightly around myself, head down, feet moving automatically over the familiar road that led toward home. The pavement stretched ahead of me in long, jagged cracks, veins splitting through the asphalt like the town itself was coming apart.

Then, a sound—the low, slow roll of tires creeping up beside me.

The glow of headlights crawled along the street, reaching for my shadow, stretching it long and thin against the ground.

I knew who it was before he spoke.

“Hey.”

Trevor’s voice was too casual, too normal, like he was greeting me in the school parking lot instead of pulling up beside me on the way home from my dead friends’ funeral.

I kept walking.

The truck slowed, keeping pace with me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked, genuinely confused, like he didn’t already know, like he hadn’t been somewhere else, anywhere else, instead of sitting next to me in that church pew.

My hands curled into fists.

A sharp, bitter laugh pushed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, clenched my jaw, forced myself to breathe. I turned my head just enough to see his face, to take in the way he tilted his head in mild confusion, unbothered, unaffected, like he had never known them, never known me.

Something inside me cracked.

And I realized, with startling, suffocating clarity—

I hated him.

I hated his detachment, his self-importance, the way he could so effortlessly pretend that nothing had changed. I hated the fact that he hadn’t been there, hadn’t thought to call, hadn’t thought to ask if I was okay until I was walking alone in the dark with grief bleeding out of me in short, sharp, arterial bursts.

I turned back.

Kept walking.

“Hey—Heather.” His voice tightened, just a little, that edge of frustration creeping in. “Come on, don’t be like that.”

His car sped up for a second, pulling ahead, then slowed again, the tires grinding against the pavement.

I didn’t look at him. Didn’t stop. Didn’t care how pissed he was. I just walked, straight to my house, straight inside and slammed the door shut behind me.

I didn’t turn on the lights.

Just peeled off my dress, kicked off my shoes, crawled under the covers, and stared at the ceiling. But something felt… off.

It was subtle at first, just a tickle at the back of my skull, something I couldn’t place.

The air in the room was too thick, too heavy, pressing down on my skin like a damp cloth. The silence was too deep, stretched tight like a wire, like it was just waiting to snap.

I turned onto my side.

Told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, grieving, paranoid.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.




I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not my own.

Not… human.

Something slow. Something measured. Something wet.

The air in my room was thick with it, damp and unnatural, each inhale slow, rattling, wet, like something sucking air through hollowed-out bone. The sound slithered over my skin, pressing into my ears, crawling down my throat like smoke, pooling in my lungs like a second presence, something inside me, something breathing with me.

I tried to move.

I couldn’t.

A weight pinned me down, crushing my chest into the mattress, pressing my arms into my sides, my muscles locked into place like I had been buried alive.

I could feel it.

Something was sitting on me, pinning me to the mattress, pressing my body down into the sheets with deliberate cruelty, allowing me just enough breath to stay awake, to keep struggling, to remain trapped in the moment where waking turned to nightmare and nightmare turned to something worse.

My skin crawled, the back of my neck prickling like when I was a child, when I used to lie awake at night, convinced something was waiting in the closet, beneath my bed, just out of sight.

I wasn’t wrong back then.

I wasn’t wrong now.

And if I looked, if I let my gaze slip toward the darkness pooling in the corners of my bedroom, toward the places where my childhood nightmares had always waited for me, if I dared to look too closely—

I would see the others, too.





The closet door was open.

I didn’t remember leaving it open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

But now, in the suffocating dark, it had cracked just enough to reveal the narrow stretch of empty floor, the space between my hanging clothes, the place where I used to imagine glowing eyes blinking back at me from the void.

Something moved inside.

It was not solid, not a figure, not a shape, but rather the absence of a shape, an unraveling of reality, thick and black as ink, shifting in the dim light, pulsing, the suggestion of a form flickering in and out of existence.

Then—

The tips of black, razor-sharp claws curled around the edge of the doorframe, sinking into the wood.

It was steadying itself.

It had been waiting for me to notice.

A horrible, slow shudder rippled through the dark, and then it leaned forward, just slightly, just enough to be sure I knew—

It was looking at me.

The air grew colder, pressing into my ears, my ribs, my throat. I could feel the sheets beneath me, feel the mattress at my back—

And then, I felt something shift below me, a gentle, almost playful movement.

A pressure pressing up into my spine. Something was beneath the bed.

I had been afraid of this, once—when I was four, five, six years old, lying awake at night, legs curled up so they wouldn’t dangle over the side, so nothing could grab me, yank me down, pull me under.

I wasn’t four years old anymore, but I had never been more convinced that if I set one foot on the floor, I would be dragged into something I wouldn’t return from.

The breathing was closer now, curling over the mattress from all directions, seeping from the floorboards, from the corners of the room, from the spaces where darkness stretched too deep, where it pooled in places it had no right to be.

The creaking started, slow and deliberate, my headboard shaking ever so slightly. 

I couldn’t see past the edge of my mattress, but I felt it moving, shifting its weight from one foot to the other, measured, careful, like it didn’t want to wake me up.

It was closer than the first one, too close.

The stench of smoke and rotting meat filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, sinking into my skin, curling against my tongue.

It moved again. It was not solid, not completely.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye, a shape unraveling, folding into itself, shifting like liquid shadow, like a cloud of black ink spilled across water, its outline flickering in and out of reality, its presence undeniable even when it disappeared completely.

It was watching me.

It was hovering over me.

I could feel it leaning in, face hovering inches from mine, breath curling hot and damp against my cheek.

The smell of blood was thick in the air.

Something in the closet shifted again, fingers tightening around the wood, the unseen weight on my chest growing heavier, heavier, heavier, the edges of my vision dimming.

And suddenly I was back in middle school.

Mr. Corbin had fallen in a twisted heap of broken limbs and fabric, like something that had been dropped rather than collapsed, his fingers still curled into the fabric of his slacks, his back arched unnaturally, as if the bullet had locked him into place.

I had stared at him, unable to reconcile the shape of his body with the shape of the man he had been, watching as the blood crawled between the tiles, as thick and slow and endless as the River Lethe.

I had squeezed my eyes shut then, trying to pretend it wasn’t real, trying to pretend I wasn’t seeing it, that if I stopped looking, it would stop existing.

It hadn’t worked then, it wouldn’t work now.

Because I could still see him, could still see the way his mouth had fallen open, lips twisted in a way that no longer belonged to him, his face empty, hollow, frozen in the moment when he realized he was about to die.

And something in the darkness—something woven from inky black smoke and elongated limbs—laughed.

The weight on my chest never lessened, but I could feel a new presence, a new shape pressing into the mattress at my back, something curling itself around my spine, winding through my ribs like ivy, seeping into the spaces where I had long since stopped believing anything holy remained.

Its fingers trailed lightly over the skin of my neck, feather-light, tender, almost affectionate.

And then—a sound above me, a slow, wet clicking.

I had always been afraid of this, the idea that something could perch on the headboard of my bed, looking down at me while I slept, curling its claws into the wood, waiting for me to wake up so I could see it.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t—

It was not solid, not fully formed, an unraveling thing, shifting between states, visible and not, present and not, real and not, a creature made of ink and shadow, pouring through my bed frame, coiling beneath my sheets, wrapping its tendrils around my wrists like bracelets made of bone.

Something sharp pressed into my wrists. A long, curved raven’s talon, curling against my pulse, tracing the delicate, vulnerable stretch of skin, where my veins rose close to the surface.

And then, with a slow, deliberate pressure, it sank into my wrists.

Pain erupted in twin streaks of fire, sharp and hot, sending a bolt of electricity up my arms, every nerve ending screaming at once. My vision blurred, my breath ripped from my lungs in a silent, shuddering gasp.

Something wet dripped down my arms. The thing above me pressed closer, whispering something I couldn’t understand, something too old and too heavy and too broken for human ears.

And then—I woke up.

Jerking violently, gasping for air, hands flying to my wrists, breath shattering in my throat as I ran my fingers over the skin that should have been smooth, should have been whole.

It wasn’t.

Two long, deep scratches ran the length of my wrists, carved into my flesh like a signature welling with blood.

The closet door was still open. The room was as still as a mausoleum.

And in the shadows where my nightmares had always lived—

Something breathed, waiting for me to sleep again.



ALAN RUSSELL

I found Greg O’Neal’s address the old-fashioned way—sifting through old phone books, talking to the right people, using my fake id to pay for a couple of drinks at Callahan’s, and finally, after piecing together information like a puzzle made of half-rotted scraps, I had an address.

It sat in a part of town that felt like it had been forgotten on purpose, a place where the paint peeled faster than people could afford to cover it up, where the sidewalks were cracked and buckling, where the streetlights burned too dim or not at all.

By the time I pulled up, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon, a pale slit of dull pink light barely strong enough to push through the lingering night.

I should have been the first one there, but I wasn’t.

Two Dodge Polaras sat parked in front of the house, their red and blue lights casting eerie pulses across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the strips of yellow crime scene tape that flapped lazily in the early morning breeze.

And the front door—the front door was wide open.

I killed the engine and slid out of my truck, pulling my jacket tighter around myself as I made my way up the cracked sidewalk, shoulders tense, jaw clenched, the Tokarev TT-33 resting like a quiet promise beneath the layers of fabric, the metal icy cold against my skin.

I really needed to buy a holster.

The air reeked of something sour, something rotten, a stench so thick it made the back of my throat tighten. I had smelled blood before, smelled bodies left too long in places they weren’t supposed to be, but this was something different. Something worse.

The stink curled into my nostrils, settled into my lungs, and as I stepped closer, I saw it. Just past the officers standing at the door, past the flickering glow of cheap overhead bulbs, just barely visible through the open doorway—a corpse, sitting upright.

Headless.

One of the officers swiveled around, turning towards me before I could get any closer.

“Crime scene’s closed.”

I pulled my hands from my jacket pockets, raising them in an easy, slow-moving gesture. “Didn’t know there was a crime scene, officer.”

His eyes narrowed. “Then why are you here?”

I let my expression stay neutral, ignoring the tight coil of unease winding its way up my spine.

“Friend of a friend told me Greg O’Neal lived here. Haven’t heard from him in a few days.”

The other officer—younger, thinner, the kind of guy who still looked nervous when he put on the badge in the morning—shifted uncomfortably before speaking.

“Yeah, well. You won’t be hearing from him now.”

I didn’t ask what’d happened, I didn’t have to. I had already seen enough.

But the first officer—the older one, built like a brick wall, with eyes that looked like they had seen a thousand things no man should ever see—decided I should hear it anyway.

“Neighbor called it in,” he said, voice gruff, tired, the tone of a man who had been awake too long and had seen too much. “Said the smell was leaking out onto the street. We get here, we knock, we get no answer. We step inside, and there he is. Melting into the goddamn couch.”

His lip curled slightly, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered disgust in his eyes, the thing he was trying to swallow down, bury, forget.

“The top half of him, anyway.”

I didn’t ask where the head was.

They didn’t know, or maybe they did, and they didn’t want to say it out loud. I had seen enough strange things to know that some wounds didn’t bleed the way they were supposed to, that some deaths weren’t meant to be neatly written down in a coroner’s report.

Something felt wrong about this, though. Not just the body, not just the missing head. The house itself was too quiet, not the kind of quiet that came from an empty building, but the kind of quiet that came from something waiting, something watching, something pressing against the walls just beneath the surface, curling its fingers into the floorboards, stretching through the drywall.

Something had happened here and whatever it was—it hadn’t left.

I was about to turn back when the dog came out.

The first thing I noticed was the blood.

It was matted into its fur, dried and crusted in dark, jagged streaks, caking the white of its paws, staining the gray of its snout. It snarled and thrashed, teeth bared, foam bubbling at the edges of its mouth, the leash wrapped tight around the wrist of one of the officers as he struggled to drag the animal toward the car.

“Son of a bitch hasn’t let anyone near him since we got here,” the younger officer muttered, keeping his distance.

“Wouldn’t either, if I’d been locked in here for days with a corpse.”

I watched as they forced the dog into the backseat of one of the Dodge Polaras, the metal door slamming shut behind it.

It kept snarling, snapping, eyes wild, like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to attack or run or rip the whole goddamn world apart.

Something about it didn’t sit right.

Dogs mourned, dogs starved, dogs howled and whimpered and shrank beneath the weight of grief and loneliness.

But this?

This dog was angry.

And for some reason, that scared me more than the body.

I had come looking for answers.

Instead, I had found a corpse with no head, a house that smelled like death, and a dog that had seen something no living being could understand.

I had nothing.

No leads. No direction. No next move.

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, turning back toward my truck, keeping my eyes on the cracked pavement as I walked, forcing myself not to look back at the house, not to let my mind pick apart the way the door still stood open, how the shadows inside seemed darker than they should have been, deeper than they should have been.

I climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life beneath my hands. I sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, staring at my own reflection in the windshield, watching the red and blue lights flicker over my skin.

I needed a holster, I needed a plan, and most of all—

I needed to know what the hell had happened to Greg O’Neal.


The night was thick with humidity, the air clinging to my skin like a second layer. Greg O’Neal’s house stood ahead, dark and hollow, abandoned in the wake of his murder. The yellow police tape still fluttered against the porch railing, curling at the edges, but no one was watching this place anymore.

I stepped over the tape, my boots hitting the wooden steps with a soft creak. The door was still open—just enough for me to slip inside. The stench hit me immediately, thick and rotten, the kind of smell that burrows into your sinuses and lingers. Death. Even after they’d taken the body, scrubbed the floors, it still sat heavy in the air.

I pulled the collar of my jacket up, breathing through my mouth as I moved through the small living room. The furniture was cheap and well-worn, a sagging couch pushed against the wall, a stained recliner in the corner. A coffee table sat between them, littered with old magazines, cigarette butts, and a ring of dried blood where something—someone—had sat.

I crouched down, examining the dried stain. Greg had been dead for days before they found him, his dog half-starved by the door. There were things here that didn’t add up, and I wasn’t leaving without answers.

I moved toward the back of the house, careful not to disturb anything. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, the hinges groaning as I pushed it open. The bed was unmade, sheets still tangled, like someone had been in a hurry. A dresser stood against the far wall, drawers hanging open, empty. Someone had been here before me.

I stepped closer, my eyes catching on something wedged between the dresser and the wall. A scrap of paper, folded and creased. I crouched, pulling it free, unfolding it with careful fingers. The ink was smudged, but I could still make out the words.

PETERSON COMP STA #12—01:30

A date was scrawled beneath it, a week before Greg was found dead. I stared at it for a long moment, my pulse thrumming in my ears. He had known something. He’d gone out there for a reason, and whatever he’d found had cost him his life.

My pulse jumped as I heard a noise, soft, barely there, but enough to send a prickle down my spine. I turned sharply, scanning the darkened doorway. The house settled around me, the wind whispering through the open front door. There was nothing, only my nerves. I exhaled slowly, tucking the paper into my pocket before moving back toward the living room. I needed to check the kitchen, see if Greg had left anything behind—notes, receipts, anything.

I barely made it two steps before something slammed into the side of my jaw.

Pain exploded through my skull, bright and searing. My vision blurred, my knees buckling as I staggered, catching myself against the wall. Another hit—this one harder. My head snapped to the side, stars bursting behind my eyes, my body giving out beneath me.

The floor rushed up to meet me.

Then there was nothing.


I woke up in a jail cell that smelled like sweat, old paper, and the sharp, metallic tang of dried blood—the kind you don’t notice at first, but lingers beneath the surface, clinging to the air, waiting to be acknowledged. I sat up on the edge of my cot, elbows resting on my knees, watching the bars in front of me with the kind of measured patience that only came when you knew no one was coming to help you.

The silence pressed against me, thick and unmoving, broken only by the steady ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands moving with the slow, mechanical certainty of something that had seen more men wait out long nights than I could ever count. I rubbed my jaw, feeling the faint bruise forming there, and exhaled through my nose.

Then came the footsteps, boots against linoleum, the shift of a belt, the soft jingle of keys tapping against metal. I just listened as they came closer, as they stopped just beyond the bars, as a familiar weight settled into the air like a hand pressing firm against the back of my neck.

I finally lifted my gaze. Wilkes was standing there, one hand on his belt, the other holding a paper cup, steam curling from its rim. The old man took a slow sip of coffee, then let out a long sigh, shaking his head. ""Hell of a mess you got yourself in.""
For a second, just a second, it felt like being twelve again.

Like I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, listening to him spin stories about Samson and his jawbone, about David and his sling, about all the times when God didn’t spare the sinners, when the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole, when fire rained from the sky and turned entire cities to dust.

The stories they never told in church, but that he was always eager to share, delighting in the details.

“You’re real lucky, though,” Wilkes said, taking a slow sip of coffee. “If it were anybody else, they might’ve decided to charge you with something a little more serious than a night in jail.”

I snorted, rolling my shoulders. “On what, trespassing?”

Wilkes hummed, shifting his head slightly. “Could’ve been breaking and entering. Maybe even attempted burglary, if they were feelin’ mean about it.”

I tilted my head slightly, glancing at the bars between us. ""You know I had to try and find out what happened.""

Something flickered in Wilkes’ face, but it was gone before I could name it. The sheriff sighed, a deep, weary sound, and leaned back in his chair, rubbing a hand over his face like a man who had spent too many nights awake, watching over something he couldn’t protect.

“You’re reckless, son,” Wilkes said finally, his voice lower now, not scolding, but something else. Something softer. “You run around this town kicking up dust, looking under rocks that oughta stay put, and one day, you’re gonna find something you wish you hadn’t.”

I raised one weary eyebrow. “You worried about me, Sheriff?”

Wilkes exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “Course I am.” He looked down at the desk, tapping one finger against the wood. “Watched you grow up. Watched all of you grow up. And now I’m sittin’ here, wonderin’ if I’m about to watch you throw yourself headfirst into something you can’t come back from.”

I looked down at the cracks in the concrete floor of the cell, thinking it over.

“You ever read Ezekiel 31, Sheriff?”

Wilkes' eyes flicked up, just for a second.

I took that as my answer.

""Talks about shepherds,"" I continued, my voice steady. ""The ones who do right, and the ones who don’t. How the Lord gets mighty pissed at the ones who fatten themselves on the flock, who trample the pasture, who leave the lambs scattered, hungry, lost.""

Wilkes exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. ""You always did have a memory for scripture.""

I smiled faintly. ""Got it from you, Sheriff.""

Wilkes sat there, watching me, unmoving, unreadable.

""My father was a carpenter,"" I said. ""Built everything we ever had with his own two hands. Didn’t have much growing up, but I had him. And he wasn’t perfect. But he worked, and he prayed, and he tried—tried his damnedest—to be a good man. A better man than his father was.""

I took a deep breath, pausing for a minute.

""I keep thinking about that, lately. About what it means to be good. About what it means to stand in the light of the Lord and walk in the path of the righteous man.""

Wilkes’ fingers stilled against the cup, his jaw tightening slightly.

""See, I used to think it was simple. I used to think there were good men and there were bad men, and all you had to do was be good."" I let out a breath, shaking my head slightly. ""But it ain’t that simple, is it? Nah, the world don’t work that way.""

Wilkes didn’t say a word. I looked at him then, really looked at him—the lines in his face deeper than he remembered, his shoulders not quite as squared as they used to be. I thought of all the years Wilkes had spent keeping this town in order, all the weight he carried.

""It’s hard to be good,"" I said. ""Hard to stand in a place like this and tell yourself you’re still walking the righteous path. Cain thought he could walk it. Abel did too. But the first story of man is the story of one man killing another. The first time blood ever touched the earth.""

Wilkes’ expression didn’t change, but something in his posture shifted, just slightly.
I leaned forward, resting my forearms on my knees.

""Every man’s got a choice,"" I murmured. ""To be the shepherd, or to be the sinner. To raise his hand, or to keep it by his side.""

I swallowed hard.

“And I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.”

Wilkes’s fingers tapped against his desk, slow, rhythmic, thoughtful. Then, finally, he spoke.

""I know you are,"" he said, voice steady. ""And that’s what worries me.""

Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. Then Wilkes let out a long breath, stood, and walked over to the cell. He pulled out the key, turned it in the lock with a soft, metallic click.

He stood, slowly and deliberately, walked on over, and unlocked the cell door.
“Mac paid your bail.”

He didn’t look at me as I stepped past him, moving toward the open door, toward the first breath of morning air spilling into the station.

But as I reached the threshold, the light cutting across my face, I heard Wilkes sigh quietly, almost resignedly. 

“Just go home, Alan.”

Since starting antidepressants, I’ve been able to get out of my rut, finish school, live on my own, work a job… but I still feel like something is missing.

For example: I enjoy movies, (at least I’m supposed to) but nowadays when I watch them, they barely have an effect on me. I’m watching them, and I’m feeling very little in return. Horror movies? I barely flinch.

Am I a zombie? Lowkey feels like it, sometimes. Sure, I’m dealing with life and all its challenges, as a 24 year old (a turbulent time for many people), but am I actually “feeling” things?

I’ve tried coffee, it can sometimes help, maybe provide dopamine to balance out the excess serotonin from the meds. But I’m not sure that it’s always enough. I miss feeling things…

But of course, that would mean feeling the BAD stuff as well. Which was almost constant, to the point that I was barely living. I would always be feeling things so strongly, and a part of me misses the good parts of that. 

Is this a compromise that I must deal with? Does everyone deal with this, to some degree?

I worked at Cafe 1. My hands often get dry because of the harsh chemicals. I left this cafe at the end of 2024.
I am now at Cafe 2. My hands still get dry and few weeks into starting this new job I had this crack in my finger, like a really deep cut. It healed when I called out sick for work a few days two weeks ago. But it since reopened (yesterday) after I went back to work a week ago.

Problem: 
Today, I expressed that “my hands are effed up again after going back to work”.

He responded that I need to wear gloves, like as if I hadn’t, even though I had been.

It’s frustrating because he kept saying the same thing, and it sounds very.. accusatory? Like I’m purposely not wearing gloves. And he says that I need to double glove so I don’t have to wash as often. Mind you, I work in the food industry. 

So this triggers me because I feel attacked by what he said. Basically it’s my fault; I am purposely doing it to myself. It’s obviously no one’s fault but my hands are just that sensitive but why hasn’t he thought of that maybe my skin is just really sensitive? Like today, I hit my hand against the door and I already have a cut. From what? Idek. My skin is just delicate in that sense.

He then said he expects that I can resolve these small issues and to not bring it up because I’m an adult. I said I didn’t want him to solve anything. But he says he can’t help wanting to provide advice whenever I talk about a problem because this issue has been ongoing (which I didn’t realize he was keeping track from when I worked at Cafe 1). Somehow it’s still my fault for not wearing gloves before touching chemicals (I do wear gloves!!)

I said to him that me bringing up something like this is not asking for a solution, I’m just expressing myself. But to him, I am bringing up a problem that seems to not have resolved itself. Well, ok, yeah, seems like this Cafe 2’s soap is extra harsh than the previous and it’s causing my hands to have this issue.

I feel upset because I interpret what he’s just saying as me asking for it when I’m not!! I put on gloves and I wash my hands as I am supposed to (after dealing with garbage and before I touch food or coffee). But even with those times, my skin can’t handle it. 

He said I just start everything with a complaint because this isn’t the first time I talked about my hands being dry and it seems un-resolvable to me. I said that this isn’t un-resolvable. It’s clear that I don’t have a better solution at the moment. I am not asking him for advice, I am just expressing myself.

Then he goes on and says how he expects that I can take care of myself and that small problems like these shouldn’t be spoken of. I said that this is just the same as saying “the weather is nice today” and he said well, that’s a positive thing. So that’s okay.

So I retorted, “so if it’s negative, don’t talk to you about it?” Pretty much.

So… what to do??

**Epilogue.**

A middle aged woman with messy auburn hair and emerald green eyes sits up in her bed, in a cold sweat.

Her heart hammers in her chest as she looks around the room, bleary eyed.  

“Asmodai…?” she whispered softly, shaking her head “...Wait.. what?” She groans as she clumsily reaches for a pair of glasses on her nightstand.

She slides the heavy prescriptions onto her face, blinking the sleep from her eyes as her wild and frazzled hair blocks her vision.

As she clears her hair away, she rubs her temples, “...What was that dream about?” She shakes her head, the memories fading rapidly, “Something about… Some big tall man… with blue eyes,” she blushed, “Hmm… shame I can’t remember it.”

Her phone continues to blare a loud alarm, and she picks it up, turning the alarm off.

She glances at the time, and to her texts.

The time is 8:00 AM in the morning, and a number of texts are waiting for her.

“Ugh,” the mousey woman sighs, flipping through the messages.

The messages were all from her known contacts.

Jason: “Happy Birthday, Mom!  See you at 6!”

Dad: “Happy Birthday, Sweetie!”

Mom: “From the proudest mom ever, Happy birthday!”

David: “Happy Birthday, Sara!  A big breakfast is ready when you wake up.”

Sara sighs, replying thank you to all, saving David’s for last.

*“I wonder if I should tell David about that risque dream I had about the tall dark and handsome fellow with blue eyes?”* Sara thought to herself as she merely texted David that she was, indeed, awake and would be right down.

As she was about to place the phone down, another message popped up.

David: “Do you need help getting out of bed?”

Sara’s face fell as she looked at the message, typing firmly, “No. I’ll be down on my own, thank you.”

*“On my birthday, David?  Really?”* Sara thought to herself as she leaned over the side of the bed and pushed her folded wheelchair opened.

With practiced expertise, she pushed the sheets off her thin legs, and slid herself into the chair.  After a few moments, she undid the wheel brakes, and pushed herself towards her bathroom.  

“*I’m not helpless, and never will be,”* Sara thought to herself as she wheeled herself past the bathroom threshold.

She disrobed completely, and transferred to another chair within the bathroom in order for her to shower.

After completing her morning routine, she was dressed, her hair washed and brushed straight. Her wardrobe for the office cleanly adorned her lithe body.  The skirt and shoes even did well to hide the emaciated legs that had failed her when she was only 18.

Sara rolled herself to the dining room, where she found her husband David waiting with a large breakfast.

He wore an apron, his brown hair well combed, though a receding hairline was visible.  His brown eyes happily looked to Sara as she rolled into the kitchen.  Under the apron, he wore a pair of simple slacks and a dress shirt with a tie. 

Pancakes, eggs, sausages, and bacon along with a rather large mug of coffee.

“Figured once you hit the shower you’d be out in about 34 minutes,” David chuckled as he placed the food at the only place on the table which didn’t already have a chair.  He gave Sara a peck on the cheek.

“Oh, have you timed me that well?” Sara grinned at him, looking at the food, “You don’t expect me to eat all of this, do you?”

“Well, whatever you don’t eat, I will,” David laughed as he sat down near her.

“And you’re here and not at the office, why?” Sara questioned David.

“Told them I’d be late, as it was your birthday, and I had to get a decent breakfast for you,” he grinned, “Perks of, you know, owning the firm.”

“Oh? And why is this year different from other years, Dear?” Sara asked.

David chuckled, “You don’t turn 50 everyday you know.”

Sara narrowed her eyes on him, “...35, *dear*.”

David chuckled, “Right, right.  For the… tenth time, now?”

Sara took her fork, pointing it menacingly at him, “Don’t make me put *you* in a wheelchair, Mr. Miller.” 

David mockingly placed his hands up, “Okay, Okay.  35, got it.”

Sara rolled her eyes as she dug into her breakfast.

David turned on the TV, flipping on the news, “Wonder if you’re going to get any coverage.”

Sara glanced to the screen, seeing the news scrolling along.

*Demon incursion of 13 years ago all but quelled.  Visas’ offered for Thralls and Half-Demonic entities.  Martial Law ending?*

“I think there’s plenty more going on than just a cure for ALS,” Sara quipped, smiling with a mildly smug grin.

“Right,” David shook his head, “Should still be a big deal.”

“People will find out, mostly those who need it,” Sara sighed, “Just glad I won’t lose my arms.” 

“Was it *all* you or some of that advanced technology that the Empress brought?” David asked, pouring himself a coffee.  

“You do realize all medical research is built by standing on the shoulders of others, right?” Sara quipped, “If not for me, no one would have thought to synthesize the retrovirus that stopped the nerve degradation.  So don’t think I didn’t earn my keep,” Sara joked, frowning slightly, “Your father at least thinks I’m the only one who controls it, that’s for sure.”

“Dad just doesn’t want to see you waste a good opportunity,” David defended.

“Your father just wants a slice of the pie,” Sara sighed, “He’s always thinking of the money, and nothing else,” she pushed herself from the table, “Well, Sir, the meal was very good.  Do I pay here or up front?” Sara joked.  

“Right here is fine,” David said as he moved to Sara to give her a kiss.

Sara kissed him, though as the kiss broke, she felt it paled in comparison to another kiss she had recently.

“*That must have been a* ***hell*** *of a dream,”* Sara thought as she blushed.

“Hmm… haven’t had that effect on you in a while,” David grinned, “Breakfast that good?”

Sara cleared her throat, “...I should get going, or I’ll miss the train.”

David chuckled, “alright then, leave me to clean up, I see how it is!” He smiled and cleaned up the dishes. 

Sara rolled to the door, grabbing her purse and heading out, “I’ll meet you at Jason’s around 6?” she shouted.

“Sure thing, sweetie!  6 on the dot!” David shouted as Sara rolled out the door.

Sara heaved a sigh as she slowly made her way down the ramp in front of her home, and onto the sidewalk.

Her phone rang, and she glanced at the caller ID.  *Murray Miller.*

“Ugh,” Sara grumbled, picking it up, “Hello, *dad.*” 

“Sara, excellent!” Murry Miller’s boisterous voice chimed in over the phone, “So glad I could catch you before you got into the office.  Firstly: Happy Birthday.”

“Mhmm… Thanks,” Sara said curtly.

“Oh, come now, is that any way to talk to your father-in-law?” Murray complained.

“It is when said father-in-law is desperately trying to undermine my work,” Sara countered.

“Undermine?  Sara… I’m just making sure you and David are financially secure.  This whole cure thing you have is amazing, and I commend you on it… but surely to just… give the patents away can’t be your actual decision, can it?  I have friends in the Pharmaceutical industry who would happily assist you in not just making this a dedicated product, but also ensuring that those in need got discount coupons so they could afford it.  It’s a win-win!  Please, just let me connect you with my colleague in Pfizer-”

“No,” Sara snapped, “We’ve been over this.  David makes enough money as is, I don’t want to make this some get-rich quick scheme where all the big pharmaceuticals get a piece of the pie.  This isn’t just for people who can afford it, it’s for the whole world.”

“Sara, listen to me!  Everyone is covered these days thanks to the Penthasilian Health Services, you’d be a fool to not partner with someone to bring this to market in the most profitable way for you and David!”

“Stop saying ‘You and David’, you want us to be stinking rich like you *were* in the early 2000s,” Sara growled into the phone, “David and I are comfortable.  *You* are comfortable.  We don’t *need* yachts and mansions or estates!” She hissed, “I am releasing it not just to the PHS but to everyone, for free, and that includes the Soviet Alliances.”

“Why help those idiots?  And how would you even get it to them, the new Iron Curtain is damn near impenetrable! You’re just being obstinate!” Murray shouted over the phone.

“No,” Sara growled, “I’m being Ethical.  I worked hard to make this cure for *everyone* who had this disease.  I don’t care who they are, Americans, Penthasilians, Russians or Chinese: Everyone who needs it will have access to it.  Now goodbye, dad!” 

Before Murry could argue, she ended the call.

Sara took a heavy and deep sigh, before she turned to her right to see she was passing her favorite  local bar.  “...It’s 5pm somewhere.” Sara turned and rolled into the building, happy to see it opened.

“Bit early for an Irish Coffee, isn’t it Sara?” the bartender called out to her, chuckling as Sara rolled over to the end barstool.

Sara locked her wheelchair, grabbed the handle of the bar, and pulled herself up to the barstool, “Yeah, well…” Sara sighed, “I turned 50 today, Pete.”

Pete, the bartender, let out a whistle.

“No one knows that, by the way.  You tell a soul, and you’re dead,” Sara mock threatened.

“Hey, I’m a bartender,” Pete said as he poured a fresh coffee and added a shot of whiskey, “What my customers say to me, stays with me.” 

Sara smiled as the glass slid her way. 

“Though I don’t recall seeing you during other birthdays, issues?” Pete asked.

“My father-in-law is demanding I take my great contributions to mankind and turn them into a quick buck,” Sara sighed, “David is half on his side but…” she shook her head, “There’s more to life than money, you know?”

“I find that folks who say that tend to have more than enough money,” Pete quipped.

“Yes,” Sara said with a smile, “and I have plenty.  I don’t need more.” Sara took a heavy sip, “Mmm.. top shelf Pete?”

“Hey, Happy Birthday,” Pete said, “On the house.”

“Aww, thanks Pete,” Sara said as she glanced up at the TV.

On the screen was Grand General Zepherina, commander of Penthasil’s armed forces, as well as the defacto ruler of the entire Penthasilian Empire, which, sans some large portions of Asia, ruled most of the civilized world.

“Oh, great… Wonder what she’s on about now?” Sara sighed.

“Oh, you didn’t hear?” Pete said, turning the volume up, “Big announcement.”

Zepherina’s voice was unmuted as she spoke to a large crowd.  “It’s been several years since the demonic incursion and I know that we all lost a lot. But I’m proud to say, with the efforts of our esteemed soldiers, the cooperation of our religious leaders, and the diligence of every citizen of the Empire, we can finally declare the war against the demonic forces, over!”

Sara sipped her coffee, “and here I thought she was going to hold onto power indefinitely.”

Pete chuckled, “Oh yeah.  Like we had it so good before she showed up, right?”

Sara glanced at Pete, “I do recall voting…”

“Mhmm, and that did us so good, didn’t it?” Pete chuckled.

Sara took another sip of her coffee, glancing up to the screen.

“As the war is over, so is the Martial Law I imposed, under authority of my Mom, Empress Ranga, forever Her soul rests in power,” Zepherina paused.

Pete whispered, “*Forever Her soul rests in power.”*

Sara frowned, turning back to the TV. 

“With the end of Martial Law, comes the return of your local elections and the restoration of statehood for many of the Empire’s Nation States,” Zepherina announced.

“Heh, guess we get voting back after-all,” Pete chuckled.

Sara sipped her coffee, “*Yeah.  With General Zepherina always at the top,”* she thought to herself.

“I am sure all of you expected this announcement,” Zepherina continued, “What I announce now is that I am abdicating my rightful claim to the throne.”

Sara nearly spat out her Irish Coffee.

“The fuck?!” Pete shouted, looking intently at the screen.

“She’s stepping *down?!”* Sara said, now interested in the announcement.

The crowd was just as flabbergasted.

Zepherina lifted her gauntlet clad hand to silence the crowd.  “I am a General and I plan to remain one henceforth. As such, I do not believe my time as the leader of our armed forces will translate properly to managing the Nation States in peacetime.  That is why, from this day forward, Princess Lucilla Hyppolite, my sister, will be crowned as your new Empress of the Penthasilian Empire.” 

Sara scoffed, “Oh like that’s *so* much better.”

Pete barely paid much attention to Sara as Zepherina made way for a smaller, by comparison, woman.

She stood slightly over 185cm tall, had long red hair, and similar violet eyes.  Her eyes seemed to have a defined glow to them, her angelic wings were black, with white fringes along the edge.  

Zepherina hugged Lucilia, and stepped away from the podium. 

“She’s like… What… 16?” Pete asked out loud.  “Maybe 18? I can’t remember…”

Sara frowned, “Doesn’t matter.  Doesn’t change anything.”

“I think it does,” Pete said as the TV continued.

Lucilia’s voice carried outward, “I know that maybe I am new to you. Apart from my relationship to my sister General Zepherina Hyppolite. You know *her* great work protecting this grand Empire, and our entire world, but little of me.”

Sara looked down at her drink, her eyes moving to Pete as he watched the announcement with rapt attention. 

Lucilia continued, “I want to express that General Zepherina will continue to protect us all, that I will be here to manage your matters of state. I will facilitate the elections of your local representatives, the formations of your parliaments and senates, as well as-”

“Turn it off, Pete,” Sara asked, agitation clearly in her voice.

Pete muted it, keeping the captions on the TV, “Eh, it’s not so bad.”

“Mmhmm,” Sara took another sip of her coffee, “It isn’t until someone comes into power who is.”

Pete rolled his eyes, “Yeah, Yeah,” he headed to the other side of the bar.

Sara stared at the coffee cup, looking at herself in the reflection of the liquid.

That’s when a smooth voice chimed in from over her shoulder, “Something troubling you, young lady?”

Sara turned to spot a man in a white suit, an old style hat, and striking amber eyes.  He smiled broadly at her.

“I did catch your name, but I feel it’s rude to not properly introduce oneself,” He grinned, “Benjamin Leibel is the name.” 

“Sara,” Sara said shortly.

“I know,” Benjamin grinned wide, “I overhead.”

“Mhmm,” Sara said, taking another sip, “So, I’m married, though I doubt you’re hitting on me.”

Benjamin gave a haughty laugh and sat at the stool next to her.  “Nothing of the sort, not that I’m disparaging you. I mean, you can’t help the body you’re born into,” He chuckled, “Well, *Normally.”*

“Normally?” Sara asked.

“Mmm,” Benjamin smiled at her, “I have a proposal for you Sara, and I’m certain you’d be interested.” Benjamin slid a glass of water to Sara. 

Sara glanced at the water glass suspiciously, “So, I have a drink, thanks.”

Benjamin grinned, and tapped the glass, the water turning to red wine, “I’m an angel, Sara.  Not like the Royal family.  *I* can perform miracles.  I want to perform one for you, you see.  To help you.”

Sara looked at the glass, picking it up and sniffing it. 

It was wine.

“So, if you’re an angel, where were you when all Hell literally broke loose?” Sara questioned.

“Oh, Sara,” Benjamin chuckled, “The war? I was busy fighting! But all that’s over.  Now I just want to get back to doing the work I was doing before the war.”

“What work would that be?” Sara questioned.

“Well,” Benjamin snapped his fingers, a scroll appearing in his hand, “Helping people achieve what they couldn’t before.  I could make your legs work, and even fix your vision.  Make you whole again, Sara.  All I ask is a stake,” He grinned a million watt smile, “in *you*.  So to speak.”

Sara glanced at the paper, took a heavy swig of her coffee, and spat it out on the contract.

Benjamin shot up from his seat, shocked.

“Fuck off, yah prick,” Sara said as she pushed herself from the stool, and onto her wheelchair, “Later, Pete!”

As Sara rolled out the door, Benjamin, better known as Belial, the former Demon of Flesh and Lord of Lust, grinned at Sara as she left, “Well well well… Little Sara still has some bite to her,” he grinned wickedly, “I’ll find a way to get you yet, Sara Baker.”

“I bet you will,” a voice chimed in behind Belial.

Belial turned to see a woman with long blonde hair, dressed in all black.  She wore fishnets, a pair of calf high boots, with her nails painted black.  She had a tattoo of a golden apple on her shoulder.

The woman stood, lithe and petite, and mostly unassuming.  Her build was thin, far from frail, but her face did appear as if she had been malnourished.  To most, she would appear as a beautifully thin young woman, maybe in her late 20s. 

To Belial, he could see there was something far more to her as he looked her over, “...and you are?”

“Your new best friend,” the mysterious woman gave Belial a warm smile, “You’re kind of special having survived *the wall* and all.”

Belial lifted an eyebrow, and grinned, “I have my ways.”

“Things are *boring*,” the blonde woman said in an exasperated tone as she stood up, “Really boring,” she grinned, “but *you* seem to me to be the kind of person who I could count on to stir things up.”

Belial chuckled, “What ever gave you that idea?”

“Pft,” the blonde grinned, “you used the same fake name that you did with Fred.”

Belial’s smile faded slightly.

“*Belial,”* the blonde whispered.

“You know me, and far more than most do in the world,” Belial whispered, “Yet I don’t know you. You are…?”

The blonde woman giggled softly, “Oh, just someone who *hates* when things are boring and predictable,” she shrugged, “What’s fun about the world if there isn’t just a little bit of,” Her eyes flashed with a devious energy, “**Chaos.”**",8,1740703996.0,The_Guardian_Temple,3,1.0,False

ALAN RUSSELL

They found the bodies on Sunday.

I heard about it before I even saw the papers, before the whispers started rolling through town like a slow-moving sickness, twisting their way through the streets, through the diners, through the school hallways. News like that doesn’t spread. It seeps, like blood through fabric. By the time the sun had fully risen, everyone knew.

By noon, the story was already set in stone.

Kevin and Don, drunk or high or both, had wandered out to the train tracks in the dead of night, draped themselves in a tarp, and fallen into such a deep, careless sleep that they hadn’t woken up when a thousand-ton train came bearing down on them at sixty miles an hour.

By evening, their names were cautionary tales, spoken in hushed, disapproving tones.

By Monday morning, they were just another small-town tragedy, another set of parents left burying their sons, another gruesome accident that no one wanted to think too hard about.


The conductor had seen them first, lying just past the junction outside of town, a few miles down the old freight line where the rust crept up the rails and weeds poked through the gravel. The tarp covering them was blue, weathered by the elements, barely distinguishable from the ground in the dark.

At first, he thought it was debris, a bundle of junk left behind by drifters or careless hunters. But as he got closer, the shape became clearer, more deliberate—two forms beneath the fabric, motionless, long limbs sprawled awkwardly over the steel rails.

He hit the horn. They didn’t move.

He threw the brakes. The train didn’t stop.

It took nearly a mile for it to slow, for the screeching metal to finally drag to a halt, but by then, it was too late.

By then, the bodies had already been torn apart, scattered across the tracks in dark, wet ribbons, pieces flung into the grass, into the gravel, into the deep ditches lining the junction like open graves.

The crew searched the scene with grim, reluctant hands, collecting what was left of Kevin’s arms, Don’s ribs, fragments of skull and torn fabric, piecing them together like a grotesque puzzle. That’s when they noticed that the blood wasn’t red. It was thick and purple, clotted like syrup, far too viscous, soaking into the ground in sluggish, gelatinous pools.

Any doctor, any forensic pathologist, any damn coroner with half a brain could tell you what that meant.

By the time the steel wheels tore through the bodies, splitting flesh from bone, scattering viscera across the tracks, they had already been dead.

I wasn’t a doctor. Neither was Mac or Heather. None of us had the medical knowledge to stand in that morgue and tell them they were full of shit, to point at the viscous, purple blood pooling in the plastic bags and tell them that people don’t die like that.

The medical examiner—Dr. Yasin Halak, a man who had been working in Ashwood longer than I had been alive, longer than my mother had lived here—gave the official cause of death at noon.

The boys had gone hunting, as they often did, but this time, they had gotten reckless. They had gotten stoned off their asses on “the dreaded marijuana,” lost track of time, lost track of their minds, stumbled onto the train tracks, and, for some unfathomable reason, pulled a tarp over themselves and passed out cold, dead to the world.

So dead, apparently, that a roaring freight train had not been enough to stir them from their sleep.

So dead that they hadn’t moved when the engine bore down on them, hadn’t twitched when the horn blared, hadn’t so much as shifted when the wheels finally met flesh.

Halak stood at that podium, in front of the whole town, and said this with a straight face.

Like Don, who had spent half his life handling firearms, tracking animals, surviving in the woods, would’ve decided to just fall asleep on the goddamn train tracks after smoking a little weed.

Like Kevin, who had been the lightest lightweight I had ever known, who never got high when we went night spotting because he was too paranoid about making a mistake, would have just let it happen.

He said it like it was reasonable, like it made sense, like we were all supposed to just accept it and move on.

And the worst part?

Most people did.


Don’s mother stood stone-faced at the service, her grief too deep to bend into words, her bodies too hollowed out to hold onto anything but the weight of loss. Don’s brothers, Nathan, Oliver, and little Sam sat behind her, shaky-legged and confused. Oliver and Sam were young, too young to understand that Don wasn’t coming home, tugging Nathan’s sleeve, asking if they could go to the catering table—and Nathan was too young to look as old as he did, the lines of loss etching themselves deep into the twelve-year old’s youthful face. He looked more like Don every day.

Kevin’s father was hit the hardest. He stood for the entire service, eyes firmly locked on the coffin of the last member of his family, silent tears streaming down the practiced iron face of a United States Marine. It occurred to me that this was the first time I had ever seen him without a bottle in his hand, something he explained when he gave his eulogy.

“I-I could have been a better father. Coming back, I wasn’t ready, I turned to the bottle to… try to deal with it. Kevin-Kevin looked up to me like you wouldn’t believe, thought I was a hero, and I let him down. Everyday. Watching his little face fall was worse than anything I ever had to do over there. But I… didn’t change and I guess he tried to deal with it the only way he knew—the way I did. If… if that shit did that to my boy, I’m never touching a drop of it again, memories be damned.”

After he walked off the stage with the brisk steps of a broken soldier, they brought up a bunch of Kevin and Don’s old teachers and classmates. We sat in the church pews, listening to people who had never really known them talk about them like they had, feeling our teeth press into our tongues as we tried to hold back the things we really wanted to say.

That it wasn’t their fault.

That they hadn’t died like that.

The town had already cried for them, for the boys they thought they knew. For the cautionary tale they had turned them into.

Kevin and Don, the reckless, foolish kids who had thrown their lives away in a haze of smoke and bad decisions, who had been claimed by the same stupid vices that had claimed a hundred others before them.

They didn’t get to be the boys we knew. They didn’t get to be smart, or funny, or stupid in the way that made life fun instead of tragic.

They didn’t get to be people anymore.

They were just a story now, another cautionary tale, another lesson to scare the younger kids straight, a tragedy they could shake their heads at over coffee, muttering about how they had thrown their lives away over drugs and bad decisions.


We should have said something.

We should have stood up, right there in that church, and screamed the truth at the top of our lungs, that their bodies had been dumped there, left like garbage on the tracks to be found.

But we didn’t.

Mac’s hands hadn’t stopped shaking since the moment we’d walked in. Heather hadn’t looked up from her lap. I sat there, gripping Kevin’s old lighter so tightly it left an indent in my palm, staring at the polished caskets at the front of the room, knowing—no one was in them. Not really, not the way they had been. The pieces of them had been collected. Put back together as best they could be.

But the real Don, the real Kevin—they had been gone long before that train hit them. 

I sure as hell didn’t trust the police, not after what we had seen. I knew better than to walk into that station and ask questions, but I needed to know, now more than ever.

I had other leads, people who might have been willing to talk if they thought I was the only one listening.

Greg O’Neal had told me to wait for his call. I had been waiting ever since.

Now, with Kevin and Don buried beneath the dirt, I wasn’t waiting anymore.

That night, after the funeral, after the murmured condolences, after Mac had punched a hole in the wall of my garage and Heather had sobbed into my shoulder for hours, I grabbed my father’s gun and I went looking for answers.




HEATHER ROBINSON


Alan held me like he knew I might break.

Like if he let go, I would crumble to pieces, scatter at his feet like shattered glass, slip between the cracks in the floor and disappear completely. I pressed my face into his shoulder, breathing in the scent of wood smoke and old leather, my fingers clutching at the fabric of his jacket, digging in like I could hold myself together by holding onto him.

The grief didn’t come all at once.

It bled in slow, crawling waves, filling the spaces between my ribs, creeping up my throat, pooling behind my eyes. I didn’t cry at first—just stood there, trembling, silent, too hollowed out to process the depth of what I had lost.

And then it hit me, all at once, like a tidal wave crashing over a broken levy.

Kevin was gone.

Don was gone.

The weight of those words pressed down on me, crushed me, swallowed me whole.

I broke and Alan let me.

There were no more stupid inside jokes, no more late-night drives, no more drunken confessions whispered between cigarette drags, no more Don rolling his eyes and Kevin making some sarcastic quip to lighten the mood.

There was just this hole, this sickening, gaping wound that had opened inside my chest, something I could never fill again.

And it hurt.

God, it hurt.

I don’t know how long I cried, but Alan didn’t let go. He just stood there, holding me up, like he knew I couldn’t stand on my own anymore.



I left shortly after, still dizzy with grief, still raw, like my insides had been scraped out and left in the dirt beside their caskets.

The wind was cold as I walked, cutting through the thin fabric of my dress, stinging my skin. I kept my arms wrapped tightly around myself, head down, feet moving automatically over the familiar road that led toward home. The pavement stretched ahead of me in long, jagged cracks, veins splitting through the asphalt like the town itself was coming apart.

Then, a sound—the low, slow roll of tires creeping up beside me.

The glow of headlights crawled along the street, reaching for my shadow, stretching it long and thin against the ground.

I knew who it was before he spoke.

“Hey.”

Trevor’s voice was too casual, too normal, like he was greeting me in the school parking lot instead of pulling up beside me on the way home from my dead friends’ funeral.

I kept walking.

The truck slowed, keeping pace with me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked, genuinely confused, like he didn’t already know, like he hadn’t been somewhere else, anywhere else, instead of sitting next to me in that church pew.

My hands curled into fists.

A sharp, bitter laugh pushed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, clenched my jaw, forced myself to breathe. I turned my head just enough to see his face, to take in the way he tilted his head in mild confusion, unbothered, unaffected, like he had never known them, never known me.

Something inside me cracked.

And I realized, with startling, suffocating clarity—

I hated him.

I hated his detachment, his self-importance, the way he could so effortlessly pretend that nothing had changed. I hated the fact that he hadn’t been there, hadn’t thought to call, hadn’t thought to ask if I was okay until I was walking alone in the dark with grief bleeding out of me in short, sharp, arterial bursts.

I turned back.

Kept walking.

“Hey—Heather.” His voice tightened, just a little, that edge of frustration creeping in. “Come on, don’t be like that.”

His car sped up for a second, pulling ahead, then slowed again, the tires grinding against the pavement.

I didn’t look at him. Didn’t stop. Didn’t care how pissed he was. I just walked, straight to my house, straight inside and slammed the door shut behind me.

I didn’t turn on the lights.

Just peeled off my dress, kicked off my shoes, crawled under the covers, and stared at the ceiling. But something felt… off.

It was subtle at first, just a tickle at the back of my skull, something I couldn’t place.

The air in the room was too thick, too heavy, pressing down on my skin like a damp cloth. The silence was too deep, stretched tight like a wire, like it was just waiting to snap.

I turned onto my side.

Told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, grieving, paranoid.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.




I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not my own.

Not… human.

Something slow. Something measured. Something wet.

The air in my room was thick with it, damp and unnatural, each inhale slow, rattling, wet, like something sucking air through hollowed-out bone. The sound slithered over my skin, pressing into my ears, crawling down my throat like smoke, pooling in my lungs like a second presence, something inside me, something breathing with me.

I tried to move.

I couldn’t.

A weight pinned me down, crushing my chest into the mattress, pressing my arms into my sides, my muscles locked into place like I had been buried alive.

I could feel it.

Something was sitting on me, pinning me to the mattress, pressing my body down into the sheets with deliberate cruelty, allowing me just enough breath to stay awake, to keep struggling, to remain trapped in the moment where waking turned to nightmare and nightmare turned to something worse.

My skin crawled, the back of my neck prickling like when I was a child, when I used to lie awake at night, convinced something was waiting in the closet, beneath my bed, just out of sight.

I wasn’t wrong back then.

I wasn’t wrong now.

And if I looked, if I let my gaze slip toward the darkness pooling in the corners of my bedroom, toward the places where my childhood nightmares had always waited for me, if I dared to look too closely—

I would see the others, too.





The closet door was open.

I didn’t remember leaving it open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

But now, in the suffocating dark, it had cracked just enough to reveal the narrow stretch of empty floor, the space between my hanging clothes, the place where I used to imagine glowing eyes blinking back at me from the void.

Something moved inside.

It was not solid, not a figure, not a shape, but rather the absence of a shape, an unraveling of reality, thick and black as ink, shifting in the dim light, pulsing, the suggestion of a form flickering in and out of existence.

Then—

The tips of black, razor-sharp claws curled around the edge of the doorframe, sinking into the wood.

It was steadying itself.

It had been waiting for me to notice.

A horrible, slow shudder rippled through the dark, and then it leaned forward, just slightly, just enough to be sure I knew—

It was looking at me.

The air grew colder, pressing into my ears, my ribs, my throat. I could feel the sheets beneath me, feel the mattress at my back—

And then, I felt something shift below me, a gentle, almost playful movement.

A pressure pressing up into my spine. Something was beneath the bed.

I had been afraid of this, once—when I was four, five, six years old, lying awake at night, legs curled up so they wouldn’t dangle over the side, so nothing could grab me, yank me down, pull me under.

I wasn’t four years old anymore, but I had never been more convinced that if I set one foot on the floor, I would be dragged into something I wouldn’t return from.

The breathing was closer now, curling over the mattress from all directions, seeping from the floorboards, from the corners of the room, from the spaces where darkness stretched too deep, where it pooled in places it had no right to be.

The creaking started, slow and deliberate, my headboard shaking ever so slightly. 

I couldn’t see past the edge of my mattress, but I felt it moving, shifting its weight from one foot to the other, measured, careful, like it didn’t want to wake me up.

It was closer than the first one, too close.

The stench of smoke and rotting meat filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, sinking into my skin, curling against my tongue.

It moved again. It was not solid, not completely.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye, a shape unraveling, folding into itself, shifting like liquid shadow, like a cloud of black ink spilled across water, its outline flickering in and out of reality, its presence undeniable even when it disappeared completely.

It was watching me.

It was hovering over me.

I could feel it leaning in, face hovering inches from mine, breath curling hot and damp against my cheek.

The smell of blood was thick in the air.

Something in the closet shifted again, fingers tightening around the wood, the unseen weight on my chest growing heavier, heavier, heavier, the edges of my vision dimming.

And suddenly I was back in middle school.

Mr. Corbin had fallen in a twisted heap of broken limbs and fabric, like something that had been dropped rather than collapsed, his fingers still curled into the fabric of his slacks, his back arched unnaturally, as if the bullet had locked him into place.

I had stared at him, unable to reconcile the shape of his body with the shape of the man he had been, watching as the blood crawled between the tiles, as thick and slow and endless as the River Lethe.

I had squeezed my eyes shut then, trying to pretend it wasn’t real, trying to pretend I wasn’t seeing it, that if I stopped looking, it would stop existing.

It hadn’t worked then, it wouldn’t work now.

Because I could still see him, could still see the way his mouth had fallen open, lips twisted in a way that no longer belonged to him, his face empty, hollow, frozen in the moment when he realized he was about to die.

And something in the darkness—something woven from inky black smoke and elongated limbs—laughed.

The weight on my chest never lessened, but I could feel a new presence, a new shape pressing into the mattress at my back, something curling itself around my spine, winding through my ribs like ivy, seeping into the spaces where I had long since stopped believing anything holy remained.

Its fingers trailed lightly over the skin of my neck, feather-light, tender, almost affectionate.

And then—a sound above me, a slow, wet clicking.

I had always been afraid of this, the idea that something could perch on the headboard of my bed, looking down at me while I slept, curling its claws into the wood, waiting for me to wake up so I could see it.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t—

It was not solid, not fully formed, an unraveling thing, shifting between states, visible and not, present and not, real and not, a creature made of ink and shadow, pouring through my bed frame, coiling beneath my sheets, wrapping its tendrils around my wrists like bracelets made of bone.

Something sharp pressed into my wrists. A long, curved raven’s talon, curling against my pulse, tracing the delicate, vulnerable stretch of skin, where my veins rose close to the surface.

And then, with a slow, deliberate pressure, it sank into my wrists.

Pain erupted in twin streaks of fire, sharp and hot, sending a bolt of electricity up my arms, every nerve ending screaming at once. My vision blurred, my breath ripped from my lungs in a silent, shuddering gasp.

Something wet dripped down my arms. The thing above me pressed closer, whispering something I couldn’t understand, something too old and too heavy and too broken for human ears.

And then—I woke up.

Jerking violently, gasping for air, hands flying to my wrists, breath shattering in my throat as I ran my fingers over the skin that should have been smooth, should have been whole.

It wasn’t.

Two long, deep scratches ran the length of my wrists, carved into my flesh like a signature welling with blood.

The closet door was still open. The room was as still as a mausoleum.

And in the shadows where my nightmares had always lived—

Something breathed, waiting for me to sleep again.



ALAN RUSSELL

I found Greg O’Neal’s address the old-fashioned way—sifting through old phone books, talking to the right people, using my fake id to pay for a couple of drinks at Callahan’s, and finally, after piecing together information like a puzzle made of half-rotted scraps, I had an address.

It sat in a part of town that felt like it had been forgotten on purpose, a place where the paint peeled faster than people could afford to cover it up, where the sidewalks were cracked and buckling, where the streetlights burned too dim or not at all.

By the time I pulled up, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon, a pale slit of dull pink light barely strong enough to push through the lingering night.

I should have been the first one there, but I wasn’t.

Two Dodge Polaras sat parked in front of the house, their red and blue lights casting eerie pulses across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the strips of yellow crime scene tape that flapped lazily in the early morning breeze.

And the front door—the front door was wide open.

I killed the engine and slid out of my truck, pulling my jacket tighter around myself as I made my way up the cracked sidewalk, shoulders tense, jaw clenched, the Tokarev TT-33 resting like a quiet promise beneath the layers of fabric, the metal icy cold against my skin.

I really needed to buy a holster.

The air reeked of something sour, something rotten, a stench so thick it made the back of my throat tighten. I had smelled blood before, smelled bodies left too long in places they weren’t supposed to be, but this was something different. Something worse.

The stink curled into my nostrils, settled into my lungs, and as I stepped closer, I saw it. Just past the officers standing at the door, past the flickering glow of cheap overhead bulbs, just barely visible through the open doorway—a corpse, sitting upright.

Headless.

One of the officers swiveled around, turning towards me before I could get any closer.

“Crime scene’s closed.”

I pulled my hands from my jacket pockets, raising them in an easy, slow-moving gesture. “Didn’t know there was a crime scene, officer.”

His eyes narrowed. “Then why are you here?”

I let my expression stay neutral, ignoring the tight coil of unease winding its way up my spine.

“Friend of a friend told me Greg O’Neal lived here. Haven’t heard from him in a few days.”

The other officer—younger, thinner, the kind of guy who still looked nervous when he put on the badge in the morning—shifted uncomfortably before speaking.

“Yeah, well. You won’t be hearing from him now.”

I didn’t ask what’d happened, I didn’t have to. I had already seen enough.

But the first officer—the older one, built like a brick wall, with eyes that looked like they had seen a thousand things no man should ever see—decided I should hear it anyway.

“Neighbor called it in,” he said, voice gruff, tired, the tone of a man who had been awake too long and had seen too much. “Said the smell was leaking out onto the street. We get here, we knock, we get no answer. We step inside, and there he is. Melting into the goddamn couch.”

His lip curled slightly, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered disgust in his eyes, the thing he was trying to swallow down, bury, forget.

“The top half of him, anyway.”

I didn’t ask where the head was.

They didn’t know, or maybe they did, and they didn’t want to say it out loud. I had seen enough strange things to know that some wounds didn’t bleed the way they were supposed to, that some deaths weren’t meant to be neatly written down in a coroner’s report.

Something felt wrong about this, though. Not just the body, not just the missing head. The house itself was too quiet, not the kind of quiet that came from an empty building, but the kind of quiet that came from something waiting, something watching, something pressing against the walls just beneath the surface, curling its fingers into the floorboards, stretching through the drywall.

Something had happened here and whatever it was—it hadn’t left.

I was about to turn back when the dog came out.

The first thing I noticed was the blood.

It was matted into its fur, dried and crusted in dark, jagged streaks, caking the white of its paws, staining the gray of its snout. It snarled and thrashed, teeth bared, foam bubbling at the edges of its mouth, the leash wrapped tight around the wrist of one of the officers as he struggled to drag the animal toward the car.

“Son of a bitch hasn’t let anyone near him since we got here,” the younger officer muttered, keeping his distance.

“Wouldn’t either, if I’d been locked in here for days with a corpse.”

I watched as they forced the dog into the backseat of one of the Dodge Polaras, the metal door slamming shut behind it.

It kept snarling, snapping, eyes wild, like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to attack or run or rip the whole goddamn world apart.

Something about it didn’t sit right.

Dogs mourned, dogs starved, dogs howled and whimpered and shrank beneath the weight of grief and loneliness.

But this?

This dog was angry.

And for some reason, that scared me more than the body.

I had come looking for answers.

Instead, I had found a corpse with no head, a house that smelled like death, and a dog that had seen something no living being could understand.

I had nothing.

No leads. No direction. No next move.

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, turning back toward my truck, keeping my eyes on the cracked pavement as I walked, forcing myself not to look back at the house, not to let my mind pick apart the way the door still stood open, how the shadows inside seemed darker than they should have been, deeper than they should have been.

I climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life beneath my hands. I sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, staring at my own reflection in the windshield, watching the red and blue lights flicker over my skin.

I needed a holster, I needed a plan, and most of all—

I needed to know what the hell had happened to Greg O’Neal.


The night was thick with humidity, the air clinging to my skin like a second layer. Greg O’Neal’s house stood ahead, dark and hollow, abandoned in the wake of his murder. The yellow police tape still fluttered against the porch railing, curling at the edges, but no one was watching this place anymore.

I stepped over the tape, my boots hitting the wooden steps with a soft creak. The door was still open—just enough for me to slip inside. The stench hit me immediately, thick and rotten, the kind of smell that burrows into your sinuses and lingers. Death. Even after they’d taken the body, scrubbed the floors, it still sat heavy in the air.

I pulled the collar of my jacket up, breathing through my mouth as I moved through the small living room. The furniture was cheap and well-worn, a sagging couch pushed against the wall, a stained recliner in the corner. A coffee table sat between them, littered with old magazines, cigarette butts, and a ring of dried blood where something—someone—had sat.

I crouched down, examining the dried stain. Greg had been dead for days before they found him, his dog half-starved by the door. There were things here that didn’t add up, and I wasn’t leaving without answers.

I moved toward the back of the house, careful not to disturb anything. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, the hinges groaning as I pushed it open. The bed was unmade, sheets still tangled, like someone had been in a hurry. A dresser stood against the far wall, drawers hanging open, empty. Someone had been here before me.

I stepped closer, my eyes catching on something wedged between the dresser and the wall. A scrap of paper, folded and creased. I crouched, pulling it free, unfolding it with careful fingers. The ink was smudged, but I could still make out the words.

PETERSON COMP STA #12—01:30

A date was scrawled beneath it, a week before Greg was found dead. I stared at it for a long moment, my pulse thrumming in my ears. He had known something. He’d gone out there for a reason, and whatever he’d found had cost him his life.

My pulse jumped as I heard a noise, soft, barely there, but enough to send a prickle down my spine. I turned sharply, scanning the darkened doorway. The house settled around me, the wind whispering through the open front door. There was nothing, only my nerves. I exhaled slowly, tucking the paper into my pocket before moving back toward the living room. I needed to check the kitchen, see if Greg had left anything behind—notes, receipts, anything.

I barely made it two steps before something slammed into the side of my jaw.

Pain exploded through my skull, bright and searing. My vision blurred, my knees buckling as I staggered, catching myself against the wall. Another hit—this one harder. My head snapped to the side, stars bursting behind my eyes, my body giving out beneath me.

The floor rushed up to meet me.

Then there was nothing.


I woke up in a jail cell that smelled like sweat, old paper, and the sharp, metallic tang of dried blood—the kind you don’t notice at first, but lingers beneath the surface, clinging to the air, waiting to be acknowledged. I sat up on the edge of my cot, elbows resting on my knees, watching the bars in front of me with the kind of measured patience that only came when you knew no one was coming to help you.

The silence pressed against me, thick and unmoving, broken only by the steady ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands moving with the slow, mechanical certainty of something that had seen more men wait out long nights than I could ever count. I rubbed my jaw, feeling the faint bruise forming there, and exhaled through my nose.

Then came the footsteps, boots against linoleum, the shift of a belt, the soft jingle of keys tapping against metal. I just listened as they came closer, as they stopped just beyond the bars, as a familiar weight settled into the air like a hand pressing firm against the back of my neck.

I finally lifted my gaze. Wilkes was standing there, one hand on his belt, the other holding a paper cup, steam curling from its rim. The old man took a slow sip of coffee, then let out a long sigh, shaking his head. ""Hell of a mess you got yourself in.""
For a second, just a second, it felt like being twelve again.

Like I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, listening to him spin stories about Samson and his jawbone, about David and his sling, about all the times when God didn’t spare the sinners, when the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole, when fire rained from the sky and turned entire cities to dust.

The stories they never told in church, but that he was always eager to share, delighting in the details.

“You’re real lucky, though,” Wilkes said, taking a slow sip of coffee. “If it were anybody else, they might’ve decided to charge you with something a little more serious than a night in jail.”

I snorted, rolling my shoulders. “On what, trespassing?”

Wilkes hummed, shifting his head slightly. “Could’ve been breaking and entering. Maybe even attempted burglary, if they were feelin’ mean about it.”

I tilted my head slightly, glancing at the bars between us. ""You know I had to try and find out what happened.""

Something flickered in Wilkes’ face, but it was gone before I could name it. The sheriff sighed, a deep, weary sound, and leaned back in his chair, rubbing a hand over his face like a man who had spent too many nights awake, watching over something he couldn’t protect.

“You’re reckless, son,” Wilkes said finally, his voice lower now, not scolding, but something else. Something softer. “You run around this town kicking up dust, looking under rocks that oughta stay put, and one day, you’re gonna find something you wish you hadn’t.”

I raised one weary eyebrow. “You worried about me, Sheriff?”

Wilkes exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “Course I am.” He looked down at the desk, tapping one finger against the wood. “Watched you grow up. Watched all of you grow up. And now I’m sittin’ here, wonderin’ if I’m about to watch you throw yourself headfirst into something you can’t come back from.”

I looked down at the cracks in the concrete floor of the cell, thinking it over.

“You ever read Ezekiel 31, Sheriff?”

Wilkes' eyes flicked up, just for a second.

I took that as my answer.

""Talks about shepherds,"" I continued, my voice steady. ""The ones who do right, and the ones who don’t. How the Lord gets mighty pissed at the ones who fatten themselves on the flock, who trample the pasture, who leave the lambs scattered, hungry, lost.""

Wilkes exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. ""You always did have a memory for scripture.""

I smiled faintly. ""Got it from you, Sheriff.""

Wilkes sat there, watching me, unmoving, unreadable.

""My father was a carpenter,"" I said. ""Built everything we ever had with his own two hands. Didn’t have much growing up, but I had him. And he wasn’t perfect. But he worked, and he prayed, and he tried—tried his damnedest—to be a good man. A better man than his father was.""

I took a deep breath, pausing for a minute.

""I keep thinking about that, lately. About what it means to be good. About what it means to stand in the light of the Lord and walk in the path of the righteous man.""

Wilkes’ fingers stilled against the cup, his jaw tightening slightly.

""See, I used to think it was simple. I used to think there were good men and there were bad men, and all you had to do was be good."" I let out a breath, shaking my head slightly. ""But it ain’t that simple, is it? Nah, the world don’t work that way.""

Wilkes didn’t say a word. I looked at him then, really looked at him—the lines in his face deeper than he remembered, his shoulders not quite as squared as they used to be. I thought of all the years Wilkes had spent keeping this town in order, all the weight he carried.

""It’s hard to be good,"" I said. ""Hard to stand in a place like this and tell yourself you’re still walking the righteous path. Cain thought he could walk it. Abel did too. But the first story of man is the story of one man killing another. The first time blood ever touched the earth.""

Wilkes’ expression didn’t change, but something in his posture shifted, just slightly.
I leaned forward, resting my forearms on my knees.

""Every man’s got a choice,"" I murmured. ""To be the shepherd, or to be the sinner. To raise his hand, or to keep it by his side.""

I swallowed hard.

“And I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.”

Wilkes’s fingers tapped against his desk, slow, rhythmic, thoughtful. Then, finally, he spoke.

""I know you are,"" he said, voice steady. ""And that’s what worries me.""

Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. Then Wilkes let out a long breath, stood, and walked over to the cell. He pulled out the key, turned it in the lock with a soft, metallic click.

He stood, slowly and deliberately, walked on over, and unlocked the cell door.
“Mac paid your bail.”

He didn’t look at me as I stepped past him, moving toward the open door, toward the first breath of morning air spilling into the station.

But as I reached the threshold, the light cutting across my face, I heard Wilkes sigh quietly, almost resignedly. 

“Just go home, Alan.”
