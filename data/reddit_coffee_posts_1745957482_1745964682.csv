First ever attempt of actaully putting my ideas on paper. If you read this, could you be kind enough to leave some kind of feedback? I wanna know if it's good and how I can improve as a writer. 

Chapter 1

Kurt sat back in the cool leather chair and brought the coffee cup to his lips, taking a slow, long drink. He smacked his lips and sat it back down in the cupholder. His radio buzzed with chatter about this and that, but he wasn't listening. He was focused. His sharp blue eyes traced every car that passed him. The overhead road lights came on and he backed his cruiser even further into the shadows. He was upset. For the last three years on the job he had given no less than one hundred tickets a year. This year he had only 92, and December was almost over. I'll make it. I still have time. He took another sip before turning off his radio. Illegal, I know, he thought. But who's gonna see? He stroked his brown mustache. He thought it was coming along well but he needed to keep putting on that hair grower. His cousin had pointed him in its direction, and he was pleased to say it was working well. He shifted his black uniform and his eyes drifted towards the LED clock on his console. 12:13 PM. his shift would end soon.
As he looked up a red streak flashed across his vision and he heard the beep of his radar. He glanced at it with increasing interest and he saw it was 127 MPH. giddy with delight he put his car into gear and turned on the sirens. He raced after the car. 93, here I come. He followed the car, which he saw was a red Subaru, for a solid five minutes before he pulled up beside it and called out his window. “Pull over now!” he shouted as he struggled to keep up speed. The car instantly stopped without so much as a second's hesitation and calmly pulled over to the side of the road. Kurt slammed on his brakes and his car made an unpleasant noise as he turned around and pulled behind the subaru. How the hell did it stop so fast? Kurt thought with confusion as he opened the cruiser door and slammed it behind him. He walked up to the Subaru's windows and knocked on the driver's side glass. No answer. “Roll down the window.” another knock, this one forceful. No answer. He shone his flashlight on the window and saw nothing. That's one hell of a tint. He banged on the window with the butt of his flashlight while unholstering his pistol. “If you don't roll down the window, I will break it.” The window rolled down halfway before Kurt saw what was inside. He slowly lowered his light and his hand fell off the butt of the pistol. He began to sweat with terror as the window came to a stop. Inside the car was a body, naked and skinless, the only thing standing out besides the blood red muscle was the mouth. The very muscle and bone of the thing's face had somehow pulled upwards to form some expression, some hellish form of a smile. Its teeth were pure black. Blood had soaked the entire seat and everything around it. “Evening, Kurt. looking for a ninety-third?” the voice inside spoke. Kurt stuttered as his mind reeled. The car door opened and Kurt's hand flew to his pistol again, drawing it up to his shoulder. “St-stay in the car! And take off that mask!” the voice laughed, a wet, slobbery laugh the Kurt thought sounded like what a drowning boy's last breath would sound like. The door opened further and Kurt stepped back, his hand trembling too hard to aim. In his fear he noted the busy highway was completely devoid of traffic and the sky was pitch black. He was alone, truly alone. With this. As if sensing his thoughts, the voice continued to talk. “I've heard plenty of drowning boys. Drowned some myself. They don't sound like me.” it walked forward and Kurt's thoughts cleared and he heard himself let off two shots that went right through the things chest. It showed no reaction as it continued to walk forward and Kurt, now filled with pure terror, dropped the gun and ran back to his car. He grabbed at the cruiser's door and pulled, and a dull click rang out. Locked. Jesus Christ it’s locked. He heard the voice behind him. “Yes, yes it is. Did you know you wet yourself Kurt?” he felt a hand on his shoulder and he was acutely aware that he felt liquid seeping through his uniform and down his chest. “Like a little boy. A little fucking boy. You're gonna die tonight Kurt. you know that?” Kurt screamed and broke free of his grip. He ran down the highway now, only afraid, barely any sense left. He thought he looked like a rabbit being chased down by a wolf. He screamed again and sobbed, sobbed like a little boy. After what seemed like an age of running, he stopped and threw himself against the gray concrete overpass barrier and slid down onto the asphalt. Too tired to run. He began to cry again as he heard meaty thumps he knew to be the things feet. They stopped in front of him. “You can't run Kurt. you never could. Remember high school track? Kicked off the team like a little boy. A little fucking boy, Kurt.” that hand placed itself on Kurts neck and lifted him into the air. Not a tight grip, simply a little pressure. But the damn thing lifted him three feet off the ground anyway. Kurt closed his eyes. “Look at me Kurt. look at me.” Kurt shook his head and held his eyelids closed tighter. “Look at me before I rip your eyes out.” Kurt cracked one eyelid and suddenly his eyelids were forced open, some force beyond him ripping them away. He screamed as blood trickled into his eyes. The thing stepped forward until Kurt was over the edge of the barrier. He started to scream but nothing came out. The thing spoke again. “Want me to let you go, Kurt?” Kurt nodded in his dim haze of fear. He only realized his mistake a second before he hit the ground 200 feet below.

Chapter 2 “Shit.” Carl ran his hand through his sandy blond hair as he stepped away from the body. He had been police chief for eleven years and hadn't seen anything like this before. “This is the fifth damn time.” He saw something shiny in the broken heap of meat and went to pick it up. A hand casually brushed his arm away and Carl looked up to see James, the lead forensics investigator and his good friend. Carl had always been jealous of his casual attitude. James could eat whatever the hell he wanted and not gain any weight. He was three years younger than him, a solid 42, but showed no wrinkles on his chiseled face. His black wavy hair had no grey and his brown skin glowed in the sun. “You know the rules ,chief. Body has to stay untouched.” Carl chuckled nervously, his eyes glued to the body. “Sorry. Slipped my mind. So, what's the details?” James cleared his throat and began to speak. “Name is Kurt Donald, 32. He had been out waiting in a clearing by the highway stalking speeders, last we knew. His car was found parked on the side of the overpass a few hundred yards away from all this. Looked like he had pulled somebody over and something went wrong. We found a trail of blood leading from the space in front of his cruiser, must have been whoever got out of the car he stopped. It goes up to the cruiser’s driver side door and stops. It seems to pick up again right above us, and goes nowhere. Don't know how it's possible. His car was unlocked but nothing was taken, although his radio was muted. He died from the sudden impact of the ground, and his eyelids are gone.” Carl put his hands in his hair again and sighed a long, shaky sigh. “You think it's a serial killer?” James looked down at his feet and his clipboard fell to his side. “Yes. I do. Eyelids gone, trail of blood, death by falling, out late at night, everything matches the other four."" Carl felt a dampness in his chest. A year before retirement and I get hit with this shit. He walked over to his cruiser door and grabbed his radio. “All units, head back to headquarters. We need to have a discussion.” he leaned back out and slammed the door, leaning his arm across it and then his arms. He heard James get in his cruiser. Must be pretty bad if he doesn't have much to say. He stood for a second before getting back in and heading back to base.

Later

Carl walked up to the brown podium and grabbed the mike. “I'm sure by now most, if not all of you, are aware of the recent deaths of four police officers.” The crowd buzzed and Carl saw many nods. “That number as of today is five. Officer Kurt Donald of the 3rd division was found today. A detailed explanation of the nature of the crimes will be given by forensics leader James Cart. I'm here to give you an order. From now on, all forensic and any free officers will be devoted to the capture of this serial killer, who we have managed to keep from the media. Keep this quiet. Do not go on patrols past dark without a partner and you are advised to not go at all. We are aware that crime does not stop after eight, so well have our senior officers patrol in pairs. Every officer so far has been killed on the job, but we don't want to take any chances. If you go anywhere, on the clock or off it, have a firearm. For now let's all keep doing the best we can for this county. If any of you want to turn up for Kurt's funeral, it's on Sunday at six AM. I'll let James take over from here.” Carl stepped away from the mic and quickly left the meeting room, the glass door cold against his hand. He had a stomach and was sure it wasn't because he had eaten anything. The truth was despite his collected manner during his speech, he was scared. In all his years of working nothing had been quite like this. Blood trails that came from nowhere and lead to nowhere? Five officers killed, all armed, all on the job, all never calling for backup, and all dead within three months? Scary stuff. But what scared him the most wasn't the blood trail but the blood itself. They had run every sample from every trail three times, and all came back N/A. He remembered James walking in a circle in the forensics lab, his arms crossed, speaking to himself after the DNA results came in. He never spoke to himself unless something was really wrong, and that, Carl guessed as he sat down at his chestnut office desk and opened a container of Tum-Tums, was the core of his fear. James was never scared. The last time he had seen James this scared was when his wife was in the hospital with cancer three years ago. “Oh well,” Carl said to nobody in particular as he placed the Tum-Tums back in his drawer and opened his computer. “No use worrying.” he paused as the glow of his computer glowed off his badge and he looked down at his considerable stomach. His wife had been telling him for years to lay off the sweets, and he had. He felt happy again as he noticed his uniform was baggy. He’d managed to lose close to fifty pounds over the last two years, and he was losing faster, but he still wouldn't be trying out for track and field anytime soon. He loaded up his email and was about to go through it when a scrawny intern opened the door. “Somebody here to see you, sir. A reporter from Anders, that town up north."" Carl's brow furrowed. Reporter? Hadn't he kept this quiet? He grimaced. Best to get it over with if the press had found out. “Send him in.” a hand, half as large as the intern's head, plopped down on his shoulder and the intern jumped. “Didn't mean to scare ya, kid.” the intern ducked out of his grip and quickly walked off. The hand’s owner walked through the door and Carl's first impression of him was something like the incredible hulk. The man was easily six feet seven minimum, and he was as large as the door frame. He was wearing a brown detective's coat and had on a brown fedora. His face was tight, as if it was a piece of clothing too small on a body too large. When Carl thought about it later, he was almost sure that was what it was. The man smiled, and Carl saw he had no facial hair. His eyes were a striking purplish color, and his hair was as brown as his hat. He looked like a child's idea of a detective, like a costume. The man sat down in the chair in front of Carl's desk, and he thought he saw it dent under the man's weight. He stuck out his hand. “Names Anderson. And don't worry, I'm not that kind of reporter. I work for the Anders police department as an intern. We recently had an officer die like your officers. I thought I would collect details, maybe team up with your interns with your permission. Pleased to meet you regardless.” Carl shook his hand and noted his grip was firm but gentle. “Same. my name is Carl, although you probably already know that."" Anderson laughed, and for some reason Carl was afraid again. That is not a human laugh, some voice inside him said. Carl pushed the voice away. “So, what questions do you have?” Anderson shifted in his chair and spoke in a firm and gentle voice, much like his handshake. “Well for starters, I'd like to know how your staff is feeling about this. Is morale low?” Carl thought that was an odd question but answered honestly. “Morale is pretty low, but with your department's help we could catch this guy. And teaming up would give a pretty good boost.” Anderson seemed to smile wider as Carl told him about morale. Carl noticed his eyes. They were not like any eyes he had ever seen. They tracked him, always, never deviating from his own. And they seemed dead. The eyes are the window to the soul. Carl didn't know who had said that, but he did know something else. What was behind those eyes was anything but a soul.

Chapter 3 Around an hour had passed since Anderson left and Carl was very unnerved. He didn't know what to make of anderson. He had been gentle, his voice soothing, his aura one of comfort and safety. But those eyes, that skin, that way he had of speaking like a man who had just learned english while somehow talking smoothly, nothing about him made Carl feel safe. He turned his computer on again and went to the Anders police employee record. Anderson from the Anders police department. More weird shit. He typed in Anderson's first name into the record but stopped. He never told me his last name. He looked back at the screen with fear in his heart. Turns out he didn't need a last name. There wasn't, and had never been, a man named Anderson employed by the Anders police department. Carl jumped out of his seat and ran out of his office to the security room, bursting into the cold cement chamber. The lights were off and he saw the three men that had been chosen to watch the cameras that day were watching Die Hard. Carl absentmindedly thought it was a bit too late for Christmas movies. New years would be appropriate. “Get off the damn movie and run the front parking lot cameras, two hours ago. One of the men, who had red hair and was pale as chalk, ran the footage back. He set it to 1.5X speed. Carl watched. And watched. “Speed it up.” The pale man set it to 2X. Nothing. He glanced up at the camera’s time display and saw it was 2:14. Fourteen minutes after the man had first entered his office. “Run it back.” nothing. “What the fuck?” Carl said under his breath. He had them run it at three, the time Anderson had left and Carl had watched him drive off in his red subaru. Nothing again. “What the fuck?” Carl asked again, this time louder. The pale security man spoke. “Looking for something in particular, sir?” Carl nodded aggressively. “A red Subaru and a big ass dude. Impossible to miss. Are you sure these are from today?” Pale boy zoomed in on the upper corner of the footage, where the time, date, and other things always sat. Carl saw with dismay it was the right day. He thought he could feel his face going colorless. If nobody came in, and nobody came out, who the hell was in my office? In the irrational circumstances he was in, his brain was apt to find a rational explanation. So he thought for a moment. “ Has anybody come in here in the past few hours? Anyone suspicious asking to have access to the tapes?” Pale boy shook his head. “No sir. We don't let anyone in unless they get your permission. Need us to do anything else?” Carl’s head was racing. It's happening too fast, he thought absurdly. In the movies there's always a calm before the storm. Where's the calm? “No, I'm good. Thanks for your time.” Carl left before security could answer him, letting the steel door slam shut behind him. I just need rest, that's all. Some time to think everything over. He went back to his office and grabbed his things before wishing the secretaries goodbye and starting his walk home. He lived only a five minute drive away but with an uphill walk like this, it would take him a half hour to walk home. He started doing it to lose weight and he thought he could feel the calories burning away. But today he didn't feel that. As he walked home in the cool winter breeze, a cloudy sky with no snow, he thought about Anderson. I just had a conversation with a serial killer. I'm sure of that now. And the cameras… somebody on the inside has to be working with him. Why didn't I report that? My god. That man… a fucking mountian of a man and nobody saw him but me and that intern? Something's very wrong with this picture. “Hello, carl.” Carl flinched and almost lost his footing on the sidewalk when the voice scared him out of his thoughts, but a hand stuck out and grabbed him before he fell. In the second it took him to look up, he was afraid he would see the face of Anderson, grinning with that stretched mouth and empty eyes. But it was just one of the Yang brothers. A local cult that had been around for years. They haven't caused any trouble after the bunker raid a few years back. Now they just walked around in their white robes, screaming about the end times. This one in particular Carl had seen several times. “Having trouble in the office, eh? You almost fell. Your face tells a story, you know. Trouble is ahead. Yang knows this and we can fight it. Nevermind the raid, carl. Join us! The brothers are eager to have a new recruit.” Carl threw the hand out to the brother’s side. “Leave me alone. Though I told you last time to never speak to me again."" Carl said this with the intent of making the man angry, perhaps so he would slip up and give Carl the chance to arrest him. But the brother’s face looked thoughtful, and he followed Carl as he walked up the hill once more. “Come on, Carl. you know we're right. I see it in your face. You look like you just had a visit with the devil.” Carl whirled around. A visit with the devil. That was exactly what he had had, one way or another. He grabbed the Yang brother by his hood and held him. “Shut the fuck up. Just shut up. I've dealt with enough shit today for the rest of my life and you're making it worse. Why don't you go find Yin and shove him up your ass?” he shoved the brother away, and when he turned around, his face was no longer thoughtful. It was malevolent and foreboding. “You have no idea what's coming, just like how you have no idea what is already here. You wonder where the calm was. But was it ever there? Or were you choosing to ignore the storm floating all around you? Hell is cold, you know. We speak to the devil. You think you know the truth of your existence. But you don't, and you never will. Or, perhaps, you will. It is not my say. That saying belongs to Him. and you would be advised to stay on His side. Meeting the devil is only the introduction to hell, you know. At its core, hell is dark. A dark void with nothing and nobody. When you end there you will feel nothing. You will be nothing. Because the dark wills it so. Watch your lights. Or, rather, watch the places your light does not touch. You may find something there you will never find again.” The brother pulled his hood back over his head and his face sunk into darkness. He walked away. Carl stood for a long time. He didn't move. He simply thought. And in his thoughts, he came away with one stupid thought. One human thought, something a little boy would find in that long speech from the brother. I should sleep with my lights on tonight. He walked the rest of the way home in silence, with no thoughts in his head other than Yang and Him. Who was Him? God? Or the other one? Carl believed Yang spoke of the latter. But he laughed off the implication that this was anything but a simple criminal who needs to be caught, because, after all, he was a cop. He caught bad guys. So he should catch a bad guy. Tomorrow, he thought, trying to put his troubles behind him, tomorrow I'll worry.

Later

Carl hit the raw chicken with the meat hammer. Up and down, up and down, tenderizing it. He set the hammer down and picked up the cutting board with the chicken on it, carrying the brown piece of wood over to the crock pot and slid the chicken into the black pot and hit the on button. The smell of soup filled the room and he went and sat at the dinner table. Alone. There were two other chairs at the table, and only one of them had been used the past three years. His wife had left him for another man three years ago, and officially divorced him two years ago. His son Sam had died four years ago, and that was the source of the trouble. He had drowned on his way home from school, probably walking along the sidewalk, not a care in his eleven year old head, when something happened. A simple trip, or maybe, just maybe, a push had ended up with him falling off the sidewalk and slamming his head on the concrete before sliding into a ditch filled with water. He had been found facedown, his Minecraft backpack filled with water. His wife blamed him. He was supposed to take him home that day, but he told him in the morning it wasn't too slick to walk home, and wasn't too wet. He assured him he would be fine. Carl was aware he was crying at the table, alone. And that thought only made him cry more. He supposed he was lucky. He never turned to cigarettes or alcohol. Rather he drowned himself, much like his son, in his work. He helped run thirteen different major busts that year. Seven more than average. His wife said he was a machine, more devoted to his work than her. He supposed she was right in the end. His sorrow was not for her, who he had always harbored neutral feelings for, but for Sam. He had loved Sam with all his heart. He had never loved anyone as much as him and most likely never would again.Lost in sorrow he cried, for how long he did not know. He was finally broken from his prison of memory by the long beep that signaled the crockpot was ready. He opened his eyes, red and blurry from tears, and went over to it. He grabbed the lid and carefully lifted it off. He set it on the marble counter, and shredded the chicken before placing the lid back on and starting it again. Then he realized. He lived in a small neighborhood on the outskirts of the main city, but he always heard the drone of the highway and passing cars, always heard the birds chirping, always heard people walking their dog. But he heard nothing. He went to his window and opened it. It was dark. He wasn’t hungry anymore. It was just four. I swear to god it was just four… he looked at his microwave clock. It was three in the morning. What the hell was happening? Suddenly he heard the long and somewhat dramatic creak of a door opening in the hallway. The lightbulb above his head glowed fiercely until it was brighter than the sun, and Carl shielded his eyes from its all encompassing glow. Then it shattered, and every light in the house shattered with it. He heard the crockpot explode too and his back was covered with a fiercely hot liquid and Carl screamed and pawed at his back before running into the hall shower and turning on the water, not caring that he was still clothed. But it didn't stop. He continued to burn. The shower door slammed shut and the water began to fill the tub. Carl continued to scream until he was hoarse. He turned off the water but it didn't work, the shower head kept pouring and pouring, until his ankles were covered. Then his knees, then his legs, then his chest… as the water approached his head he heard laughter. The water stopped. The burning stopped. He heard meaty trumps coming from the hallway and he suddenly overcome with fear so thick he felt as if the parts of him not underwater had become submerged too. A primal fear. The thumps continued until they stopped right outside the cherry wooden door and he heard a fierce snap as whatever was outside his door punched a hole through it. It reached in, only a silhouette in the darkness which continued to accompany Carl, and ripped the doorknob off. The door slowly swung open. The room became filled with pure malevolence, pure hatred, pure cynicism. Then a laugh. It was a horrible laugh, like the thing's throat was submerged. Like it was drowning. Carl became sure of something then. It was Him. The thing the Yang brother referred to. And then it was there. It stood against the darkness, somehow glowing without producing any light. Carl saw Him with shocking clarity. He was tall, taller than carl. He looked down at him. He was naked, skinless, his muscles flexing as if they were separate entities. He was relatively fit, and he reminded him of the anatomy dolls they had in high school. But his face was what differed. Instead of eyes there were two huge pits, each blacker than black but each with a piercing purple light where the pupil should be, like a laser pointer. At first Carl thought He had no teeth, but he did. They were black. He dripped blood, no, poured it, as if he truly had just been skinned. The purple lights locked on carl. “Having a good time, Carl? I know I am. And don't try to talk, you won't be able to.” Carl tried anyway but nothing came. “I won't stay long. Don't worry. I just have a message for you.” the thing comically cleared its throat. When it spoke, it spoke with sharp hatred. “You are nothing, Carl. Nothing. You are a small, fat, little nothing. You try so hard to be something but you can't. I will make you suffer. I will make others suffer. But that is not my purpose here. You spoke earlier of the calm. So did Yang. but you both got it wrong. The calm has been your whole life. So ask yourself, Carl, if your forty years of existence have been calm, what is the storm?” He smiled wider. “You'll find out soon, my friend. Oh, and Sam says hi. He told me to make you understand him a little better.” The water turned on again and didn't stop. It went over his head. As Carl screamed for air and banged the glass and spasmed and choked, he saw Him through the glass. He never stopped smiling.

Interlude: Limbo Carl was in a field. It was a great field, green and sunny in that way only matched by the vibrance of neon, the sky clear and sunny. It felt as if he was standing in some great memory, some lost child's memory of summer. The field stretched endlessly in every direction, and he heard the chirp of birds despite the fact no birds were there. He turned in every direction, the light stinging his eyes, and he shielded them with his hands for a second before putting them down. “Hello?” he called out. “Is anyone here?” as he was about to call again he felt a charge run through his body, not one of electricity but of light, and he suddenly felt safe. Like nothing could touch him. He heard the angelic sound of trumpets and saw the sky split open and an angel descend from the glowing rift exactly like something out of a cartoon. The angel was beautiful, a woman with fine blond hair white wings and a white robe. Her face looked too perfect to truly exist, as if she was not real but a stone statue shaped by the hands of michelangelo. Her skin was glowing with holy light and her wonderful hair flowed down to her shoulders, her eyes were a perfect sea green and they focused on Carl with a warm light. She touched down and smiled at Carl. he suddenly felt as if he was an intruder, like his imperfect human form was not worthy of meeting this radiating figure. He became embarrassed, but when she spoke, he instantly felt as if she was speaking to an old friend. “Hello, carl. My name is Yin. I appear to you in this form because it is one humans commonly associate with safety.” she brushed a strand of blond hair from her angelic face before continuing. “You must have oh so many questions. Come, sit, let us talk.” a round marble table materialized in front of him and he was aware a bench had appeared behind him and Yin. he sat on the marble bench, bracing for the cold. It was warm and comfortable, as if it was feathers instead of stone. Carl felt in awe of Yin, felt amazed and confused and not a little excited. He remembered he had read The Hobbit as a teen and chuckled inwardly as he thought that he and Bilbo might not be in different circumstances. He cleared his throat. “I do, your holiness. Could I ask why I was chosen to be here?” Yin laughed and Carl thought it to be the polar opposite of His laugh, His laugh was cruel and wet and full of hatred. Simply thinking of it was enough to make Carl want to scream. Yin’s laugh was one of kindness, of safety and care, unmatched in happiness. She spread her hands outward as she spoke. “You are in Limbo, Carl. limbo is a place in between my kingdom…” she stopped for a second and her smile faltered. “And His kingdom. Right now this is a place of good. I chose this because I believe it is the perfect place to have a conversation with a friend. But back to your question. You may be expecting some grand answer, but truthfully, you were not chosen by me or Him. you were chosen by something else.” Carl thought about this with his hands on the table. He didn't much care now how he was chosen, but what was to come. “What is going on?” he asked. Yin placed her hands calmly together on the table in front of her, and her mesmerizing green eyes stared into Carl with apprehension. “A storm is coming, much like that man told you. The hooded one. I can't tell you what will happen or why, you must find that out yourself if you are to succeed. But what I can tell you is that a war has begun. And you will be my only soldier.""She looked on the verge of tears and Carl felt immensely afraid. A god was crying in front of him, and that did not mean well. “I feel immensely guilty for having to put you in such a position, but you must understand it was not my choice. It was my father’s. Eventually you will learn of my father and the other one. Him. but you will learn in time. I will be with you on your journey.” Carl sat, dismayed. Why him? Does he not have enough on his hands with the killer running loose and his sadness? Now he must be thrust into some war of the gods? It all felt unfair. But he did not say that. Instead, he said something else. “I'll do it. But when it’s over, what do I get?” Yin shook her head and smiled sadly. “Nothing, or maybe something. It isn't for me to know. But you must trust, Carl. trust i will guide you.” Carl stood up and held out his hand. Yin stood up and held her hand out. When Carl went to shake she retracted it with a playful smile. “I have faith that you will accomplish your goals as well as mine, Carl. I believe this partnership is a lasting one. And I will show you some of my power as proof of my status.” she held out her other hand and a bolt of electricity host from it and into Carl’s stomach. He felt something change. At the same time Yin offered her hand again and Carl took it. Yin's eyes went white and she began to ascend and speak in a voice not her own. “Clear!”",0,1745963980.0,writers,1,0.5,False

Have tried a flush, but my plastic stopper had a hole in it (Breville) so I’ll try a solid one tomorrow when it arrives incase the backwashing improves it.

I’m a 43-year-old man in London going through a challenging time in my life.

I’m not looking to date — I just really need *gentle human connection* right now.

Ideally, I’d love to meet a kind woman from anywhere but ideally around my age for an hour or so to share something simple:

* a walk (difficult virtually but not beyond the realms of possibility)
* a quiet chat about anything and everything
* and maybe a tea or coffee

Just human warmth, no expectations.

I’m sensitive and a bit worn down at the moment — but I’d show up fully, respectfully, and appreciatively.

If you’re nearby and open to meeting in person, that would be ideal. But if not — I’m also very open to connecting online for a chat or call. Sometimes, just knowing someone’s out there makes a big difference.

If you’re someone who understands what it’s like to need presence more than conversation, I’d be truly grateful to hear from you.

Thank you for reading.

I have always been chronically into masterbation even as a younger child.  I think it has caused lower T for my whole life basically.  Most recently I was in the low 300's and was super depressed.  I love my wife a lot but she has no motivation to have sex and it is killing me.  It made me think maybe I'm the problem.  I ended up googling ""over masterbation and low T"" and it brought me to SR and I dove into it.  I figured I had nothing to lose and I love a challenge.  

I am now on day 8 and have felt a lot different.  I feel like I have power again in my own life.  Today was the most intriguing day thus far as well.  While I was at work there was a pretty nurse practitioner who came into the lunch room.  She saw that the product I sell isn't in the disease state she works in and proceded to get some coffee.  When she came closer I just introduced myself and she kind of just stared at me.  She then started asking a lot of questions and just lingered in the lunch room for about 15 minutes.  She definitely liked entering my ""space"".  I honestly felt like she respected my presence and she said she was disappointed when I left to go talk to the doctors I was there to see for work.  Later when I got home I noticed my wife was ""clingy"" to some degree.  This really was odd as she ""dislikes"" physical touch.  I'm not sure where this journey will take me but if it helps fix my testosterone and help things with my wife I will consider it a huge success.

Thaddeus glistens faintly in the lobby sunlight, muscles flexing with every turn of the wrench. He’s also somehow managed to spill an entire pot of coffee down his chest without noticing.

Angel freezes on the last step, jaw dropping.

“...Oh *no,*” he whispers, one hand clutching the stair railing like it’s the only thing keeping him upright. “Who the *hell* left a full-stack angel beefcake in the fucking lobby?”

Thaddeus looks up and beams. “Good morning! I fixed the caffeine box. It was sad inside. I made it... ah... un-sad?""

Angel, now fanning himself with a breakfast menu: “I know he’s a damn *angel*, but GOOD LORD THAT MAN COULD BENCH PRESS MY ENTIRE TRAUMA.”

He spends the rest of the morning nervously sipping burnt coffee while watching Thaddeus try to reattach a ceiling fan using a glowstick, muttering to himself, *“Nope. Not safe. Not good. Dangerously handsome. This is how gay people die.”*",1,1745963302.0,hazbin,0,1.0,False
1kazzax,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kazzax/dont_know_what_to_do_about_meds/,Don't know what to do about meds,I've only been on three meds for mental health and two of them were in the past 6 months but looking for something with less side effects. I was diagnosed with MDD last year and teleheath psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin. Liked it for a month but then anxiety crept in hard. I white knuckled for a bit and was using weed to get me to sleep but that just counteracted and made the anxiety unbearable. Had a nervous breakdown and drove myself to the hospital a couple months ago. Got off Wellbutrin while inpatient and they put me on Risperidone (very low dose but albeit for depression). Finishing up an IOP now and the APRN is surprised I was prescribed antipsychotics for depression but continued me on it since they seemed to be working. Well I'm 2 months in on it and I'm soooooooo exhausted. Like can't get my body to move in the morning and I have lil kids so even after 8-9hrs of sleep and ungodly amounts of coffee I'm still dragging a$$ in the afternoon as well. I tapered myself down to just 0.25mg once at night and I can barely make it 30min before passing out. I'm scheduled to return to work in 2 weeks and getting nervous. Aside from extreme fatigue and mild weight gain I'm feeling very stable on Risperidone but I'm sure I can find something that helps with being a total sedative. I've read way too many threads on other depression meds and feel more lost. I wanna check with APRN if I can take an every other day dose since I'm already on the lowest. Or maybe take half of 0.25mg. I did notice slight anxious feeling when I first lowered dose and I'm worried if I switch to an SSRI it will take too long to stabilize. I can't be adjusting meds while returning to work. I was prone to manic states and working till 3am daily and not sleeping but I think some of that was weed addiction... Never got bi polar or borderline diagnosis but a lot of what those folks say in my group resonate with me. I'm 70+ days clean from weed and have no plans of returning...quit drinking years ago. Anyways not sure if I should play Russian roulette but I know I hated SSRIs when I was diagnosed chronic fatigue (very likely depression) as a late teen. I hate all these side effects so exhaustion is probably the lesser of bigger evils. Any suggestions?,1,1745963296.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

But now I’ve realised that my roots are obviously growing back in, and it doesn’t look as good as I’d hoped for, so I’m just wondering if there are any hair colours that I could get done that is low maintenance and blends well with my roots? 
I would love to get some subtle highlights done too but not sure how “low maintenance” and worth it is. 

Also not sure if this matters either but I am neutral undertones, with a slight preference to cool tone but I think warm tone suits me better, and my seasonal palette soft autumn/ summer! And I would prefer having a more “natural” look so unfortunately not vibrant colours this time round.

Today, she had a dental checkup in the morning and her father suggested going out for lunch. While there, she exhibited clear signs of being ""done"". She was getting upset with small things and staying upset. 

He suggested going out for a coffee he wanted. I told him that she was all done with being out rn and that she wouldn't handle going somewhere else very well. We repeated this a couple of times.

He insisted on going, said he would get his coffee to go and suggested getting a cookie for her, also adding he would ""deal with her"". 

We went, he got her a cookie and he had a different  coffee than the one he had wanted to go there for (he wanted their Columbian, but they just had an El Salvador coffee). He initially had it to go and wanted to drink it outside on their patio. She started getting restless again. He decided to change his order to a pour over which was a to stay. She was getting upset she could not have a ""special drink"" and staying upset (turning in her chair with face pressed against it and not responding). 

He was becoming frustrated since he ""just ordered this"". I told him i'd take her for a walk while he finished. I took her in front if the business, on grass, and played I Spy. 

After he finished, he grabbed her hand and started walking really fast, to where she was running to keep up with him. He told her he was upset and when she asked why, he said ""because i took you out to lunch, which was nice and you got upset at the end. Then i took you here and got you a cookie and you got upset too"". 

She said ""sorry, dad. Sorry""

I said ""hey. You knew she was done at lunch. I told you she wasnt able to manage the coffee place. She did her best and did a lot better than i thought she would"".

He says I am undermining him. I say he set her up for failure and was disciplining her for something beyond her control. 

Also to note, last night was her first good night of sleep in a few nights. She had her grandparents over for a few days before this and we are moving soon.

I am not anti-discipline.

Thaddeus glistens faintly in the lobby sunlight, muscles flexing with every turn of the wrench. He’s also somehow managed to spill an entire pot of coffee down his chest without noticing.

Angel freezes on the last step, jaw dropping.

“...Oh *no,*” he whispers, one hand clutching the stair railing like it’s the only thing keeping him upright. “Who the *hell* left a full-stack angel beefcake in the fucking lobby?”

Thaddeus looks up and beams. “Good morning! I fixed the caffeine box. It was sad inside. I made it... ah... un-sad?""

Angel, now fanning himself with a breakfast menu: “I know he’s a damn *angel*, but GOOD LORD THAT MAN COULD BENCH PRESS MY ENTIRE TRAUMA.”

He spends the rest of the morning nervously sipping burnt coffee while watching Thaddeus try to reattach a ceiling fan using a glowstick, muttering to himself, *“Nope. Not safe. Not good. Dangerously handsome. This is how gay people die.”*",1,1745963236.0,HazbinHotel,5,1.0,False

Yesterday, 28 April, for most of the day and part of the night, the electricity went out across all of Portugal and Spain.
I had no idea this would end up being one of the most profund days of my life.

After this happened at around 11:30 am I went outside with my cousin and a friend, and the world felt alive. Everyone was out. No one was on their phones, people were actually talking to each other, smiling, and open to chatting with strangers. That invisible wall between people was just gone. I felt like I could talk with anyone with ease, people were actually looking at me ready to talk.
There were lines of people at the few stores that were still open and it felt weird seeing so many people not looking down at their phones, they were just talking with each other and fully aware of everything around.

I don’t remember the last time I saw so many happy faces in the streets. Coffees were packed, dads were playing football with their kids, people were talking from balcony to balcony etc etc and I was amazed by all of it.

It honestly felt like that afternoon lasted forever. Time definitely moved slower, and that little voice in my head telling me to check my phone was finally silent. I felt peaceful.

My friend felt the same. And now we are both sad, knowing this might be the only time we’ll ever experience what life was like before phones and constant connection like the early 2000's.
I wish I could be my age now living in a time before technology took over our lives.

But here I am, making coffee at 3 pm, thinking about how this game is amazing. Last night, I told my friend that he has to play it, which led me to think about how they would experience the beginning of the story for the first time, which led me to think about Gustave and his character arc, and I remembered the funeral scene. So the machine is pouring that espresso into little measuring cups, and my eyes start to tear up as I get overwhelmed by the fact that this game is making me feel something in the moment.

I haven't experienced anything like this game since Death Stranding's ending and some moments in between on the journey.

Now I decided to listen to the sound track and damn, just by itself, listening on my cheap audiophile setup, I can't stop but being emotional about what I'm hearing.

I want to go back to play it. This game is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. As a game dev myself, what an inspiration! What an achievement of talent, direction. I can't even fathom what it took from a narrative designer's POV to make this game happen, and also, of course, everyone in the production trenches. This game, on a game design level, is also phenomenal. It's rough on the edges, but what a game of an actual GAME, not ""game mechanics bundled with a narrative to tag you along"". But a whole, unique experience, that is honestly hard to put into words.

I don't know how else to sell it to people I know as ""you just have to play this."" Anything I say is a spoiler. It's incredible, and you have to experience it yourself and define why for yourself, because no amount of description will sell you on it.

I believe that marketing is not about how you describe something on a Steam page or how much gameplay you show in the first 5 seconds of a trailer. It's about communicating your beliefs and values through words, sound, music, and visuals. And they communicated so much on that first reveal trailer that I was hooked right away. And it sucks that some people just gonna pass by and won't experience this because it's just not aligned with what they are.

But hell, I'm so fucking glad there are so many people that are into this game, and are into weird fantasies with deep themes of death, meaning of life, love, sacrifice and doing something small for the others. As someone who's writing a world and a story, and hopefully eventually will get to make my own rendition / meditations on such topics that I think on a daily basis, this game is extremely inspiring.

I wish you so much success, devs. Thank you.",1,1745963210.0,expedition33,0,1.0,False

We have great chemistry, attraction, etc. but bad timing. He was in a relationship, but our connection grew unpredictably over the years. There was a period of months we were texting all day, every day, meeting for coffee and hikes, etc.

His boyfriend cheated and they broke up 5 months ago. He confided in me easily up until that point, then abruptly withdrew. Over recent months, his communication gradually decreased. He would answer all my questions, but grew less patient over time. Eventually told me he likes me, but wanted to be alone for the time being (ie a break from dating), and didn’t want to lead me on in the meantime.

Since then, he hardly contacts me. He does respond when I reach out. We’ve met for coffee a few times. I see him at the gym and our interactions are brief but friendly. He started working out with a new guy and preemptively explained the other guy had a partner who he was also close to (showed me pictures without me asking). As if he perceived what it looked like to me and wanted to set the record straight? And he said recently “you can text me whenever to get coffee” which I did a few days later and he agreed to it.

So is he avoidant (as he’s recently out of a long term relationship) or has he just lost interest in me? I’m living my life apart from him, regardless, but it would be nice to understand.",1,1745963205.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm kinda complex medically, so im gonna keep his post brief/just facts related:

🔴 Medical stuff:

- I'm 27 years old.

- Just passed 3 years on T, levels are on the low side/normal (I'm nonbinary and prefer them lower).

- Top surgery 3 years ago.

- 5'2, 174.2lbs as of this morning. Goal weight: 155 

- Highest weight around 205lbs (5 years ago), lowest 147 (3 years ago). I was 192 in December 2024.

- I have a history of gaining and losing 60lbs twice over 8 years (purposefully losing each time). I have never purposely attempted serious weight loss while on T.

- I'm on depression meds, fin & min for my hair, and medication for chronic pain due to arthrits (started around a year ago).

As an aside, I've tried about every depression med under the sun, anxiety meds, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics. The one I'm on keeps me pretty stable so im happy with it. 

🔴 Current efforts for weight loss:

- I walk an average of 4k steps a day over 1 week due to one of my physically demanding jobs (I'm all over a retail store, working online order pick up, and my other job running groups for small children). I can walk up to 15k steps a day at my retail job.

- I eat a protien pancake with low cal syrup for breakfast, small protein shake for lunch + pumpkin seeds/an apple with peanut butter, then a meal prepped meal with a protein, carb, and 2 servings of veggies.

- 2x coffees a day with low cal creamer.

- I will OCCASIONALLY snack because I get mega hungry throughout the day, usually will have a protien yogurt shake at work. 

- I started seriously trying to lose weight around Feb 20th of 2025, so far only lost 9lbs.

--------

I'm already tired as shit from my physically demanding job, graduating grad school, and working non-regular shifts (nights, weekends, random shit as its assigned to me.) I'd really prefer NOT to eat more as the more I eat, the less I lose. For example, last week I switched things up and had a meal of beans, rice, chorizo, fruit, and veggies for dinner, and actually GAINED a pound, lol. This week I'm pure veggies and rice (stir fry).

For now, I'm a broke post-grad student looking for my first major job with my masters degree. There's no telling when I'll actually be paid my worth, so money is kinda tight. Please keep that in mind.

I am seen by SO many medical professionals (therapists, doctors, rheumatologists, physical therapists, surgeons, endos), and my blood levels are normal. They're actually praising my weightloss. I just want it to go faster -- look awful in the mirror and my muscles are so tight from my arthritis. I want to feel better, faster.",2,1745963038.0,FTMFitness,6,1.0,False

New to the sub - just looking for some swift corrective guidance. I have bought an ESP grinder and a Bambino Plus. I am grinding approx. 18.5grams of beans to create a nice double shot Americano or Flat White.

The issue I am finding is that whilst it takes 8 seconds or so for flow to start, it seems to end very prematurely (20 seconds or so). There isn't a lot of liquid (although admittedly I am not using proper coffee cups to guage this accurately, and the scales I bought don't fit well to measure extracted weight). 

Is this just because the preprogrammed double shot button is \~28 seconds or so, and is part of the ""dialling in"" process?

Unclear whether ""time"" is a variable set upfront or a consequence of grind size, density etc. Possibly a silly question!",1,1745962810.0,u_DazzzASTER,0,1.0,False

Before this, she’d talk about how I brighten her day, be so pleasant to be around and how she’d be crushing over me any time I’d come up in conversation, I never had any doubt that she felt the same way but I obviously did something to make her realise she wasn’t ready.

I’ve been no contact for last month or so. I’m planning to wait until we inevitably bump into each other at Book club but I equally want to be sure I’m giving her the room she needs.

1kazkr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1kazkr7/dreamscapes_and_broken_music_wandering_through/,Dreamscapes and Broken Music: Wandering Through Charles de Lint’s Newford,"As I entered Newford, someone was playing music under a bridge while talking to ghosts. Or maybe they were painting doorways that led into other worlds. Or maybe it was just Jilly Coppercorn telling stories with her hands, trying to heal the world one dream at a time. That’s how it is with Charles de Lint’s Newford series: you never walk in through the front door. You stumble in sideways, like you’ve taken a wrong turn on a rainy night and ended up somewhere just a little too strange to be safe—and a little too beautiful to leave.

Newford isn’t a city on any map. It’s a fictional North American sprawl of music venues, artist lofts, soup kitchens, shelters, junk shops, and liminal spaces where myth bleeds into concrete. It’s not one kind of place—it’s every city that’s ever felt like it was hiding something just beneath the surface. Since Dreams Underfoot (1993), Charles de Lint has been sketching its skyline in story after story, turning what started as a loosely linked set of urban fantasies into a deep, resonant mythos. This isn’t fantasy about kingdoms and battles. This is about surviving in the aftermath. About waking up haunted, picking up your guitar, and still choosing kindness.

De Lint began his career in high fantasy—The Riddle of the Wren, Moonheart, The Harp of the Grey Rose—but with Newford, he brought the magic home. Instead of distant forests and named swords, he gave us folk singers with fey blood, street kids with second sight, and painters whose canvases could open doors to other realms. The mythology here isn’t borrowed from a single source. It’s a bricolage: Celtic tricksters, Indigenous spirit animals, dreamtime constructs, and invented folklore, all braided together into something wholly his own.

Take Memory & Dream (1994), one of de Lint’s most layered and powerful works. It follows Isabelle Copley, an artist whose talent conjures the fantastic into physical being. She paints the numena—strange beings from other realms—and pays the price when one of them lingers too long. This is a book about abuse, about artistic integrity, about memory, about the half-light spaces where dream and trauma overlap. It’s quintessential Newford: fiercely compassionate, quietly magical, and emotionally devastating.

Or Someplace to Be Flying (1998), a sprawling urban myth that dives into the animal people—beings who’ve lived alongside humanity in secret. Coyote, Raven, and Crow walk the streets, sometimes taking human form, sometimes not, playing long games of fate and renewal. Here, we meet the Crow Girls: Maida and Zia. Wild, chaotic, joyful, mischievous, they are tricksters without malice, ancient spirits wearing teenage goth girl bodies. They dance through these books like a windstorm in a vintage clothing shop—giggling, hungry, full of unpredictable kindness and barely suppressed power. They aren’t just comic relief. They’re chaos as compassion. Innocence without ignorance. They’re unforgettable.

The Crow Girls return in The Onion Girl (2001), where the series takes its most raw and personal turn. Jilly Coppercorn, beloved painter and perennial center of the Newford circle, is hit by a car and left paralyzed. As her body heals slowly in the waking world, her mind wanders into dreamlands—interior worlds formed from suppressed trauma, wonder, and long-forgotten pain. What surfaces is a history of childhood abuse, a lost sister, and the ragged path toward healing. It’s not an easy book, and de Lint doesn’t pretend otherwise. He doesn’t sensationalize trauma—he traces its scars with care, showing that survival is not the end of the story, only a beginning.

Widdershins (2006) picks up that story and pushes it forward. Jilly is stronger now, but still shaken. The book widens its scope, exploring the fraught tensions between the North American animal spirits and the invading Celtic ones—an echo of real colonial history played out in the spirit world. It’s one of de Lint’s most political books, grappling with appropriation, reconciliation, and the possibility of cultural healing. And through it all, the Crow Girls are there, weaving between the serious and the surreal, eating too much sugar and saving the day in ways no one expects.

Then there’s Trader (1997), which at first glance feels like a departure—no Jilly, no Crow Girls, no familiar cast—but underneath, it’s all Newford. Max Trader is a luthier, a quiet man who builds guitars and lives a careful, contained life until one morning he wakes up in someone else’s body. He’s been body-switched by a man who wants a better life. What unfolds is part Kafka, part urban fable: a story about identity, loss, and how much of us is tied to our physical selves. It’s also one of de Lint’s most emotionally subtle works, and one of his most deeply compassionate. Max’s struggle to rebuild, to reclaim not just his body but his sense of self, mirrors the journeys of so many Newford characters. Because really, all of them are trying to come home to themselves.

If The Onion Girl and Widdershins are the emotional and spiritual core of the series, then the short story collections are its heartbeat. Dreams Underfoot lays the groundwork, introducing us to Geordie Riddell (musician), Christy (journalist, maybe a bit too close to the author), Jilly, Wendy, and others. Each story is a window into the wider city, often featuring characters on the margins—runaways, addicts, artists, the haunted and the healing. The Ivory and the Horn (1995) continues this, darker and grittier, showcasing the city’s underside without losing its glimmer of hope. In Tapping the Dream Tree (2002), the magic gets weirder. Stranger beings slip in. Time and space get bendy. But the warmth, the empathy, the commitment to wonder remains constant.

Then there’s The Blue Girl (2004), a story that stands perfectly alone but fits cleanly into the Newford tapestry. Imogene, a high school misfit with dyed hair and a dead friend, stumbles into a war between dream spirits. It’s a story about being young and othered, about loneliness and defiance and the strange safety of being seen by something else. The Painted Boy (2010) goes even farther, stepping outside of Newford proper and following a Mexican-American teen in Arizona discovering a hidden dragon lineage. It’s one of de Lint’s most overtly magical and diverse stories, and it extends the Newford sensibility—empathy, myth, art, redemption—into a new geography.

One of the things that defines Newford is that the magic always costs something. These aren’t stories where the hero wins a sword and everything is fixed. Instead, they ask: how do you keep creating when you’re in pain? How do you forgive yourself for what happened to you? How do you let others help you carry the burden? De Lint’s characters grow, break, rebuild. They relapse. They relapse again. They fall in love, mess it up, try again. They find grace in the small things: a song played under a streetlight, a stranger’s unexpected kindness, a memory shared over coffee.

And always, there’s the city. Newford feels like it remembers you, even if you’ve never been there. It’s a place where the border between the numinous and the everyday is tissue-thin, but no one walks through it alone. The books form a kind of emotional atlas—each story another pin on the map, another ghost in the stairwell, another song drifting up from the subway.

Charles de Lint may not be writing Newford as often now. He’s turned more toward music, to quieter novellas, to living his own life. But the city remains. Not just in print, but in spirit. It’s out there—in a mural you walk past too quickly, in the busker who looks like he might have wings under his coat, in the girl sitting on the bench who talks to birds like they answer back.

Want to hear a story? There’s this city, see. Not on any map. But if you close your eyes, you might get there. Just follow the music. And if you see two girls in black tutus feeding crows french fries and laughing at the sky—tell them Jilly sent you.",1,1745962267.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

Has any one switched from Semaglutide to Tirzepatide and had better results?,"I've been on semaglutide for six months now and have only managed to lose 10 pounds. It's a bit disheartening, and I'm considering making the switch to tirzepatide, but the cost is really daunting. I can’t help but worry that starting fresh at a lower dose might hinder any progress I’ve made, even if it’s minimal.

Let me give you a bit of backstory. Weight has always been a struggle for me. Despite being active and mindful about what I eat, I’ve battled weight issues my entire life. Back in 2003, I took the leap and had gastric bypass surgery, hoping to finally turn things around. However, I suspect my body adapted to those changes because, over the years, I regained much of the weight I had lost, all while still eating less than what a typical person would.

Last year, I decided to hire a personal trainer, and while I did see a modest weight loss of 6 pounds, the process felt frustrating. It often seemed like I was being forced to consume copious amounts of protein, with the excuse that my body was “starving.” 

When I finally started with semaglutide, the journey got off to a rocky start—I actually gained 6 pounds in the first week! After a few adjustments to my dose, I thought I’d try something different. I began incorporating green juice cleanses twice a week, hoping to shrink my stomach and curb my hunger. To my surprise, that’s when I finally started to see some results. After six months of relentless effort at the gym and tightly managing my diet, I’ve only lost 10 pounds, and it’s been quite the exhausting journey.

Here’s a peek into my typical eating habits:

Breakfast: coffee, organic unsweetened almond milk, and collagen.

Snack: gluten-free, low-carb beef or turkey stick.

*Lunch: Either a salad with no dressing and protein OR low-carb vegan protein powder mixed with water, about 1/4 cup of berries, 1/2 cup of spinach, chia, or flax seeds.

*Pre-workout: coconut water mixed with beetroot.

*Dinner: protein (chicken, steak, or fish) and veggies or salad with about 1/4 fruit. Only use avocado oil for cooking. Rarely do I have carbs; if I do, it's maybe a few potatoes or some rice (like enough for a toddler).

I focus on eating mostly organic and unprocessed foods that are low on the inflammatory scale, especially since I deal with gluten intolerance and chronic pain. I also make sure to take multiple vitamin supplements and regularly check my lab results.

Despite my best efforts, though, I often find my energy levels at rock bottom—feels like I have zero at times. 

Every day, I strive to hit at least 10,000 steps and I incorporate light weight training into my routine twice a week.

What’s frustrating is how my doctor seems to overlook the hard work I put into managing my blood sugar, especially since I'm pre-diabetic and sugars have always made me feel ill. While my cholesterol levels are currently good, I know they could be even better.

I need something that works. I feel like my body hates me.

It was poor in high school but sort of got better during college. I actually thought I was making good progress and could see a future where I was more at ease: for example, I took self dates at restaurants, sometimes could easily answer the phone or make appointments, didn’t constantly need to prep conversations before things, etc etc. I definitely still had some hard times but considerably better. 

However, I feel like in the past several years after college, I’ve not only regressed but got worse. I haven’t been to the dentist in years because I fear making the appointment and especially being yelled at for my gum health (I have always had weak gums that bleed no matter my brushing and flossing). I recently sold my car so I will take the bus or ride a bike, while the bike is easy, I spend nearly all day prepping myself for where to go for the bus, make sure the app is correct, timing correctly, where I’ll sit, etc. I purposefully miss calls and either text or email back, specifically work calls. Things I’ve done before, I’ll spend hours working up the courage to do even when I’ve enjoyed it before (coffee shop for example). I go completely mind blank whenever confrontation happens and it gets worse because I am silent and not responding. Most recent thing now is I ordered a suit online for an adult prom this Saturday and it needs to be tailored. The tailor is just far enough away that I’ll need the bus, so that’s #1 “issue” and the suit is definitely oversized a bit as it’s meant to be tailored to fit, specifically hemming the pants, and for some reason I feel like I’ll be ridiculed about it. This is also a tailor I’ve been to many years ago and had a very easy process. Last thing is now it’s too late to go today to make it on time and I’m nervous I’ll be too late for them to tailor it and I won’t have any suit for the prom and will disappoint my fiancé.

1kazcav,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1kazcav/sugar_is_a_deadly_poison_here_is_how_sugar_is/,Sugar is a deadly poison. Here is how sugar is killing you and what you can do about it with scientificly proven ways and research.,"Sugar might seem harmless, even joyful — baked into celebrations, stirred into coffee, hidden in nearly every snack. But behind its sweet taste, sugar is slowly chipping away at your health. It fuels inflammation in your body, causes spikes and crashes in your blood sugar, and over time, can lead to serious illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even Alzheimer’s. Studies now show that even people who aren’t overweight are at risk if their sugar intake is high. It’s not just about weight — it’s about what sugar is doing inside your body every day.

Think about this: a single can of soda contains around 10 teaspoons of sugar. That’s more than your body knows how to handle all at once. The effect is like pouring acid on your cells, causing wear and tear you can’t see until it’s too late. Over time, your liver can get overwhelmed, fat starts to build up where it shouldn’t, and your energy levels crash more often. Some experts compare sugar’s effect on the body to rust on metal — slow, steady destruction.

But here’s the good news: cutting back on sugar changes your life fast. Within days, people feel more energized, sleep better, and notice clearer skin. Over weeks, cravings shrink, mood improves, and brain fog lifts. It’s not about punishing yourself or giving up all sweetness — it’s about freeing your body from something that’s been dragging it down. Once you feel the difference, you won’t want to go back.

Most importantly, you’re not weak or broken if you find it hard to quit sugar. It was designed to be addictive — lighting up the same pleasure centers in the brain as some drugs. But you can take back control. Start small. Swap soda for sparkling water. Try fruit instead of candy. Use cinnamon or vanilla to bring natural sweetness to meals. Your body wants to heal — give it the chance. Let your future self thank you for the choices you make today.",8,1745961683.0,immortalists,0,0.9,False

We're starting The Great Gatsby next week, and you know how technology can be.
So, I set up at a table, plugged in my headphones, and hit play on the movie to test it out. Then like an absolute idiot, I didn't even think to close my laptop. I just got up and went to the restroom.
When I came back, I noticed a commotion near my table. The coffee shop staff looked flustered. As I approached my laptop, one of them quickly apologized, explaining that they had just had to ask someone to leave due to some inappropriate behavior with my computer.
I looked down at my screen, and my email inbox was open. This person had apparently decided to have a little fun by mass-deleting my emails.
The staff were apologetic but couldn't provide any details about the individual. The damage was done. I spent the rest of the afternoon panicked.
I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to recover from this. I feel like the biggest idiot in the world. I feel so incredibly irresponsible. I don't know if I can ever fix this.

I know it would probably disrupt sleep, but I'm curious if it could have some more effects, like causing vivid dreams or something like that?

I've also heard of the thing called ""caffeine nap"", in which you drink coffee right before nap. The logic is, instead of relying on alarm clock to wake you up, the caffeine will wake you up, when it starts working, and meanwhile, you can get some refreshing short sleep, like 20-30 minutes perhaps.

We never spoke just exchanged shy smiles while waiting for our orders. For months, it stayed that way. A glance, a smile, and nothing more.
One rainy morning, I forgot my umbrella and stood awkwardly by the door, trying to figure out how to get to my bus without getting soaked. She noticed, walked up, opened her umbrella over both of us, and simply said, “Let’s go.”
We walked together in silence, but somehow it didn’t feel awkward at all it felt right, almost comforting. When we reached the bus stop, she smiled and asked, “See you tomorrow?”
I smiled back, but for some reason, I never asked for her number. Maybe I was afraid that naming it would ruin whatever it was.
A few weeks later, she just stopped coming to the coffee shop. I never saw her again.
Even now, years later, I sometimes wonder:
Was that tiny, fleeting connection its own kind of love? Can love exist in those brief, wordless moments? Or does it need time, deeper knowing, and shared experiences to be real?

Promising features like a 20-bar pressure system, a milk frother, and precision temperature control made me curious about whether it delivers on its claims. Having used it daily for lattes, cappuccinos, and americanos, I’ve gathered plenty of insights to share about this espresso machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact footprint of this espresso machine makes it a perfect fit for smaller kitchens or cluttered counters. The brushed silver exterior adds a sophisticated touch, lending a professional vibe without feeling too heavy or industrial. While it’s lightweight at 9.48 pounds for portability, it still feels sturdy and well-made. The removable 39oz water tank is another thoughtful touch, making refilling and cleaning simple. Even when navigating its features for the first time, the dial operation felt intuitive, which is great for beginners like my younger sibling, who also tried using it.  

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
What struck me first was the 20-bar professional pump. Every shot I brewed had a rich aroma, and the perfect crema on top made it look as good as a barista-crafted espresso. The PID temperature control is a real gem, ensuring consistent results without overheating the coffee. This feature stood out when making back-to-back shots during Sunday family brunches. The integrated Americano mode deserves a special mention too—it combines an espresso machine with a classic coffee maker, saving me from owning two devices.  

**[Check Spacekey CM5080 Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dl5xxcc1/)**  

**Highlights**  
- Powerful 1350W rapid preheating system heats water in under 45 seconds.  
- Smart pre-soak mechanism enhances flavor extraction by evenly moistening coffee grounds.  
- Steam wand adjusts milk temperature and texture, making it easy to whip up cappuccinos and mochas.  
- Easy-to-follow options for making single or double shots (short or long press on the coffee button).  

**Milk Frothing System**  
The frother is hands-down one of my favorite features. My coworker, who’s a die-hard latte fan, tried it out and was impressed by the creamy, velvety foam it created. The 360° adjustable steam nozzle makes creating microfoam a breeze, whether you're an amateur like me or more experienced. Cleaning it is also easy, which eliminates the dread of post-coffee chores.  

**Downsides**  
Not every experience with the espresso machine was flawless.  
- Occasional inconsistency in brew temperature, making it difficult to achieve café-quality shots every single time.  
- Brewing longer shots results in over-extraction sometimes, leaving a slightly bitter taste.  
- Customer support wasn’t entirely helpful in troubleshooting these minor issues.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other semi-automatic espresso machines like the Breville Bambino Plus or the De'Longhi Dedica, this espresso maker maintains its competitive edge in affordability and features. However, while higher-priced models, like the Breville, excel in durability and extremely consistent temperature control, the Spacekey machine is more suitable for those looking to achieve good results without an excessive price tag. The removable tank and Americano mode here, for instance, add conveniences not always available in pricier counterparts.  

**Budget-Friendly**  
Talking value, the Spacekey CM5080 offers an attractive package of features for its price range. Sure, it’s not the Rolls Royce of espresso machines, but it doesn’t aim to be. Instead, it balances features and cost well, making it perfect for budget-conscious buyers or casual coffee drinkers who want better quality without breaking the bank.

Your dating app bio is your digital handshake, your first impression distilled into a few crucial sentences. It's your chance to grab attention, showcase your personality, and signal what you're looking for. In the crowded landscape of online dating, a compelling bio is the key to standing out from the sea of profiles. A bland or generic bio can easily get lost, while a thoughtful and engaging one can spark genuine interest and lead to meaningful connections. So, how do you craft a dating app bio that truly reflects you and attracts the right kind of matches? First, understand your audience. Are you looking for a long-term relationship, casual dating, or simply new friends? Tailor your bio to reflect your intentions. Being honest and upfront about what you want avoids misunderstandings later on. Don't be afraid to be specific. Instead of saying ""looking for fun,"" try ""looking for someone to explore local coffee shops and quirky bookstores with."" Show, don't tell. Instead of listing adjectives like ""kind,"" ""adventurous,"" or ""funny,"" demonstrate those qualities through anecdotes or specific examples. For instance, instead of saying ""I'm adventurous,"" you could write ""Just back from hiking the Inca Trail and already planning my next ...

Over the last few months I've been experiencing sudden shortness of breath followed by numbness in my mouth and the right side of my body. During these episodes I do not have any chest pain or normal reflux symptoms. I also wheeze at times. My stools are normal and not dark.

I got checked for heart attack and stroke but GPs suggest it is a panic attack - I do have mildly high cholesterol but they are convinced it is not the case.

On the other hand I have a history of acid reflux, and confirmed diagnosis of H pylori in he past. However the doctors which examined me for stroke are not fully aware of the extent of this and have shrugged it off. I am yet to see a stomach doctor.

As a result I have self prescribed PPIs and antiacid as per my previous diagnosis, quir coffee and reduced smoking - these have improved my state. This leads me to confirm that it is heavy GERD.

I am on my way to getting an OGD but I was wondering if any doctors have advice on this namely:

How serious can It be? Could it be cancer?

What can I do to further assist relief?

1kayxjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1kayxjy/life_of_a_failure/,Life of a failure,"I’m a 30-year-old male who, a year and a half ago, went through a series of depressing life events. I lost my software development job and had a falling-out with roommates I considered friends. With no income and nowhere to go, I had to move back in with my parents. At the time, I assumed I’d find another tech job within a few months, but the market has been tough. Despite studying for hundreds of hours, I was ghosted from hundreds of positions I applied for and failed the handful of interviews I’ve landed.

I don’t have any close friends—at least none I could rely on for shared housing. I suspect being on the spectrum has made it hard for me to maintain long-term friendships. A recurring pattern in my life is that I’ll initially get along well with one or two people, but when they introduce new friends into the group, those newcomers don’t like me. Eventually, they convince my original friends to distance themselves from me.

I’m quiet, try to be friendly, and don’t act obnoxiously, yet people often find things to complain about me anyways, that I don’t interact enough with them or that something about me puts them off. Because of that I no longer have any real people I can call friends and after seeing this pattern occur over and over throughout my life even after trying my hardest to fit in, I decided to stop trying to please people and just accept that fact that I can't make people like me.

Living with my parents has been unbearable. I have many childhood traumas that are coming back now that I moved back home. My mother is extremely controlling—she dictates what I eat, when I sleep (strict 10 PM bedtime), monitors my credit card spending, and micromanages nearly every aspect of my life. I can't buy something I want to eat or drink like coffee without her interrogating me as to why I'm spending money I should be saving. I don't have a father figure in my life. My dad lives at home with us but he's never interacted directly me or treated me like a person. Everything he wants to say to me, he tells my mom to say it to me even when I'm right there. To outsiders, he's completely spineless and lets people talk shit about him to his face without retaliation but ends up takes out his anger on me by criticizing me 24/7 to my mom, trying to convince her to put more restrictions on me. He also tries to fuck with me by doing stuff like restarting the router or putting cameras around the house to record what I'm doing. You might wonder why a 30-year-old tolerates this, but:

1. My current grocery store job doesn’t pay enough to move out.
2. My mother is relentless—if I ignore her even briefly, she screams and threatens to throw out my belongings.

The constant fighting and helicopter parenting have left me irritable, depressed, and unable to focus on interview prep. I noticed my temper has gotten really bad and I snap violently at the smallest things, even with strangers. I just want to take all this anger I have over these past few years and let it out.

Here is what the average day looks like for me:

* Wake up at 8 AM
* Eat breakfast
* Go to the gym
* Work at the store
* Come home to arguments with my parents
* Attempt to interview prep while being nagged
* Forced bedtime at 10 PM

Despite hundreds of hours of interview prep, I’ve been rejected after eight job interviews with no feedback. I make barely above minimum wage, have never had a girlfriend, and am constantly compared to my successful cousins (who own homes, are married, and have kids).

I’ve been working on my health—going to the gym daily for six months, my whole diet consists of basically steamed veggies with no oil or salt (not that I have a choice because we don't ever eat out), yet I still look fat and overweight. I feel like a complete failure. No matter what I do, things only seem to get worse.

I don’t know how to fix this. The job market is brutal, my home life is suffocating, and I have no social support. Even if I got an actual job and moved out, I wouldn’t know where to start with dating or rebuilding my life. Everything feels hopeless.",14,1745960674.0,findapath,4,1.0,False

Today, my work bestie (28m) who has been promoted not long ago and is in the middle of an ego trip, removed me from the groupchat i created (since teams lets anyone do anything) after I removed a colleague who had quit 1 month ago and whose profile no longer existed (she was still in the chat as unknow user).
When he added back the unknown user, me and another colleague jokingly said if that's what makes you happy then ok and right then and there i get removed.

Now, the thing is that I have attachement issues, our mutual work bestie (and my actual friend) has told me many times that she does not understand why I deal with the guy as he has repeteadly disrespected me, mocked me and belitled me.

In truth he is exausthing to deal with and never self reflects on the things he does. He's a tipical sacarstic bitchy gay (we're basically the gay trio in our department) but often uses that persona as an excuse for his shitty behavior.
As an example, he will start a conversation with me and as soon as I reply, he tells me he's busy and to stop bothering him(???) or start talking about work and when i reply he will tell me not to talk to him about work (??) But in a very condescending -shut the fuck up- kinda way, he constantly takes my food but can't even buy back a coffee for a few cents, he makes fun of my body, my personality etc but never in a way that is funny to me... he brags abt blocking me on instagram for a week and then randomly follows me, when i had achieved a project at work he was bragging about not giving a fuck about it (???) It's seems so little to me but after +2 years I just feel like punching him in the face. Especially considering he has already made me cry 3 times... and if he hated me then i dont get why he insists on hanging out with me? And imagine all that with the bitchy rupaul drag race gay attitude.

Now he removes me from the very group I created from a frankly very mindless act of removing a user that no longer exists like idk... it's supposed to be funny? Especially given that him and that colleague were as little friends as I was with her. It's so silly and I really think i'm making too much out of it but I'm so angry that I don't know what to make out of myself.

I'm curious what you think my next steps should be for cosmetically improving my smile.

I feel like my teeth look like three different colors. The front six are the ones with composite bondings on them. I originally got them to cover brown/white flourosis spots and make my teeth have an even shade, but that was probably 5 years ago.

My current thinking is to whiten and get new composite veneers, but I'm not really sure. I felt like they stained pretty easily even though I do brush twice a day, and rarely drink coffee/red wine/etc.

I had also thought about taking the veneers off and trying to reduce the flourosis by some other method, but the last time I spoke to my dentist about it they thought that composite veneers were the best way.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

I’m graduating this spring and moving to the Bay Area this summer to start my job in San Francisco. I grew up in the DC suburbs and have been in Boston for college, so I’m used to having easy access to things like coffee shops and walkable neighborhoods.

That said, I really value a sense of community, and I’m not interested in a social life centered around bars or drinking. I also love warm weather, so Oakland felt like a good cultural and lifestyle fit.

I currently have the option to sign a lease in the Prescott neighborhood of West Oakland, near the West Oakland BART station. The commute is amazing — only ~15 minutes door-to-door to SF. But the neighborhood is very residential, and there aren’t really cafes or restaurants within walking distance. I’d need to take BART or bike to get to anything social. I don’t bike yet, but I’m considering starting, since biking would make a lot more places accessible within 10–15 minutes and would be cheaper than BART.

So essentially, I’m trading a lively, walkable neighborhood for an affordable place with a great commute and the potential to save money (and maybe develop some new habits like biking). I’m torn because I want to make the most of my early 20s, but I’m also a homebody at heart, and being away from constant temptation might be good for my budget and well-being.

Would love to hear: Is this a good tradeoff? Will I regret not being in a more social, walkable area?",2,1745960476.0,eastbay,3,1.0,False

1kaysdj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kaysdj,Which Regular Show drink do you see Ben drinking in either their regular states or in smoothie form?,"Before you all say none MIND you this is the same guy who’s willing to drink the most disgusting Smoothie flavors like Lamb and Sardine, and Turnip and Wheatgrass with Ginger.

Now let’s start with the drinks.

Cool Cubed Slushie Big Swig sized: ok this is from the episode Cool Cubed. It contains real glaciers imported from the Arctic and you’re supposed to drink it really really slowly. What happens if you drink it too fast? Well just ask Thomas he got a brain freeze you should never want to get and long story it involved Mordecai and Right fighting an actual fucking slushie in Thomas’s brain that’s trying to freeze his brain core. (Yes Im dead serious)

Ok I know the Omnitrix’s failsafes would absolutely protect Ben and make sure he doesn’t end up like Thomas but let’s be honest we all know Ben would still drink this fast not caring. Though it would be funny to see the Clerk’s reaction to Ben just not listening to his warnings about the slushie and drinking the Cool Cubed fast only for nothing to happen thanks to the watch’s failsafes.

2. Mississippi Queen: it’s a drink made from a lot of random shit that makes you trip the fuck out like you’re on a whole lot of drugs. Just look at what happened to Mordecai, Rigby and Benson, we all remember the Mississippi Queen and the song from when we were kids watching the episode. Just look at the ingredients.

Ingredients: 

Kimchi
Pasta Sauce
Sashimi
Chocolate syrup
Soy Sauce
Clam shells
Shrimp
Mayo
Hot Chili Peppers

I can honestly maybe see Ben only drinking the Mississippi Queen with either Rook or Gwen and Kevin if it was in a Smoothie form and they didn’t know about the hallucinogenic effects (lol imagine Ben going through that).

3. Rig Juice- ok let’s be honest this is probably the most unlikely drink for Ben to even want the taste even if it’s in a Smoothie form. Rook is a maybe since aliens in the show are known to eat and maybe some weird shit. Actually wait no I don’t think even Rook would want this considering the side effect it has. In fact arsenic is allegedly believed to be concentrated in Rig Juice which would likely cause arsenic poisoning if ingested. (How did Mordecai and Rigby drink this with no side effects). 

Here are the ingredients to it:

1 can of RadiCola
Frozen Fruit Punch Concentrate
A bottle of hot sauce (plus the bottle)
Sugar Frosted Sugar Bombs
Candy and candy wrappers
An apple
Sardines
Pickles and pickle juice
An orange(?)
300 milligrams dextromethorphan (DXM)

I don’t believe Ben would ever drink this even in smoothie form. He may like some nasty flavors but Im sure he would realistically draw the line at Rigby’s abomination of a drink (though I can still see the Omnitrix hopefully protecting from arsenic poisoning)

4. Coffee Bean’s Coffee: ok let’s all be honest this is the most normal option for Ben. Hell Im 90 percent sure Ben would drink Coffee and he probably has offscreen. Not to mention Coffee in real life is used in a lot of things, Cake, Ice Creams, a bunch of foods, probably some foods, and yes there are Coffee Smoothies just look it up on youtube some people even mix it with Bananas. 

If Ben was approached by the Coffee Bean and translator and signed a contract just like Mordecai and Rigby i can one hundred percent see him accepting any Coffee or even Coffee smoothie that the Coffee Bean makes. 

However this is all assuming the Coffee Bean doesn’t show him how it’s made, the moment the Coffee Bean squirted his Coffee out his nipples (yes this happened look at the 5th imagine) you could see Mordecai and Rigby immediately looking disgusted before it flies into their mouths.

The moment Ben sees this or if this happens to him I can immediately see him not wanting the coffee or even almost gagging. Rook is a maybe for the Coffee 

Which one of these drinks do Yall think Ben would drink in either Smoothie form or in their regular drink forms?

Is the after life and paranormal stuff possible? Sure. Probable? I don't think so, but I'm not narcissistic enough to say I know either way.

My dad passed away unexpectedly in January of this year. A few days later, my sister and I were at my mom's house and went outside to grab some stuff out of her car. My parent's house has a set of motion-detector spotlights on the eve of the roof that haven't worked in over 10 years according to my mom (the lights are on constant power, not a light switch). As my sister and I are in the driveway, the lights start flickering, shut on an off about a dozen times and then .... nothing. 

Oooookay.

Fast forward two weeks later and I wake up one morning and walk into my office (I work from home). My desk is always neat, everything just so (I can't stand clutter and neatness makes me more productive). That morning, it looks like a tornado hit the desk. My papers are scattered all over the place, the coffee cup that holds my pen and pencils is tipped over, everything is everywhere.

I don't have pets, the office door was closed, and I was the only one in that house that night. No windows open, no breeze to make a mess.

The weirdest and most disconcerting thing I found, though, was when I walked around to the front of the desk, I found an earbud on the floor. But, I haven't used these earbuds in years. The case was **shut** **closed** and still in the back of my desk drawer where I left it, the other earbud still in the case.

How? How in the hell did the earbud get out of the case and end up on the floor? These buds are older and I haven't used them in years, let alone touched them. 

Oh, and I have an house alarm that was set that night, so there's no possibility that someone broke in.

I'm still freaked out.

I know that the colour isn't obviously the same, but what's your opinion based on teh pictures? (shape and colour)

Another major concern is that with the passing of the years, specially these last months I feel like my gumline from that tooth is receding, but (it is objectively a bit higher that the others), but I don't know if that's just my obsessing about it or it just got worse. The thing is that I brush my teeth three times a day, I use waterpik at night and I use a special mouth rinse for gum care in the morning and in the night. So I try to take good care of my teeth and gums. Does that gumline from that specific tooth look I'll swollen or with gingivitis to you?

The first two pictures are with the selfie cam and the last three are with the rear cam (I don't know which camera is more representative of the real perspective).

I'm gonna ask for a second opinion from another dentist because I don't know if the current one is doing a good job.

I left everything I had ever known behind and moved alone to London (I'm from the US). I did this while being in a relationship (Mateo, M 26), knowing that we wouldn't see each other for a long time and that it would be difficult. Just a day before moving, I reconnected with an old friend of mine(Julian, M 22), and we started talking more often, just texts and sometimes a call here and there. It was never with any other intention until, after a while, he confessed he had feelings for me — and I realized I felt the same way. 

I didn't act on it, we never did, but we talked more and more and the feelings grew for both of us even by just trying to be friends. I felt that the best thing to do was to stop talking, as much as it hurt not to talk, I thought it was the best decision given the situation. I had already been having problems with my boyfriend, Mateo, and the distance was becoming more and more noticeable. We knew it was something that could happen, and out of respect for our relationship and everything we had lived together, I decided to keep trying. If things didn't work out, I didn't want it to be because of someone else, but because we had genuinely tried.

However, even without speaking to Julian, my feelings for him kept growing, and things with Mateo weren't getting any better. So I decided to end my relationship with Mateo, not even thinking about getting with Julian, it was just too many arguments and distance was too hard, as much as it hurt and as much as we cared for each other we were growing apart. 
I broke the no-contact rule with Julian before officially ending things with Mateo - not asking anything from him, he didn't even know I ended things with Mateo for a while after I did— I just wanted to talk to him, to know how he was. 

But everything changed. Julian didn't talk the same way anymore, is as if he’d put on a wall between us to protect himself. He told me that he understood the position I was in, but that it hurt him a lot that I had stopped talking to him, and that during the weeks we weren't in touch, he realized that the last thing he needed right now was something like this in his life, that he has other priorities and he doesn't want to feel again the way he felt when we stopped talking. And I understand him, and I understand that I deserve to be alone after getting feelings for someone else while being in a relationship, I am aware that this might just be my karma, believe me I feel pretty guilty, even though nothing physical happened. I really did try to fight falling for him, I really really tried to get him off my mind. 

But I love him. God I'm crazy, head over hills, wanna shout it from a roof, in love with this guy. I want to ask him to give me a chance, to really try this with me. I understand why he feels the way he does and that he doesn't deserve it, but I'm falling apart over him. If he allows me, I won't let things go wrong - I will give him the best version of myself. 

Instead I told him I get it, it was a messed up situation and I never meant for any of it to happen, that I still very much care for him and want what's best for him and that everything he's feeling is valid, that I have to take accountability for my actions and live with the consequences of my choices, that I hope to see him in a future and talk things out.

But I really really want to try this. I feel that we’re walking away from something so good. I just wanna show up to his house or fly over there and ask him to grab a cup of coffee and talk. It's almost 2000 miles by plane. WIBTA if I did this? Should I just leave him be? Or should I wait? Till the situation is not so recent. ",2,1745959994.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

So, when I was 6 years old and I started school, I met a friend named Linda (29F) we were both with no sisters just brothers and we bonded, we lived in a small village so of course our families knew each other and because of us they also grew closer. 

So me and Linda were inseparable, we went through high school together (same class), also on the beginning of our studies on the same group. We had other best friends along the way that we made in high school which I still talk to (two of them) and we were a really fun group. But only me and Linda were together in the same university during studies. 

This happened until Linda knows someone that she falls in love. He lived abroad and they immediately introduced one another to each other’s families. So, eventually he started pulling Linda away from us, controlling her via gps, controlling who should she hang out with, when, etc. at first, I really liked him because he was the love of my best friend and whenever they had a fight I would try to bring the peace, so he respected me. But, when I saw how controlling he was, I told Linda that I don’t think she should be in that position, I also called him out when he was controlling her and abusing her verbally. When I called him out, he obligated Linda to never hang out with me again (specifically) and slowly divided her from the whole group. 

We lived in the same village but I never saw her again, she even stopped studies. Her parents invited me to her wedding and I didn’t want to go, but my parents said we should go for the sake of the family friendship (they invited my parents too). 

I saw Linda for the first time after almost a year and a half in a wedding dress, and when we locked eyes we both were emotional and I noticed her eyes full of tears. Her mum and grandmother (who loved me like their own) when they came to greet me, both of them bursted into tears, and that was the last day I saw Linda until she went to live abroad. 

For almost 10 years I only saw her twice just in the blink of an eye, and that’s it.
I can’t say I didn’t think of her sometimes, in the beginning I thought of her more often but as the years passed by, I thought of her time by time, about her well-being, about her life with that man..

I heard some rumors that she is struggling in marriage but never something specific, that’s until couple months ago when I met her father with her son in our town’s coffee shop. I greeted him.. when I looked at Linda’s son, I asked “is this…” and froze, and her father said “yes, he is”. I asked the little boy if I could hug him, and he said yes, I hugged him, kissed him on the cheek and he hugged me back 🥹. Linda’s father referred to me as “this is your mom’s friend” and that was it about that day.. 

After some days I heard that she got divorced, she was physically abused, her husband cheated on her, had an affair with her boss (there were rumors they even share a kid together) and that was the last straw for her and decided to end the marriage. The rumors got confirmed by Linda’s mum to my mum at a funeral they met in town. I never could ask about her because I didn’t want to sound like I am happy about her situation or like I want to gossip about her, and to be honest… some kind I was happy for her… not because of what happened to her, but because she got free of him finally!

Not many days passed by when we saw the news of her ex husband’s death. We still don’t know if it was an accident, if he k*lled himself, or what was the cause of his death, no one ever told that. 

This brings us to yesterday when one of our best friends (which is still my best friend, we’ll call her “Ana”) saw Linda in the town and decided to go and talk to her. She called me immediately after and told me every detail. Linda was emotional and on the verge of tears when they met, and they shared contacts and also decided to meet for coffe, them and me, tomorrow🥹. 
Also, one of other best friend of us (which we still are pretty close) that lives abroad and is in town said she would join too and I never in my whole life imagined our group again together, let alone me and Linda together after 10 years with no contact. 

I thought I don’t feel love for her anymore, I didn’t love her nor  hate her, but I got this scary feeling for tomorrow, and something inside me is so excited, I feel like I will meet my child self.  I never hated her, and I never got angry of her decision to leave me.. I got angry of her decision to ruin her beautiful life that she had created until he came along. And I felt angry and sorry, only for her… but, I know that things happen for a reason so I never judged her for her decisions, it was her life and her mistakes to live. We’re none perfect and we all make stupid decisions, the thing is: heart always go back to her home.. 

No matter her reaction, cold or warm towards me, I will still try to talk only about our childhood, beautiful things we did, I want her to feel safe and bring to her just a glimpse of her beautiful life into the hard times she is going through.

I mean I genuinely thought he was interested but even though he was so confident, he wasn’t making a move so I decided to tell him I was interested within 2 months of interaction. 

Fast forward, when I did tell him, he told me he flirts with everybody, that yes he thinks I’m attractive but he’s not looking for anything serious and how he’s been single for 6 years since his ex broke his heart, etc. Basically, not interested. Moved on. Recently, I’ve saw a picture he posted on FB ( we’re friends on FB), and he had a new gf, which is great ! The thing is I noticed she looked like me, just older, which I thought was kind of … strange ? 

Edit : FYI, he doesn’t know me. I would go to the coffee shop and this is where he would flirt, and talk about himself a lot. I would listen, smile and interact a little. All I can say is maybe he noticed I was shy.

We’ve spent centuries searching for the meaning of life, the secrets of the cosmos, and the ultimate answer to existence. But what if the answer has been inside us—literally—this whole time?  

Pee.

1. The Golden Ratio? More Like the Golden Shower. 
   - The Fibonacci sequence, the golden ratio—nature’s perfect patterns. But what’s also golden? Pee (when you’re hydrated). Coincidence? I think not.  

2. Pee is the Original Philosopher’s Stone.
   - Alchemists spent lifetimes trying to turn lead into gold. Meanwhile, our bodies turn coffee, burgers, and existential dread into liquid gold every day. We are the alchemists.  


3. Pee Breaks: The Great Equalizer.  
   - Kings, peasants, Elon Musk, your weird neighbor—everyone pees. If that’s not universal harmony, what is?  

4. The Sound of Pee Hitting Water is the Music of the Spheres.  
   - Pythagoras talked about celestial harmonies. Next time you pee, listen closely. That’s the sound of cosmic balance.  

Conclusion:  
42 might be the answer to life, the universe, and everything… but 42 *what*? My money’s on 42 ounces of pee. Stay hydrated, my friends.

1kaykqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kaykqz/aita_for_wanting_to_quit_my_summer_job_early_even/,"AITA for wanting to quit my summer job early, even though it will make things harder for my (nice) boss?","Hi! I’m a college student working a summer job at a small souvenir shop on a student contract until July 1st. The shop is owned by a young woman who’s really kind and respectful. She hired me recently, and I officially started work last Thursday. (I came in on Tuesday and Wednesday before that for some unpaid training/observation but not many people came to the shop so we pretty much just talked, looked around the items in the shop and I helped put prices on the magnets)



The issue isn’t her, it’s her future mother-in-law (FMIL). The souvenir shop is physically connected to a clothing boutique run by the FMIL, and she’s always there with me. Before I came the young boss was the only worker in the souvenir part of the shop and the clothes store already had a student working there for some time. The owners are the only ones with the keyes so I work with the FMIL and the student 2 works with the young boss. The FMIL is nice on the surface, jokes around, she has made me coffee a few times, however, whenever I make a mistake she she acts like I’m stupid and talks to me in a condescending manner. 



On my real first day, I came in, helped the FMIL with some declarations for the clothes and her shop and a customer walked in at that moment. As she was looking around, I approached the customer and introduced some handmade jewelry, and the customer smiled and walked away. As she was leaving, we kind of stumbled around each other in the small shop. The FMIL immediately came at me, accusing me of scaring off the customer. She asked how could I have done that, like I had insulted her personally. She also swore a few times at me during the explanation of what I should do in the future. When I tried to explain myself, she got even more upset. Since then she has been watching my every move like a hawk, I'm pretty much on eggshells all the time. If anything is off, for example, if there is some dust, if something is out of place, crooked magnets etc, I get blamed, even though I have only just arrived to my shift and her future daughter in law/my boss has been there the whole day. If I place something in a way she doesn't like she moves it all around and lectures me how this is better (She does this generally though, not just after me but after her future daughter in law as well). 



 I try to learn and ask questions, but that sometimes makes her look down on me or act like I’m stupid for not “thinking”, saying that I'm just supposed to assume that.  A customer bought two small hand-painted pictures. I put them in a bag together, not knowing that there was a special way to wrap them with paper in between (it was the first time I’d sold those, and no one had ever shown me the proper way.) FMIL scolded me harshly and told me it was “common sense,” while waving her fingers in circles around her head as if to say I was stupid. 



One day I worked the morning shift. I arrived 10 minutes before the opening and she came earlier, and she told me that she vacuumed my part of the store instead of working on her own part because our part was just so dusty she couldn't leave it like that. I worked the afternoon shift the day before. I swept and washed the floors as well. It really wasn't dusty or dirty but nontheless, she said I should wash the floor again. So I did. The customers kept coming in and out and I washed the floor every time after they left. 



Just today, she had a personal friend come in looking for a gift. The FMIL started showing her things from the souvenir part which is supposed to be *my* part of the shop. I followed along and helped, trying to stay involved because it’s literally my job. The woman bought some glasses and a bottle of wine, and the FMIL offered to wrap it after the woman finished browsing. She told me to go tear off the declararion label on the bottom of the glasses but I had to go the the back to use water because they were not budging otherwise. Anyway, I asked, “On all of them?” and she said yes. So I did what she asked. While I was doing that, she wrapped the gift herself and then when I returned, she was angry that I was doing what she told me to do. She swore again, even saying “jebem ti mater (I'm fucking your mother literally, but used more so in a way like damn it)”. I didn’t argue, I just stood there and said “okay” until it passed.  



She never really yells, but she’s talking to me louder than usual and in a very condesending and accusing manner when explaining what I did wrong. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells. I have literal stomach pain, nausea, and anxiety before shifts. I’ve worked in a bookstore before and never felt like this.  But I am trying and really am listening to all her criticism. 



The young boss is very nice to me and whenever I have a question, she answers calmly and politely. However, I feel like complaining to her about the FMIL won't do much because she’s marrying into this family and I understand that the peace in the family is more important than me. She’s not part of the problem, and I don’t want to make things harder for her. If I leave, she’ll be left alone short-staffed. I’m even scheduled to work a 12-hour shift later next month so she can attend her boyfriend’s (FMIL’s son’s) diploma ceremony. 



The thought of quitting feels humiliating and I feel really sorry to the young boss. I thought about walking out in the middle of my shift today but didn’t because I didn’t want to leave her in trouble.



So… AITA if I leave this job early?

  
TLDR; 

I’m a student working a summer job in a souvenir shop. The owner is kind, but her future mother-in-law (who co-runs the space) treats me with constant criticism and verbal jabs even though I'm new and trying my best.. I’m sick with anxiety every day. I want to quit, but I’m afraid it’ll leave the nice boss overwhelmed. AITA if I leave anyway?

I started dating my fiancé about a year ago, on April 25th, 2024. I remember asking him if he wanted to go to Micro Center with me because I wanted to build a PC. At that point, my fiancé had probably built multiple. We walked around Micro Center and didn’t buy anything. I remember that day so well—I kept stealing glances at him. He was wearing this cotton maroon shirt, and his beard had grown in since the last time I saw him. I just kept thinking how handsome he looked. He would make silly little jokes, and I loved the way he laughed.

Afterward, we ended up going to this coffee shop, and I pulled the trigger—I asked him out. In that moment, I was afraid of rejection, afraid he might turn me down, because the last few weeks between us had been complicated. But I’m so glad I asked that day.

A year later, he proposed on April 25th, 2025, at the botanical garden—because he knows I love flowers and plants. He made sure the people who love me were there that day to celebrate with us.

I don’t penny pinch and I don’t think I’m that cheap because i was also taught to live in the moment, enjoy life, and try new experiences especially in my 20s. I now make a lot of money ($200k) at a well known tech firm.

My girlfriend comes from a middle-class/rich family but they are quickly burning through all their money in retirement. Before I met her she didn’t save a penny. I convinced her to start a savings account. Her parents pay for 1/3 of her rent, and she makes around $70k. We both live in New York. I pay for all our dates, which I’m totally fine with.


I travel often (mostly ski trips) and prefer to spend my money on experiences. I make my own coffee and will always try to save money where I can but I travel 4-5 times a year.

For the first time my girlfriend and I are traveling together internationally. I naturally choose the cheapest ticket but she chooses a more expensive one. Her reasoning being she gets rewarded on that airline and she will be more comfortable on the long flight. Fine. She is paying for the ticket because her parents are burning through their retirement and she is making an effort to be more independent by paying for it herself.



This led to an argument with how she spends her money and how I enforce my spending habits on her. When she made a savings account I told her to save 3-4 months of living expenses (I don’t know if she’s done that), have a brokerage account so she can invest (she hasn’t done that) and start just being more aware of her purchases (I see her making an effort). 

I know it’s her money and I really do try not to be controlling but her future will be a part of my future and I worry about these values that maybe I think of her future more than her. Idk that sounds super controlling. I do love her and would definitely marry her but I don’t want to feel like a father when it comes to this stuff. 

She’s been really wanting to travel with me and has a travel budget which I am sure is less than her emergency savings probably because of her parents. I’m not sure how to approach this talk.

After weeks of daily testing and thanks to my slightly outdated central system at home, I had a solid reason to put this DIY ductless mini split to the ultimate test.

**Build Quality and Design**

The design is compact and modern with a clean white finish that blends effortlessly with most interiors. Measuring just 11 inches deep, 31 inches wide, and 8 inches high for the indoor unit, it felt surprisingly unobtrusive even in my smaller guest bedroom. The outdoor condenser, though relatively modest in size, felt robust and stable once installed. Its parts exhibit clear attention to durability, with anti-corrosion Goldish Fin technology guarding against wear and tear from exposure to the elements. Over the last month, we encountered two major rainstorms, and through it all, the condenser looked as pristine as day one.

**Ease of Installation**

As someone who usually can't assemble furniture without help, I was skeptical about the DIY claim. However, the system's 25-foot pre-charged quick-connect line set and plug-and-play wiring truly simplified the process. Surprisingly, it required no vacuuming or specialized tools, and following the instructions was straightforward (though I watched a few YouTube tutorials to be extra cautious). My cousin and I managed to secure everything in under half a day, and we didn’t even want to rip each other’s heads off by the end. It was genuinely stress-free, a massive win for any DIY project!

**Performance and Efficiency**

The KLIMAIRE mini split boasts a whopping 19 SEER2 rating, which immediately caught my attention while browsing through options. Practically speaking, this translated to noticeable energy efficiency over the month-long usage. My electricity bill saw minimal deviation, even though I had used it extensively for cooling during warm afternoons. Even more impressively, it maintained steady temperature control when tested during a freakishly cold evening; I was comfortably warm while temperatures dropped into the twenties outside.

This system is designed for diverse climates, with performance guaranteed down to -13°F for heating and up to 5°F for cooling. One night, I set it on Sleep Mode, and the room temperature was adjusted so seamlessly that my partner didn’t even realize we switched from the regular central heating. Turbo mode came in handy during a particularly humid afternoon, cooling my 550 sq. foot office space in just under 15 minutes.

**Smart Connected Features**

Connecting this mini split to the Smart Life App was straightforward. I leveraged voice commands via Alexa multiple times to set ideal temperatures or adjust its 3D airflow. It brought a level of smart comfort that I hadn’t experienced with other air conditioning systems. Even while I was out grabbing coffee, I adjusted the temperature remotely, ensuring a cozy living room upon my return. The convenience factor here cannot be overstated—it’s made laziness an art, and I’m here for it.

**Upsides**

- Straightforward, truly DIY setup requiring no professional tools.
- Excellent energy efficiency with a powerful SEER2 19 performance.
- Corrosion-resistant materials for outdoor durability.
- Smart integration with Alexa and Google Home.
- Capable of handling extreme temperature ranges.

**Limitations**

- The remote controller feels somewhat dated and less user-friendly compared to the app.
- Installation instructions, though detailed, could have used bigger visuals for clarity.
- Slightly noisier than I anticipated when running on Turbo Mode.

**Competing Products**

Compared to peer products like MrCool DIY and Senville mini splits, the Klimaire option stands out for its comprehensive installation kit and no-vacuum-required installation. Similar systems, while efficient, often necessitate professional intervention or additional purchases for setup. The Senville range does feature a sleeker remote control design, however, its outdoor unit is bulkier and less ideal for compact patios or walls. In terms of performance during extreme weather, particularly colder temperatures, KLIMAIRE holds its edge over most Competitors.

**Worth Every Penny**

Although it sits comfortably in the mid-price range for ductless systems, the value proposition makes this unit a worthwhile investment. Between cutting energy costs and removing the need for technician fees, it quickly pays for itself. From the corrosion-resistant features to multi-stage filtration for improved indoor air quality, the item felt purposefully designed to complement everyday living.

1kayd1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1kayd1m/fasting_significantly_increases_lifespan_here_is/,"Fasting significantly increases lifespan. Here is scientificly proven tips and evidence. Fasting prevents cancer, slows aging, prevents cardiovascular disease and a lot more.","Fasting, when practiced with care and intention, is one of the most powerful ways to support a longer, healthier life. It’s not just an ancient tradition — modern science now shows that fasting turns on deep survival and repair systems in the body. These systems help slow aging, fight disease, and increase your natural resilience. When you fast, you give your body time to clean up damaged cells, burn excess fat, and reset your hormones — all things that keep you younger, inside and out.

One of the easiest ways to begin is by simply shrinking your eating window. This method, called time-restricted eating, means you eat all your meals within 8 to 10 hours each day — like from 10am to 6pm. You’re not necessarily eating less, but you’re giving your body a break from constant digestion. This gentle change improves your metabolism, lowers your insulin levels, and encourages cellular cleanup, a process called autophagy that removes old, damaged parts of your cells.

As you get more comfortable, you can stretch your fasting window to 16 hours — eating only within an 8-hour period. This 16:8 rhythm is one of the most popular and sustainable ways to fast. It supports fat burning, improves your energy levels, and activates longevity-related genes that help your cells repair themselves more efficiently. And the best part? You still get to enjoy real, satisfying meals every day.

Once in a while, doing a full 24-hour fast can offer even deeper benefits. This gives your digestive system a true rest and supercharges cellular repair. Some people choose to do this once or twice a week — just a simple day of skipping meals while staying hydrated with water, tea, or black coffee. It’s a powerful reset for both your body and your mind.

Every few months, some people go deeper with a 3-to-5-day fast or a special fasting-mimicking diet that provides some nutrients while still activating fasting pathways. These longer fasts have been shown to support stem cell renewal, reduce inflammation, and even help the body clear away pre-cancerous cells. Done safely, they can feel like a biological “spring cleaning” — sweeping out old, damaged tissue and making room for healthy new growth.

What you eat between fasts matters, too. A diet rich in vegetables, legumes, healthy fats like olive oil, and moderate amounts of fish helps protect the benefits of fasting. On the other hand, sugary snacks, processed foods, and white flour products can undo your progress and stress your body all over again. Fasting and nutrition go hand-in-hand for long-term vitality.

It’s also important to stay hydrated. Water is essential during any fast, and if you go beyond a day, a small amount of salt or mineral-rich broth can help keep your electrolytes balanced and prevent dizziness or fatigue. Always listen to your body — fasting isn’t meant to be a struggle. If you feel unwell or overly drained, it’s okay to stop, adjust, and try a gentler approach next time.

The research is clear: fasting lowers the risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline. It boosts brain function, sharpens focus, and even mimics the effects of calorie restriction — the only intervention proven to extend lifespan in multiple species. In essence, fasting isn’t about denying yourself food. It’s about reclaiming your body’s natural rhythm and unlocking its incredible potential to heal, renew, and thrive for years to come.",5,1745959268.0,immortalists,5,0.73,False

I run a coffee roastery, and we have many, many SKUs. Some of those SKUs are the same coffee, just with a different name. I'm trying to create a spreadsheet that's better than the one we currently use, which has been pieced together over a decade by several different people. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXxHoggVQYlv4CcEPiYUa0M4aYWkwEN4-KcLLPLjZbI/edit?usp=sharing

On the Setup tab is where I'd like the lookup table to be. Each week, on Monday morning, we change the drop-down menus there to the new coffee of the week. 

Orders are imported to the following tabs/sheets: `WS`, `Retail`, `EXTERNAL1`, `EXTERNAL2`. The `Bags` sheet takes everything from `WS` and `Retail` and puts them onto one sheet, which tells us how many of each SKU to prep. 

I think I really only need help getting the `Setup` and `Bags` sheets to communicate easily. I can do it just fine, but I'd like a way that's better than writing a `sumifs()` for the three blends, a different one for the core coffees, and a different one for the single origin coffees. Hope that makes sense. If I could just use the same `sumifs()` (or whatever) for all of them, that'd be great. 

I'd also like this sheet to be flexible. Customs sometimes want private label coffees (note the `CUSTOM COFFEE x`), and those are sometimes one of the other coffees (say, `Blend 1`), but will get put into a different bag or labeled differently. The reason this is important is because they should be bagged separately, but the pounds of roasted coffee required should still get calculated to the `Demand` tab (which I haven't yet started). If I could be shown a way or figure out a way to easily calculate those to their corresponding coffees, that'd be great. Currently, it's just modifying each one's `sumifs()` to sum up a specific column/cell. Maybe I add another row below the name of the coffee where I put what actual coffee is inside that bag? 

I have a `database` tab that I started to try to come up with a solution for this, but nothing is really happening there.

Hoping this all makes sense. It's hard sometimes to explain the inner workings of something you've been doing for so long, to someone that hasn't been. Hah.",2,1745958917.0,sheets,0,1.0,False

1kay2fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kay2fn/aita_for_this/,AITA for this?,"Iam a 16 year old female and I've been having problems with a friend, for some context we've been friends since 8th grade and we are sophmores now, but recently she's really been getting on my nerves, let's call her zoo, and I jst don't really want to be her friend anymore.

For context zoo and me both are kinda losers in school standings but recently I've became more popular due to me finally coming out of my shell and making new friends with girls who get me, which I think had annoyed her. And I will admit before I continue I have been talking shit about her, but only to two of my close friends Avery and Tay (fake names and both girls) l, but I personally think I have a reason to, for starters every time someone checks in on me, for example about two weeks ago while I was having a hard time sleeping due to my allergies one of my semi close friends in my group for the project asked me if I was ok since I couldn't sleep well, and as I told her I was tired, zoo budded in and said ""I got no sleep last night and running off of coffee and I'm fine"" and things like this has happened a few times, and I will put the in to becuase it comes in later, I have a bf, I'll call him Xander..and he's a total sweetheart and very talented, well he has wrote a song for me, and he's currently writing another for me, when I showed my group she flat out glared at me, like I offended her gf (she's gay btw) and just other things like that. Not to mention she tells everyone she has a bunch of things wrong with her such as..ADHD,ADD, dislexic, deaf in one ear (but she still listens to music and can hear us fine) and has Achromatopsia in one eyes, and alot more. I don't believe any of it for a second, I've did research and none of it lines up, especially since she doesn't have a 504 or any acomidations.

I also wanted to mention this morning she came to my bf and asked him to tell her what I've been saying about her and other things, but as soon as I got there he told me about it and asked if I wanted him to handle it which I said no, and continued on with my day.

And because of all this I've told my friends, but recently she's been doing passive aggressive things, like slamming doors in my face, glaring at me, and other things...and I admit the more things she did like this the more I talked to my friends about all this, and my comments about her have gotten ever more rude, and truthfully I haven't likeher in about a year, and tried cutting off our friendship a while ago.

And honestly I do feel like the asshole, but I also feel justified, what should I do, and I'm not apologizing for anything I've said about her.

UPDATE: I've noticed by the comments I haven't fully explained, she says she's fully deaf, and takes medicine for both ADHD and ADD, which from what I've heard you can't do, duel them clashing and canceling each other out. Not to mention at but our school has a grade/ attendance system that shows all a student acomidations and diagnosis for teachers, and hers only say ADHD, I thought I'd clear that up, I'm not using any of her ""problems"" against her and she does say that she's had all of these things her entire life. I didn't make this part clear, when I say talking shit, I meant I was stating things that's happened and my personal feelings in the situation, I never lied about anything bad about her and I never threw dirt, I realized how I put things where different then how all you where taking it, sorry.

UPDATE 2: I just saw the comment calling me an ableist, and let me say you can call me whatever you like, I admit I am a by of an asshole, but I am not an ableist, I have my own issues myself, I am fully diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and slight anger issues and I am also autistic, and my brothers fully autistic, bipolar, ocd, anger issues d a few other things all diagnosed, so I am not a all an ableist",1,1745958528.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False
1kay26i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kay26i/soft_power/,Soft Power,"Tyrhiki stared at the half full glass of coffee in front of him, he wasn't a fan of the brown beverage for a very long time until he met Charles, who other than being the catalyst for his new found addiction to the drink, was also his roommate. It was rather unusual for a Drigiri, a species that could consume the beverage with no physical impediments to not be addicted to it, ever since it was introduced after first contact with the UNE it had spread like a wildfire throughout the galaxy, rapidly becoming the most consumed liquid.

''So, what kind of TV are we getting?'' Charles asked him, the human took a sip of his own coffee.

''Well, I'm torn.'' Tyrhiki replied, ''Either the widescreen Salsung '70 model D or the Ggrdsf 3.0.''

Charles raised his eyebrow when Tyrhiki mentioned the latter model. ''Really, I've never heard of that brand.''

''Neither have I, but it's the only one that came up that meets all our requirements and falls in our price range.'' Tyrhiki answered him, ''Then again the Salsung does seem like the safer option.'' Tyrhiki added.

Charles stood up, ''Well then it's settled, we'll get the model D, send me a payment request and I'll send my part of the credits over.'' The human grabbed his now empty coffee mug and walked towards the kitchen.

Tyrhiki tapped in agreement, ''Say, did you hear the news?'' he asked.

''No, I don't watch the news.'' Charles responded as he put his empty mug of coffee on the kitchen counter. ''Why, did something interesting happen?'' he asked.

''You're worse than I thought.'' Tyrhiki said with a hint of disappointment in his voice, ''Arguably the most powerful nation in the galaxy is threatening the UNE with war and you're just now hearing the news from a Drigiri.''

That seemed to entice the human. He looked up from the kitchen counter and looked directly at Tyrhiki, ''War?'' he said, ''Really, war, with the UNE?'' he asked once more.

''By the prophet's hat, yes, war.'' Tyrhiki said, ''The UNE isn't a military superpower anymore, it hasn't been for centuries!''

''Not being a military superpower and being powerless are two entirely separate things, you're a history major for Christ's sake, you should know that.'' Charles responded.

''What I always find curious is how you humans love to pretend you rule the world, like you still have half the power and influence you had after the Nirminian border wars when that clearly isn't true.'' Tyrhiki intonated the first part especially with a sense of anger that was only appropriate for what he considered to be such an unruly species.

He continued his rant, ''The human people have become weak, decadent even!'' he took another sip of his cup of coffee, after which the cup was completely empty, Tyrhiki stood up, cup in hand to place it on the kitchen counter alongside the empty cup of the human. ''Your ancestors, they were strong, powerful, disciplined.'' he pointed to Charles, ''But the current state of the UNE is deplorable at best and downright degenerate at the worst of times, it's like how your Rome fell to barbarians.''

Charles let out a small chuckle, ''I swear, you have some sort of instinctual need to go on a rant like this at least once a day.''

Once more Tyrhiki pointed at Charles, ''I'm just telling the truth!'' he responded defensively. ''By the way, did you get more of those granola bars?'' he asked, changing the topic entirely.

Charles pointed to the right most cabinet, ''If nobody else ate them, they should be in there.''

Tyrhiki nodded, a gesture he had picked up while watching human tv and reading human comics, ''Thanks.''

''It's kind of ironic isn't it?'' Charles seemingly randomly stated.

Tyrhiki turned his head to look at him while ripping the plastic packaging off of one of the bars, ''What's ironic?''

''That even the most fervent detractor of the UNE consumes mostly human products.'' Charles replied, he continued, ''Militarily speaking the UNE might've cut back on spending, still, here we are purchasing products made and designed in the UNE, preferring them even when there are alternatives.''

Tyrhiki attempted to speak but was cut off by the human, ''It's also ironic that a history major neglects this fact and that the finance major has to remind him of this, considering historically speaking the threats of embargoing the Qustro federation is what ended the Nirminian border conflict in an overwhelming UNE victory.''

At that point Tyrhiki simply felt the need to intervene, ''I doubt cushy couches and fancy clothes will save you from the great Gargon war machine!'' he proclaimed. A few seconds of silence followed before Tyrhiki once more looked Charles in the eyes, ''Also did you happen stumble upon my new set of rike jeans while doing the laundry?''",41,1745958509.0,HFY,3,0.99,False

Eventually he said, “Are you a nurse?” I was flabbergasted because I’m only 17 and in high school so I checked to make sure there was no one behind me. Very unfortunately there wasn’t and he repeated himself louder. I looked him dead in the eyes and uttered the most dumbfounded “HUH” cause what???

I told my 19yo sister about it and she said he was probably trying to gauge if I was legal before he could ask me out? But that’s so out of the blue because why would he ask if I was a nurse out of everything?

1kaxycn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartShoppingHub/comments/1kaxycn/whats_the_best_powerful_handheld_frother_thats/,What’s the Best Powerful Handheld Frother (That’s Not a Double-Loop Coil) for Cream and Coffee?,"Finding a handheld frother that combines power, versatility, and user-friendly design can elevate your daily coffee experience from ordinary to exceptional, particularly when alternating between different types of cream such as half-and-half and heavy cream. The issue at hand stems from the user's dissatisfaction with a current double-loop coil frother, which lacks the desired power and suffers from a mechanical flaw—specifically, the lower coil slipping out of place during use, requiring constant readjustment. This not only disrupts the frothing process but also leads to frustration and inefficient results, especially when working with thicker dairy products that require more force to achieve a proper froth.

To address this need, it’s essential to prioritize a frother that offers a high-torque motor, ideally above 15,000 RPM, which is strong enough to handle the density of heavy cream and similar products. A frother with variable speed settings is a valuable feature, allowing the user to tailor the frothing speed to the consistency of the liquid, whether it’s a thin milk alternative or a thick cream. Multiple speeds also help reduce splashing when starting the frothing process. Given the user’s clear preference, the design should avoid the double-coil whisk style altogether, opting instead for a more stable single-coil or paddle-style attachment, which are known for offering better control and longer-lasting structural integrity.

Aesthetics are also a relevant factor, with the user expressing a preference for a pink model. While pink is less common in professional-grade devices, several consumer-focused brands offer frothers in a range of colors without compromising on performance. Additionally, models with interchangeable attachments—such as a whisk, a mixer for powders, and a small immersion blender—add practical value and expand the frother's use beyond coffee, making it suitable for matcha, protein shakes, or even mixing salad dressings.

Professionally speaking, some of the best brands that combine high performance, color variety, and durability include Zulay, FoodVille, and Maestri House. These brands offer high-RPM motors and frequently include interchangeable heads. The Maestri House frother, in particular, has a robust build and a unique motor strength that makes it well-suited for heavy cream without requiring a double-loop coil. FoodVille also offers a model with three adjustable speeds and a powerful motor that performs reliably without the frustrating slipping coil issue.

To further enhance the at-home coffee experience, incorporating high-quality instant coffee or cold brew concentrates can be a practical time-saver. Brands like Jot, Cometeer, or Sudden Coffee (if available) offer premium, quick-prep alternatives that still deliver rich flavor. For flavorings, naturally-derived syrups from Monin or Torani’s sugar-free line provide taste without excessive sugar, and can complement various frothing bases like oat milk, almond milk, or heavy cream.

In summary, resolving the user’s dissatisfaction involves choosing a frother that balances power with mechanical reliability, includes useful attachments, avoids design flaws like slipping coils, and optionally adds aesthetic appeal. With the right tool, their morning or afternoon coffee ritual can become smoother, faster, and far more enjoyable. Would you like me to recommend specific models available in pink that meet these criteria?",1,1745958236.0,SmartShoppingHub,0,1.0,False

What can I do?,"Hi reddit. I'm (30m) having some troubles with my gf (25f) and I could really use some advice on what to do.

It's a long story so I'll drop a tl;dr already lol.
My gf had some issues with her family and work. I drunk called her and now she doesn't want to talk or see me anymore.

We met each other at her work in December 2024. She was the most beautiful and sweetest woman I've ever seen in my life, like an angel. So a couple of days later I went back with a box of chocolates with my number written on a small note inside, asking her out for a coffee. We went on a date a couple of days later and we hit it off immediately. Seeing each other almost every day, calling and texting all day from good morning to good night, going on dates, sleeping over,... At this point she was talking about having kids in the future already and meeting her parents.

Fast forward to last month, from one day to
another, everything changed when she got promoted at work. One of those promotions she didn't choose for.

I had to drive her to an work event she had to attend to because of the promotion. When i picked her up she was arguing with her aunt (she introduced me to her a couple of day before while they were videocalling) over the phone. Afterwards she explained they had THAT talk, you know, that she's getting older and pushing her to marry and have kids. Later that evening I picked her up again from the event and now she was on the phone with her dad, basically having the same talk. But now she was starting to get upset, talking about how she's not ready for a serious relationship and she has to focus on her career. I didn't think much of it because she still kissed me and cuddled on my shoulder while driving, talking about her day. We went for a drive thru milkshake and now it's her uncle calling... They had a big argument over the phone as out of nowhere he started pushing her to take her ex-bf back who she broke up with a year ago, as the uncle is a friend of her ex-bf family. She just hung up on him after a while as she was very upset, almost crying. So we kept talking in the car for hours until deep in the night about her ex-bf, love, relationship's,.. At the end she was still saying that she's not ready for a serious relationship, but also kissing me like nothing happened when I dropped her off back home and texting goodnight.

So again, didn't think much off it. I'm neither a big relationship kind of guy tbh. lve been single a couple of years now, having trust issues coming out of a toxic relationship. But she was the first woman I met since, that I thought could be the one to trust again. In hindsight I probably should've thought more about that moment maybe. Asking her what's going on between us than. But at that time it felt like nothing was wrong between us and I didn't want to push things after the whole situation with her family. So I decided to just be calm, give her some time and peace. And wait until she gets back to me.

But now is the moment where it all went
downhill fast...

The next day I had to go out with my
colleagues from work for some drinks. I normally don't drink alcohol, only on special occasions. So I told myself to only stay for a drink or 2, but we ended up getting shitfaced drinking way to much and doing cocaine. On my way home all my thoughts about giving my gf some time and peace went trough the door and I drunk called her. I didn't say anything unusual, but you know... just being annoyingly high and drunk.

The day after I texted her to apologize for it but she was very distant, taking hours to text back. This whole situation fucked my head I guess. I wasn't thinking straight anymore and instead of giving her some time I kept trying to have a conversation, but she stayed being distant. Eventually after a couple of days I called her that I want to see her so we went out for a drive thru milkshake. When I picked her up she didn't want to kiss me anymore... She showed me how she was very busy with work but also that she was very shocked with how drunk I was when I called her. That it reminded her of her real father (He's an alcoholic and she got adopted when she was 10yo but they still see eachother from time to time), bringing up past trauma's and realizing she had to work on herself first.

I told her that I understand, we talked a lot about our fathers before since they were both alcoholics, the same reason why I don't drink alcohol. I told her to give me a second chance because it wasn't the real me and that it will never happen again, but she stayed standoffish, saying she has to work on herself first. So I decided to really be calm this time, wait for her and hope for the best.

A couple of days later I told my friends about the situation. My best friends wife told me to not wait but fight for her and send her some flowers. I was hesitant at first but eventually thought ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"". So I sent her her favorite flowers and chocolates. But i got an angry text back saying that she already told me she doesnt want a relationship and definitely not after the drunken call situation. And that she doesn't find it ok for me not respecting her feelings.

I got super confused as why she went from going 100% to 0% all of the sudden over 1 little mistake, saying something like that and acting like i was nobody. I couldnt think straight anymore and we had a big fight over texts about it but her only response was that I'm only trying to make her feel guilty, that she didn't want to talk anymore and eventually ""bye good luck in your life"".

A week later I tried texting her that I'm sorry
for getting angry, I wasn't myself anymore and that I understand why she doesnt want to talk, but that I wished I could turn back time and make things right. No answer. A month went by of not talking to each other, so this Easter I tried texting her again. She's an Orthodox Christian so I know it's an important day for her. I texted her a simple happy Easter in her native language and surprise, she texted me back. But simply saying ""thank you"". I asked her how she was and she only responded with ""good"". That's it.

So reddit, what the hell do i do now? I tried forgetting about her but can't get it out of my mind and I don't know what to do anymore. The only thing that I really know is that I love her but everything I do seems to make it worse...

1kaxxcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kaxxcl/fictiontruth/,Fiction+Truth,"Hey. I want to share something personal—wrapped in a horror story called The Inheritance.

This piece is fiction, but it’s born from something real. My mother was abused as a child by someone who should have protected her. That trauma didn’t end with her. I was raised in the shadow of what he did—shaped by her pain, her fear, and the ripple effect of surviving something no one should have to.

The Inheritance explores what happens when silence is passed down like a family heirloom. When pain is inherited. When someone finally says, “No more.”

It’s dark. It’s emotional. And yeah—it’s meant to hurt a little. But if you’ve lived with trauma, or loved someone who has, maybe it’ll say something that’s been hard to put into words.

Thanks for reading. And to survivors and their children: you’re not alone.

The Inheritance

He wakes in the dark.

His mouth is dry, and there’s a weight on his chest—not just fear, but something real. Restraints. Ropes, maybe leather. Ankles and wrists bound to a cold metal chair. His head lolls forward, neck stiff. A faint humming sound surrounds him—constant and low, like a machine in the walls.

Then a click. A lamp flickers on overhead. Pale light spills into the room—a concrete basement, empty except for a folding table, a camera bolted into the far corner, and the chair he’s tied to.

He starts to struggle, breath picking up.

“Don’t bother.”

The voice is calm. Male. Tired.

Across from him, seated quietly in a padded office chair, is a man with sallow skin, thin frame, and hollow eyes. Late thirties, maybe. There’s an oxygen tank beside him, plastic tubing trailing into his nose. A handheld remote lies across his lap.

“You’re safe,” the man says. “For now.”

“What is this?” the bound man croaks, throat like sandpaper.

“You’re in my basement. Soundproofed. Secure. No one can hear you, and no one’s coming.”

Fear flickers behind the man’s eyes. “You’ve made a mistake—I don’t know who you are—”

“You will.”

The man presses a button on the remote. A low hum stops—the sound of a space heater, maybe—and silence sharpens the air.

The man breathes, slow and careful.

“You molested my mother when she was a child. You raped her. You stripped away her innocence and stitched shame in its place. You made her believe it was her fault. That no one would believe her. That no one would care.”

He lets the words sit. The other man’s mouth twitches.

“That was decades ago,” he rasps, eyes darting toward the door.

“Exactly,” the man says. “Decades for you to live your life. Get married. Have kids. Grandkids. All while she couldn’t be touched without flinching. Couldn’t be held without shaking.”

He leans forward now, voice softening.

“I’m what’s left of her. The piece that came after. I grew up with a mother who barely existed. Who couldn’t love without bleeding for it. And I spent every year trying to patch holes you left behind.”

“I didn’t—” the bound man starts, but stops. He sees something in the man’s eyes. Something absolute. Hopeless.

“I know what you’re thinking. Denial. Confusion. Maybe even pity,” the man says. “But it won’t help you here.”

He points to the blinking red light on the camera.

“You’re going to spend the rest of your life in this room. That camera feeds to an encrypted server. My attorney and two friends have the password. If I die, they take over. They’ve been instructed not to intervene. Only to observe.”

The bound man starts to shake. “This is illegal. It’s—it’s torture—”

“It’s what she lived with,” the man cuts in. “Every day. In her mind. In her nightmares. I’m giving you a fraction of that.”

He stands, revealing how frail he truly is. His hand trembles as he adjusts the oxygen line.

“I don’t have much longer. Cancer. Final stage. It’s in my bones now. Breathing hurts. Moving hurts. But this… this is what I had to do before I go.”

He begins pacing, dragging the oxygen tank behind him like an anchor.

“I could’ve killed you. Quick. Easy. But that’s not what this is about. It’s not revenge. It’s balance. You left poison in my blood. My childhood was smoke and screaming. My mother would stare at walls for hours. She never talked about you. But I saw it. Every time she flinched when I walked in a room. Every time she apologized for crying.”

The bound man starts sobbing now, a pitiful, wheezing sound.

“I was just a kid,” he says. “I was sick—”

“You were a predator,” the man snaps, stepping forward. “You chose her. You shaped her. And through her, you shaped me.”

He kneels now, slowly, painfully, and looks into the man’s eyes.

“You gave me this inheritance. Now I’m giving it back.”

Silence thickens. Only the faint hiss of the oxygen tank remains.

After a moment, the man rises again and walks to the stairs.

“Please,” the bound man says. “Please don’t leave me here. I’ll die. I’ll go mad—”

“You won’t be alone,” the man says, pausing at the base of the steps. “You’ll have your memories. That’s what she had, too.”

He climbs the steps slowly. At the top, he hesitates.

“You once told her it would be your little secret. Now it really is.”

The door shuts.

Darkness returns.

The bound man screams until his throat gives out. No one comes.

⸻

He dies two days later.

Peacefully. Alone.

In the living room upstairs, slouched on the couch with a blanket over his legs and an oxygen mask still strapped to his face. The TV glows with static. A legal envelope sits on the coffee table beside an empty glass of water and a single photograph of a woman smiling faintly, decades before she forgot how.

When the authorities arrive—days later, flagged by a friend checking on the monitoring server—they find the basement just as described in the man’s instructions. Food trays pushed toward the door. A bucket for waste. A broken man, weeping into the corner, muttering nonsense and prayers and memories no one wants to hear.

But above it all, scrawled across the wall in faded black marker, just above the camera, are five simple words:

1kaxwa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/autoelectrical/comments/1kaxwa6/ground_switched_headlights_and_how_to_trigger_a/,ground switched headlights and how to trigger a relay,"Hi all, I'm just drawing a blank on this one (thanks to new baby and lack of sleep!) and I know it's an easy one.

I'm adding some Diode Dynamic SS3 fog lights to my '05 Honda Element for winter commuting, and I have a harness circuit drawn out for the lights to 1) have the integrated DRL active with ignition on, 2) only be able to activate the fogs when the parking lights are on, and 3) turn off when the high beam circuit is active. Everything runs off a separate circuit block (think Painless CirkitBoss style copy) so the circuits are fused and isolated at the trigger points. I attached at a really, really rough sketch.

I'm having trouble with the high beam trigger to turn off the fogs as this is the first ground switched auto i've had to tap into for a relay trigger. The OEM plug has two 12+ and one ground. Activating the high beams equals one 12+ and now two grounds. I am just stuck at this point finding the trigger to turn off the fog relay. Any suggestions while i make some more coffee?

 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern 8 oz cup with lid is more than just a simple container. Advanced designs incorporate features designed to enhance usability and environmental impact.

**Material Composition:** Understanding the material used in the cup and lid is paramount. Options range from paper and plastic to more sustainable alternatives like plant-based plastics (PLA) and compostable paper. The choice of material directly affects the cup's durability, heat resistance, and environmental footprint. Premium options often feature thicker, double-walled paper for better insulation and reduced condensation.

**Lid Security and Fit:** A secure lid is essential for preventing leaks and spills, especially when transporting hot beverages. Key considerations include the lid's material, closure mechanism (snap-on, screw-on), and vent hole design. High-quality lids create a tight seal around the rim of the cup, minimizing the risk of accidents. Some lids also feature raised edges or textured surfaces for improved grip.

**Heat Resistance:** The ability to withstand high temperatures without deforming or leaching chemicals is critical for hot beverage applications. Materials like polypropylene (PP) are commonly used for their heat resistance and durability. Double-walled cups offer enhanced insulation, keeping beverages hot for longer periods while remaining cool to the touch. Look for cups certified safe for hot liquids.

**Eco-Friendliness:** With increasing environmental awareness, many consumers prioritize eco-friendly options. Compostable paper cups lined with PLA and lids made from renewable resources are gaining popularity. These cups break down naturally in commercial composting facilities, reducing landfill waste. Recyclability is another important factor, though the availability of recycling programs varies by location.

Key features of the best 8 oz cups with lids include:
    * Durable construction
    * Secure lid seal
    * Excellent heat resistance
    * Eco-friendly materials

 ## Core Benefits

8 oz cups with lids provide a multitude of benefits for both businesses and individual consumers.

**Enhanced Convenience:** These cups are designed for on-the-go use, providing a convenient way to enjoy hot or cold beverages without the need for cumbersome reusable containers. The lids prevent spills and leaks, making them ideal for commuting, traveling, and outdoor events. This convenience is particularly valuable for busy individuals and businesses serving customers who are always on the move.

**Improved Hygiene:** Single-use cups with lids offer a hygienic solution for serving beverages, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. This is especially important in settings where hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals, schools, and public events. Disposable cups eliminate the need for washing and sanitizing, reducing labor costs and ensuring a clean drinking experience for everyone.

**Reduced Waste (with Eco-Friendly Options):** While disposable cups can contribute to waste, choosing eco-friendly options like compostable or recyclable cups can significantly reduce their environmental impact. These cups are designed to break down naturally or be repurposed, minimizing their contribution to landfills. This provides a more sustainable alternative to traditional plastic cups, aligning with environmentally conscious consumer values.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

**Are these cups suitable for both hot and cold beverages?**
    Yes, most 8 oz cups with lids are designed to handle both hot and cold beverages. However, it's essential to check the product specifications to ensure they are rated for the intended temperature range. Cups designed for hot liquids often feature thicker walls and heat-resistant materials.

**Can I microwave these cups?**
    It is generally not recommended to microwave disposable cups, especially those with plastic lids. Microwaving can cause the cup to warp, melt, or leach harmful chemicals into the beverage. Always transfer the beverage to a microwave-safe container before heating.

**Are the lids leak-proof?**
    The leak-resistance of the lids varies depending on the design and material. High-quality lids with a tight seal are generally leak-resistant, but it's essential to ensure the lid is properly secured before transporting the cup. Avoid overfilling the cup to prevent spills.

Sometimes I can even smell it before I enter a dog owners house, as soon as I approach the front door.
They are literally that pungent and stinky.
Going into a dog owners backyard is even worse, there's always like a hundred piles of feces hidden in the grass like landmines, and the stench is unbearable. Whenever it rains, I can hardly even go in my OWN backyard because the stink of my neighbors dog crap gets so disgusting and so strong I can smell it all the way over on the other side of my own yard.

Elizabeth ""Ellie"" Gage wasn’t the type of person who stood out in a crowd, and she'd spent most of her life trying to avoid being noticed at all. Her dark brown hair, always a little too messy to be neat, and her round, brown eyes were easily overlooked in the sea of students that filled her college campus. To most, she blended in with the beige walls and faded posters, a quiet background character in her own life.

But Ellie was used to that. She was good at it.

She had always been good at blending. Good at hiding.

It wasn’t that Ellie lacked ambition—she had just never been sure where to focus it. She had tried, briefly, to be a biology major. She liked the idea of helping people, of making sense of the world, but the biology department had its own idea of what success looked like, and Ellie didn’t quite fit into that vision. So, she tried something else. Then another. Then another. Until all that was left was uncertainty, and the quiet resignation that perhaps she didn’t belong in any of the places she’d been.

By the time she boarded the Greyhound bus home for the summer holidays, she had made the decision. She was done. She had dropped out. She couldn’t bring herself to say the words to her parents, but they’d see it when she came through the door. The truth, plain as day, in the way she carried herself, in the absence of her shiny new degree.

The holidays were always supposed to be a time for family—getting together, sharing stories, and laughing around a table. But Ellie wasn’t coming home for the holidays this year. She was coming home to deliver news. The news that, in her mind, had been inevitable for months: that the life she’d tried to build for herself at college wasn’t hers. It wasn’t meant to be.

She sat on the bus, staring out the window at the roads that blurred by. The grey sky matched the color of the asphalt beneath, both heavy and unyielding. Ellie closed her eyes for just a moment, the hum of the bus soothing in a way she hadn’t expected, and before she knew it, the hours slipped by like water over rocks.

When Ellie awoke, the first thing she noticed was the unnatural stillness. Her head ached, a familiar fuzziness from too many hours of sleep, but that was nothing new. It was the silence that unsettled her.

The bus, which had been humming steadily along just a few hours ago, was now completely motionless. She blinked, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep, and glanced out the window. Instead of the highway stretching on before her, she saw only a dusty, empty street. Buildings stood in neat rows, their facades weathered but sturdy. There were no cars. No people.

Ellie sat up with a jolt. The sun—if that’s what it was, though the sky was an unbroken stretch of black—hovered just above the horizon, casting a faint, dim glow over everything. It was as though it had forgotten how to shine. It almost looked like a solar eclipse if not for how bright it was.

Her heart began to race as she peered around the bus. The seats were empty. Every single one. The overhead lights flickered weakly, and for a moment, Ellie wondered if she was still dreaming. She pinched herself, her skin stinging from the cold air, but it did nothing to answer her questions.

*Where was everyone?*

She grabbed her phone, her fingers numb as she scrolled through the dead screen. No signal. She tried calling her parents, then her best friend, but the call failed each time. The buzzing of her own pulse was louder than the phone’s empty ring tone.

The bus doors opened with a soft hiss, and Ellie stepped out into the street, her boots hitting the cracked asphalt with an odd finality. The town around her looked perfectly normal. No signs of destruction, no obvious reason why it had emptied out. It was like someone had simply forgotten to turn the lights on.

""Hello?"" Her voice cracked as it broke through the silence, but no one answered.

She walked toward a small café, the windows fogged over as if someone had just cleaned them. The door was unlocked, the bell above it jingling faintly as she stepped inside. The smell of stale coffee hung in the air, and there, on a table by the window, sat a half-finished cup. Steam curled up from the mug, as if the person who had been drinking it had only just stood up to leave.

The chair was still pulled out, the thin grooves in the wood from where it had been dragged across the floor.

Ellie felt a chill run through her. She looked around the room, hoping for a sign, some indication of where everyone had gone. But all she could see were empty chairs, untouched plates of food, and the hum of silence that pressed in from all sides.

She couldn’t remember how long she stood there, staring at the empty town around her. But the longer she stood, the clearer it became: there was no one here. No one left to help.

Ellie’s fingers fumbled over her phone as she tried to dial her mother’s number. Her hands were shaking—whether from the cold or something deeper, she couldn’t tell. She held the phone to her ear, waiting for the reassuring ring, the familiar sound that would bring her back to reality.

But the ring didn’t come.

Instead, the phone vibrated once, twice, and then fell silent.

“Hello?” Ellie spoke into the device, her voice trembling, too soft in the stillness of the empty street.

There was a pause. Then a distorted whisper, so quiet at first that she thought she had imagined it.

*Don’t turn back...*

Ellie’s breath caught in her throat, her pulse thudding in her ears. She pressed the phone closer to her ear, as if that would bring the voice into sharper focus. Maybe it was a prank, or just some weird glitch.

“Hello?” she tried again, more forcefully this time. “Mom? Dad? Is anyone there?”

*Don’t turn back... don’t turn back...*

The voice came again, the words stretching out, warped and unrecognizable, but unmistakable. The whispering grew louder, distorting into something unintelligible, as if the phone itself was groaning in protest, the sound rattling through the speaker like a broken machine.

Her heart thumped in her chest. She yanked the phone away from her ear, but the whisper didn’t stop. It only grew more frantic, repeating the same words over and over, the voice now a crackling hiss that seemed to seep from the very air around her.

*Don’t turn back...*

The words were heavy, pressing down on her chest, choking the breath from her lungs. Ellie’s hands were clammy as she frantically ended the call, but the whisper lingered in the quiet, like an echo she couldn’t shake.

For a moment, Ellie just stood there, staring at the blank screen, the silence now somehow more deafening than it had been before. She swallowed hard, her throat dry, and glanced around the street. It was still empty, still silent. The world felt... wrong. As if something was watching her from the shadows.

But there was nothing.

Just the whisper.

And the unsettling thought that maybe, just maybe, the world had turned its back on her long before she’d ever gotten off that bus.

Ellie’s mind was racing, but her body moved mechanically, as though it had already accepted the truth her mind refused to. She had to keep moving. She had to find someone—anyone.

The town stretched out before her, its streets empty and silent. There were no footprints in the dust, no sign of recent activity. The air was thick with an unsettling stillness, like the place was holding its breath.

She walked past rows of houses, peeking through windows that showed nothing but abandoned rooms, curtains drawn tight as if the homes had been forgotten in a hurry. But the most unsettling thing wasn’t the absence of people—it was the little things that didn’t make sense. The half-eaten dinner on a table, a child’s bike abandoned in the middle of the sidewalk, the door of a small shop wide open, as if someone had left in the middle of their workday, leaving everything untouched.

Her legs grew tired, but she couldn’t stop. She needed answers.

As she turned the corner onto a quieter street, something caught her eye. A flash of metal—polished chrome and twisted wreckage—shining dully in the dim light. She froze.

A car.

The car had crashed into a light pole, its front end crumpled like paper, smoke still curling up from the engine, but the strange part was... the driver's side door was wide open. There was no one in the seat. No sign of the driver anywhere.

Ellie walked cautiously toward the wreckage, her breath catching in her throat. The car was an old sedan, something that looked like it had been well-maintained before whatever had happened. The airbags had deployed, the front windshield shattered, but the driver—whoever they were—was gone.

She kneeled beside the car, peering inside. A bag lay on the passenger seat, still zipped up. A coffee cup rested in the cup holder, its contents long spilled, the dark liquid staining the seat beneath it. The engine continued to sputter, barely alive, as if the world hadn’t yet caught up with what had happened.

The strangest thing, though, was the car’s position. The driver had clearly been heading toward town, but there was no skid mark, no sign that the person had tried to stop or swerve. They had simply... vanished. In the middle of driving.

Ellie stood and glanced around, hoping for some kind of explanation. Maybe the person had run off after the crash, but the street was empty. No footprints leading away from the wreck. Just more emptiness.

She could feel the weight of the world pressing on her chest again. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up, and she took a step back, her hands trembling.

*Where did they go?*

The thought lingered in her mind as she took a few shaky steps away from the crash. A voice, faint but distinct, echoed in her thoughts, *Don’t turn back...* It sent another chill down her spine.

Ellie felt her pulse quicken, the silence growing louder around her. She had to keep moving. Had to find out what happened. What *was* happening. But the more she searched, the more she felt like the town was closing in on her, like the answer was out of her reach.

Ellie stood there, staring at the empty driver’s seat, her chest tightening as she tried to make sense of what she was seeing. The wrecked car, the missing person, the silence—it was all too much, too impossible. She could feel the world unraveling at the edges, like the fabric of reality was beginning to fray, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.

Her legs felt like they might give out at any moment, the weight of it all pressing down on her. Every step she had taken since waking up in that bus had led her further into a nightmare. There was no one. Not here. Not anywhere. She was alone. Completely alone.

And the worst part? She wasn’t even sure when it had happened. When the world had stopped turning. Had it been days? Hours? She couldn't tell anymore.

Her breath caught in her throat as the truth finally settled over her, like a cold wave crashing down. There was no one left. No one to call, no one to run to, no one to help.

The tears came then, sharp and sudden, burning her eyes as they spilled over. She sank to her knees in the dust, her body trembling with the weight of her isolation. The ground felt strangely solid beneath her, but it didn’t make sense. None of it made sense.

She reached out a hand, touching the twisted metal of the car’s wreckage, her fingers brushing against the still-warm metal, as if the car had somehow just been abandoned in the blink of an eye. She closed her eyes and let her hand fall limply to the ground, her chest heaving with each breath.

“Where are you?” she whispered into the air, her voice hoarse and broken. There was no answer. Just the hollow sound of the wind, the distant hum of the wreck’s sputtering engine.

The world had emptied itself, and Ellie was the last person standing in its wake. It didn’t matter how much she searched, how much she called out for someone—anyone. The world was gone. The people were gone. And Ellie, in that moment, was nothing but a shadow of someone who had once had a place in it.

Her heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice, her mind a whirl of confusion and grief. She fell forward, her forehead pressing against the dusty ground in front of the wrecked car, as the sobs wracked through her body. It was too much. It was too impossible.

But the tears didn’t stop. And the silence didn’t break.",1,1745957800.0,selfpromotion,1,1.0,False

This model stands out to me as a disruptive approach in the food and beverage industry, leveraging personal spaces to create unique coffee experiences.

Given the rising trend of experiential dining and the growing emphasis on community connection, I see significant potential here. The low overhead and startup costs make it accessible, while the personal touch can differentiate it from traditional cafés.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this model. Have any of you considered or ventured into similar business ideas? What challenges and opportunities do you foresee in this space?

I hope you all were safe and sound during the power outage!

My parents (in their 60s) will be traveling to Lisbon this Sunday for a short 2.5-day trip.  
It’s their first vacation without us children — and actually their first real getaway in years, because of work.

They’ll arrive late in the evening around 10 PM, and start exploring the city the next morning. They’ll be staying in **Chiado**, so they’ll have a pretty central base to get around.

I put together a rough itinerary (with a little help from ChatGPT!) and would love to hear your 2 cents!

I know 2.5 days isn’t enough to see *everything* in Lisbon — I just want to make sure they hit the most important highlights. 

My dad especially wants to see the beach, so I added a little trip to Cascais.

Thanks so much for any advice you can share — really appreciate it!

The bells over the café door jangled twice when he stepped inside with a quick stutter, like an echo tripping over itself.  
The smell hit him first: scorched coffee, wet paint, and something sour underneath. He didn’t remember it ever smelling like that.

His eyes caught it immediately on the fourth item down:  
*Wynn’s Special — $5.25*  
He stared.  
*I don’t have a special.*

Behind the counter, a woman in her fifties with a red bandana and an easy smile caught his eye and lit up.  
""Auggie Wynn,"" she said, wiping her hands on her apron like she’d been waiting years. ""Look at you. We were wonderin’ when you’d wander home.""

It scraped something raw inside him. He smiled automatically, the kind you give at funerals, and ordered a black coffee, foregoing small talk.

The woman poured it fresh, humming a tune he couldn’t place. When she turned to ring him up, August glanced back at the blackboard.

The “Wynn’s Special” was gone.

He blinked hard.  
*Just tired from the long drive. Just rattled.*

He paid cash and stepped back out into the sunlight, coffee burning the chill off his palms.

Everywhere he moved, heads turned half a beat late. Smiles arrived too soon or too wide. The street felt too narrow now. The sun too heavy. His name stuck to the air like a scent he couldn’t scrub off. Halfway down the block, he caught himself glancing at the shopfront windows. Watching himself walk. Making sure he was still there.
