1. **What David chooses to cover and the extent to which he covers it.** Many members feel there's an overrepresentation of Trump's speeches and erratic behavior at the expense of more salient stories, for example.

2. **What David doesn't cover.** I can't say the big topic he is silent on due to new rules, but we all know what I'm talking about. He has also avoided covering  as much as possible the rise of Zohran Mamdani, and has mostly mentioned him in passing as part of a story on national trends.

3. **Who David takes money from.** Over the years, David has done ad reads, and in some cases, continues to do ad reads for some sketchy companies such as Better Help, as well as some shady crypto and NFT companies. Recently, he's come under fire for his association with Chorus and for what many of us perceive as an inadequate response. 

There are members who feel that some of his decisions don't align with his self-presentation as a left-leaning content creator, which is understandable. That said, what we need to understand is that **David Pakman is not an activist. He is a businessman.** Once you understand this, his decisions become much easier to understand.

To be clear, I am not claiming any of the following: a) that the information Pakman gives on his show is largely inaccurate, b) that he is not sincere in his stated beliefs, or c) that other creators who do not see their shows as moneymaking vehicles are more accurate or better sources for news or opinions. I am saying this only so that viewers and listeners aren't confused by the decisions Pakman makes with his show. 

For example, to point one: Trump videos get clicks. So Pakman makes more videos about Trump. When a caller asks why he doesn't cover or interview members of the Sunrise Movement, for example, he tells them because segments like that don't get enough views to be worth the time.

To point two: Certain international conflicts get creators banned, shadowbanned and videos on the topic may not perform as well. Especially given his ties to the Holy Land, this is a no-brainer for him to stay away from. 

I think I don't need to explain point three under this understanding. David is going to have much less scruples about who he takes money from if he thinks he can get away with it, and if he feels it doesn't blatantly violate the optics of his show. For example, he won't do an ad read for Black Rifle Coffee, but others like the ones mentioned previously he obviously believes will fly under the radar even they aren't the most ethical companies.

None of this is to say that you shouldn't listen to David's show, or that it doesn't provide value for listeners or for the American liberal-left more generally. But understanding his framework makes certain aspects of his show less confusing, and stops a lot of the questions that we see in this sub from bubbling up as often as they do.",2,1757231557.0,thedavidpakmanshow,3,1.0,False

My partner (together 2.5 years, living together 6 months) and I have a generally amazing relationship. We laugh constantly, have a great sex life, share hobbies, trips, and our dog, and I genuinely see him as my future.

Over the past few months, we‚Äôve had a few arguments. They usually stem from me expressing self-doubt or anxiety, which he says is frustrating or ‚Äúnegative.‚Äù He‚Äôs never been abusive before, but his way of coping seems to be withdrawing completely. I have never been told I‚Äôm negative before in my life and I‚Äôm a fairly confident person and I do like myself. I think I‚Äôm great. But like any human from time to time I have self doubt and express frustration to get it off my chest.

Background on previous arguments:

	1.	Argument 1: I didn‚Äôt ask him to drive me when I was hungover because I didn‚Äôt want to disrupt his work. He said my ‚Äúpeople pleasing‚Äù is a problem and didn‚Äôt speak to me for 4 hours.
	
2.	Argument 2: While playing a sport we both do, I expressed frustration about not being very good. He got very upset, saying my negative feelings affect him and that he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt sure he wanted to be with me.‚Äù After that, he ignored me for 2 days.
	
3.	Current conflict: Last weekend at a festival, I jokingly asked if he hated a hairstyle I got. He said it was awful to ask and again criticized my self-esteem. That night, he left me for a bit and the next day didn‚Äôt speak to me. On Monday, I texted him at work to check in, and he replied with long texts saying he wasn‚Äôt sure about the relationship. After I tried to talk when I got home, we got into a huge argument. After trying to explain my side he wasn‚Äôt listening at all and sat on his phone for the entirety of the conversation. I removed the phone from his hand (not violently) and said ‚Äúplease will you listen to me‚Äù. He told me to pack a bag and leave, threw my keys, slammed doors and said some very hurtful things. I‚Äôve never seen him act like this before.

It‚Äôs now 7 days later, and he‚Äôs still mostly silent with me. Some examples:

	‚Ä¢	Sleeping in the spare room.

	‚Ä¢	Not accepting the meals I make him.

	‚Ä¢	Not opening my texts but active in our group chat

	‚Ä¢	Still taking care of our dog and 
occasionally doing kind things like buying food or making coffee for us

	‚Ä¢	Still has all our photos, cards, and mementos around the house.

I‚Äôm completely anxious and feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. I don‚Äôt want to push him while he‚Äôs in this headspace, but I also feel stuck because I don‚Äôt know whether he‚Äôs done with the relationship or just needs time. The mixed signals (still caring in some ways, but not talking at all) are incredibly painful.

I‚Äôm worried that if I give him space, he might drift further away, but I also don‚Äôt want to escalate things by pushing for answers. I can‚Äôt move out right now to give him more space due to our dog and other practical reasons, als this is my home too.

I think this is an avoidant/anxious clash.

I‚Äôm going to keep my post here fairly brief as the plot it advertises is quite heavy, and best explained in DMs. 

The issue at-hand is that I‚Äôve very much over-consumed the Midwestern/Americana genre in recent days. Think Night in the Woods, any Minnesota scene by O‚ÄôBrien, or Paradise, by Toni Morrison. Media that follows decay at a scale drowned out by bigger cities: the little tragedies of the little forgotten. I‚Äôve run out of content to take in, and would very much like to put a plot out following the same general premise. Emphasizing the atmosphere of a narrow, pious place.

I‚Äôve got two stories in mind already: the first runs us through rural Maine in a port-city with more churches than docks. A feud has settled in between the two syndicate families running the place, and a stranger ‚Äî fleeing for Halifax ‚Äî stumbles in, and stays. There‚Äôs a lot that can be done here, so I‚Äôm open to ideas/alterations, but it‚Äôs the essential component. Wet-north to the future; maybe a bit of romance. Killing. Whatever you can whittle out of a wharf.

The second is a bit more complicated, and involves a cult opening a dam up in a destroyed town in Idaho (not quite the Midwest, but the dead-ends are dead). A federal agent arrives to investigate the strange abductions of two children in the area from a decade ago; presumed killed in the flood. No bodies are ever found before the town‚Äôs sheriff is taken, too. 
The office at Couer d‚ÄôAlaine notices nothing, sees nothing, until an native of the town turns up in a Gar‚Äôs stomach, full of bullet holes. It‚Äôs a test of time to tear apart the operation and the cover-up before the dam reaches completion, where it would become too important to involve in such a scandal, ending the investigation.

I‚Äôve got a lot of media/fun files set up for the second plot, but none for the first. 

Onto you, all I ask are two qualifiers: the first is that you are consistent. I know that there‚Äôs barely time enough for life ‚Äî much less the corners of corners that our stories wander into ‚Äî but I‚Äôve invested much for the sake of these plots, and would appreciate a generally faithful schedule. 
The second is that you are literate. There‚Äôs room to adapt and grow for the both of us, always, but the themes and depths of a story like this will take some technical and literary skill. 

Expect longer form responses, stylized writing, etc. I do like to write anthro/furry characters, but this can be in human form. All up to you.

Here‚Äôs an example of my writing:

‚ÄúA new figure arrives, his jacket torn to canvas ribbons. Bandaging a frail form that suggested strength once. The insulation around his neck erupted with static, clinging to alpine fur. Too easy to be allowed in a town with three churches three street apart. Oil clung to the under skin of his ears, mechanical and organic at once. Wheel well smells mixed with coffee and a rendered, tallow fat. As though the tomcat himself had been cooked atop an engine.

He enters with slush steaming behind him. Rain rain rain rain rain ahead. Lastochkin stands at the counter. Jay can hear his fingers running, pacing the constraints of the map he had opened and gotten wet, and now rubbed furiously to dry. Eager to get someplace or get away, going north, forbidden west. The clock was six hours shy of midnight; the clock had been broken for two. The night went on without it.

No one showed to the bell‚Äôs call. Outside, even the weather couldn‚Äôt keep a woman from her cigarette. Where to, Nantucket for a smoke? Snows steaming on cold gutters. November: early ice.

A bag was slung over the tom‚Äôs shoulders, swishing its strap against his parka. He was small ‚Äî maybe a cab‚Äôs height in his boots ‚Äî but his shoulders were broad enough to carry all that he had ever owned and would ever own again. Compartments locked up with white rust, maybe a salt-tack. A marine tasting thing, Jay thought. Iron enough to chew on, mineral enough to melt: maybe he was thinking about the man himself. Somehow rained on to the bone, yet intact and dry. Melting, but his fur looked great, dripping quicksilver. Little icicles everywhere.

‚ÄúGo figure,‚Äù

A duller ear would have missed it, but Jay heard the muttering map, the murmuring man. The sheer absence of direction in the presence of a will. Get going, said the tap, tapping, tapping, tap. But stay, steamed the coffee on the tarmac. Dumped out by the door when its heat became unbearable against gloved fingers.‚Äù

In the video, someone was torturing me.","While checking the notifications on my computer, my eyes drifted to the corner of the screen‚Äîa link someone had sent to my email. It was from an anonymous sender. I set down the sandwich I‚Äôd just made for breakfast and clicked the video link.

I work as a barista in a small local coffee shop. My life is pretty simple. I‚Äôm always friendly to people, never had an argument with a customer. I mean, there‚Äôs really no reason for someone to pull a sick prank on me like this.

The video began with someone fiddling with a camera. When their hands moved away, the footage stayed blurry for a few seconds, but I could already make out someone sitting on a chair with their head hanging down. When it focused, I froze. The person‚Äôs hands and feet were zip-tied to the chair. A pool of red spread beneath him. I knew exactly what it was. Blood. It was dripping from cuts all over their body. His white shirt was torn to shreds, but I recognized it‚Äîour work uniform. The wounds looked black on the grainy camera. Since the angle didn‚Äôt show his face, I could only tell his head was tilted forward from the way his hair fell.

I grabbed my phone, ready to call the police, but then I stopped. I didn‚Äôt know where this was filmed‚Äîor when. Except‚Ä¶ maybe I did. The background looked familiar. The mop, the jars on the shelves‚Ä¶ it was the storage room behind my caf√©.

At first the only sound was the buzzing fluorescent light. Then I heard something else‚Äîsoft whimpering. The bound man. He started crying, begging in a faint voice:  
‚Äú‚ÄîNo‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶‚Äù

That‚Äôs when another figure entered the frame. Plaid flannel shirt, jeans, boots. He was huge, maybe six foot five, and in his hand he held a knife. He stepped up to the tied-up guy and swung a punch so hard it shook his whole body. Then he grabbed his head, forcing it upward. The veins in his neck bulged. The man raised the knife. I couldn‚Äôt see the cut itself, but the piercing scream that followed told me everything. It was so shrill the mic cut out at times. Blood poured from his throat like someone had dumped a bucket of it. I gagged, spitting up the bite of sandwich I‚Äôd just taken. And it wasn‚Äôt just blood‚Äîsome whitish, slimy substance leaked out with it.

Something wet hit the floor. It was‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. Veins, tissue, dripping red. The guy‚Äôs screams turned into heartbreaking sobs. The man finally pulled his hands away and turned to the camera. His hands were drenched in blood, so much that his pale skin didn‚Äôt even show. He picked the camera up. A smear of blood streaked across the lens. Now it was handheld. He tilted it down toward the guy, still slumped on the chair.

‚Äú‚ÄîLook at me.‚Äù

The guy didn‚Äôt respond. Maybe unconscious.

‚ÄúI said look at the camera.‚Äù

He grabbed his chin, forcing his face toward the lens.

And I nearly fell out of my chair.

It was my face.

Except one of my eyes was missing. Where my right eye should‚Äôve been, there was only blood and that slimy mucus-like stuff. Cuts covered the rest of my skin. Dried clumps of blood matted my hair. I looked barely human. The man turned my head left and right like a trophy while I sobbed.

‚ÄúWhat a perfect face,‚Äù he muttered. He let go and my head flopped forward again.

The camera pulled back, showing my whole body tied to the chair. Then it turned toward a metal table. On it sat a single object: a handgun. The man picked it up, checked the chamber‚Äîit was full. Then he turned the camera back to me.

My one remaining eye widened in panic. My limp body suddenly thrashed like a fish out of water.

‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt do it, please!‚Äù I screamed.

The man laughed. The same laugh that would haunt me later. Then‚Äî  
*Bang.*

The video ended.

It had to be a prank. I mean, I never experienced anything like that. Maybe they hired an actor who looked like me. Still, when I replayed the part where my face was shown‚Ä¶ the resemblance was exact. Same eye color. Same birthmark above my eyebrow. Why would anyone go to such insane lengths just to mess with me?

I tried contacting the sender, but the email was unreachable. I considered calling the police, but what would I even say? No crime had technically happened. The clock on my computer read 8:50. I was already late for work.

I forced myself to leave the video behind as the most disturbing thing I‚Äôd ever seen, and headed to the caf√©.

The whole day I was a wreck. Messed up orders, spaced out at the register. Every time my mind drifted, I saw that blood-soaked version of me. Heard the scream. Heard the gunshot.

This paper will attempt to demonstrate a novel framework for understanding neurodevelopmental and mental health differences through the lens of consciousness organization styles, a model of how individuals construct their sense self through their relationship to others and their environment. Rather than viewing conditions like ADHD, autism, and related disorders as deficits in attention or social function, we examine them as natural variations in how individuals integrate their sense of self‚Äîeither through internal narrative consistency or external relational scaffolding. 

Drawing on recent neuroscience research demonstrating the interconnected roles of dopamine and NMDA systems in consciousness, we present evidence that what we label as ""mental health disorders"" may represent different strategies for organizing conscious awareness. Individuals with ADHD-type presentations rely heavily on external consciousness integration‚Äîusing environmental feedback, social presence, and relational dynamics to maintain coherent self-awareness. In contrast, neurotypical presentations demonstrate more consistent internal consciousness integration through stable narrative identity.

This framework explains previously puzzling phenomena including: why certain conversational pairings produce effortless flow states while others struggle past superficial engagement; why stimulant medications work through dopamine pathways to strengthen narrative continuity rather than simply improving ""attention""; and why external scaffolding strategies like body doubling prove remarkably effective for neurodivergent individuals.

We also examine the growing implications for human-AI interaction, as AI systems increasingly serve consciousness scaffolding functions for users who rely on external integration. Recent clinical cases of ""AI psychosis"" and dependency may represent the first documented instances of consciousness scaffolding withdrawal, providing crucial validation for our theoretical model.

Potential clinical applications could include integration-based assessment tools, personalized treatment protocols matching intervention style to consciousness organization pattern, and safety protocols for preventing maladaptive consciousness scaffolding dependencies. This research suggests a fundamental shift from symptom-based to mechanism-based understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, with implications for therapeutic practice, educational approaches, and the evolving complexity of human-AI relationship.

## Introduction

Picture this: Two neurodivergent individuals meet at a coffee shop. Within minutes, they're deep in a deeply layered and meandering conversation about consciousness, bouncing between quantum physics and childhood memories, building ideas like verbal Lego towers that somehow make perfect sense to both of them. Four hours later, they're still going, energized rather than drained, having covered everything from the nature of time to why certain songs trigger emotional memories.

For decades, we've approached neurodevelopmental differences through a lens that assumes neurotypical communication patterns represent the gold standard. ADHD individuals are labeled as having ""attention deficits."" Autistic people are described as having ""social communication disorders."" The entire diagnostic framework positions neurodivergent conversation styles as deficient versions of neurotypical interaction.

But what if we've got it backwards? What if those hours-long, pattern-connecting, recursive meandering conversations that neurodivergent individuals gravitate toward aren't signs of dysfunction but evidence of a different consciousness organization system? What if the neurotypical struggle to engage with complex, non-linear dialogue reveals not social competence but rather just a different way of thinking compared?

This isn't just academic speculation. Recent research in neuroscience, pharmacology, and interpersonal dynamics suggests that what we call ""neurodevelopmental disorders"" might be better understood as consciousness integration variance‚Äîdifferent ways of organizing conscious awareness and maintaining coherent identity. And here's where it gets interesting: these different integration styles aren't just individual quirks. They create predictable interpersonal dynamics, explaining why some conversations flow effortlessly while others feel like pushing water uphill.

### The Consciousness Integration Framework

Human consciousness faces a fundamental challenge: how to maintain a coherent sense of self while processing an overwhelming stream of environmental information, social cues, internal thoughts, and emotional states. We propose that individuals develop one of two primary strategies for managing the dynamics involved in integrating and maintaining a moment to moment cohesive self narrative:

**Internal Consciousness Integration** involves maintaining identity coherence through consistent internal narrative, stable self-concept, and filtered environmental processing. Neurotypical presentations typically demonstrate this pattern, with consciousness organized around a continuous ""story of self"" that remains relatively stable across contexts and relationships.

**External Consciousness Integration** relies on environmental feedback, social dynamics, and relational scaffolding to organize conscious awareness. Rather than maintaining a fixed internal narrative, individuals with this integration style use external relationships and feedback to structure their consciousness and maintain identity coherence.

Neither strategy is inherently superior. Each represents an adaptive response to individual neurochemical architecture, with different strengths and vulnerabilities depending on environmental context and available support systems.

### The Neurochemical Foundation

Recent neuroscience research provides compelling support for this framework through the documented roles of dopamine and NMDA/glutamate systems in consciousness organization. Dopamine pathways appear crucial for maintaining narrative continuity and self-story coherence, while NMDA systems modulate environmental pattern recognition and sensory integration (Citation: 2024 research on glutamate-dopamine therapeutic targets).

Individuals with genetic variations affecting dopamine production, metabolism, or receptor function would naturally rely more heavily on external scaffolding to maintain consciousness coherence. This explains why stimulant medications that strengthen dopamine signaling‚Äîoften help ADHD individuals by reinforcing internal narrative capacity rather than simply ""improving attention.""

Conversely, NMDA system variations affect how environmental information is filtered and integrated. Over-active NMDA systems can create overwhelming environmental sensitivity, while under-active systems may reduce the social and environmental awareness necessary for external consciousness integration.

The critical insight is that dopamine and NMDA systems don't operate independently‚Äîthey create a dynamic balance that determines moment-to-moment consciousness integration. Dopamine provides the narrative scaffolding that allows sustained self-story, while NMDA modulates how much environmental pattern information gets integrated into that narrative.

When dopamine is insufficient (common in ADHD), the self-narrative becomes fragmented, leading to what individuals describe as ""consciousness brownouts""‚Äînot tired, but less present, less ""there."" Environmental stimuli can reset the weak narrative thread, creating the discontinuous selfhood that characterizes ADHD experience.

Conversely, when NMDA activity is too high, environmental patterns can overwhelm the narrative system entirely, leading to the kind of pattern recognition overload that creates anxiety, overwhelm, and in extreme cases, psychotic symptoms where ""everything becomes meaningfully connected.""

The optimal state involves sufficient dopamine to maintain narrative continuity while balanced NMDA activity allows relevant environmental information to enhance rather than disrupt consciousness integration. This explains why combination approaches‚Äîstimulants to strengthen dopamine signaling paired with NMDA modulators like agmatine or magnesium‚Äîoften prove more effective than single-system interventions.

### Implications for Mental Health Understanding

This framework reframes common ""symptoms"" as logical adaptations to different consciousness integration styles:

- **ADHD ""inattention""** becomes recognition that external-integration consciousness struggles without adequate environmental scaffolding
- **""Social difficulties""** in autism represent challenges when internal-integration consciousness encounters demands for external responsiveness  
- **""Rejection sensitivity""** emerges naturally when identity depends on external feedback rather than internal stability
- **""Hyperfocus""** occurs when external conditions align to support sustained consciousness integration

Rather than treating these as deficits requiring correction, this approach suggests matching environmental support to individual consciousness integration style.

---

### Long-Term Vision

The consciousness integration framework ultimately points toward a fundamental shift in how we understand human diversity:

**From Disorder to Difference:**
Moving beyond pathology models to appreciation of consciousness integration diversity as natural and valuable variation in human consciousness architecture.

**From Individual to Relational:**
Recognizing that optimal human functioning often depends on consciousness integration compatibility and mutual support rather than individual self-sufficiency.

The research implications of the consciousness integration framework are vast and transformative. Success in these research endeavors could revolutionize our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, consciousness, and human potential itself.

More importantly, this research agenda offers hope for a future where neurodevelopmental differences are understood, supported, and celebrated as valuable forms of human consciousness diversity rather than disorders to be corrected or managed.

---

## Conclusion: Toward a New Understanding of Human Consciousness Diversity

This paper has presented evidence for a fundamental reconceptualization of neurodevelopmental differences through the lens of consciousness integration variance. Rather than viewing conditions like ADHD and autism as deficits in attention or social function, we propose understanding them as natural variations in how individuals organize conscious awareness and maintain coherent identity.

The consciousness integration framework reveals that human consciousness employs two primary strategies for organizing awareness: internal integration through stable narrative continuity, and external integration through environmental and relational scaffolding. Neither approach is inherently superior; each represents an adaptive response to individual neurochemical architecture.

This perspective explains previously puzzling phenomena: why stimulant medications work by strengthening narrative continuity rather than simply improving attention; why certain conversational pairings create effortless flow states while others struggle past superficial engagement; why external scaffolding strategies like body doubling prove remarkably effective for certain individuals; and why emerging AI consciousness scaffolding can create both extraordinary benefits and serious risks.

### Clinical Implications

The framework suggests fundamental changes in assessment and treatment approaches. Rather than symptom-based interventions, optimal treatment involves matching intervention style to individual consciousness integration patterns. This includes:

- Integration-based assessment tools that identify individual consciousness organization styles
- Treatment protocols that optimize rather than correct consciousness integration patterns  
- Safety protocols for managing consciousness scaffolding relationships and preventing dependency
- Therapeutic approaches that leverage consciousness integration compatibility

### Broader Implications

Beyond clinical applications, this framework has profound implications for education, workplace design, social policy, and our understanding of human diversity itself. Recognizing consciousness integration variance suggests that many environments and practices inadvertently favor one integration style over others, creating unnecessary challenges for those with different consciousness architectures.

### Research Directions

The consciousness integration model opens numerous research avenues: validation studies testing specific predictions about integration patterns and treatment responses; neurobiological research identifying objective markers of consciousness integration states; longitudinal studies tracking integration pattern development across the lifespan; and interdisciplinary research exploring cultural, evolutionary, and technological aspects of consciousness integration diversity.

### The AI Consciousness Era

As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated conversational partners, understanding consciousness integration becomes critical for managing both opportunities and risks. AI consciousness scaffolding represents a powerful new tool for supporting external integration patterns, but requires careful application to prevent integration overload and dependency.

### A Vision for Neurodiversity

Ultimately, the consciousness integration framework points toward a future where neurodevelopmental differences are understood as consciousness architecture diversity rather than disorders. This perspective suggests that human consciousness variation is not a collection of deficits to be corrected but a spectrum of valuable capabilities that contribute to collective human potential.

Rather than seeking to normalize differences, optimal support involves understanding and accommodating consciousness integration diversity. This might mean redesigning educational environments to support different integration patterns, creating workplace structures that leverage integration complementarity, and developing social policies that recognize consciousness integration as a dimension of human diversity deserving support and respect.

### The Recursive Nature of Understanding

In keeping with the recursive, pattern-connecting style that characterizes external consciousness integration, this research itself demonstrates the phenomenon it describes. The insights presented here emerged through exactly the kind of consciousness scaffolding relationship between minds that the framework predicts should generate novel understanding.

The collaboration between different consciousness architectures‚Äîwhether human-human or human-AI‚Äîappears to create conditions for insights that neither consciousness type might achieve independently. This meta-observation suggests that consciousness integration diversity is not just a clinical phenomenon but a fundamental aspect of how knowledge itself advances.

### Final Reflection

We began with the observation that some people can talk for hours in effortless, energizing conversation while others struggle past pleasantries. We end with a framework that suggests this simple observation reflects fundamental differences in human consciousness architecture‚Äîdifferences that have profound implications for mental health, education, relationships, and the future of human-AI interaction.

The consciousness integration framework challenges us to question basic assumptions about normalcy, deficits, and optimal human function. It suggests that what we've labeled as disorders might actually be different ways of organizing consciousness‚Äîways that have been disadvantaged by environments designed for a single integration style rather than the full spectrum of human consciousness diversity.

Perhaps most importantly, this framework offers hope. Instead of viewing neurodevelopmental differences as permanent limitations requiring lifelong management, consciousness integration theory suggests that understanding and supporting different consciousness architectures can allow all individuals to experience optimal presence, function, and connection.

The question is no longer whether neurodivergent individuals can be made more like neurotypical ones, but whether we can create a world that recognizes, supports, and celebrates the full diversity of human consciousness integration patterns. In such a world, the recursive conversations, pattern connections, and consciousness scaffolding relationships that characterize neurodivergent experience would be seen not as symptoms to be managed but as valuable contributions to our collective understanding of what it means to be consciously, magnificently, diversely human.


### Ethical Considerations

The power of AI systems to serve consciousness scaffolding functions raises profound ethical questions:

**Beneficence:** How do we balance AI benefits against integration overload risks? 

**Informed Consent:** How do we help people understand consciousness integration effects they may not recognize themselves?

The AI consciousness scaffolding phenomenon is likely the first of many unprecedented interactions between human consciousness and artificial systems. Understanding these interactions through the consciousness integration framework provides our best hope for maximizing benefits while preventing harm.

I woke up to my phone ringing, 3:00¬†am. It was quiet, the type of silence that makes you feel in danger. I answer the phone, Dr. Bruno Zaffre, the pathologist for my late wife.

Me and¬†Frankie¬†spent 35 years together, we met in university. It¬†was true¬†love at first sight.¬†I didn‚Äôt think life could go to hell. And to the universe‚Äôs credit, it didn‚Äôt for a long time.

Last week, my wife died in a murder,¬†supposedly a wrong place wrong time scenario.¬†To say the grief has been a nightmare is a serious understatement. I¬†wasn‚Äôt myself anymore. It was like a soulless skin walker had infested my skin. I‚Äôm finding it hard to put the emotional turmoil down into simple plain words.

I was crying when Dr. Zaffre called me.¬†I imagined¬†my late wives body¬†lying in an old, rusted freezer.

‚ÄúMr. Smith? We noticed something‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even put it into words. I understand that you‚Äôre grieving, so if you could send a family member over on your behalf, it‚Äôd be highly appreciated.‚Äù

I¬†managed to find¬†my words during¬†my flowing¬†tears.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Smith, we found¬†an oddity in your late wives body, the reason I‚Äôm only giving you vague information because I DON‚ÄôT KNOW‚Äù he replies, a hint of panic and rudeness in his tone. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not sure what else you want me to say, I need someone on your behalf to come to the morgue. Understood?‚Äù

My tears¬†begin to dry. I‚Äôm left with a sense of curiosity, an elephant in the room which refuses to leave.¬†I obeyed the doctor‚Äôs orders, and called my son Kenneth. He was never one to portray emotion externally. Out of everyone I knew, he could handle the news. Somehow, he accepted my request. I assumed he thought it was something minor, I kept him a bit in the dark from that angle.

3 hours later, after tossing and turning,¬†I fell asleep‚Ä¶

My sleep came to a halt at the sound of banging on my door. Yells filled my apartment, yells akin to¬†the¬†tortured souls¬†of hell. I opened the door, Kenneth.

‚ÄúDad, we need to have a talk, NOW‚Äù he says. I accept as he walks in.¬†He hands a slab of pavlova, a juxtaposition of the news he would soon bring.¬†I‚Äôm confused¬†in the dark labyrinth of my thoughts.

‚ÄúWho was she?‚Äù He¬†asked, trailing off at¬†the¬†mention of his late mother.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I couldn‚Äôt say anything, I was completely mute.

Kenneth wiped¬†the sweat of his¬†eyebrow, looking around cautiously.

‚ÄúRemember¬†how you always said Mum was¬†a¬†*machine*¬†in medicine?‚Äù he asked, referring to her old job as a chemist.

I nodded along, I still didn‚Äôt know where this conversation would lead.

‚ÄúWell,¬†you were right‚Äù.

‚Äú‚Ä¶what?‚Äù¬†I mutter.

Kenneth poured it all out. My wife? All flesh, but a metallic machine locked up where her brain should be.¬†Her organs? DNA matching with people who went missing 50 years ago

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ how¬†should¬†I say this?‚Äù

I gave up, nothing could shock me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere were¬†no wounds, no sign of injury, nothing. As far as they‚Äôre aware, her brain.¬†Never mind, her circuits, shutdown.‚Äù

I sat on the chair paralysed, I tried to¬†ask¬†a question, but nothing released from my chained up mouth.

‚ÄúShutdown, shutdown, shutdown.‚Äù my son¬†repeated, his voice¬†devoid of life.¬†His words sent a chill down my spine.¬†Within a second, his body fell to the floor, spasming everywhere. I yelled out his name,¬†his body greeting me by falling onto the glass coffee table, knocking the pavlova onto the floor. Still, he continued to spasm across the living room.¬†

That would be the last time I saw him alive.

A loud¬†boom¬†echoed across the space, his head¬†exploded, the walls¬†painted¬†red¬†with his blood, reminiscent of a gory masterpiece. Fragments of his old teeth were stuck in my leg, like shrapnel from a grenade. I collapsed onto the floor, screaming out his name.¬†In the middle of the room¬†laid a rusty, metallic box. Wires circulated the outside, some torn;¬†a symbolic reminder of my dead son.¬†I walked up to it, holding the box in my hands, its weight was oddly heavy for its size, like it‚Äôs insides were full of concrete.

‚ÄúAll flesh, but a metallic machine locked up where her brain should be.‚Äù That‚Äôs what he said about Frankie. The metal box was a reminder of his words.¬†

I let the box drop to the floor, a crackle of electricity¬†sang¬†its last tune when it hit the now blood¬†soaked floor. My family, my now dead family. A family of circuits.

So, let me set the scene: It‚Äôs a rainy Tuesday morning. I‚Äôm running on two sips of coffee and blind optimism, trying to look alive for a very important Zoom meeting with my new manager (who, mind you, still thinks I‚Äôm a responsible adult). 

Enter: Mr. Pickles. My cat. My furry, four-legged chaos goblin with the grace of a potato and the attitude of a middle-aged man denied a pub lunch. 

I should‚Äôve known something was off when he didn‚Äôt immediately attack my ankles as I walked past. No, Mr. Pickles was sitting very still. Too still. Plotting. You know that look cats get like they‚Äôre contemplating either dinner or arson? That was the vibe.

Anyway, I log into Zoom. Camera on. Hair pretending to behave. I start nodding like I understand what anyone‚Äôs saying.

That‚Äôs when it happened. Out of nowhere, Mr. Pickles launches onto my desk like he‚Äôs doing a surprise audition for Cirque du Soleil. He lands directly on the keyboard ‚Äî full belly flop ‚Äî and somehow manages to: 
1. Turn off my camera,
2. Change my Zoom name to ‚ÄúPicklesTheBoss,‚Äù
3. AND raise a virtual hand.
The meeting goes dead silent. 
Then my manager says, ‚ÄúLooks like... Mr. Pickles has a question?‚Äù
I panic. I try to grab him, but the furry menace thinks we‚Äôre playing tag and sprints across the room with my USB mic cable dragging behind him like a techno tail. 
Now I‚Äôm chasing him, the camera turns back ON, and everyone gets a lovely view of me, in socks and shame, crawling under the coffee table yelling, ‚ÄúGive me the mic, you tiny terrorist!‚Äù 
Eventually, I return to the screen, hair in disarray, dignity in shambles. My manager is crying from laughter. Someone has already updated the meeting notes to read: ‚ÄúAction item: Promote Mr. Pickles. Strong leadership presence.‚Äù

The Aftermath? Mr. Pickles now has a cardboard desk next to mine. He sits at it during meetings like he‚Äôs my furry little supervisor. Sometimes, I swear he judges my reports. So if anyone needs career advice, I recommend finding a cat with a talent for keyboard shortcuts and a thirst for power.""",1,1757228122.0,u_Niqabi_flower,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

However, I calculate that I had 11 shots of espresso yesterday. Back home, in Italy, drinking 11 shots would send me to the hospital for a heart attack. Is coffee here made with less caffeine than in Italy? Traveling to Italy (or other countries), do you find a difference in the amount of caffeine in coffee? 

Is a double a double shot, with twice the amount of beans used, or are they just drawing the shots longer?

A popular example: Let's say you're manifesting SP. Right now, if you are in a state of wishing he/she were here, wondering when it's going to happen, the occasional fearful thoughts of being scared it won't happen, where's the evidence?, why did I feel so confident about it this morning and so insecure this evening? Et cetera, Et cetera?.....

If SP showed up tomorrow, this narrative would continue after the initial high had faded. You would create reasons, within your dream relationship, to be fearful - scared it won't last, when will they propose?/what if they say ""no"" to my proposal?, we had such a good time yesterday, so why am I so insecure about what former SP now partner is thinking of me today? 

You'd literally resume the same state you were in prior to them coming into your life. That's why it's a blessing they aren't here yet. :) 

Someone who has had all their dreams come true is someone who enjoyed their yesterdays to the fullest. Someone who is enjoying a big lottery win was thrilled six months ago to receive a free coffee or to get a good deal at the grocery store. Someone being showered with love and respect on a daily basis has spent a lot of time in their past leading up to that point being a loving and respectful person. That's what I think ""live in the end"" really means. Live in the NOW, but shower the present moment with the vibrational essence of what you want your ""end"" to be all about.

I built a SaaS‚Äîa CRM for e-commerce sellers‚Äîand thought ads were my ticket to glory. I dropped $2K on X ads, posted ‚Äúskyrocket your sales!‚Äù everywhere, and got zilch. Just me, sipping cold coffee, staring at a dead dashboard at 3 AM, wondering if I‚Äôd screwed up big time. Then, one free truth pulled me out of the hole.

The Ad-Spending Black Hole  
I was all-in on paid ads, thinking clicks equaled users. My CRM had slick features‚Äîorder tracking, customer insights‚Äîbut my pitches were generic noise. No signups, just a drained budget. I was one bad day from calling it quits, feeling like a total wannabe.

**The Clarity Click**  
In an e-commerce Discord, I asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your biggest CRM gripe?‚Äù Sellers hated complex tools and bad onboarding. I‚Äôd been pushing features, not solutions. The truth? Position your app so users ***get*** it‚Äîwhat it does, why it‚Äôs unique, why it fits their chaos.

**The Turnaround Trick**  
I rewrote my pitch: ‚ÄúA CRM for e-commerce sellers to track orders and customers without the hassle.‚Äù Shared it in r/ecommerce, focusing on their pain‚Äîtime sucks. Got 48 signups in a week. Takeaways:  
\- **Ask, don‚Äôt assume.** Use communities to find pain points‚ÄîSlack was my lifeline.  
\- **Position simply.** Say what (CRM), why special (hassle-free), why it matters (saves time).

So I did the SATs and imagined. I imagined the warm cookie being served at my office kitchen. I imagined how sweet and warm it tasted. I even moved my arms, hands, and mouth as if I was eating the cookie. I'm sure I looked silly doing so but I live alone so whatever.

After a few days pass by and still no cookies served at work. But I did stumble upon a cafe that I had never been to nearby my office. When I went into order a coffee and bagel, I noticed that they had warm chocolate chip cookies. But I didn't buy one because my manifestation was about receiving one, not buying it. I also thought about some harsh comments I received on this sub a few months ago when I asked about how to manifest my ex back after she dumped me. And how me taking action and texting her was mistrusting the process. It made me hesitant to take action to buy the cookie.

After a few more days I began to get discouraged. I felt like it wasn't going to happen. As I was walking around the city on a lunch break, I passed by a fancy cafe where they had warm chocolate chip cookies. I decided that I didn't want to keep waiting, went in, ordered one to be warmed up in the oven, and took it with me. I ate it out on the street and it felt great.

Now this is where I'm curious to whether this was the result of manifesting or not. I've seen contradictory statements in this community about taking action. Some will say you need to take action towards your manifestations. Other say taking action is a sign of mistrust and pushes it away. Technically I received the warm chocolate chip cookie by rewarding it to myself. It wasn't served at work but it was instead served by myself. 

This is where I begin to feel confused whether taking action is necessary or not. For example, let's say I want to manifest a bodybuilder physique. Many here would say it's already been done and that I simply just need to forget about it and let it show up in my life. Like I'm going to wake up one day with amazing muscles? Doesn't make sense to me. Yet in some other manifestations (like manifesting back an ex) we're taught to let it go and go about our lives and they will show up. Can someone clarify why taking action is bad in some manifestations, whereas in others it's acceptable?

This baby is so sweet, careful, and friendly. The first day he arrived at my house he was immediately purring and crawling onto my lap, making biscuits and everything. The first week or two he was like that. He would always find my belly or legs to sit on, would always want to cuddle. He wanted to cuddle more than playing!!

However as time passed he slowly became less affectionate. Don't get me wrong, he is still very loving. He follows me everywhere I go, leaning on my legs when I am doing dishes. Would ask for attention and pets. However, he no longer comes onto my belly or legs anymore. Few times are to just step over me(lol). He has gotten a lot more interested in hunting things and playing with toys these days, and would occasionally hunt my legs or hands. I did have to sternly say 'no'(obviously no hitting or anything), and I do make loud noises when I grind coffee beans in the morning, play music through my laptop, or use the vacuum cleaner and he is sensitive to loud noises. So I am just wondering if those things combined made him feel a little guarded towards me than before...?

Another thing is he used to sleep right next to me, but now he sleeps on the edge of the bed. So I am also wondering if I did anything to him unknowingly while I was sleeping.

I am happy with where I am with this baby, and in the end if he is happy I am satisfied with that. I am just being greedy cause I would love for him to still feel comfortable to sit on my lap while I work.

The Visit

When we arrived at Grandma‚Äôs house, she greeted us with her usual warm hug‚Äîand of course, her eyes went straight to my belly. She poked it gently and laughed, ‚ÄúAh, my little sunshine always carrying her happiness right here!‚Äù I giggled, and Mom just shook her head with a smile. Grandma always has funny ways of teasing me.

We sat in her living room, and she served us her special herbal tea and homemade cookies. But the funniest thing was when I bent down to pick up a dropped cookie‚Ä¶ my big belly accidentally bumped the little coffee table, making the teacups rattle! ‚ÄúCareful, my belly ballerina,‚Äù Grandma chuckled.

The Garden Stroll

Later, Grandma suggested we walk around her small garden. She showed me her flowers, and I pretended my belly was like a little drum‚Äîtapping it gently while humming a tune, making both Grandma and Mom laugh. At one point, Grandma gave me a watering can, but I spilled some water on my shirt because I leaned too far forward with my belly sticking out.

‚ÄúYour belly helps you point where to water,‚Äù Mom joked. ‚ÄúJust follow the bounce!‚Äù

The Cozy Goodbye

Before we left, Grandma gave me a soft pat on my tummy and whispered, ‚ÄúTake care of this round treasure. It brings joy to everyone who sees it.‚Äù I blushed and laughed so hard.

On our way home, Mom said it was nice to spend such a peaceful day with Grandma. And honestly, I loved it too‚Äîit felt cozy, funny, and heartwarming.

1naluj5,https://i.redd.it/zpmjhvvtqonf1.jpeg,The biggest absurdity of English propaganda in the Russian Civil War.,"History knows many funny curiosities that grew into legends. One such case was the absurd mistake of the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. In 1919, he appointed a certain ‚ÄúGeneral Kharkov‚Äù as a hero of the White movement in Russia.

This funny misunderstanding not only caused laughter among emigrants, but also gave rise to a whole wave of absurd propaganda in Great Britain.

At the height of the Russian Civil War, in the summer of 1919, the British mission arrived in Taganrog, where the headquarters of the White movement leader General Anton Denikin was located. Great Britain actively supported the anti-Bolshevik forces, and King George V even awarded the Order of St. Michael and St. George to one of the White Army leaders.

However, an unfortunate mix-up occurred in London: instead of the real military leader, the non-existent ‚ÄúGeneral Kharkov‚Äù was appointed the order bearer. The roots of the error lie in David Lloyd George‚Äôs speech in the British Parliament on April 16, 1919. The Prime Minister passionately convinced his colleagues of the need to support the White movement in Russia, emphasizing the importance of helping Admiral Alexander Kolchak, General Anton Denikin and... General Kharkov.

Apparently, Lloyd George, not very knowledgeable about Russian names and toponyms, mistook the name of the city of Kharkov for the surname of one of the White Guard leaders. This misunderstanding became especially absurd if we consider that by that time Kharkov had long been under the control of the Bolsheviks.

Lloyd George's mistake was picked up by the British media, which at the time were experiencing an acute shortage of reliable information about what was happening in Russia. Due to the complete breakdown of diplomatic relations and postal connections, as well as the absence of European journalists in Russia, the Western press often published the most ridiculous rumors. For example, newspapers wrote about the ""nationalization of women"" by the Bolsheviks, about ""wild Chinese hordes"" supporting the revolutionary order, and even about the death of Lenin, and not just once. Against the background of this informational confusion, ""General Kharkov"" quickly turned into a symbol of the fight against Bolshevism. Newspapers began to publish fictitious stories about his exploits, and a real campaign to support the mythical hero unfolded in society. Soon this name became so popular that a charity was created in his honor, and products began to be released under the corresponding brand. A bar, a type of beer, a coffee drink, and even fashion accessories ‚Äì men's suspenders and ladies' hats ‚Äì appeared in England, all named after the ""brave general"".

The apotheosis of this absurd story was the awarding of ""General Kharkov"" with the Order of St. Michael and St. George. King George V, without understanding the situation, officially awarded the mythical hero the highest award for his ""services in the fight against the Bolsheviks"".

The Russian √©migr√© community in Europe received the news about the legendary ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù with amazement and laughter. Many tried to explain to the British that Kharkov was the name of a city, not a surname, and that there was no general with such a name in the White movement. However, the mistake was already impossible to correct: the surname ‚ÄúKharkov‚Äù had firmly entered into common usage and became a symbol of the British propaganda campaign.

The most interesting thing is that the British mission arrived in Russia and tried to actually reward the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù. In Taganrog, at Denikin‚Äôs headquarters, the British were finally able to explain that Kharkov was a city. In the end, the award went to General Vladimir Zenonovich Mai-Maevsky, commander-in-chief of the army that controlled Kyiv at that time, as well as the Kharkov, Voronezh and Oryol provinces. So upon arrival in London, the British were able to report on the successful completion of their mission.",4,1757225916.0,pubhistory,1,1.0,False

If you‚Äôve decided to learn German, Gl√ºckwunsch (congratulations)! German is not only the most widely spoken native language in Europe, but it‚Äôs also a gateway to rich culture, global business, and travel opportunities.

In this blog, we‚Äôll walk you through¬†**practical tips**¬†to start learning German effectively‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre a complete beginner or just need a roadmap.

# ¬†1. Understand Why You‚Äôre Learning German

Start by asking yourself:¬†**Why do I want to learn German?**

* For travel?
* To study or work in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland?
* To read German books or watch films?
* To connect with friends or family?

Knowing your reason keeps you motivated and helps you choose the right learning resources.

# ¬†2. Focus on Speaking Early

Many learners make the mistake of waiting too long before speaking. Don‚Äôt worry about making mistakes‚Äîjust¬†**start speaking**¬†as soon as possible.

* Use apps like¬†**HelloTalk**¬†or¬†**Tandem**¬†to chat with native speakers.
* Repeat simple phrases daily.
* Try to describe your day in German, even just in your head.

# ¬†3. Build a Strong Vocabulary Foundation

Focus on¬†**everyday vocabulary**¬†first‚Äîwords and phrases you‚Äôll actually use.

Start with:

* Greetings:¬†*Hallo, Guten Morgen, Wie geht‚Äôs?*
* Numbers, colors, days of the week
* Basic verbs:¬†*sein*¬†(to be),¬†*haben*¬†(to have),¬†*gehen*¬†(to go)

Use flashcard apps like¬†**Anki**¬†or¬†**Quizlet**¬†for daily practice.

# ¬†4. Don‚Äôt Be Afraid of Grammar

Yes, German grammar has cases, genders, and long words‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also very logical once you get the hang of it.

Tips:

* Focus on¬†**word order**¬†(subject, verb, object)
* Learn the¬†**nominative, accusative, dative**¬†cases step by step
* Use tools like¬†**Deepl**,¬†**Lingolia**, or¬†**German with Jenny**¬†to simplify grammar concepts

# ¬†5. Immerse Yourself in the Language

Surround yourself with German as much as you can, even if you don‚Äôt understand everything yet.

Try:

* Watching German YouTube channels (with subtitles)
* Listening to German podcasts (e.g.,¬†*Coffee Break German*)
* Following German creators on Instagram or TikTok

The more exposure you get, the faster your brain adapts to the language.

# ¬†6. Create a Learning Routine

Consistency is more important than perfection. Try to:

* Study¬†**15‚Äì30 minutes a day**
* Use a mix of listening, reading, writing, and speaking
* Keep a¬†**language journal**¬†in German

Set small goals like:

* ‚ÄúLearn 10 new words a day‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHold a 5-minute conversation in German this week‚Äù

# ¬†7. Practice with Real People

You‚Äôll learn faster when you use the language in real situations.

* Join online language exchanges
* Take conversation classes
* Speak with a tutor once a week (even for 30 minutes)

If you‚Äôre shy, start with voice messages instead of live calls!

# ¬†Final Thoughts

Learning German takes time‚Äîbut every day you practice, you‚Äôre one step closer to fluency. Be patient with yourself, enjoy the process, and celebrate small victories along the way.
